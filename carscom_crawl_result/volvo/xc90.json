      "expert_review": "Volvo is very late to the sport utility vehicle party, but it doesn’t seem to matter. The Swedish automaker, part of Ford Motor Co.’s Premier Automotive Group, offers SUV-crazy America one of the best choices on the market with the all-new 2003 XC90.\n\nThe XC90 was engineered with safety as a top priority, with lots of attention paid to protecting occupants in case of a rollover, the cause of many fatalities in SUVs. The XC90 even boasts inflatable side curtain air bags for all three rows, an unusual feature in the luxury SUV segment.\n\nWe tested a top-of-the-line T6 model, which features all-wheel-drive and a twin-turbocharged in-line six-cylinder engine that makes 268 horsepower. It had $3,420 worth of options and a sticker price of $45,055.\n\nShe: I’m sure you’ve heard that old joke “What does a hen-pecked husband drive?”\n\nHe: Being a 25-year veteran, of course I know the answer — “Anything she wants him to.”\n\nShe: No, the answer is a Volvo. The implication is that she doesn’t care about his macho image. She cares about safety. That type of woman should be thrilled with Volvo’s first SUV. They’ve thought of just about everything, including a roof structure made of boron, which Volvo engineers say is stronger than conventional steel. Each seat has seat-belt pretensioners which automatically reel in occupants in an accident. A new system called “Roll Stability Control” brakes the outside front wheel whenever sensors detect changes that could indicate a potential rollover. There’s a whiplash protection system for front passengers. I could go on and on. The only thing they seem to have overlooked is a tire-pressure monitoring system for those Michelin Pilot tires on the uplevel model.\n\nHe: I admire and appreciate those world-class safety features, especially given all the publicity and controversy over the safety issues with SUVs. But I also think the XC90 may be the perfect package. It’s not a stodgy, van-like creation, but a sculpted, stylish vehicle that combines the best of Swedish design on the outside with a nice mix of leather, wood and matte metal on the inside. So why did I bump it down a grade from you? A couple of reasons. The seating comfort deteriorates the farther back you sit, with the optional third row giving you the worst seat in the house. There’s no head or leg room back there and the third row is difficult to access. Plus, you give up the extra cargo space. It’s not worth the extra $1,675 you have to pay to get the third row as part of a versatility package. And while the quality of materials is excellent in the XC90, the trim fits are not up to par for this luxury SUV. The carpet was pulling away from the center console and I found gaps in the plastic trim panels.\n\nShe: I agree with you. The XC90 works best as a five-passenger vehicle. In that form, it’s nearly perfect. I couldn’t help but give it five stars because there’s so much to like. That miniature, eight -inch tall tailgate is a snap to open and the upper hatch feels nearly weightless. Our T6 model came with a standard moonroof, leather upholstery, an in-dash, six-disc compact disc changer and illuminated, steering-wheel mounted radio and cruise controls. This all-wheel-drive XC90 performed valiantly in the snow during a nasty Michigan winter. It responded quickly to changing road conditions and gave me a real sense of security. I’m guessing you liked the twin-turbocharged, 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder engine, which makes 60 more horsepower than the base five-cylinder.\n\nHe: Yes, but it only has a four-speed automatic transmission. I don’t understand why a luxury SUV like this wouldn’t come equipped with a five-speed automatic. It would improve the Volvo’s mediocre gas mileage — only 15 miles per gallon in city driving and 20 mpg on the highway. On the plus side, the XC90 has exceptional ride comfort for an SUV. You won’t feel like you’re bouncing around in a truck. The steering is responsive and so is the handling.\n\nShe: From the driver’s seat it has the quietness of a luxury sedan. It doesn’t surprise me that Volvo leaned heavily on a group of women in California — professional women — as they developed their first SUV. The XC90 stands out with its attention to detail. OK, so it doesn’t have a Thigh Master. But all kidding aside, I am waiting for the day when Volvo comes up with a more affordable SUV for the masses. When you see $45,000 on the sticker, you know you are in pretty exclusive territory. Can you picture a $25,000 Volvo SUV? Now that would be a vehicle for a huge untapped market of hen-pecked husbands.\n\nPaul’s rating: Above Average\n\nLikes: Twin-turbo six packs plenty of power. Exceptional ride quality for an SUV. Responsive handling and steering. Sliding middle seat in second row. Excellent quality of materials. As quiet as a luxury car.\n\nDislikes: Needs a five-speed automatic transmission. Trim fits not up to par. No headroom/legroom in third row. Difficult to access third row. Mediocre fuel economy.\n\nAnita’s rating: World Class\n\nLikes: Handsome styling. Drives like a station wagon. World-class safety features. Fast-acting all-wheel-drive system. Miniature tailgate with nearly weightless upper hatch. Reverse warning system. Third-row seat folds flat easily. Strong boron steel roof structure.\n\nDislikes: Premium options inflate sticker to $45,000. No rear-seat climate controls. Lacks adjustable pedals and tire-pressure monitoring system. Blind spots because of rear headrests and wide pillars front and rear. Excessive tire and road noise in rear.\n\n2003 Volvo XC90 T6 AWD\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, seven-passenger sport-utility vehicle\n\nPrice(1): Base, $39,975; as tested, $45,055 (1)-Includes $660 destination charge.\n\nEngine: 2.9-liter I-6; 268-hp; 280 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/20 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Acura MDX, BMW X5, Infiniti QX4, Lexus RX330, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz ML\n\n12-month insurance cost(2): $1,598 (2)-Estimated by AAA Michigan.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhat it is: Redesigned last year, the XC90 is Volvo’s flagship SUV. It seats five people in two rows or seven in three rows, depending on the model, and comes with front- or all-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe Volvo XC90 is a mid-size, three-row luxury SUV with seating for six or seven with dual captain’s chairs or a second-row bench. The base engine is a 247-horsepower, turbocharged mild-hybrid 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive; an available upgraded version of this engine delivers 295 hp. At the top of the lineup, the XC90 Recharge plug-in hybrid has 455 hp courtesy of its gas-electric powertrain; that one is the quickest XC90 of the bunch, and it delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC90’s competitors include the BMW X5, Cadillac XT6, Lexus RX, Lincoln Aviator and Mercedes-Benz GLE.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe XC90 is carried over for 2024 with minor tweaks to its standard and available equipment. The line-topping Ultimate trim level gets laminated side windows for improved cabin quietness, as well as a newly available 22-inch wheel design. Volvo is slated to introduce the all-electric EX90 three-row SUV late in the 2024 calendar year as a 2025 model. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo XC90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nTwo USB ports\nQuad-zone climate control\nSeven seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRoad-sign recognition\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated second-row seats\nMassaging front seats\nAir suspension system\nWool upholstery\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nComfortable to drive, relatively good on gas and boasting an elegantly detailed cabin, the XC90 is a solid pick among three-row luxury SUVs. Yes, the third-row seats are best left to kids, but that’s true of a number of the XC90’s rivals, too. True to Volvo tradition, the XC90 has a strong track record for safety, and it performs well in crash tests. The plug-in-hybrid XC90 Recharge has the added bonuses of electric-only driving range and a serious horsepower infusion, but it costs considerably more than an XC90 with a mild-hybrid powertrain.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe Volvo XC90 is a mid-size, three-row luxury SUV with seating for six or seven, depending on whether a second-row bench or dual captain’s chairs are ordered. For 2023, the base engine is a 247-horsepower, turbocharged mild-hybrid 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. An available upgraded version of this engine delivers 295 hp. At the top of the lineup, the XC90 Recharge plug-in hybrid has 455 hp courtesy of its gas-electric powertrain. It’s the quickest XC90 of the bunch, and it delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric-only driving range. Competitors to Volvo’s largest and most expensive SUV include the BMW X5, Cadillac XT6, Lexus RX, Lincoln Aviator and Mercedes-Benz GLE.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volvo XC90?\n\nFor 2023, Volvo reshuffled and renamed the available trims of the XC90. These now consist of Core, Plus and Ultimate trims for both standard and plug-in models. The two mild-hybrid engine choices (named B5 and B6) replace the previous T5 and T6 gas-only powertrains. New option packages, dubbed Climate and Lounge, are available, and stand-alone features now include an upgraded Harman Kardon stereo and a head-up instrument display.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volvo XC90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nTwo USB ports\nQuad-zone climate control\nSeven-seat configuration\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRoad sign recognition\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated second-row seats\nMassaging front seats\nAir suspension system\nWool upholstery\nHands-free park assist\nSurround-view camera system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volvo XC90?\n\nComfortable to drive, relatively good on gas and boasting an elegantly detailed cabin, the XC90 is a solid pick among three-row luxury SUVs. Yes, the third-row seats are best left to kids, but that’s also true of a number of the XC90’s rivals. True to Volvo tradition, the XC90 has a strong track record for safety, and it performs well in crash tests. The plug-in-hybrid XC90 Recharge has the added bonuses of electric-only driving range and a serious horsepower infusion, but it costs considerably more than an XC90 with a mild-hybrid powertrain.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThis midsize luxury crossover has an available V-8 and seating for up to seven. Trim levels include 3.2, 3.2 R-Design and V8. All-wheel drive is standard on the V8 and optional on six-cylinder models. Competitors include the Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Cadillac SRX.\n\nNew for 2011\nFor 2011, the output of the XC90’s standard six-cylinder engine has increased slightly to 240 horsepower, and the crossover gains more standard features, including Bluetooth and Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the previous boxy angles, but the smoother, more modern look that’s been present since the early 2000s. The door handles and side mirrors are body-colored, and the mirrors incorporate turn-signal lights. The roof rails are silver-colored. The R-Design trim changes the look of the grille and adds rear skid plates. The V8 adds twin dual exhaust pipes. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 18-, 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard front fog lights\nStandard power-operated and heated mirrors\nStandard power moonroof\nOptional headlight washers\nOptional bi-xenon headlights with swiveling lenses\n\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes, as does the three-spoke steering wheel with audio and cruise controls. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is standard.\n\nThe XC90 seats five people in two rows, and a standard third-row seat bumps total seating capacity to seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back. (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet, 3 inches or shorter.) A built-in booster seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults up front.\n\nPassenger volume comes in at 101 cubic feet. Cargo volume behind the third row is 11.1 cubic feet. The rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. With all seats stowed, maximum cargo volume measures 85.1 cubic feet. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable leather or premium leather seating\nAvailable aluminum or real wood trim\nAvailable massaging and ventilated front seats\nStandard automatic dual-zone climate control\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional 650-watt, 12-speaker audio system\nOptional dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system\nOptional navigation system with real-time traffic\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe XC90 has two powertrain offerings, including a rare-for-Volvo V-8. The R-Design model gets a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front/rear stabilizer bars and firmer springs and struts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n240-hp, 3.2-liter six-cylinder with 236 pounds-feet of torque\n311-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 with 325 pounds-feet of torque\nFront- or all-wheel drive\nStandard six-speed automatic with clutchless-manual mode\nBoth engines run on regular gas\n\n\nSafety\nThe XC90 comes loaded with safety features. One notable feature is standard Roll Stability Control, which attempts to stop a rollover once it has started by cutting torque and applying individual brakes. There’s also a lower front cross member that makes for safer SUV-to-car impacts. Other safety features include:\n\n\nStandard front, front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes with brake assist\nStandard electronic stability and traction control\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional blind spot warning system",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe Volvo XC90 is a mid-size three-row luxury SUV with seating for six or seven people with dual captain’s chairs or a second-row bench. The base engine is a 247-horsepower, turbocharged mild-hybrid 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. An available upgraded version of this engine delivers 295 hp. At the top of the lineup, the XC90 T8 has 455 hp courtesy of its plug-in hybrid powertrain. That one is the quickest XC90 of the bunch, and it delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC90’s competitors include the BMW X5, Lincoln Aviator, Cadillac XT6, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Lexus TX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volvo XC90?\n\nVolvo updated the XC90 for mid-2025 with freshened front-end styling and a redesigned cabin, which now features a larger touchscreen running the brand’s latest software (early-production 2025 XC90s are carried over mostly unchanged from 2024). Additionally, Volvo is dropping the “Recharge” name from all its plug-in hybrid models, meaning that XC90 is now known as the T8. Also new for 2025 is the Volvo EX90, a fully electric version of the XC90 with up to 310 miles of driving range.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volvo XC90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.2-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nTwo USB ports\nQuad-zone climate control\nSeven seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRoad sign recognition\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated second-row seats\nMassaging front seats\nAir suspension system\nWool upholstery\nSurround-view camera system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volvo XC90?\n\nComfortable to drive, relatively good on gas and boasting an elegantly detailed cabin, the XC90 is a solid pick among three-row luxury SUVs. Yes, the third-row seats are best left to kids, but that’s true of a number of the XC90’s rivals, too. True to Volvo tradition, the XC90 has a strong track record for safety, and it performs well in crash tests. The XC90 plug-in-hybrid has the added bonuses of electric-only driving range and a serious horsepower infusion, but it costs considerably more than an XC90 with the standard mild-hybrid powertrain.",

      "expert_review": "I have fond memories of the Volvo XC90. It was one of the first vehicles I ever got to test for Cars.com, and it went on to earn our Best of 2016 award. Then, we bought one and proceeded to put 22,000 miles on it over the course of a year — more than we’ve put on any other winning vehicle we’ve bought, an indication of how much we loved it.\n\nRelated: Volvo Amps Up 2020 XC90 With Mild-Hybrid Version\n\nBut that was back in 2016, and the world seems to spin faster these days. Though it was just a few years ago, the XC90’s class has seen an influx of new products, and Volvo’s three-row SUV was starting to feel a little dated. For 2020, the XC90 gets what Volvo is calling a refresh, which includes a few usability and styling updates. I took a trip to the town of Banff, in Alberta, Canada, for a first drive of the updated XC90 to see if the love is still there. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\n2020 Volvo XC90 T8 Inscription | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nWhat’s New for 2020\n\nThere are some exterior styling changes, including a new concave grille, restyled front and rear bumpers, new wheel designs and some new color options. Roof rails, 19-inch wheels and integrated tail pipes are also standard now. R-Design models add gloss-black accents for the side mirrors, window trim and the roof rails. Aside from the grille, the changes will be hard to pick out — the XC90 was quite handsome before and still is, unrelated to these tweaks.\n\nInside, the changes are more substantial. A 12.3-inch display is now standard as the driver’s instrument panel, and the XC90 is now offered in a six-seat configuration with captain’s chairs for the second row. This no-brainer addition was always a curious omission for the XC90, which launched a four-seat edition of the SUV before this. The blind spot warning systems adds automatic braking as well.\n\nI tested two XC90s: a plug-in hybrid T8 Inscription model and a T6 R-Design, the sportier of the two with more aggressive styling and a gas powertrain. I was glad I got to drive both of them, because each model revealed something different about the updated XC90.\n\nT8 Inscription\n\nThe T8 Inscription is the creme de la creme of the XC90 lineup, its most luxurious trim level and its most powerful (and expensive) powertrain. The T8 combines a modified version of Volvo’s supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor that’s mounted to the rear axle. Total system output tops out at 400 horsepower and 472 pounds-feet of torque, which gives the XC90 plenty of scoot. For 2020, the battery’s capacity has also been enlarged to 11.6 kilowatt-hours (over the 2019’s 10.4 kwh) without making it any bigger. Volvo attributes the larger capacity to a “change in chemistry,” which makes me wish I could change the chemistry on my bank account.\n\nOn the road, the T8 accelerates confidently and shifts rather seamlessly between gas and electric power. Most of my driving was done in the standard Hybrid drive mode and I didn’t notice any weird transitions while accelerating. This was true of previous versions of the T8, as well. It’s not a very exciting powertrain, even with those power numbers; acceleration pours on rather than snaps forward, but it’s more than able to get the XC90 around with ease.\n\nWhere the previous T8 ran into a lot of trouble was in slowing down rather than going. Accelerating might have been seamless, but braking was anything but; weird transitions between the regenerative braking system and the mechanical brakes made stopping the XC90 T8 smoothly a difficult proposition. The braking system has been reworked for 2020 and is still a brake-by-wire system, but Volvo has added a hydraulic pump back into the system. This is a weird blend of new- and old-school technology, but the bottom line is that it works wonderfully. The brake pedal feels smooth underfoot and the XC90 stops predictably and consistently — it was immediately comfortable to use, which is one of the best things you can say about a braking system.\n\nT6 R-Design\n\nThere were fewer changes to be found in the T6 versions of the XC90, which has a carryover powertrain: a 316-hp, super- and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 295 pounds-feet of torque and comes mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Much like the T8, this engine easily moves the XC90 around, though without a lot of excitement. Volvo previously announced that a mild-hybrid kinetic energy recovery braking system would be added to T5 and T6 versions of the XC90 for 2020, but this system was not found on the T6 model I tested, so we’ll have to wait a bit longer to see how this addition pans out.\n\nThe T6 R-Design and the T8 Inscription I tested both came with the optional adaptive air suspension, which Volvo confirmed has comparable tuning in both models even though the R-Design is the sportier of the trims. There was a noticeable difference in ride quality between the two models, however: The R-Design has larger wheels (22 inches versus 21 inches on the Inscription), and it’s almost 450 pounds lighter than the hybrid T8, which made the T6 feel choppier, especially on imperfect roads. A bit more road noise and chatter from the suspension could be felt in the cabin, so if you live in an area where the roads need repair, this is something to watch out for.\n\n2020 Volvo XC90 T8 Inscription | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nRoom for Improvement\n\nThe six-seat configuration makes it much easier to climb into the third row due to a large gap between the captain’s chairs, but it doesn’t solve one of the XC90’s shortcomings: a snug third row. Headroom is good, but legroom is tough to come by. The XC90 fails the “three Brians” test, where I set the driver’s seat where I would drive and the second row to a comfortable but forward spot, then see if I can fit in the third row. I couldn’t sneak my knees behind the sliding second-row seat, so it would require compromise from the passenger to make the third row adult-sized.\n\nVolvo’s Sensus touchscreen system is also starting to feel a bit dated. The addition of processor power and a bump in RAM in 2019 was a godsend that at least helped the system boot up in a reasonable amount of time after you turn the XC90 on. The system was notable at first for having a vertically oriented touchscreen, but the screen isn’t notably larger than the other systems out there now, and having climate and heated-seat controls buried in a submenu remains a puzzling choice.\n\nAlso dated: a lack of device-charging options. There are only two USB ports to be found in the entire vehicle, both up front, which means that the second and third rows are left without a place to plug in. An SUV that is designed today would feature more ports, and this is probably something that Volvo will address in an XC90 redesign rather than the refresh we get now.\n\n2020 Volvo XC90 T8 Inscription | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nConclusion\n\nTaken comprehensively, the XC90 still impresses. Its interior materials and styling still very much hold up, the wood trim all has matching grain and the attention to detail is grin-inducing. It’s not a perfect vehicle; if you will be using the third row consistently and need more cargo room, then other models would serve better. The same is true if you want the latest and greatest in technology.\n\nThis is exacerbated a bit by the XC90’s pricing, which is a bit expensive. The T8 Inscription I drove stickered at $86,990 (including $995 in destination charges) and the T6 R-Design came in at $74,735, so it’s not cheap to get an XC90 with the bells and whistles.\n\nAfter driving the XC90 again, it reminded me of why I fell in love with it initially. The style, the easy-going driving experience and the well implemented safety features still make it a standout in this class — the sum is somehow greater than the parts.\n\nThe 2020 XC90 is on sale now.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis midsize luxury SUV has an available V-8 and seating for up to seven. Trim levels include 3.2, 3.2 R-Design and V8. All-wheel drive is standard on the V8 and optional on six-cylinder models. Competitors include the Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Cadillac SRX.\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the XC90 drops the V8 R-Design trim and adds standard heated front seats, headlamp washers and rain-sensing windshield wipers to the V8 model. The base 3.2 also gains a standard third row seat and moonroof.\n\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the previous boxy angles, but the smoother, friendlier look that’s been present since the early 2000s. The door handles and side mirrors are body-colored, and the mirrors incorporate turn signals. The roof rails are trimmed in black or aluminum. The R-Design trim changes the look of the grille and adds rear skid plates. The V8 adds twin dual exhaust pipes.\n\nThe vehicle is 189.3 inches long and 74.7 inches wide. It’s the shortest of its competitors and, with the exception of the SRX, also the narrowest.\n\nAvailable 18-, 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard front fog lights\nStandard power, heated mirrors with integrated turn signals\nStandard power moonroof\nOptional headlight washers\nOptional bi-xenon headlights with articulating lenses\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes, as does the three-spoke steering wheel with audio and cruise controls. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is standard. The XC90 seats five people in two rows and a third-row seat is standard with the base model. It bumps seating capacity to seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back. (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet, 3 inches or shorter). A built-in child-safety seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults up front.\n\nPassenger volume comes in at 101 cubic feet — the same as the X5. Cargo volume behind the third row is 11.1 cubic feet. The rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. With all seats stowed, maximum cargo volume measures 85.1 cubic feet, which is the best of the group.\n\nAvailable leather or premium leather seating\nAvailable aluminum or real wood trim\nAvailable massaging and ventilated front seats\nAvailable Sirius Satellite Radio\nAvailable rear seat refrigerator\nStandard automatic dual-zone climate control\nStandard audio and cruise controls on steering wheel\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional 650-watt, 12-speaker audio system\nOptional dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system\nOptional navigation system with real-time traffic\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe XC90 has two powertrain offerings, including a rare-for-Volvo V-8. The R-Design model gets a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front/rear stabilizer bars and firmer springs and struts.\n\n235-horsepower, 3.2-liter six-cylinder with 236 pounds-feet of torque\n311-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 with 325 pound-feet of torque\nFront- or all-wheel drive\nStandard six-speed automatic with manual shift functionality\n\nSafety\nThe XC90 comes loaded with safety features. One notable feature, especially on an SUV, is the standard Roll Stability Control, which attempts to stop a rollover once it’s started by cutting torque and applying individual brakes. There’s also a lower front cross member that makes for safer SUV-to-car impacts.\n\nStandard front, side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with brake assist\nStandard electronic stability and traction control\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional blind spot warning system",

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Volvo XC90 is not only a redesign, it’s a complete overhaul that’s stunning inside and out, with a host of technology that not only impresses, it works instinctively.\n\nOne of the first true luxury three-row SUVs on the market, the XC90 has been a huge success, but it took years for Volvo to give such an important car a significant update. Unlike the previous generation, last sold as a 2014 model, the redone XC90 doesn’t offer front-wheel drive. It comes only with all-wheel drive, but still seats seven occupants in three rows. See the 2014 and 2016 compared side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere’s not a lot of new ground in the realm of SUV styling, so it pays to go simple. Volvo has no problem with that; a simple, clean aesthetic is its calling card on almost all its vehicles, even during a recent design renaissance.\n\nThe XC90 stands out with an elegant design, thanks mainly to a large grille with 17 slats diagonally bisected by a rather large version of Volvo’s emblem.\n\nThe whole look is solidified by what Volvo is calling Thor’s Hammer LED headlights. Sadly, these lights are not standard on the base trim, called Momentum; they come on the R-Design and Inscription trim levels. The standard lights look fine, but I can’t remember a headlight I was more enamored with than this. That said, though, I’m not one to be overly enamored with headlights.\n\nThe rest of the exterior is what one would expect, and the horizontal rear taillights are a nice adaptation of what’s been used on Volvos for most of the past decade. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, and they look good. Twenty-, 21- and 22-inch wheels are available as well.\n\nHow It Drives\nOf all the XC90’s terrific attributes, the driving experience is somewhat lackluster. It’s not bad, just forgettable. In this space, though, among those likely to drive the XC90 to work, school, soccer practice and the regular road trip, that experience is likely what’s actually desired.\n\nThe only available engine is a new four-cylinder that’s both turbocharged and supercharged, good for 316 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The XC90’s standard transmission is now an eight-speed automatic, replacing the earlier generation’s six-speed.\n\nThe XC90 has more power than the V-6 engines in the Acura MDX and Buick Enclave, but less than the Land Rover LR4’s 340 horses. However, the Volvo’s EPA-estimated gas mileage of 20/25/22 mpg city/highway/combined is better than the Buick’s and Land Rover’s, and the combined rating bests the all-wheel-drive Acura.\n\nThis sweet spot of power and fuel economy translates to acceleration that’s acceptable but won’t excite. The Buick and Land Rover don’t excite either, but I was recently impressed with how fun the latest MDX’s engine is with its new transmission. You can compare them here.\n\nThe Volvo’s ride is terrific and should keep all three rows of passengers happily not bopping along to potholed roads, like those my family routinely traverses. Add that to the quiet cabin, and the XC90 is a lovely vehicle for long rides.\n\nThere are various driving modes, including one aimed at performance and one at fuel-efficient driving. I preferred the Normal setting to both Dynamic and Eco. In Dynamic the accelerator didn’t respond in a natural manner, and the adaptive suspension was too rough for the minimally improved handling response. In Eco mode, the right pedal barely reacted at all to pressure. I’d use it only in heavy traffic.\n\nInterior\nVolvo is known for sparse interiors, which makes it harder to connote a sense of luxury, but the XC90 does the job fantastically. That’s especially true in the top-of-the-line Inscription model I drove.\n\nBase models do have a number of leather seating choices, but only a simple brushed-aluminum trim is available. R-Design models get either silver mesh or black carbon fiber inlays.\n\nInscription models get a walnut inlay that looks fantastic along the door panels, dash and especially the center console, where a wood cover slides over the cupholders. It’s so pretty you might not want to open it to stow your coffee or bottled water.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable, and overall visibility is good. The second row of seats is comfortable for outboard passengers, and our test car had an optional built-in booster seat in the middle seat. My 6-year-old daughter loved sitting in the booster, which is a rather affordable $250 option. (Though she may have just been ecstatic to sit in a real leather seat instead of the less-posh materials she’s gotten used to in her lifelong use of child-safety seats.) Still, for a parent, this will come in handy.\n\nThe third row is less comfortable in terms of seat materials, which are noticeably thinner than the second row’s. Headroom is tough for full-grown adults. Shorter teens and tweens will find it acceptable, if a bit hard to reach, mainly due to a very narrow doorsill they’ll have to pivot over to get there.\n\nIf you shuttle a lot of people often, the standard four-zone climate control is a nice feature, allowing all three rows to control their airflow and temperature (the two front occupants get their own zones). I’ve also always been a fan of Volvo placing the second-row air vents high in the door pillars, so the air actually reaches rear passengers’ faces. The XC90 also features vents for the second row in the center console, like you find in most cars. Fellow parents of carsick kids will appreciate the added airflow.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nToday’s cars are more computer on wheels than ever, and Volvo is making a bold move by placing a single, large touch-screen in the middle of the dashboard to control nearly all in-car features, from air conditioning and navigation to safety features like lane departure warning. Only the Tesla Model S sedan compares in its use of an interface like this.\n\nIt’s essentially a 9-inch tablet seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, with a single physical home button at the bottom. Having tested nearly every touch-screen on the market, I imagined this execution would have problems. Most systems incorporate fewer functions, with a few more physical buttons to fall back on.\n\nThe XC90’s system is missing only the kitchen sink. And it works just fine.\n\nThe home screen shows the status of navigation, media, phone and system updates. Along the bottom of the screen are the climate control icons. Being able to access the standard heated and available cooled seats, fan speed, temperature and fan directly impressed me most.\n\nAll the controls react to touch quickly and, more important, predictably. The system isn’t flawless, though. While the everyday controls are done well, accessing the safety systems is a bit cumbersome, as is adjusting stereo settings, which are separated from the media menus where they belong.\n\nOur XC90 also had an optional 19-speaker Bowers & Wilkins sound system. After finding and adjusting that separate menu, it definitely sounded worth the $2,500 price tag to my ears. A 10-speaker system is standard.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe adaptive suspension comes in handy when accessing the cargo area, as the load floor is quite high. With the adaptive suspension, it can be lowered by a button to make it easier to reach. Overall room is adequate, if not exceptional.\n\nAt 15.8 cubic feet behind the third row, the XC90 is slightly larger than the MDX’s 15 cubic feet but smaller than the Enclave’s 23.3 cubic feet. I found it plenty large enough for a modest grocery trip, with more than acceptable space when the third row is folded flat.\n\nThe power liftgate is standard and opens automatically when you approach and stand at the rear of the XC90 for a few seconds.\n\nThere are plenty of cubbies and spaces in the cabin for the front passenger to stow keys, phones and other items, and many are easy to reach.\n\nSafety\nVolvo’s safety reputation is not going to be besmirched by the new XC90, which has earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That represents the highest possible score in all tests, including Superior for its front-crash prevention system. The XC90 had not been crash-tested by the federal government as of publication.\n\nThe SUV comes standard with some advanced safety features like lane departure warning and frontal collision mitigation, which alerts the driver to a possible frontal collision and slows the car to prevent it.\n\nOther features can be added in option packages, like a lane keeping aid I and some other editors felt was too aggressive. This was evident when driving on an under-construction highway with a semi-truck on one side and a concrete barrier on the other. As lane markings shifted, the system pushed the vehicle toward the barrier significantly enough to startle me. This is the exact scenario another editor experienced and expressed concern about.\n\nThe XC90 also scored well in our Car Seat Check, where it received mostly grades of A. Read the full report here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe base price of $50,795, including destination, might make your eyes pop, but when you take into account the standard all-wheel drive, power liftgate, navigation, heated front seats and panoramic moonroof, it’s not considerably more than competitors.\n\nHowever, we don’t see how buyers will be able to stay away from the top-end model, which looks better outside with those hammering headlights, and inside with the walnut trim.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The best line in 1990’s Crazy People, a movie starring Dudley Moore as an advertising executive whose attempts to tell the truth in ads landed him in a psychiatric hospital, was his presentation for a certain Swedish car.\n\n“Volvo. They’re boxy but good.”\n\nWhen Volvo lost its boxiness, some loyal customers would argue, the brand also lost its single-minded sense of purpose: Boxes are, after all, good for carrying stuff. Including people, perhaps.\n\nThose days are long gone. Nothing boxy about the 2007 XC90, which also means that, given its overall dimensions, it doesn’t carry as much as some of its competitors. Rear-seat room seems tight, and the optional third-row seat, which folds out of sight to the point where you might not even know it was there unless somebody told you, is for kids only.\n\nThe XC90 has been around since 2003. From the start, Volvo marketed it less as a traditional, trail-pounding SUV, more as a family-friendly hauler. If that sounds like “station wagon,” so be it, but Volvo calls it a “special-purpose vehicle.” Says so right on the window sticker.\n\nAs always, the XC90 remains one of the best-handling SUVs, and the ride is smooth but not quite plush. The test XC90 was a relatively basic, front-wheel-drive model, powered by a 3.2-liter inline six-cylinder engine, the one I liked so much in the new Range Rover LR3. Ford is, of course, the connection between Rover and Volvo — the company owns both. The transmission in the XC90 is a Japanese-built six-speed automatic.\n\nI was pleased with the powertrain, but if you want more power, there’s the XC90 V-8 AWD, which has a 4.4-liter, 311-horsepower V-8 and, as the name suggests, all-wheel-drive. You’ll pay for it, though: Our test XC90 started at $36,135, and the V-8 model starts at $46,425. A Sport model with that V-8 starts at $49,300.\n\nOne nice feature of the 3.2-liter six-cylinder model is fuel mileage — it’s EPA rated at 17 miles per gallon city, 22 mpg highway, but my overall mileage was a surprising 21.6 mpg.\n\nTypically Volvo, there’s a lengthy list of safety features, including stability control, traction control, side and side-curtain air bags, whiplash protection, rollover protection and several other features. Self-leveling xenon headlights were a neat $800 option. Other options, including that third-row seat, leather upholstery, a power moon roof and an upgraded stereo, brought the list price, with shipping, to $43,350.\n\nThat’s a premium price for a premium vehicle that lacked all-wheel-drive and a navigation system. Still, there’s a lot of content here in a complete, versatile package. And it doesn’t hurt that it’s pretty.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHaving undergone a number of updates for 2007, the Volvo XC90 sees few changes for 2008. The midsize luxury SUV has an available V-8 and seating for up to seven. Competitors include the Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Cadillac SRX.\n\nThe XC90 debuted in 2003 amid doubts about SUV safety, particularly with regard to rollovers. Thanks to an array of advanced safety features — seat belt pretensioners for all seats, side curtain airbags that stay inflated longer during a rollover, and an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology — the XC90 largely avoided the concerns that plagued its competitors. More recently, Volvo added swiveling headlights, a rearview camera and the automaker’s Blind Spot Information System, which monitors adjacent lanes for unnoticed vehicles. All three are optional.\n\nTrim levels include the six-cylinder — dubbed simply “3.2,” as in the engine’s size — as well as the V8 and V8 Sport. All-wheel drive is standard on the V8 and V8 Sport; it’s optional on the six-cylinder.\n\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the boxy angles of yore, but the smoother, friendlier look that’s been present since the early 2000s. Door handles and side mirrors are body-colored, and the mirrors incorporate turn signals. The roof rails are trimmed in black or aluminum.\n\nThe 3.2 has 17-inch wheels, while the V8 has 18-inchers. The V8 Sport comes with a sport suspension and 19-inch rims, as well as body-colored fenders, a chrome grille and silver scuff plates.\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes, as does a three-spoke steering wheel with audio and cruise controls. An optional backup system includes a rearview camera that maps the XC90’s projected path on a dashboard screen. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is now standard. The V8 model can now be had with Sapeli wood trim, which covers the shift knob and steering wheel, among other areas. An Executive Package adds upgraded floormats and swaps the standard leather for even softer hides.\n\nThe XC90 seats five people in two rows. An optional third row bumps capacity up to seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet 3 inches or shorter). A built-in child-safety seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults up front.\n\nThe rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. With all seats stowed, maximum cargo volume measures 92 cubic feet in five-seat models and 93.2 cubic feet in seven-seat models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine produces 235 horsepower and 236 pounds-feet of torque. The available 4.4-liter V-8 generates 311 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines use a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the XC90 can tow up to 4,960 pounds.\n\nSafety\nOffering unmatched safety in its segment, the XC90 comes loaded with four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with Roll Stability Control. RSC, now shared with various Ford, Mercury and Lincoln SUVs, anticipates impending rollovers with a gyroscopic sensor. It can attempt to avert them by cutting torque and applying individual brakes.\n\nSide-impact and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats are standard, with the latter designed to stay inflated longer in rollovers. All seat belts include pretensioners that cut slack in the event of a collision. Most seat belt systems include this provision only in the front seats.\n\nThe XC90 also receives Volvo’s Blind Spot Information System. BLIS adds a small camera to each outside mirror to measure movement in the driver’s blind spot and activate warning lights for the driver when necessary.\n\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights automatically rotate up to 15 degrees based on steering wheel input to illuminate corners better than conventional headlights.",

      "expert_review": "For 2006, Volvo addresses the only persistent gripe connected with its luxury sport utility vehicle: modest engine power.\n\nA powerful and refined V-8 engine is now optional for the XC90, putting this fine craft on equal footing with high-end SUVs from Mercedes, BMW, Infiniti, Lincoln and Cadillac.\n\nThe 4.4-liter, 311-horsepower engine is the first V-8 ever offered by Volvo and available only in the largest vehicle ever offered by Volvo. It replaces the previous 268-horsepower inline six, while the base model’s 2.5-liter turbocharged four remains in the lineup.\n\nIn this global marketplace, the engine comes to the big Swede from the other side of the world. Yamaha, the Japanese manufacturer of motorcycles and musical instruments, builds the compact V-8 for Volvo.\n\nThis is not the first time Yamaha has supplied a V-8 for Ford, which owns Volvo. The high-performance Taurus SHO of the early 1990s received its muscle from a similar Yamaha V-8. The Japanese company currently supplies high-revving four-cylinder engines for the performance versions of Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe.\n\nNaturally, the V-8 comes at a premium, adding nearly $10,000 to the price of the turbo-four XC90, although that includes a passel of luxury features and standard all-wheel drive. The new engine vastly widens the appeal of the Volvo for U.S. luxury drivers, who are accustomed to the silky muscle of powerful V-8s.\n\nNewfound performance, excellent drivability and, of course, Volvo’s longtime emphasis on safety moves XC90 to the head of the class.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The V-8 engine may be small (gearhead note: 4.4 liters is about 270 cubic inches) but has plenty of power, making this gentle giant feel light and lively. This advanced 32-valve engine includes variable intake and exhaust timing for power over a wide range of rpm.\n\nAcceleration is strong and smooth, with a subdued growl under the hood. Freeway cruising is seamless.\n\nXC90 delivers relatively good fuel mileage, considering the SUV’s 4,600-pound bulk and is rated by the EPA as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle.\n\nThe six-speed automatic was usually on the ball, though sometimes shifting with a noticeable thunk. Like the engine, the transmission is made in Japan.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Handling, steering and braking are all top drawer, especially for a heavy, high-profile vehicle. The XC90 challenges both BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz M-Class in every aspect of drivability.\n\nElectronic safety includes four-wheel ventilated disc brakes with antilock, brake-force distribution and brake assistance, Dynamic Stability Traction Control and Roll Stability Control.\n\nSTYLING: XC90 looks suitably muscular without macho affectations. Some people thought it looked too bulbous, more like a minivan than an SUV.\n\nINTERIOR: Comfortable, accommodating and stylish and with a high level of standard safety features, including full airbag and side-curtain protection, seat-belt pre-tensioners and whiplash protection.\n\nLeather seats, moonroof and a host of luxury gear come standard. XC90 seats seven, but the third row of seats is strictly for kids.\n\nThe dashboard controls are still somewhat haphazard and weird looking.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The V-8 option enhances an already superb SUV. The pricing is competitive, undercutting BMW and Mercedes with the same level of style, features and performance.\n\nPricing\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door SUV, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 4.4-liter V-8, 311 horsepower at 5,850 rpm, 325 pound-feet of torque at 3,900 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 112.6 inches.\n\nOverall length: 188.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,610 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 15 city, 21 highway.\n\nHighs: Engine refinement, lush interior, overall drivability.\n\nLows: Teeny rear seat, transmission thunks, haphazard controls.\n\nBase price: $45,840.\n\nPrice as tested: $49,480.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nTouring package, with alloy wheels, premium audio, wood steering wheel and trim, leather shift knob, $1,795.\n\nClimate package, with heated front seats, headlamp washers, $675.\n\nMetallic paint, $475.\n\nShipping, $695.",

      "expert_review": "Let me take a moment to introduce myself. I am not an automotive expert or car buff. I am a mother of two young children, and I spend my glamorous days in sweats, driving car pool and running errands. Sadly, I spend more time in my car than any other place. It’s this admission that fuels my quest to find the ultimate “mom-mobile.”\n\nMy first impression of the Volvo XC90 is that it’s not your typical SUV. It appears very sophisticated and expensive. I’m a little weary about throwing kids in the backseat, knowing it will soon be littered with cracker crumbs.\n\nMy fist task is to install my kids’ car seats. The Latch connectors are on the two outer seats of the second row, making car seat installation a cinch. I’m thrilled that I can easily fit a third car seat in the middle if I need to. My test vehicle arrived with an optional pop-up booster seat, which slides forward for easy access to your child. My daughter thinks this is cool and is extremely distraught that she does not yet meet the 33-pound minimum weight requirement for it. This particular version of the XC90 is a seven-seater with room for two more small people in the third row.\n\nNext I load up the cargo space. I am hugely impressed by the versatility of the Volvo XC90’s cargo area. With the third-row seats up I still have plenty of room for an umbrella stroller and all essential baby gear. The level of the cargo area is perfect for changing diapers when you’re on the run with no proper changing table in sight. I’m finally ready to jump in. The driver’s seat adjusts in eight ways and easily accommodates my towering 5-foot-2 stature (and has memory to store my seating configuration). The steering wheel not only tilts up and down, but telescopes in and out as well. I’m disappointed, though, that the foot pedals don’t adjust in height. That is the only thing that would make the Volvo XC90 more comfortable to drive.\n\nThe storage compartments in the test vehicle are plentiful. The center console has room for two coffee cups (or sippy cups), eight CDs and a pack of gum. Dual net compartments on the back of the front seats make storing coloring books effortless. I love the additional dry cleaning hooks in the cargo area. I can use these without the dry cleaning bags hanging over my children, risking imminent suffocation.\n\nWhen pulling out of the garage, the optional reverse warning system (an addition $400) comes in handy. If I get within 5 feet of an object it starts to beep, and it warns me when I come within one foot of the object. This is particularly useful for avoiding Fido on my way out.\n\nThere is one last fabulous family-friendly feature available on the Volvo XC90 that I want to rave about. The rear headphone outlets (standard if you have a third-row seat) are heaven-sent for parents. You can have up to four children in back listening to Barney, and the best part is you don’t have to hear a single note of it. A car full of silent children is priceless for an overworked parent.\n\nOverall, the Volvo XC90 makes a lovely mom’s car. It has the flexibility to grow with you and your family from birth to college, and it will do it all in high style and comfort. Stay tuned for more of my quest for the perfect family car. Next up: A road trip adventure in the highly publicized Nissan Quest.\n\n*For addition information on the Volvo XC90 and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Volvo’s best-selling vehicle, the XC90, which arguably is the best crossover sport utility on the market, now comes with optional V-8 power.\n\nIn the case of the XC90, this might be a matter of poor timing, seeing as how gasoline prices have spiked this year. I can’t imagine going out and buying a V-8 anything right now, unless I needed the extra power to pull a trailer, for instance.\n\nSo if you’re among the crowd of those who believe that to be a real car, a vehicle has to have a V-8, then this new XC90 4.4-liter V-8 model might be for you.\n\nBut as I’ve said before, those of us who have been Volvo fans for decades probably would agree that putting a V-8 in the XC90 or any Volvo, for that matter, borders on the absurd.\n\nNot only do you have to pay more to get the V-8 to start with, but you’ll end up paying more to drive it because of the extra fuel it consumes. Volvo’s turbocharged five-cylinder engine, which is the base powerplant in the XC90, gets a respectable 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway; upgrade to the V-8, and those numbers drop to 14 city/20 highway.\n\nThat’s similar, however, to the published fuel economy of the turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine that is now the midlevel offering in the XC90 — 15 city/20 highway — so I suppose that anyone considering the six might opt for the V-8 just to get the extra horsepower and torque. But I’ve tested the five-cylinder XC90, and I found it to have more than adequate power for my needs, although I didn’t have any trailers to tow.\n\nUnless you actually need the extra power, you can save a bunch of money buying the five- or six-cylinder model. Base price of our 2005 V-8 test model was $45,395 (plus $695 freight), while the six-cylinder model starts at $41,015, and the five-cylinder at a quite affordable $34,840 (well, affordable for those looking to buy a premium SUV, that is).\n\nCompared with the five-cylinder, the V-8 costs nearly $11,000 more. And even the $4,380 difference you’d pay for the V-8 vs. the six-cylinder might be hard to justify, considering that you already get 268 horsepower and 280 foot-pounds of torque with the six-cylinder, vs. 311 hp. and 325 foot-pounds of torque with the V-8. Some SUVs on the market have V-8 engines with less horsepower (example: the 4.7-liter V-8 in the Jeep Grand Cherokee: 230 hp.).\n\nI can understand why for competitive reasons Volvo felt that it needed a V-8. Some of the key competitors of the XC90 offer V-8 engines, including the BMW X-5, Cadillac Escalade, Mercedes-Benz M-class, Lincoln Navigator and Aviation, Land Rover LR3, Toyota 4Runner, and even the new Saab 9-7X. But it seems to be a bit of overkill, especially for a vehicle that has been touted for its safety.\n\nThe turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine in the XC90 has plenty of power, and even five-cylinder engine is adequate for many people’s needs, with its 208 horsepower and 236 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nMaintenance-wise, the new V-8 might have an edge. It is normally aspirated, so you don’t have to worry about turbocharger problems that might crop up with the five- or six-cylinder engines. But beyond that, it’s hard to make a case for the V-8. Volvo says no turbocharger is needed with that much power already on hand.\n\nThe new V-8 in the XC90 isn’t made by Volvo, though. It does come from a well-respected Japanese company — Yamaha — so it should offer many miles and years of trouble-free service. Yamaha developed the engine specifically for use in the tight engine compartment of the XC90. Volvo said the engine had to be engineered into a 60-degree V instead of the usual 90-degree layout just so it could fit without having to add length to the car to accommodate the extra cylinders.\n\nI suspect that Volvo’s prediction will be right: Most buyers of the XC90 will come from other brands, particularly ones whose SUVs all have V-8 engines. The V-8 version of the XC90 apparently isn’t meant for us longtime Volvo fans.\n\nThe XC90, Volvo’s first SUV, is typically Volvo, though: a great vehicle, loaded with luxury amenities and the best safety features money can buy. It’s also quite stylish, which is something new that has been added across the board at Volvo in the past few years as Ford Motor Co., which owns Volvo, has pushed the brand into the mainstream.\n\nBased on the unibody chassis of Volvo’s flagship S80 sedan, the XC90, introduced in 2003, is among the new crop of crossover SUVs, which have the shape, size and convenience of truck-based SUVs, but are built on car chassis and therefore have the ride and handling characteristics of cars. As with the other car-based SUVs, the XC90 isn’t intended for off-road use.\n\nBut it hits the mark perfectly its targeted consumers: active families who need a well-made, comfortable and secure vehicle for everyday commuting and kid-hauling, as well as the occasional highway trip.\n\nVolvo, which began developing the XC90 about two years before becoming a subsidiary of Ford, said that the main reason it took so long to bring an SUV to market was that the vehicle had to be a Volvo first, then a sport utility. That meant that Volvo needed to engineer it from the ground up to include the kinds of safety features found in other Volvo vehicles.\n\nFor Volvo, the challenge was to design a vehicle with SUV attributes, yet keep it safe enough for moms and kids. The answer was to use a low-slung car chassis, but put a platform in the floor to build up the passenger compartment while keeping the center of gravity low. As a result, the front seats of the XC90 are at least 6.5 inches higher than the seats in the Volvo XC70 station wagon, yet the center of gravity is just 3.5 inches higher.\n\nTo help control the vehicle during extreme maneuvers, Volvo included an electronic stability control system. This system automatically uses braking and engine speed reduction to help keep the car under control during events such as a drastic swerving. In the event a rollover does occur, this car is better prepared than most to protect its occupants. The roof is specially reinforced to withstand rollovers, and there is a side-curtain air bag system designed to inflate as a rollover begins and stay inflated until the rolling stops. It is triggered by a gyroscope that detects the beginning of a rollover. The XC90 has lower sub-bumpers front and rear that match the bumpers of normal cars, thereby preventing the SUV from running up over the fronts or rears of the other cars.\n\nAlthough some SUVs have third-row seats that are just a few inches in from the tailgate, the XC90’s seat is 18 inches from the rear of the car, and is mounted higher than normal to help protect the passengers in that seat — usually children — in the event the XC90 is rear-ended.\n\nOur test model came with the same front-wheel-drive system as the S80, but an all-wheel drive system is offered for $1,750 extra. The V-8 engine is connected to a six-speed automatic gearbox. The XC90 has room for up to seven people, and even with the third seat in place, there is 11.1 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nStandard features abound in the XC90, including leather seats, power windows/mirrors/door locks with memory remote control, power eight-way adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone electronic climate control, tilt and telescoping steering column, trip computer, roof rails, 12 cup holders, in-dash AM/FM/CD player with steering-wheel controls, cruise control, and heated outside mirrors.\n\nOur vehicle came with a touring package ($1,795) that added a 18-inch alloy wheels, premium sound system with six-disc in-dash CD player, wood trim and steering wheel, and leather shift knob; and a convenience package ($1,300) that tacked on rear park assist, cargo net and cover, power child locks, and power retractable side mirrors. Metallic paint added $475 to the sticker, which totaled $49,660 (including $695 freight).\n\nThe tank holds 21.1 gallons of fuel, and unleaded premium is recommended (but not required). G.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe XC90 midsize luxury crossover has seating for up to seven people in three rows and offers a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Competitors include the Acura MDX and Volkswagen Touareg.\nNew for 2013\nThe XC90 gets freshened exterior styling for 2013 with the addition of standard body-colored front and rear bumpers, sills and wheel arches; a silver front bumper bar; and LED daytime running lights and taillights. New standard features include headlight washers and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Meanwhile, the cabin gets white instrument lighting and aluminum inlays.\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the previous boxy angles, but the smoother, more modern look that’s been present since the early 2000s. The door handles are body-colored, and the side mirrors incorporate turn-signal lights. The roof rails are silver-colored. The R-Design trim changes the look of the grille. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 18- or 19-inch alloy wheels\nStandard front fog lights\nStandard power-operated heated mirrors\nStandard power moonroof\nStandard headlight washers\nStandard rain-sensing windshield wipers\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is standard.\n\nA standard third-row seat allows for a maximum seating capacity of seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back. (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet 3 inches or shorter.) A built-in booster seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults in the front row. The rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard leather seats\nStandard automatic dual-zone climate control\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system\nOptional navigation system with real-time traffic info\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe XC90 has one engine and transmission offering but is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The R-Design model gets a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front and rear stabilizer bars and firmer springs and struts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n240-horsepower, 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine with 236 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission with clutchless-manual mode\n\nSafety\nThe XC90 comes loaded with safety features. One notable feature is standard Roll Stability Control, which attempts to stop a rollover once it has started by cutting torque and applying individual brakes. There’s also a lower front cross member that makes for more compatible SUV-to-car impacts. Other safety features include:\n\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes with brake assist\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nOptional blind spot warning system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe XC90 midsize luxury crossover has seating for up to seven people in three rows and offers a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The V-8 model is no longer offered. Competitors include the Acura MDX and Volkswagen Touareg.\n\nNew for 2012\nIn a sign of the times, the 4.4-liter V-8 engine is no longer offered, so all models come with a 3.2-liter six-cylinder. The number of offerings has expanded with the addition of Premier Plus and Platinum trims. For the regular 3.2 version, the Premier Plus includes a compass integrated into the rearview mirror, a garage door opener and adaptive xenon headlights. The Platinum adds a premium stereo, navigation system with a backup camera and a blind spot monitoring system.\n\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the previous boxy angles, but the smoother, more modern look that’s been present since the early 2000s. The door handles and side mirrors are body-colored, and the mirrors incorporate turn-signal lights. The roof rails are silver-colored. The R-Design trim changes the look of the grille. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 18- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard front fog lights\nStandard power-operated heated mirrors\nStandard power moonroof\nOptional headlight washers\nAvailable bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with swiveling lenses\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes, as does the three-spoke steering wheel with stereo and cruise controls. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is standard.\n\n\nA standard third-row seat allows for a maximum seating capacity of seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back. (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet 3 inches or shorter.) A built-in booster seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults in the front row. The rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard  leather seats\nAvailable aluminum trim\nStandard automatic dual-zone climate control\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system\nAvailable navigation system with real-time traffic\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2012 XC90 has one engine and transmission offering but is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The R-Design model gets a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front and rear stabilizer bars and firmer springs and struts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n240-hp, 3.2-liter six-cylinder with 236 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic with clutchless-manual mode\n\nSafety\nThe XC90 comes loaded with safety features. One notable feature is standard Roll Stability Control, which attempts to stop a rollover once it has started by cutting torque and applying individual brakes. There’s also a lower front cross member that makes for safer SUV-to-car impacts. Other safety features include:\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes with brake assist\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nAvailable blind spot warning system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis midsize luxury SUV has an available V-8 and seating for up to seven. Trim levels include 3.2 and 3.2 R-Design (a new sporty trim), as well as V8 and V8 R-Design. All-wheel drive is standard on the V8 and V8 R-Design, and it’s optional on the six-cylinder. Competitors include the Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Cadillac SRX.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe XC90 is now available with an R-Design appearance package on some models. A new optional Executive Package (on V-8 models) adds premium leather and heated front and rear seats, plus ventilation and massaging functions for the front seats.\n\nExterior\nThe XC90 carries Volvo’s familiar face — not the boxy angles of yore, but the smoother, friendlier look that’s been present since the early 2000s. Door handles and side mirrors are body-colored, and the mirrors incorporate turn signals. The roof rails are trimmed in black or aluminum. R-Design trims change the look of the grille and add rear skidplates. The V8 trim adds twin dual exhaust pipes.\n\nThe vehicle is 189.3 inches long and 74.7 inches wide. It’s the shortest of its competitors and, with the exception of the SRX, is also the narrowest.\n\nAvailable 18-, 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard front fog lights\nStandard power heated mirrors with turn signals\nStandard power moonroof (optional on base 3.2)\nOptional headlight washers\nOptional bi-xenon headlights with articulating lenses\n\nInterior\nThe dashboard and instrument panel dome employ slanted, angular themes, as does a three-spoke steering wheel with audio and cruise controls. Various console knobs have chrome coverings, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is now standard. The XC90 seats five people in two rows. An optional third row bumps capacity up to seven, but it’s a tight squeeze in back (Volvo recommends the third row for occupants 5 feet, 3 inches or shorter). A built-in child-safety seat in the second row adjusts forward up to 12 inches to keep children closer to adults up front.\n\nPassenger volume comes in at 102.4 cubic feet — the same as the X5. Cargo volume behind the third row is 8.8 cubic feet. The rear seats fold down, as does the front passenger seat. With all seats stowed, maximum cargo volume measures 93.2 cubic feet, which is the best of the group.\n\nAvailable cloth, leather or premium leather seating\nAvailable aluminum or real wood trim\nStandard automatic dual-zone climate control\nStandard audio and cruise controls on steering wheel\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional 650-watt, 12-speaker audio system\nOptional dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system\nOptional navigation system with real-time traffic\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe XC90 has two powertrain offerings, including a rare-for-Volvo V-8. When properly equipped, the XC90 can tow up to 4,960 pounds. R-Design models get a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front/rear stabilizer bars and firmer springs and struts.\n\n235-horsepower, 3.2-liter six-cylinder with 236 pounds-feet of torque\n311-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 with 325 pounds-feet of torque\nAvailable front- or all-wheel-drive systems\nStandard six-speed automatic with manual shift functionality\nStandard self-leveling rear suspension (optional on base 3.2)\nStandard speed-sensitive power steering (optional on base 3.2)\n\nSafety\nOffering unmatched safety in its segment, the XC90 comes loaded with safety features. One notable feature, especially on an SUV, is the standard Roll Stability Control, which attempts to stop a rollover once it’s started by cutting torque and applying individual brakes. There’s also a lower frontcross member that provides for safer SUV-to-car impacts.\n\nStandard front, side and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with brake assist\nStandard electronic stability and traction control\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional blind spot information system",
