      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Volvo EX30 a Good Electric SUV?\n\nIt’s certainly a quick one. For fans of Scandinavian minimalism, the EX30’s eco-friendly, upscale interior will be a hit — assuming those fans can fit inside the cramped cabin. An increased starting price over what was initially announced, however, makes the EX30 a less appealing choice in today’s market.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Volvo EX30 Compare With Other Electric SUVs?\n\nFew electric vehicles match the drama of the EX30’s exterior or the simplicity of its interior, but many do a better job being a relatively affordable second car or city runabout, often at a lower price. Given our test vehicle’s price — which approached $50,000 — the list of alternatives is long and diverse.\n\nThe 2025 Volvo EX30 had a lot going for it when it was first announced: a sub-$40,000 starting price, a driving range close enough to 300 miles that many buyers would consider it, daring exterior styling and more. That was back in 2023, however, and the world is a bit different today. Contrary to what was initially planned, the U.S. will be getting only the priciest Twin-Motor Performance version, at least for now; a more affordable single-motor variant has been relegated to the back burner. A dual-motor Cross Country version is on the way for the 2026 model year.\n\nRelated: When Trends Collide: Electric 2026 Volvo EX30 Gains Cross Country Derivative\n\nWe tested an Ultra trim level that arrived in a glowing coat of paint, dubbed Moss Yellow; it’s named for “the yellow reindeer lichen, or polar moss, that grows on the rocks” in Swedish forests. The color grew on me (pun intended), and I really enjoyed the EX30’s sharp and futuristic exterior aesthetics. The sole option on our test car was a $500 Climate Package, which added heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. All in, the EX30 we drove was priced about as far away as possible from the affordable starting price Volvo had previously announced: It had an as-tested price of $48,395 (all prices include destination).\n\nOnce we got past the initial shock of its paint and styling, would the EX30 impress?\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Volvo EX30 Cost?\nPlus: $46,195\nUltra: $47,895\n\nThose prices are before any options, though once you add a heated steering wheel and heated seats to the Ultra, the remaining options are mostly accessories. The EX30’s near-$50,000 starting price puts this commuter-oriented small SUV in the territory of several decently sized (and longer-range) electric SUVs like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and refreshed 2026 Subaru Solterra.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Volvo EX30 Twin-Motor Performance Drive?\n\nQuickly. It drives very quickly. Volvo quotes a 0-60 mph time of just 3.4 seconds for the 422-horsepower Twin-Motor Performance version, which would make this little EV the quickest Volvo ever made. Unfortunately, it lacks the tires to put that power to the ground in everyday situations; I found it incredibly easy to spin the tires under hard acceleration. While the EX30 may approach the 0-60 time of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, Volvo didn’t bother to add anything to rival the (significantly more expensive, to be fair) Ioniq 5 N’s performance in any way but a straight line.\n\nWas forgoing tire grip and handling performance worth it just to eke out an EPA-estimated 253 miles of range while maintaining significant straight-line speed? I’m not so sure. The EX30 is more efficient than a similarly equipped Mustang Mach-E, Ioniq 5 or ID.4, but, for my money, I’d rather have normal EV acceleration — which is still very quick — and more range. Winning stoplight drag races when I’m the only one knowingly participating gets old pretty quickly, and little else about the EX30’s driving experience makes it worth recommending. Its steering feels numb even by EV standards, with only vague feedback, and its ride is painfully firm.\n\nOn top of that, this Volvo’s driver aids can be annoying and intrusive. The driver attention monitor kept alerting me that I was tired and needed a break. Thank you, Volvo, for reminding me I have a 1.5-year-old. Other aids were similarly tuned to an aggravating level of intrusiveness. On one hand, these issues can be solved by turning off these features; on the other hand, it’s not much of an active-safety feature if it compels owners to turn it off to escape its annoying habits.\n\nHow Good Is the Volvo EX30’s Interior and Technology?\n\nThis is very much a love-it-or-hate-it situation, and I came down on the hate-it side. The EX30’s cabin is meant to be extremely minimal, with nice materials but not a square inch of leather in sight. The result is an interior I’ve never seen before, with upscale fabric and a single 12.3-inch display serving double duty as both touchscreen and instrument panel. Borrowing from Tesla, nearly every vehicle control is centralized in this display, which is capable of over-the-air updates. Unlike Tesla, the EX30 uses Google Built-In technology rather than bespoke infotainment software, and it includes wireless Apple CarPlay.\n\nI don’t mind the minimalism, but the interior’s practicality is nearly absent. For some reason, Volvo gave the EX30 just two switches to raise and lower all four windows, so I always had to take my eye off the road briefly to make sure I was rolling down the desired window. Some of the central screen’s numerous choices are buried within multiple layers of menus. Just changing the drive mode took me several “button” presses on the screen. Volvo also borrows from Tesla’s playbook for actions like side mirror adjustments; rather than simple, dedicated controls on or near the driver’s door, you must select the function in the touchscreen, then use the steering-wheel buttons to adjust the mirrors’ positions.\n\nThe EX30’s backseat is also frustratingly cramped. My wife and I barely had room to install a rear-facing child safety seat; to get it in place, the front passenger seat had to be shifted so far forward, my 5-foot-8-inch wife didn’t have enough legroom to fit in the front seat — and she barely fit in the backseat behind my driving position. The backseat is cramped for adults in every direction but up; headroom, at least, is decent.\n\nRather than a sunroof, a moonroof or even an opaque roof, the EX30 uses a panoramic piece of glass with no standard shade or electrochromic darkening and lightening feature. The glass roof makes the cabin feel slightly airier, but with no shade the interior just bakes in the summer heat (a removable accessory sunshade costs $200). Maybe that’s a feature that works better in Sweden than in the U.S.?\n\nMore Volvo News From Cars.com:\n\nOne Small EV for the US, One Giant Leap in Price: 2025 Volvo EX30 Now Starts at $46,195\nVolvo Announces Tech Updates for Full 2026 Lineup\nHow Much Is the 2025 Volvo EX40?\n2025 Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid Review: Luxury With a Plug\nPolestar and Volvo EV Drivers Can Now Use Tesla Superchargers\nShould You Buy a 2025 Volvo EX30 Twin-Motor Performance?\n\nOn the grounds of both practicality and price, there are better alternatives to the EX30. A host of compact EV SUVs — the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ and VW ID.4, just to name a few — offer trim levels with more range and more interior space for lower prices. (The more affordable, rear-wheel-drive single-motor EX30 will change this calculation if it ever goes on sale in the U.S.) If you’re considering the EX30 as a secondary commuter car, there are cheaper alternatives to fill that role, like the redesigned 2026 Nissan Leaf.\n\nThe EX30 will be much more of an aesthetic or emotional choice for buyers, with good-looking, futuristic exterior styling, a minimalist Scandinavian interior that will absolutely appeal to some shoppers, and all that power. There may be more sensible options, but the heart wants what the heart wants.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe EX30, EX40 and EX90 all-electric SUVs get updates for the 2026 model year.\nSingle Motor versions of the EX30 and EX90 are now available, as well as the EX30’s new Cross Country variant.\nA Black Edition Package is now optional for the EX40.\n\nWith the federal EV tax credit having expired, the future of the EV market in the U.S. is mired in uncertainty. Nevertheless, Volvo is forging ahead with myriad updates to its electric lineup for the 2026 model year with updates big and small for all three of its electric SUVs: the three-row EX90, small EX40 and smaller EX30.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volvo EX30 Review: Minimalist Interior, Maximum Power\n\nBiggest Changes for Largest EV\n\nWe already knew about the EX90’s new 800-volt electrical architecture, which will allow for faster charging, greater efficiency and more power (up to 670 horsepower in the Twin Motor Performance, making it what Volvo claims is the most powerful car it’s ever offered). Now, the brand has announced it will bring a rear-wheel-drive EX90 Single Motor version to market.\n\nThe company hasn’t shared further details on the variant yet, but if it applies the same strategy to the Single Motor as it previously did to the Twin Motor and Twin Motor Performance versions, the rear-drive EX90 will be available in both the Plus and Ultra trim levels, allowing buyers to separately choose their powertrain and the package of luxury and tech features in their electric Volvo SUV. The Single Motor should be a bit cheaper than the Twin Motor, too, which could allow buyers to get a top-spec Single Motor for a price similar to — or less than — that of an entry-level Twin Motor.\n\nTwo New EX30s\n\nSimilarly, the subcompact EX30 gains a new Single Motor variant for 2026 — and we do know the pricing for this one. It starts at $38,950 (including the destination charge), $6,000 less than the Twin Motor. The RWD Single Motor generates 268 hp versus 422 hp for the Twin Motor Performance, previously the only EX30 powertrain available. Its EPA-rated 261 miles of range only tops that of the Twin by 8 miles, but cargo capacity swells from 12.4 to 27.8 cubic feet, per Volvo’s measurements.\n\nAt the other end of the EX30 lineup is the new Cross Country model. Applying the same philosophy as Volvo’s gas-burning V60 and V90 Cross Country wagons, the EX30 version gets higher ground clearance and black lower-body cladding and extended wheel arches. It’s also distinguished from other EX30s by a panel on the front bumper that’s etched with a topographical map of northern Sweden’s Kebnekaise mountain range. Only available with the Twin Motor Ultra trim, it costs $49,445.\n\nRead More Volvo EV News Coverage on Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2025 Volvo EX90 a Good Electric SUV? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Volvo EX90?\nVolvo ES90: An All-Electric Sedan With Up to 670 HP\nHow Much Is the 2025 Volvo EX40?\nPolestar and Volvo EV Drivers Can Now Use Tesla Superchargers\nA Little Something for the EX40\n\nNot to be left out, the EX40 gains a new Black Edition Package for 2026. Other Volvos have been available in Black Edition form, but the EX40 is the first time it’s been offered on a pure EV. As on those vehicles, the EX40 Black Edition sports black wheels, exterior trim and badging. It’s limited to the Onyx Black, Crystal White, Vapour Grey and Denim Blue exterior colors.\n\nIn the absence of federal incentives to hit its electrification target, Volvo will have to rely on broadening the appeal of its electric lineup. These look like solid first steps.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
