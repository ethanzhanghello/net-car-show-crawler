      "expert_review": "Volvo’s electrification strategy is particularly interesting. In some cases, you have full electric models, like the new 2021 XC40 Recharge. In other cases, you have hybridized models, all of which exist at the top of the regular model range, like the 2021 S90 Recharge T8 or this 2021 XC90 Recharge T8 (both plug-in hybrid models and previously known only as T8s). And if you want something related but just a little different, Volvo’s Chinese parent company, Zhejiang Geely, has started up an entirely new brand called Polestar, which sells pure electric vehicles based on shared platforms and components from Volvo models. \n\nRelated: Volvo Amps Up 2020 XC90 With Mild-Hybrid Version\n\n2021 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nThe Ride\n\nThe plug-in hybrids like the XC90 I tested use a combination of gasoline and stored electricity to power the vehicle, enabling a mix of internal combustion and electric-motor systems or allowing for a full electric experience up to a limited speed and range. They feature a driver-selectable Pure setting that keeps the SUV in electric mode, even if you have the climate control running, with the idea of allowing you to commute to work in electric mode and then charge the battery overnight at home. It’s meant to offer the best of both worlds: pure EV power for your commute, but still retaining the gasoline engine in case your needs extend beyond commuting. As long as you keep filling the vehicle with gas, you can keep driving indefinitely, something that’s not as easy to do with a pure EV, which requires a longer recharge time with more limited range.\n\nThe 2021 XC90 Recharge T8 uses Volvo’s “Twin Engine” powertrain, a supercharged-and-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It’s augmented by an 87-horsepower electric motor to generate a combined 400 hp and 472 pounds-feet of torque, making it the most powerful version of the XC90 you can buy. It’s also EPA-rated to go 18 miles on electricity alone before the gas engine kicks in, allowing you to go up to 520 miles before needing to put more gas in the tank. For 2020, Volvo updated this powertrain to include a kinetic energy-recovery braking system with brake-by-wire technology, which it says reduces fuel consumption and emissions. I wanted to see just how far this comfortable SUV, which can be outfitted to seat up to seven passengers, could go on just its battery power alone before the gas engine kicked in. \n\n2021 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nThe Route\n\nTesting a plug-in hybrid in winter presents some challenges. My route doesn’t change: It’s a simple run from my driveway in Ann Arbor, Mich., to a barbecue restaurant in Dearborn, Mich., and back. The combination of city streets and higher-speed boulevards is a good mix of conditions to see just how far the vehicle can go on electric power alone. I keep the climate control off, since using it with air conditioning can drop range by a couple of miles, or in the winter it usually either activates the gas engine to generate heat or uses an electric heater that can sap range just as much as air conditioning. The windows are up, tires adjusted for proper pressure, and gas tank and battery both full. My driving style is calm and relaxed: Despite selecting the Pure mode to keep the XC90 Recharge in electric driving mode, too much accelerator pedal will punt you into gasoline mode because it uses the engine to help deliver more thrust than the electric motor can provide on its own.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe Volvo XC90 Recharge is rated to go 18 miles on electricity, but my testing turned in a total distance traveled of 20.8 miles before the gas engine kicked in — slightly more than advertised. This isn’t uncommon; I’ve found most plug-in hybrids can outperform their EPA-rated range when driven carefully. Recharging the XC90 Recharge can be done via the Level 2 plug in the front fender or by activating a mode in the touchscreen that runs the gasoline engine to recharge the battery over time. It’s not the most efficient way to recharge the battery (that would be plugging into an outlet), but if you need to recharge the battery on the way to a zero-emissions zone so you can enter it on EV power alone, the XC90 will let you. Admittedly, this is a much more common condition in European cities that have congestion charges for their inner-city regions, but such zones have been discussed for American cities as well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe Volvo XC90 is a mid-size, three-row luxury SUV with seating for six or seven with dual captain’s chairs or a second-row bench. The base engine is a 247-horsepower, turbocharged mild-hybrid 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive; an available upgraded version of this engine delivers 295 hp. At the top of the lineup, the XC90 Recharge plug-in hybrid has 455 hp courtesy of its gas-electric powertrain; that one is the quickest XC90 of the bunch, and it delivers an EPA-estimated 33 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC90’s competitors include the BMW X5, Cadillac XT6, Lexus RX, Lincoln Aviator and Mercedes-Benz GLE.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nThe XC90 is carried over for 2024 with minor tweaks to its standard and available equipment. The line-topping Ultimate trim level gets laminated side windows for improved cabin quietness, as well as a newly available 22-inch wheel design. Volvo is slated to introduce the all-electric EX90 three-row SUV late in the 2024 calendar year as a 2025 model. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo XC90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nTwo USB ports\nQuad-zone climate control\nSeven seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRoad-sign recognition\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated second-row seats\nMassaging front seats\nAir suspension system\nWool upholstery\nHands-free park assist\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo XC90?\n\nComfortable to drive, relatively good on gas and boasting an elegantly detailed cabin, the XC90 is a solid pick among three-row luxury SUVs. Yes, the third-row seats are best left to kids, but that’s true of a number of the XC90’s rivals, too. True to Volvo tradition, the XC90 has a strong track record for safety, and it performs well in crash tests. The plug-in-hybrid XC90 Recharge has the added bonuses of electric-only driving range and a serious horsepower infusion, but it costs considerably more than an XC90 with a mild-hybrid powertrain.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With a longer electric-only range and more power, the updated XC90 Recharge is a considerably better electrified three-row SUV than the previous model.\n\nVersus the competition: There aren’t many plug-in hybrid three-row SUVs with the range of the XC90 right now, but that might be a short-lived circumstance given how quickly new entries are rolling out.\n\nThe Volvo XC90 has been a favorite of the Cars.com Editorial team since we named it our Best Car of 2016 and bought one to test for a year, putting 20,000-plus miles on the SUV that legitimized Volvo as a modern luxury brand. While the 2023 XC90 looks similar to the 2016 model inside and out, the Recharge plug-in hybrid version received a significant midyear update for 2022 that included doubling its EPA-rated electric-only range — it’s up to 36 miles now — and boosting power to 455 horsepower combined. As a PHEV, the XC90 Recharge can drive solely on electric power for short distances, then use the combined power of the electric motor and gasoline engine for maximum acceleration and driving range. With a full charge, the combined gasoline and electric driving range is 530 miles.\n\nRelated: Volvo Pumps the Brakes on Gas Engines, Electrifies All 2023 Models\n\nFor this review, I drove a top-level XC90 Recharge AWD Ultimate equipped with a few extra options, pricing out at $85,495 (with destination). I was most interested in observing how the new plug-in powertrain works, as the SUV’s interior space and quality is virtually unchanged from other XC90s we’ve reviewed over the years.\n\nTwo things stood out. First, the 2023 XC90 feels nearly as modern and luxurious as it did back in 2016, which is impressive. Second, I was surprised by just how much the XC90 Recharge drives like an electric-only vehicle when in electric-only mode. That’s notable because at this price range, there’s not much else (as of April 2023) to get excited about in the electrified three-row SUV space. That said, not everything about the XC90 Recharge checks out as well as its driving behavior.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWhat’s Changed for 2023?\n\nNot much has changed for 2023. The 2022 XC90 Recharge received a major midyear overhaul that included the addition of a larger-capacity hybrid battery (18.8 kilowatt-hours versus 11.6 kWh) good for longer electric-only range, as well as a more powerful electric drive motor that delivers faster acceleration (143 hp versus the previous 87-hp motor). Overall power jumped considerably, from 400 to 455 hp. The refreshed 2022 XC90 Recharge was sold as a 2022 model alongside the previous version, so look for an “extended range” callout if you’re looking for an upgraded 2022 XC90. All 2023 Recharges are the improved version.\n\nWith its new parts, the late-2022 XC90 Recharge’s EPA-rated electric-only range jumped from 18 miles to 36 miles. The 2023 is rated at 33 miles because standard wheel size increased for this model year, up from 19-inch wheels to 20-inchers. Clearly, upsizing wheels can have a dramatic effect on EV range and efficiency, but it also affects ride quality; our test car wore 21-inch wheels, and large impacts were felt and heard in the cabin even with the optional four-corner air suspension.\n\nElectric Range and Driving\n\nMy observed electric-only range with the 21-inch wheels landed between 25 and 28 miles in a mix of city, highway and spirited driving. That’s respectable considering ambient temperatures were between 30 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit and cold decreases electric driving range. With more favorable conditions — i.e., warmer weather or not being driven so spiritedly for evaluation — I imagine its electric-only driving range would be longer. Almost 30 miles of electric range was enough for one or two around-town errands — and it’s commendable, too, considering I wasn’t driving efficiently or trying to elongate the range by turning off cabin heat.\n\nThe XC90 Recharge’s electric-only driving experience can make you forget you’re driving a hybrid SUV. It doesn’t have hallmark EV acceleration, but you won’t have to call upon the gasoline engine for most driving like you do in some PHEVs, nor will the gasoline engine fire up when it’s not called for and spoil the electric experience, as happens in some nonluxury PHEVs (like the Ford Escape and Hyundai Tucson). I had no problem keeping the XC90 Recharge in electric-only mode in the flat lands of the Chicago suburbs so long as I didn’t push the accelerator past a notch at the bottom of the pedal that triggers the gasoline engine to assist. There really wasn’t any need to do so: There’s plenty of juice to get the job done without gasoline.\n\nAnother surprise was the XC90 Recharge’s one-pedal driving mode, a feature that’s rare in hybrids like the XC90 Recharge but common in full battery-electric vehicles. I prefer one-pedal driving because I can drive more smoothly using the accelerator pedal as the go-and-stop pedal (meaning you press the pedal to accelerate then gently ease off it to slow). Easing off the pedal engages aggressive regenerative braking that slows the vehicle and adds energy to the hybrid battery at the same time. In some EVs, this is the most efficient way to drive.\n\nIn the XC90 Recharge, one-pedal driving is engaged by accessing the settings menu in the center touchscreen, going to the Driving menu, then activating One Pedal Drive. One-pedal driving is especially welcome in the XC90 because the actual brake pedal lacks smoothness in its operation.\n\n2023 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nCharging\n\nBoth a positive and a negative of a PHEV is its short electric-only driving range: There’s not much range compared with a full EV, but it charges quickly when the battery is depleted. That means you might not need an expensive home charging circuit or special equipment to charge overnight. On a Level 1 household outlet, the XC90 Recharge can charge in 10 hours at 16 amperes or 14 hours at 10 amps. Most U.S. household outlets will fall between those estimates, with 10 or 12 amperes of available current on a 15- or 20-amp circuit when the circuit is shared with other devices.\n\n2023 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nFor those who drive more than 20-30 miles per day and want to replenish range more quickly — or those who already have Level 2 (240-volt) charging at home — the XC90 Recharge’s relatively slow Level 2 charging capability doesn’t look as good as less expensive PHEVs that charge faster. In my Level 2 home charging test, it took 5 hours, 15 minutes to fully charge the XC90 Recharge’s battery, with a maximum observed charging power of 3.7 kilowatts. More affordable PHEVs charge similarly sized batteries faster. I’ve seen a Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe replenish its battery with 26 miles of rated range in 2 hours, 36 minutes, at a maximum observed 7.5 kW. A Toyota RAV4 Prime needed 2 hours, 35 minutes to fully charge, adding 41 miles at a maximum 5.6 kW.\n\nThe 6 miles of range the XC90 Recharge added per hour doesn’t give it much opportunity to charge during the day between errands; I found myself disconnecting the car from the charger before any meaningful range was added. If you’re interested in learning more about Level 2 home charging and what it takes to install in your home, read our primer on how to determine which EV charger to buy, then see how much it cost us to install six home EV chargers.\n\nElectric Schmelectric: Enjoy 455 HP\n\nWhen you abandon electric-only driving, the XC90 Recharge is quite entertaining. Its combined 455 hp using gasoline and electricity propels this three-row SUV from 0-60 mph in a very brisk 5 seconds, according to Volvo; that’s notably quicker than the XC90 B6’s 6.4 seconds and the B5’s 7.3 seconds. The XC90 has never been a performance SUV, but the Recharge challenges that notion with a rush of acceleration when the pedal hits the floorboard. Even better, the Recharge’s propulsion is accompanied by a far less grainy-sounding engine than we heard in our long-term 2016 XC90 T6 Inscription with its supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter engine. The 2023 Recharge’s engine is only turbocharged, and it’s aided by a boost of electrons.\n\nUsing just the gas engine, the 2023 XC90 Recharge is rated 27 mpg combined, which puts it at the top of the heap among all XC90 configurations.\n\n2023 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nXC90 Recharge Pricing and Value\n\nMy top-trim test car’s $85,000 retail price included options like a $3,200 sound system and $1,800 air suspension. The XC90 Recharge starts at $72,995 (including $1,095 destination) for the Core trim level. It isn’t eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, but state and local incentives may be available.\n\n2023 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nLike the 2016 XC90, you get a respectable and contemporary experience in the 2023 version as far as interior quality, materials and performance go. The XC90 is on the smaller size of its class, though, in terms of third-row passenger space and cargo room behind the third row. Cargo space behind the second row is very good, however; it’s comparable to an Infiniti QX60 or Toyota Highlander.\n\nThere’s also one area that’s due for improvement: the 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen. The 9-inch touchscreen we once lauded now feels small versus the larger screens available in competitors, which put much more useful information in easier-to-interact-with menus and displays. Another ding: The screen uses Google Built-In with integrated Google Maps, and during my test drive, it didn’t work as seamlessly or smoothly as just mirroring Google Maps from my phone in Apple CarPlay. This doesn’t appear to be a Volvo-specific problem, though, as other vehicles with Google Built-In operate similarly.\n\n2023 Volvo XC90 Recharge | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe 2023 XC90 Recharge’s 33 miles of EPA-rated driving range is near the top of the heap when it comes to luxury two- and three-row PHEV competitors, such as the 2023 BMW X5 xDrive45e (31 miles) or 2023 Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring (21 miles). New PHEV versions of the 2024 BMW X5 xDrive45e (39 miles) and Land Rover Range Rover Sport P440e (48 miles) will give the XC90 a run for its money as far as range.\n\nRight now, the XC90 Recharge is one of the better-executed three-row SUVs with a plug, though that may be a short-lived condition considering how quickly new electrified models are entering the space. For those wanting more EV range in the Volvo family, there’s an all-electric three-row Volvo on the horizon: The Volvo EX90, with an estimated 300 miles of electric range, is due in early 2024. Until then, the XC90 Recharge does a surprisingly good job driving like an EV.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Volvo XC60 Recharge Gets Powertrain Upgrade, All-Electric Range of 35 Miles\n2024 Volvo EX90: 3-Row EV Packs New Tech, 300-Mile Range\n2021 Volvo XC90 Recharge Range: Here’s How Far We Went on Electricity Alone\nTop 10 Most Efficient Electric Cars\nElectric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
