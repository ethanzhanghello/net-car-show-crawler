      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW i3, Lexus NX 300h, Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y (eventually)\n\nLooks like: An XC40 with a plastic cover where the grille should be\n\nDrivetrains: Dual-motor, battery-electric all-wheel drive powertrain producing a claimed 402 horsepower (408 outside of the U.S.) and 487 pounds-feet of torque; range is “over 400 kilometers” based on European testing and Volvo predicts roughly 200 miles of range in the U.S.\n\nHits dealerships: 2020\n\nVolvo revealed its all-electric XC40 Recharge today — the Swedish automaker’s first all-electric vehicle — as part of a push toward a more sustainable future, and it seems like a solid, if cautious, first step.\n\nRelated: Volvo’s Getting All Charged Up About Electric XC40\n\nBeginning with the XC40 Recharge, Volvo plans on launching an all-electric vehicle every year as part of making all-electric cars half of its sales by 2025 and becoming a climate-neutral company by 2040. Volvo chief Hakan Samuelsson said Volvo’s plan was to make sustainability as synonymous with the Volvo brand as safety currently is.\n\nStarting with the XC40 and not making the XC40 Recharge a radical visual departure from the much-lauded small SUV is a good plan, and getting in ahead of the anticipated Tesla Model Y small SUV will also help bolster the XC40 Recharge’s position as the tip of Volvo’s Recharge lineup plans: Beginning in early 2020, shoppers will be asked at the “entrance” to Volvo’s consumer site if they want a car “with a cord” — the XC40 Recharge and the plug-in hybrid versions of Volvo’s other vehicles — or without one.\n\nExterior\n\nThe XC40 Recharge doesn’t look much different from its internal combustion sibling. The most significant visual clue that it’s electric is the replacement of the open grille options — blacked-out plastic or vertical metal slats — with a solid panel wearing the Volvo badge. A more subtle change will be the embossed “Recharge” on the C-pillar in the same location as the regular XC40’s trim level.\n\n2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge | Manufacturer image\nInterior\n\nThere are also few changes to the interior from a visual standpoint. The biggest difference will be the XC40 Recharge’s new infotainment system, powered by Android; it will allow for over-the-air updates and fully integrate Google apps like Maps and Assistant. The over-the-air update plan is part of Volvo’s push for sustainability; the hope is that a constantly updated multimedia system keeps the XC40 Recharge feeling modern and makes it less likely for buyers to want or feel the need for a new vehicle.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nA frunk! Get it!? Because there’s no combustion engine anymore!? So now it’s just storage!? C’mon, “frunk” is a funny word. Anyway …\n\nPower is generated from a 78 kilowatt-hour battery pack that powers two electric motors, one front and one rear, driving all four wheels. Total system output for the XC40 Recharge will be 402 horsepower and 487 pounds-feet of torque. Volvo claims the XC40 Recharge will go from zero-to-62 mph in 4.9 seconds.\n\nA full charge should net what Volvo says is 200 miles of driving range. The automaker also says that with DC fast charging, the battery can reach an 80 percent charge in 40 minutes.\n\nSafety\n\nSafety has always been a priority for Volvo vehicles, and the XC40 Recharge is no different. With the removal of the internal combustion engine from the front, Volvo significantly reinforced the vehicle’s frame to mitigate the effects of a frontal collision. The rear motor is also integrated into the body structure to improve crash safety. The battery pack gets a special “cage” to protect the batteries in case of impact while also working to help protect occupants. Volvo also points out that the low and central location of the battery pack lowers the XC40 Recharge’s center of gravity and reduces the risk of rollovers.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge comes equipped with a what Volvo calls a “scalable” active-safety system. The Advanced Driver Assistance System uses cameras, sensors and radar and can be updated as software and technologies improve — similar to Teslas. According to Volvo, it “lays the foundation for the future introduction of autonomous drive technology.”\n\nThe ability to update and improve some of the safety features of the XC40 Recharge works hand in hand with the infotainment system’s over-the-air updates to encourage owners to hold on to their cars longer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Volvo’s XC40 Recharge is a quick little electric SUV with few tricks of its own, but it preserves the endearing qualities of the well-rounded gas-powered model on which it’s based.\n\nVersus the competition: The XC40 is among the quicker EVs on the market at large, and it rides better than many affordable competitors, but modest underlying efficiency compromises its range and charging speed.\n\nThe Volvo XC40 is a Cars.com favorite among subcompact luxury SUVs, so we welcomed the news that it would become the brand’s first fully electric vehicle in 2021 after several years of plug-in hybrids across the lineup. Small SUVs are the heart of the U.S. market, and when it comes to EVs, you can’t limit the brands you consider buying to just luxury ones — or even premium or modest mass-market automakers. The lines here are blurred.\n\nRelated: 2021 Volvo XC60 Recharge Review\n\nSpeaking of blurred lines, the XC40 Recharge we tested was technically a 2021 model … but was it? Like a growing number of new vehicles, the XC40 Recharge can be updated wirelessly in ways that fundamentally change it. Our test vehicle — which was built for the EV’s inaugural model year (2021) and even badged with its original drivetrain designation, “P8 AWD” — received such an update before our evaluation. I’ll explain the resulting changes later, but suffice to say that in all the ways that matter for a review, the model we drove had essentially been turned into a XC40 Recharge Twin, which is what the 2022 version has been named. The same will be true of any other 2021 models already in the hands of early buyers.\n\nLike everyone else, we’ve been trumpeting the coming flood of battery-electric vehicles, but everything’s relative. There still aren’t that many, and once you break them into their respective types — their claimed body styles and the ones your eyes clearly see — you end up with only a few models from which to choose. As we’ve bemoaned, all EVs seem to have one or two fundamental flaws: In brief, the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV are under recall; the Ford Mustang Mach-E doesn’t ride well; the Volkswagen ID.4 is plagued by an overabundance of touch-sensitive controls; and the Tesla Model Y rides too firmly for some roads, has no instrument panel and is no longer eligible for a federal tax credit. (Its price also seems to increase every time you check it.) At the end of the day, if you want an EV, you still have to pick your poison. (We don’t yet have enough experience with the 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6 to comment on them.)\n\nIf it seems like these models aren’t direct competitors for the XC40 Recharge, you’re catching on to how limited EV choices are. But know that, with the exception of the bargain-priced VW, all of them have versions whose MSRPs overlap even if you don’t consider the brands themselves comparable to Volvo’s luxury reputation. In the EV world, everything’s different.\n\nOstensibly, all four of the models we’ve reviewed are SUVs, but the Mach-E gets criticized most for that designation thanks to its 5.7-inch ground clearance and the fact that it doesn’t look like an SUV (which could be a plus or a minus, depending on your perspective). The XC40 Recharge boasts a relatively generous 6.9 inches of ground clearance even though its low-slung battery pack lowers that number versus the gas-powered XC40’s 8.3 inches.\n\nTechnically a subcompact SUV, the XC40 seems relatively small, but according to Cars.com’s own accounting of the cargo space behind these EVs’ backseats (including the five-seat Model Y, which can be had with an optional third row), the models mentioned above are all pretty close in this regard. The XC40 has 17.7 cubic feet of space, plus another 0.5 cubic foot in its front trunk. That puts it close to the VW ID.4, which has 18.9 cubic feet and lacks a frunk. Combining hatches and frunks, the Mach-E has 17.9 cubic feet and the Model Y leads the pack with 23.8 cubic feet.\n\nAs for how the Recharge compares to the regular XC40, which we reviewed in detail when it debuted, its towing capacity is 2,000 pounds rather than 3,500. (For the record, we didn’t tow with this vehicle and have broader reservations about what towing does to any EV’s range.) Otherwise, Volvo’s specifications suggest the Recharge is identical inside, which is how it felt to us — apart from a few items I’ll address below.\n\nIt Drives Damn Well\n\nThe XC40 Recharge stood out immediately because it rides reasonably well without any high-tech (and high-cost) adaptive shock absorbers. That can’t be said about most affordable EVs; whether it’s the nature of the vehicle type or their manufacturers’ attempts to make them feel sporty, we’ve found the ride quality of many EVs to be ill-suited to the roads around Cars.com’s Chicago offices. The ID.4 is a notable exception, as was the Polestar 2 we tested. To be fair, this relative of the XC40 is more solidly a car than an SUV, had manually adjustable shock absorbers and cost $67,550 as tested. (No longer a launch edition, the Polestar 2’s MSRP is down to $51,200 for 2022 with destination charges but before federal incentives.)\n\nThe XC40 is an unlikely rocket. Compared with today’s gas-powered vehicles, all EVs boast immediate accelerator pedal response, and many of them are quick in a way that surprises unfamiliar drivers. But there are levels here, too, and the XC40 Recharge is on the quicker end of the spectrum, with a manufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds. The Model Y Long Range AWD’s estimate is 4.8 seconds, according to Tesla, while the Performance version is 3.5 seconds. At its “slowest,” the Mach-E hits 60 in roughly 6.1 seconds, while the new GT Performance version does so in a claimed 3.5 seconds. The rear-wheel-drive ID.4 is a tad poky, at a VW-estimated 7.5 seconds to 60 mph, though the AWD version knocks it down to 5.4 seconds.\n\nFor comparison, the quickest gas-powered XC40 hits 60 mph in 6.1 seconds, according to Volvo. The Recharge’s urgent acceleration from its front and rear electric motors, each rated 201 horsepower, combines with decent ride and competent handling to create a responsive and engaging vehicle. Where some EVs’ power diminishes at highway speeds, the XC40’s doesn’t. It even has a proper One Pedal Drive setting that maximizes regenerative braking, meaning you can do most of your braking simply by lifting off the accelerator. (Some competitors don’t go far enough with the regeneration level or levels even though there’s no reason not to offer drivers more choices.)\n\nThe XC40 Recharge does what EVs theoretically do best: mix comfortable, quiet motoring with the opportunity for equally quiet bursts of breathtaking acceleration. The best EVs seem to defy logic by doing so without sacrificing efficiency across the board in the way gas-powered performance vehicles always have. Alas, the XC40 Recharge may not be one of these EVs.\n\nSo What’s the Problem?\n\nThe XC40 Recharge has an efficiency problem. People tend to ignore efficiency in EVs, but it may just matter more here because range is limited and refueling (charging) is slow. The more efficient an EV is, the farther it can drive on a given amount of electricity and the faster its battery will fill. Thus, as with gasoline, the cheaper it will be to operate, as well.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge made its 2021 debut with a very disappointing EPA-estimated efficiency rating of 79 mpg-equivalent in combined city/highway driving, with a 208-mile range estimate. (The mpg-e sounds high versus gasoline, but the spec is useful only when comparing EVs with each other, which we’ll do in a moment.) The over-the-air update mentioned above, version 1.8, has increased the efficiency of all XC40s to an EPA-estimated 85 mpg-e and upped their range to 223 miles.\n\nVolvo isn’t talking explicitly about what it changed, citing energy management, thermal management and software optimization, but it’s fascinating that computer code alone can make this much of a difference — and that the resulting vehicle remained agreeable to drive. But there are limits to how much an automaker can affect efficiency through software alone.\n\nCompare the ’22 XC40 EV to its competitors and you’ll find its mpg-e seems close to the Mach-E GT’s 84 mpg-e, but there are more factors to consider: This rating is for the Mach-E that can get to 60 mph faster than the Volvo (3.8 seconds without the Performance Package) and it has greater range, at 270 miles. The most efficient Mach-E is rated 101 mpg-e combined.\n\nA loaded VW ID.4 is also rated higher than the Volvo, goes farther and costs less. The Tesla Model Y, even in its quickest version (Performance), is rated 111 mpg-e combined and goes 303 miles. (Performance and efficiency aren’t mutually exclusive.) The Long Range version, which Cars.com owns for long-term testing, can go an estimated 330 miles and is rated 122 mpg-e. A rear-wheel-drive Model Y carries a 129 mpg-e combined rating and a 244-mile range.\n\nNote that I led with an efficiency problem, not a range problem, because how much range buyers need will vary greatly, especially given EVs are best charged at home, overnight. More than 200 miles of driving per day is an awful lot. Now, if you’re hoping to take road trips and rely on public charging — and/or the effects of cold temperatures on EV range are a potential issue for you — you might be among the minority of drivers for whom the XC40’s 223 miles of range won’t be enough. (But it bears noting that I write this as temperatures hover around 0 degrees Fahrenheit, which easily cuts any EV’s range in half.)\n\nTo be clear, there are limits to what Volvo can do with computer code, so it’s highly unlikely that an XC40 Recharge purchased today will someday get a software update and magically overtake its competitors in the various specifications above, at least not without some noticeable difference in how it performs. Future versions, however, with different batteries or motors or other hardware? Possibly. Just don’t be misled by the update to version 1.8.\n\nCharging\n\nPerhaps the smartest thing Volvo did with the XC40 Recharge was launch it with robust home-charging capability: 11 kilowatts. An EV itself can be a bottleneck, and more energy is always better. In the XC40 Recharge’s case, those 11 kW help mask its efficiency shortcoming, given the same amount of power fed to a less efficient vehicle will add less range over the same period. (Perhaps Jaguar didn’t see this coming when it launched the I-Pace EV in 2019, combining just 7 kW of charging capability with a dismal 76 mpg-e efficiency. It took 13 hours to charge an empty battery — at best. The 2022 model is going to 11 kW.)\n\nAccording to Volvo, the XC40 Recharge will charge fully within eight hours via a 48-amp 240-volt Level 2 home charger, in 12 hours with a 32-amp charger, and in 24 hours with a 16-amp charger. Note that charging slows as the battery pack fills, so this means you’ll add more than the average of 28 miles of range per hour of charging when the battery is low, less when it’s fuller. With my test vehicle’s battery at 69% full, the instrument panel said it was accepting 46 amps from my 48-amp charger, adding 26 miles per hour. Today, 32-amp Level 2 chargers are still more common, including in public; with one of those, you’d average 18 or 19 miles of range per hour.\n\nLike most manufacturers, Volvo recommends setting the car to stop charging when the battery is 90% full, which is better for long-term battery health; you should charge to 100% only when needed for longer trips. According to Volvo’s online estimator, 90% will be just over 200 miles of range. Plus, considering 90% a full charge will probably shave an hour off your recharge time because the last bit is the slowest.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge can also be charged at public DC fast-charging stations rated 150 kW or higher, going from empty to 80% within 40 minutes, Volvo says. If you happen upon a 50-kW charger, an 80% charge would take two hours.\n\nWith the purchase of an electric XC40, Volvo includes 250 kilowatt-hours of DC fast charging, followed by a one-year subscription to discounted energy at Electrify America stations. Most manufacturers acknowledge that excessive DC charging can diminish an EV battery’s long-term capacity, but what Volvo is offering only translates to about four refills from zero to 80%.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge?\n2022 Volvo C40 Recharge Comes With $60,000 Price Tag, Free Charging\nIs the 2021 Volvo XC60 Recharge a Good Car? 5 Pros and 2 Cons\n2021 Volvo S90 Recharge PHEV Range: How Far Can It Go on Electricity Alone?\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\nTaking Sides: The User Interface\n\nSince it launched, the XC40 has been one of the growing number of vehicles that relies a little too much on its touchscreen for important controls that might be better assigned to a physical button that could be accessed without poking through a menu or two. The One Pedal Drive feature mentioned above, which might be changed often based on driver or mood, is just one example.\n\nWhen I heard Volvo had chosen to switch from its own Sensus touchscreen interface to one driven by Google, I thought it was risky. I’m an Android user myself, but people are very particular about their platforms; it’s almost like saying your dashboard was engineered by the Democratic or Republican national committee. I thought choosing Google would wipe this vehicle off the consideration list of Apple devotees.\n\nWhat I didn’t expect was that I, an Android user, wouldn’t love it myself. It’s fine, but it doesn’t seem to improve much on the previous approach, augmented by Android Auto, in terms of its menus, structure or overall usability, and it adds one strange obstacle: To exploit it fully, you have to log in with a Google account. (I can imagine the Apple people fuming, just as I predicted.) The system doesn’t currently support Apple CarPlay, either, though Volvo says it will be added in early 2022 in an over-the-air update.\n\nI drove a borrowed fleet vehicle and thus wasn’t able to log in, so the result was a less personalized experience than I get from any other vehicle I test with Android Auto. The XC40 doesn’t support Android Auto, the function, because why would it? It is a freakin’ Android auto. This might be more a reviewer/borrower problem (or a process problem) than an owner problem, but the upshot is that both “sides” — Android and Apple users — left the experience disgruntled. In politics, that’s the sign of a good compromise. In this case, I think there’s work to be done.\n\nShould You Buy a Volvo XC40 Recharge?\n\nDespite all the talk, it’s still early days in this latest EV push, and the differences among the options out there are clearer than they are among conventional models. The gas-powered XC40 is a favorite of ours, and the Recharge’s drivability and thrilling acceleration are definite high points. Its relatively modest range might scare off uninitiated shoppers, but those of us who have owned EVs know that 200-plus miles per day is more than enough. However, EV range comes at a cost, and with a starting price of $55,300 plus a $1,095 destination charge (before incentives, which include a federal tax credit of up to $7,500), the XC40 Recharge isn’t cheap. Luxury brands do, however, tend to command a higher price, and its style and SUV-ness are sure to appeal. In the end, the market will decide.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nThe pert-looking XC40 is Volvo’s smallest SUV, though it has the same polished driving manners and refined design found in the automaker’s larger offerings. The 2023 XC40 is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is new for 2023 and available in two forms: a 194-horsepower variant (dubbed B4) and a 247-hp B5 version. Both are coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The B4 powertrain is only available with front-wheel drive, while the B5 gets standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThere’s also an XC40 Recharge Pure Electric variant. Its 402-hp EV powertrain comes standard with AWD and delivers an EPA-estimated driving range of 223 miles. XC40 competitors include the Lexus UX, BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. If you’re shopping for pure-electric rivals, consider the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q4 E-Tron and Jaguar I-Pace.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nIn addition to its new engine, the XC40 gets new trim-level names for 2023: base Core, mid-range Plus, and range-topping Ultimate. A Google-based infotainment system is newly standard, and a modest exterior refresh includes revised headlights, a redesigned front grille and bumper, and new wheel-design choices.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volvo XC40 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nWith its new, more efficient mild-hybrid engine lineup, not to mention the available all-electric Recharge model, the Volvo XC40 is a functional and eco-minded pick among small luxury SUVs. The XC40 has a firm but well-controlled ride that pairs nicely with its accurate handling, and its cabin is spacious and attractive. The base B4 powertrain should be peppy enough for many SUV shoppers, but the stronger B5 engine and its standard AWD are worth the $2,000 upgrade. The Recharge model’s driving range is middling, but its 402-hp AWD powertrain turns the XC40 into a hot rod.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nThe subcompact XC40 is Volvo’s smallest SUV, though it has the same polished driving manners and refined design found in the Swedish brand’s larger offerings. The only gasoline powertrain offered for 2024 is the B5, a mild-hybrid, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s good for 247 horsepower and couples with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel-drive. The B4 powertrain with 194 hp and front-wheel-drive has been discontinued for 2024.\n\nThere’s also an XC40 Recharge Pure Electric variant. A new-for-2024 single-motor Extended Range version has rear-wheel drive and an EPA-estimated 293 miles of range. Its 402-hp electric twin-motor powertrain comes standard with AWD and delivers an EPA-estimated driving range of 254 miles. XC40 competitors include the Lexus UX, BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA. If you’re shopping for pure-electric rivals, consider the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q4 e-Tron and Jaguar I-Pace.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nIn addition to the trim changes noted above, base XC40 Core trims get two new color choices and additional standard features, including wireless device charging and keyless entry, while mid-lineup Plus variants get new 19-inch wheels and a standard surround-view camera. Top Ultimate trims are treated to standard cornering lights, upgraded LED headlights, 20-inch wheels and power rear child-safety locks. \n\nIn addition to the new single-motor RWD version of the XC40 Recharge Pure Electric, the AWD variant’s range estimate jumps from 223 to 254 miles thanks to more efficient electric motors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo XC40 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats \nDual-zone climate control \nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking\nRear cross-traffic alert \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nWith its modern and upscale interior design, efficient mild-hybrid engine and the available all-electric Recharge model, the Volvo XC40 is a functional and eco-minded pick among small luxury SUVs. The XC40 has a firm but well-controlled ride that pairs nicely with its accurate handling, and its cabin is spacious and attractive. The AWD Recharge model’s driving range falls short of many EVs, but its 402-hp powertrain turns the XC40 into a hot rod.",
