      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volvo S90?\n\nThe Volvo S90 mid-size luxury sedan seats five people and competes with the BMW 5 Series and Audi A6. It’s powered by a turbocharged and supercharged mild-hybrid 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 295 horsepower. A plug-in hybrid version cranks out 455 hp and can travel up to 38 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates. All S90s have an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volvo S90?\n\nThe S90 is essentially unchanged for 2025. The top-line Ultimate trim is now called Ultra, and the plug-in hybrid version loses “Recharge” from its name.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volvo S90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n19-inch aluminum wheels\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nGoogle Built-In infotainment system\nAudio system with 10 speakers\nFour-zone climate control\nAutomatic headlights and high beams\nAdaptive self-leveling headlights\nCornering lights\nRain-sensing wipers\nPower moonroof\nPowered and heated side mirrors\nRemote start\nPowered and heated front seats with lumbar adjustment\n60/40-split, folding and heated rear seats\nLeather seating\nRemote keyless entry\nProximity key and push-button start\nWood and aluminum interior trim\nHeated steering wheel\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nPower rear sunshades\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPilot Assist\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear collision mitigation\nFront and rear parking sensors\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated rear seats\nMassaging front seats\n20-inch aluminum wheels\n600-watt Harman Kardon audio system with 14 speakers\n1,410-watt Bowers & Wilkins High Fidelity audio system\nReal-time traffic data\nPower open and close trunk\nHead-up display\nPerforated Nappa leather upholstery\nNavigation\nFour-way power lumbar adjustment in front seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volvo S90?\n\nThe S90 stands out from its rivals by prioritizing elegance over athleticism, and it has more backseat space than the class norm. The lack of a mega-horsepower performance model might turn away some luxury sports sedan shoppers, but the standard engine is respectably potent and the plug-in hybrid model offers both efficiency and power.",
