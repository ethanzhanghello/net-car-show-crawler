      "expert_review": "Volvo’s XC60 is getting an update for the 2026 model year, but you’ll either need to be a fan of the brand or inside the mid-size SUV to notice. Like the larger XC90, the XC60 sports a modernized grille with a cross-hatch insert. New wheel designs and darkened taillights are the extent of the exterior changes.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volvo XC60 Unchanged, Starts at $48,345\n\nInside, however, is a new 11.2-inch touchscreen that overflows the space occupied by its predecessor, standing a couple of inches above the plane of the dashboard. Running Volvo’s next-generation infotainment software, the display features quicker responses and Google Built-In. The brand says the XC60’s fabrics and interior trim materials are new, as well — even the speaker mesh on the available Bowers & Wilkins audio system is tweaked — but the interior design is otherwise unchanged.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nUnder the hood, things remain the same for the 2026 XC60. The base B5 version packs a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 247 horsepower and 266 pounds-feet of torque. T8 badging denotes a plug-in hybrid XC60, which supplements the turbo four’s output with a burly electric motor and an 18.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack for a combined 455 hp and 523 pounds-feet; it gets 36 miles of electric-only range. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard with both powertrains.\n\nThe B5 returns an EPA-estimated 23/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined, and the plug-in T8 is rated at 28 mpg combined with the gas engine pitching in.\n\nWhen Will the 2026 Volvo XC60 Be Available?\n\nThe 2026 Volvo XC60 will be available later this year. Pricing details will be released closer to the start of sales, but the base B5 variant will likely start around $50,000 and the T8 at about $60,000.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Volvo XC60 Recharge?\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nResearch the Volvo XC60\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe Volvo XC60 is a five-seat luxury SUV that’s notable for its comfortable ride, handsome cabin layout and impressive lineup of safety features. A 247-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system is standard; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The XC60 Recharge plug-in hybrid adds two electric motors to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and it’s good for an eye-opening 455 hp and an EPA-estimated 36 miles of electric-only driving range. The XC60’s rivals include the Acura RDX, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe XC60 is largely unchanged for 2025. The top trim is now called Ultra instead of Ultimate, and the plug-in hybrid drops “Recharge” from its name.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volvo XC60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nGoogle-based navigation\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10-speaker audio system\nCloth upholstery\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nSurround-view parking camera\nAdaptive cruise control\nPower liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nHead-up display\n14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system\n15-speaker Bowers & Wilkins audio system\nHeated steering wheel\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volvo XC60?\n\nThe Volvo XC60 remains a great choice for SUV shoppers who value a comfortable ride, a classy interior, and a long lineup of standard and optional active safety features. The ride gets much firmer if you opt for the larger alloy wheels, however, and the price of the plug-in hybrid model gets steep in higher trims.",
