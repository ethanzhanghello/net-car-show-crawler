      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nThe subcompact XC40 is Volvo’s smallest SUV, though it has the same polished driving manners and refined design found in the Swedish brand’s larger offerings. The only gasoline powertrain offered for 2024 is the B5, a mild-hybrid, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s good for 247 horsepower and couples with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel-drive. The B4 powertrain with 194 hp and front-wheel-drive has been discontinued for 2024.\n\nThere’s also an XC40 Recharge Pure Electric variant. A new-for-2024 single-motor Extended Range version has rear-wheel drive and an EPA-estimated 293 miles of range. Its 402-hp electric twin-motor powertrain comes standard with AWD and delivers an EPA-estimated driving range of 254 miles. XC40 competitors include the Lexus UX, BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA. If you’re shopping for pure-electric rivals, consider the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q4 e-Tron and Jaguar I-Pace.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nIn addition to the trim changes noted above, base XC40 Core trims get two new color choices and additional standard features, including wireless device charging and keyless entry, while mid-lineup Plus variants get new 19-inch wheels and a standard surround-view camera. Top Ultimate trims are treated to standard cornering lights, upgraded LED headlights, 20-inch wheels and power rear child-safety locks. \n\nIn addition to the new single-motor RWD version of the XC40 Recharge Pure Electric, the AWD variant’s range estimate jumps from 223 to 254 miles thanks to more efficient electric motors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo XC40 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats \nDual-zone climate control \nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking\nRear cross-traffic alert \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo XC40?\n\nWith its modern and upscale interior design, efficient mild-hybrid engine and the available all-electric Recharge model, the Volvo XC40 is a functional and eco-minded pick among small luxury SUVs. The XC40 has a firm but well-controlled ride that pairs nicely with its accurate handling, and its cabin is spacious and attractive. The AWD Recharge model’s driving range falls short of many EVs, but its 402-hp powertrain turns the XC40 into a hot rod.",

Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Volvo XC40?\n\nNew standard features include full-LED adaptive headlights with automatic high beams, LED foglights and two rear USB-C ports. There’s also a new fully electric Recharge version of the SUV.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Volvo XC40 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\nDigital instrument panel\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2021 Volvo XC40?\n\nThe XC40 is an impressive entry in the subcompact luxury SUV class. The T5’s engine is strong, and the SUV handles well. The interior is quiet and offers good storage space. However, rear visibility is limited, and the rear-seat cushion is low and not that long. We also wish the multimedia system had more physical controls.",

      "expert_review": "Volvo is sticking to its aggressive plans for electrification, intending to sell nothing but electric vehicles by 2030. While the all-electric XC40 Recharge has been renamed the EX40 to fit into Volvo’s EV nomenclature and the gas-powered XC40 is unchanged for the new model year, the latter is far from rotting on the vine and remains a charming, well-rounded small SUV. And for 2025, the XC40’s base price increases just $650, to $41,945 (all prices include $1,295 destination fee).\n\nRelated: Is the 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin a Good SUV? 7 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Volvo XC40 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nCore: $41,945\nPlus: $46,795\nUltra: $50,595\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEven the gas-powered XC40 is electrified, with its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine assisted by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Generating 247 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque, the powertrain is teamed with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. The combo is good for an EPA-rated 23/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety systems for the 2025 XC40 include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and steering assist, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, road-sign recognition, rain-sensing windshield wipers and rear parking sensors. Additional features on the entry-level Core trim include 18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. Inside are cloth upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and dual-zone automatic climate control. In-car tech includes wireless phone charging, eight speakers, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe mid-level Pure adds a 360-degree camera system, front and side parking sensors, a panoramic moonroof and 19-inch wheels. Its cabin is upgraded with leather upholstery and fancier trim, a power-adjustable passenger seat and a crystal shifter knob.\n\nAt the top of the lineup, the Ultra features adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, 20-inch wheels, upgraded headlights and a 13-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Volvo XC40?\n2024 Volvo C40 Recharge, XC40 Recharge Get More Range, New Powertrains\n2019 Volvo XC40 Review: Premium Without Pretense\nResearch the Volvo XC40\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Volvo’s current SUVs, the XC90 and XC60, are elegant, even Zen, with their Scandinavian design, open-pore wood trim and muted colors. Funky, spunky, even cute have not been words that come to mind — until now, with Volvo’s new city-sized SUV, the 2019 Volvo XC40, aimed at bringing in more urban and younger buyers. The Volvo XC40 takes on such established compact rivals as the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class.\n\nRelated: 2019 Volvo XC40 Makes Ingenious Use of Its Small Space\n\nThe Volvo XC40 is the big SUVs’ fun younger cousin. Not that it’s a lightweight (except in actual weight): The XC40 packs most of the brainpower — multimedia, safety and driver aid tech — of the XC60 and three-row XC90, Cars.com’s Best of 2016 winner. It just offers it in a tidier package almost a foot shorter and about $6,000 cheaper than a comparable XC60.\n\nAt a Volvo media preview in the Texas Hill Country, I drove the two Volvo XC40 models that will be available first, the T5 Momentum and sportier T5 R-Design, and found they pack a lot of standard features into an SUV that’s both stylish and fun to drive. More and less expensive versions will be available after the initial launch. (Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events.)\n\n2019 Volvo XC40 | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe launch models, which will be at dealers “in a few weeks,” says Volvo, are pricier trim levels with all-wheel drive and an upgraded 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Momentum starts at $36,195 with destination; the R-Design at $38,695. Both all-wheel drive test cars were loaded with options; the Momentum I drove totaled $44,315, while the R-Design sticker was $45,935.\n\nMore flavors of the Volvo XC40 will follow. An XC40 T4 base model with front-wheel drive and a 187-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder joins the lineup this summer, starting at $34,195, which is on target with the base models of rival small luxury SUVs.  Also coming is a fancier XC40 Inscription flagship, like the XC60 and XC90, and — down the road, Volvo says — full-electric versions and a hybrid using a recently unveiled new 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine.\n\nPremium, But Not Pretentious\n\nThe XC40 has a family resemblance to Volvo’s bigger SUVs, particularly in the taillights and front “Thor’s Hammer” LED daytime running lights. Plus, its upright profile says SUV and not dressed-up hatchback like some competitors.\n\nBut it riffs on this theme with youthful attitude: its own concave grille, big upswept back pillars and a “floating” roof offered in contrasting black or white. There’s even a version with a white roof, white mirror caps and white wheels. It’s a fresh design that Volvo says drew on sources as diverse as street fashion and designer goods, urban architecture and pop culture. By comparison, it makes many luxury rivals look a little dated, stuffy or both.\n\nInside, nature-inspired Scandinavian design of recent new Volvos, with muted colors and open-pore wood trim, gives way to design that’s still Scandinavian but less serene, with patterned metal trim and some color choices that you’d see more at Ikea than in nature, such as red leather or 1970s-retro Lava Orange door panels and footwells. Yes, there is more plastic below your elbow than in more expensive Volvos — as you would expect — but not in the creative design and materials for places you look at and touch most. That ranges from the standard leather seating in all XC40s to the original and eco-friendly feltlike material lining the door panels that’s made from 97 percent recycled water bottles.\n\nThe front seats were comfortable and supportive for a long drive, as you would expect from a company known for its seats. The backseat is less satisfying, offering sufficient space for adults if you compromise a little with the front seat occupants’ position. The base cushion is too low and short for good thigh support and a non-reclining seatback is uncomfortably vertical. It’s better back there for short drives.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe test vehicles’ 248 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque, which comes full-on early and stays late, provides plenty of scoot in town and on the highway, with next to no turbo lag. It’s a version of the base engine in Volvo’s bigger, heavier SUVs, but it really shines in this smaller package. Fuel-economy ratings are not yet available, but premium fuel is recommended.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic’s shifts are positive, though not always silky smooth, but that’s forgiven for the way it willingly downshifts to tap more power. The XC40 has selectable drive modes that provide modestly different throttle, steering and transmission response. Coming this summer is an adaptive suspension option with adjustable-firmness ride quality that will add to that variation.\n\nMy only real nit with the powertrain is that it drives better than it sounds. When pushed, the engine is a little buzzy. The cabin is well-insulated from road noise, which made it seem even more intrusive. And the start-stop system also is a little rough in its stops and restarts.\n\nThe XC40 is the first Volvo on the company’s new Compact Modular Architecture, a different platform than the one that underpins the XC60 and XC90, and has its own suspension design, making it more a cousin than a sibling to them, says Volvo. The XC40 uses struts in the front and a multilink and coil suspension in the rear. The R-Design gives the setup a sportier tuning, but both models were firm without being harsh and relatively flat in cornering.\n\nAs a front-drive design with the weight concentrated forward, the XC40 understeers when pushed. The steering was responsive but light (less so in Sport mode). A bit more weight and feedback would allow the driver to feel more confident in the corners.\n\nBut these criticisms are at the margins, particularly for an SUV. Overall, the XC40 is fun to drive and notably more so than some of its small SUV peers.\n\nPutting the Utility in SUV\n\nA key way Volvo is trying to set the XC40 apart from rivals, most of which have limited cabin storage, is with one of the most practical interiors this side of a minivan. The idea is to help organize the clutter of life in the car.\n\nMost striking are the panels with carve-outs reclaiming space from inside the door. The big bins that run the length of the front doors were made possible by new-design subwoofers behind the dash just below the windshield that eliminated the need for lower-door speakers. Other details include a removable trash receptacle ahead of the console storage bin to catch the odd small trash and wrappers that end up in the cupholders. A “phablet”-sized device bin at the front of the console has media and power ports and an available wireless charging pad for the supersized class of new phones that approach tablet-sized. There are card holders in the dash to the left of the driver and out of sight above the device bin. The glove box cover has a flip-out hook on which to hang your takeout bag or purse. And there is more storage space under both front seats.\n\n2019 Volvo XC40 | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nThe cargo area in the XC40 includes more than 20.7 cubic feet behind the backseat (including an underfloor bin), which is a lot for this class. The cargo floor can be folded to stand up as a divider (including bag hooks) to sort and restrain smaller cargo. And in a detail that should be a federal rule for SUVs, the cargo cover stores on board under the floor when you need it out of the way.\n\nFull-Size Technology and Safety\n\nWhile the XC40 is a smaller vehicle with a smaller price, the safety and multimedia technology have not been downsized. The XC40 comes standard with Volvo’s City Safety system that includes a low-speed front collision warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian, bicycle and large animal detection. Volvo’s Pilot Assist system, with a sophisticated adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, is available, as is a rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking and a 360-degree camera.\n\nThe XC40 also has a 12.3-inch screen for the standard configurable instrument display. And dominating the center of the dashboard is the same 9-inch vertical multimedia display as in the XC60 that handles almost all of the climate and audio controls. It’s just as sharp and colorful — and just as distracting to use on the move. The steps required for common functions sometimes took my eyes off the road more than I’d like. Thankfully, there is a volume knob, but a few more physical controls would go a long way here.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard, a Wi-Fi hot spot is available, and the XC40 comes with a four-year subscription to Volvo’s connected car and emergency services.\n\nBuy, Lease or Just Hang Out With It\n\nVolvo is offering a sort of “friends with benefits” way to get into an XC40 without the more serious commitment of buying or leasing. Citing the growth of the subscription economy, from cell phones to Netflix to Amazon, it has created Care by Volvo. It’s a 24-month car subscription with no money down and an all-in monthly payment that covers insurance, scheduled service and wear-and-tear repairs, plus it gives subscribers the option to switch to a different vehicle after 12 months.\n\nYou sign up online and pick up your XC40s at a Volvo dealer. There are two configurations with select options offered: A T5 Momentum for $600 per month or a T5 R-Design for $700.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2019 XC40, Volvo’s new small SUV, takes aim at urban and younger buyers with a technical, even cute design and impressive attention to detail. It will do battle with established luxury subcompact SUVs like the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class.\n\nThe XC40 is no lightweight compared with Volvo’s well-regarded bigger SUVs (except in actual weight): It offers most of the multimedia and safety tech brainpower of the compact XC60 and the mid-size three-row XC90, Cars.com’s Best of 2016 winner. But it comes in a tidier, city-size package that’s almost a foot shorter and priced about $6,000 lower than a comparable XC60.\n\nFor this review, I drove the two versions that went on sale first, the T5 Momentum and a sportier T5 R-Design. A fancier top-of-the-line T5 Inscription trim level now has joined the lineup; all three share the same powertrain and all-wheel drive. Due in the summer of 2018 are less expensive T4 versions with front-wheel drive and a less powerful engine, and Volvo says hybrid and battery-electric models are coming down the road. Overall, I found the XC40 to be a stylish, fun-to-drive model that packs the utility of a bigger SUV.\n\nDistinctive, Not Pretentious\n\nThe XC40 has a family resemblance to Volvo’s bigger SUVs, particularly in the tall taillights and “Thor’s Hammer” LED daytime running lights. Its upright profile is all SUV, not a dressed-up, lower-slung hatchback like some competitors.\n\nThe car riffs on these themes with a taut, original shape and a youthful attitude: It has a concave grille, big upswept back pillars and a “floating” roof offered in contrasting black or white. There’s even a Momentum version that combines the available white contrast roof with white mirror caps and white wheels. That one was a bit too retro-white-go-go-boots for me, but the interesting blue-gray paint that went with it stood out as my favorite.\n\nThe R-Design gets a sportier attitude with its own blacked-out grille, a black roof, some gloss-black trim and bigger, 19-inch standard wheels. The Inscription, meanwhile, is a bit more conservative, with no contrast roof, a fancier premium grille and a return to 18-inch standard wheels.\n\nThe big, upswept back pillar is a standout design element, though it cuts rear visibility to the point that you really need the available 360-degree camera display and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking. A subtler touch is the little rubber Swedish flag tag at the corner of the clamshell hood — a nod to Volvo’s heritage, though the XC40 is built in Belgium and Volvo is now owned by China’s Geely.\n\nOverall, the XC40 is a fresh, technical-looking design that Volvo says drew on sources as diverse as street fashion, designer goods, urban architecture and pop culture. While many luxury rivals try hard to look like Mini-Me versions of their bigger, more expensive stablemates, the XC40 stands on its own with a distinctive — but not pretentious — design that fits its small size.\n\nNot Just Fun to Look At\n\nThe current T5 versions are all powered by a zippy 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard AWD that includes hill start assist and hill descent control. We didn’t drive the upcoming XC40 T4 base model with a 187-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and FWD.\n\nOur test vehicles’ 258 pounds-feet of torque came on early and stayed late, providing plenty of scoot around town with very little turbo lag and plenty in reserve for highway passing and on-ramps. The engine is a version of the base four-cylinder from Volvo’s bigger, heavier SUVs, but it shines in this smaller package. Volvo estimates the XC40 will go from zero-to-60 mph in a respectable 6.2 seconds.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic’s shifts are not always silky smooth. I was more than willing to forgive that, however, for the way it willingly downshifts to tap more power. The XC40 has five selectable drive modes (Eco, Comfort, Dynamic, Off-Road and Individual) that provide modestly different throttle, steering and transmission response.\n\nMy only real nitpick with the powertrain is that it drives better than it sounds — the same complaint we lodge against Volvo’s larger models. The engine is a little buzzy when pushed, and the quiet cabin made it seem even more intrusive. The engine start-stop system is also a little rough in its stops and restarts.\n\nThe 248-hp, AWD XC40 has been EPA-rated a decent 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined, though it wants premium gasoline. That matches the rating (and thirst for premium gas) of AWD versions of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 (23/31/26 mpg), and it beats the ratings for AWD versions of the 2018 BMW X1 xDrive28i (22/31/25 mpg) and 2018 Audi Q3 (20/28/23 mpg). See their EPA ratings compared here.\n\nThe XC40 is the first Volvo on the automaker’s new Compact Modular Architecture, so it has its own suspension with struts in the front and a multilink coil-spring suspension in the rear. The R-Design gets sportier tuning, but both models are firm without being harsh, and they’re relatively flat in cornering. Coming in the summer of 2018 is an adaptive suspension option. As a fundamentally FWD design with its weight concentrated forward, the XC40 understeers when cornering hard. Steering is responsive but also lighter than desirable, though that’s less true in Sport mode.\n\nOverall, the XC40 is fun to drive — more so than its small SUV peers (at least the versions that haven’t been tricked up (and priced up) by their brands’ performance divisions, such as Mercedes’ AMG).\n\nLess Elegant Inside, But Still Premium\n\nInside, the nature-inspired Scandinavian elegance of bigger Volvo SUVs gives way to a funkier design — still Scandinavian, but with patterned metal trim and some color choices you’d more likely see at Ikea than in nature, such as a red leather option or 1970s Lava Orange door panels and footwells. Yes, there is more plastic below your elbow than in a more expensive Volvo, but the effect is still premium thanks to creative design and quality materials in the places you look at and touch most. That ranges from the standard leather seating in all XC40s — unlike most of its rivals — to the original and eco-friendly feltlike material lining the door panels, which is made from 97 percent recycled water bottles. Adding to the premium feel is the fact that the cabin is well-insulated from road and tire noise.\n\nThe interior also feels spacious and airy despite the XC40’s 174.2-inch length — 1.6 inches shorter than a Subaru Crosstrek subcompact SUV. A relatively long 106.4-inch wheelbase and tall body combine to create the roominess inside.\n\nThe front seats were comfortable and supportive for a long drive, and they include extendable thigh support — no less than I expect from a company known for its seats. The backseat is less satisfying, offering sufficient space for adults only if the front occupant compromises a little. The base cushion is also too low and short for good thigh support, and the non-reclining seatback seemed a bit too vertical for my back.\n\nAs with the exterior, the R-Design Interior adds sportier details, including an R-Design steering wheel, pedals and gearshift. Also, the leather seating surfaces have a Nubuck finish. The Inscription, meanwhile, adds tonier details, including an available crystal shift knob and driftwood trim.\n\nPutting the Utility in SUV\n\nOne key way Volvo is trying to set the XC40 apart from rivals — most of which have limited cabin storage — is with one of the most practical interiors this side of a minivan. Most striking are the carve-outs reclaiming space from inside the door. The big bins in the front doors are made possible by new-design woofers behind the dash that eliminate the need for large lower-door speakers.\n\nOther details include a removable trash receptacle ahead of the center console storage bin to catch the odd small trash and wrappers that otherwise end up in cupholders, a “phablet”-sized device bin at the front of the console, and card/parking pass holders both to the left of the driver and out of sight above the device bin. The glove box cover has a flip-out hook for a handbag or takeout bag weighing up to 4.5 pounds. There’s even more storage space under both front seats, with an available drawer under the driver’s seat. With all of these spaces available, the cupholders might actually be used for cups.\n\nThe cargo area includes 20.7 cubic feet behind the backseat (including an underfloor bin). That’s a lot compared with, for example, the 16.7 cubic feet behind the backseat in an Audi Q3. The XC40’s rear seats fold to create 47.2 cubic feet of space, with a flat floor measuring more than 5 feet long by more than 3 feet wide. A clever rear cargo floor option can be folded to stand up as a divider that includes bag hooks while restraining smaller items close to the liftgate. And in a detail that should be in all SUVs, the retractable cover stores onboard under the floor.\n\nFull-Size Technology and Safety\n\nWhile the XC40 is a smaller Volvo, its safety and multimedia technology has not been downsized. The standard City Safety system includes low-speed front collision warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian, bicycle and large animal detection. Volvo’s Pilot Assist system, which combines sophisticated adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering, is available, as is rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking and a 360-degree camera system. The XC40 does not yet have crash-test ratings.\n\nThe XC40 also has a configurable 12.3-inch display for the standard instrument panel — a premium touch. Dominating the center of the dashboard and angled slightly toward the driver is the same vertically oriented 9-inch touchscreen as in the XC60, which handles almost all the climate and audio controls, as well as many other vehicle functions. It’s just as sharp and colorful as in the XC60 — and just as distracting to use on the move. Thankfully, there’s a volume knob, but a few more touch-without-looking physical controls would go a long way here.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard, a 4G Wi-Fi hot spot is available, and the XC40 comes with a four-year subscription to Volvo’s connected car and emergency services. The big device bin at the front of the console has 12-volt and USB ports, plus an available wireless charging pad. There’s another USB port on the rear of the console for backseat passengers, and a 12-volt power outlet in the cargo area.\n\nThe XC40 also has a smartphone-as-key app that lets the owner authorize friends or family to use the SUV and schedule their use times. With your OK through the Volvo On Call app, they don’t need a key to open and drive the car for a fixed time (and they can’t lose an expensive key fob). When time’s up, the digital key expires.\n\nCompetitive Pricing or an All-In Subscription\n\nThe T5 Momentum starts at $36,195 with destination, the sportier T5 R-Design is $38,695 and the upscale T5 Inscription is $40,745, all with the more powerful engine and AWD. The coming T4 Momentum entry model, with FWD and less power, will start at $34,195, and other T4 versions will be similarly cheaper. Those prices are competitive with other small luxury SUVs, and each level includes competitive (or better) standard features. Compare features and specifications with similar Mercedes-Benz GLA, BMW X1 and Audi A3 models here.\n\nAlso like its luxury rivals, it’s easy to quickly pad the XC40’s sticker price. Both our test cars were well-equipped with options, and the Momentum as-tested totaled $44,315, while the R-Design sticker was $45,935. That pricing, however, is still well under the next size up in luxury SUVs, including Volvo’s XC60. The XC40’s room and features might suffice for a lot of buyers without taking that expensive next step.\n\nIn addition to purchase and traditional leasing options, Volvo also offers an all-in subscription route into an XC40. Care by Volvo is a 24-month subscription with no money down and a monthly payment that covers insurance, scheduled service and wear-and-tear repairs, and it gives subscribers the option to switch to a different vehicle after 12 months. You sign up online for a choice between two fixed configurations with select option packages: a T5 Momentum for $600 per month or a T5 R-Design for $700.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nThe pert-looking XC40 is Volvo’s smallest SUV, though it has the same polished driving manners and refined design found in the automaker’s larger offerings. The 2023 XC40 is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which is new for 2023 and available in two forms: a 194-horsepower variant (dubbed B4) and a 247-hp B5 version. Both are coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The B4 powertrain is only available with front-wheel drive, while the B5 gets standard all-wheel drive.\n\nThere’s also an XC40 Recharge Pure Electric variant. Its 402-hp EV powertrain comes standard with AWD and delivers an EPA-estimated driving range of 223 miles. XC40 competitors include the Lexus UX, BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. If you’re shopping for pure-electric rivals, consider the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q4 E-Tron and Jaguar I-Pace.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nIn addition to its new engine, the XC40 gets new trim-level names for 2023: base Core, mid-range Plus, and range-topping Ultimate. A Google-based infotainment system is newly standard, and a modest exterior refresh includes revised headlights, a redesigned front grille and bumper, and new wheel-design choices.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volvo XC40 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPower-folding side mirrors\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat with memory feature\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane-centering steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volvo XC40?\n\nWith its new, more efficient mild-hybrid engine lineup, not to mention the available all-electric Recharge model, the Volvo XC40 is a functional and eco-minded pick among small luxury SUVs. The XC40 has a firm but well-controlled ride that pairs nicely with its accurate handling, and its cabin is spacious and attractive. The base B4 powertrain should be peppy enough for many SUV shoppers, but the stronger B5 engine and its standard AWD are worth the $2,000 upgrade. The Recharge model’s driving range is middling, but its 402-hp AWD powertrain turns the XC40 into a hot rod.",
