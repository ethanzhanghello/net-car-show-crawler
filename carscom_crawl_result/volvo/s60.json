      "expert_review": "The sense is incongruous with the image when you climb behind the wheel of a Volvo knowing that the car has been ”electronically limited” to a top speed of 155 miles per hour – a speed that comes from an engine pounding out 300 horsepower.\n\nVolvos, my father once told me, were the choice of the tweed-jacket-suede-elbows set; of guys who smoked pipes and had beards; of women in peasant blouses.\n\nThese were sturdy, safe, reliable cars with the durability and performance appeal of your average brick.\n\nBut then, in recent years, they took Volvo out of the box: got rid of the hard lines and sharp corners and gave the Volvo a soft, round, aerodynamic feel.\n\nThen they brought in all-wheel-drive, not just as a safety/bad weather feature, but also as a performance feature.\n\nAnd now, Volvo has completed the transformation, swapping that old square box appeal for the round, halo effect of a high-performance car.\n\nMeet the 2004 Volvo S60 R.\n\nI am as surprised to be writing this as you probably are to be reading it, but here is a Volvo designed to go head to head with Audi’s S4 and A4 3.0 Quattro; with the BMW 330xi, the Mercedes C320, and the Lexus IS 300, even hot Ford Mustangs. And at a purported 0-60 time of 5.4 seconds, this sedan is faster than all of them.\n\nIt is powered by a 2.5 liter, inline, five-cylinder engine that, besides that 300 horsepower, produces a tugging 295 lb.-ft. of torque. That’s deep pulling power.\n\nTwin intercoolers (tucked into a lengthened Volvo nose) breathe welcome air for the big turbocharger, and a six-speed manual transmission (as tested) clicks through the gears in snappy, short throws as that turbo does its boosting. A five-speed automatic ”Geartronic” transmission is also available.\n\nVic Doolen, the president and CEO of Volvo Cars North America, says the S60 R is proof that, ”You can have performance on demand, comfort on demand, sport on demand,” and that these attributes will let Volvo ”replace Mercedes, BMWs, in other peoples’ garages.”\n\nAnd if that replacement takes place, it seems, it will be very much an age and gender thing.\n\nVolvo estimates that the typical S60 R buyer will be between 35 and 45 years old, ”have a genuine detailed interest in cars, and they read buff books (those are the glossy car magazines), displaying a keen interest in performance cars.”\n\nThe curious thing is that, as much as Volvo, with its tweedy hints of intelligence and academia in its past stereotyping, seemed to lure the cerebral, the S60 R may, itself, be smarter than many of its drivers.\n\nWe’re talking finely honed central intelligence here. Consider that sensors in this car monitor longitudinal, lateral, and vertical acceleration through a system called Continuously Controlled Chassis Concept. Four-C (get it?)\n\nIt watches the rotational speed and vertical movement of each wheel; steering wheel deflection and speed of turn; cornering, engine torque, intervention of ABS and stability control systems. And then, 500 times per second, it adjusts the shock absorbers to handle whatever is coming their way, be it yaw, roll, or nose dive.\n\nIn addition, if it senses an emergency punch at the brakes, it adjusts shocks to handle oncoming force even before the 4-piston calipers actually touch the nearly 13-inch disc brakes.\n\nThe result is a stable ride in cornering, braking, and fast lane changes. And that ride can be adjusted, through three buttons on the dash, for comfort, sport, or advanced driving. Comfort absorbs road woes the way Rosie’s papertowels used to soak up spills in the TV ads. Sport stiffens the suspension for hard road work. Advanced? Meet me on a racetrack somewhere for this steel-hard sensation of flat cornering.\n\nThe interior is a true cockpit of performance, from the gun metal blue gauges to the stiffly bolstered seats. Don’t need you rockin’ and rollin’ in your Volvo t 155 mph on that racetrack. The instrument cluster on the center dash stack is easy to comprehend and use. Air bags, front, side, and rear, protect all occupants.\n\nVolvo intends to sell about 10,000 S60 Rs worldwide each year; 3,800 in the United States.\n\nAnd at the price for such a phenomenal, advanced piece of machinery ($37,000-$47,000 depending on options and dealer gouging), there will be no problem meeting those goals.\n\nAnd when you consider that the R model is also available as a station wagon, the V70 R, there is the option of bringing home the groceries real fast.\n\nI sure hope this engine appears in the high-tech, incredibly safe and stable SUV Volvo, the XC 90. (If Porsche can build a 165 mile-per-hour SUV, why can’t Volvo build a 155 mph SUV?)\n\nNice touch: The three-button, flow-directing, climate control shaped like a human body. Head, torso, legs. Even I could figure it out.\n\nAnnoyance: I wish this all-wheel-drive car, with all its power, had a rear-wheels torque bias. If you got the muscle, it would be nice to be able to induce oversteer.",

      "expert_review": "I’d been waiting, hoping and wishing that I’d get the opportunity to drive Volvo’s highly anticipated redesigned 2011 S60. I’m having a love affair with sedans now that my kids are old enough to get in the car and buckle up on their own. No more head-bonks and back pains for this mama when I’m in a sedan. The timing for my test of the S60 couldn’t have been better.\n\nJust sitting still, the car looked beautiful. The S60 has a curvier, lower-profile feel than previous models. The C-pillar is pushed back, giving the S60 a coupe-like look that’s pretty hot right now. I was impressed that the redesign was so thorough. Would the drive live up to the looks?\n\nMy first outing in the S60 was no disappointment. The Vibrant Copper paint color let everyone know I was coming.  Not that anyone had a chance to really overthink it; with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine, I didn’t stick around long enough for bystanders to question what they just saw. Tight handling from this all-wheel-drive sedan was spot-on, adding a thrill to every turn and maintaining spotless integrity on the straightaways.\n\nIf you thought that a fancy-pants Scandinavian speed machine would be priced through the roof, you’re partly right. While the S60’s base price starts at $37,700, my test car had a couple optional packages that bumped up the price by $8,500 to arrive at $46,200. \n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe S60’s lines make the car so much more modern and beautiful than the average sedan. I especially love the look of the S60’s rear end. The taillights follow the lines of the trunk lid and keep the back interesting. The front end has an aggressive stance that’s complemented by the race-inspired headlights and air vents.\n\nRace-inspired means I’m more inclined to race around in a car, and that lead foot of mine did have a price because I didn’t come close to meeting the S60’s EPA-estimated fuel economy of 18/26 mpg city/highway. The 2011 S60 has a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic. The S60 uses premium gas, so my heavy foot caused me some pain at the gas pump.\n\nFor the kids, getting in and out of the S60 was easy. The doors weren’t too big or wide, and they felt solid and sturdy. The interior door handles were easy to reach for my kids, so closing the doors on their own was a piece of cake. Yet the doors still felt solid and sturdy.  That’s a rare combination, that one!\n\nThe S60’s cargo area is a decent size, but it seemed to fill up quickly after a trip to Costco.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great \nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\n\nYes, I’ve already mentioned the S60’s copper color, and I might have mentioned how much I really liked it.  Well, guess what? The S60’s interior is copper, too. Actually, it’s called Beechwood Brown and it looks more of a pumpkin color than copper. Stitched orange leather graces the interior in abundance. Sure, there’s some black leather, too, but it’s not the first thing you see. Here’s the hiccup: I loved the orange on the outside, but I didn’t love it as much inside this five-seater. I’d love it on the inside if it came in smaller doses.\n\nVolvo’s signature slim center stack is present in the redesigned S60, and this design element never wears out its welcome. The tray behind it is fun to use and always a crowd pleaser. The center stack has a metal inlay, which Volvo calls Shimmering Graphite. I call it beautiful. It looks like wood at first. Not much has changed with the controls themselves and that’s good. I did like the button that when depressed dropped the rear head restraints for better visibility out the rear window.\n\nThe information system’s screen is easy to read and see. Opposite this modern, fancy screen are the dot-matrix-like readouts on the instrument gauges. Everything else on the car seemed detailed, modern and sophisticated, which made the instrument readouts seem ancient. \n\nThe S60 has covered cupholders in the front and rear seats. Anytime you can disguise a mess, it’s a good thing. In the back, the cupholders are in the armrest so they are easily accessible by the kids.  Speaking of kids, mine liked the S60. They liked the roominess and the color, of course.  More than that, they’re like their mom and they love the speed. Turbo makes kids happy; I highly recommend it.  Adults fit well in the back, too, which was a great aspect of the S60.  It looks small, but it can carry people comfortably.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this may be the longest section of the review of the 2011 S60.  Volvo doesn’t skimp a bit on safety, which is something any parent can appreciate. \n\nStandard safety equipment includes four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control, active head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Volvo’s City Safety system also comes standard. It puts the brakes on for you in slow-speed traffic situations when a collision is eminent.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t brake; it just means that if you’re not paying attention in bumper-to-bumper traffic and the car in front of you suddenly brakes, the S60 will apply the brakes if you haven’t done so. Standard! That’s amazing.\n\nIf you want to amp up the already beefy safety components, you can add the Technology Package ($2,100). This includes Volvo’s Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake, which can prevent a collision with a car or person at speeds under 22 mph; adaptive cruise control and a lane departure warning system. A backup camera is part of the Multimedia Package ($2,700), which includes a navigation system, and front and rear parking sensors are optional and cost $500.\n\nChild-safety seats fit pretty well in the S60, but there’s a bit of seat bolstering that can make installing the car seats a little tricky.  With the driver’s seat set at my preferred position, it was a tight fit for the rear-facing infant-safety seat in the second row. If you’re shorter, it may not be a problem.\n\nThe two sets of lower Latch anchors are easy to get to, and the three tether anchors also are easy to access because the head restraints collapse downward.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Volvo S60 here.",

      "expert_review": "Every time I get into a new Volvo, I’m impressed by the interesting and desirable automobiles now produced by the once-staid Swede. Each one seems better than the last, and now the new S60 T5 takes its place as one of my sporty favorites.\n\nUsually, you can’t read a review of any new Volvo without encountering mean words about its past: boxy, boring, ugly, funky cars that favored safety over pizzazz.\n\nPhooey.\n\nThe fact is, I’m among the rare breed of car enthusiasts who actually like Volvos, from the turtle-back 444s of the ’50s, through the solid 122s, and into the 140 and 240 series. The Ford representative in Phoenix used to mock me for favoring Volvos, that is until Ford bought Volvo a few years back. Shut him up quick.\n\nVolvo’s transition from boxy to sexy has been gradual. The S60 is the newest member of Volvo’s clan, a compact sedan built on a smaller version of the S80 platform and carrying over the corporate styling, including the uniquely shouldered tail end. The T5 version is the hot one, with a high-pressure turbo that boosts its 2.3-liter, five-cylinder engine to a muscular 247 horsepower.\n\nNo doubt, T5 is a top-drawer sports sedan that performs brilliantly on the open highway, on winding two-lane blacktops and in city traffic. Fast and sure-footed, the T5 was a fine conveyance for a trip north through Flagstaff, Page and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nAccompanied by the musical tone of the turbo five under acceleration, the S60 coddled passengers as the miles rushed under the wheels. The steering is tight and responsive, if somewhat light to the touch. The pliant suspension allows flat cornering while soaking up rough surfaces. As in most Volvos, braking is excellent.\n\nThe T5 comes standard with a five-speed stickshift, though the test car came with a smooth-shifting automatic that also allows the driver to change gears manually.\n\nThe phrase “beautiful Volvo” might still sound strange, but the S60 enhanced with T5 design cues provoked many admiring looks that turned to surprise as people discovered that the gorgeous sedan that just whooshed past is indeed a Volvo.\n\nThe interior is pleasant and fairly roomy, all upgraded with fragrant leather and power features in this high-end version. Legroom is good up front but a bit tight in the rear.\n\nInside this otherwise pleasant cabin is where you find the major flaw in the S60: an ugly and confusing console that’s surprisingly hard to master. The surface is flat plastic, and the dials look bulbous. Really, I haven’t liked any of the center console layouts in recent Volvos, especially considering that this automaker prides itself on brilliant ergonomics. The radio dials are a particular mess, with presets that are hard to program and difficult to use without looking away from the road. The sound system was also problematic, with the back seat getting only a portion of the stereo through the rear speakers.\n\nThe basic S60 starts at $26,550 with a 2.4-liter, 168-horsepower engine. The next model, the S60 T, is powered by a light-pressure turbocharged version for the same engine, which delivers 197 horsepower and starts at just under $30,000. The T5 starts at $31,800, and the fully loaded test S60 came perilously close to $40,000. That wide price range is packed with fine machines, including Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 330i, Audi A4, Lexus ES 300, Saab 9-5 and Lincoln LS, plus the new Jaguar X-Type and Cadillac CTS.\n\nBeing a Volvo, the S60 boasts advanced safety features including progressive front airbags; side-impact airbags and curtains, front and rear; three-point seatbelts with pyrotechnic pre-tensioners; whiplash-protection; and Volvo’s advanced crush-zone protection.\n\nBeauty, brawn and a social consciousness, the S60 T5 should continue Volvo’s rising fortune, as well as attracting image-conscious vers.",

      "expert_review": "For 2017, the Volvo S60 comes in T5 Dynamic, T6 R-Design and high-performance Polestar variants. Compare them here. Volvo simplified the S60’s trim levels and engines for 2017; compare the 2017 with the 2016 S60 here. Front-wheel drive is standard on the T5 (all-wheel drive is optional) and the T6 and Polestar get AWD standard. We cover the outdoorsy S60 Cross Country and extended-length S60 Inscription, which adds backseat legroom, separately on Cars.com.\n\nFirm & Fast\nThe Inside\nLuxury Value\n\nThe Volvo S60 has its drawbacks, but the base price — from about $35,000 for the reasonably equipped T5 up to the mid-$50,000s for a loaded T6 — represents a considerable value versus leading sports sedans from Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz. Volvo might even draw a few shoppers away from entry-luxury subcompacts, like the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class and Audi A3, a group for which the S60 is a far better alternative.\n\nVolvo just unveiled a redesigned XC60 SUV with similar panache to the excellent XC90 and S90. Given the schedule of redesigns on the automaker’s 60-series cars, a new Volvo S60 is certainly nigh. Still, the outgoing car remains a solid effort — age notwithstanding. Sports-sedan shoppers looking to save a few (thousand) bucks should give Volvo a gander. Just skip that Sport chassis.",

      "expert_review": "Here in what we call the Midwest, Left Coasters call Back East, and Easterners call Indian Country, we spent all summer hoping and praying for rain, but neither our optimism nor our pleas for intercession were heeded.\n\nIt was a near-disaster for farmers, as I frequently reminded myself when I lamented the lack of precipitation’s impact on my requirements as an auto tester. If I managed the weather, there would be at least one day a week with steady, sometimes torrential rain, the better to judge vehicles’ tap-dancing prowess. Ah, well, absent the cloud droppings, one does the best one can, substituting more vigorous driving for the loss of friction nature sometimes provides.\n\nThe week I tested today’s car was typically hot and dry. Pity, since the victim in question was a newly all-wheel-drive sedan from Volvo. The S60 was introduced as a front-driver a year earlier, and picked up 150 pounds’ worth of extra drive gear for the 2002 model-year run.\n\nScandinavians don’t endure winter, they embrace it, with rallies across ice and snow conditions that would have most of us curled by the fireplace. Still, most of the cars they turn into missiles are front-wheel-drive, albeit with special winter tires sometimes carrying spikes. So they’ve been a little late arriving at the AWD party, but the mechanism used in the S60, very similar to the one we’ve seen in their Cross Country crossover vehicle, is as sophisticated as they come.\n\nNot many folks in the U.S. bother with getting special snow tires, because the standard run of all-seasons are pretty good. But having the edge of AWD is quite appealing in freezing zones. Volvo calls its system Active-on-Demand.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the S60 AWD acts and feels like a front-drive car. But if the front wheels start to slip, power can be allocated to the rear axle in an infinitely-variable ratio via a wet-plate clutch (on the rear axle). All this overseen, of course, by a team of sensors and microcomputers. Driver merely reaps the benefits, most of the time not even knowing it\n\nVolvo says the clutch can start locking up within 15 degrees’ driveshaft rotation – that’s close enough to instantaneous for me. At the same time, the system is smart enough to recognize that the difference in rotational speed of the front and rear wheels caused by backing into a parallel parking spot doesn’t mean it has to kick in.\n\nI’ve seen this approach before, along with the rival viscous-coupling approach, such as Subaru and Audi use. There, a fluid in a center differential heats up and becomes thicker when front and rear are out of sync. That’s probably not quite so fast as Volvo’s system, but in practical terms, for the kind of winter driving most of us do, the difference wouldn’t be perceptible. The viscous approach seems more elegant and perhaps more durable.\n\nTo test Volvo’s system, I found some fields that in the drought had turned rock hard, with a coating of dust that simulated we t pavement. On full-throttle burnouts, the front wheels appeared to kick up a little dust as they spun before the rears started shouldering part of the load, but on the whole, blasting off under such conditions was hardly different from doing the same on dry concrete.\n\nOn the stretch of road I normally use for hot-rod tests – good concrete – the S60 easily broke the 8-second barrier, though, like all AWD machines, it didn’t FEEL that fast. The S60 AWD also comes with stability and traction control. With all that going for you, you should make it through anything that’s less than axle height, though there’s no pretense of being an off-roader.\n\nAll the motivation comes from a five-cylinder alloy engine that displaces 2.4 liters. It is urged on via a high-pressure turbo. With 20 valves, variably timed, and dual overhead camshafts, it has been biased toward the low rpm range, which is the way to do it for the speed-constrained U.S. market. The engine delivers 197 hp at 6,000 rpm. Torque (210 foot-pounds) peaks at 1,800 rpm and stays there out to 5,000.\n\nOf course recommended petrol is of the 91-octane sort. EPA ratings are 26 mpg highway, 19 city. With quite a bit of cruising as well as some fuel-sucking stunts, I managed 23.3 overall. The result is quick response and a readiness to go at most any speed.\n\nThe five-speed “Geartronic” automatic transmission can be shifted manually, or you can just let the little computer demons adapt to your needs and style. It shifted well, but was not among the “smartest” I’ve encountered. Forced downshifts, as from third to second, were often hesitant and rough.\n\nIf you need to stop, you can rely on the car’s four-wheel disc brakes with antilock. The pedal feel was excellent, a joy to modulate during tests, and stopping distances were impressively short.\n\nOn the passive safety front, the S60 has dual-stage front air bags, of course, plus side and head curtain bags for the front-seat occupants.\n\nThe S60 is a distinctive, handsome machine — a sedan that almost tricks the eye into thinking it’s a sportier coupe, and it has just enough curviness to elicit second glances. Inside, it’s more stark than luxurious, but in a purposeful way. Controls are properly sized and well-situated. The optional leather seating was pleasing to the senses both tactile and olfactory. The gauges were dazzling — in the good sense. Electroluminescent, they could be easily seen regardless of ambient conditions. The stereo was excellent, with impressive clarity and good tuner sensitivity. It’s an AM-FM-CD-cassette unit with six speakers. Basic controls, illuminated, are placed on the steering wheel hub. The rear compartment is about what one would expect in a midsize car – not the place for excursions, but fine for urban jaunts.\n\nWith anti-roll bars front and rear, the S60 cornered quite flat. Ride quality overall was quite good, just right for a low-luxury sport sedan, with a feel for what’s important and filtration of annoyances like expansion joints. Given the S60’s rather tidy wheelbase, I was surprised that its turning circle is nearly 39 feet, a number that’s important when trying to slip into narrow slots at the mall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testers gave the S60 a four-star rating for occupant protection in frontal impacts, five stars for side impacts. Five is the top mark on their scale.\n\nIn the tougher 40-mph frontal offset crash engineered by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the S60 garnered a rating of Good, their top designation. They had reservations about the leg-protection component, rating it Acceptable. On IIHS’s tests of bumper fragility, the S60 sustained an average of $909 damage when hitting things at 5 mph. That’s about mid-pack for their class of medium luxury sedans.\n\nGoing the extra mile for environme ntal protection, Volvo has coated the S60’s radiator with a catalytic agent that turns ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2). The S60 is assembled in Ghent, Belgium, with careful attention to details of fit and finish.\n\nThe tester had a few extras: metallic paint, $400; leather seating, $1,300; an air-quality sensor (this turns off outside air when it detects excessive levels of pollution), $125. Total suggested price thus became, with freight, $35,825. Edmund.com suggests the average buyer is getting about $1,400 off – maybe more, now that 2003s are arriving. At full retail, payments would be $726, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 payments.",

Volvo also sells a plug-in hybrid version of the S60 that generates 455 hp and comes standard with AWD. The S60 plug-in hybrid can travel up to 40 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volvo S60?\n\nThe S60 is carried over essentially unchanged for 2025, its final year in the U.S. market.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe Volvo S60 is a five-seat luxury sedan that competes with the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Power comes from a 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. Volvo also sells a Recharge plug-in hybrid version of the S60 that generates 455 hp and comes standard with AWD. The S60 Recharge can travel up to 41 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe S60 sees only minor changes for 2024. In addition to some trim and feature-availability tweaks, the Recharge’s performance-oriented Polestar Engineered trim has been discontinued, and the non-hybrid S60’s line-topping Ultimate trim now comes standard with AWD.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo S60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nFront-wheel drive\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nPower-folding side mirrors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFoglights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver attention monitor\nRear parking sensors\nRemote keyless entry with push-button start\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nImitation leather upholstery\nPower front seats with lumbar support\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAll-wheel drive\nHeated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRemote start\nUpgraded Harman Kardon audio system\nHead-up display\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLeather seating surfaces\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nNavigation\n360-degree camera\nFront camera\nCruise-control steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe S60 is a stylish alternative to traditional entry-level luxury sedans, with a distinctively classy character and exceptional everyday comfort. The plug-in hybrid is surprisingly powerful and offers excellent electric-only range. The S60’s driving experience, however, may not meet enthusiasts’ standards, and passengers don’t have a lot of extra space.",

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for 2019, the S60 comes in Momentum, R-Design and Inscription variants. A standard turbocharged four-cylinder (labeled T5) drives the front wheels, while an optional turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder (T6) pairs with all-wheel drive. Later in 2019, an electric motor will turn the T6 into an even quicker car: a plug-in hybrid T8, which Cars.com covers separately as the S60 Hybrid. For a handful of customers, a range-topping T8 modified by Volvo’s performance affiliate, Polestar, features even more tweaks. Compare all the variants here, or stack up the 2018 and 2019 S60. As its name suggests, the S60 is closely related to the V60 wagon and XC60 SUV; compare them here.\n\nThe S60’s varied lineup has something-for-everyone potential, but our particular test car, an S60 R-Design T6, illustrates one way not to get it: with upsized wheels and Volvo’s Sport Chassis.\n\nHarsh, Not Sporty\n\nA $200 option on the R-Design T5 or T6, the Sport Chassis has firmer springs and shocks, plus a half-inch-lower ride height than the S60’s standard suspension. Paired with optional 19-inch wheels and Continental P235/40R19 high-performance summer tires, this suspension has an objectionably firm ride: Shock absorption is harsh, and the chassis seldom isolates occupants from dips and rises in the pavement, even small ones. Expect turbulence at any speed over all but the smoothest roads.\n\nThose offenses would be forgivable if the S60 offered a dramatic handling payoff, but a sporty car this is not. With temperatures in the high 40s during our handling tests, the Continental tires gripped well enough, but Volvo’s all-wheel-drive system did little to hide the S60’s front-biased layout. Apply enough gas through a corner, and the AWD in Volvo’s 60-series cars can send a little more power to the rear, nudging the tail a bit sideways to reorient the car, but it’s far from the sort of balance you get in true rear-drive AWD systems — or even front-drive ones with more proactive distribution, such as the Acura TLX and Audi A4. Likewise, the S60’s steering has numb feedback and a slow overall ratio, especially versus nimble competitors like the Jaguar XE and Genesis G70.\n\nThis isn’t the first time a sportified S60 variant has eviscerated ride quality: The prior generation’s optional Sport Chassis had similarly poor execution. The base wheels (18-inchers with higher-sidewall P235/45R18 tires) might improve ride comfort, as could the S60’s optional adaptive shock absorbers or suspension tuning without the Sport Chassis. Indeed, our L.A. Bureau Chief Brian Wong had no qualms about ride quality in his First Drive of an R-Design with 19s and the adaptive shocks, and we found shock absorption — though not isolation — better in a similarly equipped V60. Test-drive one of the S60’s other setups if you can.\n\nWith 316 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, the T6 moves vigorously once all systems are go, but there’s noticeable accelerator lag and a lazy automatic engine stop-start system that delay movement for a few moments after you hit the gas. (You can permanently disable idle-stop, at least.) Depress the pedal on the highway for passing power, and the S60’s standard eight-speed automatic transmission lags too long before it initiates a downshift. A selectable Dynamic driving mode does little to lessen the lag.\n\nVolvo says the S60 T6 hits 60 mph in 5.3 seconds, versus 6.2 seconds for the T5 engine (250 hp, 258 pounds-feet). Polestar tuning, available as an accessory package on the T5 and T6, adds incremental power via software changes. The S60 T8, meanwhile, gets a combined 400 hp and 472 pounds-feet of torque — enough to hit 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, or 4.3 for the Polestar Engineered S60 T8, which is a separate high-performance edition rather than an accessory package. That’s blazing quick, to be sure, but performance enthusiasts can get much quicker numbers in the highest-performance variants of certain S60 rivals.\n\nFamiliar, Outside and In\n\nSome 5 inches longer than its predecessor but still more than a foot shorter than Volvo’s flagship S90 sedan, the S60 and V60 wagon follow the XC60 SUV, with horizontal lines and sleek Thor’s hammer headlights. Inside and out, the family resemblance means you might mistake an S60 for a larger S90. Both sedans carry themes similar to what Volvo introduced with the current XC90, Cars.com’s Best of 2016 recipient. Given how well such styling has aged, I’m glad Volvo stayed the course.\n\nThe cabin carries the same tech-centric minimalism of Volvo’s other cars. The automaker’s now-familiar 9-inch touchscreen is standard, as are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Volvo puts too many functions onscreen rather than giving them separate physical controls — I’d prefer a dedicated tuning knob and separate climate dials, for example — but the menus are intuitive and overall touchscreen response is fast, bolstered by a hardier processor for all 2019 Volvos.\n\nOne editor bemoaned the S60’s prominent center console, which has decent storage provisions but space-inhibiting bulk. It’s also shod in hard plastic, not the padding many cars now employ — a letdown among otherwise good cabin materials. Some occupants may find the lower cushions in the R-Design’s bolstered sport seats too constraining; Momentum and Inscription editions have less bolstering. Perhaps more relevant to all seating types, our test car’s chairs had limited height-adjustment range and snug headroom. If you’re tall or like to sit high, take note.\n\nThe backseat has decent legroom but a low seating position for adults, though it’s aided by a steep lower-cushion angle that supports the thighs and makes it feel like you aren’t squatting. I found the R-Design’s backrests too washboard-like for comfort (again, Momentum and Inscription models have slightly different backseat cushions). But available amenities abound: Outboard passengers can get their own heated seats and climate zones, the latter with air vents on the center console and B-pillars. And in one of my favorite Volvo traditions, drivers can flip down the backseat head restraints at the touch of a button to aid rear visibility.\n\nWinning Potential?\n\nPricing for the S60 runs right in the thick of other luxury sports sedans. The T5 Momentum starts around $37,000, including destination charge. A factory-loaded T8 Inscription will set you back some $65,000, but its 10.4-kilowatt-hour battery should qualify for the same federal tax credits — about $5,000 — as Volvo’s other T8 vehicles. (As of this writing, the EPA has yet to publish tax credits or mileage ratings for the T8.) Care by Volvo, a vehicle subscription program, allows you to own a preconfigured Momentum or R-Design for a flat monthly fee that includes insurance. The T8 Polestar comes only by subscription, and Volvo’s limited allotment for 2019 is already spoken for.\n\nCrash tests are unavailable as of this writing. Once it’s tested, results for the 2019 version of the S60 will replace the 2018 results on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s mid-size luxury cars page. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, and a drowsy-driver detection system are standard. So are power front seats, a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone climate controls and leatherette (vinyl) upholstery. Option up the S60, and you can get heated and ventilated front seats with massagers, Nappa leather upholstery and Bowers and Wilkins audio. Volvo’s optional Pilot Assist system — standard on the T8 and optional elsewhere — pairs adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering.\n\nThe S60 has some of the same practicalities that helped its XC60 sibling win Cars.com’s Compact Luxury SUV Challenge last year. But the XC60 won that contest despite its lackluster driving refinement, something SUV shoppers might deemphasize. By contrast, shoppers comparing the S60 to nearly a dozen rival sports sedans may not. Whether the S60’s strengths outweigh its drivability letdowns — a lot of which hinge on which version you drive — will determine your verdict.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Jan. 11, 2019, to clarify that the S60 is a sedan.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Style and technology long have been Volvo hallmarks. The automaker doubled down for 2019 on both aspects in the redesigned S60 sedan, and it also added a couple firsts to the nameplate: Volvo will produce the S60 in its first U.S. manufacturing plant and offer the car through a Care by Volvo monthly subscription service.\n\nRelated: Had One Too Many? Volvo Big Brother System Will Stop Car, Call for Help\n\nThe overhauled S60 comes in Momentum, R-Design and Inscription trims. A standard turbocharged four-cylinder (called T5) drives the front wheels, while a turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder (called T6) is optional; the latter pairs with all-wheel drive.\n\nInterested in this mid-size sedan that offers a lot of safety and luxury features? We’ve driven it, compared it against rivals and covered pricing, specs and more.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolvo’s S60 sedan slots between the company’s entry-level S40 and top-of-the-line S80; it competes with affordable, midsize luxury cars like the Acura TL and Lincoln MKZ. Front- or all-wheel-drive models are available. For 2008, the S60 loses some of its sporty cachet, as both the manual transmission and the high-performance S60 R have been dropped. The remaining trim levels receive a few more standard features.\n\nTrims include the 2.5T, 2.5T AWD and T5. The T5 gets a 258-horsepower, turbocharged five-cylinder engine, while both 2.5T models have a 236-hp turbo five. The T5 has a sport suspension and can be equipped with 17- or 18-inch wheels.\n\nEquipment ranges from modest — the base 2.5T comes with cloth upholstery, a manual passenger seat and a single CD stereo — to luxurious, with rain-sensing wipers, parking sensors and a navigation system available on the T5. All trims come with a full complement of safety features, including six airbags, anti-whiplash seats and an electronic stability system.\n\nExterior\nA curvy shape, far removed from past Volvos, gives the four-door S60 the look of a coupe. The grille and bumper were redesigned in 2006, and they appear smoother and less angular than those of older S60s. Still, as Volvo turns out newer designs such as the S80 sedan and C70 convertible, the S60’s eight-year-old profile is starting to look stale.\n\nSixteen, 17- and 18-inch wheels are available. A rear spoiler and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are both optional on the T5.\n\nInterior\nThe S60’s businesslike dashboard groups audio and climate controls within a broad center panel; it’s a design similar to the previous-generation S80. Standard features include a CD stereo — now with an auxiliary audio jack — as well as dual-zone automatic climate control and steering-wheel audio and cruise controls. Power seats, heated leather upholstery and a six-CD premium stereo are optional.\n\nUp to five occupants fit inside the S60. A split-folding rear seat expands cargo capacity beyond the trunk’s 13.9 cubic feet. A center tunnel includes a storage bin and flexible cupholder. Second-generation seats “are designed around orthopedic principles,” according to Volvo.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll S60 inline-five-cylinder engines are turbocharged. A 2.5-liter develops 208 hp in the 2.5T and 2.5T AWD. The T5’s 258-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter drives a standard five-speed automatic with a manual shifting provision. Last year’s six-speed manual has been dropped. Both 2.5T models come only with a five-speed automatic, but the manual-shift feature is optional.\n\nZero-to-60 mph acceleration ranges from 6.6 seconds in the T5 to 7.2 seconds in the AWD 2.5T, Volvo estimates. The front-wheel-drive 2.5T splits the difference at 6.9 seconds.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features for the S60 include side-impact airbags and whiplash protection for front occupants, side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes. Traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.",

      "expert_review": "Before test-driving the 2012 Volvo S60, I considered Volvos to be functional cars that included cutting-edge safety features. Put another way, I thought Volvos were dutifully practical family cars that weren’t necessarily fun to drive.\n\nThen I got behind the wheel of the 2012 Volvo S60. I found the acceleration to be so smooth and the handling to be so lovely on my test car that I double-checked the car’s logo a few times to make sure this wasn’t one of those sporty German cars in disguise.\n\nWith its 3.0-liter turbo engine that delivers 325 horsepower, the 2012 Volvo S60 T6 R-Design was a blast to drive, and it debunked my previous notions about Volvos being simply practical. The icing on the S60 T6 cake is since it’s a Volvo it’s still got the cutting-edge safety features that put any driver’s mind at ease, especially a driver with small children like me.\n\nThe S60 was redesigned for 2011. For 2012, the luxury sedan is all about new trim levels. Previously offered in only the all-wheel-drive T6 trim, Volvo has added the T5 entry-level trim and the top-of-the-line T6 R-Design, leaving the original T6 as the middle child. The T5 trim has front-wheel drive with a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine, and the upper-level T6 R-Design trim I tested has all-wheel drive and some extra ponies under the hood with a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine.\n\nThe 2012 Volvo S60 has a starting MSRP of $31,300, and the T6 R-Design trim starts at $42,950. My test car had a price tag of $46,875.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThanks to its redesign, the S60 is not the boxy Volvo from days of old. Sure, it’s a midsize sedan produced by the brand that built its name on safety, but the S60’s exterior looks verge on sexy. It has a low roofline, curves in the front and rear, and a compact body. Of course, my test car’s Passion Red paint color only added to the S60’s sex appeal.\n\nThe doors were heavy, but my older children managed to open them independently and were easily able to climb in and out of the S60. Given the car’s low lines, the trunk also sits low, which made loading things in and out particularly easy.\n\nFor someone used to a minivan’s minimum cargo volume of almost 40 cubic feet, the prospect of the S60’s diminished 12-cubic-foot trunk was daunting. The front passenger seat tries to make amends for the meager trunk space as it folds flat to allow for more interior hauling space. Truthfully, the 12 cubic feet weren’t horribly paltry. I did fit enough groceries in the trunk to feed and refresh my whole neighborhood as I was in charge of a neighborhood party.\n\nThe upper-level S60 T6 R-Design that I tested comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that delivers 325 hp. Moving down the trim level ladder from there, the original T6 — now the midlevel trim — has the same engine but delivers 300 hp and the new entry-level T5 has a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that produces 250 hp.\n\nThe S60 with the 3.0-liter engine gets an EPA-estimated 18/26 mpg city/highway, and the smaller engine gets 20/30 mpg. Both engines use premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nLike all good Scandinavian design, the S60’s interior is simple and functional. The materials have an upscale quality and look nice without trying too hard. The floating center stack, which has storage space carved out underneath it, was trimmed in aluminum and artistic to behold.\n\nThe center stack is also easy to use. The climate control system has an icon of a person on the center stack that makes warming up the different parts of your body easy. Are your feet cold? Press the icon’s feet to get warm air flowing to your tootsies. Your kids will think it’s nifty. My test car came with the optional Multimedia Package ($2,700) that includes navigation with voice control, an upgraded sound system and a backup camera.\n\nFor those of us with children, the five-seater’s sporty design and sedan-ness doesn’t make much room for little ones. This is a car that can handle only two child-safety seats at a time — no matter the type. To that point, only two average-sized adults can fit comfortably in the 60/40-split rear seats, though these sportier rear seats are not unusual in this entry-level turbocharged market. Think of them as a casualty of the stylish design and dominating need for speed.\n\nThere is no way I could take my family of five up to the mountains for a weekend in this car. Of course, that would force my husband and me to steal away in it on our own for a weekend, and that’s not such a bad thing.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nVolvo has all but bet its brand reputation on the premise of revolutionary safety, and the S60 is no exception. It almost goes without saying that the 2012 Volvo S60 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. To earn this safety award, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The 2012 S60 hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe S60 has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. In addition, the 2012 S60 comes with some standard perks such as rear seat belt monitors, which alert you if anyone in the second row has unbuckled their seat belt, and the Home Safe Lighting feature that uses the car’s headlights to illuminate your path right up to the front door. Even more exceptional is Volvo’s City Safety system that is standard on the S60. This system helps reduce the incidence and impact of rear-end collisions in traffic by automatically applying the brakes in a too-close situation if the driver does not.\n\nOptional safety features include the Pedestrian Detection system that will brake the car to avoid hitting any pedestrian taller than 31 inches should they wander in front of your car without you noticing. You can also opt for all-wheel drive, blind spot and lane departure warning systems, and a backup camera.\n\nThe only safety issue I was disappointed by was the S60’s lower Latch anchors. They were deeply embedded in the leather seats and took some maneuvering to access and use. Furthermore, thanks to the S60’s sexy design, the curvaceously slanted rear window is at such an angle that using the top tether anchor was tough. I was still able to install my child-safety seats, though. Given all the other great safety features in the S60, I don’t feel inclined to complain too much, but I’d love it if Volvo made them a little easier to use.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Volvo S60 here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolvo’s S60 sedan sits between the company’s entry-level S40 and the top-of-the-line S80; it competes with midsize luxury cars, including the Acura TL and Lincoln MKZ. Front- or all-wheel-drive models are available. Trims include the 2.5T, the all-wheel drive 2.5T and the T5. The T5 is the sportiest of the group; it gets a sport suspension.\n\nNew for 2009\nAll versions now come standard with an automatic transmission with manual shift functionality; more standard features have been added to each trim level.\n\nExterior\nA curvy shape, far removed from past Volvos, gives the four-door S60 the look of a coupe. The grille and bumper were redesigned in 2006, and they appear smoother and less angular than those of older S60s. The S60 is 181.2 inches long and 71 inches wide, which is smaller than its competitors.\n\nAvailable 16-, 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels\nStandard fog lights\nStandard power glass sunroof\nStandard power heated mirrors with memory function\nOptional headlight washers (standard on T5)\nOptional bi-xenon headlights with articulating headlamps (standard on T5)\nOptional rear park assist (standard on T5)\n\nInterior\nThe S60’s businesslike dashboard groups audio and climate controls within a broad center panel; it’s a design similar to the previous-generation S80. Up to five occupants fit inside the S60. A center tunnel console includes a storage bin and a flexible cupholder. A split, folding rear seat expands cargo capacity beyond the trunk’s 13.9 cubic feet; overall passenger space comes in at 94.3 cubic feet, which is smaller than the TL and MKZ. For 2009, power window switches have been revised.\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and seating surfaces\nStandard power passenger seat\nIn 2.5T, genuine wood inlays; T5 gets brushed aluminum inlays\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional 13-speaker surround-sound system with six-disc CD changer (standard on T5)\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth S60 inline-five-cylinder engines are turbocharged. The manual transmission option has been dropped for the S60, but the automatic now has a standard manual shift function.\n\nZero-to-60 acceleration ranges from 6.6 seconds in the T5 to 7.2 seconds in the AWD 2.5T, Volvo estimates. The front-wheel-drive 2.5T splits the difference at 6.9 seconds.\n\n208-horsepower, 2.5-liter turbocharged five-cylinder engine with 236 pounds-feet of torque (2.5T)\n257-hp, 2.4-liter turbocharged five-cylinder engine with 258 pounds-feet of torque (T5)\nStandard five-speed automatic transmission with manual shift functionality\nFront- or all-wheel-drive options\nOptional speed-sensitive steering (standard on T5)\nSport suspension on T5\n\nSafety\nFeatures include:\n\nStandard front, side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock brakes with electronic brake force distribution\nStandard electronic stability and traction control systems\nStandard security system\nStandard immobilizer-encrypted ignition key\nOptional rear park assist (standard on T5)",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2013 about the 2013 Volvo S60. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nVolvo used to be known as the safe luxury brand, but with models like the S60, it’s making a name for itself as the practical luxury brand — and the automaker should wave that banner proudly.\n\nThe S60 plays in a class with the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and in a rigorous comparison test we conducted recently (check out the $46,000 Sport Sedan Challenge here), Volvo finished in second place out of six, behind only the 328i. That S60, which was a T5, featured the base turbocharged five-cylinder engine that I reviewed earlier. We follow up that test with this evaluation of the up-level T6 R-Design trim level, which packs a more powerful turbocharged six-cylinder.\n\nThis is one of those circumstances where less is more; the unassuming T5 version of the 2013 Volvo S60 delivers just what you need while the T6 is truly too much of a good thing.\n\nPerformance\nThe T5 and T6 aren’t exactly night and day in terms of overall performance. In the T5, you get plenty of power from the turbocharged five-cylinder’s 250 horses. It was second to the BMW 328i in acceleration — especially in real-world driving scenarios — but the turbo is refined and delivers power smoothly.\n\nThere is also a 300-horsepower, turbocharged six-cylinder available for standard T6 models, as well as a 325-hp version for the T6 R-Design I tested. Both versions of the T6 are available only with all-wheel drive. The T5 comes with front- or optional all-wheel drive.\n\nMove all the way up to that R-Design and the twitchy accelerator pedal will have you jumping from a stop with a blast and otherwise feeling uncivilized. It’s fun to drive, of course, but it costs a hefty premium over the T5.\n\nThe T5 didn’t deliver confidence on the track during our comparison test, and the T6 R-Design doesn’t improve handling greatly. The T6 does have a much firmer ride, however, thanks to a sport-tuned suspension that also lowers the car more than a half-inch. The firmer ride turned off other editors, but I didn’t find it bone-crushing by any means. It will likely be an acceptable tradeoff for shoppers looking for that extra oomph under foot.\n\nPerhaps the reason some of our drivers objected to the T6 R-Design’s ride was the fact that the tamer T5’s comfortable ride stood out in our contest against the 328i M Sport, Mercedes C250 Sport, Audi A4 2.0T Quattro, Cadillac ATS 2.0T Performance and Acura TL 3.7. One editor said the T5 “rode marvelously.” So if your idea of luxury means comfort rather than a sports-car feel, the R-Design version is not the way to go.\n\nBraking was not a strength for the S60 during our tests, where the T5 came in second to last in 60 to zero mph runs. That was evident on the road, too. The brakes don’t sap confidence, but they’re clearly not on par with the 3 Series. The R-Design does get larger brakes for 2013, but I didn’t find them to be aggressive enough to match the added power under the hood.\n\nInterior\nAt this price, the S60’s interior is right where it should be in terms of luxury amenities, including comfortable leather seats and upscale finishes, like the metal door handles and thick steering wheel. The black-on-black interior was standard fare for the T6, while the T5 in our Challenge had optional Beachwood leather seats that were a deep tan color. The contrast with the rest of the black interior was an elegant look that impressed not only me, but was also a wow factor for the two consumers we selected to help us evaluate the competitors.\n\nThe backseat was also surprisingly comfortable and had a bit more room than others in this segment.\n\nWhile most editors found the S60 interior on par for the class, there are a few areas that need improving. The most glaring is the shifter. It features a clear plastic top that illuminates green at night for a dramatic effect. In the daytime, the result is less dramatic and more ugly.\n\nThe ergonomics were hit and miss. I liked the simplicity of the controls for climate, navigation and stereo functions, but many of the buttons and knobs were quite small. In an odd switch, the controls on the steering wheel were oversized when compared with most cars we test.\n\nAt 12 cubic feet, the S60’s trunk is just behind the A4 and C-Class, at 12.4, and the 3 Series, at 13 cubic feet. In practical use, it gives up little to any of those.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Volvo also excelled in our Challenge on the value front. You don’t often think “value” when shopping this class, but the S60 we tested came with all-wheel drive and the T5 powertrain, along with a competitive suite of features, for thousands of dollars less than the competition.\n\nFront-wheel-drive models start at $32,795 including an $895 destination charge. That beats the A4 and ATS by roughly $1,000 and the 328i and C250 by almost $5,000. You can compare the Volvo with the A4, 328i and C250 here. The S60 T5 that came in second in our comparison was $38,170 and featured all-wheel drive and an array of popular features.\n\nVolvo has come a long way in terms of the operation of its multimedia system. A simple knob, located in the traditional spot for a car stereo’s tuner knob, controls the 7-inch LCD screen. The outer ring cycles through selections, and one button inside the ring confirms choices and another backs you up if you make a mistake.\n\nSafety\nThe S60 earned the highest — and newly created — designation of Top Safety Pick+ from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That means it earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength tests, as well as in a new small-overlap frontal crash test.\n\nThe S60 also earned a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe S60 has a number of standard and optional safety systems that go beyond what many cars in the class offer. Not all of these have met with raves from our editors.\n\nCity Safety is a standard feature on all S60s that uses sensors to tell you if you’re approaching an obstacle or another car too quickly. It will actively pre-charge the brakes and apply them if it senses a collision is imminent. However, we’ve experienced the full force of the system activating when we pull into the parking garage outside our office. The single-bar gate has been enough to set off City Safety multiple times in every S60 we’ve tested since the feature came along.\n\nCollision Warning with pedestrian detection is a separate feature that’s optional. It uses radar and cameras instead of sensors to operate not only the adaptive cruise control, but also a braking system that can sense pedestrians walking in front of the car and apply the brakes automatically, much like City Safety.\n\nSee all the safety features listed on the Specifications page.\n\nVolvo S60 in the Market\nAfter enjoying the mass-market-friendly S60 T5, testing the T6 R-Design felt like over-indulgence. The S60 is an excellent all-around performer at an excellent price in the segment. It does so much right that, even though the R-Design doesn’t make that many missteps, we wonder to whom it will really speak.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2014 about the 2015 Volvo S60. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhile Volvo has built a reputation for safety, the 2015 S60 succeeds because it is a powerful, agile sedan.\n\nVolvo updated the S60’s styling last year, and the 2015 model gets a new family of drivetrains, dubbed Drive-E, that offer significantly better gas mileage and, according to Volvo, “increased driving pleasure.” To see the 2014 and 2015 S60 compared, click here.\n\nOur T6 Drive-E test car had the more powerful of the two new engines: a 302-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that uses a supercharger and a turbocharger. The car gets an EPA-estimated 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nThe base version of the S60 starts at $34,225 including a $925 destination charge, while the T6 Drive-E starts at $39,075. Optional features raised our car’s as-tested price to $47,725.\n\nExterior & Styling\nVolvo hasn’t made the most distinctive cars in the past, but the brand has been taking more design risks in recent years, coming out with more aggressive, unique styling. The S60 was one of the initial beneficiaries of that effort, but last year’s restyling replaced its visually interesting front-end with a new grille that’s wider but also more generic. Volvo design cues are still clearly evident from certain angles, like the rear, but there’s nothing about the new grille that’s distinctly Volvo.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S60 surprised me with its nimbleness and fun personality. The light-effort power steering is direct and the car changes course quickly. It’s a setup that rewards the driver, and it’s all the more refreshing at a time when steering systems are increasingly tuned to isolate the driver from the road — even among brands, like BMW, that are known for driving performance. Other luxury automakers could learn from what Volvo is doing here.\n\nWith the T6 Drive-E powertrain, the S60 is also quick. Whether you’re driving in the city or on the highway, the four-cylinder engine feels strong and pushes the car forward rapidly when you’re liberal with the gas pedal. If you didn’t know what was under the hood, you’d probably conclude the car had a turbocharged six-cylinder.\n\nThank the T6 Drive-E’s unique induction technology for the four-cylinder engine’s robust, seamless power. A supercharger builds power at low engine rpm while a turbocharger spools up at higher engine speeds. Fuel-saving stop-start technology is standard, and while the Volvo’s was no worse than similar systems from other automakers, this feature annoys me, so I mostly drove with it off.\n\nA new eight-speed automatic transmission is the other part of the Drive-E formula. It drives the front wheels, but even with the high-output four-cylinder engine I didn’t notice any torque steer. (Another editor, however, did.)\n\nThe automatic upshifts smoothly, and in higher gears engine rpm is so low you barely hear the four-cylinder. When you need more power, it’s easy to make the transmission kick down a gear by nudging the gas pedal.\n\nOur S60 had optional 19-inch wheels and Volvo’s Sport Chassis, which includes a front strut-tower brace, 15-mm shorter front springs and monotube rear shocks. The firm suspension tuning communicates bumps large and small. The resulting ride quality is busy, but I never walked away from the S60 feeling sore. The car stays relatively flat when cornering but doesn’t feel particularly athletic, and it doesn’t urge you to go faster, like the BMW 3 Series will.\n\nThe one glaring problem with the S60 driving experience is its non-linear brake-pedal response, which is reminiscent of some gas/electric hybrids. Making a smooth stop requires extra concentration.\n\nInterior\nThe S60’s interior has premium materials, and fit-and-finish is good, but it’s not very luxurious-looking; the dashboard is plain apart from a few flourishes, like a thin center control panel and an optional digital instrument panel. Our test car’s dreary gray color scheme didn’t help matters. Volvo offers black and beige interiors, too.\n\nFront-seat comfort is good. The bucket seats are soft, but the side bolsters hold you firmly in place in fast corners. A wheel on the backrest adjusts the manual lumbar support.\n\nThe backseat is similar in size to the 3 Series’. Headroom is good, and the outboard seats are comfortable, but I could have used more legroom. The backs of the front seats are indented, which gives your knees some extra space.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nVolvo’s multimedia system has a knob on the right side of the center control panel that you use to make selections, along with system-specific buttons to its left. It doesn’t take long to get the hang of things, but it’s not as intuitive as a good touch-screen system, like Chrysler’s Uconnect. Some of the S60’s on-screen menus include brief instructions for performing commands. This is helpful, but it also seems like an acknowledgement that the interface could be better.\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard. My iPhone paired easily with the car, which showed recent calls and had no trouble playing music stored on the phone. However, it didn’t download my contacts when I asked it to. Other automakers’ multimedia systems haven’t had a problem getting this information from my phone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage room up front includes door pockets that can fit smaller items, a shelf behind the center control panel, two sturdy-looking cupholders in the center console and, behind them, a deep, square-shaped storage bin.\n\nThe S60 has a standard 60/40-split folding backseat with a trunk pass-through. There’s a small ledge between the folded seats and the cargo floor, but Volvo accounts for it with a built-in ramp in the trunk floor. Most automakers don’t. The floor can also have a flip-up divider with a strap for holding grocery bags or other cargo.\n\nThe trunk measures 12 cubic feet, which is slightly smaller than what the Audi A4 (12.4), Infiniti Q50 (13.5) and BMW 328i (13) offer. (To see these cars’ specs compared, click here.)\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 S60 received a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The 2014 version of the car received a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the 2015 model will also get this rating.\n\nThe S60 comes standard with City Safety, a system designed to prevent or lessen the severity of a low-speed collision with a car in front of you. Depending on the S60’s closing speed, the system can ready the brakes or automatically brake the car. A backup camera is optional.\n\nA number of advanced safety features are bundled in two packages. The $900 Blind Spot Information System Package includes a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors. The $1,500 Technology Package adds adaptive cruise control, collision warning with automatic braking, pedestrian and cyclist detection with automatic braking, lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nYou’re constantly aware of these safety systems when driving in urban traffic. You’ll see the door-mounted light for the blind spot warning system out of the corner of your eye as cars approach, and the dashboard-mounted collision warning light glows dimly when you’re following another car closely.\n\nOur past experience with Volvo’s automatic-braking systems hasn’t been great; the gates at the parking garage where we park our test cars consistently triggered automatic braking in two previous S60 model years. I didn’t experience that with the 2015 version, but two of our editors did. I inched slowly toward the gate when entering and leaving the garage, however.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the S60, see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIf you’ve priced out a luxury car lately, one of the things you’ve probably noticed is how fast the price rises when you start checking the boxes for optional features. The S60 isn’t immune to this phenomenon, but its as-tested price of $47,725 gets you a car that’s very well-equipped and costs thousands of dollars less than a similarly configured Q50 or 3 Series. Volvo might not have the cachet of a BMW, but it feels like you get a lot for your money with this car. That’s the kind of distinction I’ll readily embrace.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolvos front-wheel-drive S60 sedan is slotted between the companys entry-level S40 and top-of-the-line S80; it was launched for the 2000 model year. Based on the S80s platform, the S60 bears a family resemblance but is shorter in wheelbase and overall length. An all-wheel-drive (AWD) model joined the S60 sedan lineup in 2002.\n\nFor 2004, a 208-horsepower, 2.5-liter light-pressure-turbocharged five-cylinder replaces the prior 197-hp 2.4-liter engine. A less-potent 2.4-liter five-cylinder serves as the base engine, while the turbocharged 2.3-liter in the T5 edition produces 247 hp. The mirrors have been redesigned to reduce wind noise, new 15-inch alloy wheels are installed, and new ZF rack-and-pinion steering is used. A new instrument panel features watch-bezel gauge surrounds, and the flip-style key has integrated remote control.\n\nVolvo introduced a high-performance S60 R sedan and a comparable V70 R wagon at the Paris Motor Show in September 2002. Ford Motor Co. owns the Swedish automaker.\n\nExterior\nA surprisingly curvy shape for a Volvo gives the four-door S60 the look of a coupe. In fact, Volvo calls it a coupe with four doors. Styling themes include a low hood, sloping rear roof pillars, and short front and rear overhangs. Volvos hallmark square grille is more compact in this installation; it is flanked by aerodynamic headlights.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit inside the S60. A split, folding rear seat expands cargo capacity beyond the trunks 13.9 cubic feet. Standard equipment includes power windows with automatic up/down operation, a CD/cassette player, a tilt/telescoping steering column, dual-zone air conditioning and a remote keyless entry system. Leather upholstery is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour inline-five-cylinder engines are available for regular S60 sedans. A 2.4-liter produces 168 hp in the 2.4 model, while a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine develops 208 hp in the 2.5T and 2.5T AWD. Farther up the performance scale is the T5s 247-hp, turbocharged 2.3-liter, which drives a five-speed manual or optional Geartronic five-speed-automatic transmission. Buyers can choose a manual shift or a regular five-speed automatic with the 168-hp engine. The 208-hp inline-five comes only with automatic, but a Geartronic transmission that includes a manual-shifting provision is available.\n\nSafety\nVolvos comprehensive safety package includes side-impact airbags and whiplash protection for the front passengers, side curtain-type airbags that protect front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes. Volvos Dynamic Stability Traction Control electronic stability system is standard on the T5 and optional on other S60 sedans.\n\nS60 R\nBuilt for high-performance operation, the S60 R sedan holds a 300-hp engine and features a Four-C adaptive chassis, along with Servotronic steering, Brembo brakes and Haldex all-wheel drive. The S60 R went into limited production early in 2003 as a 2004 model. Both the S60 R and a comparable V70 R wagon were introduced to the U.S. market at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2003.\n\nThe 2004 S60 Rs 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine produces 300 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque; it drives either a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission. Three driving modes are available: Comfort, Sport and Advanced Sport.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSuperior construction tops the list of S60 attributes, and refinement is the next word that comes to mind. The turbocharged engines are quiet and produce eager and energetic performance, albeit in a modest manner. Even though the S60 rides smooth most of the time, it lets quite a few road imperfections get through to occupants because of an undeniably taut suspension. But the driver feels in complete control.\n\nThe tires adhere smartly to the pavement. Confident steering demands some effort, so this isnt a car that can be driven lazily. Automatic-transmission response varies from smooth to a bit abrupt, depending on the throttle position and road speed.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolvo’s S60 sedan slots between the company’s entry-level S40 and top-of-the-line S80. Based on the S80’s platform, the S60 bears a family resemblance but is shorter. An all-wheel-drive model is available.\n\nA high-performance S60 R sedan that featured a Four-C adaptive chassis and a 300-horsepower engine debuted in 2004.\n(Skip to details on the: S60 R)\n\nFor 2005, the T5’s engine got an additional 10 hp, for a total of 257 hp. The T5 also gained a standard sport suspension and could be equipped with 17- or 18-inch wheels. Volvo’s Four-C chassis became optional on all turbocharged models and standard on the R. Exterior freshening included body-colored moldings and a softened front nose.\n\nThe non-turbocharged 2.4 sedan will disappear in 2006, leaving the 2.5T model, the T5 and the R. Volvo has modified the S60’s option selection, dropping such stand-alone items as the moonroof, leather seating surfaces and rear park assist. A new Instant Traction system is installed in 2.5T AWD models. Volvo says it instantly sends up to 50 percent more torque to the rear wheels when necessary.\n\nOnly the T5 can be equipped with the Four-C chassis and Sport Body Package as stand-alone options. The Touring Package for the 2.5T AWD is gone. A new Convenience Package includes rear park assist and laminated side windows. Volvo is owned by Ford Motor Co.\n\nExterior\nA curvy shape, far removed from past Volvos, gives the four-door S60 the look of a coupe. Styling elements include a low hood, sloping rear roof pillars, and short front and rear overhangs. Volvo’s hallmark square grille is more compact in this installation and is flanked by aerodynamic headlights. The optional Sport Body Package adds color-coordinated front and rear spoilers and lower body side sills.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants fit inside the S60. A split, folding rear seat expands cargo capacity beyond the trunk’s 13.9 cubic feet. A center tunnel includes a storage bin and flexible cupholder. Second-generation seats “are designed around orthopedic principles,” according to Volvo.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows, a CD player, a tilt/telescoping steering column and a remote keyless entry system. Leather upholstery is available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll S60 inline-five-cylinder engines are now turbocharged. A 2.5-liter develops 208 hp in the 2.5T and 2.5T AWD. The T5’s 257-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter drives a six-speed manual or an optional Geartronic five-speed-automatic transmission. Both 2.5T models come only with a five-speed automatic, but Geartronic operation is optional.\n\nSafety\nVolvo’s safety package for the S60 includes standard side-impact airbags and whiplash protection for front occupants, side curtain-type airbags that protect front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes. Dynamic Stability and Traction Control is standard on the T5 and R models and optional on 2.5T sedans.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSuperior construction tops the list of S60 attributes, followed by refinement. Turbocharged engines are quiet and produce eager and energetic performance, albeit modestly. Even though the S60 rides smoothly most of the time, its taut suspension lets quite a few road imperfections get through to occupants. Still, the driver feels in complete control.\n\nThe tires adhere smartly to the pavement. Confident steering demands some effort, so this isn’t a car that can be driven lazily. Automatic-transmission response varies from smooth to a bit abrupt, depending on throttle position and road speed.�\n\nS60 R\nBuilt for high-performance operation, the S60 R sedan holds a 300-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder that drives a six-speed-manual transmission. Features include a Four-C adaptive chassis, Servotronic steering, Brembo brakes and Haldex all-wheel drive. Three driving modes are available: Comfort, Sport and Advanced Sport.\n\nFor 2006, a six-speed-automatic transmission with Geartronic operation is optional. A Convenience Package replaces the prior Touring Package, and the new all-wheel-drive system features Instant Traction. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "While Volvo has built a reputation for safety, the 2015 S60 succeeds because it is a powerful, agile sedan.\n\nVolvo updated the S60’s styling last year, and the 2015 model gets a new family of drivetrains, dubbed Drive-E, that offer significantly better gas mileage and, according to Volvo, “increased driving pleasure.” To see the 2014 and 2015 S60 compared, click here.\n\nOur T6 Drive-E test car had the more powerful of the two new engines: a 302-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that uses a supercharger and a turbocharger. The car gets an EPA-estimated 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nThe base version of the S60 starts at $34,225 including a $925 destination charge, while the T6 Drive-E starts at $39,075. Optional features raised our car’s as-tested price to $47,725.\n\nExterior & Styling\nVolvo hasn’t made the most distinctive cars in the past, but the brand has been taking more design risks in recent years, coming out with more aggressive, unique styling. The S60 was one of the initial beneficiaries of that effort, but last year’s restyling replaced its visually interesting front-end with a new grille that’s wider but also more generic. Volvo design cues are still clearly evident from certain angles, like the rear, but there’s nothing about the new grille that’s distinctly Volvo.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S60 surprised me with its nimbleness and fun personality. The light-effort power steering is direct and the car changes course quickly. It’s a setup that rewards the driver, and it’s all the more refreshing at a time when steering systems are increasingly tuned to isolate the driver from the road — even among brands, like BMW, that are known for driving performance. Other luxury automakers could learn from what Volvo is doing here.\n\nWith the T6 Drive-E powertrain, the S60 is also quick. Whether you’re driving in the city or on the highway, the four-cylinder engine feels strong and pushes the car forward rapidly when you’re liberal with the gas pedal. If you didn’t know what was under the hood, you’d probably conclude the car had a turbocharged six-cylinder.\n\nThank the T6 Drive-E’s unique induction technology for the four-cylinder engine’s robust, seamless power. A supercharger builds power at low engine rpm while a turbocharger spools up at higher engine speeds. Fuel-saving stop-start technology is standard, and while the Volvo’s was no worse than similar systems from other automakers, this feature annoys me, so I mostly drove with it off.\n\nA new eight-speed automatic transmission is the other part of the Drive-E formula. It drives the front wheels, but even with the high-output four-cylinder engine I didn’t notice any torque steer. (Another editor, however, did.)\n\nThe automatic upshifts smoothly, and in higher gears engine rpm is so low you barely hear the four-cylinder. When you need more power, it’s easy to make the transmission kick down a gear by nudging the gas pedal.\n\nOur S60 had optional 19-inch wheels and Volvo’s Sport Chassis, which includes a front strut-tower brace, 15-mm shorter front springs and monotube rear shocks. The firm suspension tuning communicates bumps large and small. The resulting ride quality is busy, but I never walked away from the S60 feeling sore. The car stays relatively flat when cornering but doesn’t feel particularly athletic, and it doesn’t urge you to go faster, like the BMW 3 Series will.\n\nThe one glaring problem with the S60 driving experience is its non-linear brake-pedal response, which is reminiscent of some gas/electric hybrids. Making a smooth stop requires extra concentration.\n\nInterior\nThe S60’s interior has premium materials, and fit-and-finish is good, but it’s not very luxurious-looking; the dashboard is plain apart from a few flourishes, like a thin center control panel and an optional digital instrument panel. Our test car’s dreary gray color scheme didn’t help matters. Volvo offers black and beige interiors, too.\n\nFront-seat comfort is good. The bucket seats are soft, but the side bolsters hold you firmly in place in fast corners. A wheel on the backrest adjusts the manual lumbar support.\n\nThe backseat is similar in size to the 3 Series’. Headroom is good, and the outboard seats are comfortable, but I could have used more legroom. The backs of the front seats are indented, which gives your knees some extra space.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nVolvo’s multimedia system has a knob on the right side of the center control panel that you use to make selections, along with system-specific buttons to its left. It doesn’t take long to get the hang of things, but it’s not as intuitive as a good touch-screen system, like Chrysler’s Uconnect. Some of the S60’s on-screen menus include brief instructions for performing commands. This is helpful, but it also seems like an acknowledgement that the interface could be better.\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard. My iPhone paired easily with the car, which showed recent calls and had no trouble playing music stored on the phone. However, it didn’t download my contacts when I asked it to. Other automakers’ multimedia systems haven’t had a problem getting this information from my phone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage room up front includes door pockets that can fit smaller items, a shelf behind the center control panel, two sturdy-looking cupholders in the center console and, behind them, a deep, square-shaped storage bin.\n\nThe S60 has a standard 60/40-split folding backseat with a trunk pass-through. There’s a small ledge between the folded seats and the cargo floor, but Volvo accounts for it with a built-in ramp in the trunk floor. Most automakers don’t. The floor can also have a flip-up divider with a strap for holding grocery bags or other cargo.\n\nThe trunk measures 12 cubic feet, which is slightly smaller than what the Audi A4 (12.4), Infiniti Q50 (13.5) and BMW 328i (13) offer. (To see these cars’ specs compared, click here.)\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 S60 received a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The 2014 version of the car received a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the 2015 model will also get this rating.\n\nThe S60 comes standard with City Safety, a system designed to prevent or lessen the severity of a low-speed collision with a car in front of you. Depending on the S60’s closing speed, the system can ready the brakes or automatically brake the car. A backup camera is optional.\n\nA number of advanced safety features are bundled in two packages. The $900 Blind Spot Information System Package includes a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors. The $1,500 Technology Package adds adaptive cruise control, collision warning with automatic braking, pedestrian and cyclist detection with automatic braking, lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nYou’re constantly aware of these safety systems when driving in urban traffic. You’ll see the door-mounted light for the blind spot warning system out of the corner of your eye as cars approach, and the dashboard-mounted collision warning light glows dimly when you’re following another car closely.\n\nOur past experience with Volvo’s automatic-braking systems hasn’t been great; the gates at the parking garage where we park our test cars consistently triggered automatic braking in two previous S60 model years. I didn’t experience that with the 2015 version, but two of our editors did. I inched slowly toward the gate when entering and leaving the garage, however.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the S60, see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIf you’ve priced out a luxury car lately, one of the things you’ve probably noticed is how fast the price rises when you start checking the boxes for optional features. The S60 isn’t immune to this phenomenon, but its as-tested price of $47,725 gets you a car that’s very well-equipped and costs thousands of dollars less than a similarly configured Q50 or 3 Series. Volvo might not have the cachet of a BMW, but it feels like you get a lot for your money with this car. That’s the kind of distinction I’ll readily embrace.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Volvo used to be known as the safe luxury brand, but with models like the S60, it’s making a name for itself as the practical luxury brand — and the automaker should wave that banner proudly.\n\nThe S60 plays in a class with the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and in a rigorous comparison test we conducted recently (check out the $46,000 Sport Sedan Challenge here), Volvo finished in second place out of six, behind only the 328i. That S60, which was a T5, featured the base turbocharged five-cylinder engine that I reviewed earlier. We follow up that test with this evaluation of the up-level T6 R-Design trim level, which packs a more powerful turbocharged six-cylinder.\n\nThis is one of those circumstances where less is more; the unassuming T5 version of the 2013 Volvo S60 delivers just what you need while the T6 is truly too much of a good thing.\n\nPerformance\nThe T5 and T6 aren’t exactly night and day in terms of overall performance. In the T5, you get plenty of power from the turbocharged five-cylinder’s 250 horses. It was second to the BMW 328i in acceleration — especially in real-world driving scenarios — but the turbo is refined and delivers power smoothly.\n\nThere is also a 300-horsepower, turbocharged six-cylinder available for standard T6 models, as well as a 325-hp version for the T6 R-Design I tested. Both versions of the T6 are available only with all-wheel drive. The T5 comes with front- or optional all-wheel drive.\n\nMove all the way up to that R-Design and the twitchy accelerator pedal will have you jumping from a stop with a blast and otherwise feeling uncivilized. It’s fun to drive, of course, but it costs a hefty premium over the T5.\n\nThe T5 didn’t deliver confidence on the track during our comparison test, and the T6 R-Design doesn’t improve handling greatly. The T6 does have a much firmer ride, however, thanks to a sport-tuned suspension that also lowers the car more than a half-inch. The firmer ride turned off other editors, but I didn’t find it bone-crushing by any means. It will likely be an acceptable tradeoff for shoppers looking for that extra oomph under foot.\n\nPerhaps the reason some of our drivers objected to the T6 R-Design’s ride was the fact that the tamer T5’s comfortable ride stood out in our contest against the 328i M Sport, Mercedes C250 Sport, Audi A4 2.0T Quattro, Cadillac ATS 2.0T Performance and Acura TL 3.7. One editor said the T5 “rode marvelously.” So if your idea of luxury means comfort rather than a sports-car feel, the R-Design version is not the way to go.\n\nBraking was not a strength for the S60 during our tests, where the T5 came in second to last in 60 to zero mph runs. That was evident on the road, too. The brakes don’t sap confidence, but they’re clearly not on par with the 3 Series. The R-Design does get larger brakes for 2013, but I didn’t find them to be aggressive enough to match the added power under the hood.\n\nInterior\nAt this price, the S60’s interior is right where it should be in terms of luxury amenities, including comfortable leather seats and upscale finishes, like the metal door handles and thick steering wheel. The black-on-black interior was standard fare for the T6, while the T5 in our Challenge had optional Beachwood leather seats that were a deep tan color. The contrast with the rest of the black interior was an elegant look that impressed not only me, but was also a wow factor for the two consumers we selected to help us evaluate the competitors.\n\nThe backseat was also surprisingly comfortable and had a bit more room than others in this segment.\n\nWhile most editors found the S60 interior on par for the class, there are a few areas that need improving. The most glaring is the shifter. It features a clear plastic top that illuminates green at night for a dramatic effect. In the daytime, the result is less dramatic and more ugly.\n\nThe ergonomics were hit and miss. I liked the simplicity of the controls for climate, navigation and stereo functions, but many of the buttons and knobs were quite small. In an odd switch, the controls on the steering wheel were oversized when compared with most cars we test.\n\nAt 12 cubic feet, the S60’s trunk is just behind the A4 and C-Class, at 12.4, and the 3 Series, at 13 cubic feet. In practical use, it gives up little to any of those.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Volvo also excelled in our Challenge on the value front. You don’t often think “value” when shopping this class, but the S60 we tested came with all-wheel drive and the T5 powertrain, along with a competitive suite of features, for thousands of dollars less than the competition.\n\nFront-wheel-drive models start at $32,795 including an $895 destination charge. That beats the A4 and ATS by roughly $1,000 and the 328i and C250 by almost $5,000. You can compare the Volvo with the A4, 328i and C250 here. The S60 T5 that came in second in our comparison was $38,170 and featured all-wheel drive and an array of popular features.\n\nVolvo has come a long way in terms of the operation of its multimedia system. A simple knob, located in the traditional spot for a car stereo’s tuner knob, controls the 7-inch LCD screen. The outer ring cycles through selections, and one button inside the ring confirms choices and another backs you up if you make a mistake.\n\nSafety\nThe S60 earned the highest — and newly created — designation of Top Safety Pick+ from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That means it earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength tests, as well as in a new small-overlap frontal crash test.\n\nThe S60 also earned a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe S60 has a number of standard and optional safety systems that go beyond what many cars in the class offer. Not all of these have met with raves from our editors.\n\nCity Safety is a standard feature on all S60s that uses sensors to tell you if you’re approaching an obstacle or another car too quickly. It will actively pre-charge the brakes and apply them if it senses a collision is imminent. However, we’ve experienced the full force of the system activating when we pull into the parking garage outside our office. The single-bar gate has been enough to set off City Safety multiple times in every S60 we’ve tested since the feature came along.\n\nCollision Warning with pedestrian detection is a separate feature that’s optional. It uses radar and cameras instead of sensors to operate not only the adaptive cruise control, but also a braking system that can sense pedestrians walking in front of the car and apply the brakes automatically, much like City Safety.\n\nSee all the safety features listed on the Specifications page.\n\nVolvo S60 in the Market\nAfter enjoying the mass-market-friendly S60 T5, testing the T6 R-Design felt like over-indulgence. The S60 is an excellent all-around performer at an excellent price in the segment. It does so much right that, even though the R-Design doesn’t make that many missteps, we wonder to whom it will really speak.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nVolvo’s S60 sedan slots between the company’s entry-level S40 and top-of-the-line S80. An all-wheel-drive model is available. For 2007, the S60 gets a new front grille and bumper design, plus a variety of other changes including a firmer suspension and anti-roll bars. Volvo’s electronic stability control system is newly standard for all S60s.\n\nA high-performance S60 R sedan that features a 300-horsepower engine is also available.\n(Skip to details on the: S60 R)\n\nThe 257-hp T5 has a standard sport suspension and, like all S60s, can be equipped with 17- or 18-inch wheels.\n\nVolvo modified the S60’s option selection for 2007, dropping such items as puddle lights and the Solid Black paint scheme and replacing the Ruby Red exterior color option with Passion Red.\n\nExterior\nA curvy shape, far removed from past Volvos, gives the four-door S60 the look of a coupe. The grille and bumper have been redesigned and appear smoother and less angular than the 2006 model and many Volvos of the past. The grille has been altered to appear more rectangular, but with round, smooth corners. The overall effect is subtle, but Volvo fans would be able to spot the difference between 2007 and 2006 models parked next to each other.\n\nThere are also new standalone options, including metallic paint and a choice of 17- or 18-inch wheels, the former available with run-flat tires. The outboard mirrors have integrated turn signals.\n\nInterior\nVolvo adds aluminum inserts to column stalks and steering wheel switches for 2007. There’s also a Sport Package that includes an upgraded six-CD stereo, and the Convenience Package adds a compass to the rearview mirror.\n\nUp to five occupants fit inside the S60. A split, folding rear seat expands cargo capacity beyond the trunk’s 13.9 cubic feet. A center tunnel includes a storage bin and flexible cupholder. Second-generation seats “are designed around orthopedic principles,” according to Volvo.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows, a CD player, a tilt/telescoping steering column and a remote keyless entry system. Leather upholstery is available.\n\nNew standalone options include a wood steering wheel for 2.5T models, a DVD-based navigation system and an interior air quality sensor.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll S60 inline-five-cylinder engines are turbocharged. A 2.5-liter develops 208 hp in the 2.5T and 2.5T AWD. The T5’s 257-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter drives a six-speed manual or an optional Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission. Both 2.5T models come only with a five-speed automatic, but Geartronic operation is optional. The shock absorbers and springs have been retuned to be stiffer, and the anti-roll bars are also stiffer and have solid bushings for 2007.\n\nSafety\nVolvo’s safety package for the S60 includes standard side-impact airbags and whiplash protection for front occupants, side curtain airbags that protect front and rear occupants, and antilock brakes. Electronic stability control is standard on all S60s, and the switch to engage the system has been moved to the steering wheel stalk.\n\nS60 R\nBuilt for high-performance operation, the S60 R sedan holds a 300-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder that drives a six-speed manual transmission. Features include a Four-C adaptive chassis, Servotronic steering, Brembo brakes and Haldex all-wheel drive. Three driving modes are available: Comfort, Sport and Advanced Sport.\n\nFor 2007, the R features a redesigned grille and bumper to improve aerodynamics, and an optional Sport Body Package features new front and rear spoilers and lower side sills. Revised rearview mirrors include integrated turn signals. Convenience features include a compass in the rearview mirror and a grocery bag holder. Back to top",
