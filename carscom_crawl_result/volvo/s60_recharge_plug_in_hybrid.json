      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe Volvo S60 is a five-seat luxury sedan that competes with the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Power comes from a 247-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. Volvo also sells a Recharge plug-in hybrid version of the S60 that generates 455 hp and comes standard with AWD. The S60 Recharge can travel up to 41 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe S60 sees only minor changes for 2024. In addition to some trim and feature-availability tweaks, the Recharge’s performance-oriented Polestar Engineered trim has been discontinued, and the non-hybrid S60’s line-topping Ultimate trim now comes standard with AWD.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo S60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nFront-wheel drive\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n9-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower moonroof\nPower-folding side mirrors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFoglights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver attention monitor\nRear parking sensors\nRemote keyless entry with push-button start\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nImitation leather upholstery\nPower front seats with lumbar support\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAll-wheel drive\nHeated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRemote start\nUpgraded Harman Kardon audio system\nHead-up display\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLeather seating surfaces\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nNavigation\n360-degree camera\nFront camera\nCruise-control steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo S60?\n\nThe S60 is a stylish alternative to traditional entry-level luxury sedans, with a distinctively classy character and exceptional everyday comfort. The plug-in hybrid is surprisingly powerful and offers excellent electric-only range. The S60’s driving experience, however, may not meet enthusiasts’ standards, and passengers don’t have a lot of extra space.",
