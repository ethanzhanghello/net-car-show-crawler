      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Volvo V60?\n\nConsider the Volvo V60 luxury wagon the anti-SUV for shoppers who need extra space but don’t care for an off-road image. With its sleek design and newly available plug-in hybrid powertrain, this five-seater isn’t like the wagons of yesterday.\n\nBased on the same platform as the S60 sedan and XC60 SUV, the front-wheel-drive V60 is powered by a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The plug-in hybrid model makes 415 total hp and has all-wheel drive. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Volvo V60?\n\nThe new Polestar Engineered plug-in hybrid variant features a turbocharged and supercharged engine and can travel up to 22 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates. Other features include adjustable shock absorbers, Brembo brakes with gold calipers, black-chrome exhaust pipes, gold seat belts and a Bowers & Wilkins premium stereo. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Volvo V60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include a digital instrument panel with a 12.3-inch screen, navigation, LED headlights, a power liftgate, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and a panoramic moonroof with a power sunshade. Standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Volvo V60?\n\nWith plenty of storage and cargo space, the V60 is a practical, versatile luxury car. Occupant space is limited, however, and its handling is unremarkable. The Polestar Engineered’s power is impressive, but it’s also significantly more expensive than the regular V60.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nThe Volvo V60 is a luxury wagon with seating for five, offering more interior room than a sedan without the added height and bulk of an SUV. Cross Country versions are powered by a 247-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The V60 Recharge Polestar Engineered has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combines a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with two electric motors for a total of 455 hp, as well as performance-oriented trim and suspension tuning. All-wheel drive is standard on all V60 variants, and competitors include the Audi A4 Allroad and Subaru Outback.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nThe 2024 V60 lineup is mostly unchanged. Vapour Grey paint replaces Black Stone, and a power liftgate and cabin filter are now standard on all trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volvo V60 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n18-inch wheels\n9-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nGoogle Built-In infotainment system\nAudio system with 10 speakers\nWi-Fi hotspot\nAutomatic headlights and high beams\nAdaptive self-leveling headlights\nFoglamps\nCornering lights\nPower-folding heated side mirrors\nRain-sensing wipers\nPower moonroof\n60/40-split, folding rear seatbacks\nWood and aluminum interior trim\nManual tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nRemote keyless entry\nPush-button start\nLeather seating surfaces\nPower heated front seats with lumbar adjustment\nRemote start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go\nCollision mitigation front and rear\nLane departure warning with lane departure steering assist\nPark assist front and rear\nDriver attention monitor\nFront camera\n360-degree camera\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19-inch wheels\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nHeadlight washers\nUpgraded Harman Kardon audio system\nHead-up display\nVentilated seats\nPerforated Nappa leather seating surfaces\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volvo V60?\n\nWith plenty of storage and cargo space, the V60 Cross Country is a practical, versatile luxury wagon.
