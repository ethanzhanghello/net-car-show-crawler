      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe EX30, EX40 and EX90 all-electric SUVs get updates for the 2026 model year.\nSingle Motor versions of the EX30 and EX90 are now available, as well as the EX30’s new Cross Country variant.\nA Black Edition Package is now optional for the EX40.\n\nWith the federal EV tax credit having expired, the future of the EV market in the U.S. is mired in uncertainty. Nevertheless, Volvo is forging ahead with myriad updates to its electric lineup for the 2026 model year with updates big and small for all three of its electric SUVs: the three-row EX90, small EX40 and smaller EX30.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volvo EX30 Review: Minimalist Interior, Maximum Power\n\nBiggest Changes for Largest EV\n\nWe already knew about the EX90’s new 800-volt electrical architecture, which will allow for faster charging, greater efficiency and more power (up to 670 horsepower in the Twin Motor Performance, making it what Volvo claims is the most powerful car it’s ever offered). Now, the brand has announced it will bring a rear-wheel-drive EX90 Single Motor version to market.\n\nThe company hasn’t shared further details on the variant yet, but if it applies the same strategy to the Single Motor as it previously did to the Twin Motor and Twin Motor Performance versions, the rear-drive EX90 will be available in both the Plus and Ultra trim levels, allowing buyers to separately choose their powertrain and the package of luxury and tech features in their electric Volvo SUV. The Single Motor should be a bit cheaper than the Twin Motor, too, which could allow buyers to get a top-spec Single Motor for a price similar to — or less than — that of an entry-level Twin Motor.\n\nTwo New EX30s\n\nSimilarly, the subcompact EX30 gains a new Single Motor variant for 2026 — and we do know the pricing for this one. It starts at $38,950 (including the destination charge), $6,000 less than the Twin Motor. The RWD Single Motor generates 268 hp versus 422 hp for the Twin Motor Performance, previously the only EX30 powertrain available. Its EPA-rated 261 miles of range only tops that of the Twin by 8 miles, but cargo capacity swells from 12.4 to 27.8 cubic feet, per Volvo’s measurements.\n\nAt the other end of the EX30 lineup is the new Cross Country model. Applying the same philosophy as Volvo’s gas-burning V60 and V90 Cross Country wagons, the EX30 version gets higher ground clearance and black lower-body cladding and extended wheel arches. It’s also distinguished from other EX30s by a panel on the front bumper that’s etched with a topographical map of northern Sweden’s Kebnekaise mountain range. Only available with the Twin Motor Ultra trim, it costs $49,445.\n\nRead More Volvo EV News Coverage on Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2025 Volvo EX90 a Good Electric SUV? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Volvo EX90?\nVolvo ES90: An All-Electric Sedan With Up to 670 HP\nHow Much Is the 2025 Volvo EX40?\nPolestar and Volvo EV Drivers Can Now Use Tesla Superchargers\nA Little Something for the EX40\n\nNot to be left out, the EX40 gains a new Black Edition Package for 2026. Other Volvos have been available in Black Edition form, but the EX40 is the first time it’s been offered on a pure EV. As on those vehicles, the EX40 Black Edition sports black wheels, exterior trim and badging. It’s limited to the Onyx Black, Crystal White, Vapour Grey and Denim Blue exterior colors.\n\nIn the absence of federal incentives to hit its electrification target, Volvo will have to rely on broadening the appeal of its electric lineup. These look like solid first steps.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The electric version of Volvo’s XC40 is getting a rebranding for the 2025 model year along with the rest of the brand’s electric lineup. Formerly known as the XC40 Recharge, the compact electric SUV now goes by EX40. But with the only other change for 2025 being a slightly larger battery pack for the dual-motor variant (it’s now the same 82 kilowatt-hours as the single motor versus the 2024 model’s 78) and a DC fast-charging capacity that inches up from 200 kilowatts to 205, the Volvo EV just adds to everything we already liked about it.\n\nRelated: Is the 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin a Good SUV? 7 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Volvo EX40 is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,295 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nCore: $53,795\nPlus: $56,595\nUltra: $60,295\nWhat Are the 2025 EX40’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe 2025 Volvo EX40 is available in three trim levels: Core, Plus and Ultra. Standard equipment on the entry-level Core trim includes 19-inch wheels, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The seats, which are heated in front with power adjustments for the driver, are upholstered in synthetic leather with cloth trim. Other interior features include dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless device charging, eight speakers, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 9-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The EX40 Core’s roster of safety tech includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, oncoming traffic alert, road-sign recognition and rear parking sensors.\n\nOne step up, the Plus adds a panoramic moonroof, synthetic suede seats with faux leather trim, a power-adjustable passenger seat and more safety tech, including a 360-degree camera system and front, side and rear parking sensors.\n\nOpt for the Ultra and you’ll get 20-inch wheels, a black roof, upgraded headlights, a heat pump for more efficient climate control, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and a 13-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. The Ultra also gains yet more driver-assistance features, including adaptive cruise control with stop and go, as well as Volvo’s Pilot Assist hands-on highway semi-autonomous system that integrates the adaptive cruise and lane-centering steering functions.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 EX40’s Powertrain Specs and Range?\n\nA single electric motor is standard on all three of the EX40’s trim levels. Driving the rear wheels, it makes 248 horsepower and 310 pounds-feet of torque. Available for just $1,750 on every trim, the Dual Motor setup is perhaps the cheapest horsepower on the market today; it adds a motor to the front axle, making the EX40 all-wheel drive and lofting output to a total of 402 hp and 494 pounds-feet of torque. That drops acceleration from 0-60 mph from a claimed 6.9 seconds for the Single Motor powertrain to 4.6 for the Dual Motor configuration.\n\nWith both powertrains drawing from the same 82-kWh battery, the Single Motor EX40 is good for an EPA-rated 296 miles and 260 miles with the Dual Motor version. On a DC fast charger, both can replenish their batteries from 10% to 80% in as little as 28 minutes.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge Review: A Ravenous Rocket\nVolvo Streamlines EV Model Names for 2025\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge?\nResearch the 2025 Volvo EX40\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
