      "expert_review": "When it comes to trucks, size matters.\n\nI’m talking about not only the size of the truck, but the size of the price on the window sticker.\n\nBuyers don’t seem to mind dropping 30 large on a fully loaded Ford F-150 Lariat, Dodge Ram or Chevy Silverado.\n\nBut they balk when asked to pay a lot for a small truck. Nissan’s truck sales are down nearly 50 percent this model year.\n\nI can’t find fault with the new Nissan Frontier. The Japanese automaker has done a superb job updating its small truck, one of the longest-running series of vehicles on the market. (Until the current generation was named Frontier, Nissan’s truck didn’t have a name.)\n\nBut after comparing what you get on the Nissan Frontier XE King Cab with the base model Ford F-150 and Chevy C/K full-size trucks, it makes little sense to buy the Frontier. For barely $1,000 more, the full-size Ford and Chevy blow the doors off the Nissan in every category that matters — engine size, hauling capability, equipment and accessories.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nAll Frontiers come with a 2.4-liter, inline, four-cylinder engine that is rated at 143 horsepower. Later this year, Nissan plans to make a 3.3-liter V-6 optional. A four-speed automatic transmission adds $956 to the window sticker. Our test truck came with the standard five-speed manual gearbox.\n\nAt first the Frontier seems a bit sluggish, as if it is struggling to break free and get moving. But once you get under way and the engine builds a few revs, the Frontier starts to move with a little more verve.\n\nDuring the time I tested the Frontier, I noticed that the engine would strain badly if the transmission was not in the proper gear.\n\nSome engines have enough power to get a vehicle going even if the speed is too slow for the gear. But this is one engine that doesn’t generate much power when the RPMs are low.\n\nDespite frequent shifting in city traffic, I found the Frontier to be an easy truck to drive. The clutch pedal is smooth and easy, and the gear shifter clicks quickly and lightly into each slot.\n\nNissan engineers stiffened the Frontier’s frame by adding all sorts of panels and brackets and braces. The result is a more refined, better-riding truck than previous models.\n\nThe suspension system seems fairly soft when you roll over small bumps, but it firms up nicely when the going gets rough. The Frontier has a fairly rugged feel.\n\nHowever, the anti-lock brake system is one area where Nissan chintzed out. The system is operable only on the rear drum brakes; on many other trucks, the ABS system works on all four wheels.\n\nBut the Frontier’s brakes work well and stop the truck quickly in most instances. On slick roads, four-wheel ABS would likely shorten the stopping distance.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nNissan is perhaps second only to Toyota when it comes to building high-quality, durable vehicles. The new Frontier, which is made in America, likely will uphold Nissan’s quality tradition.\n\nDespite s ome hard driving, I didn’t hear any squeaks or rattles. The Frontier also is quiet at highway speeds. The doors seal against the body tightly, shutting out wind noise.\n\nFor its $16,000 price tag, our test truck seemed to be lacking accessories. It did not have power door locks, windows or mirrors.\n\nElectric windows would be nice because the cab is a bit too wide to lean over and crank open the passenger side window. It’s also a drag, initially at least, to manually adjust the passenger-side mirror.\n\nOur light green test truck came with a sliding rear window and small fold-away jump seat for one rear passenger. There’s plenty of room behind the rear seats for items you want to store inside the vehicle. I put several boxes back there and found it was no trouble putting them in and taking them out.\n\nI like the style, comfort and dimensions of the interior. The cloth seats are superb. The redesigned dash, along with a slighter wider body, enabled Nissan’s interior designers to open things up a bit.\n\nEven though the Frontier is classified as a compact, it doesn’t feel as small as a Ford Ranger or any other pickup in its class.\n\nThe controls for the air conditioner and radio are within easy reach and are a cinch to use.\n\nFrontier comes with a set of cleanly styled, easy-to-read analog gauges. The rest of the controls are on the steering column behind the wheel.\n\nThe 1998 model comes with an air bag cutoff switch that deactivates the passenger-side bag. This is an excellent feature in case infants or children need to ride up front.\n\nThe Frontier isn’t a bad truck. In fact the list of negatives is relatively minor.\n\nIts biggest problem is what it offers for the money. This time American manufacturers have Nissan whipped by a country mile.\n\nThe Frontier could be a big success for Nissan if it offered greater value.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $14,640. Safety Dual air bags, rear anti-lock braking system, front crumple zone and side-impact protection. Price as tested: $16,058. EPA rating: 22 mpg city/26 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The new Frontier King Cab has plenty of power and a good ride. It’s also comfortable and well-made. But it is a small truck with a big price tag.",

      "expert_review": "A Nissan Frontier pickup with four–count ’em–traditional swing-open doors for ease of rear-seat entry and exit without fooling with tiny swing back rear-access doors. The only traditional four-door compact pickup in the industry.\n\nOnly about 3,000 will be built at Nissan’s Smyrna, Tenn., plant, the same one that builds Frontier and the Xterra sport-utility off the same platform.\n\nOnly 3,000 because Nissan can’t make Xterras (Cartalk, May 2) fast enough. The original target of 50,000 Xterra sales annually is up to 70,000 and Nissan is talking with the folks at Smyrna about overtime to boost production some more.\n\nWhat impressed us most about the crew cab other than its peppy 3.3-liter, 170-h.p. V-6 and rear doors was the optional ($200) aftermarket “bed extender.”\n\nThe extender simply is a series of aluminum tubes tied together to form a huge letter “C” that resembles a bench laid on its side in the cargo bed.\n\nRest the “C” legs against the tailgate and it holds groceries or golf clubs so they don’t slip around. Lower the tailgate flat and flip the “C” over backwards and it’s a cargo bed extension that allows you to carry longer items such as lumber, without it slipping off the tailgate.\n\nOr, after hauling the lumber or after shooting a round of golf, slip the “C” out, place it on the ground and use it as a picnic bench.\n\nThe crew cab starts at $17,290 for a 4×2 with 5-speed manual to $20,940 for a 4×4 with automatic.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: While not an all-new pickup, significant changes to the 2022 Frontier go a long way toward making it more competitive with the segment leaders — for now.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s more comfortable, more powerful, more capable and a better value than a Toyota Tacoma or Chevrolet Colorado, but it falls short of the powertrain sophistication seen in the Ford Ranger and Jeep Gladiator.\n\nIf you’re under 30 years old, you’ve probably known only one Nissan Frontier the majority of your motoring life. That’s because Nissan hasn’t redesigned, or even significantly updated, its mid-size pickup since the 2005 model year. That’s right: It’s been 17 years since the Frontier got major attention. Yet it’s managed to soldier on as a popular value alternative to the more popular Toyota Tacoma, the more sophisticated Ford Ranger, the more rugged Jeep Gladiator, and the more American-flavored Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon. Well, Nissan seems to have decided that, now that its mid-size truck is practically old enough to vote and buy a pack of smokes, it’s time to get with the program and offer up a new Frontier. \n\nRelated: 2022 Nissan Frontier Gets Major Update, Keeps Its Tidy Dimensions\n\nThe new Frontier isn’t entirely new — and I’ll say right now, that’s just fine. Instead of opting to put the Frontier on its internationally available Navara platform, Nissan decided the most cost-effective way to cater to the American market was to simply give the current Frontier a very, very thorough makeover. \n\nHow similar is the new Frontier to the old one? Similar enough that it apparently wasn’t much of an issue for Nissan to pop the new-for-2022 3.8-liter V-6 powertrain into the 2020 model-year truck. The fact that Nissan did this had us worried it wouldn’t go far enough in its redo to make the new Frontier a viable, competitive alternative to newer trucks on the market. But after driving it for a day in the high canyons of Utah, I can say now I needn’t have worried. The 2022 Frontier may share some bones with the old one, but you’d never know it looking at or piloting it; this truck is far, far better than the outgoing model. \n\nOh Yeah, You Blend (No Really, You Do)\n\nIt starts with the styling: It’s bigger, chunkier and longer, yet the Frontier doesn’t have a bigger footprint than it did before. Nissan kept the old truck’s tidy overall dimensions, which was what buyers said they wanted: A truck good for work and play that fits in a garage and can be easily parked in congested urban areas. \n\nGiven just about every other pickup truck grows ever bigger with each redesign, it’s extraordinary that the ’22 Frontier is only 4 inches longer than the old one (and all of that is a hefty new schnoz) and keeps its compact wheelbase unchanged. It looks like a bigger truck, but it isn’t — inside or out. It’s just chunkier and bulkier, with a more mechanical look to its styling; there’s less of the old Frontier’s minimalist sleekness and more of the chiseled-block look the rest of Nissan’s lineup is going for. And that’s perhaps most important — the fact that it now looks like the rest of Nissan’s lineup. It fits in well with its full-size Titan big brother and even the new Pathfinder SUV. It’s attractive and well proportioned, and it looks more modern than just about any other mid-size pickup on the market (for now). \n\nA New Face and Some New Digs\n\nThe new Frontier’s face-lift doesn’t stop at styling. It has a (mostly) new interior that’s a vast improvement over the old one. Not that it was hard to make a better interior than the old Frontier’s; it wasn’t all that well received in 2005, so you can imagine what 17 years of general stagnation did for its competitiveness — especially against brilliant offerings like the 2020 Jeep Gladiator’s interior. \n\nWell, there’ll be no more poking fun at the old guy on the block: The Frontier’s new interior is modern, comfortable, exceptionally well-screwed-together (even on our preproduction prototype test vehicles), and it looks and feels fantastic. There are, however, a couple of places where the old Frontier pokes through the new facade. The steering wheel doesn’t telescope, it just tilts — mind-boggling for a 2022 model. The placement of some switches also remains questionable. Buttons that control things like hill descent control and the locking differential on the Pro-4X off-road model, and even safety items like traction control and Nissan Safety Shield 360, are still down by your left knee. That means Nissan didn’t want to spend the money to relocate them somewhere less impossible to use on the fly. On the plus side, the addition of the very comfortable (if oddly named) Zero Gravity front seats and a ton of new storage options make a cabin that’s fantastic for front occupants; the center console alone has a mammoth amount of space.\n\nBackseat passengers, however, will have the same issue they did in the old Frontier: It’s cramped back there. Nissan insists buyers are OK with it, that “make it bigger” was not a request for the backseat — and given how expensive a tear-up it would have been to change the wheelbase or get too crazy with the body reconfiguration, Nissan was surely happy to keep it as is. The rear doors are small, as well, so getting in and out requires a bit of a contortion act — just like in the old Frontier. That said, it’s honestly not all that different from the backseat in the Ford Ranger, which isn’t exactly capacious. If you’re looking for a big backseat in a mid-size pickup, only the Honda Ridgeline really delivers. \n\nLuxury-Car Quiet?\n\nSo here’s a surprise for you: The biggest takeaway I got from driving the new Frontier is that it’s an astonishingly quiet cruiser. I don’t just mean it’s been made a bit more refined, I mean it’s incredibly quiet in there. There’s almost no wind noise, almost no road noise — even in a Pro-4X with all-terrain tires. There’s just very little of the outside world making its way into the cabin. Combine that with a newly refined ride and solid, confident handling, and the new Frontier vaults to the front of the pack in terms of driving goodness. \n\nWe sampled the Frontier’s new powertrain when Nissan stuffed it into the last-generation 2020 Frontier. It’s a 3.8-liter V-6 (the four-cylinder is no more) making 310 horsepower and 281 pounds-feet of torque. That’s exceptional for a base engine; it outguns the Ranger when it comes to horsepower but falls a bit short of that truck’s turbo four-cylinder for torque. Nissan’s V-6 is mated to a new nine-speed automatic transmission sourced from the bigger Titan pickup, and it uses all nine of those gears frequently — meaning the transmission shifts a lot in normal operation. Of course, with nine gears to play with, why shouldn’t it shift a lot to get the truck to perform as requested? The transmission is smooth and inoffensive, and the Frontier’s overall powertrain improvements go a long way toward boosting its refinement. \n\nAgain, you’ll see a bit of the old Frontier peeking through in the mechanicals — particularly the steering. It’s extremely heavy, requiring considerably more effort than you might expect (much like its Titan big brother). That’s because it still uses a hydraulic power steering system with a belt-driven pump, not a more modern electric system like we’re seeing on other models. As such, you don’t get systems like lane centering or any semi-autonomous self-driving features. What you do get is a confident on-road sensation that doesn’t feel like you’re piloting a video game controller, as electric power steering does in many of today’s vehicles. The ratio has at least been quickened for 2022, so the Frontier doesn’t feel heavy or ponderous when changing lanes or negotiating twisty canyon roads, it just requires more effort. \n\nOne area that didn’t get any better was fuel economy. Nissan rates the new Frontier at 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. (EPA estimates aren’t yet available.) The Ranger is EPA-rated at 21/26/23 mpg (4×2) and 20/24/22 mpg (4×4). Even the Tacoma does better, at an EPA-estimated 19/24/21 mpg (V-6 4×2) and 18/22/20 mpg (V-6 4×4). Despite four more gears than the outgoing Frontier and three more than the Tacoma, it’s clear that boosting fuel economy was not a priority with the 2022 redesign. \n\nStill Does Trucky Things\n\nI drove two versions of the Frontier: a top-spec Pro-4X off-road trim and an on-road-oriented SV 4×4 trim. Both exhibited exceptional ride quality, vaultlike construction, amazingly silent operation and plenty of front-seat comfort.\n\nI took the Pro-4X on an extensive off-road hill climb that required use of its part-time four-wheel-drive system’s low-range feature, and Nissan’s desire to keep the Frontier simple on the technology front was apparent. There’s no fancy terrain select dial, no adjustable hill descent control, no all-wheel-drive option, no disconnecting sway bars. There’s just a dial to select 2WD, 4WD High or 4WD Low, plus one button to engage the electronic locking rear differential and another to engage hill descent control. It’s up to you to know when to use them and when not to, which is fine for owners used to such systems. \n\nThe Frontier clambered up steep and dusty rock faces for an hour with nary a complaint. Its low-range Off-Road Mode (which automatically activates when you shift into 4WD Low) kept engine torque up, the transmission primed, and the ensemble climbing and bumping over obstacles with relative ease. All Frontier 4x4s get three steel skid plates underneath, but the Pro-4X has an additional aluminum one that’s half-integrated into the front fascia — both for a bit of additional protection and for snazzy styling purposes. \n\nIf you’re interested in the looks of the Pro-4X but not its off-road ability, you can opt for the new Pro-X trim, which features all the styling of the Pro-4X and its Bilstein shock absorbers, but not the four-wheel-drive system or underbody skid plate protection. \n\nAfter dragging a 5,600-pound ski boat and trailer combo behind a Pro-4X, I can attest that the new Frontier tows quite well. It has a new dedicated Tow mode button that adjusts various settings to optimize the truck for such duty. The 2022 Frontier’s maximum tow rating is 6,720 pounds, but it can be achieved only in a 2WD S or SV trim, not a loaded Pro-4X. Still, the Pro-4X managed to tow quite well. \n\nThe V-6’s midrange torque comes in handy in around-town driving. Only from a standing start with the accelerator pushed to the floor did I really feel like it struggled to get up to speed — a good reminder that this is just a 3.8-liter engine, not a big V-8. The truck felt level, planted and stable, and the trailer didn’t push it around at all during normal driving. There’s no integrated trailer brake controller, but Nissan says a wireless accessory one will be available. For light-duty towing of things like watercraft or small lightweight campers, the Frontier would do nicely. \n\nThe truck’s maximum payload rating is 1,610 pounds, again in the 2WD SV trim. (Nissan has not yet provided towing or payload specs for other trim levels, of which there are four.) We didn’t do any hauling with the new Frontier, so how it behaves with a big load in the bed is yet to be determined. The bed itself is more voluminous than before, however, thanks to raised bed sides: They’re 1.4 inches taller than they used to be, boosting bed volume by 7%. The truck’s 5-foot bed capacity goes from 37.4 cubic feet to 40.1, while the 6-foot bed is up from 46.4 cubic feet to 49.6. \n\nTwo cab styles are available: the extended King Cab model gets the 6-foot bed, while crew-cab trucks get the 5-foot bed. The only exception is that Nissan will make a long-wheelbase crew-cab version with a 6-foot bed, but it will be available in only one spec: an SV trim aimed at buyers who use their trucks for both work and play — and who’ve been vocal about wanting this configuration. \n\nThe Value Push\n\nPricing for the Frontier certainly doesn’t look like it used to: The base price is now $29,015 (including destination fee) for a 2WD S King Cab. That’s nearly $9,000 more than the Frontier cost two model years ago when it was the value leader in this segment with a four-cylinder engine and manual transmission. A good deal of safety features, however, are now standard, including forward collision warning, trailer sway control, a driver awareness sensor, rear door alert and an easy-fill tire alert. Nissan Safety Shield 360 is available on every trim level, adding lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic rear emergency braking, blind spot warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and automatic high beams. Additional available features include traffic-sign recognition, intelligent cruise control and sonar rear parking sensors. A loaded Pro-4X like the one I tested stickers at just under $45,000, which matches up well against competing trucks with similar off-road equipment.\n\nIs It Enough?\n\nNissan didn’t go the clean-sheet-design route with the new Frontier. Instead, in response to a lot of customer demand (and likely on a limited budget), the automaker opted for significant upgrades, updates and refinements to the old one. Did Nissan go far enough in its makeover of this mid-sizer? I think it did — for now. \n\nThe changes result in a far more pleasant, refined, comfortable and capable truck than the old one. It still has a few foibles, but it’s easily competitive with the current crop of mid-size trucks — and better than many of them (I’m looking at you, Tacoma). \n\nThe key word, though, is current. With the next Ranger expected to be built off the Bronco platform and loaded with tech, plus a new Colorado, Canyon and Tacoma all expected soon, Nissan had better be hard at work getting the Frontier some more upgrades to keep it current with the next crop of trucks. Until then, it’s a fantastic update to the Frontier that should be able to draw some buyers back to the brand.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCheap and Cheerful No More: 2020 Nissan Frontier Priced From $27,885\nNissan Frontier: 5 Things That Need Fixin’\n2020 Nissan Frontier Gives Us a Taste of the Upcoming Redesign\nMore Nissan Frontier News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Verdict: Nissan put the heart of the all-new 2021 Frontier in the body of the 2020, creating a compelling mix of bulletproof-if-dated old-school Japanese pickup truck design with a fully modern powertrain.\n\nVersus the competition: The briefly available 2020 Frontier is still well behind more modern mid-size pickup trucks like the Ford Ranger, Chevrolet Colorado and Toyota Tacoma in terms of onboard technology, but it still gives them all a solid run for the money in terms of capability. If you care more about good value, compact dimensions and proven hardware than fancy new technology, the Frontier is still worth considering. \n\nFirst of all, don’t get too excited — this is not the all-new 2021 Nissan Frontier that we’ve been awaiting for years. At least, it’s not all of it. It is part of it, however, as Nissan decided to send the venerable old Frontier off with one last model year of celebration using the beating heart of the upcoming next-generation model. Yep, Nissan has plopped the engine and transmission of the ’21 model into the ’20, and is providing it standard in a trimmed-down lineup for however long the company decides to run the production lines this year before switching over to the ’21. This means that a powerful new 3.8-liter V-6 replaces the old 4.0-liter mill, and the transmission grows four more gears to a total of nine forward speeds. But can a heart transplant in an old body make much of a difference in the old workhorse? Turns out, it can.\n\nRelated: 12 Great Cars for Graduates and New Professionals\n\nThis Heart Beats Faster\n\nThe 2019 Frontier (and all prior ones since the truck’s last redesign for the 2005 model year) featured two engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and an optional 4.0-liter V-6. For 2020, both the four-cylinder and the five-speed manual transmission are no more, and the V-6 gets a major redo. It’s now a 3.8-liter V-6 engine, producing a hefty 310 horsepower and 281 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a 49-hp bump from the old 4.0-liter V-6, and it is accompanied by a new nine-speed transmission that’s lifted straight out of the new 2020 Nissan Titan full-size truck (albeit with different gearing and tuning).\n\nNissan says this is the new powertrain from the upcoming all-new, completely redesigned 2021 Frontier pickup that we should see sometime late in 2020, but the engine development outpaced the truck development, so Nissan decided to stuff it in the old-style truck for a year (although it’s being cagey on whether the 2021 model will also offer manual transmissions). It’s not an uncommon thing for Japanese automakers to do — Toyota and Mazda have done this before, putting the new powertrain in the old model for a year to give it something of a head start on real-world testing and reliability. \n\nThe Frontier’s new engine activates with a push-button start instead of a twisting key, unlike the old Frontier. It fires to life and then settles down into a smooth hum, quieter and more refined than the previous engine. Slip the plasticky shifter into drive, and off you go with significantly better acceleration and power. The new powertrain gives the Frontier some spunk, as the whole ensemble is lighter than the outgoing 4.0-liter and five-speed automatic. \n\nIn the Titan, when paired with that truck’s big 5.6-liter V-8, the transmission is flawless and beautifully matched. Here, however, all is not well — the transmission’s behavior in the lower gears is hunting and imperfect. Coasting down to a stop, it downshifts a bit too eagerly, putting you in a lower gear than might be necessary for smoothness. It allows for faster acceleration when you get on the power again, but it’s not a smooth transition, causing some head bobbing in the cabin. Starting from a stop also displays some rougher shifting as it quickly gets through the lower gears to the higher ones. \n\nNow, once it’s beyond 3rd gear, things smooth out considerably. It turns the Frontier into a highway champ, with the truck loping along at just under 2,000 rpm at 75 mph and doing so in a newfound silence that’s surprisingly serene. Downshifts are quick for passing, and power is plentiful; while the truck didn’t get a boost to its torque rating, it didn’t really need one. The powertrain in the prior truck was a high point despite its five-speed auto, and the new one retains it as a definite benefit. \n\nWhere’s the Fuel Economy Benefit?\n\nNissan says the fuel economy of the new powertrain in the current truck is significantly better, with the 3.8-liter V-6 outpacing even the old 2.5-liter four-cylinder for efficiency. (The EPA hasn’t published the 2020 Frontier’s mileage estimates as of publication.) Nissan expects the new powertrain combo to be rated at 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive and 17/23/19 mpg for 4×4 models. By comparison, the best you could do with the old four-cylinder was in rear-wheel drive with a manual transmission, netting you an official EPA rating of 19/23/21 mpg — but since the new truck isn’t offered with a manual, comparing it to the old four-cylinder automatic transmission model that got 17/22/19 mpg does indeed give the new V-6 an advantage. \n\nA more appropriate comparison is V-6 to V-6 — and the new one does outshine the old one, at least in terms of expected official ratings. The best the old V-6 could manage was in a rear-wheel-drive automatic-transmission model, where it was rated at 16/23/19 mpg, while the four-wheel-drive automatic came in at 15/21/17 mpg. The new V-6 is expected to best these numbers by about 2 mpg on average across the board — but our own testing didn’t show any improvement at all, and in fact came in worse than the V-6 4×4 Pro-4X model we tested in 2016.\n\nThat model got an observed 18.1 mpg on our 165-mile test loop as part of our PickupTrucks.com 2016 Midsize Pickup Challenge, but my repeat of that exact loop in the 2020 model returned an observed 17.5 mpg rating, below the expected rating and less than the previous truck was able to manage. In comparison, other mid-size trucks generally beat the Frontier — the 2020 Ford Ranger 4×4 coming in at 20/24/22 mpg with its turbocharged four-cylinder engine and 10-speed automatic transmission, the 2020 Chevy Colorado earning a 17/24/19 mpg rating with its 3.6-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic (with an optional turbo-diesel four-cylinder getting a whopping 19/28/22 mpg), and the 2020 Toyota Tacoma even beating it with an 18/22/20 mpg rating and its ancient 3.5-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic. To Nissan’s credit, it’s still dealing with an old design, and powertrain improvements can do only so much — the company’s engineers promise further fuel economy improvements with the 2021 model thanks to use of lightweight materials and better aerodynamics, so the final word on this has not yet been written.\n\nInside, Same as It Ever Was\n\nSo the driving experience is mostly improved, but the interior is still the same as it’s been for the past 15 years. The gauges are backlit orange on white and are hard to read in the daytime (and look for all the world like the gauges in the old 2003 Pathfinder I used to own). The interior is plain, plastic and simple — but honestly, it isn’t  much different than other mid-size trucks from Chevrolet or Ford in terms of overall materials quality. Only Jeep does a seriously high-quality interior in a mid-size truck with the Gladiator’s stylish Wrangler-based cabin, but you’re charged a fortune for it. \n\nLike before, the Frontier is offered in two sizes: extended King Cab and full four-door crew cab. But Nissan has streamlined the offerings a bit: The King Cab can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive in S and SV trims, both with long beds. The crew cab is offered in rear- or four-wheel drive in S, SV short wheelbase (standard bed), SV long wheelbase (long bed) and Pro-4X off-road trim (4×4 standard bed only). A leather-wrapped shift knob, tilt steering column (but not telescoping), and power windows and locks are newly standard across the board. \n\nThe interior is more comfortable than you might think, but it’s tight in back for legroom on the crew-cab Pro-4X I tested. The steering wheel is a chunky and simple affair, and all of the orange backlit interior lighting and orange LCD panels are truly a throwback to Nissans of yesterday, but there’s a decidedly old-school appeal about all of it. I think the Frontier has passed from the derogatory realm of “outdated” and now can be certifiably called “classic” in terms of its design, proof that if you just leave something alone long enough, it becomes desirable for its nostalgia factor. It certainly seems to be working — Nissan’s barely touched the truck in 15 years, and it still sells tens of thousands of units annually, largely based on its bulletproof reputation, proven components and value pricing.\n\nNew Tech? More Like No Tech\n\nOn one hand, there’s very little of the technology we expect in modern vehicles in the 2020 Frontier — the multimedia screen is tiny by today’s standards at just 5.8 inches, and while it features a navigation system, it does not have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto capability. There’s no automatic cruise control, no forward collision warning system, no lane keep assist or blind spot warning and so on. \n\nOn the other hand, there’s very little to distract you from the task of actually driving the truck. You’re not playing with apps, or fiddling with Waze, or finding a Spotify playlist or trying to figure out the distance keeping function on the automatic-following cruise control because none of that is here. For safety, you have airbags. For navigation, you have the native system. It’s refreshing — nothing is mysteriously dinging at you when you change lanes without signaling, nothing is flashing at you if you don’t brake aggressively enough for the truck’s taste when traffic has stopped in front of you. It’s just you, driving the truck. It’s lovely.\n\nStill a Good Value?\n\nFrankly, we don’t know, but we suspect the 2020 Frontier is a good value. Pricing for the 2020 model hasn’t been announced as of this writing, and in fact, the arrival in dealers is also in question as the factory where the Frontier is made is currently shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But as soon as it restarts, getting production moving on the 2020 Frontier will be Nissan’s priority, the company told us. Until then, we just have to assume that pricing isn’t going to vary terribly much from the V-6-equipped 2019 models. The starting price for a 2019 V-6 SV King Cab 4×2 is $27,015 including a $1,095 destination charge. But there will still be an S version available for 2020 with that standard V-6 engine (it’s available only with a four-cylinder for 2019), so the starting price for a 2020 model will almost certainly be less than this.\n\nThe new 2020 Frontier gives us a promising peek into what’s coming for 2021 but still presents a compelling reason to buy it instead of waiting for the all-new model. For fans of old-school Japanese trucks, it will be the last of its kind, older as it is than even the popular but dated Toyota Tacoma. To be able to get that old-school Japanese truck design with a fully updated powertrain and slightly better fuel economy presents a very intriguing package indeed.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThe 2021 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck that seats up to five people. It comes with a 310-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, and competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Ranger.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. A redesigned Frontier will arrive as a 2022 model. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Nissan Frontier Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity \nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nUnderbody skid plates\nPower moonroof\nSatellite radio\nShould I Buy the 2021 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThe Frontier offers good maneuverability and visibility, but its interior is basic, and the King Cab version isn’t all that roomy. The new-for-2020 drivetrain modernizes the truck, but the Frontier is due for a major redesign for the 2022 model year. Truck shoppers would be smart to wait for the new version, which is slated to arrive in summer 2021.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X is a tough little truck that excels at a little bit of everything — and it’s an exceptional value for an off-road pickup. Its mid-size dimensions make it easy to live with in city traffic, and it has just what you need to have fun on the trails.\n\nVersus the competition: Other mid-size trucks may have flashier infotainment systems and higher-tech off-road modes, but they often cost significantly more. The Frontier Pro-4X hits a sweet spot among off-road pickups, with more standard creature comforts than the work-truck-based Chevrolet Colorado Trail Boss and a lower starting price than the Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road.\n\nIn the year of our giant touchscreen 2024, the Nissan Frontier Pro-4X is downright refreshing. The Pro-4X is an off-road trim of the rugged, versatile Frontier pickup that competes against the Chevrolet Colorado Trail Boss and Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road, and it’s fun both on the pavement and off — with none of its controls getting in the way of a good time. The Frontier’s dashboard is dominated by physical knobs and buttons, its wheelbase is relatively short, and most of the Pro-4X trim’s off-road upgrades are relatively low-tech: thick steel skid plates, upgraded shocks and all-terrain tires.\n\nRelated: Throwback: 2024 Nissan Frontier Gets ’80s-Inspired Hardbody Edition, Starts at $31,105\n\nThis is all by design, of course. The current-generation Frontier is heavily based on the outgoing truck, which debuted for the 2005 model year. Its short wheelbase was mercifully kept the same, but the Frontier’s styling was dragged out of the Great Recession and into the present day. It did grow about 5 inches in length when the current gen was released for 2022, but it remains one of the smallest mid-size trucks on sale today.\n\nThis Frontier is an evolution, not a revolution, and after a week spent on curvy Texas Hill Country roads and a day at an off-road park, I found it to be an incredibly well-rounded truck that’s genuinely easy to live with.\n\nLet’s Get Dirty\n\nThis is why you’re looking at the Pro-4X, isn’t it? All 2024 Frontiers share the same 3.8-liter V-6 engine, which is good for 310 horsepower and 281 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission, but it’s the Pro-4X’s list of extras that makes it special; it’s worth springing for if you enjoy going off the pavement.\n\nThe Frontier Pro-4X has a double-wishbone independent suspension up front with a Dana solid rear axle in back, plus Bilstein off-road shocks at all four corners. It also has an electronically locking rear differential and, of course, four-wheel drive. Three steel underbody skid plates protect the oil pan, transfer case and fuel tank, and all of this rides on 17-inch alloy wheels with P265/70R17 Hankook Dynapro AT2 all-terrain tires. There are stock recovery hooks if you get really stuck painted in the same Lava Red accent color that the Pro-4X uses inside and out. Hill start assist and hill descent control are included for help on tricky grades, and the Pro-4X has LED headlights and foglights.\n\nA lengthy spec sheet means nothing if the truck doesn’t work, though, and I was able to escape the city for the trails at Hidden Falls Adventure Park to put the Pro-4X to the test. It scrambled up and down trails alongside more built rigs with relative ease; the stock all-terrain tires have ample grip when aired down for trail use, and being able to engage the truck’s off-road features via physical knobs and buttons meant I didn’t even have to take my gloves off on a windy winter day.\n\nThe 4-high and 4-low settings are also controlled by a simple knob, and they engaged quickly when I came to a stop. That alone made it feel like luxury wheeling compared with the pull-stiff-knob-and-crawl-forward dance I’ve been used to on most of the Jeeps I’ve taken out. The system even tells you on the instrument panel what to do if you forget to put it into Neutral.\n\nBeing one of the smaller pickups in its class — as well as the narrowest — has advantages when picking a line or avoiding trail pinstripes down the side of the truck when you get closer to the shrubs than you expect. The Frontier’s steering is slow enough that it’s easy to place your wheels exactly where you want them, too. The one thing that was a tad too large for me, a 5-foot-4 driver, was the hood, which bulged right into my line of vision on steeper inclines.\n\n2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X forward-facing camera | Cars.com photo by Stef Schrader\n\nThere is, however, a great built-in workaround for this: Nissan put the camera button smack-dab in the middle of the dashboard, right underneath the touchscreen, giving drivers an easy way to see “through” the hood in trucks equipped with the optional Intelligent Around View Monitor, which has a forward-facing view. The camera’s onscreen guidelines curve as you turn the steering wheel, giving you a good idea of where your wheels will go when navigating obstacles. The camera visually flattens things a bit, and the image that’s displayed isn’t exactly a high-res affair, so you’ll still want to hop out to judge the height and depth of trickier obstacles. That said, the camera view is a great gut check for what’s up ahead.\n\nThe Frontier Pro-4X’s biggest weakness is its breakover angle, which determines how sharp a crest a truck can traverse without getting beached: At 19.6 degrees, it isn’t particularly competitive among its off-road-trim peers. The Frontier’s ground clearance is decent at 9.8 inches from the rear diff to the ground, but the number of purely mechanical components underneath suggests this wouldn’t be too hard to modify; the sway bars don’t automatically disconnect with the press of a button, and there are no electronically selectable terrain modes for the suspension.\n\nWhile the Frontier’s thick front and rear sway bars limit articulation a bit, popping a wheel in the air isn’t too big of an issue thanks to the electronic locking differential. Give it a second and it hooks up, evenly splitting torque across an axle so that whichever wheel has good traction on the ground can move you forward.\n\n2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X popping a wheel in the air | Cars.com photo by Stef Schrader\nComfortable and Confident On-Road, Too\n\nThose thick sway bars do seem to help in one place: on the road. The Frontier Pro-4X handles well on pavement, making twisty roads surprisingly fun. It changes direction more like a big car than the body-on-frame truck it is. It isn’t jarring over bumps, nor is it so softly sprung that it feels floppy. The truck’s hydraulic power steering is heavier than many of its modern peers, but I liked the amount of feedback it gave.\n\nOur test vehicle was optionally equipped with a sturdy spray-in bedliner, as well as Nissan’s “Utili-Track” cargo system. I needed to pick up a couple of new cacti to replace my dearly departed prickly pear, and I was able to keep them in place using a ratchet strap looped through this track-based cargo system. The tie-down system’s cleats were easy to move along the tracks mounted near the top of the bed, and they’re easy to secure in place with a simple screw-down knob. My only complaint is that there’s only a few fixed tie-down loops at the bottom of the bed, so I had to get a little creative to secure plant pots that were shorter than the track and taller than the fixed tie-downs. Either way, my new prickly pears survived a trip across town without breaking off any pieces in spite of Austin’s lumpy roads’ attempts to upset the truck.\n\nMy other grievances are mostly minor. The Frontier’s headlights are so bright and focused that they do a poor job illuminating above the main beam. I found this particularly frustrating on undulating roads where I frequently see deer; in the Frontier, I couldn’t see up the next hill all that well. The truck’s turning radius wasn’t particularly stellar, either, making backing out of my carport a two-point turn. That said, the Frontier’s smaller size certainly made it easier to navigate city traffic.\n\nThe Frontier’s engine stop-start system was also particularly rough every time the engine kicked back on; you’ll have to hit a button every time you start the truck if you want it disabled. Disabling it, however, does exacerbate the biggest practical downside of the Frontier: fuel economy. It’s a great value pricewise, but its fuel economy lags behind most of its mid-size pickup peers. Rear-wheel-drive versions earn an EPA-estimated 18/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, 4WD versions do slightly worse, and the Pro-4X brings up the rear with an estimated 18/22/19 mpg. I consistently got even less than that — as low as 17 mpg — mostly driving without stop-start enabled.\n\nThe 2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4x is shorter than the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile, thank goodness. | Cars.com photo by Stef Schrader\nOld-School Interior in Mostly Good Ways\n\nThe Frontier’s interior isn’t flashy, but it seems well suited for off-roading. Should you get the inside of the truck dusty, the sturdy plastics, rubber and other smooth materials inside are easy to clean. There’s only a little bit of dust-magnifying, fingerprint-displaying shiny black plastic, and it’s placed around the touchscreen, gear selector and steering-wheel controls — all places you’re less likely to scratch. The interior is simple but well assembled, and plenty of available leather and soft-touch materials make it feel comfortable.\n\nStorage bins under the rear seats, as well as a 9-inch-deep center console bin large enough to fit my small purse, made it easy to stash stuff when I was running errands and didn’t want to leave anything out in the open. You may want to invest in a locking bed cover if you haul around anything larger.\n\n2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X | Cars.com photo by Stef Schrader\n\nThe main front cupholders were grippy enough to withstand rocky trail climbing, but I was left wanting something to hold my phone in place. The optional wireless charging pad is just that — a rubber-coated pad — and it’s not grippy enough to keep a phone from moving out of place on trails. I quickly tired of my phone dinging from losing connection with the pad and moved it to another bin. It also tended to overheat on longer drives, but that’s a frustratingly common complaint about wireless charging pads in vehicles.\n\nOur test truck came equipped with heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, both of which are optional. They warmed up quickly and made a cold day on the trails easy to bear. The Frontier’s main heating system is also very potent. The Pro-4X comes only as a four-door crew cab, which has a roomier backseat than you might expect considering the truck’s smaller size. Taller passengers may struggle to get comfortable in the back if someone tall is also sitting in front of them, but it could work as a family truck.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable thing when you hop into the Frontier Pro-4X is its vast array of physical controls. Its dashboard touchscreen is only 9 inches, which is modest compared with the huge tablet-style touchscreens in many other trucks. More granular settings for the truck are found onscreen, as are the navigation and stereo controls. The driver can also control basic stereo functions using buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nDuring my test drive, the Frontier’s screen would sometimes lag for just a second, and the navigation glitched out when it couldn’t connect in a more rural town, but for the most part, the system worked well enough. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and wireless Apple CarPlay is available. Our test truck also had satellite radio and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nFor the most part, the Frontier’s controls are easy to use without taking your eyes off the road for too long. There’s a voice assistant for when you don’t want to search for a navigation or audio control, but it had a hard time understanding my voice and that I was trying to navigate to a point of interest instead of an address.\n\n2024 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X | Cars.com photo by Stef Schrader\n\nSome aspects of the Frontier’s interior may be a bit too much of a throwback, though. The steering wheel tilts but doesn’t telescope, which makes it harder for both taller and shorter drivers to find a comfortable driving position. The adjustable lumbar support is controlled with a fiddly lever on the inner side of the seat, which would be easy to accidentally hit when reaching between the seats.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nTowing With the 2023 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X: How Good Is It?\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nMid-Size Pickups Are Acceptable at Best in New IIHS Crash Test\nWhat Are the Best MPG Pickup Trucks?\nShop for a 2024 Nissan Frontier\nDoing a Bit of Everything Well\n\nThe Frontier Pro-4X’s upgrades may be sharply focused on unpaved shenanigans, but I found it to be an exceptionally well-rounded pickup. It performs even the most basic duties with ease, from hauling dirty, prickly things in its bed and going on boring errands to bashing down dirt roads. Its size made it easy to park and easy to live with even in a crowded city. Its interior isn’t the flashiest, and the infotainment system is clearly behind its peers, but with at least one safety organization planning to deduct points in vehicles lacking certain physical controls, maybe button-heavy interiors like the Frontier’s are the future after all. (I certainly hope so.) The Frontier Pro-4X is definitely worth a look if you want to head off-road but don’t want to sacrifice on-road driving manners to do so.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The King Cab has smaller rear-hinged doors for backseat access, while the crew cab has four full-size doors. Buyers can also choose a 5- or 6-foot bed and rear- or four-wheel drive. All are powered by a 3.8-liter naturally aspirated V-6 engine that makes 310 horsepower and 281 pounds-feet of torque, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Of note is the Pro-4X off-road variant, which features increased ground clearance, Bilstein dampers, underbody skid plates and all-terrain tires. The Frontier’s competitors include the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford Ranger, GMC Canyon and Toyota Tacoma. If you’re interested in pickup utility without the comfort compromises, be sure to check out the Honda Ridgeline, while buyers who want more customization options should look at the Jeep Gladiator.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Nissan Frontier?\n\nNissan updated the Frontier for 2025 with a restyled front end that gives it a more modern look. It also added a redesigned dashboard with a standard tilt-and-telescoping steering column and an available 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Towing capacity has increased across the board, up to a maximum of 7,150 pounds, and the crew-cab body style with the 6-foot box is now available in the SL and Pro-4X trim levels in addition to the SV. A slew of additional safety tech is now standard, including lane departure warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and rear parking sensors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Nissan Frontier Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto (wired)\nWi-Fi\nKeyless entry and start\nFour speakers\nDampened assist tailgate to prevent slamming open\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n120-volt household power outlets in cab and bed\nLED head- and taillights\nMoonroof\nSpray-in bedliner\nPower-adjustable front seats\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10-speaker Fender sound system\nSurround-view parking camera\nShould I Buy the 2025 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThe Frontier rides comfortably and handles well, but it doesn’t stand out in any particular area. Its towing and payload capacities are competitive, but rivals have more technologically advanced powertrains that are both more powerful and boast better fuel economy. Some interior bits and pieces still feel a little cheap after the update for 2025, and neither the front nor the rear seats are terribly comfortable.",

      "expert_review": "With the new 2005 Frontier, Nissan adapted the Nismo badge to its off-road packages for both 4×4 and 4×2 models. This follows similar moves by other manufacturers who have been successful in creating brand awareness for rugged off-road equipment. The trend is so profitable that off-road packages are no longer options; they’re now distinct models or trim levels. In recent years, the Nismo team earned solid credentials in strengthening the performance attributes of Nissan’s sporty cars. But increasing grip on the skid pad requires far different engineering than maintaining control over desert whoop-de-doos.\n\nAfter a torrential Texas thunderstorm cancelled any off-road excursions during my first ride in the new Frontier, I was eager to get a properly equipped Nismo model for a week-long test that would include a day in the dirt. My test model was a King Cab 4×4 Nismo equipped with an automatic transmission. I would have preferred a 6-speed manual to better compare the Nissan to the Toyota Tacoma Access Cab 4×4 with the TRD Off-Road package that I recently tested in the desert.\n\nBriefly, the new Frontier is clean-sheet design based on the Titan’s F-Alpha platform with no major parts carried over from the previous generation. It comes only in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations, both nestled on a 126-inch wheelbase. That’s about 10 inches longer than the old model, and the truck also widened to nearly 73 inches. The King Cab gets a 73.3-inch bed while the Crew Cab shortens up to 59.5 inches. Overall, the Frontier is roomier and certainly more powerful with a 265-horsepower 4.0-liter V6 engine.\n\nMost off-road packages are a blend of increased durability products, protection equipment and cosmetic upgrades. The Nismo package follows that strategy and also includes a host of available technological innovations. These additional features can improve safety but also make off-roading more manageable to mainstream driving abilities. Here’s what the Nismo package includes:\n\n* Off-road tuned Bilstein shock absorbers\n\n* Skid plates for oil pan, fuel tank and transfer case\n\n* Electronic locking rear differential\n\n* 16-inch alloy wheels\n\n* P265/75R16 BFGoodrich Rugged Trail tires\n\n* 4-wheel active brake limited-slip traction control\n\n* Nismo exterior badges and interior floor mats\n\nMy test vehicle came equipped with Hill Start Control (HSC), Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC), which is an electronic stability control system. All are available only with the 5-speed automatic transmission and all work as intended, but that doesn’t mean you want them engaged all the time. My first move as soon as I left the pavement was to switch off the VDC. There’s no doubt that this feature would be a blessing in the snow or on icy roads, but when you want to have fun in the dirt it’s an annoyance. It was hitting the brakes and cutting back on the throttle at the least little wheelspin and slowing down any progress through loose conditions. With the VDC off I could use the throttle to control the skids and maintain momentum when desired. Again, this would not be a concern if I had the 6-speed as these controls are not offered with the manual.\n\nThe HSC seems redundant with an automatic transmission. It works the brakes for up to two seconds after lifting your foot off the brake pedal while on an uphill slope and keeps the vehicle from rolling backward. This would seem to be a perfect tool for clutch-equipped vehicles and drivers who can’t work the handbrake at the same time, but it’s available only with the automatic. The HDC works perfectly whether in 4HI or 4LO and deserves any reluctant off-roader’s confidence. Just flick the switch on the dash and point the truck down the hill. HDC works the front and rear brakes as needed to maintain a steady and controllable speed downhill. I tried HDC twice and then simply used 4LO and First gear with no throttle or brake. The latter method was slower but smoother. Experienced off-roaders will still prefer to have total control of the brakes and throttle in these situations, but it’s nice to know that HDC will help a novice stay out of trouble. One very positive feature of the new Frontier is the lever-operated handbrake right next to the driver’s hip. This design is much easier to use than the Tacoma’s pull-handle setup.\n\nGetting back to LO range, the crawl ratio in First gear with the automatic is 31.248:1 while crawling with the 6-speed will give you a more desirable 40.119:1. The extra low gearing comes in a difference of axle ratio (3.35:1 auto, 3.69:1 manual) and First gear ratio (3.84:1 auto, 4.37:1 manual). The transfer case ratio is 2.625:1.\n\nThe Frontier moved well over very rough terrain but the extra wheelbase really doesn’t help in tight situations. Ground clearance is a healthy 10.1 inches (compared to the Tacoma’s 9.4 inches), and the frame rails are neatly tucked up under the body for a very clean appearance. Approach angle is 32.6 degrees and departure is 23.3 degrees. The ramp breakover angle is 20.5 degrees. My biggest problem with driving hard over aggressive terrain was hitting the bump stops. The Frontier bottomed-out too often for my style over the whoops. The softer suspension did articulate well through frame twisting exercises and it maintained good contact with the ground through most of the run. But I found myself tapping the brakes more than expected in the high-speed areas to avoid the hard jolts. The throttle-by-wire seemed less fussy and more reflective of my intent in 4LO than 4HI. I’m sure the calibration is set on the safe side for higher speeds and it really never interfered with any off-road assignments. But it does take some seat time to become fully acclimated to the throttle feel. Steering was a bit slow on the fast runs with an overall ratio of 20.4:1 but certainly more precise over delicate obstacles in low gear.\n\nOn road, the Frontier is a bit more comfortable than the Tacoma. It feels stable, even with the high stance. The steering is suited more to the asphalt than in the dirt with excellent communication to the road. Much of the comfort factor is traced to large, well-supportive seats, a friendly dash layout and a perception of more room than the Tacoma. Driving position is relaxed with excellent visibility. The standard CD sound system is acceptable but I know that the Crew Cabs have the Rockford Fosgate audio with eight speakers and two subwoofers as an option. The engine is very smooth in mid-range with plenty of pulling power. I also noticed less wind noise than usual.\n\nOther amenities, either standard or optional, on the new Frontier Nismo include a factory spray-in bedliner, Utili-trak cargo tie-down system, power windows/door locks, dual glovebox, three 12V power points, satellite radio, rear sliding window, fullsize spare, front tow hook and rear floor storage. Our test model had a GVWR of 5600 pounds, a GCWR of 11,133, max payload of 1261 pounds and max towing of 6300 pounds. Curb weight was 4339 pounds. Optional safety equipment include side airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nNissan directed considerable resources to the fullsize Titan, and the Frontier is now benefiting from that effort. It has a strong chassis, solid looks and plenty of innovation. Off road it works very well with the exception of high-speed runs over rough terrain. But the well-designed electronic controls on the automatic open up trails for less experienced drivers. The Frontier is a dramatic improvement over the previous generation and the overall package is certainly among the best of any midsize truck.",

We didn’t care that the Nismo, the top truck in Nissan’s midsize Frontier line, got 15 miles per gallon in the city and 20 miles per gallon on the highway. We dismissed its ride, which was somewhere north of brutal, especially on broken city streets. We simply wanted to use and abuse it, to exploit its hauling and towing power.\n\nBut we did absolutely nothing.\n\nWe didn’t remove one box, one bag of seldom-used clothing, one ancient computer from the basement’s clutter.\n\nThe Frontier Nismo — shorthand for Nissan Motorsports — is designed for hard work and extreme play. Its fully boxed steel frame makes it the perfect truck for off-road use. But we didn’t do that, either.\n\nInstead, we used all of the Frontier Nismo’s toughness to do what we easily could have done in a fuel-efficient, subcompact sedan.\n\nWe visited shopping centers, went to restaurants, visited relatives and went to church. And in the end, we tallied the cost of our week-long profligacy — $63.30 to fill the Frontier Nismo’s 21.1 gallon tank with regular unleaded gasoline at a cost of $3 per gallon.\n\nI wondered:\n\nHow many people buy trucks like the Frontier Nismo with noble intentions that have as much chance of fulfillment as the average political promise? How many salivate over horsepower and torque, the latter being the real measure of a vehicle’s ability to haul and tow, only to be weighted down by beer, pretzels and burgers and a media-room sofa that has the gravitational pull of a black hole? How many actually go off-road, putting the Frontier Nismo’s considerable prowess to the test? And if they dare leave paved highways, how often do they make such trips?\n\nNissan’s publicists swear that Frontier Nismo owners are atypical, meaning that they are not like the pickup truck poseurs who abandoned their rugged four-wheel-drive steeds when regular gasoline prices topped $2.50 a gallon. Frontier Nismo owners, like their Hummer H3 counterparts in the General Motors Corp. camp and FJ Cruiser devotees in the greener-than-thou Church of Toyota Motor Corp., actually go off-road to snowboard, mountain climb and windsurf, Nissan’s publicists say.\n\nMaybe they are right. But it’s a hard claim to prove by empirical observation.\n\nI have come across a few Frontier Nismo owners in wild places — mostly outside of bars and at tailgate parties in Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and that part of Virginia, from Richmond on down, that believes the South won the Civil War.\n\nOn vacation last month, I met a Frontier Nismo owner at the Walden Pond State Reservation near Concord, Mass. He was a naturalist and a swimmer. I wonder what Henry David Thoreau would have thought about his truck, parked on a lot across from a park latrine proudly labeled with notices that it used no water in its disposal of human waste.\n\nBut I’m being cheeky.\n\nThe Frontier Nismo is one of the best-built, best-priced, midsize four-wheel-drive pickup trucks available. It can carry a payload, the weight of cargo onboard, of 1,381 pounds. It can tow a trailer weighing 6,500 pounds. It can — and I know this, because I’ve done it with earlier Frontier Nismo models — crawl over rocks; move through mud, snow and dust; and climb steep mountain trails.\n\nBut I, like most people, including many Frontier Nismo owners, am not inclined to do any of those things on a regular basis.\n\nClaims to the contrary make good advertising copy. But after schlepping around Northern Virginia and environs in a pickup truck that weighs 4,455 pounds and barely gets 20 miles per gallon on a lightly loaded highway run, I’m left wondering if the Frontier Nismo and all of the extreme-sports, extreme-ride hype attached to it make any sense, let alone a sensible contribution to a sound national energy policy.\n\nNuts & Bolts 2006 Nissan Frontier Nismo\n\nComplaints: The Frontier Nismo rides like a rugged truck, especially on ruined city streets. Also, test-drive assistant Ria Manglapus didn’t like the weight of its optional sliding bed extender, which can be used to handle larger loads.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: It has no pretensions of sedan-like comfort. Acceleration is excellent. But all of that torque can spin the heck out of the truck’s rear wheels on wet roads when it is in two-wheel-drive. It handles ponderously — like a truck.\n\nHead-turning quotient: It has the demeanor of a physically fit young man who has enough money, time and sense of adventure to do and go where he wants when he wants. That’s its ultimate appeal.\n\nBody style/layout: It is a compact front-engine, midsize, short-bed pickup available with rear-wheel drive or on-demand four-wheel drive. It can be bought as a King Cab with narrow rear-access doors, or as the tested Crew Cab, with larger, more traditional, forward-hinged rear doors (and more interior space). The Nismo is the top of the Frontier line, which includes the Frontier XE (base), SE (popularly equipped) and LE (luxury edition).\n\nEngine/transmission: The Frontier Nismo comes with a 4-liter V-6 engine that develops 265 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 284 foot-pounds (pound-feet to you purists) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine can be mated to a five-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five. Maximum payload is 1,381 pounds. Maximum towing capacity is 6,500 pounds. The fuel tank holds 21.1 gallons of unleaded gasoline.\n\nReal-world mileage: We averaged 16 miles per gallon in city/highway travel.\n\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated disc brakes front and rear, antilock braking system and traction control.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2006 Frontier Nismo Crew Cab with automatic transmission is $27,200. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $25,155. Price as tested is $30,765, including $2,960 in options (including Rockford Fosgate sound system, side air bags, stability control, Sirius satellite radio, sliding bed extender) and a $605 destination charge. Dealer’s invoice price as tested is $28,257.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a high-quality off-road toy, essentially a sport-utility vehicle with a short cargo bed. Compare with top-line models of the Chevrolet Colorado, Dodge Dakota, Ford Ranger and Toyota Tacoma Pickups. For that matter, also compare with the Hummer H3 and Toyota FJ Cruiser SUVs.",

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Nissan Frontier is on sale now and carries over a host of upgrades from its 2022 makeover. The mid-size rig got a modernized interior, a more refined ride and many new standard safety features. After the extensive updates last year, the Frontier returns for 2023 with just a few key changes, including a pair of new appearance and convenience packages and connectivity upgrades on select trims. Shoppers can also expect to see prices increase between $500 and $1,430, depending on the variant.\n\nRelated: 2022 Nissan Frontier Gets Major Update, Keeps Its Tidy Dimensions\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Nissan Frontier | Manufacturer image\n\nFor 2023, the Frontier’s SV crew-cab trim adds a newly available Midnight Edition Package with black 17-inch alloy wheels, side mirrors, lower bumper and grille.

The Frontier can tow up to 6,720 pounds and has a maximum payload of 1,610 pounds.\n\nTech and Safety\n\nAn 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard for the 2023 Frontier; a 9-inch screen is available. Wireless charging is an option on the Pro variants. As far as safety features, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, trailer sway control, a driver awareness sensor and a rear door alert are standard. Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 is available on all models and adds more advanced tech like lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic rear emergency braking and a blind spot warning system.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2023 Nissan Frontier | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Frontier is on sale now and sees a $500 increase across most trims compared to the 2022 model; the crew-cab long-bed SV with the new convenience package increases by $1,430, while Pro models climb by $600. 4WD adds $3,200 to the starting price of the King Cab models and $3,000 for all crew cabs except the Pro-4X, which comes with standard 4WD.

      "expert_review": "For the 1999 model year, Nissan, not a company that had taken many chances with its pickup trucks, took a big one: Though light-duty, four-door pickup trucks had long been popular in plenty of other places, such as Central America, Nissan was the first to figure out that Americans who did not necessarily need to transport a six-person landscaping crew to the job site might like a four-door truck, too. Immediately, every other manufacturer followed suit, and now the top-selling segment of the truck market is one that essentially did not exist 10 years ago. So when we see a Nissan Frontier Crew Cab, we’re seeing the truck that started the four-door trend.\n\nAnd since 1999? Well, the current Frontier, which was redesigned for the 2005 model year, is an exceptionally nice compact truck, but the last frontier it conquered was in ’99. Which is fine, because no other manufacturer, with the exception of the Honda Ridgeline, has really advanced the cause of the smaller-than-full-sized pickup, either. For the most part, compact-truck sales are flat or declining, largely because the full-sized-truck market is so competitive, you often can buy one of those for the same price as a smaller truck.\n\nThat said, this is a very substantial pickup. The gutsy 4.0-liter V-6 — a 2.5-liter four-cylinder is standard, but you want the V-6 — ought to be enough for anyone. With 261 horsepower — 30 more than the 4.6-liter V-8 in the full-sized Ford F-150 pickup — a Frontier with the V-6 will tow a healthy 6,300 pounds, which is plenty for a truck this size. If you need more, then there’s the full-sized Nissan Titan, which comes with only the 5.6-liter V-8.\n\nThe Frontier is, in fact, built on the same chassis as the big Titan, just trimmed down a bit. Overall length of the Frontier Crew Cab I tested was 205.5 inches, and that’s with the standard bed. For 2007, you also can get a long-bed version of the Frontier Crew Cab, which totals 219.4 inches in length, about 6 inches shorter than the Titan. If it sounds as if the Frontier is pretty big for a compact pickup, it is, and that certainly has been the trend. The longest Frontier you could get in 1999 was 196.1 inches long, and the most powerful engine was a 170-horsepower V-6.\n\nThe test Frontier, a well-equipped SE model, is more comfy than you’d think on the highway, and not at all unpleasant to drive on a twisty road. Front seats are excellent, and rear seats are acceptable even for adults, though getting in and out takes a little twisting and turning. It’s an easy truck to get comfortable in, and it’s certainly muscular enough to get some work done.\n\nBut the price: At $25,960, it’s on par with comparable trucks, but it also isn’t far removed from a comparable Titan.\n\nHmm. Your money, your call.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThe 2019 Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck that seats up to five people. It comes standard with a 152-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine; a 261-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 is available. Both engines can work with a manual or automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado and Honda Ridgeline. \n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Nissan Frontier?\n\nA 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system is now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Nissan Frontier Are Most Important?\n\nThe King Cab (extended cab) truck has room for four, but the crew cab can hold up to five people. The King Cab has a 6-foot cargo bed, while the crew cab can have either a 5- or 6-foot bed. Cargo bed options include a spray-on bedliner and a rail system with movable tie-down cleats. Leather-trimmed seats, a power-adjustable driver's seat, heated side mirrors and a moonroof are also optional.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Nissan Frontier?\n\nThe Frontier proves affordable trucks still exist, but the base version doesn't come with many convenience features: it has manual side mirrors, manual windows and manual locks. While it offers good maneuverability and towing capability with the V-6 engine, the brake pedal feels mushy, and we noticed wind noise at highway speeds.",

      "expert_review": "Given the way I fell in love with the Ford F-150 I tested last year, I might be mistaken for some yee-haw-shouting, horse-trailer-pulling ranch hand. But I’m not. I’m a simple girl who lives in the suburbs with three children and a husband. I haul more groceries than horse trailers. Nevertheless, I do have an unlikely affinity for fun, practical and powerful trucks.\n\nThe 2012 Nissan Frontier PRO-4X doesn’t hit the mark perfectly in any of these categories, but for a smaller truck that’s decently priced, it does a good job of trying to keep up with the big guys.\n\nThe Frontier has a surprisingly spacious crew cab that fits five comfortably, plenty of storage options and a base model with an extended cab that starts below $20,000.\n\nOf course, if you want a bigger engine, a crew cab and four-wheel-drive, the starting price goes up a bit. The off-road-ready Frontier PRO-4X with a crew cab that I tested has a starting price of $30,495, including an $825 destination charge. With the addition of an USB input and floor mats, the grand total on my test car was $31,275. The PRO-4X also comes as a King Cab.\n\nWhereas the base model has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, the PRO-4X comes with a 4.0-liter V-6 engine. On paper that sounds great, but in reality, it was a bit disappointing. This is plenty of power for a truck this size, but the PRO-4X is configured for off-roading, making the drive around town feel downright awkward. I drove the Frontier up and down mountain highways, and though acceleration was fine, handling felt clumsy and rough on the smooth pavement. Word on the street is that the other Frontier models offer a better driving experience and if that’s the case, how can you fault the PRO-4X for doing what it’s made to do?\n\nEXTERIOR\nBecause it’s a smaller truck and has fender flares over the tires that look like bulbous muscles, the Frontier reminds me of a stout bodybuilder. In other words, it’s got some appeal and is definitely athletic-looking, but it’s not a look that is universally admired. Sixteen-inch off-road alloy wheels, tinted rear privacy glass, power side mirrors, and front and rear splash guards complete the Frontier’s rough-rider look.\n\nOne of the best things about a truck for a family is the freedom you have to load up the cargo bed without giving too much thought to the whole process. In an SUV or minivan, I often have a whole series of calculations required to ensure that everything my family needs for a trip will actually fit. There’s none of that with a truck since the bed is so spacious. The sky is literally the limit! I heaved bikes, strollers and luggage in the Frontier’s 4.5-foot bed and had room for plenty more.\n\nThe Frontier PRO-4X also comes with the Utili-Track channel system that makes securing cargo easy via sliding hooks. A standard cab-mounted cargo bed lamp is also great when you’re forced to load or unload in the dark. The Frontier can tow up to 6,500 pounds, which means that this is one small but mighty truck.\n\nBecause it’s a smaller truck, the Frontier’s step-in height is quite manageable, even for small children. Though my daughter is feisty and strong-willed, it’s notable that my tiny 2-year old was able to hoist herself into the truck without adult help. In other words, if she can do it, almost anyone can!\n\nThe base engine is a 2.5-liter dual-overhead-camshaft inline-four-cylinder engine that makes 152 horsepower and 171 pounds-feet of torque; with rear-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 17/22 mpg city/highway. The PRO-4X comes with a 4.0-liter dual-overhead-camshaft V-6 and delivers 261 hp and 281 pounds-feet of torque. It gets 14/19 mpg. My test car came with a five-speed automatic transmission and a shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system. A six-speed manual transmission is also available.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Frontier’s interior is nothing fancy, but it’s surprising in its spaciousness and practicality. The PRO-4X’s seats are covered with an attractive black and red cloth upholstery. Leather is also available. The driver and front passenger seats are quite comfortable, though the rear bench seat could use more padding to cushion the ride for adult passengers.\n\nHeadroom and legroom are decent all around, and the crew cab fits five passengers with unexpected ease. As for practicality, there are four cupholders and four bottleholders on the doors. There are plenty of other storage possibilities, including dual glove boxes, a tray atop the dashboard and several smaller trays near the gearshift that are convenient for securing smartphones or wallets. The center console is deep and includes coin slots.\n\nThe center stack, though unattractively covered in black and silver plastic, is refreshing in its simplicity and easy for anyone to operate. My dad had no problem navigating the audio system, which suggests that it’s kind of old school; my children were not able to operate the system, which confirms that it’s old school. It’s modern enough to include satellite radio and an auxiliary jack as standard features.\n\nMy test truck had an upgraded Rockford Fosgate audio system with six-CD changer and auxiliary input, a first-aid kit and a trip computer. Other available options include a sunroof, heated power front seats, heated side mirrors and a roof rack.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample/Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Nissan Frontier received the top rating of Good across all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash-test categories except for rear protection, for which it received an Average rating. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nWhen it comes to family time, you can squeeze in two convertible seats and a booster across the second row’s three-seat bench, but it’s not possible to fit three convertibles. The only thing that compromises front legroom in the crew cab is the installation of a rear-facing infant seat. This compromise is not unique to the Frontier — it happens in many crossovers and SUVs as well.\n\nThe Frontier crew cab has two sets of Latch anchors. Slits in the seat upholstery makes the lower anchors easy to locate and use. The top tethers are on the back of the seats and are accessed by folding the seat forward. Once you fold the seat back into place and lock it, things feel quite secure.\n\nThe 2012 Frontier has standard rear-wheel drive, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Hill start assist and hill descent control are standard on the PRO-4X that I tested as well as other Frontier models with four-wheel drive.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Nissan Frontier here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNissan’s Frontier compact pickup truck comes in King Cab (extended cab) and Crew Cab forms. For 2008, the Frontier remains relatively unchanged except for minor option and feature changes. It is available with a Utili-track system that features movable, heavy-duty tie-down cleats and a spray-in bedliner. Utili-track accessories include sliding trays, bike racks, sliding dividers and modular storage systems. The Frontier is in the same market segment as the Chevrolet Colorado, Dodge Dakota and Ford Ranger.\n\nBoth a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that develops 152 horsepower and 171 pounds-feet of torque and a 4.0-liter V-6 that generates 261 hp and 281 pounds-feet of torque are available. For 2008, the SE trim can be ordered with the four-cylinder. Both rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered. A Nismo package is available that ups the ante for offroad use and includes performance shock absorbers and alloy wheels.\n\nThe Long Bed Crew Cab SE and LE models have a bed that is more than 13 inches longer than the standard Frontier Crew Cab. A front passenger seat belt reminder light and auxiliary audio input jack are standard. A King Cab XE Appearance Package includes a chrome front bumper and 16-inch steel wheels.\n\nExterior\nThe Frontier is 205.5 inches long overall and uses a 125.9-inch wheelbase. King Cab models are 69.7 inches high, while Crew Cab trucks stand 70.1 inches tall. Both are 72.8 inches wide. Crew Cabs have four conventional front-hinged doors, whereas King Cab trucks have rear-hinged back doors.\n\nNissan’s Utility Bed package — a protective bedliner — is now standard on Nismo-equipped King Cab Frontiers.\n\nStyling features include a grille with angled chrome inserts and chrome-plated bumpers. Nissan says the Frontier has short front and rear overhangs and large geometric fender flares. A tube-style roof rack can be installed, and wheels as large as 17 inches in diameter are available. Frontiers use a double-wishbone front suspension, rear leaf springs and rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nInterior\nBecause of its increased exterior dimensions, the Frontier also has grown on the inside. King Cab models get flip-up rear seats. Leather-appointed power seats are available, as are heated seats and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Frontier’s base engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that develops 152 hp and 171 pounds-feet of torque; it has continuous variable valve timing and teams with either a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic. Most trims are equipped with the 4.0-liter V-6, which is rated at 261 hp and 281 pounds-feet of torque. The V-6 can work with either the five-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Nissan’s part-time four-wheel-drive system includes a Low range.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags with rollover protection for both rows of seats are optional.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA 4×4 King Cab Supercharged Value Edition (SVE) joined the Nissan Frontier lineup in 2003, and all models gained electronic brake-force distribution. New 17-inch five-spoke wheels go on the SE models for 2004. A new Supercharger Value Truck Package is available for King Cab pickup trucks.\n\nRedesigned in extra-bold form for 2001, the Tennessee-built Frontier features a front end dominated by a massive bumper. Prominent wheel flares have a bolted-on appearance. The redesigned 2005 Nissan Frontier was unveiled in early January at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.\n\nExterior\nAggressive touches that create what Nissan calls a “modern industrial” look start with the front fascia, hood, fenders and bumper and match up with bold headlights and fog lamps. Nissan does not offer a regular-cab model, but three body styles are available.\n\nKing Cab (extended-cab) pickups feature a 74.6-inch cargo bed, a 116.1-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 202.9 inches. Unlike some extended-cab pickup rivals, the King Cab does not have four doors. Four-door Crew Cab pickups get a 56.3-inch bed and are 199.9 inches long overall with a 116.1-inch wheelbase. The Crew Cab Long Bed model is 217.8 inches long overall, rides a 131.1-inch wheelbase and has a cargo bed that’s 74.6 inches long.\n\nDesert Runner (King Cab) models are offered in XE form. Supercharged (SC) Frontiers have 17-inch alloy wheels, a specially tuned suspension and increased ground clearance for 4×4 versions.\n\nInterior\nKing Cabs come with either a split, three-place front bench seat or two buckets, along with a pair of folding jump seats in the rear. Crew Cabs have front bucket seats and a three-place rear bench. Selected models can have an optional leather-appointed interior with red-on-charcoal stitching.\n\nAll interiors have an instrument panel with three cockpit-style round gauges, as well as a console with side map pockets. Frontiers equipped with the supercharged engine have titanium-colored gauges. A 300-watt Rockford Fosgate-powered audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer is an option for Crew Cab models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe two-wheel-drive King Cab’s base engine is a 143-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder. Standard in Desert Runner, 4×4 and Crew Cab models, the 3.3-liter V-6 yields 180 hp. A supercharged version of the V-6 that cranks out 210 hp goes into the SC and SVE models. All engines are available with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission.\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel antilock brakes are standard. Dual-stage front airbags with a passenger-side cutoff switch are installed.",

      "expert_review": "Full-size trucks are a chore to drive in the city — we know; we’ve done it — so we wanted to see how Nissan’s midsize Frontier would handle an urban environment, as well as a junkyard run to get some used parts.\n\nThere were clear maneuverability and parking advantages that came with this truck’s smaller size, but in one particular way the V-6 Frontier is a lot like its larger siblings — and not in a way you’d want.\n\nIn short, while the V-6 Frontier packs a lot of useful capability in a condensed package, if you’ve had a chance to sit in any of the newer full-size trucks on the market, you may be disappointed with the Frontier’s cabin styling.\n\nTo see a side-by-side comparison of the 2009 and 2010 Frontier, click here.\n\nV-6 Gas Mileage, Performance\nOne of the disappointing elements of the V-6 Frontier — and one that many people in the market for a smaller truck will likely be concerned about — is its gas mileage. With an automatic transmission and four-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 14/19 mpg city/highway, which is similar to what the full-size Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks achieve with V-8 power. If you’re looking for better gas mileage, rear-wheel-drive Frontiers come with a standard four-cylinder engine that gets up to 19/23 mpg with a five-speed manual.\n\nAside from its gas mileage, I like the V-6 drivetrain. The 4.0-liter V-6 makes 261 horsepower (the most of any midsize six-cylinder pickup) and offers strong acceleration when merging on the highway or pulling away from a stoplight.\n\nThe V-6 Frontier I tested had the optional five-speed automatic (a six-speed manual is standard), and the transmission is a smooth-shifting unit. However, it likes to run in a high gear, even when cruising at midrange speeds, to keep engine rpm low and save fuel. This didn’t prove detrimental to performance because the V-6 is so powerful.\n\nSize & Maneuverability\nThe Frontier has grown over the years with various redesigns, a trend that’s affected both trucks and cars. That said, it’s still pretty easy to drive the Frontier in the city.\n\nEven on Chicago’s narrow downtown streets, which are often lined with waiting cars half-pulled to the side of the road, you have a good sense of where the corners of the Frontier are, which enables you to scoot around other vehicles without having to slow to a crawl, as you might in a full-size truck. It’s no more difficult to maneuver the Frontier in a parking garage than it is to pilot a traditional midsize sedan there.\n\nTruck buyers will like the Frontier’s tall stance for improved visibility and ground clearance. The V-6 Frontier I tested was an SE 4×4 trim, and it offers a high seating position that gives you a great view of the road ahead without requiring extra effort to climb into the cab, like some full-size trucks demand.\n\nAn Outdated Cabin\nFull-size truck interior quality has made huge strides in recent years, but compact and midsize trucks — which mostly sell in smaller volumes than do full-size ones — haven’t received the same level of attention. That’s the case with the Frontier, which has fairly basic cabin plastics and finishes that don’t compare well to the newer interiors of the Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram 1500, to name two. And those two don’t cost much more than a V-6 Frontier.\n\nOn the plus side, the Frontier’s cabin is functional and relatively comfortable. The stereo controls are mounted high in the middle of the dash, and I’ve always liked how Nissan’s basic stereo lets you store stations from more than one band on a given set of presets, letting you keep your AM and FM favorites within easy reach. The climate controls are below the stereo, and though they look a bit rudimentary, with only a few knobs and buttons the simple layout equals intuitive operation.\n\nThe Frontier comes with standard cloth bucket seats in front that have comfortable cushioning. Two features absent in the SE trim I tested that I would have liked to have seen were a height-adjustable driver’s seat and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel. (For the record, higher trims do get a height-adjustable driver’s seat.)\n\nThe backseat in the Frontier King Cab (extended cab) is entirely inadequate for adult passengers, though it could likely accommodate children. As opposed to the conventional bench seat in the back of extended-cab full-size trucks, the Frontier King Cab has two tiny individual seats that flip down from the wall of the cab, like a stadium seat. They wouldn’t be very comfortable on a long drive, so if you plan on regularly ferrying passengers in the back of the Frontier, you should consider the four-door crew-cab model. The rear of the King Cab is better suited for securely stowing cargo.\n\nCargo Bed Utility\nThe cargo bed in King Cab models is 73.3 inches long, 58.8 inches wide (44.4 between the wheel wells) and 18 inches tall.\n\nCars.com editor Joe Bruzek took the Frontier on a junkyard run to pick up an exhaust system that was longer than the cargo bed, but he was able to bring it home thanks in part to the available bed extender, which helped hold the end of the exhaust against the lowered tailgate. He noted that when the tailgate is lowered it covers most of the rear bumper, which makes it harder to step down from the cargo bed. The bed extender is easy to remove when it’s not needed, but the tailgate is pretty heavy.\n\nOur test truck had a traditional bedliner, but the Frontier is available with a factory spray-in bedliner and Nissan’s Utili-track rail system for securing cargo in the bed and attaching accessories, like bed dividers.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags. V-6 models add an electronic stability system.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nFrontier in the Market\nThe Frontier is the right-size truck for an urban environment, and with the available V-6 engine it offers decent capability, too, with a large 6,500-pound maximum towing capacity and a 1,541-pound maximum payload rating when properly equipped. There’s more capability to be had by stepping up to a full-size truck, but the larger size is a serious drawback in city driving.\n\nThe as-tested price of our Frontier King Cab 4×4 SE was $26,580, including a few options that added around $1,500 to the final price. The Frontier is available in notably more affordable variations if you want to pass on the V-6 engine and four-wheel drive, but at this price it seems expensive for what you get — especially if the bigness of a full-size truck isn’t a factor where you live — because this price is right in the range of entry-level full-size models.\n\nUnless you’re planning on using the Frontier mainly for commuting — and there are better alternatives for that in the car and crossover world — the greater capability afforded by a full-size model is tough to pass up.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nNissan has the longest history in the U.S. among import automakers of selling compact and midsize pickup trucks. Its current small truck, the Frontier, is available with a choice of four-cylinder or V-6 power, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered. With seating for four or five depending on the cab style, the Frontier competes with the Toyota Tacoma and Honda Ridgeline.\n\nNew for 2013\nA new off-road-oriented Desert Runner trim level debuts for 2013. Available with rear-wheel drive, the Desert Runner features off-road-styled 16-inch alloy wheels, Bilstein-brand off-road shocks, fog lights, special decals and badging, and unique seat cloth with embroidering. There’s also a new Value Truck Package that brings amenities like floormats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a backup camera, rear parking sensors, a bed extender, a trailer hitch, a spray-in bedliner, tie-down points and fog lamps.\n\nNissan says the 2013 Frontier should get better gas mileage thanks to lower engine friction and better aerodynamics thanks to sealing between the cab and truck bed, a lower front spoiler, wind deflectors for the rear tires and a tailgate spoiler.\n\nExteriorThe Frontier is available only in King Cab (extended cab) and crew-cab body styles, with crew-cab SV and SL models offering a long-box option that measures 13 inches longer than the standard bed. Exterior features include:\n\n\nTough PRO-4X and Desert Runner appearance\nOff-road-worthy approach/departure angles\nMuscular but not excessive wheel flares\nAvailable factory spray-in bedliner\nAvailable adjustable tie-down system\nAvailable roof rack on crew-cab models\nAvailable power moonroof\nLocking tailgate\n\nInteriorAll models have supportive, comfortable front bucket seats. Adults have adequate legroom in the rear of the crew cab. Leather seating and a Rockford Fosgate premium stereo are available. The PRO-4X and Desert Runner trucks have unique interiors with custom seating. Interior features include:\n\n\nRemovable underseat storage\nEasy-to-read gauges\nTwo glove boxes\nAvailable heated front seats\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the HoodMechanical features include:\n\n\nBase engine is a 152-horsepower, 2.5-liter, dual-overhead-camshaft inline-four-cylinder that makes 171 pounds-feet of torque\n261-hp, 4.0-liter, dual-overhead-camshaft V-6 that makes 281 pounds-feet of torque\nChoice of a manual or automatic transmission\nAvailable electronically controlled, shift-on-the-fly, part-time transfer case\nElectronic locking rear differential (PRO-4X)\n\n \n\nSafetyThe Frontier offers side curtain airbags as standard equipment and a standard electronic stability system.\n\nHill start assist and hill descent control comes on all four-wheel-drive models with an automatic transmission. Hill descent control allows slow hill descent without constant pressure on the brake pedal. Hill start assist allows the driver to stop on an incline, release the brake and not roll back for two seconds as the driver’s foot moves to the accelerator pedal. Additional safety features include:\n\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "The new Nissan Frontier is the last small, affordable pickup truck. Its starting price of just $19,365 (including destination) is the equivalent of an entry-level Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla but with rugged utility and a bed. It’s a classic case of “you get what you pay for,” however, with a dated, small interior lacking the refinement, features and quality found in the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Honda Ridgeline and Toyota Tacoma (that is, all the other mid-size trucks).\n\nThat may sound damning, but the Pro-4X off-road variant I drove is actually a lovable little truck. The Pro-4X is a classic off-road package with meaty tires, off-road shock absorbers, skid plates, a two-speed transfer case and locking rear differential. It’s a blast to drive while bombing around a recreational off-road park like Bundy Hill Offroad in Michigan, where I did the bulk of my off-roading as a judge for our mid-size truck comparison.\n\nOff-Roading in the Pro-4X\n\nThe Nissan Frontier Pro-4X doesn’t have the electronic gadgetry of the Tacoma’s Crawl Control or the super-smart optional all-wheel drive of the Ridgeline, but when the objective is to have fun at an off-road park, that technology takes the fun out of doing it yourself. (If you’re stuck on the side of a cliff somewhere, on the other hand, then you should probably take all the electronic assistance you can get.) The Pro-4X’s classic way of off-roading relies on communicative steering and simply having a ton of tire grip to dig out of tricky situations. When climbing a steep, sandy hill, the front tires communicate placement very well and make it easy to find the groove with the most grip. The Pro-4X’s tires are a big part of the truck’s proficiency, sized 265/75/16 with tall sidewalls and knobby tread. Being a smaller truck, the Frontier is also more capable around tight trails.\n\nThe Pro-4X is well-protected against off-road punctures with skid plates under the fuel tank, oil pan and transfer case. There’s an electronic rear differential for when things get dicey that locks so the rear wheels spin at the same speed; as a result, even if one is spinning in mud or is up in the air, the other tire with traction gets equal pounds-feet torque so it can keep pushing forward.    \n\nAs a Daily Driver\n\nWith the Pro-4X treatment, the Nissan Frontier is a difficult truck to live with on paved roads. The ride is bouncy, and wind and road noise are always there. At highway speeds, the knobby tires howl while wind whistles past the cabin; 60 mph in a Frontier feels like 90 mph in any other mid-size truck. The Colorado and Canyon, even in off-road select trims, better isolate drivers from outside noises, though they also have less aggressive tires. The Honda Ridgeline has a carlike architecture, so it’s more like driving a family SUV than a truck — which could be a plus or a minus depending on what you want out of a truck. The Frontier also has a huge turning circle, which means a three-point turn is more like a four- or five-point. \n\nGetting up to speed is tedious for occupants hearing the coarse, grainy-sounding engine. Accelerator responsiveness is good, however, even with a dated five-speed automatic transmission versus competitors’ six- and eight-speeds (the Frontier has an option for a six-speed manual).There’s decent engine grunt from a stop.\n\nCabin quality is awful, with hard plastics throughout, cheap painted silver accents and soft, orange backlighting that looks 20 years old. The navigation and touchscreen technology are also dated: The 5.5-inch screen on my iPhone 7 Plus is almost as big as the Frontier’s optional 5.8-inch navigation touchscreen; this touchscreen is standard on the Pro-4X. That pales in comparison with the Chevrolet and GMC, in which Apple CarPlay or Android Auto uses your phone’s native navigation to display maps and routes on an 8-inch touchscreen, so there’s no need to pay for an optional navigation system if you have a smartphone and an active data plan.   \n\nCabin comfort is also lacking compared with the other trucks’ larger interiors. The Nissan Frontier is compact in size and the cabin is narrower than others, which offer legitimately mid-size interiors in crew-cab Canyons, Colorados or Tacomas; the Ridgeline is only a four-door, and roomier, too. At a slender 6 feet tall, I wasn’t comfortable in the Frontier’s backseat because of its flat cushioning and elevated knee position. My knees were touching the front seatback where I had positioned it to drive. \n\nTowing and Cargo\n\nThe Nissan Frontier crew cab with rear-wheel drive, SL trim level and V-6 engine can tow a maximum of 6,710 pounds. A Colorado with a V-6 is rated to tow 7,000 pounds in any cab or drive configuration, and 7,700 pounds with an optional diesel four-cylinder, while the Tacoma V-6 rear-wheel-drive extended cab is rated at a maximum 6,800 pounds and the Ridgeline is a maximum 5,000 pounds with all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Nissan Frontier has the lowest crashworthiness ratings of mid-size pickups tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. At the top of the 2018 list is the Honda Ridgeline, followed by the Toyota Tacoma and Chevrolet Colorado (crew cab only) with equal ratings. In federal crash tests, the Frontier lags other trucks in its front crashworthiness, though it earns similar overall ratings. Not offered is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking like the Ridgeline, which is the only truck in the class to offer the feature.  \n\nIn the Market\n\nThough the Nissan Frontier’s starting price is $1,500 less than a 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ($19,365 versus $20,940 with destination charges), in higher select trims there’s less pricing disparity. My test truck, a Pro-4X with optional equipment, totaled $37,000. A similar off-road package on the Colorado, the Z71 with a V-6 and four-wheel drive, starts at $36,775  for a significantly more refined and well-rounded truck, though perhaps with fewer off-road chops from the factory; a good pair of tires could help it play catchup, or there’s the ultimate off-road mid-sizer, the $41,000 ZR2.   \n\nBoth the Pro-4X and Z71 give you crew cabs and short boxes, two-speed transfer case, locking rear differential, off-road shocks, hill descent control, heated front seats and a backup camera. Where the Nissan Frontier’s value comes back swinging is that it also includes a moonroof (which isn’t an option on any Colorado), dual climate control instead of single, leather interior versus cloth and a roof rack. Does that make the Frontier worth the money? Well, that depends how often you’ll be driving off-road versus on.  \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2010 about the 2010 Nissan Frontier. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFull-size trucks are a chore to drive in the city — we know; we’ve done it — so we wanted to see how Nissan’s midsize Frontier would handle an urban environment, as well as a junkyard run to get some used parts.\n\nThere were clear maneuverability and parking advantages that came with this truck’s smaller size, but in one particular way the V-6 Frontier is a lot like its larger siblings — and not in a way you’d want.\n\nIn short, while the V-6 Frontier packs a lot of useful capability in a condensed package, if you’ve had a chance to sit in any of the newer full-size trucks on the market, you may be disappointed with the Frontier’s cabin styling.\n\nTo see a side-by-side comparison of the 2009 and 2010 Frontier, click here.\n\nV-6 Gas Mileage, Performance\nOne of the disappointing elements of the V-6 Frontier — and one that many people in the market for a smaller truck will likely be concerned about — is its gas mileage. With an automatic transmission and four-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 14/19 mpg city/highway, which is similar to what the full-size Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks achieve with V-8 power. If you’re looking for better gas mileage, rear-wheel-drive Frontiers come with a standard four-cylinder engine that gets up to 19/23 mpg with a five-speed manual.\n\nAside from its gas mileage, I like the V-6 drivetrain. The 4.0-liter V-6 makes 261 horsepower (the most of any midsize six-cylinder pickup) and offers strong acceleration when merging on the highway or pulling away from a stoplight.\n\nThe V-6 Frontier I tested had the optional five-speed automatic (a six-speed manual is standard), and the transmission is a smooth-shifting unit. However, it likes to run in a high gear, even when cruising at midrange speeds, to keep engine rpm low and save fuel. This didn’t prove detrimental to performance because the V-6 is so powerful.\n\nSize & Maneuverability\nThe Frontier has grown over the years with various redesigns, a trend that’s affected both trucks and cars. That said, it’s still pretty easy to drive the Frontier in the city.\n\nEven on Chicago’s narrow downtown streets, which are often lined with waiting cars half-pulled to the side of the road, you have a good sense of where the corners of the Frontier are, which enables you to scoot around other vehicles without having to slow to a crawl, as you might in a full-size truck. It’s no more difficult to maneuver the Frontier in a parking garage than it is to pilot a traditional midsize sedan there.\n\nTruck buyers will like the Frontier’s tall stance for improved visibility and ground clearance. The V-6 Frontier I tested was an SE 4×4 trim, and it offers a high seating position that gives you a great view of the road ahead without requiring extra effort to climb into the cab, like some full-size trucks demand.\n\nAn Outdated Cabin\nFull-size truck interior quality has made huge strides in recent years, but compact and midsize trucks — which mostly sell in smaller volumes than do full-size ones — haven’t received the same level of attention. That’s the case with the Frontier, which has fairly basic cabin plastics and finishes that don’t compare well to the newer interiors of the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500, to name two. And those two don’t cost much more than a V-6 Frontier.\n\nOn the plus side, the Frontier’s cabin is functional and relatively comfortable. The stereo controls are mounted high in the middle of the dash, and I’ve always liked how Nissan’s basic stereo lets you store stations from more than one band on a given set of presets, letting you keep your AM and FM favorites within easy reach. The climate controls are below the stereo, and though they look a bit rudimentary, with only a few knobs and buttons the simple layout equals intuitive operation.\n\nThe Frontier comes with standard cloth bucket seats in front that have comfortable cushioning. Two features absent in the SE trim I tested that I would have liked to have seen were a height-adjustable driver’s seat and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel. (For the record, higher trims do get a height-adjustable driver’s seat.)\n\nThe backseat in the Frontier King Cab (extended cab) is entirely inadequate for adult passengers, though it could likely accommodate children. As opposed to the conventional bench seat in the back of extended-cab full-size trucks, the Frontier King Cab has two tiny individual seats that flip down from the wall of the cab, like a stadium seat. They wouldn’t be very comfortable on a long drive, so if you plan on regularly ferrying passengers in the back of the Frontier, you should consider the four-door crew-cab model. The rear of the King Cab is better suited for securely stowing cargo.\n\nCargo Bed Utility\nThe cargo bed in King Cab models is 73.3 inches long, 58.8 inches wide (44.4 inches between the wheel wells) and 18 inches tall.\n\nCars.com editor Joe Bruzek took the Frontier on a junkyard run to pick up an exhaust system that was longer than the cargo bed, but he was able to bring it home thanks in part to the available bed extender, which helped hold the end of the exhaust against the lowered tailgate. He noted that when the tailgate is lowered it covers most of the rear bumper, which makes it harder to step down from the cargo bed. The bed extender is easy to remove when it’s not needed, but the tailgate is pretty heavy.\n\nOur test truck had a traditional bedliner, but the Frontier is available with a factory spray-in bedliner and Nissan’s Utili-track rail system for securing cargo in the bed and attaching accessories, like bed dividers.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags. V-6 models add an electronic stability system.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nFrontier in the Market\nThe Frontier is the right-size truck for an urban environment, and with the available V-6 engine it offers decent capability, too, with a large 6,500-pound maximum towing capacity and a 1,541-pound maximum payload rating when properly equipped. There’s more capability to be had by stepping up to a full-size truck, but the larger size is a serious drawback in city driving.\n\nThe as-tested price of our Frontier King Cab 4×4 SE was $26,580, including a few options that added around $1,500 to the final price. The Frontier is available in notably more affordable variations if you want to pass on the V-6 engine and four-wheel drive, but at this price it seems expensive for what you get — especially if the bigness of a full-size truck isn’t a factor where you live — because this price is right in the range of entry-level full-size models.\n\nUnless you’re planning on using the Frontier mainly for commuting — and there are better alternatives for that in the car and crossover world — the greater capability afforded by a full-size model is tough to pass up.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "According to the official corporate mythology, the inspiration for Nissan’s new Frontier pickup styling was high-end power tools. It is itself, after all (so the argument goes), a power tool, with the same emphasis on a melding of beauty and functionality. Be that as it may, it’s a brilliant conception that sets the Frontier aside from anything else out there, and produces the same slack-jawed response among young males as those female-pop-star soda commercials.\n\nNissan’s studies have suggested that about 80 percent of Frontier buyers will be male, the rest being a species that is known to appreciate the kind of bodybuilder lines with which the machine is imbued. (One is Diane Allen, Nissan chief designer at the La Jolla, Calif. studio which came up with the radically new look. She said a secondary consideration was to echo some of the design clues embodied in the Xterra SUV, Nissan’s youth-oriented, entry-level machine.)\n\nNissan lists permutations of Frontier, considering cab design, trim level and powertrain. It starts down at an astonishingly low base price of $11,699 for a 4×2 regular cab with 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission. At that price, I could be persuaded to keep one around strictly for hauling garden supplies.\n\nOn the march to the lavishly-endowed series they put in the press fleet, there are 2x4s and 4x4s, with regular cabs, king cabs and crew cabs, 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines, Spartan XE trim and plusher SE fittings, manual transmissions and automatics, and ultimately, a supercharged 6-cylinder variant. That’s what I played with for a week, with Crew Cab, 4-wheel drive and a 5-speed manual transmission. Base price on that one is $24,049, double the entry-level offering. An automatic transmission, which I’d be inclined to go for, would add $1,050.\n\nIt soon becomes apparent that the Frontier is not just a pretty face. The inside has been massaged, too, with new gauges and steering wheel, new audio options and a luxurious (optional) leather seating package. The supercharged versions have distinctive red-on-charcoal stitching for a sporty flair.\n\nA King Cab means an extended passenger compartment with only two doors. Best thing you can do with that arrangement is consider the rear seating area a trunk. The non-spry need not apply. A Crew Cab, the four-door machine, also provides the passenger-hauling capability, in a more usable form, and, like the King Cab, it allows the driver and navigator to tilt their seats back from the near-vertical angle of the regular cab. Trucks without that ability are hard to live with.\n\nKing Cab and Crew Cab series sit on a 116-inch wheelbase and are 200 inches long, with rear bumper. The regular cab versions have a 104-inch wheelbase and are 185 inches overall. In the King and Crew, space utilization is biased toward people, with a bed volume of 33 cubic feet, about what you’d get in two mid-size cars. Des pite its abbreviated overall length, the regular cab truck affords 44 cubic feet for manure and such. On the stretches, the bed is 4 inches shy of 5 feet long, but this can be extended by dropping the tailgate. Width is nearly 5 feet, sure to please those who deal in plywood sheets (long-load flag optional and extra).\n\nI found the second-class compartment on the Crew Cab adequate for two amateur Sumos such as I, three skinny chicks or kids or one serious dog. It would help in most cases to have a giving person up front. It’s worth bearing in mind that in addition to livery duties, the back of a four-door pickup provides greatly enhanced security for gear with easy accessibility.\n\nIn its sparest form, a Frontier weighs 3,817; at the high end, 4,208. Nissan says a properly equipped Frontier can tow up to 5,000 pounds (automatic transmission, 3,500 with 5-speed manual). Even unladen, that’s a hefty load for the four-banger, which produces 143 hp (@5,200 rpm) and 154 f unds of torque (@4,000). Better to move up to the 3.3-liter single-overhead-cam V-6, which provides 170 hp (@4,800) and 200 foot-pounds of torque @2,800). If you’re really into towing or hauling, and especially if you want the 4×4 drivetrain with automatic, you’d be well advised to go for the supercharged version of the V-6. It makes 210 hp (@4,800) and 246 foot-pounds (w. automatic) or 231 (5-speed) at 2,800 rpm.\n\nUnlike a turbo, which gets it on when the engine starts spinning fast, a supercharger, belt driven off the crankshaft, provides truck-friendly low-end grunt as well as a kick in the pants at elevated speeds.\n\nIn the test machine, it felt more like a small pushrod V-8, with good launch feel and the flexibility to be effective at a wide range of speeds. It does want premium fuel, unlike its more delicate brethren. The EPA rates the supercharged 4×4 Crew Cab at 15 mpg city, 18 highway. I logged 16.1, with a mix of freeway flying, around-town pottering and some 4×4 testing.\n\nWith a wheelbase equal to what you’d find on a large car, and not unduly aggressive shocks and springs, the Frontier has a surprisingly good ride, with decent nastiness filtering and little jiggle unladen, although it did smooth a bit with a few hundred pounds’ worth of cargo. It was surprisingly quiet, too, and was a fooler on the highway, running considerably faster than seat-of-the-pants intuition suggested.\n\nThe four instruments are black on off-white by day, and reverse at night. I thought they were hard to see on sunny days when I was wearing sunglasses, fine at night. Why only four? With a supercharger, a boost gauge would be amusing, and oil temperature and pressure gauges useful, as well as adding to the industrial-chic ambience.\n\nThe optional leather seating areas were very attractive, worthy of a luxury sedan, and decently supportive.\n\nThe SC variants are equipped like low-end luxury cars, with all the power goodies and niceties such as fog lamps, roof rack, locking/removable tailgate, air conditioning, keyless entry and a 6-speaker, 100-watt AM-FM-CD audio system.The stereo was of good quality, but left an opportunity for aftermarketers.\n\nThe SCs come with 17-inch alloy wheels housed in hefty 265/55 rubber. The generous tires contributed to a feeling of stability on curvy roads, and helped braking on dry roads approach the passenger-car norm. Stopping was aided by antilock, which is standard, along with frontal air bags.\n\nThe Frontier fared quite well in the government’s crash tests. On a scale of five, it won a four-star rating for protection of the driver in a frontal impact, and fives for navigator frontal impact and side protection, front and rear.\n\nIt did considerably less well in the Insurance Institute’s more demanding offset barrier crashes, garnering an overall rating of poor. Footwell intrusion produced what they estimated would be serious injuries to the driver’s feet. In a series of four barrier tests at 5 mph, the Frontier tested (a ’98 model) suffered more than $4,000 damage, not atypical of the class. Build quality at the Smyrna, Tenn. plant was very good.\n\nThe test platform had the “supercharger value package” ($1,549), consisting of leather seats, six-CD changer, steering wheel controls for cruise and radio, a security system, cruise control, pop-up sunroof and tilt wheel; special floor mats, $79; bedliner, $309, and bed extender, $229. Total, with freight, was $26,735.\n\nWorth checking: Similar compact pickups like GMC Sonoma, Ford Ranger and Chevrolet S-10, or the somewhat larger Dakota, which offers a choice between two V-8s.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "For several years, consumers in Thailand, Brazil and certain other overseas markets have been able to purchase and drive a vehicle never sold in the United States – a compact pickup truck with a full four-door cabin. Never sold, that is, until Nissan recently unveiled its 2000 Frontier Crew Cab. Until now, other manufacturers – notably Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. – have offered so-called rear access doors on selected models. But the Frontier is the first compact truck in the United States to feature four full-size forward-hinged doors.\n\nAnd that’s about the best compliment we can pay to a truck which otherwise is strictly middle-of-the-road.\n\nHe: There’s just not much to set the Frontier apart from the competition. This would otherwise be just a two-star design, but I’m giving the Crew Cab three stars because Nissan is the first to offer a real four-door model in this segment. That’s not to say the Frontier still isn’t full of compromises.\n\nShe: For the first time in my life, I was thrilled that I didn’t have a driver’s-side vanity mirror. I was a victim of a bad haircut and when I got out of the salon and tried to examine myself in the mirror, there was nothing there. God works in mysterious ways. Or should I say, Jerry Hirschberg and the Nissan designers. I’m really surprised. Wasn’t he a former rock star? You’d think he’d be vain enough to want a vanity mirror in there.\n\nHe: He probably designed it on a bad-hair day, too.\n\nShe: I know I’m probably shallow for starting on that harangue, so I will temper that with a compliment. The Frontier is lots of truck for under $20,000. Our test vehicle had a base price of $18,340 and a bottom line of $19,940. The seats were cloth and the interior was fairly austere. But if you need to haul up to five people and lots of equipment comfortably, this is a decent truck – even if you do give up about 18 inches of bed space for that extra room in the cabin. But the Frontier still has no personality. Couldn’t they at least have thrown a couple Tasmanian Devil decals on it, or something?\n\nHe: Maybe they should have just hired you, the Hamtramck Devil, to do their marketing. But you didn’t finish telling people what they get for their 20 grand. The Frontier Crew Cab has the single-overhead-cam 3.3-liter V-6, which makes 170 horsepower. Our test vehicle was fitted with the standard five-speed manual gearbox, but you can order a four-speed automatic. With either transmission, however, the V-6 still feels underpowered, especially if you have more than one or two people on board. And even with the manual, you get only about 16 miles per gallon in city driving, according to the EPA. Nissan carried over the suspension and most of the sheet metal on the 2000 model, which has the odd feel of being built with yesterday’s technology. Nothing really looks or feels fresh on this truck.\n\nShe: So why are you giving it three stars?\n\nHe: Because I can haul my svelte c arcass into the rear without having to squeeze through one of those awful rear half-doors, like you get on the Ford Ranger or the Chevy S10.\n\nShe: You mentioned the old suspension. Nissan uses the regular 4×4 chassis for the Crew Cab, so even the two-wheel-drive model sits up high. That stopped me from picking up my grandma for church on Sunday because I knew I’d never get her up into it. And it reminded me of those compromises you were talking about. The Crew Cab has an old-style leaf-spring suspension with a solid axle in the rear. Without getting too technical, I can tell you the ride was bumpy and bouncy. Don’t be fooled by the four doors. You won’t get a sedan ride. You’re going to feel like you’re driving on a Texas back road in this truck.\n\nHe: If you think about it, that’s probably a large part of the Frontier’s appeal. I mean, all you have to do is look at the name. It evokes images of the Wild West and freedom and all those goofy guy things. What manly truck owne even want a vanity mirror, for Pete’s sake?\n\nShe: I was glad there wasn’t a vanity mirror, remember? I was just a little bit bummed that our test vehicle didn’t have some of the neat Nissan accessories. You can get a tubular-style roof rack to carry skis or snowboards. And a bed-mounted bike rack. And a bed extender – every man’s fantasy.\n\n2000 Nissan Frontier 4×2 XE Crew Cab\n\nAnita’s rating: acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating:above average\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger pickup truck\n\nPrice: Base, $18,340; as tested, $19,940 (including $520 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 3.3-liter V-6; 170 hp at 4,800 rpm; 200 lb-ft torque at 2,800 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 mpg city/19 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,133 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Smyrna, Tenn.\n\nWhat we liked: Full four-door design enables much easier access to rear compartment; lots more legroom for rear passengers; four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard; fairly austere cabin, but the under-$20,000 sticker is attractive\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Nondescript styling; V-6 engine feels anemic; no side air bags available; two-wheel-drive model sits as high as a 4×4, making climb up into; cabin difficult for short people; feels like yesterday’s technology.",

      "expert_review": "Frontier. The term conjures an image of the outer limits of man’s knowledge. In the case of the supercharged Nissan Frontier, it describes a place (niche market?) other manufacturers haven’t explored, which probably is a good thing. But we travel to that place today to drive the 2003 Nissan Frontier 4×4 SCV6 pickup, a vehicle that pushes the boundaries of what we expect in a small pickup truck, but, in the end, leaves you wondering why it was built in the first place.\n\nIt wasn’t all that long ago that a small pickup fit a far different niche. Inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to own. Not particularly powerful, but able to lug a decent-sized load.\n\nThe Frontier we tested was none of the above: It was plushly appointed, expensive ($28,746 as tested), supercharged (210 horsepower, 246 ft.-lbs of torque), required premium fuel, and got 16 miles per gallon.\n\nThat certainly puts the Frontier in its own corner of the small-pickup world. But there are plenty of other corners. You can get them with long beds or short beds, two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and with all sorts of engine and transmission combinations. Ditto for trim levels. And need we mention regular, king, or crew cabs?\n\nTo configure a small truck can confuse the buyer.\n\nIt’s just that this one is neither toy nor workhorse, people-mover or single-person’s sports vehicle. It has a powerful “Bob the Builder” facade with fake bolts designed into the cladding, but this configuration doesn’t make it a hard-working rig, with its short bed and fancy appointments.\n\nIn fact, it would be interesting to see just who drives this truck.\n\nAnd it is a nice-enough truck to drive  if you’re the driver or front-seat passenger. The seats are comfortable, and there’s almost enough legroom for the driver. One more click on the adjuster would be just right.\n\nSame with the performance. The Frontier, while quick, didn’t have snap-your-head acceleration. Instead, it spun its wheels anytime there was moisture on the road and the gas pedal got anything more than a light push. And, once the supercharger kicks in, it’s noisy, very noisy.\n\nSimilarly, when stopping, the antilock brake system kicked in regularly with the front disc/rear drum braking system. (Yes, we drove it mostly in the rain.) But the P265/65417 tires weren’t coated with “Stick-Um,” either.\n\nThe interior, a gray leather with neat red stitching and SC badging was plenty plush. But to say this crew cab is designed for five is to assume that those riding in the back are very small people. Getting back there solo, I didn’t fit. My head was jammed against the (fabric) headliner, and my knees were jammed against the seatbacks.\n\nThe controls present a similar conflict of sensations. Visibility is excellent. Gauges and controls are Nissan standard and intuitive  except for the radio. Nissan has its own s tyle for audio systems, and it works fine once you understand it. This was a 300-watt Rockford Fosgate system with 6-disc in-dash CD changer, controls on the steering wheel, and plenty of clarity out of the nine speakers.\n\nOn the roof, there was a tubular rack that certainly wasn’t designed to haul piles of plywood to the job site on a daily basis. But the matching tubular side rails were sturdy enough to aid the big step up into the not-so-big truck.\n\nOne thing that confirms that this is a truck is the ride. Nissan uses a leaf-spring rear suspension that will allow you to carry a load, but causes bouncing when the bed is empty. Similarly, the recirculating-ball steering, to be kind, is far short of precise.\n\nNow, to read all of the above is to think that this is a dog of a vehicle.\n\nOn the contrary. It’s fun to drive once you get acclimated to it, which takes no more than half an hour. It should have Nissan’s reliability and everything wo ks as designed. The fit and finish were fine. It cruises the highways just fine (we’ll always remember it for giving us our first trip through the Liberty Tunnel in the first 24 hours it was open), and the high seats give great visibility. Available options that weren’t on our test vehicle included a tire pressure monitoring system and large-sized sunroof.\n\nIt’s just that the design makes one ask: “Why?”\n\nAs in: Why would Nissan build this version? Why would anyone buy it at this high price?\n\nAnd, for that, I have no answer.\n\nThe good news is Nissan has a new full-size pickup  the Titan  coming on the market as an early 2004 model and a redesign of the Frontier coming for the 2005 model year. It’s one time when the term “new Frontier” is appropriate. Both vehicles will merit a long look.\n\nUntil then, file this one under “high-powered-but-directionless.” Of course, a lot of potential buyers fit that description, too. As our North Shore realtor, Tracy Mousseau, always says about houses: “There’s a derriere for every seat.”\n\nLikes: Interior appointments and controls. The cupholders. On first look, they seemed too shallow but they held both my massive Kane’s Donuts plastic mug and smaller metal version. Three outlet plugs for phones, laptops, television sets, and the like.\n\nAnnoyances: The bouncy ride, a near-useless rear seat, noisy engine, and poor fuel economy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNissans compact pickup truck gets a new body style for 2002. The regular Crew Cab model has a 56.3-inch cargo box, while the Crew Cab Long Beds cargo box measures 74.6 inches in length. The Long Bed model also rides a wheelbase that is 15 inches longer than the regular version.\n\nA new instrument panel with three cockpit style round gauges, a console with side map pockets and a bigger glove box go into all Frontier cabs. Responding to complaints about the previous Frontiers pull-type parking brake, Nissan installed a foot-operated version for 2002. A Rockford Fosgate-powered audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer is a new option for Crew Cab models.\n\nRedesigned in extra-bold form for 2001, the Tennessee-built Frontier features a front end dominated by a massive bumper. Prominent wheel flares have a bolted-on appearance. Nissan was the first manufacturer to offer a Crew Cab pickup with four conventional, front-hinged doors. A four-cylinder and two 3.3-liter V-6 engines, available in regular or supercharged forms, are offered for 2002.\n\nExterior\nNissan no longer offers a regular-cab model, but three body styles are available. King Cab (extended-cab) pickups are equipped with a 74.6-inch cargo bed and have a 116.1-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 202.9 inches. Unlike some rival extended-cab pickups, the King Cab does not have four doors. Four-door Crew Cab pickups get a 56.3-inch bed and are 199.9 inches long with a 116.1-inch wheelbase. The new Crew Cab Long Bed model is 217.8 inches long overall and rides a 131.1-inch wheelbase and has a cargo bed thats 74.6 inches long.\n\nDesert Runner models are offered in XE, SE and S/C forms and are equipped with two-wheel drive. They have the same heavy-duty chassis, ride height and stance as a 4×4. Supercharged (S/C) Frontiers have 17-inch alloy wheels and a specially tuned suspension with a raised ground clearance for 4x4s.\n\nInterior\nKing Cabs come with either a split, three-place, front bench seat or two buckets, along with a pair of folding jump seats in the rear. Crew Cabs have front bucket seats and a three-place rear bench. A bench seat is standard in the regular cab, and bucket seats are optional. SE and S/C models can have an optional leather-appointed interior with red-on-charcoal stitching. Frontiers with the supercharged engine have titanium-colored gauges.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine for the Frontier is a 143-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The optional supercharged, 3.3-liter V-6 makes 210 hp with a five-speed-manual shift, but it cranks out 231 hp with an automatic transmission. Occupying a middle ground, the regular 3.3-liter V-6 yields a more modest 170 hp. All engines are available with either a five-speed-manual or four-speed-automatic transmission. The supercharged engine is available on the S/C Desert Runner, S/C 4×4 King Cab, S/C Crew Cab and the new Crew Cab Long Bed models.\n\nNissans four-wheel-drive system can be engaged at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour by using a floor-mounted shift lever. Four-wheel-drive models with the four-cylinder engine have manual front hubs that must be engaged or disengaged by hand while the vehicle is stopped. Frontiers with a V-6 engine have automatic front hubs.\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel antilock brakes are standard on V-6 and Crew Cab models. All others come only with rear antilock brakes. Dual-stage front airbags with a passenger-side cutoff switch are installed.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
