      "expert_review": "Nissan thinks inexpensive subcompact sedans are not dead even as some manufacturers give up on small cars. And with the redesigned 2020 Versa, the brand is staking a claim for a bigger slice of remaining sales, as well as keeping a starter car for the brand.\n\nRelated: 2020 Nissan Versa Not the Cheapest New Car, But It’s a Helluva Better Value\n\nThe previous Versa’s claim to fame was the lowest price tag in America for a new car — and it looked and drove like it. It was basic transportation with the payment you might need but not the car you really wanted. Nissan says the 2020 Versa’s focus remains value in a car you could want. Nissan has given it desirable, even unexpected features and safety tech that get sweeter as you climb from the S through the SV and new SR trim levels. And the base price, while at the lower end of the class, is up from a used-car-like $13,355 to $15,625 with a stick shift (all prices include $895 destination charges). Realistically, most U.S. buyers will want the $1,670 automatic option, which makes the ante $17,295 (find full details on pricing here). The SV and SR have the automatic standard.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nNissan showed off the new Versa at an event in Nashville, Tenn., with driving in the city and in the surrounding hill country. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for travel and lodging for such automaker-sponsored events.) Driving a cheap subcompact might not be on everyone’s bucket list, but I was interested to see if the Versa delivers on the promise of a decent new car for people with less than $20,000 to spend. I drove both the base Versa S and top-of-the-line SR trim level (still just under $20,000), and the short answer is that it does.\n\nSafety Tech for the People\n\nThey aren’t the sexiest features, but standard safety tech is basic to good value, and even the Versa S includes standard front automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection (up to 37 mph), rear automatic braking (up to 9 mph), a lane departure warning system (that vibrates the wheel quietly) and automatic headlights and high beams. The SV and SR add a standard blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a rear door alert that signals if you opened the door at the start of a drive and don’t check the backseat again after you park, a driver alertness warning and adaptive grid lines for the backup camera. A $300 option for the SR adds adaptive cruise control, which is unusual for subcompacts. You won’t find any of those on the old Versa, and rivals — including the Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent — offer fewer such features or restrict them to fewer trim levels.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nLow tech, but also important for safety, is the Versa’s good visibility thanks to a beltline that dips low and side mirrors relocated lower on the door from their previous location higher and farther forward. The sightlines over the shoulder and to the rear also are good.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nWhile driving fun is not a hallmark of subcompacts, I expected a bit more from the Versa because it shares a platform with Nissan’s Kicks, whose nimbleness is among reasons the Kicks is a favorite city car of mine. The 2020 Versa exhibits similar dynamics — not much go power, but unexpected agility.\n\nThe 2020 Versa uses the same 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, which puts out a mere 114 pounds-feet of torque. It’s paired with a five-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic that’s reasonably well behaved in terms of CVT drone or rubber-band feel. The powertrain is enough for the light sedan (about 2,600 to 2,700 pounds’ curb weight depending on trim level) to feel a little peppy in city traffic. Floor it, however, and it bogs for a couple of beats off the line before gathering momentum with somewhat more noise than urgency.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nMore surprising is the Versa’s combination of competent handling and decent ride. Cornering brings minimal lean, and the chassis isn’t busy or floaty on the highway. If you really push it, you get more body roll along with more tire-scrubbing understeer, but why would you? Agility is noticeably better with the SR’s 17-inch alloy wheels and wider rubber than in the S with its 15-inch steel wheels and skinnier tires. Steering is light but crisp, while braking feel (discs in front, drums in the rear) is a little soft but predictable. The Versa also delivers a comfortable ride. There was some choppiness when the pavement got rough, but it was never harsh.\n\nThe EPA had not posted fuel economy ratings as of this writing, but Nissan estimates they will be 32/40/35 mpg city/highway/combined with the CVT, a mile better on each than the 2019. You’ll pay more for DIY shifting: The manual comes in at just 30 mpg combined. By comparison, the Yaris, Rio and Accent with automatics deliver up to 35, 32 and 32 mpg combined, respectively.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nSleeker Look, Still Compact-Car Room\n\nThe formerly dowdy Versa now wears a scaled-down version of the new Altima’s lines, deep V-Motion grille and hint of a “floating roof” with a back pillar divided by black trim. But it doesn’t take advantage of it with a contrast-color roof option or some of the other color personalization options that give its Kicks cousin a dose of fun.\n\nThe Versa continues to offer almost compact-car passenger room along with more than compact-car trunk space of 14.7 cubic feet (the 2020 Toyota Corolla has 13.1 cubic feet) that’s expandable with a 60/40-split, folding rear seatback and large pass-through. The car is slightly bigger at 1.6 inches longer and 1.8 inches wider and has an adult-size backseat that gave me plenty of legroom to sit behind my 6-foot-2 self in front. But the sleeker roofline is 2.3 inches lower, which left my head brushing the ceiling in the rear. Front and rear seats were comfortable, though both test cars needed a little more padding in the seat cushions. The cloth upholstery was more interesting on the SV and SR with contrasting colors and stitching, but the base cloth had a decent feel if a duller look.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nKicks Style and More Tech\n\nIf you like the interior design of the Kicks, you’ll like the redone Versa. It picks up the Kicks design and dashboard with a 7-inch center touchscreen on all models. The Versa’s top two trim levels also have a 7-inch configurable screen serving as the instrument panel, unusual for the class, as well as a swath of soft-touch stitched vinyl across the face of the dash. The center screen includes volume and tuning knobs along with shortcut buttons that have a quality feel. The SV and SR also add Nissan Connect with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, satellite radio capability and steering wheel controls with voice recognition.\n\nThe Versa’s features-per-dollar peak in the new SR with standard LED headlights and daytime running lights, remote engine start, automatic climate control and a leather wrap for the D-shaped steering wheel and shift knob. Heated front seats are an option. But even the base model gets Bluetooth streaming along with remote keyless entry and push-button start. And all trim levels have USB and 12-volt ports under the dash in a generous phone cubby and two more USB ports at the rear of the center “console,” which is really a plastic tray with a couple of shallow cubbies and cupholders but no covered bin to hide your valuables.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa S | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nApart from the console, other cost-cutting was apparent inside even if features and tech offset it.  As expected in this price range, there is plenty of hard plastic used, particularly in the S. The driver’s seat gets a fold-down inboard armrest only on the SV and above. The front passenger goes without both the armrest and seat height adjustment.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nToyota’s Yaris Hatchback Back for 2020, and It’s a Mazda\n2018 Nissan Kicks Review: Impressive Value and Utility Without AWD\n2018 Kia Rio Review: A Respectable Redesign in an Unrespected Class\n2018 Hyundai Accent Review: Sensible Trumps Sexy\n2018 Honda Fit Review: First Drive\nValue Delivered\n\nThe 2020 Versa hits all the right notes for value for a wide range of shoppers, though it’s light on driving fun. The sticker price is low enough to be a starter car even with the $18,535 SV that adds a lot of desirable features or the SR at less than $20,000. It has safety and space that could attract small families or make you feel OK putting a young driver in it. The footprint suits city streets and parking. The styling and interior design and tech now require no apology. Nissan says its research shows there are buyers for small sedans — particularly among millennial, Generation X and multicultural shoppers — and has put together a very credible Versa to attract them. In fact, the toughest competition might be its own Kicks cousin.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa SR | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The refreshed 2023 Nissan Versa will make its auto show debut in Miami Saturday with a new face and more user-friendly interior. A larger available touchscreen, wireless charging and a new S Plus Package for the base trim better position the Versa to compete against its subcompact rivals, but one key question remains: How much will it cost?\n\nRelated: 2020 Nissan Versa Review: Not as Cheap, Much Better Value\n\nMinor Updates Outside, Bigger Changes Inside\n\nThe 2023 Versa will come in three trims: S, SV and SR. Base S standard features include cloth seats, 15-inch wheels, a four-speaker audio system, three USB ports and keyless entry. The SV adds a push-button start, a 7-inch configurable gauge cluster, 16-inch alloy wheels, body-color door handles and mirrors, upgraded cloth seats and 60/40-split, folding rear seats. The SR gets sporty exterior and interior elements, plus black painted mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, a six-speaker audio system and a Wi-Fi hot spot.\n\nFollowing the lead of its larger Altima sibling, the 2023 Versa’s exterior tweaks include an updated front end with a redesigned grille, new logos and a new wheel design for the top SR model. The SV and SR also add Gray Sky Pearl exterior paint to their list of options.\n\nMore substantial improvements are seen in the Versa’s tech and convenience features. The base S trim misses out on the wireless charging pad and larger 8-inch touchscreen standard in higher trims, but an available S Plus Package adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 60/40-split, folding rear seat and 16-inch alloy wheels (all were previously reserved for higher trims). Additionally, a new center console with an armrest is standard on SV and SR trims.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n2023 Nissan Versa | Manufacturer image\n\nFor 2023, the Versa will once again come standard with Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 system. The driver-assist suite bundles automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, reverse automatic braking and automatic high-beam assist. A blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are unavailable on the S but return as standard features on the SV and SR. Adaptive cruise control, previously optional on the SR, is now a standard feature on the top trim.\n\nFamiliar Powertrain Returns\n\nShoppers will have a hard time distinguishing between the 2022 and 2023 Versa under the hood. The sedan’s familiar powertrain returns with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 122 horsepower and can be paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission or five-speed manual (offered in the S only). While the S is one of the few remaining vehicles offered with a standard manual, upgrading to the CVT provides a fuel-efficiency advantage of an EPA-rated 35 mpg combined; the manual gets only 30 mpg combined.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n2023 Nissan Versa | Manufacturer image\n\nThe refreshed 2023 Versa will arrive before the end of 2022, with pricing announced closer to its arrival. The Versa currently is Nissan’s smallest sedan and lands among the most affordable cars available, with the 2022 Versa S starting at $16,675 with a manual transmission and $18,345 with the CVT (all prices include destination charge); the SV at $19,485; and the SR at $20,085.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nThe 2022 Nissan Altima Could Be Better; Here’s How\n2023 Nissan Leaf Gets Minor Updates, Simplified Lineup\n2023 Nissan Maxima Enters Final Year Starting at $39,235\nResearch the Nissan Versa\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Nissan Versa is budget-grade transportation to be sure, but it delivers a better all-around driving experience — and a higher level of standard and available features — than you might expect given its bargain-basement pricing.\n\nVersus the competition: Almost all other automakers have discontinued their traditional subcompact cars in recent years; the Mitsubishi Mirage is the Versa’s only remaining direct rival. Subcompact, front-drive-only SUVs like the Chevrolet Trax, Hyundai Venue and Nissan’s own Kicks, however, are similarly penny-pinching competitors.\n\nRelated: Here Are the 10 Cheapest New Cars You Can Buy Right Now\n\nAre you a cheapskate? A tightwad? Do you want the peace of mind of owning a brand-new vehicle over a used car, but insist on paying as little as possible for that warranty protection and new-car smell? Well, I have bad news for you: The cheapest new-vehicle category — the subcompact car class — has shrunk like crazy in recent years, almost to the point of extinction. The 2019 model year included 11 entries in the segment, but in the ensuing five years, the Chevrolet Sonic, Chevrolet Spark, Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, Toyota Prius c, and Toyota Yaris hatchback and Yaris Sedan have all said sayonara. The lowly Mitsubishi Mirage hatchback and Mirage G4 sedan — and the not-so-lowly Nissan Versa sedan — are all that remain.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nAs Cheap as It Gets\n\nThe Versa’s starting price of $17,530 (all prices include destination) makes it the cheapest new car on the market, narrowly undercutting the Mitsubishi Mirage hatchback’s starting price of $18,110 with required options. (Note that the Versa’s rock-bottom price is with its standard five-speed manual transmission, while the Mirage comes standard with an automatic.) Selecting the Versa’s optional continuously variable automatic transmission makes it a bit more expensive than the cheapest Mirage, but no matter the trim level or transmission, the Versa is much more pleasant to drive and ride in than the painfully slow, altogether unrefined Mirage.\n\nEven in its top SR trim, the Versa starts at $21,540, which is roughly the same as base trims of the next-cheapest vehicles on the market. That list includes compact cars like the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte and Toyota Corolla, as well as subcompact SUVs that come only with front-wheel drive, including the Chevrolet Trax, Hyundai Venue and Nissan’s own Kicks. But those entry-level models don’t have the same feature content as a Versa SR, which comes standard with more stuff than you might expect.\n\nThe current-generation Versa debuted for the 2020 model year (gaining flashier styling than the dowdy second-gen model it replaced), and it sees no changes of note for 2024 after a mild freshening for 2023. Chief among last year’s updates were a redesigned, slightly more aggressive-looking grille, along with racier-looking alloy wheels for the SR trim and the welcome addition of more available features, including a wireless charging pad and an 8-inch touchscreen in place of the standard 7-inch screen.\n\nWhat You Do and Don’t Get for the Money\n\nThe base Versa S is very basic, but it’s not 100% bare bones. It has power windows and locks, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, three USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity. It also gets automatic high-beam headlights, lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking as standard equipment. Stepping up to the mid-line SV trim adds a wireless charging pad, heated side mirrors, push-button start, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nThe SR adds keyless access, adaptive cruise control, remote engine start, LED headlights, heated front seats, automatic climate control, a six-speaker audio system and the aforementioned 8-inch touchscreen, along with some interior and exterior cosmetic touches. Our Versa test car was an SR with a few extra-cost options, including Scarlet Ember Tintcoat paint ($395), illuminated door-sill kick plates ($216), carpeted floormats ($175) and a frameless auto-dimming rearview mirror with HomeLink ($282). They pushed its as-tested price to $22,608.\n\nThat’s a very generous level of equipment for the money, but there are still several features that aren’t on the menu. If you want wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity, leather (or even faux leather) upholstery, a heated steering wheel, a moonroof, a 360-degree camera system or a flip-down center armrest in the backseat, you’re out of luck.\n\nWeak-Kneed and Noisy (Sometimes)\n\nThe Versa’s biggest shortcomings are power and engine noise. Its 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine easily outclasses the Mirage’s 78-hp, 1.2-liter three-cylinder, but that’s not saying much. The Versa is decently peppy and responsive in city driving, but it runs out of steam quickly on the highway. Summoning adequate passing power usually requires flooring the gas pedal, which creates as much racket from the engine as it does acceleration. The CVT does engine noise and throttle response no favors; the transmission has a “rubber-band” feel, with a noticeable buildup in engine revs before acceleration comes on in earnest.\n\nThe Versa’s chassis also makes some pronounced thumping noises over bumps and extra-rough pavement, which can also induce some jittery reverberations, but overall, the Versa rides comfortably for a subcompact car; its suspension is reasonably adept at absorbing most everyday bumps and ruts. When the engine isn’t working hard to accelerate, its noise level drops and the Versa is respectably quiet, even in highway driving. Both road noise and tire roar are quelled quite well.\n\nSubcompact cars are especially easy to maneuver and park in tight spaces, and so it is with the Versa. It also feels decently lively in corners by virtue of its small size, but it’s not a particularly polished handler. In addition to the aforementioned reverberations, the steering doesn’t feel as connected or responsive as, say, any Honda or Mazda small car.\n\nCheap, Cheerful Cabin\n\nThe Versa’s interior is obviously built to a price, but it’s perfectly pleasant — even interesting — for the money. The dashboard design has some sporty personality, and accents like simulated-leather trim inserts, orange contrast stitching, satin-silver-finish bits, and even some faux carbon-fiber texturing on the door panels help dress up the hard-plastic parts.\n\nThe seats benefit from some contrasting colors and detailing, but the upholstery itself is low-buck fabric. I found the front-seat cushions to be a bit too spongy for the best support (and I wonder if that “airy” cushioning foam might deteriorate over time), but a fellow editor found both the front and rear seats a little too firm for his tastes. He also complained that the hard-plastic center console rubbed below his knee when driving, which is likely to be a big issue during longer trips.\n\nSpeaking of the center console, its dual cupholders are a little too small to handle extra-large beverages, but the storage bin is decently deep and spacious, and its padded armrest lid is comfortably cushioned. There’s enough space in the front seats for my 6-foot-6 frame, with adequate headroom and legroom, but the backseat isn’t as good. It’s too cramped for me to sit comfortably, and a 6-foot-1 editor also had to slouch a bit due to the limited headroom, though he was fine in terms of legroom and shoulder room. Materials quality falls off a bit more in the backseat, and as previously mentioned, there’s no center armrest or cupholders. Passengers will have to make do with the bottleholders in the door-panel pockets.\n\nThough the Versa’s small-items storage is only so-so, its trunk is generously sized: SV and SR trims boast 15 cubic feet of cargo volume, according to Nissan’s measurements. That’s close to the factory measurements of some mid-size sedans, including the Toyota Camry and Nissan’s own Altima. The rear seatbacks fold down to expand cargo capacity, but they don’t fold flat with the cargo floor: There’s a 4- or 5-inch step that makes it difficult to slide oversized items forward.\n\nSimple Controls\n\nThe Versa’s control layout is simple and straightforward, with easy-to-use physical buttons and knobs. In SV and SR trims, a digital display takes up about two-thirds of the gauge cluster, augmenting an analog speedometer. Drivers can toggle through a variety of helpful readouts on the configurable screen, including an analog-style virtual tachometer, driver-assist feature status, a Bluetooth connected device display, a tire-pressure-monitor display, and both instantaneous and average fuel economy.\n\nWe didn’t do a full, measured fuel-economy test in the Versa, but the dashboard readout showed average fuel economy of 30.6 mpg after about 230 miles of mostly city driving. That’s not outstanding for a subcompact — and it’s a bit shy of the automatic-transmission Versa’s EPA rating of 32/40/35 mpg city/highway/combined — but it’s respectable for a non-hybrid vehicle. And, of course, the expense of a hybrid powertrain would significantly raise the Versa’s sticker price.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Nissan Versa: Budget-Friendly Sedan Starts at $17,225\nSub-$30,000 New Cars Are So Hot Right Now: Report\n2024 Chevrolet Trax Quick Spin: Fully Loaded and Only $26,000?!\nResearch the 2024 Nissan Versa\nShop for a 2024 Nissan Versa\nLast of the True Penny-Pinchers?\n\nConsidering the extreme attrition the subcompact car category has experienced in recent years, it’s conceivable that the Versa and Mirage might have enjoyed an uptick in sales, given they now have the class all to themselves. Nope: Versa sales have trended downward over the past decade, and Mirage sales — which were never robust — have dropped significantly in the past couple years. Both cars are reportedly slated to be discontinued after the 2025 model year. I don’t think anyone will mourn the Mirage’s demise, but as a person who turns his knuckles white attempting to squeeze every possible glob of toothpaste out of a nearly empty tube, I, for one, will be a little sad to see the Versa go away.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Nissan Versa?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive, five-seat Versa is Nissan’s entry-level subcompact sedan. It’s powered by a 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission. Three trim levels are available — S, SV and SR — and the Versa competes with the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Chevrolet Spark. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Nissan Versa? \n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Nissan Versa Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth streaming audio\nFront and rear automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAutomatic air conditioning\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated front seats\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Nissan Versa?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a subcompact sedan, the Nissan Versa is a fuel-efficient and competitively priced choice. Other virtues include an extensive assortment of standard and available active-safety features, along with upscale options like heated front seats and automatic air conditioning. The four-cylinder engine is weak, however, and the ride can get choppy on rough roads.",

Its four-cylinder engine is weak, however, and its ride can get choppy on rough roads.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nNissan redesigned its Versa sedan last year. While the car’s styling isn’t particularly memorable, buyers will appreciate the roomy interior, low starting price and fuel efficiency. The Versa is one of the most affordable cars in the U.S. Competitors include the Hyundai Accent, Toyota Yaris and Ford Fiesta.\n\nNissan still sells a Versa hatchback — which is considerably more expensive than the sedan — that’s based on the previous-generation car.\n\nNew for 2013\nVersa sedans with the continuously variable automatic transmission are now rated at an EPA-estimated 40 mpg on the highway, and the different trim levels come with more features. The base S adds a trunk light and the SV gains cloth door trim, chrome door handles and a driver’s-seat armrest. The top-level SL adds Nissan’s Intelligent Key, remote trunk release and sun-visor extenders. The Versa hatchback continues to be sold as a 2012 model through the end of the 2012 calendar year.\nExterior\nWe’ve seen striking designs trickle down to economy cars lately with the introduction of the Ford Fiesta and redesigned Hyundai Accent, but Nissan seems to have de-emphasized design with the Versa sedan, which has a largely forgettable exterior. The design does, however, let the Versa slip smoothly through the air, as the sedan has a 0.31 drag coefficient. Exterior features include:\n\n\n15-inch steel wheels with covers standard; 16-inch wheels available\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable rear spoiler\n\nInterior\nThe Versa sedan’s cabin quality is disappointing because its basic materials and controls are a step backward from the prior-generation car. However, the Versa remains a space-efficient car and can comfortably accommodate adult passengers in the front and rear seats at the same time. Interior features include:\n\n\nAir conditioning\nCD stereo\nAvailable power windows, mirrors and cruise control\nAvailable 60/40-split folding backseat\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Versa sedan has a 109-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine while the hatchback uses a 122-hp, 1.8-liter four-cylinder. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSedan can have a five-speed manual, four-speed automatic or a continuously variable automatic transmission\nHatchback can have a six-speed manual, four-speed automatic or a CVT\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\nAvailable backup camera",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Nissan Versa?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive, five-seat Versa is Nissan’s entry-level subcompact sedan. It’s powered by a 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic transmission. Three trim levels are available — S, SV and SR — and the Versa competes with the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Chevrolet Spark. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Nissan Versa? \n\nRedesigned last year, there are no significant changes for 2021. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Nissan Versa Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRemote keyless entry with push-button start\nCruise control\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth streaming audio\nFront and rear automatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAutomatic air conditioning\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated front seats\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2021 Nissan Versa?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a subcompact sedan, the Nissan Versa is a fuel-efficient and competitively priced choice in a dwindling class. Other virtues include an extensive assortment of standard and available active safety features, along with upscale options like heated front seats and automatic air conditioning. The four-cylinder engine is weak, however, and the ride can get choppy on rough roads.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2020 Nissan Versa is no longer the least expensive new car in America, but it’s a much better car that’s still cheaper than most.\n\nVersus the competition: The Versa delivers value at every trim level versus rival subcompact sedans and similarly priced used cars. Its stiffest competition, though, might be a case of sibling rivalry: Nissan’s Kicks small hatchback isn’t a lot more money.\n\nThe fully redesigned 2020 Nissan Versa is cuter, techier and a bit more powerful than the outgoing model — and also more expensive. Its previous claim to fame was the lowest price tag in the U.S. for a new car — but it looked and drove like it. Nissan says the Versa remains an important entry product even as some automakers have abandoned small cars, but it’s shifted its focus to offering more value in a car you might actually want.\n\nRelated: Nissan Versa Sedan Returns for 2020 to Fight Entry-Level Exodus\n\nWith that in mind, Nissan has given the Versa desirable, even unexpected, features and safety tech that gets sweeter as you climb from the base S through the SV and new SR trim levels. And though up from 2019’s used-car-like $13,355 to $15,625, the 2020 base price is still at the lower end of the class (all prices include an $895 destination charge). The base price does reflect a manual transmission, though, and realistically most buyers will want the pricey $1,670 automatic, making the ante $17,295. The SV and SR have the automatic standard.\n\nThe Versa’s competition includes subcompact survivors such as the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Toyota Yaris. While the Rio and Yaris can be had as either a sedan or hatchback, the Versa Note hatchback has been retired; Nissan’s spunky SUV-like Kicks subcompact hatch is the de facto replacement.\n\nTo see if the Versa delivers on the promise of better value, I drove both a base Versa S and a top-of-the-line SR trim level (just under $20,000). The short answer is that while there is a price bump, it’s also a much better car.\n\nScaled-Down Altima Looks\n\nThe formerly lumpy Versa sedan now wears a scaled-down version of the new Altima’s lines, with a deep V-Motion grille stretching into sleeker headlight assemblies that include boomerang-shaped daytime running lights. The sloped roofline extends into a short trunk lid with an upturned lip and boomerang-shaped taillights. There’s a hint of a “floating roof,” with a back pillar divided by black trim, but the Versa doesn’t offer a contrast-color roof option, nor some of the other color personalization options that give the Kicks a dose of fun. At least the Versa’s paint palette includes some bright colors, including Electric Blue Metallic and Monarch Orange Metallic.\n\nCompact-Car Roomy\n\nThe 2020 Versa is slightly bigger than the last generation — 1.6 inches longer and 1.8 inches wider — and continues to offer almost compact-car passenger room, including a backseat that fits actual adults. I had plenty of legroom in back to sit behind my 6-foot-2 self in front, though that sleeker roofline is 2.3 inches lower than the 2019’s, which left my head brushing the rear ceiling. Trunk space is better than in most compact cars, at 14.7 cubic feet (the 2020 Toyota Corolla has 13.1 cubic feet), and expands via a standard 60/40-split, folding backseat.\n\nThe front and rear seats were comfortable, though both cars I drove needed more padding in the seat cushions. The front passenger can enjoy stretch-out-your-legs space thanks to the seat’s extended travel, which almost reaches the rear-seat cushion. The cloth upholstery was more interesting on the SV and SR, with contrasting colors and stitching, but the base cloth had a decent feel (if a duller look).\n\nKicks Style Inside and More Tech\n\nIf you like the interior design of the Kicks, you’ll like the new Versa’s cabin layout. It sheds the Soviet drabness of the old car, picking up the Kicks’ sculpted and upswept dashboard design, with a 7-inch center touchscreen on all models and better-looking door panels. SV and SR trim levels also have a 7-inch configurable screen in the instrument cluster — an unusually upscale touch for a subcompact — as well as a swath of soft-touch stitched vinyl across the face of the dash. The center screen is flanked by volume and tuning knobs, along with shortcut buttons that have a quality feel. The SV and SR add NissanConnect with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, satellite radio capability, steering-wheel controls and voice recognition.\n\nThe Versa’s features-per-dollar ratio peaks in the new SR, which has standard LED headlights and daytime running lights, remote engine start, automatic climate control and leather wrapping on the D-shaped steering wheel and shift knob. Heated front seats are optional. But even the base model gets Bluetooth streaming, remote keyless entry and push-button start. All trim levels have USB and 12-volt ports under the dash in a generous phone cubby, plus two more USB ports at the rear of the center “console,” which is really a hard plastic tray with a couple shallow cubbies and cupholders, but no covered bin to supplement the stingy interior storage. You can add a small covered storage space to any trim level with a $300 armrest.\n\nAlong with the console, other cost-cutting is apparent inside, even if the many features and tech do offset it. As expected in this price range, there’s plenty of hard plastic, particularly in the S. The driver’s seat gets a fold-down inboard armrest only on the SV and above. The front passenger goes without both an armrest and seat-height adjustment.\n\nDriving Dynamics Improved, But Not a Lot of Kicks\n\nWhile no one expects a lot of driving fun in a budget subcompact, I was looking for a bit more than I got in the Versa. My expectations came because it now shares a platform with the Kicks, whose nimbleness is among the reasons it’s a favorite city car of mine.\n\nThe new Versa does, however, deliver a combination of acceptable handling and decent ride for the price. Cornering brings minimal lean, and the chassis isn’t busy or floaty on the highway. Pushing it brings body roll and more tire-scrubbing understeer, but why would you push it? The SR’s 17-inch alloy wheels and wider rubber improve agility noticeably over the S, with its 15-inch steel wheels and skinnier tires. Steering is light and numb, but crisp, while braking feel is a little soft, but predictable (there are discs in front, drums in back). Meanwhile, the Versa delivers a comfortable ride. There’s some choppiness when the pavement gets rough, but it was never harsh.\n\nMore comparable to the Kicks is the Versa’s low dose of go power. The 2020 Versa uses the same 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine as the Kicks, which puts out a mere 114 pounds-feet of torque. That does represent a much-needed pinch more zip, however, than the 2019 Versa’s woeful 109 hp and 107 pounds-feet. The engine is paired with a five-speed manual (in the base S only) or a continuously variable automatic that’s reasonably well behaved in terms of CVT drone and rubber-band feel. The modest powertrain is enough for the light sedan (the Versa weighs about 2,600 to 2,700 pounds, depending on trim level) to feel peppy in city traffic. Floor it, however, and it bogs for a couple of beats off the line before gathering momentum with more buzzy noise than urgency.\n\nAs important — maybe even more important for budget-car buyers — is fuel economy, and the 2020 Versa is EPA-rated a respectable 32/40/35 mpg city/highway/combined with the CVT. That’s a mile better in each category than the 2019. You’ll pay for DIY shifting: The manual comes in much lower, as it did for 2019, at just 30 mpg combined. By comparison, the automatic Yaris, Rio and Accent deliver up to 35, 32 and 32 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nBig Safety Tech Bundle for Small Spenders\n\nThey aren’t the sexiest features, but standard safety tech is essential to good value, and the Versa delivers. Even the base S includes front automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection up to 37 mph, reverse automatic braking up to 9 mph (unusual for this class), a lane departure warning system, and automatic headlights and high beams. The SV and SR add blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a driver alertness warning, adaptive grid lines for the backup camera and a rear door alert that signals if you opened the door at the start of a drive but don’t check the backseat again after you park.\n\nA $300 option for the SR adds adaptive cruise control — another unusual upscale feature for a  subcompact. You couldn’t find any of this safety and assistance tech on the old Versa, and the Yaris, Rio and Accent offer fewer such features, or restrict them to fewer trim levels. You can compare their features here.\n\nLow-tech but also a key safety feature is the Versa’s visibility, thanks to a beltline that dips low and side mirrors that have been relocated lower on the door. The sight lines over the shoulder and to the rear are also good.\n\nThis car could appeal to young families, and it got an excellent report card in Cars.com’s 2020 Nissan Versa Car Seat Check for fit and ease of use for our four types of child-safety seats. It scored nearly all A’s — unusually high for a subcompact sedan — with the lone B coming on the booster seat check; its floppy rear seat belt buckles could be hard for a kid to use alone.\n\nThe Versa had not been crash-tested as of this writing. When available, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety scores for 2020 will be found here.\n\n2020 Nissan Versa | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\nOverdelivering on Value\n\nWhile light on driving fun, the 2020 Versa hits the right notes on value for a wide range of shoppers. The footprint suits city streets and parking. The styling, interior design and tech now require no apologies. And the combination of safety and practical space could also attract small families or make you feel OK putting a young driver in it.\n\nWhile it’s no longer America’s cheapest new sedan, the 2020 Versa manages to overdeliver on space and features for a starting base price that still slightly undercuts its rivals, the Accent and Yaris, though Kia has a cheaper 2019 Rio (with automatic). Its modern safety equipment and media tech also raise its value versus an older used car going for a similar price.\n\nBeyond the base model, the price tag is still a starter-car low $18,535 for the SV, which adds more safety technology and a lot of desirable features, including padded dashboard trim, nicer seats, an upgraded media system and 16-inch alloy wheels. Even an SR with heated front seats and adaptive cruise control is still a hair under $20,000.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Nissan has a new name on the block: Versa. I’m always intrigued by the names manufacturers select for their vehicles: LeSabre, Corolla, Passat. What do they mean? I’m guessing “Versa” is meant to imply “versatile,” but often my experience driving this little offering from Nissan more closely resembled “versus.” Don’t get me wrong; I didn’t fight this car. In fact, it’s quite friendly and zippy. Rather, living in a town where most people’s vehicle choices come down to SUV versus truck, more often than not the Versa had to fight her way through traffic. Believe it or not, she did it with grace.\n\nSo maybe Nissan means Versa to sound poetic and lyrical, like “verse.” While I wouldn’t call it lyrical, the 2007 Nissan Versa hatchback certainly was smooth and easy to drive, and I truly enjoyed its easygoing nature. It took corners without feeling like it would topple over. I liked the tight steering and solid braking, and though it doesn’t have a huge engine, I never felt as though it lacked power. I won’t be taking the Versa up any mountain passes at the speed of light, but around town, this car is pretty great.\n\nWhat else makes the Versa great? The kids can get in and out completely on their own – no doorjamb head-bonking here. My son can fasten his seat belt himself most of the time, and when he can’t, I can help him from the driver’s seat (though not while driving, of course). Yet at the same time, I don’t feel crammed. There’s some kind of weird magic in the Versa’s interior that makes this possible. How can my husband both be comfortable and hand out snacks to the kids in the back at the same time? It’s so weird!\n\nThen there’s the cargo space in the back; it seems tiny, but it can handle an umbrella stroller and a full grocery trip, though a double stroller doesn’t fit. No one should buy the Versa to accommodate trips to Sam’s Club or Home Depot, but what the Versa can handle is a pleasant surprise. Child safety seats are easy to install without any hiccups. Maybe “Versa” means “magic” in Japanese.\n\nThere are a few things, though, that aren’t so magical. Some creature comforts are missing, most notably a console between the front seats and a vanity mirror. I know, that last one probably made you groan. It’s true; on any given day I don’t deserve a vanity mirror either because I haven’t put forth any effort to impress the other folks in the carpool lane, but is it really too much to ask to be able to verify my lip gloss is on straight? Also, the Versa’s doors close quickly and the seats butt right up to the door. My kids narrowly escaped getting their fingers caught more than a few times as they tried to close the doors on their own. I instantly invented a show-me-your-hands-when-the doors-are-closing game.\n\nI enjoy a car I don’t have to work against, figure out or demystify, and with the Versa I can just get in, drive and be happy. Oh, and the driver’s-side window has power up and down operation. Yes!\n\nFundamentally, I see the Versa as a great little commuter car to get the kids to school or day care and home again. In the meantime, it can handle one or two small errands, all while getting great gas mileage. It also dodges and weaves between those bigger vehicles with ease. Perhaps “versatile” really is the best definition for the Versa.\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Versa and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLatch Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Some",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nNissan has updated its Versa subcompact sedan, addressing some of the issues that the press and public have had with the roomy entry-level car while holding the line on its low price.\nExteriorThis is just a mild refresh of the Versa, with changes fairly limited. A new front grille, headlights, fog-light surrounds and wheels comprise the external changes, but the updates don’t look especially new, just different. Larger headlights give the Versa a wide-eyed appearance meant to align the car with the rest of Nissan’s lineup.\nInteriorInterior updates include a new center stack that looks better than the Versa’s outgoing plastic version, a nicer steering wheel and standard Bluetooth connectivity. As with most new small cars today, you can option a 2015 Versa with all manner of electronic goodies, including a 5.8-inch touch-screen with app capability, voice commands and navigation. The Versa’s surprisingly roomy interior remains a strong point, with one of the biggest passenger cabins in its class and a copious 14.9 cubic feet of trunk space.\nUnder The HoodThe powertrain is unchanged. It remains a 109-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that’s mated to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission in the base S trim or a standard continuously variable automatic transmission in the S Plus, SL and SV trims. Fuel economy is also unchanged for the Versa.",

      "expert_review": "Even with its redesign for the 2012 model year, the Nissan Versa sedan remains a utilitarian subcompact that gets the job done but won’t blow away owners with its extras.\n\nThink of the Versa as the flathead screwdriver in your toolbox. This sedan gets from Point A to Point B really well. Like the screwdriver, the Versa is rather bare-bones. There’s not a lot to get excited about in terms of features or design cues.\n\nInstead, get excited about its functionality and price. A Versa bragging point is its low starting price. The 2012 sedan has a starting MSRP of $10,990 and is the most affordable new car on the market. My Versa SL sedan cost $15,560. The Versa is also available as a hatchback.\n\nThe Versa has a four-cylinder engine that’s paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The CVT is loud and likes to hang out at much higher rpms than I’d like. There’s a lot of noise from the CVT as well as wind and road noise that creeps into the cabin.\n\nWhile I test-drove the top-of-the-line Versa SL, the base model was recently put to the test against some of its competitors in the $16,000 Subcompact Shootout. Find out how it compares here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nFrom the bug-eyed Juke and Leaf to the squared-off Quest minivan, Nissan is known for the stand-out designs in its lineup. The Versa didn’t receive any looks as extreme as its sibling in its redesign; it just got a few tweaks for 2012. The upshot is it won’t stick out like a sore thumb anywhere.\n\nThe Versa’s other upshot is it’s easy to use; like the screwdriver, there’s no mystery. All of my family members, including my school-aged kids, found the doors easy to open and close. The step-in height is low enough for young kids to manage on their own. The trunk can fit a decent grocery run, and the 60/40-split rear seats fold in the event of cargo overflow.\n\nThe SL has a 109-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and a CVT. It uses regular gas and gets an EPA-estimated 30/38 mpg city/highway. A five-speed manual transmission is also available. My test car didn’t have snow tires and the Versa was so lightweight that when my Colorado town got a huge snowfall, I couldn’t get the Versa out of my driveway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Versa’s interior is as much a showcase for practicality as its exterior. My SL-trim Versa had a few niceties such as Bluetooth connectivity, USB connectivity and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls. What it didn’t have was a center console or an armrest. I kept trying to park my arm where the armrest should have been, though, much like I tried to put my foot on a clutch only to remember I was driving an automatic.\n\nThe front seats are narrow and fit me nicely. My pre-production test car had black upholstery that looked and felt just fine. There were two cupholders in front of the gearshift and two more between the front seats for backseat passengers.\n\nI liked how everything in the Versa was easy to reach and adjust. The stereo and climate controls didn’t require any sort of degree in decoding or computer systems to use. Simple, clearly marked buttons and dials control those systems, and I respect that. A navigation system is optional.\n\nThe kids had good legroom in the backseat, and even my husband was mostly comfortable when the whole family was loaded in the Versa.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Versa sedan has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A car must receive the top score of Good in IIHS front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests to receive the safety award. The 2012 Versa sedan has received a four-star safety rating (out of five) overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received three stars in the frontal crash test and four starts in both side and rollover crash tests.\n\nThanks to its roomy backseat, the Versa is great for child-safety seats. Rear-facing convertible and infant-safety seats fit well in it. However, the Versa’s two sets of Latch anchors in the outboard seats were difficult to use because the seat cushions are tight against them. Find out how the Versa performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2012 Versa comes with standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. The Versa’s brakes have front discs and rear drums.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Nissan Versa here.",

      "expert_review": "Small cars are in, for sure.\n\nToday’s high gasoline prices have made sure of that.\n\nBut small and fuel-efficient doesn’t have to mean cramped or boring.\n\nConsider the case of the Nissan Versa, the new subcompact that plays in the same market segment with the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris and Chevrolet Aveo.\n\nThis car stands out from that pack in that it’s actually a compact at the price of one of those subcompacts, thanks to Nissan’s desire to bring a vehicle to the United States last year to compete with those other cars.\n\nNissan initially introduced the Versa only in hatchback form, and that car is quite a value in itself.\n\nBut since then, the automaker has rolled out a sedan version, which we tested for this report.\n\nSedan or hatchback, this is a great car for the money, and one that won’t make frugal buyers feel that they are giving up comfort and style for the sake of economy.\n\nNissan calls the Versa the cure for “autoclaustrophobia.”\n\nWhen the hatchback was introduced last year, Nissan promoted the car with TV ads that followed the format of prescription-drug commercials, showing “autoclaustrophobia” sufferers stuffed inside sardine-can cars, then cured of the disease by getting into the Versa.\n\nThe ads were designed to help the Versa stand out in an all-of-a-sudden crowded field of affordable, fuel-efficient new subcompacts. It arrived at the same time that Honda and Toyota were bringing the Fit and Versa to market.\n\nThose two and the Versa joined several other economy subcompacts already on sale, including the South Korea-built Aveo, as well as the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Suzuki Reno.\n\nThe ads did a good job of making this important point: The Versa is not one of those cramped econoboxes that automakers intend for people whose transportation budgets are challenged.\n\nThe Versa, in fact, is not a new car for Nissan, it’s just new to the U.S. market.\n\nBut get this: In Japan, it’s sold as a luxury car, way above the entry-level position it holds in Nissan’s North American lineup.\n\nIn its first year on the market, Versa accounted for more than 60,000 sales, making it a rousing success in such a crowded market.\n\nFor 2008, Versa is available sedan and hatchback forms, in two trim levels: S and SL.\n\nSedans begin at $12,630 (plus $625 freight) and hatchbacks at $12,730.\n\nOur tester, though, was the SL sedan with continuously variable automatic transmission (base price $15,630), with the new optional Sport package ($700), as well as a sunroof ($600) and convenience package ($650). That gave it a total price of $17,855, including freight and options.\n\nThe nice thing, though, is that you don’t have to spend that much money to have a nicely equipped Versa. Even the base model comes with lots of standard amenities.\n\nBesides the great price and roomy interior, the car has EPA ratings of 27 miles per gallon city/33 highway with the continuously variable transmission, 26/31 with the base six-speed manual gearbox, and 24/32 with the traditional four-speed automatic transmission offered with the base S model.\n\nWith those ratings, this vehicle is not far behind the fuel economy of some of the popular gasoline-electric hybrids, such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Prius. Yet it’s about half the price. The savings are realized not only at the gas pumps but also in the monthly car-payment check.\n\nAll Versas are powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that turns out 122 horsepower and 127 foot-pounds of torque – giving the car a lot of pep thanks to its light weight.\n\nAnd even its power sets it out from the rest of the pack. The Yaris, for instance, has 106 horsepower, and the Fit 108 horsepower. Both of those vehicles have similar starting prices and EPA ratings. The Versa has more power than its other competitors as well.\n\nThe Versa seems to be a lot more expensive than it is, and consumers will forget that they’re driving a car whose primary goal is to save them money.\n\nAmong Nissan’s U.S. offerings, the Versa comes in just under the Sentra sedan in size and price. The Sentra, which long has been Nissan’s entry-level vehicle in the U.S. market, was redesigned for 2007, making it larger and more upscale.\n\nThat left a void in the under-$14,000 segment, which the Versa fills nicely.\n\nSubcompacts are one of the fastest-growing vehicle segments, thanks in part to the rising gasoline prices. More than 1.9 million vehicles in this class were sold in the U.S. market during the last full calendar year (2006), and are pace to beat that for 2007. That was 11 percent of total U.S. new-vehicle sales.\n\nThe Versa leads the class in interior space and comfort, with upscale quality and amenities not found in the competitors. Even the back seat is comfortable — full-size adults can sit three-across, and there is ample legroom.\n\nThe sedan is nearly seven inches longer than the hatchback, but the height and width are the same, and both have a 102.4-inch wheelbase.\n\nIn the hatchback, there is room for lots of cargo even with the back seat in place; fold it down, and the space increases dramatically. The sedan has a roomy trunk that can be expanded by folding down the rear seat as well.\n\nAlso in keeping with a new Nissan strategy, the car has a well-thought-out interior design, with high-quality components that include soft-touch materials that usually are found only in premium cars, the company said.\n\nThat includes well-padded seats and double stitching for the upholstery. Nissan designers used the flagship Maxima sedan as their benchmark for the Versa’s interior.\n\nStandard features on even base models include air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, 15-inch steel wheels, power outside mirrors, rear-window defrost and a 120-watt single-disc AM/FM/compact-disc audio system.\n\nAmong available options are Sirius or XM satellite radio (buyer’s option), antilock brakes (available on all trim levels), and upgraded audio systems, including a 180-watt system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer.\n\nThe 180-watt system is standard on the SL models, along with cruise control, 15-inch alloy wheels, and power windows and door locks with remote. A further upgrade adds a Rockford Fosgate subwoofer and premium Clarion speakers.\n\nIncluded on all models are front seat-mounted side air bags, along with overhead side-curtain air bags for front and rear passengers.\n\nThe Versa was developed jointly by Nissan and its French partner Renault, and also is used on a Renault model sold in Europe and other markets. The Versa is built in Nissan’s factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and is sold in Mexico and other countries as the Tiida.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995. Contact him at chambers@star-telegram.com. ————————\n\n2008 Nissan Versa\n\nThe package: Subcompact, four- or five-door, four-cylinder, front-drive, five-passenger sedan or hatchback.\n\nHighlights: All new last year, this is now Nissan’s entry-level car, just under the compact Sentra in the company’s lineup.

      "expert_review": "For every Bentley SuperSport Coupe I get to drive, there are three much less expensive models that also need a few laps around town.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean I’m slumming it. Every car needs a context. And although one SportsCoupe equals more than 16 Nissan Versa Hatchbacks SL’s price wise, the cars do share a few similar attributes.\n\nSure, the SportsCoupe has the power of five Versas and boasts an interior package that likely costs more than a couple of the Japanese subcompact. But in the Versa I never had to worry about standing along the highway or even the possibility of a piece of gravel nicking the windshield, which, in a Bentley, would no doubt leave a repair bill with too many zeroes.\n\nAfter a trip to Chelsea and a week of running about town, the Versa never seemed to cause a worry, and for many drivers, that’s as good as it gets.\n\nIt’s comfortable, tough and one of the better vehicles to harness the savings of a CVT — that belt and pulley transmission I find little pleasure in — without hampering performance.\n\nNoise, bounce expected\n\nNow, the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine may not create gut-wrenching power, but it does provide plenty of pep. The 122-horsepower engine provides a little more giddy-up than the standard 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, which comes with the base model sedan.\n\nEven jumping on the highway, the Versa seemed to have more than enough power to merge into traffic with big rigs and SUVs. The CVT, while slightly annoying with its lack of shift points, never wound out to high revs like some others. The pickup was clean and only during heavy-footed driving did I even remember it was a CVT.\n\nThe ride is a little bouncy and noticeably noisy, but for a subcompact it’s pretty good. That’s where a little context is needed. A $16,000 car is never going to provide the near-silent transportation a $50,000 one will, much less something with the word Bentley as a moniker. That’s engineering and economics. You can only do some much with so little. During these tough times, lots of bosses may say we have to do more with less, but you can only do so much with so little.\n\nOn the highway, the Versa Hatchback SL seemed to cruise well enough that I had to use the steering wheel mounted cruise control buttons to make sure the Ann Arbor police didn’t end up with a copy of my license for some alleged violation.\n\nThe hatchback model has a wide profile — it kind of looks like a little chunk of cheese — so when the big winds from a storm blew in, the car wanted to shudder some. It would also shake when big semi trucks blew by. It is a small, light vehicle (2,758 pounds); that’s physics.\n\nPlenty of space\n\nBut that’s also why the Versa hatchback feels so spacious inside.\n\nWith 41.4 inches of front leg room, the Versa had plenty of legroom and the seat, while manually adjusted (peshaw!), was able to move into a comfortable driving position. I even packed three people into the Versa, and no one complained in the 90-minute drive to and fro. (The second row has 38 inches of legroom.) Four people seem the realistic limit, unless the back seat passengers are children. Cramming in five adults would require a wedding license in some states.\n\nFurthermore, the entire interior was very driver friendly. From the easy-to-read instrument cluster to the iPod connectivity that lets you plug in your music player and tuck it away behind a door. (Note: the stiff wire makes it difficult to stuff it in there and the operation controls were confusing to use.)\n\nThere were some cheap plastic trim pieces in the cabin but none of it was offensive or poorly made.\n\nMy test model included the optional premium package, which certainly added some charms. Included in the options was Nissan’s intelligent key, which doesn’t require you to insert the key, but does require you to turn a plastic knob on the steering column. (A push button on the dash would look so much better.)\n\nThe Bluetooth connection for hands-free phone operation works well and includes a button on the steering wheel to answer the phone. (With the USB connector, you can also keep your phone charged while playing music.)\n\nThere’s also the hatchback versatility of the folding second row that can create more than 50 cubic feet of useable space. A subcompact is never going to be known as big hauler, but a small car doesn’t have to be small on space. (This is also why the car allows more road noise, because there’s no trunk to absorb it.)\n\nVersa holds own among rivals\n\nWhile nicely updated, the 2010 Versa is entering its fourth model year for this generation; in the coming years it should undergo an extensive makeover. How that will changes its looks will depend a lot upon how stiff the competition becomes in this group.\n\nFord Motor Co. will launch its all-new subcompact Fiesta this year. A Chevy Aveo with a new look also will roll out soon. Then there are the Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit, perennial front runners in the subcompact segment. There’s no word on Bentley entering the inexpensive and industrial working man and woman’s subcompact market anytime soon. Good thing, because I would have to rethink a lot of things.\n\nFor now, the Versa holds its own against any of the competition on the road today, all the while getting 34 miles per gallon on the highway, which is one of the reasons people hop into these little cars. The Versa, however, lets people enjoy more than just the mileage. They can enjoy the ride, too.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Months before the 2009 Nissan Versa’s arrival at my doorstep, I was eagerly anticipating test driving one of the most affordable cars in the market today. I knew it would lack the frills and jaw-dropping, heart-pounding amenities of more expensive sedans. However, I can appreciate simplicity, so I welcomed the Versa into my driveway.\n\nThis car is basic. It’s a base model, so there’s no radio, no power windows and no mirrors in the visors. There’s not even a center console for interior storage. At first I was fine with the interior’s simplicity. I’ve rarely used the center console as my storage crutch, and the crank windows could provide some much needed upper-body exercise. Heck, the lack of a radio just meant I’d be forced to enjoy the peace and quiet for a change.\n\nWith several long hauls on my schedule during my Versa test week, I was looking forward to monitoring the sedan’s gas mileage, ride and performance at higher speeds. After trip No. 1, I was just warming up. The Versa is much peppier than I’d expected, and it practically sipped gas. My test car had a five-speed manual transmission. When I was driving at 70-75 mph, the engine was all revved up and begging for another gear.\n\nBy trip No. 2, my back was sore and I was annoyed by the lack of National Public Radio or any radio. At one point, I called my husband to ask him if I could listen to his radio via the cell phone. “I can’t take the quiet anymore. Can you just put your phone in the cupholder, so I can listen to your radio? I’m not joking!”\n\nUnfortunately for the Versa, all of that quiet time didn’t offer the perfect canvas for planning my future. Instead it forced me to focus on every squeak, rattle and whine the car made. I suggest Nissan keeps the Versa’s price low but find a way to incorporate a good sound system to mask the other sounds this car emits. After all, there is more to achieving value status than just a low price.\n\nBy the end of the week, I’d used three-quarters of a tank of gas and had driven nearly 400 miles; almost 100 percent of these miles were on the highway. I know that those are good numbers, but I’ve driven much larger vehicles (both were clean diesels) that have each achieved 500 miles on one tank.\n\nThe Nissan Versa provides a decent vehicle at a low price. However, a few additions such as a radio and another gear on the manual transmission would push this cutie into the “value” victory lane!\n\nExterior\n\nThe Versa sedan looks really cute, and it’s noticeably larger than many of its competitors. There are no chrome accents or sculpted sheet-metal curves here, but it’s hardly boxy.\n\nThe horizontal lines of the grille turn up slightly at the ends, which reminded me of a baby’s smile. You know the look that could be a slight smile or gas.\n\nBecause the Versa is so low to the ground, my own babies were able to get in and out easily.\n\nI did notice its small size when I had to bend my neck awkwardly as I maneuvered into the car’s door and trunk openings. When I reached into the back of the trunk to fetch a grocery bag, I banged my head on the car as I started to pull my head out. Ouch!\n\nOverall, I’d say the Versa’s exterior is simple, humble, cute and ready to serve.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nGetting into the Versa is like traveling back in time. There’s no key fob and only sparse instrumentation, which displayed information on a need-to-know basis. In truth, it gave me all of the information that I really…uh…needed to know, but nothing more. There’s no radio, no navigation system and certainly, no backup camera. Let’s just say it transported me back to my childhood.\n\nThe Charcoal-colored cloth interior is super-soft to the touch, but it hoards crumbs and random fuzzies as if each spec has some serious monetary value. My second-row residents, the creators of said specs, weren’t pleased with their seating, either. One afternoon as my youngest was trying to doze off on one of our longer trips, he kept waking with a start and whining, “Mommy, these seats are too slippery! I keep falling down!” It was true. He uses a backless booster seat, so his back rests on the car’s seatback. I watched him in the rearview mirror as he kept slipping down like a wet noodle.\n\nI’m going to proclaim that there aren’t any cupholders in the second row. There are two cupholders where the center console would have been, and they were completely out of reach for my kids. I quickly scanned the second-row doors for bins since they often house a secondary beverage-holding device, but there aren’t any. I felt fear. Really.\n\nTo its credit, the Versa does have air conditioning and four prewired speakers for some day down the road when you choose to add your own audio system. The Versa is also very spacious; my boys had a ton of legroom in the backseat. Likewise, I never felt cramped in the front row. Compared to the Versa’s competition – the Chevy Aveo, Toyota Yaris and Hyundai Accent – it has the most passenger volume and trunk space.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nFor such a no-frills car, the Versa scores well in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests. It scored a Good – the highest rating – in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests.\n\nThe Versa comes with front, side-impact and side curtain airbags. It also comes with a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nThe Latch connectors are easy to find. I didn’t have to dig down deep to get to them, which would make installing a child-safety seat easy.\n\nHowever, if you want antilock brakes, you’re going to have to pay – $250 – for the ABS Package, which also adds electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. That’s not an expensive upgrade, but a safety feature as important as antilock brakes should come standard.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: While it’s roomy on the inside, a rear-facing infant-safety seat could be difficult to fit in there.\n\nIn School: There’s plenty of legroom in the back for kids in booster seats.\n\nTeens: If you add antilock brakes to this car it’d make a great first car for a teen.",
