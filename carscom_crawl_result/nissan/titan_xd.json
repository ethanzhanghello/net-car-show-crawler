      "expert_review": "After axing the two-door regular cab and dropping the Cummins diesel from its sort-of-heavy-duty Titan XD for 2020, Nissan is further consolidating the Titan lineup for the 2024 model year. Gone is the base S trim, with the entry point now being the SV. The King Cab, with its slim rear-hinged back doors, is now only available as a four-wheel-drive SV. All XDs are crew cabs, and both the regular Titan and the XD crew cabs are available in SV, Pro-4X and Platinum Reserve trim levels.\n\nRelated: What Are the Best MPG Pickup Trucks?\n\nGoing for the Bronze\n\nNew for 2024 is the Bronze Edition Package, available on SV trucks. It adds bronze-painted 20-inch wheels, a black front bumper and grille surround, and a sport bar in the bed. For $2,980, it strikes us as a good deal — if you’re into that kind of thing.\n\nAll Titans are powered by a 5.6-liter V-8 that makes 400 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque — so long as you feed it premium gas. It’ll run fine on regular, but output and fuel economy may suffer. The only transmission is a nine-speed automatic. The regular Titan is available in rear- or four-wheel drive, but the XD only comes in 4WD.\n\nEvery Titan also includes Nissan Safety Shield 360, which includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitors, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert with rear automatic emergency braking. Adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition and a 360-degree parking camera are available.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Nissan Titan is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,895 for delivery) is as follows:\n\nTitan\n\nSV crew cab RWD: $47,665\nSV crew cab 4WD: $50,855\nSV King Cab 4WD: $51,035\nPro-4X crew cab 4WD: $55,475\nPlatinum Reserve crew cab RWD: $61,335\nPlatinum Reserve crew cab 4WD: $64,645\n\nTitan XD\n\nSV: $53,825\nPro-4X: $59,785\nPlatinum Reserve: $67,735\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Nissan Titan Adds Wireless Apple CarPlay and Midnight Edition, Starts at $41,495\n2020 Nissan Titan Review: No Longer a ‘Yeah, But’ Truck\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\n2020 Nissan Titan XD Review: More Power, More Payload, More Sense\nResearch the Nissan Titan\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Titan has always tried to be a good budget pick for buyers in the hotly contested pickup truck segment. In an era where price increases have become the new normal, Nissan is using the 2023 model year to make some pricing adjustments to the truck; the base S trim rings in at $41,495 (all prices include a $1,795 destination charge), only going up $890 versus last year, with the rest of the lineup also receiving price hikes.\n\nRelated: How Does the 2020 Titan Pro-4X Perform Off-Road?\n\nPricing Changes Soften Blow to the Wallet\n\nThe 2023 Titan largely carries over unchanged from the 2022 model year. Full pricing for the non-XD lineup is as follows:\n\nS King Cab RWD: $41,495 (up $890)\nS crew cab RWD: $43,285 (up $1,410)\nS King Cab 4WD: $44,785 (up $920)\nS crew cab 4WD: $46,475 (up $1,440)\nSV crew cab RWD: $46,795 (up $1,440)\nSV King Cab RWD: $46,875 (up $940)\nSV crew cab 4WD: $49,985 (up $1,470)\nSV King Cab 4WD: $50,165 (up $970)\nPro-4X crew cab 4WD: $54,605 (up $1,610)\nPlatinum Reserve crew cab RWD: $60,465 (up $1,670)\nPlatinum Reserve crew cab 4WD: $63,775 (up $1,700)\n\nThe XD models also see pricing adjustments, with the base XD S starting $960 higher at $49,135 and the other trims following suit. All Titan XDs come standard in crew-cab form.\n\nS: $49,135 (up $960)\nSV: $52,955 (up $1,000)\nPro-4X: $58,915 (up $1,150)\nPlatinum Reserve: $66,865 (up $1,230)\nWireless Apple CarPlay, Midnight Edition Returns\n\nIn addition to the pricing changes, Nissan also confirmed that wireless Apple CarPlay is coming to the Titan — but only in Pro-4X and Platinum Reserve trims. The rest of the trim levels still require a wired connection in order for the truck to recognize your device. The Midnight Edition also returns, but it will only be available on SV trims equipped with a crew cab. As the name implies, the Midnight Edition comes with blacked-out accents, including 20-inch black wheels. All trims are powered by the carryover 5.6-liter V-8 mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission good for 400 horsepower.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Nissan Titan XD: The Titan’s Ultimate Towing Package?\n2020 Nissan Titan XD Review: More Power, More Payload, More Sense\nNissan Titan Slips in Crash-Test Results\n2020 Nissan Titan XD: 6 Pros and 2 Cons\nResearch the Nissan Titan\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When Nissan introduced its second-generation American-made full-size Titan pickup truck in 2015, it included something new — the Titan XD model. But Nissan didn’t explain as well as it should have what the truck was. It was called a “light-duty-plus” or a “heavy-duty-lite” pickup, a white-space model that didn’t exist among the American manufacturers. It had more towing and payload capability than the regular Titan but couldn’t match the crazy numbers put up by the Ford, Chevrolet or Ram heavy-duty pickups. It was for people who towed heavy things but didn’t want to put out the cash required for an expensive American HD pickup. It had an expensive Cummins diesel engine for people who tow, one you couldn’t get in the regular-duty Titan.\n\nRelated: 2020 Nissan Titan Review: No Longer a ‘Yeah, But’ Truck\n\nConsumers responded with a yawn, understandably. Now, there’s a revised Titan and Titan XD for 2020, and it’s finally a truck with no compromises or issues. Nissan has simplified the lineup, eliminated the rarely purchased diesel engine, made 4×4 standard and put together the new XD with a new marketing idea: Don’t think of it as a separate model, but rather as the ultimate towing package for the regular Titan. The idea makes sense — trim by trim, the XD costs anywhere from $1,300 to $4,190 more than a four-wheel-drive regular Titan. Most of the parts are common to both trucks: The bodies are the same, the interiors, the stuff you see and touch is identical between the Titan and the Titan XD. The powertrain is the same between the Titan and XD as well. But underneath, they’re not the same truck at all.\n\nBigger and Brawnier\n\nThe Titan XD may look the same up top, but it rides on a completely different frame underneath. It’s 15 inches longer and fully boxed, meaning the truck gets a full-length bed to go with the crew cab, whereas you only get a short bed with the regular Titan crew cab; the long bed can be had only on the King-Cab regular Titan. The suspension is beefier as well, and the truck is 3 inches taller than a standard Titan. So it’s a bit more of a climb up into the cabin than a regular Titan, which is made a little more challenging in the off-road Pro-4X trim level that doesn’t have any side steps to help you.\n\nOnce you’re there, the Titan XD drives much like the lesser Titan does with the exception of a slightly firmer ride. It’s not choppy or punishing by any means, and expansion joints passing beneath you on highways are little more than a whump and a memory. The XD’s steering is similar to the regular Titan’s, meaning it’s direct, well boosted and confident when the truck is empty or loaded with       a trailer. The 5.6-liter V-8 gasoline engine is the only one available, which might limit the Titan’s appeal to some folks, but it shouldn’t — it’s a fantastic motor with plenty of power and torque (400 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque, up from 390 hp and 394 pounds-feet in 2019). Acceleration when empty is brisk, and when loaded up with a heavy trailer, it’s still impressive, even up some moderate grades (I drove the Titan in Mississippi, so there were no steep grades, but we did find some brief 3 to 4% highway rises). Braking performance was excellent, thanks to the bigger 14.2-by-1.5-inch front rotors and 14.4-by-1.2-inch rear rotors, larger than what comes on the regular Titan (13.8-by-1.2-inch front, 13.6-by-0.8-inch rear).\n\nI did a lot of towing with the XD model at the launch drive just west of the truck’s birthplace of Jackson, Miss. (per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events), and was impressed with just how easily it handles itself when towing anything from a bumper-pulled Airstream trailer to a skid-steer on a gooseneck flatbed. The XD brings some beefier powertrain bits, such as a commercial-grade rear differential and a larger axle with a different final drive ratio (4.083:1 versus 3.692:1 for the regular Titan). All of this allows the Titan XD to tow up to 11,000 pounds, about 1,600 pounds more than a standard Titan can do, but considerably less than a typical American-brand heavy-duty pickup or even some light-duty ones, considering a Ford F-150 crew cab can be optioned to tow 13,200 pounds (ironically, with a twin-turbo V-6 instead of a V-8) and a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 crew cab can go up to 12,000 pounds. Not that you ever should tow that much with a light-duty pickup, but the Americans say you can.\n\nAnd while it sounds like this puts the Titan XD at a disadvantage to some other pickups in the market, it really doesn’t — all Titan XD models can tow 11,000 pounds. There’s no “maybe it can with this specific powertrain and wheelbase, and 4×2 instead of 4×4,” and so on. Since there’s only one length of XD, one body style and one powertrain, every Titan XD can tow the same number. While that does mean that there are far fewer variations and options available on a Titan XD than you can get with an American-brand truck, it also does simplify the process of choosing one — there is only one.\n\nSo the Titan XD isn’t going to win in a numbers war in terms of “which truck is rated to tow the most,” but as I’ve often said, I don’t care which one has the highest number. The majority of people who tow don’t actually know how much their stuff weighs anyway — and the towing demonstrations I put the Titan XD through proved to me that not only can it tow the things you’re likely to be towing (a 6,000-pound pontoon boat, a 10,000-pound skid-steer, an 8,000-pound box trailer), but it does so with absolutely no drama, no difficulty and no issues. Even the Pro-4X off-road model tows with better steering feel and control than the latest Tremor-package-equipped Ford Super Duty I tried recently. There’s plenty of grunt from the V-8 engine; I never ran out of steam even when I had my foot to the floor on a grade. I felt perfectly confident passing slower traffic with a load behind me in a Titan XD. Is the Titan XD a valid rival for the American heavy-duty pickups? No, it really isn’t. Is it a good tow package add-on if you want the most space and utility from a light-duty pickup? Yeah, that’s a pretty good argument.\n\nNo Longer Bottom Rung, Inside\n\nThe interior upgrade seen on the Titan carries over into the Titan XD as well. So all the improvements seen in the lesser model like dramatically better materials; a big, clear, high-mounted, optional 9-inch touchscreen with a revised multimedia system; the Zero Gravity seats; and the quiet, mostly well-organized layout that I enjoyed in the regular Titan can be enjoyed here, too. It’s not as cavernous inside as the American-brand pickups — it’s noticeably half a tick smaller in the cabin, but I’m not upset about this. After spending some time in the latest GM beasts, which I think are actually too big to easily drive in most suburban areas, the slightly tidier dimensions of the Titan XD are welcome. It didn’t feel hard to park anywhere, and I didn’t feel like I had no room to maneuver in my own lane.\n\nFuel economy really couldn’t be tested at this drive event, not accurately, so that will have to wait for a longer, in-depth test later this year. But overall, I’ve come away impressed at what Nissan has crafted with the Titan XD. I’d say it easily drives as well as the latest generation of Chevrolet and GMC pickups, and is a more pleasant place to be thanks to material quality that’s better than what GM is slapping in pickups these days, even on their supposed luxury trims. The ride isn’t quite as supple as the Ram 1500’s coil-spring rear suspension allows, but again the interior materials aren’t far off the Ram benchmark, and the big touchscreen’s ease of use rivals the Ram’s massive 12-inch vertical stack for clarity and usability, and bests the Ford F-150’s Sync system in terms of size.\n\nIt’s also reasonably priced, starting at $46,175 (prices include destination fee) and ranging up to a loaded $63,285, which puts it comfortably in the neighborhood of the comparable American-brand pickups as well, albeit with more standard safety equipment. No, the Titan XD won’t be all things to all people — you can’t get one made “your way,” enjoying the myriad combinations afforded to the Big Three brands thanks to the massive volume they enjoy. But for the majority of casual buyers and enthusiast users, the Titan XD might actually make a lot of sense thanks to its comfort, usability, capability and amenities.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When Nissan introduced its second-generation American-made full-size Titan pickup truck in 2015, it included something new — the Titan XD model. But Nissan didn’t explain as well as it should have what the truck was. It was called a “light-duty-plus” or a “heavy-duty-lite” pickup, a white-space model that didn’t exist among the American manufacturers. It had more towing and payload capability than the regular Titan but couldn’t match the crazy numbers put up by the Ford, Chevrolet or Ram heavy-duty pickups. It was for people who towed heavy things but didn’t want to put out the cash required for an expensive American HD pickup. It had an expensive Cummins diesel engine for people who tow, one you couldn’t get in the regular-duty Titan.\n\nRelated: 2020 Nissan Titan Review: No Longer a ‘Yeah, But’ Truck\n\nConsumers responded with a yawn, understandably. Now, there’s a revised Titan and Titan XD for 2020, and it’s finally a truck with no compromises or issues. Nissan has simplified the lineup, eliminated the rarely purchased diesel engine, made 4×4 standard and put together the new XD with a new marketing idea: Don’t think of it as a separate model, but rather as the ultimate towing package for the regular Titan. The idea makes sense — trim by trim, the XD costs anywhere from $1,300 to $4,190 more than a four-wheel-drive regular Titan. Most of the parts are common to both trucks: The bodies are the same, the interiors, the stuff you see and touch is identical between the Titan and the Titan XD. The powertrain is the same between the Titan and XD as well. But underneath, they’re not the same truck at all.\n\nBigger and Brawnier\n\nThe Titan XD may look the same up top, but it rides on a completely different frame underneath. It’s 15 inches longer and fully boxed, meaning the truck gets a full-length bed to go with the crew cab, whereas you only get a short bed with the regular Titan crew cab; the long bed can be had only on the King-Cab regular Titan. The suspension is beefier as well, and the truck is 3 inches taller than a standard Titan. So it’s a bit more of a climb up into the cabin than a regular Titan, which is made a little more challenging in the off-road Pro-4X trim level that doesn’t have any side steps to help you.\n\nOnce you’re there, the Titan XD drives much like the lesser Titan does with the exception of a slightly firmer ride. It’s not choppy or punishing by any means, and expansion joints passing beneath you on highways are little more than a whump and a memory. The XD’s steering is similar to the regular Titan’s, meaning it’s direct, well boosted and confident when the truck is empty or loaded with       a trailer. The 5.6-liter V-8 gasoline engine is the only one available, which might limit the Titan’s appeal to some folks, but it shouldn’t — it’s a fantastic motor with plenty of power and torque (400 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque, up from 390 hp and 394 pounds-feet in 2019). Acceleration when empty is brisk, and when loaded up with a heavy trailer, it’s still impressive, even up some moderate grades (I drove the Titan in Mississippi, so there were no steep grades, but we did find some brief 3 to 4% highway rises). Braking performance was excellent, thanks to the bigger 14.2-by-1.5-inch front rotors and 14.4-by-1.2-inch rear rotors, larger than what comes on the regular Titan (13.8-by-1.2-inch front, 13.6-by-0.8-inch rear).\n\nI did a lot of towing with the XD model at the launch drive just west of the truck’s birthplace of Jackson, Miss. (per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events), and was impressed with just how easily it handles itself when towing anything from a bumper-pulled Airstream trailer to a skid-steer on a gooseneck flatbed. The XD brings some beefier powertrain bits, such as a commercial-grade rear differential and a larger axle with a different final drive ratio (4.083:1 versus 3.692:1 for the regular Titan). All of this allows the Titan XD to tow up to 11,000 pounds, about 1,600 pounds more than a standard Titan can do, but considerably less than a typical American-brand heavy-duty pickup or even some light-duty ones, considering a Ford F-150 crew cab can be optioned to tow 13,200 pounds (ironically, with a twin-turbo V-6 instead of a V-8) and a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 crew cab can go up to 12,000 pounds. Not that you ever should tow that much with a light-duty pickup, but the Americans say you can.\n\nAnd while it sounds like this puts the Titan XD at a disadvantage to some other pickups in the market, it really doesn’t — all Titan XD models can tow 11,000 pounds. There’s no “maybe it can with this specific powertrain and wheelbase, and 4×2 instead of 4×4,” and so on. Since there’s only one length of XD, one body style and one powertrain, every Titan XD can tow the same number. While that does mean that there are far fewer variations and options available on a Titan XD than you can get with an American-brand truck, it also does simplify the process of choosing one — there is only one.\n\nSo the Titan XD isn’t going to win in a numbers war in terms of “which truck is rated to tow the most,” but as I’ve often said, I don’t care which one has the highest number. The majority of people who tow don’t actually know how much their stuff weighs anyway — and the towing demonstrations I put the Titan XD through proved to me that not only can it tow the things you’re likely to be towing (a 6,000-pound pontoon boat, a 10,000-pound skid-steer, an 8,000-pound box trailer), but it does so with absolutely no drama, no difficulty and no issues. Even the Pro-4X off-road model tows with better steering feel and control than the latest Tremor-package-equipped Ford Super Duty I tried recently. There’s plenty of grunt from the V-8 engine; I never ran out of steam even when I had my foot to the floor on a grade. I felt perfectly confident passing slower traffic with a load behind me in a Titan XD. Is the Titan XD a valid rival for the American heavy-duty pickups? No, it really isn’t. Is it a good tow package add-on if you want the most space and utility from a light-duty pickup? Yeah, that’s a pretty good argument.\n\nNo Longer Bottom Rung, Inside\n\nThe interior upgrade seen on the Titan carries over into the Titan XD as well. So all the improvements seen in the lesser model like dramatically better materials; a big, clear, high-mounted, optional 9-inch touchscreen with a revised multimedia system; the Zero Gravity seats; and the quiet, mostly well-organized layout that I enjoyed in the regular Titan can be enjoyed here, too. It’s not as cavernous inside as the American-brand pickups — it’s noticeably half a tick smaller in the cabin, but I’m not upset about this. After spending some time in the latest GM beasts, which I think are actually too big to easily drive in most suburban areas, the slightly tidier dimensions of the Titan XD are welcome. It didn’t feel hard to park anywhere, and I didn’t feel like I had no room to maneuver in my own lane.\n\nFuel economy really couldn’t be tested at this drive event, not accurately, so that will have to wait for a longer, in-depth test later this year. But overall, I’ve come away impressed at what Nissan has crafted with the Titan XD. I’d say it easily drives as well as the latest generation of Chevrolet and GMC pickups, and is a more pleasant place to be thanks to material quality that’s better than what GM is slapping in pickups these days, even on their supposed luxury trims. The ride isn’t quite as supple as the Ram 1500’s coil-spring rear suspension allows, but again the interior materials aren’t far off the Ram benchmark, and the big touchscreen’s ease of use rivals the Ram’s massive 12-inch vertical stack for clarity and usability, and bests the Ford F-150’s Sync system in terms of size.\n\nIt’s also reasonably priced, starting at $46,175 (prices include destination fee) and ranging up to a loaded $63,285, which puts it comfortably in the neighborhood of the comparable American-brand pickups as well, albeit with more standard safety equipment. No, the Titan XD won’t be all things to all people — you can’t get one made “your way,” enjoying the myriad combinations afforded to the Big Three brands thanks to the massive volume they enjoy. But for the majority of casual buyers and enthusiast users, the Titan XD might actually make a lot of sense thanks to its comfort, usability, capability and amenities.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nNissan’s going after customers in need of a stronger half-ton pickup or heavy-duty customers who don’t appreciate the unnecessary tradeoffs with its new-for-2016 Titan XD.\n\nThis all-new pickup hopes to better compete with the dominating players in the segment: the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ram 1500, GMC Sierra 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nNew for 2015The Nissan strategy is to essentially create two half-ton pickups: one heavier-duty hard-working model called the Titan XD that will go on sale first at the end of 2015 and only be offered with the new twin-turbo-diesel 5.0-liter V-8 Cummins and then offer a more personal-use, lighter-duty half-ton pickup later in 2016 that will offer a choice of V-8 and V-6 engines.\n\nThis Titan XD has an all-new chassis will offer a maximum towing capacity above 12,000 pounds and offers a payload capacity of 2,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nThe new Titan has a new exterior and interior look, and it offers many bed conveniences like LED lighting, multiple cargo rails and optional storage boxes.\n\nExterior HighlightsNissan designers started the new truck’s look with a gladiator’s helmet and incorporated many of those same cues into the front grille and tailgate. To house the big Cummins engine, Nissan made the grille and hood bulge larger than any of the competitive set.\n\nAlong the side of the truck, Nissan removed many of the flat surfaces and added swoops and curves over the front and rear fenders. Much of the front and side design cuts are tailored to smoothly move air over and around the large surfaces for better aerodynamics and fuel economy.\n\nAdditionally, Nissan now uses a single front bumper design to mitigate the number air-grabbing surface connections. The front also sports larger headlamps and LED accents, along with a stamped Titan name into the upper grille. Likewise, the name of the truck is stamped on the top of the tailgate. \n\nInterior HighlightsProbably the greatest improvement with this new version Titan XD is how much better looking the updated instrument panel is. Seating materials and soft-touch dash surfaces are improved with much cleaner labels and controls. New Titans now have an information screen between the speedometer and tachometer, as well as a 7-inch navigation screen that can offer a top-view 360-degree camera. Finally, all Nissan Titans will have a column shifter, which opens up quite a bit more room for extra storage space, hidden compartments and larger cupholders. The doors have been carefully redesigned to accommodate larger items.\n\nThe Nissan Titan will have five trim packages: S, SV, PRO-4X, , SL and Platinum Reserve. The truck will be offered in three cab configurations — regular, king, and crew — with several wheelbases, and three bed lengths.\n\nUnder the HoodThe all-new twin-turbo-diesel 5.0-liter V-8 Cummins will be the first engine available on Titan XDs, with a V-6 and V-8 coming online in 2016.\n\nPower ratings for the 5.0 Cummins are 310 horsepower and 555 pounds-feet of torque, offering 20 percent better fuel economy when towing full loads than a comparably sized gas engine, as well as 45 percent more torque. Power ratings have not been released. The current 4.0-liter V-6 is rated at 261 hp and 281 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nSafety FeaturesAmong some of the new safety features, Nissan will be the first truckmaker to include a trailer light check with blind spot and front and rear sonar warning lights and sounds. Other safety gear will include an integrated brake controller for towing, trailer sway control, LED lighting in the bed, standard tailgate assist and an electronically controlled rear locking differential.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Nissan Titan XD?\n\nThe Nissan Titan XD is designed to bridge the gap between conventional light-duty and heavy-duty full-size pickup trucks. It seats up to six and features a standard 390-horsepower, gas 5.6-liter V-8 engine paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission or an available 310-hp, turbo-diesel 5.0-liter V-8 that works with a six-speed automatic. When properly equipped, the diesel-powered Titan XD can tow up to 12,710 pounds using a conventional trailer hitch. Three cabs — single cab, King Cab (extended cab) and crew cab — are offered as well as rear- and four-wheel-drive models. Competitors include the Ford F-250 Super Duty, Ram 2500 and Chevrolet Silverado 2500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Nissan Titan XD?\n\nAudiophiles will appreciate a newly available Fender premium stereo, and all models now have a second USB port and a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Nissan’s Rear Door Alert, which reminds you to check the backseat, is now included on King Cab and crew-cab trucks. There’s also a new integrated gooseneck hitch in the cargo bed and a larger-capacity DEF tank in diesel-powered trucks.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Nissan Titan XD Are Most Important?\n\nThe Titan XD offers two bed lengths: a 6-foot-5-inch bed and an 8-foot bed as well as plenty of available utilitarian goodies like a spray-on bedliner, a 120-volt household power outlet in the bed and a tie-down system with adjustable aluminum cleats.\n\nIn addition to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, the standard touchscreen multimedia system also supports Bluetooth streaming audio. Built-in navigation is optional. Standard convenience features include remote keyless entry and power windows. Luxury options include leather upholstery, heated and cooled front seats, a power-adjustable steering column, a heated steering wheel and a power-sliding rear window. Optional active safety features include a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Nissan Titan XD?\n\nThe Titan XD's greater capability and available diesel engine will appeal to those who need a truck that's stouter than the light-duty norm. We'd like to see more active safety features and an update to the steering system, but if you don't need or want to go all-in on a heavy-duty pickup truck from one of the domestic brands, the Titan XD represents a unique middle-ground.",
