      "expert_review": "With an all-new Nissan Kicks now in showrooms, the first-generation Kicks will remain on sale for 2025 under the new name Kicks Play. The compact crossover will serve as a (slightly) lower-cost alternative to the redesigned 2025 Kicks. \n\nRelated: 2025 Nissan Kicks Review: Aesthetic Affordability\n\nThe Kicks Play’s features carry over from the 2024 Kicks S trim. These include cruise control, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, three USB ports (one in the front, two for rear passengers), 16-inch steel wheels, Easy-Fill Tire Alert and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. The standard Nissan Safety Shield 360 suite features automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, reverse automatic braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nNissan Maintenance Care is also included, covering up to three oil changes during the first two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Nissan Kicks Play uses the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine as before, producing 122 horsepower and 114 pounds-feet of torque. It is paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.\n\nOfficial EPA fuel-economy figures aren’t yet available, but they shouldn’t change from the 2024 Kicks’ 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Nissan Kicks Play will be available solely in the S trim level with a starting price of $22,910 (includes $1,390 destination fee). The Kicks Play goes on sale in early 2025.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAffordable, Efficient, Transitory: 2024 Nissan Kicks Starts at $22,125\n2025 Nissan Kicks Up Close: Maturing, But Not Too Much\nRedesigned 2025 Nissan Kicks Priced From $23,220\nResearch the Nissan Kicks\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
