      "expert_review": "In a sea of new sheet metal and new models, there are older models that deserve consideration, even if they don’t have a lot of visible changes. Two vehicles that see minor changes are Nissan’s Quest minivan and Honda’s Accord.\n\nNISSAN QUEST\n\nChrysler fired the first shot in the minivan door wars when it offered its redesigned minivans with a left-side sliding door to complement the one on the right side. Nissan’s Quest doesn’t have one, so quickly will be pushed aside on many people’s shopping lists.\n\nToo bad, for despite the age of the design, the Quest (and it’s identical cousin the Mercury Villager) handle with a car-like ease, something increasingly common among minivans.\n\nWith a 151 horsepower V6 tugging around nearly 4,000 pounds, this vehicle is no speed demon. Yet from behind the wheel, its doesn’t seem sluggish in the least. There’s good power from low speeds, despite the a single-overhead-cam engine, a design that usually lacks good low-speed torque. Handling is as good as any family car, the suspension absorbing Third World-like road shocks with little trouble. The smallish front disc, rear drum brakes have anti-lock at all four wheels. Anti-lock is optional on the base XE van, standard on the top of the line GXE.\n\nFor 1997, the Quest was treated to a makeover, with new door panels, switch gear and fabrics. The two trim levels, XE and GXE, differ mainly in equipment levels, but both get the same drivetrain. The interior is an odd amalgamation of Ford and Nissan parts. They all work together somehow, and you’d be hard-pressed to tell which company produced what. The drivetrain is all Nissan, but its built in a Ford plant. The chair-high seats provided good support and comfort. The middle row of captain’s chairs were also quite comfortable. The rear row had average space, although it was far from overwhelming. Like many third rows, it was somewhat awkward to access gracefully.\n\nThe test vehicle was a GXE model, with all the power options any respectable family hauler has.\n\nSecurity system, keyless entry, 80-watt AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio system, steering-wheel mounted audio controls, extra power outlets, folding seatback tray tables and lots of cupholders are standard in the $26,049 base price.\n\nAlso standard are anti-lock brakes and dual airbags. Gilding the lily is the Luxury Package (automatic climate control, power sunroof and 6-CD changer) and a leather package (leather seating surfaces, 4-way power passenger seat, simulated leather door trim).\n\nThose packages brought the tariff to a healthy $29,366.\n\nEPA ratings are 17 mpg city, 23 mpg highway. Mixed driving brought a respectable 19 mpg.\n\nThe seating is amazingly flexible. Both rear seats slide forward, in addition to folding flat creating, small tables. There’s the usual assortment of cubbyholes, extra air outlets and an extra audio outlet, so you don’t have to listen to what currently passes for pop music. It’s all very convenient and comfortable.\n\nThere are few better ways to transport your cargo. With its flexible seating, big interior yet modest exterior, car-like handling and copious options list, it’s little wonder that minivans have found their way into the hearts of soccer moms everywhere. And even if other minivans have higher profiles and new sheet metal, the Nissan Quest has plenty to recommend it against newer competitors.\n\nJust don’t ask for an extra door.\n\nHONDA ACCORD\n\nWhen it comes to trying to sell cars, most automakers — foreign and domestic — will go to great lengths to pitch their product.\n\nThe big trend now is to hire brand managers who oversee the message that is sent out regarding a car or truck, making sure it has a consistent image. But it’s really a whole lot simpler than that. Just build a great car.\n\nSounds simple, right?\n\nJust ask Honda. The people who ask you in their advertising to simplify, manage to sell m re Accords than just about any other sedan. Is it their low-key advertising? Their nifty brand marketers?\n\nNope.\n\nWhat makes the Accord so popular is the car. It’s just about right.\n\nThe styling is conservative yet classy and manages to pull off a deft balancing act — at home, at the club or at Kmart. It’s clean and contemporary, yet never manages to look cheap, something that can’t be said of it’s competitors. Inside, the low seating position and low-slung dash make an optimum driving position.\n\nAlthough you’re sitting on the ground, it accentuates the car’s handling. It has a slot-car feel, and it invites you toss it around. While the six-cylinder can be tons of fun, the four cylinder accounts for itself pretty well. With just 130 horsepower (versus the six’s 170), you won’t be winning any stoplight gran prix, but it won’t feel winded going uphill.\n\nUnlike some cars that call themselves mid-size, this one truely is. Not as small as a Prism, yet not as large as Lumina, this car will hold four comfortably, five in a pinch. The dash itself is artful in its simplicity, almost elegant. The seats are supportive and covered in an oh-so tasteful cloth.\n\nBut you knew all this already. So what’s really news about the Honda Accord?\n\nJust this: if you’re looking for one, check out the SE model. This is a Special Edition that takes a four-cylinder Accord (already equipped with an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power windows, locks and mirrors, cruise control, fold-down rear seat-back and rear defogger) and groups it with a special options package that you usually can’t find in a four-cylinder Accord at a lower price point.\n\nThe options include alloy wheels, AM/ FM CD player, leather-wrapped steering wheel, security system, keyless entry, fake wood trim and a power moonroof.\n\nThe bottom line is $21,925.\n\nSo what you get is a lot of goodies in a tidy package at a decent price. Add in good mileage (the EPA rating of 23 mpg city, 30 mpg highway was met with a solid 24 mpg) and you have a car worth checking out.\n\nIf you’re a driving enthusiast, however, you’ll find this is more a luxury-oriented package than a driving-oriented one. The lack of rear disc brakes and ABS availability is a negative. So is the loud security system, which sounds the horn too loudly.\n\nBut with the average price of a new car now at about $21,000, a car this well equipped for that price is worth checking out. Give it a look.",

      "expert_review": "Minivans offer little inspiration. There is little about them that beckons the poet, especially on a gray, rain-soaked day.\n\nDrip, drip, splatter, minivan. Nothing to prompt movement from the couch to the outdoors. Nothing except duty and limited time for test drives, which is why I finally left the comfort of home to drive the 1998 Nissan Quest GXE.\n\nIt is a short-wheelbase minivan, more on the order of the original Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Its body is tubular, accented by a rounded nose and gently curved rear. In terms of design, it is the essence of functionality.\n\nStepping inside the test model on a dismal Saturday afternoon was an exercise in discipline, for the interior was uniformly gray. And the seats were of a material more akin to high-grade sackcloth. Was I in a minivan or a monastery?\n\nThe answer was in movement, which the Quest GXE did exceptionally well. For all its drabness, the thing was a runner, which encouraged me to extend the drive deep into Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, where late winter’s mist became a gossamer veil.\n\nAt a rest stop on the return trip, I examined the Quest GXE’s particulars, especially the maneuverability of its seats, which is a big selling point for the Nissan Quest and its Ford Motor Co. twin, the Mercury Villager. The manufacturers’ claims about the ease of rearranging the Nissan Quest’s seats are true. Using floor-mounted tracks, the seats can be reconfigured 24 ways. I tried only six, because all that moving about was beginning to attract the attention of a Virginia state trooper patrolling the area.\n\nSome fellow auto scribes have complained that the Nissan Quest’s V-6 engine is noisy. I did not notice this. The 3-liter V-6, the only engine available for the Quest, produces 151 horsepower at 4,800rpm and 174 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. It’s not noisy; it’s a hummer.\n\nOne transmission is offered, an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic. But the Quest, a front-wheel-drive vehicle designed to seat as many as seven people, comes in three trim levels, the base XE, GXE and luxury GLE.\n\nThe tested GXE gets four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, rear air conditioning, steering-wheel mounted sound system controls, a power driver’s seat (which gets demerits for the poor ergonomic design of its controls) and captain’s chairs as standard equipment.\n\nThe GLE gets power seats for the driver and front passenger, a power moon roof and leather upholstery, though it seems a waste to put all that fancy stuff in something that essentially is a family bus and cargo hauler.\n\n1998 Nissan Quest\n\nComplaints: The Nissan Quest comes with three side doors in a world where four is becoming the norm — even for minivans. The absence of that fourth door complicates access to the rear seats.\n\nPraise: My latent bias against minivans aside, both the Quest and the Mercury Villager are overall solid, well-designed family mobiles. The people who buy them aren’t looking for poetry. They want reliability and practicality, and they get lots of both in the Quest.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Zilch.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent overall ride, even for back-seaters. Excellent acceleration. Good handling, but brakes could use some work. I had to squeeze them in the test vehicle to get good stops.\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags; three-point seat belts; steel, pipe-style, side-impact door beams; child-safety lock on the sliding door; available, built-in child-safety seat in the second-row seats of the XE and GXE models.\n\nMileage: About 18miles per gallon. Tank holds 20 gallons of recommended 87-octane unleaded. Estimated driving range on usable volume of fuel is 350 miles, running mostly highway and driver only with no cargo. (Cargo capacity varies from 14.1 cubic feet to 114.8 cubic feet, depending on seating arrangement.)\n\nSound system: Four-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with console-mounted six-disc CD changer. Installed by Nissan. Good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Quest GXE is $26,049. Dealer invoice is $23,186. Price as tested is $27,768, including $1,249 in options and a $470 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Pricey, considering the competition. Compare with the Villager, short-wheelbase Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager, Chevrolet Venture, Honda Odyssey, and Toyota Sienna.",

The No. 2 American and Japanese automakers have teamed up to produce the new Nissan Quest/\n\nMercury Villager – and I would call it the platinum standard of the industry.\n\nBriefly, Ford and Nissan engineers huddled for a couple of years and did what they call ”benchmarking.” That’s where an automaker buys vehicles from the competition and tears them apart.\n\nThe engineers find the best part of each competitive vehicle and design their vehicle to be better.\n\nAfter talking to owners of both Mercury Villagers and Nissan Quests and putting in a week and about 450 miles on a Quest, a few fairly minor gripes did emerge. But overall, it looks as if Chrysler now has some real competition.\n\nWith the 1993 model year about to get the checkered flag, I would have to rank this week’s test vehicle, the Nissan Quest GXE, as the best all-round vehicle I’ve driven this year.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Quest is powered with a 3.0-liter V-6 engine that delivers 151 of the smoothest, quietest horsepower you’ll find in a minivan.\n\nIn fact, Quest sets the standard that Chrysler and the others will have to meet or beat in their next-generation minivans. The engine’s low noise and vibration are not totally muffled – you wouldn’t want it that way – but most times you must make the effort to listen for the engine if you want to hear it.\n\nThe engine, a derivative of the one powering the Nissan Maxima sports sedan, is lively and responsive all the way up to 65 mph. From a stop, the Quest accelerates quickly and very easily. Unlike some minivans, passing slower traffic presents no problem at, say, 35 mph.\n\nOur test vehicle, like all Quests,came with an exceptionally well-refined computer-controlled, four-speed, overdrive automatic transmission. A switch to operate the overdrive is located at the end of the shift lever on the steering column. It can be operated by the light touch of the driver’s thumb.\n\nIf ever there was a vehicle that came with a drivetrain perfectly matched to the suspension, steering and brakes, the Quest is it.\n\nFuel mileage in city driving using the air conditioner averaged about 18 miles per gallon. On a road trip, that figure climbed to about 24 mpg of regular unleaded.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Quest’s handling is the best you’ll find in a minivan.\n\nThe last time I drove a Chrysler minivan – a Dodge Caravan – I discovered it really couldn’t be driven very aggressively without provoking a racket from the tires.\n\nBut you can drive the Quest as hard as you please. The body is stiff, firm and able to handle all sorts of maneuvers that would leave lesser vehicles in the dust.\n\nNot many people would drive a minivan like they would a sports car, but I did. I pushed the Quest and pushed it hard.\n\nNo matter how good a driver you are, it is reassuring to know that if you find yourself in a situation that calls for a quick accident avoidance maneuver, such as a sharp, fast turn with the brakes applied, the Quest will see you through with no problem.\n\nSmooth and balanced are the two words that best sum up the performance of the Quest’s suspension, steering and brake systems.\n\nA 39-foot turning radius makes the Quest easy to steer in tight places, like a supermarket parking lot. The front disc/rear drum brakes have an anti-lock system that stops the Quest quickly and without undue theatrics. A MacPherson strut front suspension and rear live axle help give the Quest a soft but sporty ride.\n\nOne of the engineers’ goals in designing the Quest was to make it carlike in its handling. They not only accomplished that mission but raised the standards for everyone else.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFrom its smooth and easy-to-use sliding side door to the incredible versatility of its seats, the Quest is the most user-friendly and most intelligently engineered minivan I have yet to test.\n\nThe Quest seats seven. From the outside, the Quest doesn’t appear as big as other minivans. But on the inside, no one is left wanting for legroom, headroom or foot room.\n\nThe rear bench seat folds and slides on a track to increase the storage room. Or it can easily be lifted out. The middle also can be configured numerous ways, or taken out with the quick flick of a lever.\n\nOur test vehicle came with everything but a CD player. It had a rear air-conditioning system, a rear control panel for the radio, power sunroof, electric windows, mirrors and door locks, cruise control, leather seating and many other luxury items.\n\nOne or two minor improvements would make the Quest a bit better. For instance, you have to use the key to open the rear glass from the tailgate, even when the vehicle is unlocked. A latch that would unlock it from the driver’s seat would have been nice. And several times I accidently turned on the windshield wipers when I pressed down on the turn signal lever.\n\nThe 1994 models have arrived at Nissan dealers, and the biggest complaint buyers have voiced has been addressed – the vehicles now have a driver’s air bag.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Nissan Quest and its fraternal twin, the Mercury Villager, are the best minivans money can buy. Pleasing performance, a terrific interior, attractive styling and flawless assembly are just a few of their highlights.",

      "expert_review": "Let me take a moment to introduce myself. I am not an automotive expert or car buff. I am a mother of two young children, and I spend my glamorous days in sweats, driving car pool and running errands. Sadly, I spend more time in my car than any other place. It’s this admission that fuels my quest to find the ultimate “mom-mobile.”\n\nAt first glance, the 2004 Nissan Quest appears very different from other minivans on the market. I’ll even venture to say it looks sexy. Yes, you read right: I called this minivan sexy. Nissan has done a great job marketing this vehicle as “what women want,” but did it actually have a woman test it before putting it on the market?\n\nI love the advertisements for the 2004 Nissan Quest. After watching them, I find myself fantasizing about spending the day surfing, painting or playing the cello (all without my kids), then hitting the town for a hot night out with my husband (and no kids). In the real world, however, I drive the mommy express. I decided (rather masochistically) that the best way to test this minivan would be to load up the troops (two children, my husband and in-laws) for a 10-hour road trip.\n\nRight off the bat I discover that the rear doors open very wide for easy access to all three rows of seats. The seats are wide and flat and make a stable base for car seats. The interior of the cabin is very spacious, with plenty of room to move about (helpful for reaching the perpetually vomiting baby in back). The cargo area of the Quest dips below floor level, lending an amazing amount of cargo space. With six people in this car we still have plenty of room for all our luggage, plus three coolers. The grocery bag hooks behind the third row are perfect for holding duffel bags.\n\nAfter loading my clan, I hop in the driver’s seat. I’m struck by the unusual dashboard design. In my husband’s words, it looks like the Starship Enterprise. (Does it come with a transporter so I can skip this road trip altogether?) I explore the storage compartments (of which there are many) and cupholders (which are inconveniently located). I try to hang my purse on the “purse and hat hook,” but to no avail. This seemingly great innovation is poorly placed and my purse ends up on the floor.\n\nThe entry-level Quest 3.5S has manually adjusting seats. I crank two separate wheels to raise the seat to a suitable level. The steering wheel is too far away, though, and I end up driving with my arms stretched at an odd angle.\n\nPulling into the first pit stop, I notice the hood slopes so steeply that I can’t see the front end of the vehicle. This makes parking difficult. I inch the car forward until it bumps the curb. I have trouble finding a suitable place in the car for changing the baby’s diaper and end up using the cooler as a changing table.\n\nI decide to let my husband take a turn driving while I rest. Did I say rest? I don’t think so. The suspension on this minivan makes even small bumps in the road feel like Mt. Everest. Not to mention a very loud cabin from wind noise.\n\nWhen we finally arrive at our destination I discover how useful a navigation system would have been (unfortunately it’s not even an option on the S model). We spend most of the weekend lost wandering some not-so-safe areas of the city. This leads me to discover another oversight with the 2004 Nissan Quest. The door locks aren’t color coded to let you know when they’re engaged. I have to actually open the door before discovering that it’s not locked.\n\nIn summary, the 2004 Nissan Quest 3.5S needs some tweaking before I’ll recommend it to any of my girlfriends. In this case, beauty only runs skin deep. If you’re dead set on the aesthetic qualities of this particular minivan, I recommend researching the SL or SE models. If you can afford it, spring for leather seats and automatic opening doors.\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Quest and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA cousin to the Mercury Villager, Nissans minivan will cease production in the summer of 2002. Alloy wheels were restyled for the 2002 GXE and SE models, and option packages have been revised.\n\nThe Quest comes in three flavors: GXE, sporty SE and the luxurious GLE. Both the Quest and Villager have been produced at the same plant in Ohio as a joint venture between Nissan and Ford. Each was redesigned for 1999, and the two differ mainly in their front-end appearance. The Villager will also disappear in the summer of 2002.\n\nLike most minivans, the Quest has seen declining popularity. Sales fell by almost 32 percent in the 2001 calendar year, to just 29,232 units, according to Automotive News. The Mercury Villager has been even less popular with only 22,046 units sold during 2001. Mercury will not issue a redesigned Villager but is expected to launch a replacement, likely in 2003.\n\nAt Detroits North American International Auto Show in January 2002, Nissan exhibited a stunning Quest concept minivan. This signaled the companys intention to revive the Quest later on. We have quite a number of very satisfied current Quest owners, says Jack Collins, Nissans vice president of product planning, so having a minivan in the lineup is very important. In addition, Nissan has many young customers who will need a minivan as they go through family formation and start having children. The next Quest will be produced at a new plant in Mississippi, which will not be completed until 2003.\n\nExterior\nThe Quest rides a 112.2-inch wheelbase, measures 194.6 inches long overall and stands 64.2 inches tall; the height grows to 67.3 inches with the addition of a roof rack.\n\nDual-sliding side doors are installed, but power operation is not available. All models have 16-inch wheels and a rear stabilizer bar, and the SE has a sport-tuned suspension. Maximum interior volume for cargo storage totals 127.6 cubic feet.\n\nInterior\nSpace is provided for seven occupants in the Quest. SE and GLE models have two captains chairs in the second row. The GXE has a removable two-place bench seat in the second row, which is available with optional child-safety seats. All versions have a three-passenger bench in the third row, which slides fore and aft on tracks in the floor.\n\nStandard GXE equipment includes power windows and door locks, a cassette stereo, tilt steering and remote keyless entry. The SE adds rear air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and heated mirrors.\n\nIn SE and GLE minivans, a message center incorporates an outside-temperature display. A 130-watt seven-speaker Super Sound system goes into SE and GLE models, with Radio Data Systems (RDS) technology and steering-wheel controls. Heated front seats are included in the GLE, which also comes with leather upholstery, an in-dash six-CD changer, a wood/leather-wrapped steering wheel, and powered rear quarter windows, memory drivers seat and mirrors. The GLE also has a multi-adjustable rear cargo shelf that holds items up to 30 pounds in secure compartments. Called the Smart Shelf, its available in other models as part of an option group.\n\nQuests without a sunroof can get an optional rear-seat Family Entertainment System that features a flip-down, 6.4-inch video screen, a hidden VCR and headphones. Models with a sunroof are equipped with a different entertainment system, which features a video screen that pops up from a floor console.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike the Mercury Villager, the Quest uses a 170-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine that mates to a four-speed-automatic transmission. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, front seat belt pretensioners and LATCH child-seat tethers are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOn the road, both the Quest and Villager give the impression of being smaller than many of their competitors. In reality, the Quests external dimensions put it between the typical regular-length and the extended-wheelbase minivan.\n\nPerformance and handling are wholly adequate but not exceptional. The available rear cargo shelf is a handy accessory for stowing grocery bags and odd-shaped items.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "NISSAN QUEST IS IN A TOUGH LEAGUE\n\nWhen it comes to minivans, Nissan sales have never been able to approach the volume of market leaders like Chrysler, due more to the tough competition in the minivan segment than to any real shortcoming of its product.\n\nThe Nissan Quest is a perfectly acceptable minivan, but there are at least nine other perfectly acceptable minivans on the market, so the Quest’s slice of the pie isn’t as large as Nissan would like.\n\nA central reason: Nissan not only faces competition from Dodge, Honda, Kia, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Mazda, Toyota and Ford, but from Mercury, which sells a near-identical version of the Quest, called the Villager. The twins were designed by Nissan and are assembled in a Ford plant in Ohio, using mostly Nissan parts.\n\nThis odd partnership will continue through the 2002 model year, after which the relationship dissolves. Expect an all-new Nissan Quest in 2003, likely as a 2004 model.\n\nUntil then, if you need a smallish front-wheel-drive minivan, the Quest is well worth a look. It underwent a major makeover in 1999 and has remained relatively unchanged since. The only available engine is a 3.3-liter, 170-horsepower V-6, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThere are three Quest models, with even the base GXE model quite well equipped. Standard equipment includes front air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, 16-inch tires with alloy wheels, cruise control, an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player, keyless entry and power windows, mirrors and locks.\n\nUpgrade to the midlevel SE and you get all that plus a compact disc player and steering wheel-mounted audio controls, rear air conditioning, fog lights, a roof rack, and a slightly stiffer suspension, with bigger tires. Of the three models, the SE is the sportiest.\n\nThe luxury model is the GLE, which was the test vehicle. That package adds equipment such as leather upholstery, heated power front seats and an in-dash, six-disc CD changer. The SE’s stiffer suspension isn’t included.\n\nOutside, the Quest is handsome but moderately generic. With an overall length of 194.6 inches and a width of 74.9 inches, it’s 5.6 inches shorter than a Honda Odyssey and 1.4 inches narrower.\n\nInside, Nissan makes very good use of the available space. Front seats are supportive, and the two second-row captain’s chairs (the GXE has a two-passenger bench seat available) are comfortable. The three-passenger third-row seat is best left for kids or small adults, especially for long trips.\n\nWith that third-row seat in place (second-row seats are removable, and the third-row seat can fold down and move forward on rails), there isn’t much room in the back for groceries or luggage, but the Quest’s adjustable rear shelf makes good use of what space there is.\n\nOn the road, the Quest’s smaller size makes it more maneuverable than some of its competitors. The ride is supple, just slightly jarring on uneven pavement.\n\nThe Quest GLE weighs in at just over two tons — about average for this market segment — and though the 3.3-liter V-6 is willing, it will win few drag races. The 3.0-liter V-6 in the Toyota Sienna, for example, has 210 horsepower, 40 more than the Quest. Even so, Nissan claims the Quest can tow a 3,500-pound trailer. Also a problem for Nissan: Side air bags and power-operated sliding doors aren’t available, as they are on some other minivans.\n\nThe Quest is pricier than some of the competition, offset for 2001 by the availability of a $1,299 optional kid-oriented “Family Entertainment System” that is included for free on some models. At least seven Quest GLEs and SEs on the lot at a local dealership had the free system installed.\n\nIt consists of a 6.4-inch color TV screen just behind the front seats that flips down from the roof, and a video cassette player hidden in the center console between the front seats. There’s a rear-seat remote control, so parents need not be bot d. It works quite well (all the rear windows are tinted, so the screen is easy to see), and should serve as a very effective baby sitter.\n\nEven with the system thrown in, the test GLE wasn’t cheap. Base price was $27,049, with minor options and a $540 destination charge, bringing the bottom line to $28,266.\n\nIf you don’t need the GLE’s leather and simulated wood trim or its other luxo-features, you can find a well-equipped GXE for about $4,000 less. And because all the Quests have the same engine and transmission, performance is about the same for all models.\n\nThere’s plenty to like about the Quest, not the least of which is the fact that Nissan stores, well aware of the competitive minivan market, are ready to deal. If you don’t need a big minivan like the Odyssey or Ford Windstar, it’s worth your attention.\n\nBase price: $27,049 (for top-of-the-line GLE model)\n\nPrice as tested: $28,266\n\nEPA rating: 17 mpg city, 23 mpg highway",

      "expert_review": "Even before my family of four became minivan lovers, the Nissan Quest, which was redesigned for the 2011 model year, caught my eye with its boxy exterior, sleek wrap-around rear windows and bold styling.\n\nThe 2012 Nissan Quest embraces its minivan ways by not blending in to the world of rounded crossovers and minivans.\n\nThis family-hauler seats seven and has a surprising amount of power for a mom-mobile. It has a 260-horsepower V-6 engine that’s paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission. It offered a smooth ride whether I was toting my brood off to preschool or merging onto the freeway.\n\nThanks to its luxurious leather- and faux-wood-trimmed interior, I was the envy of the drop-off lane. While that last part might be slightly imagined on my part, the Quest’s interior is right up there with any luxury cars I’ve driven. That’s unexpected in this family-friendly segment that’s geared toward juice boxes and Goldfish crackers.\n\nThe 2012 Quest S base model has a starting MSRP of $25,990, but the top-of-the-line LE that I tested had a sticker price of $41,350.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhile it took me a while to jump on the minivan bandwagon, the edgy Quest was the first one I could picture myself driving. It has just enough style and quirk to it to make it stand out.\n\nThere is no denying the Quest is a minivan, but I’ve embraced the dual power-sliding rear doors that open with the push of a button. The minivan’s step-in height is the perfect compromise between a sedan and an SUV. My preschooler could easily climb in, and buckling up my toddler didn’t send my back into spasms.\n\nAfter loading groceries into the cargo area, I was thankful to find that the higher-level trims, SL and LE, come with a standard one-touch power liftgate. The cargo area is split into two levels, with a deep under-floor storage bin. This is handy if there are a few must-have items that you always keep in the cargo area but don’t want them squashed by groceries or a stroller. However, I found that accessing or loading anything into that lower storage bin to be somewhat frustrating since the cover doesn’t stay open on its own. Other than that minor issue, I appreciated the size and versatility of the cargo area. Both the second row’s captain’s chairs and third-row bench seat fold flat to create a flat cargo floor, leaving the deep storage well for additional items.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Quest comes with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 260 hp. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/24 mpg city/highway. With gas prices climbing, it was a relief to learn that the Quest only requires regular fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Quest’s interior looks luxurious, especially for a vehicle that can fit four munchkins in child-safety seats.\n\nWith gleaming faux wood trim and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, there was a noticeable lack of utilitarian-looking plastic trim in the Quest. I appreciated the niceties, but by the end of my test drive the trim showed every fingerprint and lots of dust. Maybe there’s a method to the utilitarian plastic madness used in other family cars.\n\nThe Quest LE came equipped with standard leather seating and an easy-to-use touch-screen with navigation and a backup camera. It also had a standard rear entertainment system with two sets of wireless headphones for my little ones.\n\nMy family of four had enough legroom to spread out in the Quest — even with a second row full of child-safety seats. The second row’s captain chair’s slide forward and back to create more legroom where it’s needed. For any adult sitting in the third row, they’ll want the second-row occupants to share the legroom wealth as the third row is lacking in that regard.\n\nThe Quest’s storage was sufficient, but it didn’t knock my socks off as other minivans have. While it had a fair amount of cubbies, one of the main storage compartments — a low console between the second row’s captain’s chairs — needs to be removed to access the third row. This is only necessary if you have child-safety seats in the captain’s chairs, which makes it difficult to slide them out of the way. That’s disappointing considering that most people interested in a minivan are going to want to access that third row easily and often. The storage console is easily removed; however, doing so also removes two cupholders. I must note that even without said cupholders there’s still more than enough cup- and bottleholders to go around.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Quest has received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the second-best score of Acceptable in the roof-strength crash test. The Quest hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are three sets of lower Latch anchors in the 2012 Quest, with two sets in the second row and a third set in the third row. All three sets are difficult to use because they’re buried between the back and bottom seat cushions. Both my rear- and forward-facing car seats fit well in the second row. My husband and I also were able to fit our forward-facing convertible in the third row. A booster seat would easily fit into any of the rear seats.\n\nThe 2012 Quest LE has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a backup camera, a blind spot monitoring system, active front head restraints, an electronic stability system with traction control, and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Nissan Quest here.",

      "expert_review": "My last experience driving the Nissan Quest yielded a mixed review. I drove a stripped-down base model in 2004. For 2005 Nissan is providing me with a loaded midline version for comparison. I can’t wait to discover if I can be “bought” with the extras. Surely I’ll see through the glitz and glamour of high-cost accessories and interpret the car for what it is. On second thought, I am a woman after all; a bit of bling will inevitably catch my eye.\n\nThe design of the Quest hasn’t changed since last year, and that’s a good thing. The new age concept for the center console has grown on me since the last time I drove it. It still looks pretty bizarre (and makes it difficult to find the CD slot without bending over to sneak a peak), but at least Nissan is stepping outside of the box. I drive car after car that all blend together from a lack of design innovation. Driving the Quest is like venturing out for Sunday brunch after eating corn flakes all week.\n\nThe driver’s seat adjusts automatically in the SL version (as opposed to manually in the S model) and features power adjustable foot pedals. Just watch your pressure on the gas pedal, so you don’t have to keep looking down and over to find the speedometer on the dash between the driver and the passenger.\n\nOne of the coolest features of the Quest I discover while I’m driving at night. When activating my turn signal, the “cornering light” illuminates the street and corner that I’m planning to turn onto allowing me to see where I’m about to go. This is great for me since my night vision has exponentially declined through two pregnancies (or maybe I’m just getting older. Naw, I think I’ll stick to the pregnancy excuse).\n\nI’m thrilled to discover that my test vehicle has automatic doors and tailgate. Did I say doors? I meant door. For some strange reason, only the right door is automatic on the SL model. I’d have to upgrade to the SE version for two automatic doors.\n\nWhy is the right side more important than the left? My older daughter enters and exits on the right side in carpool lane, so the automatic door comes in handy there (as does the handle at just the right height to help her climb in and out on her own). But my 2-year-old, who stays with me all day, is loaded in on the left side. When I run my usual errands to the grocery store, the dry cleaners and the coffee shop I have to manually open the door each and every time to load, and subsequently unload, the baby. Big whoop, you say? Well, having the auto door on one side makes the manual door on the other seem much more arduous.\n\nThe Nissan Quest is loaded to the brim with storage compartments. The two mesh pockets and extra hooks behind the driver and passenger’s seats are perfect for storing activities or emergency diapers. The molded bottle holders in the sliding doors stash a roll of paper towel for messy clean-ups. Also, the “high-capacity” dry cleaning hooks keep hanging clothes out of the way of back seat passengers.\n\nI’d like to see Nissan simplify the process for folding both the second and third row seats on the Quest. The steps are neither self explanatory nor adequately labeled on the seats themselves. This has me referring to the quick guide. I have enough on my plate as it is, so the last thing I want to do is dig out the manual for something as basic as seat folding.\n\nThe Nissan Quest has certainly grown on me since the first time I drove it nearly a year ago. Its space age design takes some getting used to, but proves to be comfortable and mostly functional for everyone in the car.\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Quest and its safety features visit Cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Nissan hasn’t changed much about the Quest minivan since I last reviewed it in 2012. In that review, the Quest’s third row was just a novelty for my brood. As a family of four, the Quest was perfect for us; it was luxurious and had all the technology and safety perks a family could want. However, with the addition of baby No. 3 to my family, the Quest’s third row went from nice-to-have to must-have.\n\nUnfortunately, the third row’s narrow seats moved the 2013 Nissan Quest down a few notches on my list of favorite minivans. Trust me, as a mom of three small children, there’s a list.\n\nDespite my frustrations with the third row, I still enjoyed the 2013 Quest. It’s quirky but sleek exterior allowed me to hold my head up high — even when I pulled up next to the cool family that’s still squeezing their kids into a Mini Cooper. Also, Nissan has one of my favorite safety features, the Around View Monitor, which offers a bird’s-eye view of the minivan’s exterior.\n\nWithout question, the seven-seat Quest is my favorite minivan to drive. Not only does it glide over bumps in the road, but it has more than enough power with its 3.5-liter V-6 engine to pull its weight — even when packed to the gills with children and child-safety seats.\n\nThe 2013 Nissan Quest S base model is going to set you back $26,835, including an $845 destination charge. My test car was the top-of-the-line LE trim. With the bump in features also comes a bump in price to $42,460. While it may seem like a pretty penny for a minivan, the Quest’s price is in line with its competitors. \n   \nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 Quest keeps its boxy shape; the look debuted with its 2011 redesign. The funky exterior is polarizing; people either love it or hate it. Thankfully I am one of those that love its distinctive rocket-ship-like design. While there is no disguising that it’s a people-mover, it is one of the most luxurious-looking minivans on the market.\n\n\n\nThe more I test-drive family-friendly minivans, the more I love them. All of the Quest’s trim levels except the base S have dual power sliding doors. Being able to open the sliding doors with a push of a button and have two out of my three kids climb into their child-safety seats without a nudge or a lift from me puts a smile on my face. The one-touch power liftgate, which comes standard on the SL and LE trims, is another feature I don’t want to live without.\n\nUnlike its competitors, the Quest’s second- and third-row seats fold flat, creating a continuous load floor. There’s also a deep well behind the third-row seats that can be used even when the seats are folded. Behind the third row, there’s 25.7 cubic feet of space. When the third-row seats are folded, there’s 63.6 cubic feet. Fold the second row and there’s 108.4 cubic feet. It sounds impressive, but that’s less cargo space than its competitors. The Toyota Sienna wins the minivan space race with 150.0 cubic feet when all seats are folded and 39.1 cubic feet when all seats are in use.\n\nThe 2013 Quest has a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/25 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gasoline. During my weeklong test drive of mostly city driving, I averaged 18 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent   \nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Nissan Quest LE has an interior quality that is on par with those found in its luxury sibling, Infiniti. The spa-like leather seats and chrome accents on the dash helped me almost forget that I had chicken nugget boxes and fruit-snack wrappers under my feet. Almost.\n\nNissan deserves major kudos for its intuitive navigation and audio systems. I especially liked the way the large, easy-to-read buttons were laid out.\n\nWith three rows of seats, my family of five had plenty of room. Even with three child-safety seats, including one rear-facing car seat, we weren’t begging for more legroom, which is quite a feat. However, the second- and third-row seats seem to sit slightly lower than in other minivans. The second row has two captain’s chairs and a removable center console, and the third row has three seating positions.\n\nTo help keep the kiddos happy, the Quest LE has standard manual side-window sunshades for the second and third rows. This was great for my older daughters, who have recently become little vampires, writhing in pain whenever the sun hits their faces. Unfortunately, the shades aren’t offered on lower trim levels. A DVD entertainment system with two wireless headphones was standard on the LE and available on the SE and SV trims.\n\nWhile I appreciate the Quest’s luxury offerings, there are a few little luxuries that need some tweaking. The first is the too-small conversation mirror. Other than confirming that yes, my passengers haven’t jumped ship, it’s too small to see whether my littlest passengers are awake or even if they’re still buckled up — let alone converse with them. The second is the Quest’s storage bins — both size and quantity. For a minivan, they need to be bigger and there needs to be more of them.       \nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nNissan’s Around View Monitor, which is standard on the Quest LE, is a huge step up from a backup camera. With the click of a button, you can see all around your car on one screen. This comes in handy when parallel parking or when backing out of a driveway that has lots of kids and their various paraphernalia nearby. Instead of just noticing when little Timmy is smack dab behind your minivan, you can see him as he is running alongside of it — before he runs behind it to fetch his ball.\n\nThe 2013 Quest also has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, a blind spot warning system and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows.\n\nThere are three sets of lower Latch anchors in the 2013 Quest, with two sets in the second row’s captain’s chairs and a third set in the third row. Both our forward- and rear-facing child-safety seats fit well in the second row and didn’t take up the front passenger’s legroom. My preschooler is in a booster seat, so we set her up in the third row. Unfortunately, the seats were too narrow and her booster covered up the seat belt buckle, leaving us to reach over the second row and scoot her booster seat over to buckle (and unbuckle) her every time. That got old real quick. Find out how the Quest performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nIn crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Quest received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear tests. It earned the second highest score of Acceptable in the roof-strength test, and it hasn’t been undergone IIHS’ latest small overlap crash test, which simulates a car’s front corner hitting a tree or a pole. The 2013 Quest hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffics Safety Administration.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Nissan Quest.",

      "expert_review": "Welcome to the limovan, the 2000 Nissan Quest SE.\n\nTechnically, it’s a minivan that’s classified as a truck, which makes no sense at all.\n\nThere is nothing truck-like about the thing. And other than its shape, there’s not much “minivan” about it, either.\n\nIt’s three-fourths limousine, one-fourth van. Step inside. You’ll see what I mean.\n\nThere are leather seats and nice carpeting, of course. But you’ll notice that the interior space, though ample, is not as large as that found in a standard minivan, such as a Dodge Caravan or Toyota Sienna. The dimensions are smaller, akin to those of a luxury car.\n\nThe feel is that of a rich sedan, too. The leather seats are perforated, allowing them to breathe. That makes them more comfortable in hot and cold weather. Chrome covers the interior door handles for an additional touch of elegance.\n\nStandard onboard info-tainment systems in the Quest SE include sound and video &#151; a seven-speaker, 130-watt AM-FM radio, cassette and CD player, as well as a videocassette player with a 6.4-inch screen mounted in the center console.\n\nIn all, there are seven cup holders and 31 storage spaces within the Quest SE. There are two illuminated visor vanity mirrors, power windows and locks with illuminated switches, and a remote keyless entry system that illuminates the interior when activated. You can install a phone and fax transceiver, as well as other electronic goodies, if you wish.\n\nNeat stuff. But it leaves me feeling weird.\n\nIt’s an AWE (Acute Wealth Effect) problem, a shocking disconnect between the excesses of the moment and the practicality of the past.\n\nThis is supposed to be a utility vehicle, a simple hauler of people and cargo. That was the case with the first minivans, those produced by Chrysler Corp. in 1984. Those early vans were elongated boxes on wheels, designed to carry up to seven people and their baggage. Families bought them. Moms drove them. They were soccer buses, troop carriers, surrogate station wagons. They also were affordable, which means they weren’t about image.\n\nBut image sells, especially in a society where few people want to be ordinary and in an economy where many can afford to be different. That’s why we’re getting so many crossover vehicles &#151; pickup trucks with sedan doors and seating, sport-utility vehicles that look like expensive station wagons, and expensive station wagons that function like sport-utility vehicles. It’s a very short distance from there to the minivan as limo.\n\nNone of this is to say that the 2000 Quest SE totally lacks practical value. Like its structural and mechanical twin, the Mercury Villager, it has one of the most useful cargo floors of any minivan, large or small. Credit the Quest Trac Flexible Seating System, which allows the easy movement and rearrangement of middle and rear seats to create ample carrying room.\n\nThere is an optional Quest Smart Shelf, which can be reconfigured to carry baby strollers and other items. You can also outfit the Quest to pull a trailer weighing 3,500 pounds, which should give you enough space to bring a butler and kitchen staff.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Nissan Quest SE Complaints: Interior space gets tight with seven occupants. Also, federal crash-test scores rank the Quest below several rivals in its ability to withstand offset frontal collisions (angled hits behind the front fenders).\n\nPraise: With five or fewer occupants, the front-wheel-drive Quest becomes a comfortable, enjoyable, posh highway cruiser. There is no such thing as a boring trip in this one.\n\nHead-turning quotient: As is the case with its twin, the Mercury Villager, the Quest is one of the best-looking minivans on the market, especially with two-tone paint.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Everything about the way it moves and handl es says la rge family sedan. There’s nothing trucky about it. Acceleration is surprisingly good.\n\nEngine: All 2000 Quest models (base GXE, SE cloth, SE leather and top-of-the-line GLE) are equipped with a 3.3-liter, single-overhead-cam V-6 designed to produce 170 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 200 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 rpm. The engine is mated to a standard electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission that exhibits very little downshifting on uphill grades.\n\nMileage: About 20 miles per gallon in city-highway driving. Runs fine on regular unleaded gasoline. Holds 20 gallons of fuel.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested 2000 Quest SE leather is $26,699, with a dealer invoice price of $23,994. Price as tested is $28,806, including $1,587 in options and a $520 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Mercury Villager.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Nissan Quest hits the market after taking 2010 off. Nissan clearly took that year off to do some serious examination of what the minivan lacked and what it could do better to be a real contender in the market. The result is a 2011 Quest with a unique exterior and an upscale interior that combine to make this a minivan that could give the outstanding Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna a run for their money.\n\nThis is an all-new Quest, and it’s not just the outside that’s gotten a spicy new look; the interior has also been restyled and verges on downright fancy with its faux-wood and metal-looking accents.\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect and driving the Quest wasn’t as exciting as its new looks. While the driving experience wasn’t wholly inspiring, the Quest’s V-6 was quite competent in tackling the curvy, steep roads through the Rocky Mountains for a trek to Breckenridge, Colo. However, it seemed to labor more than necessary when cruising city streets.\n\nThe Quest has a starting MSRP of $27,750. The model I tested, the SV, starts at $30,900, but with the addition of roof rails, floormats and a cargo net, the price came to $32,240.\n\nEXTERIOR\nAutomakers have been trying to spice up minivans recently. There isn’t a whole lot one can do with the form of a minivan in order to preserve its function. That said, the 2011 Nissan Quest actually does a decent job of mixing up its exterior looks, especially compared to previous years. It looks like the love child of a Ford Flex and a previous-generation Nissan Quest. This alleged coupling produced a car whose looks may not be for everyone, but they definitely stand out in the minivan crowd.\n\nThe 2011 Quest is shorter than its predecessor, putting it at almost the same length as a Sienna and just a couple inches shy of an Odyssey. It’s also got a few tweaks to give it an edgier look. The windows are now tinted, the pillars on the sides and rear are black and the roof sits atop these pillars, giving it that Flex-like floating-roof appearance. The new grille and door handles are chrome, and there is a spoiler at the rear. My test car was the midlevel SV trim. It came with standard 16-inch aluminum alloy wheels. Upper-level trims come with 18-inch wheels.\n\nA power moonroof, power liftgate and one-touch power sliding doors are all available features to make any family’s life in the Quest more pleasant. My test car did not come with any of these features, but one-touch doors that automatically unlock and slide open after you’ve swiped your hand over a button on the exterior door handle sound brilliant.\n\nThe rear cargo space includes a 60/40-split covered storage well that brings the total cargo space behind the third row up to 37.1 cubic feet, which is on par with that of the Sienna and Odyssey. The 2011 Quest does fall short in overall storage capacity with 108.4 cubic feet of total volume; the Sienna and the Odyssey each have almost 150 cubic feet. Of course, if you have children in child-safety seats like I do, total cargo volume isn’t as important since your kids are always strapped into their car seats, and the seats are not going to be folded down anytime soon.\n\nThe 2011 Nissan Quest has a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that produces 260 horsepower; it’s paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission. During my weeklong test drive, I could hear each and every one of those horses working. The Quest gets an EPA-estimated 19/24 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Quest’s redesigned interior is easy on the eyes. The interior’s faux-metal and wood-like trims evoke images of Nissan’s luxurious Infiniti brand and create a warm feeling throughout the Quest’s cabin. The center stack is intuitive to use, and while my test car did not have it, a rear entertainment system is available with an impressively large 11-inch flip-down screen.\n\nThe seats are comfortable, even for longer rides, and the fabric upholstery, though not beautifully patterned, was super easy to clean. How do I know this, you ask? Well, it’s like this: During my test drive, it was the beginning of cherry season here in the Rocky Mountains. My children are bananas for cherries, so I couldn’t keep them from eating cherries in the car. A cherry or five found refuge on the upholstery and left a mark or two, which came off easily (even after a few days!) with the quick swipe of a baby wipe. I was amazed. Leather upholstery is also available.\n\nThe number and variety of cupholders and cubbies also make the 2011 Quest family-friendly. There are 16 cupholders, a clever cubby near the center stack that is perfect for a smartphone or iPod, and several other cubbies located throughout the car that are useful for storing books, toys and snacks. There are also two great little hooks positioned on the back of the driver and front passenger seats. These hooks could be used for something expected like dry cleaning, but my children quickly decided these hooks were the ideal spot for their backpacks and lunch boxes. They had easy access to their stuff for every car ride.\n\nMy only real issue with the Quest’s interior is the removable console in the second row. It is not easy to remove and ended up becoming more of a step stool into the third. With child-safety seats installed in the second-row captain’s chairs, going over that center console was the only option for getting to the third row as it’s too much of a hassle to take it out and reinstall it every time you get the kids in and out of the car. The console itself offers adequate space for drinks and snacks, but I would prefer a clear path to the third row and another solution for refreshments.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Nissan Quest scored the highest rating of Good in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It hasn’t undergone IIHS’ roof-strength or rear crash tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t crash-tested the 2011 Quest.\n\nThe Quest is filled with the usual array of standard safety equipment — antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control and six airbags — to ensure that you and your precious cargo are protected. The Quest also has standard front-wheel drive and active head restraints in the front row. One standout standard feature is the tire pressure monitoring system with Easy Fill Tire Alert, which flashes the car’s hazard lights when a tire is being filled with air and then sounds the horn when the tire has reached its required pressure. While I didn’t have occasion to put this feature to use, the mere idea of ending the guessing game when inflating car tires made me giddy. A blind spot warning system is another cool safety feature, but if you want that, you’ll have to pay extra.\n\nThe Quest has three sets of lower Latch anchors — two sets in the second row’s captain’s chairs and the third set in the third row. The anchors’ accessibility and ease of use are average; they didn’t cause me to break a nail or a sweat, but I’ve seen better. A rear-facing infant-safety seat, convertible car seat and a booster seat all fit well in the Quest.

      "expert_review": "As a mama of two energized boys, I am continuously pressed for stuff to do. I scour the papers and surf the web. I even go so far as to engage perfect strangers in lengthy chatter in an ongoing attempt to uncover fabulous activities, clandestine playgrounds and other brilliant endeavors to surprise my children with. Any suggestion is embraced with extraordinary care, as I consider its viability and potential success ratio (based on an intricate formula comprised of MI=HO² – Mommy Input = Happy Output²). At times, this quest for adventure can be downright taxing. Having recently overindulged my kids, I find solace in the 2007 Nissan Quest. This vehicle is so exceptional on its own that I can finally put adventure seeking (and formula pondering) to rest.\n\nThe kids LOVE this van, and, for me, driving around in the Quest is an activity in itself. I entertain my kids with a fold-down DVD screen (wireless headsets included) that – unlike those in most vehicles I’ve tested – doesn’t impair my view out the rear window at all. My kids hide their various accessories in the ample storage space provided in the second and third rows. To me, compartment space is an absolute necessity with kids, and there’s no shortage of it in the Quest. I can easily organize a litany of art kits, coloring books, toy cars, sippy cups and snacks. In front of the spacious center console, I come across the best cupholders I’ve ever seen. I can actually house my tall latte just as snuggly as my one-liter Nalgene bottle. Right below the cupholders I also have access to two crafty little storage bins, one of which doubles as a sunglass holder.\n\nThe automatic sliding doors on either side of the vehicle are noteworthy attention grabbers. My kids can’t seem to get to them fast enough (leaving the house has never been so easy). Additionally, the low step-in height has them literally running right into the Quest. Speaking of rapid movement, while we’re stopped in the Quest waiting to meet a friend, my kids playfully move between the captain’s chairs in the second row and laughingly throw themselves into the third row. A new game has been invented!\n\nOn a safety note, I applaud Nissan for outfitting all three rows of seats with curtain airbags, which are especially crucial due to the appeal of the “way back” these days. I, myself, scoot into the third row, curious as to how well an adult will fit, and I’m pleased to report that I am surprisingly comfortable, which is not something I can say of many third rows. Now I understand why my kids clamor to get back there, and admit I’d be perfectly happy daydreaming out the fantastic paneled glass roof, sipping an ice-cold drink, a bag of cheddar bunnies in the storage bin next to me, occasionally glancing at the DVD screen to see what’s playing.\n\nWhat’s not to love? Everything about it beats the way we used to travel as kids, when all five of us (or more, depending on who was visiting at any given moment) were crammed into a big old station wagon. As underlings we were rotated in and out of the cargo hold, subjected to Sahara Desert-like temperatures in the summers. The Quest, on the other hand, features a rear temperature control to ensure my children are always kept at a happy temperature.\n\nThe only gripe I have about the rear is that the third row doesn’t split. It’s an all-or-nothing proposition: third row up or third row down. Plus, the Nissan’s navigation system is cumbersome to use. In order to input two cross streets, I have to use a joystick-like thing to highlight letters at a snail’s pace.\n\nLast but not least, a lovable feature I come across in the Quest is the memo pad function (accessed through the voice recognition system) that enables me to record my to-do list while motoring along. I appreciatively dictate grocery list forget-me-nots while taking care of school carpool. Additionally, the clever lounge-chair-like adjustable armrest and the seat heater add to my comfort while passing the time.\n\nThe 2007 Nissan Quest is a sure hit for family affairs, as comfort, style and function meet to keep the family fun factor at an all-time high.\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Quest and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLatch Connectors: 3 (2 in the second row, 1 in the center of the third)\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample – Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair (with the third row up)\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Good Times\n\nSpecs\n\nBase price: $27,500\n\nPrice as tested: $39,515\n\nEngine: 235-hp, 3.5-liter V-6\n\nFuel: 18/25 mpg\n\nLength: 204.1″\n\nWidth: 77.6″\n\nGround Clearance: 5.8″\n\nTurning Radius: 20.0′\n\nCargo space: 145.7 cu. ft.\n\nNHTSA Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal Impact\n\nDriver’s side: 5 Stars\n\nPassenger’s side: 5 Stars\n\nSide Impact\n\nFront occupant: 5 Stars\n\nRear occupant: 5 Stars\n\nRollover resistance: 4 Stars",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntended to stand apart from the minivan pack, a redesigned Quest went on sale as a 2004 model and was produced at a new plant in Mississippi.\n\nFor 2006, 3.5 SL and 3.5 SE Quests can be fitted with Michelin run-flat tires, which can be driven up to 125 miles when flat. A new 3.5 S Special Edition model — which features a power liftgate, an in-dash six-CD changer, rear sonar park-assist system and Special Edition badges — is offered. XM or Sirius Satellite Radio is available.\n\nExterior\nThe Quest’s styling is considerably more curvaceous and imaginative than most minivans’. The belt line sweeps downward toward the front, and the arching roofline adds a certain flair. The door handles, mirrors and side moldings are body colored. Heated mirrors with puddle lamps are available, and fog lamps are offered.\n\nThe Quest rides on a long, 124-inch wheelbase. Built with a fully independent suspension, the Quest shares its basic platform with the company’s Altima, Maxima and Murano models.\n\nInterior\nA “tip-up” feature on the second-row seat helps ease entry into the third row. The instruments are mounted high in the center of the dashboard. The shift lever extends from the instrument panel.\n\nThe Quest can seat up to seven occupants, and the third-row seat folds into a recess in the floor. The second-row seats fold and drop forward. A 150-watt CD stereo is installed. A DVD entertainment system with either one or two roof-mounted screens and a four-panel rear Skyview roof with a full-length rear overhead console are optional. For 2006, 3.5 SL and 3.5 SE models have a front, folding center tray with cupholders as standard equipment.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Quest’s 3.5-liter V-6 generates 240 horsepower and 242 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed-automatic transmission goes into 3.5 and 3.5 S Special Edition models, while other models use a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes incorporate brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution, and standard side curtain-type airbags protect occupants in all three rows of seats. Traction control is standard, and Nissan’s Vehicle Dynamic Control electronic stability system is standard on the 3.5 SE.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPossessing styling and performance traits all its own, the Quest is full of pleasant surprises. You get an agreeable ride and handling qualities in this minivan. Though body lean in curves isn’t absent and wavy road surfaces are noticeable, the Quest is tightly controlled and recovers smartly. Ordinary imperfections are significantly softened, but larger bumps can yield big bangs from the suspension.\n\nThe Quest is highly stable and secure on the highway, and it has a distinctly sporty steering feel. Energetic response is coupled with outstanding transmission reactions in the 3.5 SE.\n\nEven though the center-mounted tachometer and speedometer are fairly easy to get used to, these gauges are a little hard to see at a glance. Windshield glare can be troublesome, and the climate controls are less than intuitive. The optional Skyview roof panes add a bit of brightness to the interior.",
