      "expert_review": "Armada’s brute power blows competition away\n\nToyota Motor Co.p. was the first Japanese brand to challenge Detroit in the full-size sport-ute arena. Now, two years after the arrival of Toyota’s Sequoia, a second Japanese contender, the Pathfinder Armada, has been launched by Nissan Motor Co., and it finally seems like the Japanese mean business.\n\nThe 2004 Pathfinder Armada, much like its sister vehicle, the 2004 Titan pickup, is the first serious attempt to crack Detroit’s stranglehold in the full-size truck market.\n\nThe Sequoia, as good as it is, always seemed like a middle linebacker on a diet, somewhat underequipped to be playing with the pros. Not so the Pathfinder Armada, which is the second vehicle to roll out of Nissan’s new $1.4-billion plant in Canton, Miss.\n\nThe Armada — even its name sounds formidable — looks and acts the role of spoiler. It shares the Titan’s aggressive front-end styling and a tough-guy attitude that carries through the muscular side profile all the way to the bold rear-end graphic.\n\nNissan backs that up with a sturdy ladder-type frame that supports a fully independent suspension, with double wishbones and coil springs at all four corners. The result is a solid truck-like ride that absorbs man-size potholes on the freeways of Detroit while still providing reasonably good ride comfort, and brisk, controlled handling in most situations. Helping with the compliant ride are a generous 123.2-inch wheelbase — the longest in the segment — and standard 18-inch wheels and tires.\n\nI didn't get a chance to take the Armada off the highway, but then most SUV buyers rarely do either. \n\nBut it’s good to know the big Nissan SUV has a towing capacity of more than 9,000 pounds, which makes it fully-competitive with popular Detroit iron in this class, including the Ford Expedition and the Chevrolet Tahoe.\n\nIn fact, the Armada handily outguns its domestic rivals in the power department.\n\nThe base Expedition ($32,885 including destination) is fitted with a single-overhead-cam 4.6-liter V-8 that makes 232 horsepower and 291 pounds-feet of torque. An SOHC 5.4-liter V-8 is an extra-cost option. The base Tahoe ($34,955) comes with an overhead-valve 4.8-liter V-8 that produces 275 horsepower and 290 pounds-feet. An OHV 5.3-liter V-8 is available for an additional charge.\n\nThe Armada blows both away. The only available engine in model year 2004 is a double-overhead-cam 5.6-liter V-8, a monster block that is borrowed from the Titan and in this particular application churns out 305 horsepower and 385 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nDespite Armada’s two-and-a-half-ton mass, the big V-8 is more than up to the task. Acceleration is brisk, and the engine responds willingly to the slightest throttle provocation.\n\nAll is not roses, however. The two-wheel-drive edition of the Armada is rated by the EPA at a middling 13 miles per gallon in city driving and 19 mpg on the highway; the 4×4 model surrenders one mpg in highway driving. Even with the standard 28-gallon fuel tank, you’re likely to find yourself filling up frequently on long trips — an undesireable trait that Armada shares with its equally thirsty Detroit rivals.\n\nWe can forgive the mediocre fuel economy in part because Nissan has lavished so much attention on turning the Armada’s cabin into a safe and inviting environment for family and friends.\n\nThe vehicle can seat up to eight. Both the second- and third-row benches fold flat for more cargo space.\n\nOutside of a massive plasticky center stack that houses the audio and climate controls and screams Japanese kitsch, the Armada is pretty tastefully outfitted.\n\nThe base SE series comes with cloth seats; leather is standard on the LE and optional on the SE.\n\nOther options include a satellite na igation system on LE models; a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, with a single overhead display and two sets of wireless headphones; and a premium Bose audio system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer, 10 speakers and redundant steering-wheel controls.\n\nThe Armada has been thoughtfully equipped with ample safety features. Among the standard items are four-wheel disc brakes with antilock, brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution; electronic stability and traction control; side air curtains for all three rows, and a tire-pressure monitor. Seat-mounted side air bags for front occupants are standard on LE and optional on SE.\n\nAmong the competition, the Expedition was heavily revised a year ago, while Tahoe and Sequoia won’t be overhauled for at least two to three more years. Armada then is not only the newest and freshest kid on the block, it’s also — for the moment anyway — the spunkiest.",

      "expert_review": "Winding paths and trails suddenly have been straightened out a bit with Nissan’s new 1996 Pathfinder sport/utility vehicle.\n\nFiguring that there’s nothing wrong with making a good thing bigger and better, designers have given the Pathfinder a bored-out V-6 engine, a longer wheelbase and an extra 2.2 inches in width.\n\nAdd a redesigned interior that was created at Nissan Design International in La Jolla (pronounced la-hoy-ya), Calif., and you have a four-door, five- passenger vehicle that is almost as much a car as a sport/utility.\n\nOffered in XE, SE and upscale LE form, the price of four-wheel drive models starts in the mid-$25,000 range for the base and ends a touch more than $32,000 for the LE.\n\nEven though the four-wheel drive option increases the price by $2,000, it is the preferred sales package.\n\n“We mainly sell four-wheel drive,” said Tim Torrance, sales manager for Collins Nissan. “I’d say it’s due to the climate. The extra $2,000 doesn’t seem to have too much of an effect.”\n\nThe new Pathfinder’s wheelbase is 2.0 inches longer (106.3 inches) than that of its predecessor, and its body has been stretched 6.7 inches — to 178.3 inches overall length.\n\nThe vehicle has been designed to offer more passenger comfort and convenience, plus added cargo space. The convenience factor has been handled by moving back the rear wheels 2 inches. This has greatly enhanced access to the rear seats.\n\nBy going up in size, it gave exterior stylists a bit more freedom to execute a more aerodynamic look, while blending in familiar Pathfinder styling.\n\nThe A-pillar design has been shaped to eliminate wind noise and control rain flow. Integrated gutters help keep rain off the side windows, and a special triple door seal like that used on the new Maxima provides better noise insulation.\n\nIf you build a sports/utility that feels like a car, then obviously you have to impart car-like features to the vehicle’s controls and accessories.\n\nThe driver’s cockpit layout is straight out of Nissan’s automobile offerings. While the folks in La Jolla gave the instrument and console panels individualistic Nissan styling, it still is state-of-the-art, featuring bucket seats divided by a center console that holds the gearshift levers.\n\nSpecial attention has been given to the front bucket seats, which are similar to those used in the Nissan Maxima. They contain fatigue-reducing foam construction that provides added comfort on longer drives.\n\nA 60/40 split rear seat, which also is a state-of-the-art concept, folds flat for added cargo flexibility.\n\nThe instrumentation consists of a speedometer, tachometer, temperature and fuel gauges, plus an odometer. Considering that a five-speed manual transmission is offered (as well as a four-speed automatic), I sure wouldn’t mind an oil pressure gauge.\n\nThe new Pathfinder ought to be as strong as a bridge. The base of the vehicle is an all-new MonoFrame uni-body which has 2.3 times the bending stiffness and almost three times the torsional rigidity as the previous design.\n\nThis stiff, integrated body platform provides the best foundation for the new strut-type front suspension, which replaces the previous wishbone design. Shocks and springs have been placed further outboard to give the sport/utility sedan-like stability.\n\nNissan had on hand a 3.0-liter, single overhead cam V-6 engine, and it probably would have been cheaper and easier just to bore a bigger hole in the cylinders to go out to 3.3 liters. Rather than compromise the cylinder wall thickness, a new wider block was cast to accommodate a bigger bore and new pistons.\n\nWith the addition of a new camshaft profile, power now reads 168-horsepower and 196 foot-pounds of torque. That doesn’t make a drag machine out of the vehicle, but it still accounts for a 110 mph top speed and a 0-60 mph time of 11.2 seconds in four- wheel drive. You can knock off morethan a second for 0-60 mph in two-wheel drive.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNissans midsize sport utility vehicle received a new, substantially more powerful 240-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine for introduction as an early 2001 model. A fresh grille with a larger, restyled Nissan badge goes on 2002 models, which come with new 16- and 17-inch aluminum wheels. The SE edition features new titanium-accented step rails, a roof rack with an integrated air dam, new body-colored bumpers and fender flares, and a redesigned cloth interior. The steering wheel has been restyled, and the six-disc CD changer is said to function more rapidly.\n\nBuilt from the same design as the Infiniti QX4, the Pathfinder has fewer amenities and an appreciably lower sticker price. Nissan also sells the Xterra, which is based on the Frontier pickup and priced below the Pathfinder.\n\nExterior\nThough it displays a typical SUV appearance overall, the Pathfinder has a neatly tapered rear end. It has a 106.3-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 182.7 inches  5 inches longer than the Xterra. Standing about 68 inches tall, the Pathfinder measures close to 70 inches wide and has four side doors. The rear liftgate has a window that flips up.\n\nInterior\nAll Pathfinders seat five, though foot room for backseat occupants might be tight beneath the front seats. Instrument clusters in the XE and LE models have black markings on a white background, in contrast to the SEs gauges, which have a titanium background and colors that reverse at night. Large, convenient controls operate the climate and audio systems. Optional duplicate audio controls on the steering wheel include an on-off switch. A 60/40-split rear seat folds to create 85 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nUnder the Hood\nOne engine, two transmissions and two drive systems are available for the Pathfinder. The 3.5-liter V-6 engine develops 240 hp in the automatic and an additional 10 hp with a manual shift. The Pathfinder SE has a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission; XE and LE models come only with the automatic gearbox.\n\nThe Pathfinder can have rear-wheel drive or a part-time four-wheel-drive system, which is intended for use on slippery surfaces. The 4WD system can be engaged or disengaged at up to 50 mph by using a floor-mounted transfer-case lever. The Pathfinder LE 4×4 has a push-button All-Mode 4WD system that permits up to 50 percent of available torque to reach the front wheels when needed.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are part of an optional leather package for the LE and SE models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Pathfinder is a mighty smooth operator  a true pleasure to drive and ride in, delivering plenty of performance to boot. Ride quality reaches close to gentle, and it gets choppy only on washboard surfaces. Despite the soft ride, handling ranks above average as the Pathfinder maneuvers easily and adeptly, staying relatively flat in curves and corners. Little or no correction is needed on straightaways. An easy-acting automatic transmission delivers prompt gear changes.\n\nSeats are comfortable and supportive. The backseat is as inviting as the front seat, with fine legroom, if not quite as much headroom. In short, the Pathfinder is very carlike, in the best sense of the word, and actually smoother-riding than the related Infiniti QX4.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "That car hikers simply roll them off the delivery truck into the hands of waiting buyers. Forget any detour to the showroom.\n\nThat, of course, must mean rival vehicles from Japan such as the Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder and Isuzu Trooper are gathering dust in some distant corner.\n\nYou’d think so, based on the fact that the rising value of the yen against the dollar has boosted Japanese vehicle prices to the point that it doesn’t hurt to inhale deeply from the smelling salts before focusing on the window sticker.\n\nBut it’s not the case. All sport-utility vehicles are doing well, and whilethere are domestic loyalists, there are import fans, too. Such is the case with the Nissan Pathfinder-or, as the local Ford ad calls it, the “Sneeze-on Pathgrinder.”\n\nSales, when last we looked, were up 50 percent from a year earlier. What makes that a bit surprising is that in the world of sport-utility vehicles, Pathfinder isn’t exactly what you’d call a pathfinder. Except for a little cosmetic touchup, the Pathfinder has basically gone unchanged since it bowed in this country in 1986.\n\nWe test-drove the four-door, four-wheel-drive SE version with a 3-liter V-6engine and automatic transmission. The Pathfinder has only been offered in a four-door model since 1990. That’s when the U.S. government determined that two-door Pathfinders were trucks and subject to a 25 percent import duty, while four-door Pathfinders were cars, subject to only a 2.5 percent duty.\n\nOne gripe we have with Pathfinder (and 4Runner) is that in a U.S. market begging for function yet fun, for multipurpose use and the ability to stay on the road or take a side trip off it, and to be able to load it up with people and down with luggage, it is annoyingly narrow. It’s time the Japanese look atthe dimensions on the Explorer and Grand Cherokee, realize an expansion is in order and let out the sides a notch or two.\n\nThe Pathfinder is 66.5 inches wide, the same as the 4Runner. But the Explorer is 70.2 inches wide, and the Grand Cherokee is 69.3 inches wide. Those added inches mean you feel less confined.\n\nPathfinder’s 3-liter, 153-horsepower V-6 has about as much zip as the 4-liter, 145-horsepower V-6 in the Explorer, but it isn’t as powerful as the 4-liter, 190-horsepower in-line six in the Grand Cherokee or the 4.3-liter, 165-horsepower V-6 in the Blazer.\n\nThe mileage rating for the V-6 and four-speed automatic in our test vehiclewas 15 m.p.g. city/18 highway. That means frequent stops for refueling.\n\nSnow Belt dwellers can take advantage of the part-time four-wheel-drive traction. The hubs lock automatically, but to engage 4WD you have to fiddle with the transfer case on the floor and don’t have the luxury of a dash-mounted push button, unlike in the domestic rivals. Given the narrow interior space, the transfer case on the floor stands out like a barricade.\n\nPush-button four-wheel-drive activation is comin g because more and more people are demanding it, but you need to be patient a while longer in the Pathfinder.\n\nThe vehicle is equipped with anti-lock brakes, but for the rear wheels only. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes would be preferred, but two-wheel is less costly.\n\nA quick check of the steering-wheel hub reveals no “SR” (supplemental restraint system) lettering to indicate an air bag is inside. Like push-buttonfour-wheel drive, an air bag is coming, but again you must be patient.\n\nOur test vehicle came with 31.10 15-inch monster tires, which are added forthe macho, chew-through-the-mud, toss-out-the-sand image. On dry pavement at speed, as you approach a sharp corner the appearance of those treads becomes secondary to the need for stability. Oversize tires make the vehicle feel top-heavy and a bit uncertain whenever the road isn’t straight. We prefer the standard P235 15-inch tires for better handling.\n\nWe also would like to see Nissan design smaller hea drests. The rests are solarge they block side and rear vision. The way to win back visibility is to remove the headrests, which makes you ask why they have to be so big that you don’t use them. (At least when the rear-seat rests are removed you can fold and move the seats forward to increase cargo space.)\n\nAnd we’d really like Nissan to shed the tubes hanging by the rocker panels and come up with some integrated steps to make for easier entry and exit.\n\nFinally, the sunroof is one of those twist-open rather than power-open types. No gripe, but it would be nice if there were a transparent screen or a covering over the glass to reduce glare.\n\nThe base price of the Pathfinder we drove is $24,770.\n\nStandard equipment includes power steering; power brakes with rear anti-lock; tilt steering; rear wiper, washer and defroster; chrome wheels; an AM/FM stereo with cassette; power windows; power door locks; air conditioning;dual power/heated outside mirrors; power antenna; cruise control; remote tailgate release; dual, illuminated visor vanity mirrors; and velour seats.\n\nThe optional SE package-consisting of oversize tires, alloy wheels, outsidespare-tire carrier, limited-slip differential, fog lights, manual sunroof, driver-adjustable shocks and step rails-added $2,220. Leather seats and trim added $1,120, and a luggage rack was $175. With a $375 freight charge, the vehicle stickered at $28,660.",

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Pathfinder has always had a rugged character, and while the 2006 is quite civilized, it reflects a decision by Nissan to give the Pathfinder enhanced off-road capabilities and a 4.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe Pathfinder, all new last year, is built on the same platform as the Frontier pickup. It has a 112.2-inch wheelbase. The fully boxed, all-steel ladder frame comes from Nissan’s F-Alpha truck platform, and it can underpin a variety of vehicle sizes. It can have a solid rear axle for trucks or independent suspension for SUVs.\n\nStandard equipment includes three-row seating and an automatic transmission. Base prices start at $25,400 for a two-wheel-drive S and top out at $35,700 for a four-wheel-drive LE.\n\nThe test vehicle was an SE Off-Road model, and its base price was $31,300. The Off-Road model has aluminum-alloy wheels, painted front springs, Rancho performance shocks, unique blue seat fabric, Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, and skid plates to protect the chassis from off-road damage. The Off-Road model also has dual-zone automatic temperature control, rear air conditioning and adjustable pedals.\n\nOne of the third-generation Pathfinder’s strengths is its 4.0-liter V-6 that has 270 horsepower and 291 pound-feet of torque. Maximum towing capacity is 6,000 pounds.\n\nThe engine is derived from the 3.5-liter unit used in the Maxima, Altima, Murano and 350Z. It uses variable valve timing, Teflon-coated pistons, aluminum block and a timing chain, rather than a timing belt, for durability. It is tuned for good midrange torque and power. Estimated fuel economy is 15 miles per gallon in the city and 21 on the highway.\n\nPathfinder’s available advanced All-Mode four-wheel-drive system includes two-wheel, auto and four-wheel modes. It has an electronically controlled transfer case. A Vehicle Dynamic Control, or VDC, system is standard.\n\nAn off-road traction system is standard on the SE Off-Road model. Hill Descent Control slows the vehicle on descents without constant application of the brake pedal. Hill Start Assist allows the driver to stop on a slope, release the brake pedal and not roll back for up to two seconds.\n\nThe Pathfinder SE’s cabin is functional but far from plain. The test car’s cloth seats were attractive and should be easy to clean. The cruise control is operated by fingertip controls on the steering wheel. The triple-zone automatic climate system has controls for both front seats as well as the rear seat.\n\nCup holders are plentiful, and the doors have wide storage bins. The center console has handy storage trays for sunglasses and cell phones. Two power outlets are located near the console.\n\nThe second- and third-row seats can be folded down into numerous configurations. The 40/20/40 second-row seat has a one-touch release lever for access to the third row. The front passenger seat also folds for hauling something long.\n\nEach side of the split third row can be folded separately. Headrests do not need to be removed to fold either the second- or third-row seats. Legroom in the third seat is tight and best left to kids.\n\nThe backside of the third row is finished in hard plastic so it makes a usable cargo floor. A hidden storage area is located under the second seat.\n\nThe Pathfinder is assembled at Nissan’s manufacturing facility in Smyrna, Tenn.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $31,300. Options included Sirius satellite radio, power sunroof, rear-seat DVD player, Bose audio system with 10 speakers, heated leather seats, power passenger seat and heated outside mirrors. The sticker price was $37,095.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "The three-row SUV has become the vehicle of choice for large families, and many models in the class have been redesigned or updated in the past few years. For the 2017 model year, the Nissan Pathfinder gets styling updates, new features and a new direct-injection V-6 engine that makes more power.\n\nThe 2017 Pathfinder base price starts at $30,930 (including a $940 destination charge) for a front-wheel-drive S trim level. We tested an uplevel, all-wheel-drive SL trim with an as-tested price of $40,390. The Nissan Pathfinder is available in S, SV, SL and Platinum trim levels, and all trims are available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Key competitors include the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and Hyundai Santa Fe. (See their specs compared here.)\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe most noticeable styling changes are clustered up front, where the Nissan Pathfinder gets new bumper styling, new headlights and a restyled grille that adopts a variation of the design on some Nissan cars, like the Maxima. While the design is more intricate and detailed than what was there previously, it’s also similar enough to the prior Pathfinder’s look that the changes could easily go unnoticed by casual observers. In back, the biggest change is a switch to taillights with mostly red housings.\n\n$$IMAGE- 3, 4, 5$$\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Nissan Pathfinder is the rare three-row SUV with a continuously variable automatic transmission instead of a step-gear automatic. The CVT uses a belt-and-pulley system in place of conventional gears and doesn’t produce the familiar feel that accompanies the upshifts and downshifts of an automatic.\n\nThe transmission is programmed to mimic the feel of gear changes, but the steady engine noise when accelerating is a little different at first. The Nissan Pathfinder’s 284-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 minimizes the differences more than four-cylinder engines typically do; acceleration is swift and the CVT quickly responds when passing and merging. Still, other editors didn’t like the groaning sounds from the drivetrain and thought the V-6 would perform even better with a conventional automatic.\n\nThe Pathfinder driving experience falls behind its three-row competitors in other ways: Its firm-riding suspension lacks the refinement of the Kia Sorento, GMC Acadia and Dodge Durango and doesn’t provide the sportiness of the Mazda CX-9.\n\nFront-wheel-drive Nissan Pathfinders get an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined; all-wheel drive knocks 1 mpg from each of those fuel economy estimates, and the Platinum AWD model gets 21 mpg in combined driving. We averaged 20.5 mpg over the course of 170 miles on a mix of city streets, country roads and highways, which was a little below the Pathfinder’s combined mpg estimate.\n\nInterior\n\nLike the Honda Pilot, the Nissan Pathfinder’s cabin is among the more open and airy ones in the class. There’s good headroom for adults in all three rows of seats (a rarity in the class), and our Pathfinder’s lack of a moonroof added an inch or so of extra headroom in each of its three rows of seats.\n\nEven though we tested an uplevel SL, its interior design failed to impress. Editors thought the cabin looked dated and despite some higher-grade finishes, like cream-colored leather upholstery, many surfaces and materials — like the interior color painted plastic on the dashboard — are too low-rent for a $40,000-plus SUV.\n\n$$IMAGE- 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$$\n\nThe top-of-the-line seats in this Nissan are noticeably cushier than what you’ll find in other three-row SUVs; wide front-seat cushions and a relative lack of side bolstering enhance the easy-chair feel. The cushions of the 60/40-split second-row bench seat are similarly soft, and the seat slides forward and backward and reclines. It’s very comfortable.\n\nThe second-row bench incorporates a unique walk-in feature for easier third-row access. Lifting a lever slides the seat forward and also flips up the seat cushion against the backrest. This collapsed position lets the seat move closer to the back of the front seats, leaving a wider opening to get in and out of the third row.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nAfter you experience the Nissan Pathfinder’s multimedia system, you get the feeling Nissan couldn’t decide how the driver should use it. There are many ways to accomplish various tasks, and the result is an unwieldy arrangement of buttons and knobs in the middle of the dashboard. Simpler layouts with fewer buttons, like the Kia Sorento’s touchscreen interface, are easier to use.\n\nStandard features include an 8-inch touchscreen, a CD player, a USB port, satellite radio with three years of the SiriusXM Travel Link service, and Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and streaming audio. (Travel Link provides real-time sports scores, movie times, gas prices and weather updates, among other information.) Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, which can mirror select phone apps on a car’s dashboard screen for easier, safer use, are not offered.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nWith all three rows of seats in place, the Nissan Pathfinder has 16 cubic feet of cargo room. There’s 47.8 cubic feet with the third row folded and a maximum of 79.8 cubic feet when the second and third rows are down. There’s also an oversized glove box for additional storage. A hands-free power liftgate is now available and can be activated by waving your foot under the rear bumper. \n\n$$IMAGE-13$$\n\nThe Pathfinder’s 6,000-pound maximum towing capacity is 1,000 pounds greater for 2017 thanks to drivetrain updates and reinforcements near the trailer hitch receiver. Its rating is 1,000 pounds more than most competitors’ but falls short of the Durango’s 7,400-pound rating when equipped with rear-wheel drive and a V-8 engine.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Nissan Pathfinder its highest rating — good — in each of its various crash tests, and the SUV received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest five-star overall rating. Forward automatic emergency braking is a new option for 2017 and is included on Platinum models. The system received IIHS’ highest rating: superior.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and SL and higher trims have Nissan’s 360-degree camera system that can show a bird’s-eye view of the SUV’s surroundings. This feature is not standard on the S or SV. The camera images look a little blurry on the dashboard screen, but the system was a big hit with editors, who liked the extra measure of safety when entering and leaving parking spaces. Other available active safety features include adaptive cruise control and a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nNissan’s updates to the Pathfinder follow a familiar formula in the auto industry: Tweak the styling and add some features to keep the model fresh in shoppers’ minds. The automaker went even further than the mid-cycle update norm by giving the SUV a significantly revised V-6 engine, along with other changes.\n\nEven with these changes, however, it doesn’t feel like Nissan did enough; apart from the Pathfinder’s relatively spacious seating and cargo areas, the SUV feels a step behind the competition in other key areas.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Time to bid adieu, so long, farewell and thanks for the memories to the Nissan Pathfinder-at least to the current version that was designed and developed, built and marketed with the Japanese market, and not the U.S. one, in mind.\n\nLate this year or early next, the next generation Pathfinder will wend its way to market, a vehicle that promises to be more in keeping with the tastes of the American buyer, Nissan says.\n\nTo get an idea of what those buyers want in 1996, we test-drove a Pathfinder LE 4WD to learn what they get in 1995-no air bags, anti-lock brakesonly on the rear wheels, styling so outdated the Willys Jeep looks nice in comparison, narrow dimensions that cramp leg and shoulder room, a rear seat sadly lacking in occupant space and a design that requires rear-seat passengers to crawl over a wheelwell to enter or exit, which means you could spend a great deal of your winter at the cleaners refurbishing the soiled duds.\n\nPathfinder enjoys success because sport-utilities are the hottest vehicle in the market. When a segment is hot, every vehicle in it shares the wealth. Sport-utilities in recent years have gotten wider and roomier with carlike ride and handling. Pathfinder hasn’t.\n\nThe ’96 will have larger dimensions, more modern styling, dual air bags andfour-wheel ABS. Welcome to the real world.\n\nAs for the current version, the 3-liter, 153-horsepower, V-6 provides adequate power with 4-speed automatic but the 15 mile-per-gallon city/18 m.p.g. highway fuel economy rating is disappointing.\n\nStandard equipment includes power brakes and steering, steel-belted radial tires, luggage rack, privacy glass, bodyside pinstripes, AM/FM cassette with eight speakers and compact disc player, air conditioning, leather seating surfaces, heated seats, power windows/locks, power liftgate/window release, reclining front/rear seats, cruise control, split foldaway rear seats, electric rear window defroster, leather wrapped steering wheel, intermittent wipers, carpeted floor mats, side-door guard beams, child safety rear locks and flipup sunroof.\n\nThe sunroof is a nice touch because most sport-utilities lack one in favor of places to store garage door opener/sunglasses holder in the roof. Our test model also came with a rubber surface running board, which was slippery when wet. Not a nice touch.\n\nBase price is $30,359. The only added cost is $390 for freight, a much morerespectable and less profit-motivated charge than you get from the domestic automakers.\n\nNissan’s Infiniti division has a new luxury sport-utility coming for 1997. With a base price of $30,359 on the current Pathfinder, you have to wonder howluxurious and how high-priced the exotic Infiniti will be. It may be built offthe same platform as the next generation Pathfinder. Nissan won’t say.",

      "expert_review": "Compared with the competition, Nissan was way, way behind the curve when it came to capitalizing on the sport-utility-vehicle craze. Economic hardship required the company to rely on the Pathfinder and its Infiniti derivative, the QX4, for far too long. By the time Nissan launched its entry-level SUV, the Xterra, for the 2000 model year, Toyota had been selling the RAV4 for four years.\n\nAn influx of cash from new owner Renault allowed Nissan the luxury of designing and building more vehicles. Nissan and Infiniti now offer a total of six SUVs, and a new car-based, sub-Xterra model may soon be added.\n\nThe problem with having lots of SUVs – and it’s a problem Toyota and Lexus have encountered with their eight sport-utes – is that, at some point, you are competing not only against other manufacturers but against yourself.\n\nCase in point: The all-new 2005 Nissan Pathfinder. The original Pathfinder was a compact, nimble, rugged SUV that remains a very good used-car buy. But as Nissan has sent the Xterra slightly upmarket, it had to make the Pathfinder bigger and more deluxe to create some level of product differentiation.\n\nBut as it made the Pathfinder more upscale, it now treads close to the same territory as the Nissan Armada, the company’s SUV flagship.\n\nThe Pathfinder shares the angular, slightly lumpy styling of the Armada, which is not exactly setting the market on fire. The Pathfinder is, in fact, built on the same basic platform as the Armada, as is the Titan pickup truck.\n\nAt first glance, the Pathfinder does not appear to be that much smaller than the Armada, but at 187.6 inches in length, it’s 9.3 inches shorter and nearly 800 pounds lighter. On the road, the Pathfinder feels bigger than it is too. Besides the dimensions, the biggest difference between the two is the engines: The Armada has a 5.6-liter, 305-horsepower V-8, while the Pathfinder has a 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V-6. The Armada is bigger inside, but both vehicles offer three rows of seats.\n\nNissan has priced the base models of the Pathfinder very aggressively, with the XE model starting at just more than $25,000. That’s the rear-drive model; if you want four-wheel-drive, it’s $2,000 more. At that price, the Pathfinder is a very attractive buy. When you start adding equipment, though, the difference between the Pathfinder and Armada shrinks. The test Pathfinder was the top-of-the-line LE, with rear-wheel drive. Base price was $32,550, and with shipping, a $2,000 navigation system and a $1,600 rear-seat DVD entertainment package, the total was $36,710.\n\nBase price of an Armada SE is $33,600. If you can live without the Pathfinder LE’s leather upholstery, power sunroof and the aforementioned options, the Armada SE is the better buy, especially if you tow. The Pathfinder tows up to 6,000 pounds, but the Armada tows as much as 9,100 pounds.\n\nThat said, maybe you don’t want a vehicle that big, so the Pathfinder may be preferred. The front and middle seats are plenty roomy, but the third seat is best for children or midgets.\n\nAlthough the 4.0-liter V-6 may seem smallish for a vehicle that supposedly can tow 3 tons, don’t be put off: It’s one of the most powerful, gutsiest V-6’s ever. Nicely matched to the five-speed automatic transmission, there’s all the power you need. After all, 270 horsepower is 35 more than the 4.7-liter V-8 in the Toyota Land Cruiser has. It also results in fuel mileage that is, well, less terrible than some SUVs: 16 mpg in the city, 23 mpg highway.\n\nI like this Pathfinder LE a lot, but approaching $37,000 for a rear-drive SUV, I’d be tempted to drop down to a less deluxe model and get four-wheel drive. For a rugged, truck-based SUV like this, I’d rather have some off-road capability than heated power mirrors and a power passenger seat.\n\nFeel free to disagree.\n\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\n\nBase price: $32,550.\n\nPrice as tested: $36,710.\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-drive SUV with a 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V-6 engine and a 5-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

      "expert_review": "Some SUVs are trucks intended for families, softened and eased for family living. Some trucks are insulted by the very thought. The 2010 Nissan Pathfinder is of the second group. It’s a truck made for rough roads and cargo. Sure, throw a few kids in there; the Pathfinder can take it, but don’t go looking for extra cupholders or a roomy third row. This is a truck that won’t accommodate. Love it or leave it. If I were a single person with lots of gear or a big dog I might have loved the Pathfinder. As I am a mom with lots of gear, a small dog and children, I’ll leave it, thanks.\n\nIt’s not that the Pathfinder is awful. Life with kids can work in the Pathfinder. We managed a week with only minor grousing and made it to all our sporting events, classes and errands. Life continued on as usual, but there is just so much of that Pathfinder that didn’t fit into our plans. That third row? We never used it. My 10-year-old preferred to sit in the second-row seat rather than cram himself into that teeny seat in the third row. The big V-6 engine with the 6,000-pound towing capacity and four-wheel drive? Yeah, we live in the suburbs and don’t own a boat or a horse trailer. We didn’t need that.\n\nWhile the price tag was moderate – the Pathfinder SE 4×4 model I drove cost $36,615 and the base model with rear-wheel drive starts at $27,540 – its EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway and premium gas requirement means this SUV isn’t exactly economical.\n\nI will admit that driving the Pathfinder is fun. It sits up high on the road, allowing me to look down upon other vehicles. Literally. The ride is typically bouncy, which is actually pretty entertaining. I’d rather bounce over obstacles than pound into them like a sports car. So, while I felt most of the bumps in the road, it was a bit like riding in a moon bounce. In a good way. The brakes felt solid and brought the Pathfinder to a stop even more quickly than I had anticipated, which only made me feel more secure. The V-6 engine has power enough to match its roar, and it tore up hills and freeway on-ramps like it was on fire. No mountain was too steep for the Pathfinder, and no freeway driver was too aggressive. Other drivers should fear the Pathfinder. I found myself driving more aggressively than usual just because I could.\n\nIn the end, though, all that bouncing, hill climbing and cargo loading was fun, but just not how I live my life. The Pathfinder is a decent truck, as trucks go, but I’m just not a truck kind of mama. I prefer a bit more softness, subtlety and ease to my daily drive. \n \nEXTERIOR\nThe 2010 Pathfinder is unapologetically boxy. It could have been built with giant Duplo blocks. However, it’s not bad-looking. It’s tough, strong and doesn’t fool around. This is a truck that means business.\n\nIn front, wide-set headlights anchor the corners, while a big grille is wrapped in chrome. My SE 4×4 model came on beefy 17-inch alloy wheels and serious tires designed to take on pretty much any road surface you’d care to throw at them. My newly paved suburban roads never stood a chance. In fact, I think I may have heard the Pathfinder yawn once or twice.\n\nGetting in and out of the Pathfinder could be a challenge, but a running board provides a needed step up. In particular, it makes getting to the third row more manageable. The front doors open fairly wide and easily, but the rear door handles are set high up at window level rather than in line with the front door handles. While it’s certainly no problem for adults, small children can’t reach it. My 7-year-old even struggled with it occasionally. Preschool-age kids won’t stand a chance.\n\nLoading cargo into it is easier than loading kids. Once it’s released, the liftgate almost lifts itself, and the cargo floor is right at hip height, meaning no lifting up or down when loading groceries or anything else from a cart. The rear window also pops open separately for easy access to cargo.\n\nThe 2010 Pathfinder comes with a 4.0-liter V-6 engine that makes 266 horsepower and 288 pounds-feet of torque. That means it can power up a hill with a loaded trailer while the air conditioner blows at full, icy blast. The Pathfinder can switch from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive at low speeds. There’s no need to stop in the mud and manually switch anything.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe interior of the Pathfinder was where I had most of my problems. I may have even used an inappropriate word or two in frustration.\n\nMy problem was I couldn’t figure out how to use most of the systems. It took me the full week of my test drive to figure out how to use the Bluetooth system. I looked in the manual, and it told me to press buttons that weren’t there. Silly me, I was trying to read the manual and hook up my phone while safely parked in my driveway. The Bluetooth system is voice activated and only works while the car is moving. Seriously? That’s safe.\n\nI also didn’t know that the Pathfinder had XM Satellite Radio until I stumbled on it accidentally. There’s no indication on the audio controls. I only found it by scrolling through FM1, FM2, AM and then XM popped up. Cool! (Insert frustrated growl here.) There’s also an MP3 jack in the Pathfinder but no USB interface. At least the climate control was easy enough to work since we were blessed with a heat wave during my test drive. There are vents for all three rows and the automatic climate control has dual zones, so the husband and I didn’t need to argue about the definition of “freezing.”\n\nI did enjoy the multitude of storage options in the front seat. There were cubbies and bins everywhere, generously sized to stash all my stuff. Cupholders are conveniently placed and have removable liners that wash out easily. The large center bin has slots for coins and CDs, as well as a plug for charging electronics and a deep well for tossing all my loose items or a medium-size purse. Even the door bins are useful with bonus bottleholders.\n\nThe plush cloth seats in the seven-seater are comfy enough, but they show every speck of lint, dust and Goldfish cracker crumb. I’m a big believer that leather is always worth the investment when kids are involved. Controls for the rear air conditioning sit on the back of the center console, as do the second row’s cupholders, which are near the floor. Only kids out of boosters will be able to reach them, though. A small armrest folds out of the back of the seat, but it’s just a short shelf. It doesn’t boast any cupholders or hidden storage compartments.\n\nThe first two rows are roomy and comfy enough to help absorb some of the bouncy ride, but the third row is almost a joke. I had to sit sideways to fit in it, and even my kids didn’t want to sit back there after the first time they tried it. Those two extra seats are for short trips and emergency carpools only. Access to the third row is not overly difficult. The second-row seats fold and tumble forward to create a passageway.\n\nWith the third row folded down, there’s plenty of room in the flat cargo area. I was never pressed for space, even when I forgot to remove the baseball gear before I went grocery shopping. There are cubbies on the sides of the cargo space that will hold a couple of gallons of milk or a large jug of laundry detergent.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nBecause they’re height adjustable, the Pathfinder’s rear seat belts fit kids and adults alike. This means I could safely let my 7-year-old ride in the second row using only the seat belt.\n\nThe lower Latch anchors are a breeze to use. They’re easily accessible, making child-safety-seat installation refreshingly simple. However, there are only two sets of Latch anchors in the second row and none in the third. There’s room in the second row for even the bulkiest of infant-safety seats, but there’s not room for three car seats in the second row. I wouldn’t attempt to install a car seat in the third row. It’s just too cramped back there.\n\nThe Pathfinder has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, electronic stability control, traction control, side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for all three rows.\n\nFour-wheel drive is optional, so is a backup camera, which is part of a $3,050 options package.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Pathfinder here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nThe Nissan Pathfinder is a roomy SUV with seating for seven in three rows. All models come with a 284-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that teams with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nChanges for 2020 are limited to a new Rock Creek Edition, aimed at buyers looking for a more rugged, off-road look. Available with front- or all-wheel drive on SV and SL trim levels, the Rock Creek Edition includes unique 18-inch wheels and tires, a black mesh grille, black roof rails, black door handles, black mirror caps and black badges. Inside, the Rock Creek Edition gets two-tone seats, contrast stitching and more badges.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder Are Most Important?\n\nAll models have standard automatic emergency braking, and all but the base S trim have blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. SL and Platinum models feature a 360-degree camera system. Nissan also gives shoppers the choice of front- or all-wheel drive on all versions, and all Pathfinders have a roomy, easily accessible third row.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nDespite several strong points, the Pathfinder competes with a flock of three-row SUVs that offer as much or more in the way of features. The Pathfinder suffers from a loud engine and a ride that’s rough and unrefined compared with other SUVs. Moreover, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto still aren’t available.",

      "expert_review": "Nissan’s midsize Pathfinder blazed a trail when it was introduced in 1986, and now, 11 years later, it continues to hold its own in a field that is crowded with comparable SUVs.\n\nThe Pathfinder is, and has always been, a trucklike vehicle with off-road characteristics and a much more rugged persona than many of the now-popular crossover SUVs.\n\nThe test vehicle was an SE equipped with the off-road package, and the rugged tires and special suspension meant that the ride was choppier than the ride of a normal Pathfinder.\n\nPrices for the 2007 Pathfinder start at $25,600 for a two-wheel-drive model and $27,200 for four-wheel drive. The test car had a base price of $31,650.\n\nThe test car was a 2007 with the 4.0-liter V-6, but for 2008 Nissan plans to offer the Pathfinder with a new 5.6-liter V-8 with 300 horsepower. Other changes for 2008 include new exterior styling and a greatly refined interior, as well as newly available technology such as a revised Nissan navigation system with 9.3-gigabyte music box hard drive on the LE.\n\nThe Pathfinder’s rugged looks play a large part in its appeal. In addition to the Pathfinder, Nissan’s family of SUVs now encompasses the Armada, Xterra and Murano. All but the Murano are truck-based vehicles with body-on-frame construction.\n\nThe fully boxed, all-steel frame no doubt contributes to the vehicle’s weight, but it also gives the Pathfinder the strength to be quite capable off-road.\n\nThe chassis has a 112.2-inch wheelbase. Overall length is 187.6 inches, thanks to short front and rear overhangs that give moderate off-road capability.\n\nThe test car’s 4.0-liter engine was quite pleasant because it delivers the bulk of its power across a wide rpm range. Although this engine is similar to the one found in the Altima, Maxima and Murano, it has a longer stroke that gives it more torque, and that’s useful in an SUV.\n\nThe engine also has variable valve timing, a variable intake system and an electronic throttle. The block is aluminum.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission has widely spaced gears for strong acceleration and relaxed cruising.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the Pathfinder can tow 6,000 pounds.\n\nThe Pathfinder’s third-row seat is fairly small, but it does provide a place for youngsters. The third seat is split 50/50, and it yields a flat cargo floor when folded. The back of the seat is covered with a hard surface, and eight hooks in the cargo hold are convenient for tying down gear.\n\nThe second-row seat is split into a 40/20/40 unit with three sections. A one-touch release lever moves the outer sections for easy access to the third row. The second-row seat also has a storage area underneath it.\n\nSide and side-curtain airbags are part of an airbag option package.\n\nWhile the Pathfinder has a rugged persona, the cabin of the SE is far from rough. The test vehicle’s heated leather front seats were quite comfortable, and creature comforts included a power sunroof, rear-seat entertainment system and 10-speaker Bose stereo.\n\nThe Pathfinder is now 3 years old, but it is holding its own quite nicely.\n\nPrice The test car’s base price was $31,650. Options included sunroof, airbags, Bose stereo, rear-seat entertainment system and leather seats. The sticker price was $38,090.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "During my college days, there was a certain kind of boy that was messily preppy and had a penchant for the outdoors, good music and good times; this guy almost always seemed to drive a Nissan Pathfinder. Today, their days are spent at the office, at their kids’ sporting events and yes, even driving carpool and going to the grocery store. Times have changed. Thankfully, the Pathfinder has also changed.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Nissan Pathfinder is now much more a family-oriented crossover than it is a college boy’s rugged SUV.\n\nThe Pathfinder is now built on the same unibody structure as its lauded cousin, the Infiniti JX35. It comes standard with comfortable seating for seven and is filled with thoughtful storage spaces. Family needs weren’t overlooked in the redesign: The second-row seats can slide and tip forward with a forward-facing child-safety seat installed in them.\n\nBut like those college boys, the Pathfinder retains some of its spirit. For a family car, it’s pretty fun to drive. With its 3.5-liter V-6 engine, it has some pickup, handles the stop-and-go traffic on city streets well and makes easy work of passing slower cars on the highway.\n\nThe 2013 Pathfinder has a starting price of $29,495, including an $845 destination charge. I tested a midlevel SL trim with front-wheel drive that cost $35,695.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 Pathfinder trades its boxy looks for curves that help improve its aerodynamics and fuel economy, and I think they give it a generally more feminine aesthetic. This rounder styling is like a man bag or murse: women will laud it for its practicality and style while men might take some time to warm up to it since it doesn’t roar with testosterone.\n\nThanks to the new unibody platform, the Pathfinder’s step-in height is passable for small children, and the doors are within reach for most school-aged children. The doors are also reasonably lightweight, making them easy to open and close.\n\nEighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, fog lights and heated power side mirrors are standard on the SL trim. An SL Premium Package ($2,650) adds a panoramic moonroof among other things, and a Trailer Tow Package ($400) is also available, allowing the Pathfinder to tow up to 5,000 pounds. That’s less than the previous-generation Pathfinder but probably more than enough given the target market for this crossover.\n\nA power liftgate is standard on the Pathfinder SL. Rear cargo space isn’t great with all three rows in use — it rarely is — but the addition of a deep under-floor compartment adds to the cargo area’s usability. Bonus: It comes in handy for stashing gifts away from the prying eyes of excited children. The Pathfinder’s total cargo volume behind the third row is 16 cubic feet. With the second and third rows folded flat — something that’s easily accomplished thanks to the quick pull of a few straps — it bumps up to nearly 80 cubic feet.\n\nThe 2013 Pathfinder has a standard 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 260 horsepower. It has a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. It gets an EPA-estimated 20/26 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 19/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. It uses regular unleaded fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Pathfinder’s interior is quite attractive, comfortable and well-equipped. The cabin materials used appear upscale, and the SL trim featured some faux-wood trim, comfortable seating and an intuitive center stack that houses a 7-inch color monitor.\n\nAvailable features include a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and a dual-screen DVD entertainment system. The SL Premium Package also includes an upgraded Bose audio system.\n\nInterior storage is impressive with eight cupholders plus six bottleholders for a grand total of 14 beverage holders. That’s two beverage slots per passenger in a packed car for those of you doing the math. There is a decent-sized center console that couldn’t fit my purse but could hold some snacks, a cellphone and a few other small items. The large glove box with organizational pockets might fit a small handbag — ahem, or man bag — and tiered seatback pockets are great for holding kids’ books.\n\nSeating for seven is standard and third-row access is great. Thanks to the new Pathfinder’s use of the Infiniti JX’s technology, the second-row seats slide fore and aft about 5 inches, and they can tilt forward and slide with a forward-facing child-safety seat installed in the second row, which creates third-row access. It’s a huge boon for parents of small children. Furthermore, the third row can fit an average-sized adult male, and it reclines for added comfort. The second row has a 60/40 split and the third row is split 50/50.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe Pathfinder has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats. They’re easy to get to thanks to pliable cushioning. Three top tether anchors are located midway down the second-row seatbacks. The third row doesn’t have any lower Latch anchors (I wish it did), but it does have a tether anchor. Seat belt buckles are on stable bases, making it possible for older children to strap themselves in independently. Find out how the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the 2013 Pathfinder an overall safety score of four stars of five. It earned four stars in the frontal crash test and rollover-resistance test. It received five stars in the side-impact crash test.\n\nThe Pathfinder SL has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera with rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. The standard Easy Fill Tire Alert system includes an individual tire pressure display, which is something I find useful because I detest having to figure out which tire is giving me trouble.\n\nAll-wheel drive is optional. \n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nThe Nissan Pathfinder is a three-row mid-size SUV with the handsome boxiness of celebrated Nissan off-roaders past, like the first-generation Pathfinder and Xterra. It’s powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 with 284 horsepower and 259 pounds-feet of torque. A nine-speed automatic backs the V-6; front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. The off-road-oriented Rock Creek trim level squeezes 295 hp and 270 pounds-feet from the same engine, but the Rock Creek is meant for light off-roading, not hardcore rock-crawling. The Pathfinder’s competitors include the Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Subaru Ascent and Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nSV and Rock Creek trim levels get a standard power liftgate for 2025, and all Pathfinders include three complimentary oil changes during the first two years or 24,000 miles. Otherwise, there are no changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Nissan Pathfinder Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix speakers\nKeyless entry and start\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n13-speaker Bose audio system\nWireless phone charging\n20-inch wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nPower-adjustable front seats\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated outboard second-row seats\nHead-up display\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nSurround-view parking camera\nFront parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nThe Pathfinder is a decent three-row SUV that holds its own in a class of very strong competitors. The first two rows of seats are comfortable and spacious, but the third row and cargo area are smaller than some competitors’. Easy fitment of child-safety seats is another strong point. This Nissan rides and handles well, and great visibility makes it relatively easy to maneuver and park, but its infotainment system feels dated and isn’t as easy to use as some class rivals’.",

      "expert_review": "Drowning in a sea of SUVs?\n\nWhile Nissan is trumpeting a powerful new engine for its 2001 Pathfinder, there is little else to differentiate this Japanese-built four-door utility vehicle from a swarm of competitors. Where the entry-level Xterra has personality in spades, its elder sibling looks and feels more generic – despite a mild face-lift in 1999 and an all-new instrument panel this spring, plus a generous assortment of gadgets and power accessories. At $30,000, this Pathfinder is no path-breaker. Nor is it a bargain. Or so Paul thinks.\n\nShe: You can tell a lot about a person by what they drive. I often wonder about the message I send behind the wheel of my yellow Beetle that reminds me of one of those yellow happy faces. My friend Liz – Liz the Bold – drives a `97 Pathfinder. She ditched a nursing career to hook up with an Internet company. She grew her hair long – well into her 40s. She wears off-the-shoulder dresses – to work. And for fun, she’s the coxswain for a mostly male rowing team. How cool is that? And she loves her Pathfinder.\n\nHe: I don’t think she’d see much of a difference between her `97 Pathfinder and the 2001 model we tested. The basic design of the current Pathfinder actually dates to 1996, and it’s starting to look and feel its age. Instead of tweaking it here and there, Nissan needs to do a total redesign. There are just too many newer, fresher and more interesting SUVs out there.\n\nShe: Now hold on. I found the new Pathfinder to have a certain kind of honest charm. It is a lot more “trucky” than some of its competitors, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee. I like looking out over the hood of the Pathfinder. There seems to be a lot of squared-off sheet metal in front of you. It reminds me of my old 1994 Blazer. And there are old-fashioned levers and controls to play with. Instead of a rotary switch or push button, you shift from two-wheel drive into four-wheel drive with a shift lever next to the transmission. And some people will like the fact that you can get a manual gearbox with the 2001 model.\n\nHe: I thought the five-speed was a novelty, and not much practical use in everyday driving. The new engine is a twin-cam 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 250 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of torque with the manual transmission. If you order the four-speed automatic, the engine is tuned a little differently to deliver 240 horsepower and 265 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a lot more muscle than last year’s 170-horsepower 3.3-liter V-6. Despite the additional horses, our test vehicle with the five-speed too often felt sluggish and underpowered. That’s truly amazing for an engine that purports to be the most powerful six-cylinder in the class.\n\nShe: The new Pathfinder almost had a split personality. You’ve got truck-like features, but the top-of-the-line SE version we drove is decked out with lots of amenities. Standard features now include goodies like a six-disc in-dash CD changer, a Bose audio system with six speakers and halogen fog lights. Our test vehicle had a base price of $29,349 and was equipped with a $1,099 sunroof package that included lighted vanity mirrors, a temperature gauge and a digital compass.\n\nHe: I was pretty impressed with the ride quality, considering the Pathfinder started life as a truck. The coil-spring suspension helps soak up bumps and potholes, and front and rear stabilizer bars keep body roll to a minimum. The SE comes with fat 255/65/R16 tires, which also help cushion the ride. But I’ve also taken Pathfinders well off the pavement, and they’re extremely competent. The truck we tested is so fancy, though, I’d almost hate to get it dirty.\n\nShe: Part of the charm of the Pathfinder is that it’s somewhat unusual. It’s not like the Ford Explorer, which is everywhere, so you see yourself coming and going a thousand times a day. I think basically you’re just afraid that if I like the Pathfinder, I’m going to end up like Liz and ditch you, dye my hair tinum and start wearing sarongs. Is that what’s bothering you, honey?\n\nHe: That’s sarong answer.\n\n2001 Nissan Pathfinder\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: acceptable\n\nLikes: Larger, more powerful engine. Relatively comfortable ride for an SUV. All the amenities of a near-luxury passenger car. Five-speed manual transmission can be ordered. Has sort of a primitive trucky charm (Anita).\n\nDislikes: Still feels underpowered. Strictly middle-of-the-pack styling. Not much else to set this sport-ute apart from the competition. No bargain at nearly $31,000.\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger sport-utility vehicle\n\nPrice: Base, $29,349; as tested, $30,968 (including $520 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 250-hp; 240 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 mpg city/18 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,380 (*Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower,depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Kyushu,Japan",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2012 about the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nNissan admits that it’s among the last automakers to offer a crossover with three rows of seats, something Honda and Toyota have peddled since the early 2000s. Through September, three-row midsize and large crossovers have edged north of 660,000 sales. Every major automaker except Volkswagen now offers one, and that may soon change (see the post).\n\nNissan’s solution: Re-imagine the aging Pathfinder — historically a truck-based SUV, most recently with combined EPA city/highway mileage ratings as low as 14 mpg — into something that competes squarely with the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nThe 2013 Nissan Pathfinder boasts handsome styling and a decent, if imperfect, compromise between drivability and fuel efficiency.\n\nCertain trim levels have subpar tech features, but the Pathfinder has a few strengths that should get the attention of family shoppers. Trim levels include the S, SV, SL and Platinum; each can have front- or all-wheel drive. Compare them here, or stack up the 2012 and 2013 Pathfinder here. I drove SL and Platinum versions.\n\nWagon-Like Styling\nWhere Honda doubled down on blocky SUV styling with its second-generation Pilot, the Pathfinder looks more like a tall wagon, with overall height — 69.6 inches — on the shorter end of the competitive set. But the face borrows more from Nissan’s truck-based Xterra and Armada than from its car-based Rogue and Murano. It’s more of a statement than the bulbous tail, whose blocky window spoiler and generic taillights don’t make much of an impression.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 20-inchers installed on the Platinum. Fog lights are optional on the S and SV and standard on higher trims.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nNissan swapped the old Pathfinder’s truck-suited drivetrains — a 4.0-liter V-6 or 5.6-liter V-8, each with a five-speed automatic — for its familiar 3.5-liter V-6 and continuously variable automatic transmission. The duo provided enough oomph for rapid elevation changes, but the so-called “next-gen” CVT’s penchant to hunker back into lower revs makes for some lag when you dig into the gas while passing. Still, once the V-6 kicks up to higher revs the Pathfinder moves out, though not as stoutly as a V-6 Toyota Highlander or Chevrolet Traverse. Fans of the old V-8 Pathfinder will find little comparison when it comes to passing power or towing capacity, the latter of which drops from 7,000 pounds to a more crossover-competitive 5,000 pounds. Nissan says buyers cared much more about gas mileage than towing.\n\nTo that end, Nissan removed hundreds of pounds from the Pathfinder in its redesign — between 279 and 508 pounds, depending on V-6 trim. That’s atypical in a segment where weight gains are the norm even when SUVs move to more modern platforms (see the Dodge Durango or Ford Explorer). The Pathfinder boasts an excellent EPA-estimated gas mileage rating of 20/26 mpg city/highway (22 mpg combined) with front-wheel drive, and all-wheel-drive versions are rated 19/25 mpg (21 mpg combined). Both figures edge out the major competition by 1 to 2 mpg, though one Explorer variant — front-drive with a turbocharged, four-cylinder EcoBoost engine (20/28 mpg) — has Nissan beat.\n\nRide & Handling\nUnfortunately, that efficiency doesn’t come for free. Nissan says low-rolling-resistance all-season tires helped save a few tenths of a mile per gallon, but I found they surrendered grip too easily in tight corners. The same held true with two tire sizes on two trim levels: Bridgestone Dueler Sport P235/55R20s on a top-of-the-line Platinum and Continental Cross Contact LX P235/65R18s on the Pathfinder SL.\n\nThe sidewalls protested even during modest high-speed curves. A Pilot and Highlander I drove the same day had better grip.\n\nHandling and ride composure in normal driving otherwise impressed, with good steering feedback on winding roads and a settled wheel at highway speeds.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Pathfinder’s cabin shows clear design similarities to its platform sibling, the Infiniti JX35, though the Nissan is expectedly less rich, with harder textures up front and less padding where backseat passengers rest their arms. It is, however, competitive with its non-luxury ilk, if not as roomy as some of them.\n\nThe second-row seats sit low to the floor, and adults in the second and third rows will have to work out a compromise for acceptable legroom. With 5.5 inches of second-row seat travel, either row can enjoy room aplenty if the other one gets very little, so negotiate wisely. Third-row headroom, by contrast, is good. The third-row seatbacks recline — a rare bonus — but the Explorer and Durango have the comfiest third rows.\n\nNissan’s Latch and Glide system allows third-row access if you’ve installed a child-safety seat in the second row. The passenger-side seat (sans child) tips forward while keeping the child-safety seat installed, but the walk-in path is more of a squeeze-by setup. Without the child seat, both sides collapse forward — similar to the chairs in GM’s three-row crossovers — for a wider entrance.\n\nLuxury options include heated and cooled front seats, two moonroofs that cover all three rows and a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, but there are a few utility shortfalls.\n\nFold the seats down and numerous gaps in the floor threaten to catch your cargo. Maximum luggage volume — just 79.8 cubic feet — roughly matches the Explorer but trails the Pilot (87.0 cubic feet), Highlander (95.4 cubic feet) and Traverse (a mammoth 116.3 cubic feet).\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Pathfinder has yet to be crash-tested. Standard features include all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and six airbags, with curtain airbags for all three rows. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe front-drive Pathfinder starts around $29,000, including an $825 destination charge. All-wheel drive adds $1,600 to any trim. Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, tri-zone automatic climate control and a CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and an auxiliary jack but not Bluetooth. USB/iPod integration and Bluetooth phone operation come on the SV and SL, but only the Platinum has Bluetooth audio streaming — downright stingy, given the popularity of music on smartphones these days.\n\nMove up the trims and you can get dual moonroofs, a power liftgate, power front seats with heating and cooling, heated rear seats, leather upholstery and a heated steering wheel. A loaded Pathfinder Platinum will set you back around $44,000.\n\nPathfinder in the Market\nThe Pathfinder’s handsome cabin styling and driving refinement — tires notwithstanding — should help family buyers overlook its modest cargo room. Can Nissan find the sales success of a Pilot or Explorer? Established automakers and small players alike have struck out (see: Hyundai Veracruz and Subaru Tribeca) in the attempt, but I suspect the Pathfinder won’t go their way. With six SUVs and a minivan in its lineup, Nissan has strong people-hauling credentials. It’s missed a big chunk of the market for years, but at long last, the new Pathfinder fills the gap.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "When SUVs first arrived on the American scene, they were purpose-built, off-road adventure and utility vehicles. They weren’t luxurious and they weren’t comfortable; they were work wagons used by forest rangers and farmers. Somewhere along the way, they became eight-seat family vehicles, replacing the station wagon and minivan in most driveways. But the trend we’ve spotted for the 2020s seems to be an effort by automakers to recapture some semblance of that off-road adventurism after decades of moving toward making them glorified tall wagons.\n\nThe latest automaker to do that is Nissan, which has redesigned the latest 2022 Pathfinder three-row to be more rugged, more outdoorsy and slightly more capable in the dirt than its solidly street-oriented predecessor without giving up any of the luxury, safety and connectivity that modern families expect in an SUV. I drove the new ’22 Pathfinder through Southeast Michigan recently to see if Nissan’s moves to butch up the new Pathfinder have paid off.\n\nRelated: 2022 Nissan Pathfinder: Going Rogue\n\nThe Family Resemblance Is Strong\n\nThe fourth-generation Pathfinder was a generic blob-shaped thing that bore no family resemblance to the chunky original 1986 model at all. This new fifth-generation model is a complete departure that incorporates some styling cues from the original Pathfinder, such as the forward-swept C-pillar, three-slot grille and overall squared-off, thick body styling. It’s actually a little shorter than the outgoing model, but changes its proportions by being taller and wider.\n\nI have to say it looks much, much better than the last Pathfinder, with definite family resemblance to the latest angular Nissans like the larger Armada and smaller Rogue. The slim headlights taper into the wide and prominent fenders, with the taillights stretching across the rear to again emphasize the Pathfinder’s width. Its geometric looks make the new Pathfinder feel like a larger vehicle than the one it’s replacing, but the overall dimensions don’t change all that much. Suffice it to say, it both looks and feels big — this was not an effort to slim down the SUV, this was an effort to make it look more rugged and aggressive, and it worked well. \n\nIt Expects You to Drive Like the Family’s in There\n\nPowering the 2022 Pathfinder is the same 3.5-liter V-6 that’s in the outgoing model — it makes 284 horsepower and 259 pounds-feet of torque, which is unchanged from the previous Pathfinder. What’s new is what that engine is connected to: a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission, replacing the unloved continuously variable automatic transmission in the old Pathfinder. That change is meant to improve the Pathfinder’s off-road ability, its towing durability, its driving dynamics and more — and in most ways, it delivers. It doesn’t sacrifice gas mileage, which is up 1 mpg combined in AWD versions over the 2020 model (the last model year sold). Lower trim levels increased from an EPA-estimated 22 mpg to 23 mpg, and the AWD Platinum is up from 21 to 22 mpg. The combined rating remains 23 mpg for front-drive Pathfinders, but the city/highway distribution has changed slightly to 21/27 mpg city/highway.\n\n2022 Nissan Pathfinder | Cars.com photo by Leslie Cunningham\n\nDriving the new Pathfinder is best done at a relaxed pace, as if the whole family is on board for a ride and you don’t want kids dropping juice boxes or Grandma to stress any joints. With moderate acceleration, the V-6 is perfectly adequate, the new nine-speed auto-shifts smoothly and calmly, and the whole experience is that of a big, heavy SUV doing what it does best: ferrying the brood to soccer practice or the mall in quiet comfort. The transmission does hunt a lot for its gears, but with nine speeds to play with, this is to be expected — only occasionally does it feel like it’s missing the beat and not keeping up with the driver’s anticipated moves. For example, when coasting down to a stop but then deciding to give it some more power as traffic has cleared from a light, it gets a little confused and might select a gear lower than it needs to. But overall, the powertrain is smooth, refined and perfectly adequate to the task of powering the Pathfinder.\n\nThe Pathfinder’s overall feel is of a heavy SUV, however, especially when negotiating tight turns and roundabouts or performing hard acceleration and braking maneuvers. Body movement is pronounced in such situations, squatting hard on its rear haunches under full acceleration, diving noticeably under hard braking and plowing through quick turns with considerable understeer. It doesn’t like being hustled along quickly, lacking the athletic feel that a Ford Explorer has with its tightly controlled body motions and punchy turbocharged engines. Slipping the drive mode selector into Sport mode does improve steering feel and feedback, but it becomes clear to the driver that this is the equivalent of a family minivan, not a sports wagon, and that you (and your passengers) are going to be happiest keeping the Pathfinder at a simmer rather than a full steaming boil. \n\nComfort and Style Aplenty\n\nBut the Pathfinder will happily simmer along all day, with a truly comfortable ride even on high-spec models that have big wheels and low-profile tires. Road noise does make it into the cabin, again thanks to those big wheels and tires, and it’s made even more noticeable by the lack of wind noise to mask it. But the overall serenity of the Pathfinder’s completely redesigned cabin is barely affected by the outside world. The new look inside is excellent, with a modern feel and updated electronics that combine with solid material choices and build quality to create a well-updated cabin. \n\nSeat comfort is good, but we’re still not seeing the “magic” of the so-called Zero Gravity Seats. They just feel like seats — no better or worse than any others, really (except, perhaps, for the aforementioned Explorer, which has seat bottoms that feel too short). There’s noticeably plentiful passenger space, however, with tons of room up front or in the sliding second row, both for width and legroom. The third row in many three-row SUVs is often best used only for children, with a few notable exceptions (like the Volkswagen Atlas and Hyundai Palisade). The additional width that comes with the new 2022 Pathfinder makes the third row here a usable size for adults, as well, especially given the second row’s sliding ability, allowing for passengers in the second and third rows to negotiate available legroom among themselves. Third-row ingress and egress is easy, too, thanks to Nissan’s one-touch EZ Flex Latch and Glide button that slides and tilts the second row, even with child-safety seats attached.\n\nThe updated interior electronics are welcome, with an available 9.0-inch touchscreen multimedia system that’s located high on the dash for easy visibility and use. It’s accompanied by an available 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that provides all sorts of information, some more useful than others, and two different configurations that look slick. There’s also an available 10.8-inch head-up display that puts all the relevant information up in the driver’s sight line but features an oddly offset speedometer readout. Still, everything is clear and easy to read, and after some experimentation with configurations and settings, you’re sure to find a setup that provides all the information you want without having to hunt through menus. As with most new vehicles these days, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard, and Wi-Fi connectivity with wireless charging is available. \n\nAbout That Ruggedness …\n\nNissan felt it important to demonstrate that the new Pathfinder is a capable off-roader, as the changes made to amp up its rugged image are more than just cosmetic. That’s why the company booked some time at Holly Oaks ORV Park north of Detroit for a brief romp through the dirt and mud to show off the Pathfinder’s terrain select function.\n\nRotating the selector through the options to the Mud and Ruts function changes a host of vehicle attributes, while a quick push of the central button engages the automatic hill descent control. And with that, the Pathfinder was off to tackle terrain that it’s unlikely to see in the hands of typical buyers — loose gravel ascents, steep and slippery slopes — which it did without complaint or difficulty, it must be said. We didn’t do any serious rock crawling, but let’s be honest here: Despite the Pathfinder’s looks, this is not a proper off-road machine. It does feature a new clutch that allows for predictive all-wheel drive (no longer waiting for front-wheel slip to be detected before engaging the rears, the computer makes the call before that happens now), but the all-season tires, lack of underbody skid plate protection and no locking transfer case mean this is still a soft-roader, and that’s perfectly fine. You can option up a Pathfinder with accessories that make it a bit more capable, but anyone serious about going further off-road is likely looking at a Nissan Titan pickup in Pro-4X trim instead. Suffice it to say that the Pathfinder will handle rutted dirt roads and family off-grid camping duty just fine thanks to its softer suspension, but you’re not likely to ever see one out overlanding across the Arizona desert.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Nissan Armada: 5 Pros, 4 Cons\n2021 Nissan Rogue Review: More Steps Forward Than Backward\n2021 Nissan Armada Review: Incremental Improvements\nNissan Launches Online Shopping Program\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2021?\nSimplified Ordering and Pricing\n\nNissan has kept the trim levels and pricing for the new Pathfinder simple with four trim levels. Two option packages are available, as well, so finding a Pathfinder that has a specific option you want (like the panoramic moonroof or leather interior) means finding the required trim level. The starting price is $34,560 for a front-wheel-drive S trim, which is roughly $1,400 more than the outgoing 2020 Pathfinder, while a Platinum 4WD rings in at just less than $50,000. That’s a healthy jump over the outgoing model, but it does reflect considerable added standard equipment, the most important of which might be the updated Nissan Safety Shield 360 system that brings automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, high-beam assist and class exclusive rear automatic braking — that last one being a key feature for a family car, where kids may be running around the vehicle. The Pathfinder also features a driver alertness sensor, rear door alert and rear sonar as standard, with blind spot intervention, lane intervention and traffic sign recognition as optional. Nissan’s latest ProPilot Assist cruise control is also available, which helps steer the vehicle on the highway but doesn’t let you remove your hands from the steering wheel, unlike GM’s Super Cruise system.\n\nSo in the end, yes, the new Pathfinder is indeed a bit more rugged and a bit more capable off-road. But honestly, I think the areas that will matter more to its intended buyers are the better interior space, top-notch connectivity, smooth and quiet ride, and its ability to be an even more comfortable and capable family vehicle. The trend toward being more outdoorsy after enduring pandemic lockdowns will match well with the Pathfinder’s new image and abilities, but it’s good to know Nissan hasn’t sacrificed the aforementioned areas in which the Pathfinder needed to be good in favor of new areas where it really didn’t need to go at all.\n\nRelated Video: 2022 Nissan Pathfinder: First Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Nissan’s Pathfinder never kowtowed to the swoopy crossover trend and didn’t fall to the sedan-ification of SUVs like some of its competition.\n\nOf course, there’s a price to pay for its truck-based SUV ways: With the 2011 Nissan Pathfinder, a three-row SUV, it comes mostly in the form of reduced gas mileage and a trucklike ride that can get tiresome.\n\nMy test Pathfinder was a Silver Edition, which celebrates the Pathfinder’s 25 years in America and adds 17-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, heated front seats and a 10-speaker Bose sound system. It has a 4.0-liter V-6 and an adjustable drivetrain that allowed me to choose two-wheel drive, 4-High or 4-Low. I liked having the choice; it made me feel able to attain the high end of the Pathfinder’s EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway. Having a little control helps because the Pathfinder uses premium gas and that will get pricey.\n\nEven with its truck platform, the Pathfinder was comfortable on the road, but it had a stiff suspension. There was some body roll in corners, too. Overall, I liked the ride. It reminded me I was in an SUV and not a posh crossover.\n\nFor those who like to go out and play with their truck, their toys and their kids, the Pathfinder can be a pretty good fit. It has a starting MSRP of $28,570. The price of my midlevel Pathfinder Silver Edition 4×4 was $38,485.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Pathfinder is rectangular to the extreme, and it has 17-inch alloy wheels, a towing hitch and rugged tubular running boards. There are no sinewy curves here.\n\nThere are a couple hiccups, though. First off, if you want your small kids to get in this three-row SUV, you’ll have to wait until they’re taller or be ready to help them for a while because the rear-door handles sit up high. Kids will figure out a work-around eventually, but until then you’re their primary door-opener and that can get old. For adults, the Pathfinder is easy to get into, which surprised me. Because the Pathfinder looks so much like the Nissan Armada, I kept expecting to have to take a giant step to get in it. A couple of times, I took too big of a step and hit my head on the doorframe.\n\nThe cargo area’s load floor is high, but that’s not unexpected. A double-stroller can fit in the cargo area, but parents hefting it might want to see if they can live with lifting it up really high to get in the cargo area.\n\nThe Pathfinder has a 266-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-6 engine that’s paired to a five-speed automatic transmission. A 5.6-liter V-8 engine is available on the top-of-the-line LE trim.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nAfter 25 years in the U.S. you’d think the Pathfinder would have its act together. For the most part, it does, but not across the board and some features seem like they were added to the SUV at the last minute. I was pleasantly surprised by the Pathfinder’s comfortable driver’s seat, however.\n\nThe driver’s seat helped make up for the Pathfinder’s stiff ride. My back never ached and my legs never got tired. I wished the Pathfinder had a telescoping steering wheel, but my test car did have adjustable pedals, which helped somewhat.\n\nThis three-row SUV’s buttons were easy to understand and use. However, there were some stereo knobs that were set apart from the rest of the controls. This seemed weird. Also, there were two power outlets on the passenger side of the center stack that seemed like afterthoughts. I know utility is the opposite of polish most of the time, but it seemed like these details were overlooked.\n\nIn the Pathfinder, there are a lot of functional storage spaces in the front row, but the cupholders annoyed me a little. There are rubber inserts in them that stuck to most water bottles I put in them. Paper cups fared well, as did soda cans. A travel mug is the perfect fit because the Pathfinder has a niche for the handle. A nice touch.\n\nIn the second row, things are less equipped. The cupholders are at the base of the center console’s rear, which is difficult for kids in car seats to reach, and there are pockets on the seatbacks. There was plenty of legroom, though, and the flat floor made carpool drop-offs a breeze.\n\nThere’s also a standard third row in the Pathfinder. It’s easily accessible because the second row’s outboard seats tumble forward. If child-safety seats are in the outboard seats, kids can access the third row by folding the center portion of the 40/20/40-split second row. The third row is small. My kids, ages 7 and 9, were comfortable back there, but adults would find it uncomfortable after a short ride. Both the second and third rows fold flat.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Pathfinder received the top score of Good in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In IIHS rear and roof-strength crash tests, the Pathfinder received the second-to-lowest score of Marginal. In rollover crash tests, it received three out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Pathfinder has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats. The second row is hospitable to child-safety seats — even a rear-facing infant-safety seat — despite the lower Latch anchors being wedged into the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. The seats recline, allowing a good fit for the car seats, and the tether anchors are high on the seatbacks.\n\nThe Pathfinder has standard four-wheel drive, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows of seats.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Nissan Pathfinder Silver Edition here.",

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Pathfinder’s 2022 redesign brought a more rugged exterior, a contemporary interior with increased space, a new transmission and a host of new tech and safety features. For 2023, the Pathfinder returns with minor changes and a base price of $36,295 (all prices include destination charge), plus the addition of the new Rock Creek trim. Shoppers considering the Rock Creek will, however, pay a considerable premium for its off-road appointments with a $44,115 starting price.\n\nRelated: 2023 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek: Now With More Ruggedness\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nAside from the new Rock Creek variant, the 2023 Pathfinder sees a short list of updates: SL models get standard wireless charging; a 10-way power-adjustable passenger seat is added for the SL and highest-end Platinum; and a new captain’s chairs package with a removable second-row console is offered on the Platinum.\n\nPowertrain and Capability\n2022 Nissan Pathfinder | Cars.com photo by Leslie Cunningham\n\nAll 2023 Pathfinder models are powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 engine making 284 horsepower and 259 pounds-feet of torque. It’s paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, which replaces the previous generation’s continuously variable automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on all trims except the Rock Creek, where it comes standard. The Pathfinder’s adventure-oriented features include seven driver-selectable modes (Standard, Sport, Eco, Snow, Mud/Rut, Sand and Tow), a towing capacity of up to 6,000 pounds and standard trailer sway control.\n\nIn addition to a lower starting price, forgoing the Rock Creek offers a slight fuel economy advantage: Most Pathfinder models get up to 21/27/23 mpg (city/highway/combined) with FWD, according to EPA ratings, while the Rock Creek drops to 20/23/21 mpg.\n\nTech and Safety\n2023 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nStandard tech features include an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; a larger 9-inch touchscreen, 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, head-up display and 360-degree camera system are available. A suite of safety and driver-assist features comes standard as part of Nissan’s Safety Shield 360: automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and high-beam assist. Optional features include blind spot intervention, lane departure steering assist and traffic sign recognition. Nissan’s ProPilot Assist is standard on higher trims and adds hands-on driver-assist tech like lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control down to a stop.\n\nThe 2023 Pathfinder recently earned a Top Safety Pick Plus award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and performed well in two new tests: a side impact crash test and nighttime pedestrian detection system evaluation.\n\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n\nOn sale now, the 2023 Pathfinder comes in five trims: S, SV, SL, Rock Creek and Platinum. Starting prices for the S and SV increase by $360, the SL by $880 and the Platinum by $830. With marginal changes for 2023, shoppers can save by choosing a 2022 model. Below is a breakdown of the Pathfinder’s trims, standard features and starting prices; AWD adds $1,900 to the S, SV, SL and Platinum. (All prices include a $1,295 destination fee.)\n\nS: $36,295\nSV: $39,115\nSL: $42,715\nRock Creek: $44,115\nPlatinum: $49,265\n\nThe Pathfinder S comes exclusively with a second-row bench seat for up to eight occupants and gets standard cloth seats, a 7-inch digital gauge cluster and six-speaker sound system. Standard exterior features include LED headlights, a chrome grille and badging, body-colored mirrors and bumpers, and 18-inch painted aluminum-alloy wheels.\n\nThe SV offers optional second-row captain’s chairs to seat seven and adds heated front seats, heated side mirrors, a roof rack, leather-wrapped steering wheel, adaptive cruise control and ProPilot Assist.\n\nThe SL builds on that with a power liftgate, leather seats, a 9-inch touchscreen, built-in navigation, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and wireless charging. It also comes with a more advanced version of ProPilot Assist that adjusts speed based on curves and traffic signs.\n\n2023 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAvailable exclusively with second-row captain’s chairs, the new Rock Creek features an off-road-tuned suspension, 18-inch beadlock-style wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires, a tubular roof rack, tow hitch and harness, LED foglights and a 360-degree camera system with an off-road mode. Other visual cues that set the trim apart include a dark-painted grille and Rock Creek badging, plus imitation leather and cloth upholstery with orange stitching found inside.\n\nThe range-topping Platinum adds a standard power tilting panoramic moonroof, motion-activated power liftgate, 20-inch machined aluminum-alloy dark-gray wheels, 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, head-up display and a premium Bose 13-speaker audio system.\n\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe 2023 Nissan Pathfinder’s starting price falls mid-pack among its three-row competitors: The 2022 Ford Explorer starts at $37,005; the 2023 Hyundai Palisade at $36,245; the 2022 Kia Telluride at $34,725; the 2022 Subaru Ascent at $33,970; and the 2022 Toyota Highlander at $37,190.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Nissan Pathfinder Review: Outdoor Adventure Wagon Rebooted\n2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Part Deux: Our Second Take on Nissan’s Latest Family Hauler\nIs the 2022 Nissan Pathfinder a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\nIIHS: Pedestrian Detection Systems in Most Mid-Size Vehicles Fail After Dark\nResearch the Nissan Pathfinder\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Nissan’s first Pathfinder blazed a trail when it was introduced in 1986. The Pathfinder is, and has always been, a trucklike vehicle with off-road characteristics and a more rugged persona than many of the now-popular crossover SUVs. It has standard third-row seating.\n\nPrices start at $27,210 for a two-wheel-drive S and top out at $40,210 for a four-wheel-drive LE with the optional 310-horsepower, 5.6-liter V-8. The test vehicle was a four-wheel-drive SE, and its base price was $32,510. The V-8 has a 7,000-pound towing capacity.\n\nThe 4.0-liter engine has 266 horsepower. It delivers the bulk of its power across a wide rpm range. Although this engine is similar to the one found in the Altima, Maxima and Murano, it has a longer stroke that gives it more torque, and that’s useful in an SUV. The V-6 can tow up to 6,000 pounds.\n\nFuel mileage is rated at 14 mpg in the city and 20 on the highway.\n\nThe aluminum-block engine also has variable valve timing, a variable intake system and an electronic throttle.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission has widely spaced gears for strong acceleration and relaxed cruising.\n\nThe Pathfinder’s rugged looks play a large part in its appeal. It has a fully boxed all-steel frame that contributes to the vehicle’s weight, but it also has the strength for heavy towing and off-road use.\n\nThe wheelbase is 112.2 inches and overall length is 187.6 inches. Short front and rear overhangs are useful for off-roading.\n\nWhile the Pathfinder has a rugged persona, the cabin of the SE is far from rough. The test vehicle’s heated leather front seats were quite comfortable, and creature comforts included a power sunroof, rear-seat entertainment system, rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity and a 10-speaker Bose stereo with XM satellite radio.\n\nThe Pathfinder’s third-row seat is fairly small, but it does provide a place for youngsters. The third seat is split 50/50, and it yields a flat cargo floor when folded. The back of the seat is covered with a hard surface, and eight hooks in the cargo hold are convenient for tying down gear.\n\nThe second-row seat is split into a 40/20/40 unit with three sections. A one-touch release lever moves the outer sections for easy access to the third row. The second-row seat also has a storage area underneath it.\n\nThe SE has standard side and side-curtain airbags.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test vehicle’s base price was $32,510. Options included sunroof, heated leather seats and Bose stereo with satellite radio. The sticker price was $38,190.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Nissan Pathfinder SE 4X4\n\nEngine: 4.0-liter, 266-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nFour-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 112.2 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,801 lbs.\n\nBase price: $32,510\n\nAs driven: $38,190\n\nMPG rating: 14 city, 20 hwy.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though the 2024 Nissan Pathfinder finished second-to-last in our 2024 3-Row SUV Challenge, we still found plenty to like about it, including impressive cabin quality, an excellent digital driver’s display, great visibility and solid ride quality — just don’t try to put full-size adults in the third row.\n\nVersus the competition: While we disliked the Pathfinder’s surprisingly rough engine idle, cramped third row and lack of cargo space with all seats in place, it was a lot closer to the top in our three-row SUV comparison test than its finishing spot might have you believe, with just a handful of points separating it from first place.\n\nLet’s skip the preamble: If the 2024 Nissan Pathfinder suits your budget, vibe and needs, go for it. There’s nothing “wrong” with Nissan’s three-row SUV, and the complaints that did surface in our recent comparison test were certainly not glaring enough to keep it off any shopping lists.\n\nThat being said, it wasn’t particularly great at much, either. In our scoring, it had one outright win — for visibility — and finished in a three-way tie for first in child-safety seat fitment. Last-place finishes came in powertrain, value and cargo volume, with the Pathfinder offering just 9.1 cubic feet of Cars.com-measured cargo space behind its third row.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2024?\n\nThat’s hardly Miata-small, but this stuff matters when you have an active family life with kids, pets and all the associated accoutrement to haul around. On the other hand, in-cabin stowage for daily detritus — like phones, water bottles, cords, purses and snacks — was top-notch. Impressive organizational features in the Pathfinder include a removable second-row console and a cavernous cubby under the shifter.\n\nClassy Digs\n\nOur judges also dug the Pathfinder Platinum’s cushy interior appointments, which channel more than a smidge of its luxury sibling Infiniti’s premium ’tude. Surprisingly, the Pathfinder’s materials were some of the nicest in the test, and its reserved, modern cabin presentation was noted by a number of drivers. In spite of the Pathfinder’s low value score — meaning how much equipment you get for your cash — the interior certainly felt upscale to use. In addition to plenty of soft touch points and quilted leather surfaces, the Pathfinder was the only SUV of the bunch with a power-adjustable steering wheel. It’s a small detail, but it all adds up.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nPassenger room was fine — unremarkable apart from the third row, which was rather cramped. Kids aren’t likely to notice, but larger teens and adults will take umbrage with the odd head restraints and cramped quarters for their legs and shoulders. Second-row passengers are much better off, with excellent head, shoulder and legroom.\n\nTech Talk\n\nInterior tech in the Pathfinder is an exercise in contrasts. While the 12.3-inch configurable digital driver display is impressive and decidedly premium in both operation and presentation, the available 9-inch infotainment touchscreen is a sore point. Judges found the display too small for this Nissan’s class and price, and the user interface itself is a jumbled, frustrating and outdated mess. Convoluted menu nesting led judges to scramble to the safety of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto whenever possible.\n\nRide Quality, Power and Efficiency\n\nThe Pathfinder’s road manners are less disappointing. Ride quality is well damped, with impressive body control, bump isolation and reasonably limited body lean when you find yourself charging up an Alpine pass. The Pathfinder’s naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 is more than powerful enough for a daily hustle, with 284 horsepower and 259 pounds-feet of torque, but a noticeably rough idle and gruff engine noise intrude into the cabin; it turned off some judges. It scored fairly low in the powertrain category as a result, though it did match the Hyundai Palisade’s and Kia Telluride’s powertrain scores. The nine-speed automatic transmission was a welcome shift from Nissan’s usual continuously variable automatic transmissions, and it proved no smoother or clunkier than the other gearboxes in the test.\n\nThe Nissan tied the Telluride for fifth place in our real-world fuel economy test, but the numbers show just how close things were. The Pathfinder’s observed gas mileage of 23.8 mpg lagged the Hyundai Palisade by just 0.1 mpg, and the Honda Pilot and Volkswagen Atlas were just 1 mpg better than the Pathfinder, at 24.8 mpg. Only the Toyota Grand Highlander, the lone hybrid in our test, pulled way out in front, with observed fuel economy of 35.1 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich 3-Row SUV Has the Best Real-World MPG?\nVideo: Which 3-Row SUV Has the Most Cargo Space?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Nissan Pathfinder?\n2024 Nissan Pathfinder Stays on the Same Path, Starts at $37,145\nShop for a 2024 Nissan Pathfinder\n\nSo, there are plenty of things we like about the 2024 Nissan Pathfinder and a number of things we don’t. It was far from being the front-runner in our comparison, but despite its sixth-place finish, it also didn’t trail way behind — proving you really can’t make a poor decision in this vehicle class. The Pathfinder wouldn’t be our first — or even our fifth — choice, but it’s still worth a test drive if you like what it has to offer. For you, it just might be perfect.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nThe Pathfinder is a roomy SUV with seating for seven in three rows. All models come with a 284-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that teams with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nRear parking sensors and two USB type-C ports are now standard, and SV trim levels add adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. SL and Platinum models gain LED headlights.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder Are Most Important?\n\nAll models have standard automatic emergency braking, and all but the base S trim now have blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. SL and Platinum models feature a 360-degree camera system. Nissan also gives shoppers the choice of front- or all-wheel drive on all versions, which also have a roomy, easily accessible third row.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder?\n\nDespite several strong points, the Pathfinder competes with a flock of three-row SUVs that offer as much or more in the way of features. The Pathfinder also suffers from a loud engine and a rough ride that's unrefined compared with other SUVs. Moreover, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto still aren’t available.",

      "expert_review": "One of the quickest “fixes” a manufacturer can make to a platform that has fallen out of favor is to soup it up. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s too little, too late. In the case of the Nissan Pathfinder, it’s certainly not too little, but it may be too late.\n\nThe biggest rap against the compact sport-ute was that it was underpowered. One acidulous critic compared its performance to that of a garbage truck – how nasty, but how true. With 168 horses and two tons for them to move, it WAS a slug, unacceptable, given the $33.9K price tag on the one tested last year. Nissan heard my complaint and those of a multitude of consumers and went rummaging in its parts warehouse. The answer was at hand in the form of the splendid 3.5-liter six-cylinder engine used of late in the recently-reworked Maxima sedan.\n\nLet the bargain-basement new offering, the Xterra, use the old, trucky 3.3-liter – that’ll get buyers to save their pennies for something better. The big-bucks Pathfinder deserves this little bit of underhood commonality with its zoomy cousin, although I’m a little surprised Nissan didn’t keep the older energy factory on the base XE version.\n\nA truck and a sporty sedan have somewhat different usage patterns and thus, engine demands, but in this case that nicety is obscured by the vast improvement in poke and some clever retuning. The Max engine makes 250 hp when coupled with the four-speed automatic, 240 when mated with the five-speed manual. That’s better than a 40 percent increment. Torque – of more interest in the day-to-day, even if the vehicle stays on paved roads – gets an appreciable boost, too – to 240 foot-pounds with manual trans and a bountiful 265 with the automatic.\n\nBottom line is the machine goes from a lumbering 12-seconds-plus to a very competitive low-8-second range with the five-speed 4×4 version I tested, perhaps a second worse with the automatic. (It might be even swifter with the two-wheel-drive setup, which is not a very rational choice for a sport-ute.)\n\nIt’s an aluminum engine, top and bottom, and weighs 35 pounds less than the smaller-displacement unit it supersedes. It has four valves per cylinder, with variable valve timing and intake paths. The one downer is that in bumping the compression ratio up to 10:1, Nissan created a desire for premium (91 octane) fuel. And this machine, with its mass and aerodynamics, does have a bit of a thirst. EPA ratings are 16 mpg city, 18 highway, same as last year. I logged 16.2, driving mostly on country roads with a bit of four-wheelin’ in construction areas thrown in, with near-constant use of air conditioning.\n\nGiven its derivation, it’s not surprising the engine is somewhat rev-happy. It’s languid below 3,000 rpm, but when the shorter air path opens up and the valve timing switches over to performance mode, it really comes alive, with a well-machined clatter from under the hood and a pleasantly growly exhaust note, almost as v iscerally appealing as a typical V-8’s.\n\nThe manual transmission, a rarity in up-market SUVs, shifted reasonably well and the clutch was not daunting, a good thing, since some finesse is required for off-road or heavy-weather excursions. Fifth is an 80 percent reduction or overdrive ratio, yielding about 26 miles per hour per 1,000 engine turns for relaxed freeway cruising.\n\nThe Pathfinder is reasonably quiet at the highest legal speeds, with airflow managed well and only a modest amount of tire noise intruding, as is to be expected with mud-and-snow-rated skins. The XE, mid-level SE and luxurious LE all run on 16-inch alloys, the upper levels getting slightly wider tires (255 – 65) on individualistic wheels.\n\nWith its unibody construction, the Pathfinder evinces good chassis rigidity, and build quality on this sample was far better than on the last one I tried. There were no thumps or rattles or groans, even when we were bulling our way over challenging ter\n\nWith MacPherson struts up front and a solid axle plus coil springs in the rear, the Pathfinder still isn’t going to win any deportment awards for its off-road demeanor, for it is after all, more of a foul-weather friend than a jungle stomper. On paved and maintained roads, it rides well and isolates passengers from the occasional surface problem.\n\nOnly the top-level LE can be had with a full-time all-wheel-drive system which can transfer as much as 50 percent of the available torque forward under the direction of a gaggle of sensors. The lesser models have a part-time 4WD system brought into play via a floor-mounted lever at speeds up to 50 mph. Actuation was nearly instantaneous and practically imperceptible. A low-range transfer case setting is also available, engaged while stopped and in neutral, for enhanced engine braking or tough going.\n\nAll series have the same largish disc brakes in front, drums rear, with four-wheel antilock standard. Stopping distances were comfortably short, and pedal feel was good, with nice progressivity and easy modulation. The antilock was an unobtrusive friend when I woke it up on wet pavement.\n\nThe front cabin was decently roomy, with just barely enough headroom, while the back would be cramped for normal-sized adults. Passenger volume is just 92.9 cubic feet, like a compact car. With the 60 – 40 second seats up, there’s a generous 38 cubic feet of gear space available, which can balloon to 85 c.f. if the seats are folded. Nissan rates the machine at 3,500 pounds’ towing capacity with manual transmission, 5,000 with automatic.\n\nStandard this year are a rear-window deflector, halogen fog lights, steering-wheel audio controls and a fine six-speaker Bose audio system, with a six-disc in-dash CD changer. Clarity and tonality of this rig were excellent, although FM reception was only mediocre, despite the presence of both in-glass and mast antennas.\n\nFit and finish were very good overall. The Pathfinder did very well in government crash tests, garnering four stars (out of five) for driver protection, and five for the co-pilot in frontal impacts, five stars for both in side crashes. It gets appreciably better than average ratings from those who respond to Consumers Union reliability surveys.\n\nBase price on the five-speed SE is $29,349. That is a well-equipped machine, with the usual array of power assists, air conditioning, limited-slip differential, antilock, cruise control, privacy glass, tow hooks, cargo tie-downs, remote keyless entry, security system, cargo cover, tilt wheel, 12-volt power taps, rear defroster and leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter. The only addition to the tester was the sunroof package (power sunroof, dual lighted vanity mirrors, HomeLink transmitter, compass and outside temperature gauge) for $1,099. Total, with freight, was $30,968. The new-found power makes it a lot more competitive in this league.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2008 Pathfinder is relatively unchanged, aside from the newly available V-8 engine. Larry Dominique, Nissan vice president of product planning, said a V-8 was added to the Pathfinder lineup in response to customer demand for more engine power. Rated at 300-plus horsepower, the V-8 gives the seven-seat Pathfinder SUV the ability to tow up to 7,000 pounds when properly equipped. The Pathfinder’s center dash controls have also been redone and now have a more refined appearance.\n\nExterior\nFor the most part, the Pathfinder looks much like last year’s model. The front bumper has been mildly restyled and the doors have new rub strips. Standard aluminum wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but 17- and 18-inch wheels are offered. A sunroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Pathfinder has room for seven. Cloth seats are standard and leather seats are optional. The available navigation system includes a 9.3 GB hard drive that can hold music files. Dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a Bose sound system and a DVD entertainment system are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base 4.0-liter V-6 makes 266 hp, while the optional 5.6-liter V-8 produces 300-plus hp and 380-plus pounds-feet of torque. The engines both team with a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, active front head restraints and an electronic stability system are standard. Side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and power-adjustable pedals are optional.",

      "expert_review": "My brother worked in the newsroom of a television station for a while. His advice to me was simple. “Never ride with a photographer,” he said. “They’re always looking for the next picture, rather than down the road.”\n\nCertainly my boss can vouch for that. He spent three terror-filled hours in the backseat of a Pathfinder driven by a photographer going at least 70 mph over glare ice a couple winters back. To say that the interior of the truck was resculpted with fingernail indentations wouldn’t be too far off the mark. That my boss is still alive rather than road-kill on I-95 also speaks volumes about why so many people are stepping up to the all-weather capabilities of SUVs. And make no mistake, they ARE stepping up.\n\nThe Pathfinder has found its way into many garages for a myriad of reasons.\n\nLike all SUVs, it’s rugged looking. It looks like it will go anywhere, even over your neighhbor’s freshly watered lawn.\n\nIt’ll get you to work despite the foot of snow that’s falling. (Although WHY you would want to reach work when a foot of snow is falling is beyond me).\n\nIt’ll haul all the stuff that families tend to accumulate over time and it looks a whole lot cooler than a minivan, even if, for all intent and purposes, it’s just a hiked up, four-wheel-drive minivan. (if you really want cool, try a sports car).\n\nThe Pathfinder returns for ’99 with the typical alphabet soup array of trim choices — XE, SE and LE in 4×2 or 4×4. Minor trim shuffling is the only news here as the truck continues with the same basic look it acquired in its 1996 redesign.\n\nLike too many recent Nissan’s, this one has a very conservative look and it takes few chances stylistically. This is just fine with the perfect-lawn suburban set where me-too-ism runs rampant. But really, a little more brashness in this puppy wouldn’t hurt. But that could be said for most Nissans.\n\nIf you want that distinct look, go for the LE; it has tubular step rails. Wheee.\n\nThe interior is quite functional with a user-friendly instrument panel that is awash in test-tube wood trim. It’s easy to use and figure out.\n\nAt the base of the dash is the lever that activates the four-wheel drive system. The Pathfinder uses a part-time system so that you can get to the office and then return home when you find that you’re the only one stupid enough to make it in.\n\nThe door panel was exactly the same one used in the Frontier pick-up, although this one looks as though Nissan actually spent some money on it.\n\nThe seating position was identical to that of the Frontier. The Frontier was very uncomfortable with its flat hard seat. This flat hard seat had a cushion that adjusted for rake and also benefited from a luxuriously softer feel (thanks to the leather seat surfaces), but seat travel was no better. Back seat space is adequate and there’s plenty of space for terrified passengers to leave fingernail indentations.\n\nOf course, driving over glare ice requires shift-on-the- fly four-wheel-drive and front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes. This puppy has ’em both, along with dual air-bags for when all else fails.\n\nMotivating all this is a 3.3-liter single-overhead-cam 12-valve V6 engine that churns out 168 horsepower and 196 foot-pounds of torque. Considering the SE test-model’s 4,065 pound curb weight, this translates into an adequate power plant that could really use a bit more firepower to match its comptition.\n\nSimilarly, the ride is a nice combination of truck-like firmness and car-like civility. However, it is slowly being eclipsed by its competitors, although the Pathfinder is still a good ride.\n\nThe “Sahara Beige`’ test vehicle exhibited some body lean, but still felt sharp enough to give the driver some fun, despite being in a minivan, er, truck.\n\nI still like this Pathfinder better than most SUVs, despite its conservative demeanor and average power plant. Sure it could use a bit more brashness to match its sharp handlin g, but that migh toffend ex-soccer moms.\n\nOr photographers in a hurry.\n\n1999 Nissan Pathfinder SE V6 4×4\n\nEngine: 3.3-liter SOHC V6 Transmissions: 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic Tires: P235/70R15 or P265/70R15 mud and snow rated radial tires Standard: Power anti-lock brakes, Power rack and pinion steering, four-wheel-drive, dual air-bags automatic climate control, power outlets, cruise control, power windows and locks, rear wiper/washer, cargo net, 160-watt AM/ FM/CD audio system, alloy wheels, heated power mirrors, luggage rack.
