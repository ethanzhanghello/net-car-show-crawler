      "expert_review": "After being introduced (in its current nameplate form) for the 2023 model year and the addition of the track-focused NISMO variant for 2024, things are quiet in the Nissan Z camp for 2025. Bayside Blue, a hue from the discontinued GT-R, joins the Z’s palette, as do a pair of two-tone paint schemes that combine white or red with a black roof.\n\nRelated: 2024 Nissan Z NISMO Quick Spin: The Z You Know, With a Harder Edge\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Nissan Z is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,140 destination charge), is as follows:\n\nSport: $44,110\nPerformance: $54,110\nNISMO: $66,890\nWhat Are the 2025 Nissan Z’s Trim Levels?\n\nEach of the Z’s three trim levels includes distinct hardware to offer a unique performance flavor. The Sport rides on 18-inch wheels wearing Yokohama Advan tires and has 12.6-inch front brakes and 12.1-inch rear brakes. The Performance gets dark-gray 19-inch wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza S007 high-performance tires. Not only are its brakes upsized to 14 inches in the front and 13.8 inches out back, but the calipers are forged aluminum and get upgraded from dual-piston front and single-piston rear iron units to four-piston fronts and two-piston rears. Also riding on 19-inch wheels (but now gloss black), the NISMO wears Dunlop SP Sport Maxx rubber; its front brakes grow to 15 inches, while the rears are the same size as the Performance’s.\n\nBeyond footwear, the Performance adds a limited-slip differential and automatic rev matching for models with the available manual transmission, as well as a front splitter and rear spoiler. The NISMO builds on that with additional chassis bracing and a more aggressive suspension tune, plus unique exterior styling that includes exclusive front and rear bumpers, sill panels, a distinct grille and three-piece rear spoiler. The NISMO’s extra bracing and aero addenda increase weight by about 100 pounds versus the comparable Performance trim.\n\nInside, the Sport’s cabin is pretty basic, with manually adjustable cloth seats, keyless entry and start, automatic climate control, six speakers, and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Step up to the Z Performance and you’ll add power-adjustable and heated sport seats upholstered in leather with synthetic suede inserts, aluminum pedals, and a larger 9-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay. Buyers seeking maximum focus get Recaro seats in the NISMO but forfeit power adjustments and heating.\n\nAll 2025 Nissan Z trim levels are fitted with the same suite of safety tech. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, and automatic high beams.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Nissan Z’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nA twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine powers the Z. In the Sport and Performance trims, it generates 400 horsepower and 350 pounds-feet of torque; for the NISMO, Nissan bumps output to 420 hp and 384 pounds-feet. Sport and Performance buyers have a no-cost choice between a six-speed manual transmission and a nine-speed automatic, but the NISMO is only available with the automatic. All Zs are rear-wheel drive.\n\nNissan says the Sport and Performance trims return the same EPA-rated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission and 19/28/22 mpg with the automatic as the 2024 model (official ratings from the agency for 2025 are not yet available). The NISMO Z is rated at 17/24/19 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Nissan Z Heritage Edition Celebrates First Z Car\nIs the 2023 Nissan Z a Good Sports Car? 6 Things We Like, 2 We Don’t\n2024 Nissan Z NISMO: More Power, More Downforce\nResearch the Nissan Z\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The changes Nissan made to its Z sports car to create the 2024 Z NISMO might seem a bit basic at first glance, but the results are greater than the individual parts. Nissan has transformed the Z into a hard-edged sports car that’s even more suited to track-day duty, though its enhanced capability does come with some tradeoffs in everyday drivability.\n\nRelated: 2023 Nissan Z Review: Relatively Affordable, Lots of Fun\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new high-performance NISMO version of the Z gets an updated suspension, different wheels and tires, larger front brake rotors, styling tweaks, Recaro seats, and a bit more horsepower and torque from the car’s twin-turbocharged V-6 engine.\n\nThe most noticeable difference between the Z NISMO and the regular Z is suspension tuning, which is considerably firmer in the NISMO, locking down the car in corners to really limit body roll. Paired with its aggressive Dunlop summer tires, the Z NISMO feels especially at home in sweeping turns. It’s the driving experience of the regular Z, but even more performance-focused.\n\nThe penalty for this enhanced performance is a very firm ride that can be a bit much in everyday driving; you feel big and small road imperfections in the cabin as you’re jostled around. The suspension responses aren’t harsh, but they’re approaching it.\n\nThe Z NISMO is also rather noisy inside. Much of the noise comes from the exhaust, which produces an ever-present drone as well as occasional popping sounds when decelerating, but there’s also a lot of tire noise in the cabin that creates a dull roar at highway speeds.\n\nThe Z NISMO’s twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine is rated at 420 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque, which is 20 hp and 34 pounds-feet more than the engine in the regular Z. The Z NISMO has a revised version of the nine-speed automatic transmission that’s available in other Zs; Nissan says changes to the automatic produce quicker downshifts.\n\nThe six-speed manual available in other Zs isn’t offered in the NISMO – a decision some enthusiasts will bemoan – but the automatic is a willing partner for performance driving; it readily makes part-throttle downshifts and will drop a few gears if you really step on the gas. The drivetrain includes Standard, Sport and Sport+ drive moves (the latter is exclusive to the Z NISMO), and they’re controlled by a toggle switch on the center console. In Sport+, the transmission aggressively downshifts when braking to keep engine rpm up.\n\nI’d prefer a bit more steering feedback than what the Z NISMO offers, but the car responds without hesitation when you turn the wheel, giving it a nimble, agile feel, and it’s easy to precisely position it on the road.\n\nThe Interior\n\nChanges to the cabin are relatively modest. The main differences are a few center console buttons finished in red, a strip of red leather at the top of the steering wheel, some NISMO graphics, and manually adjustable Recaro bucket seats with fixed head restraints. The seats are more aggressively bolstered than the ones in other Zs, but they’re not as restrictive as the sport bucket seats in the Honda Civic Type R or the Recaros you can get in the Ford Mustang. They’re finished in leather and Alcantara simulated-suede, and they have firm cushioning overall.\n\nThere’s limited visibility over your left shoulder when checking your blind spot from the driver’s seat, but the standard blind spot warning indicators near the side mirrors are easy to see in your peripheral vision and are a helpful visibility aid.\n\nJust like the regular Z, the Z NISMO has a nice balance of touchscreen-based and physical controls. The infotainment system’s 9-inch touchscreen is bordered by volume and tuning knobs, and there’s a row of buttons below the screen. The dials for the automatic air conditioning system are below the strip of buttons, and while they’re basic-looking for a car from the 2024 model year, they’re easy to use, which trumps any aesthetic concerns. As you might imagine, cabin storage space is very limited.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Nissan Z NISMO: More Power, More Downforce\n2024 Nissan Z Continues Around the Track at $43,305, New NISMO at $66,085\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the 2024 Nissan Z\nShop for a 2024 Nissan Z\nIs the 2024 Nissan Z NISMO Worth $66,000?\n\nYep, that’s roughly the starting price of the top-dog Z, which makes it nearly $13,000 more expensive than the next priciest trim level, the Performance, which starts at $53,450 (all prices include destination). A few options – two-tone paint, floor mats and illuminated scuff plates – raised the as-tested price of our Z NISMO to more than $68,000.\n\nNearly $70,000 for a Nissan Z is a bit eye-widening — it’s a long way from the Z’s $43,450 base price. It’s also more than the 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, which starts at $59,780. The Dark Horse is a different kind of performance machine, with a 500-hp V-8 engine and standard six-speed manual transmission, but like the Z NISMO it’s built for track use. If that’s not how you plan on using your Z, save some money (and gain a little comfort) with one of the sports car’s other trims — or even the Mustang Dark Horse, which is also more comfortable on the street.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new 2023 Nissan Z’s updates transform the two-seater into a modern, fun-to-drive sports car that still honors the nameplate’s rich heritage.\n\nVersus the competition: Starting at $41,015, the 2023 Z’s base price significantly undercuts the six-cylinder Toyota Supra’s, and it also feels like a more cohesive sports car from the driver’s seat. \n\nThe new Nissan Z shares its platform with the previous 370Z that was last offered for the 2020 model year, but its exterior styling, interior design and powertrain are all new. At Nissan’s invitation, we traveled to Las Vegas to get behind the wheel of the Z for the first time, spending a day experiencing its straight-line acceleration, road-course handling and street-driving manners (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRelated: Sports Cars Aren’t Dead: Nissan Reveals 2023 Z Coupe\n\nWhat’s Old Is New\n\nFamiliar Z-car styling attributes include a long hood and short rear deck, but rather than take design cues from a single Z-car generation, the 2023 Z’s exterior blends styling elements from different eras.\n\nThe large rectangular grille and LED daytime running lights recall the first generation that arrived in the U.S. in 1969, but as you move to the rear, the design takes after a more recent time, with taillights reminiscent of those on the ‘90s-era 300ZX. You don’t often see this kind of design mashup in new cars, and it might be a bit jarring to some Z-car fans, but the overall look is sleek, sporty and more modern than retro.\n\nPower to the People\n\nPerhaps the most consequential change is under the car’s long hood. Gone is the 370Z’s naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V-6 engine, replaced instead with the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 from Infiniti’s line of Red Sport models. (Infiniti is Nissan’s luxury brand.) The new engine makes 400 horsepower and 350 pounds-feet of torque, which is 68 hp and 80 pounds-feet of torque more than the 370Z’s V-6 in a car that weighs roughly the same at around 3,500 pounds.\n\nThe new engine transforms the Z driving experience. The twin-turbo V-6 is smooth-revving and much more refined than the comparatively coarse 3.7-liter V-6, and the engine’s more accessible peak torque — it’s available from 1,600 to 5,200 rpm versus 5,200 rpm for the old V-6 — makes the car much more responsive at low and mid-range engine speeds. It also pulls harder when accelerating flat out.\n\nThe Z’s new available nine-speed automatic transmission is another reminder of how good performance automatics have become, and it’s also the most effective way to extract maximum performance from the car. The automatic-equipped Z can’t, however, match the level of connection between driver and car that models with the six-speed manual offer.\n\nUnder hard acceleration, the automatic rips off upshifts quicker than you can make with the car’s manual, and when hustling the Z around the road course, it was in optimal gears. The automatic also includes an easy-to-use launch control feature that, when activated, sends the Z hurtling forward from a stop as the rear tires scramble for grip. Driver-initiated upshifts with the shift paddles weren’t as fast as I like, but if you let the transmission do its thing and decide when to change gears, it performs well.\n\nThe automatic is the transmission to get if you’re looking for ultimate performance, but if you want the most engaging driving experience, the manual can’t be beat. The shifter has short throws and a pleasing mechanical feel, and the light clutch pedal won’t tire your left leg. Overall, it’s a very forgiving setup that makes for easy start-offs. Performance trim levels with the manual have a launch assist control system for smooth takeoffs and Nissan’s SynchroRev Match feature, which automatically aligns engine rpm when shifting.\n\nOn the Street and Track\n\nThe previous 370Z had hydraulically assisted steering that lent the steering wheel a heavier feel, but the new Z gets electrically assisted power steering. It steers with a light touch, and steering response is direct and precise. On-center feel and straight-line stability are good, too, which makes for relaxed cruising.\n\nThe front suspension uses a double-wishbone design, while the rear has a multilink setup. There are new monotube shocks, and the Performance trim cars we took on the street and track get larger 19-inch forged-alloy wheels and staggered tires instead of the base Sport trim’s 18-inch alloy wheels and square tire setup.\n\nThe Z is a firm-riding car that lets you know when the pavement is anything less than perfect, but the mostly smooth roads of southern Nevada prevented us from getting a clear picture of how that taut ride quality will translate to the pockmarked and potholed roads we regularly see near Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters. We’ll know more once we test one closer to home, but the firm tuning made for a fun-driving car that felt completely at home on the winding desert roads outside Las Vegas. Though the roads we traveled were pothole-free, they weren’t perfectly smooth, and the result was considerable road noise in the cabin at moderate speeds.\n\nNissan made some lead-follow laps available on a road course at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway complex, and it was just as entertaining in this setting. There’s noticeable but not excessive body roll when taking tight corners quickly, and the car stays on the line you set. The capability of the automatic-transmission Z is apparent here, too, as the car adds speed quickly. Other than upgraded brake pads, Nissan said the cars on the road course were stock.\n\nAn Overhauled Interior\n\nThe cabin gets an all-new design that incorporates more tech features. Sport trims come with an 8-inch dashboard touchscreen featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, while the Performance variant has a larger 9-inch screen and adds navigation. Both trims have a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel that replaces the previous car’s analog instruments. Some design elements have carried over, though, like the three-gauge pod atop the dashboard and the circular air vents in the doors.\n\nDespite the new design, the Z’s interior feels familiar, with the sightlines and driving position similar to the 370Z’s. I’m about 6 feet tall, and while there wasn’t a lot of extra space in the cabin, I didn’t feel cramped or claustrophobic, either. The steering wheel now telescopes in addition to tilting, making it easier to tailor the driving position to your liking, and I had enough headroom and legroom.\n\nI particularly like the Z’s sport seats. The seats in the Sport trim have cloth upholstery and manual adjustments, while the Performance model gets leather trim, seat heaters, power adjustments and different side bolsters. Both the cloth and leather-trimmed seats have large suede-style inserts that firmly grip your backside and do a good job preventing you from sliding around in the seat — even on the track.\n\nStorage areas include pockets in the doors and nooks behind the seats. The revised center console also now includes a second cupholder. Lifting the rear hatch reveals a decent-sized cargo area.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nStandard safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Nissan Z Up Close: Paying Respect to Generations Past\nNissan Z Proto Video: ‘Proto’ in This Case Means ‘Pretty Much What the Z Will Be’\nResearch Sports Cars\nShop for a Used Nissan 370Z\nShould You Buy the Nissan Z?\n\nWith a starting price around $41,000 (all prices including destination), the 2023 Z delivers a lot of driving fun for the money, and the price is the same whether you get the six-speed manual or nine-speed automatic.\n\nStepping up to the Performance trim, however, brings a significant $10,000 price increase: This model costs $51,015. That’s still less than a six-cylinder Supra’s base price, but the extra $10,000 seems like a lot of money for the Performance model’s extra features. In addition to the aforementioned upgrades, the Performance trim gets larger brake rotors, beefier brake calipers, a mechanical limited-slip differential, front and rear spoilers, and a Bose premium stereo.\n\nFor some shoppers, the Z’s available manual transmission could have tipped the scales in its favor compared with the Supra, but Toyota’s high-performance sports car will also offer a manual beginning with 2023 models.\n\nWhile both of these sports cars are powerful and have impressive performance-oriented automatic transmissions, I’d take the Z because it felt more composed overall in a track environment, the interior fits me better, and I prefer its styling. All in all, the Z is more enjoyable to drive, and with these cars, that’s what matters most.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
