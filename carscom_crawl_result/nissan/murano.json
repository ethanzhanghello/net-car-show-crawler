      "expert_review": "I’ve come to feel as though looking for and buying a car is much like buying jeans. The work entailed in finding the right car, particularly including the purchasing process, can be brutal. Throw two small kids into the mix and it suddenly seems rational to keep the old car that you know will break down in the center lane of the highway at any moment. I will do anything, ANYTHING to avoid the 12-minute test-drive that turns into an hour and a half, at best, at the dealership. I will do anything to avoid trying to corral my kids in the dealership parking lot to conduct the child car seat test. So what’s the reward? With jeans, the hard work pays off only after multitudinous walks of shame from the dressing room to the 3-way mirror in the hall. When I find the perfect pair, I couldn’t be more elated than if I’d discovered gold. With a car, the reward is the priceless sense of relief that I won’t have to go through the process again for a long time. Of course, a shiny new car in the driveway isn’t a drag.\n\nIf you can swing it, the reward can be the 2006 Nissan Murano. It is just as good as your new favorite pair of jeans. The appearance of the vehicle has been likened to a shoe and yes, the grill is a little funky-looking. Like a pattern on the back pocket of designer jeans, it’s a bit over the top, but distinctive. And like my favorite jeans, a good fit in a new car is crucial. My 6-foot tall husband must be comfortable, the kids must be comfortable and of course I must be as well. Can you imagine one pair of pants that fits everyone? The Murano is that pair of jeans for my family.\n\nFor the mom-driver, everything is close at hand, yet I also feel like I have a lot of room. There’s plenty of space in the back for my two kids and I can fold down the armrest that houses the cup holders. I have the view of an SUV but the handling of a car, because it’s built on the chassis of a car. I have size but not excessive bulk in the Murano, it’s very responsive and I get an average of 20 miles to the gallon. Tres chic!\n\nBoth sets of Latch connectors in the back seat are easy to use. If I need to haul something around (other than children) I can fold the 60/40 rear seats flat either by pulling a strap on the seat, or via a nifty handle in the cargo area. Just one yank of either and poof, the back seats are down all the way. It couldn’t be easier. The model I have comes with a liner for the cargo area. I don’t worry about tossing dirty bikes or shoes in the back as I can just lift out the rubber liner and wash it off with a hose. Like jeans, the Murano is low-maintenance. The one problem with the back of the Murano is that Nissan doesn’t offer a third row. I’m not entirely sure how one would fit, but I think it’s worth Nissan’s time to research it. The only thing that would prevent me from purchasing a Murano as opposed to leasing one is not having the flexibility a third row offers.\n\nI absolutely love the backup camera in this Murano. It’s a welcome addition to the many other safety features. I am confident pulling out of parking spots with large SUV’s flanking both sides, not to mention backing out of my driveway and also handling more tricky maneuvers like parallel parking. The extra peace-of-mind that Nissan grants me is plenty to rave about and I certainly hope backup cameras become standard for all vehicles in the future. Safety is totally vogue.\n\nIn any case, the Murano makes any purchasing decision easy. A fun, sexy car with no embarrassing three-way mirrors or visible panty lines for a family of four is certainly a gem. If I thought I could get away with it, I’d buy two!\n\n*For more information on the 2006 Nissan Murano and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Nissan’s Murano returns to being a trendsetter for the 2025 model year, but its beauty runs more than just skin-deep.\n\nVersus the competition: Tighter inside than most of its competitors, the new Murano provides a swankier cabin and more engaging driving experience than the Chevrolet Blazer, Honda Passportor Toyota Crown Signia.\n\nWhen the first Nissan Murano was introduced for the 2003 model year, it was something of a revelation: Nobody had really heard of the term “crossover” before, but they knew a good-looking thing when they saw it, and the Murano’s combination of unique style and carlike comfort with a high-riding driving position made it a hit. Over the intervening two generations, however, the Murano seemed to lose its way. No longer really a trendsetter, it became something of a curious mess, and the outgoing model now looks quite long in the tooth and a perfect example of stylists not knowing when to quit.\n\nNow we have the fourth-generation 2025 Murano, and it’s a breath of fresh air in the category. Style has returned to the Murano in spades, with a new look that introduces a bold new direction for Nissan styling overall. It’s accompanied by a sumptuous interior full of the latest technology and a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine instead of the old V-6. The Murano takes on new premium crossovers from Toyota, Honda, Mazda and others, but how does it all come together? We recently drove the new 2025 Murano just outside Nashville, Tenn., not far from where it’s assembled, to find out. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2025 Nissan Murano Loses Some Cylinders, Gains Some Tech Features\n\nIt’s Called Fashion, Linda\n\nThe styling of the newly redesigned Murano is one of its key selling points, something the company specifically focused on to differentiate it from the tons of other crossovers you can buy. It might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s certainly a distinctive shape in a sea of sameness. It really does look quite elegant to me, with a style that feels more upscale than its mainstream Nissan badge would suggest. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the Nissan Ariya electric SUV, but that’s not a bad thing, as the Ariya is itself quite shapely.\n\nThe new front grille displays the new corporate look for Nissan styling, ditching the less-than-successful V-Motion grille design to instead present a more cohesive, flowing look from tip to tail. Twenty-inch wheels are standard on the base SV and mid-level SL trims, while 21-inchers come on the Platinum. A two-tone paint job can be specified for the Platinum, as well, with a black roof over the body color accentuating the chrome flowing strip. There are other good-looking vehicles in this premium two-row crossover class (looking right at you, Toyota Crown Signia), but the Murano skews more dramatic than any of them. This is what we thought cars of 2025 would look like back when the original Murano was introduced in 2003, and Nissan nailed the look.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNew Power, New Skills\n\nBut Nissan didn’t just stop at a tuck and trim with the sheet metal. It thoroughly reworked the chassis and powertrain, borrowing some bits from the Pathfinder, carrying over a couple of pieces from the old Murano, and adding in a bunch of refinements and new equipment. First and foremost is the replacement of the old V-6 with a new variable-compression turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 241 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. This is plenty of grunt to get the Murano moving smartly, and acceleration is one of the new SUV’s high points. Pop the D-Mode drive mode selector switch into Sport, and the Murano is transformed.\n\nYou might not think of a Murano as a sporty vehicle, and normally it’s not — put in Standard drive mode, it’s quiet, comfortable and smooth. But in Sport, it’s athletic, entertaining and genuinely fun to drive. The new nine-speed automatic transmission is beautifully tuned to keep the engine in its torquey sweet spot, allowing for curvy road athletics that previous Muranos protested. Powering out of corners is a treat, and downshifts are smooth and predictable on deceleration into a bend. You won’t want to keep it in Sport mode all the time, however, as it does keep a lower gear in normal operation, meaning the engine is revving higher than it needs to be for normal driving. But if you come upon some twisty paths, man, just go for it. Nissan did a great job making the Murano fun to drive.\n\nAnother part is the new electric power steering. It provides direct, accurate steering feel with sufficient feedback to help you place the Murano right where you want it in a bend. And while the suspension is on the softer side to allow for a more comfortable, luxurious cruising experience, it doesn’t make anyone ill with wallowy body behavior in spirited driving. Want your Murano to be a cushy luxe cruiser? It’ll do that just fine. Want to have a little fun on the way down from the mountains to dinner? It’ll do that, too, much more adeptly than its competitors do.\n\nUpgraded Insides, But Tight in Back\n\nThe Murano enjoys a completely redone interior that also bears more than a passing resemblance to the Ariya, but there are distinctive differences. The Murano feels much more upscale, frankly, with more genuine leather covering the seats, doors, dashboard and console. It also shares the same touch-sensitive climate controls integrated into the fake wood panel (nothing advertises that the wood is fake quite like backlit touch-sensitive “buttons” embedded smack in the middle of it), which we’re not huge fans of. The twin 12.3-inch displays atop the dashboard are more artfully integrated into the dashboard than many competitors’ displays, which often look like someone stapled iPads to the firewall; the Murano’s are hooded with nicely leather-wrapped decor, which makes them less offensive and more nicely designed.\n\nThe front seats look fantastic in the Platinum trim, with gorgeous two-tone upholstery and quilting patterns that are attractive. Visibility out is just OK, however, as the Murano’s dashboard and windows are rather high, giving the feeling of being in a tub of an interior. The rear window is squat due to the swoopy roofline, which makes the omission of a digital rearview mirror camera rather odd, especially since it’s offered in other Nissan products.\n\nThe Bose premium audio system sounds pretty dynamite, and there’s a ton of safety technology included, as well. Optional camera systems provide surround-view options, including an Invisible Hood View feature that lets you see what you’re about to roll over. That’s more useful for off-roading, but the front “around-the-corner” cameras are handy for tight urban environments, where blind corners can be a common obstacle. You can even geotag locations where you’d like those corner cameras to automatically pop on if you routinely drive through an area where visibility is limited.\n\nNot all is perfect in the Murano, however, and it mostly centers around that backseat. Legroom is tighter than a lot of competitors, and the seat bottom cushion is both low and firm, causing backseat passengers to be put into a knees-up position on an uncomfortable bench that isn’t all that pleasant for longer trips. Given the Murano is now being marketed as a more premium product for older buyers who might infrequently have kids or additional passengers riding in the back, however, this might not be a deal killer for a lot of customers. Cargo room doesn’t seem to suffer much in the Murano, but it doesn’t quite have the room of SUV competitors with more upright profiles, like the Crown Signia or Honda Passport.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Nissan Murano Up Close: Modernized Murano\n2024 Los Angeles Auto Show: Winners and Losers\n2025 Nissan Armada Review: Nissan Builds a Replacement Toyota Land Cruiser\nResearch the Nissan Murano\nShop for a New Nissan Murano for Sale Near You\nMeant for a Specific Buyer\n\nWith a starting price of about $42,000 (including destination), the Murano slots in decidedly above the less expensive Rogue. Nearly all content is divided up between the three trim levels (SV, SL and Platinum); pick the one that corresponds with the level of features you desire (or can afford). Front-wheel drive is standard on the SV, with all-wheel drive a $1,000 option; AWD is standard on the SL and Platinum. The range tops out with the Platinum at just under $51,000, which is less than you’ll pay for a loaded Crown Signia — but you also don’t get the Toyota’s hybrid engine.\n\nWith pricing and positioning like this, the Murano is less of a family crossover and more of a personal luxury one. It certainly has the style and performance to fill that role, leaving the Rogue to more mundane family duty. It makes the Murano a more aspirational purchase, and one that should successfully satisfy buyers looking for something a bit more special.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I’m actually kind of excited to hear that I’ll be driving the 2007 Nissan Armada. I love the name. I don’t recall having driven a vehicle with a title so appropriate, as this truck is supremely large. I enjoy spending time in a larger SUV, it’s kind of like going to stay with someone whose house is bigger than yours: it’s nice to spread out, but I wouldn’t want to clean it. Or pay for it. So in that sense, I really enjoyed the Armada for the week I drove it.\n\nThe Armada is so huge and it looks like a house from the 70’s with a not-so-well-thought-out addition on the back. Nissan calls this design feature “a bold dip near the rear door.” I call it ugly. To-may-toes, to-mot-toes. It is a long SUV with three rows and tons of cargo space.\n\nA huge plus for the Armada is how easy it is for my kids to get in (with the exception of the ridiculously high placed exterior door handles which my children won’t be able to reach until they’re in college). With the aid of running boards, the kiddos can hop right in and make themselves at home, negating the tall step-in height. There is a purely utilitarian aspect of the Armada that is fab-o for the following reasons: I don’t stress too much when the seats get kicked with slushy, muddy boots because it wipes right off; the all-season floor mats are fabulously skilled at hiding dirt and muck, they look clean throughout my entire test drive; and the second row is so wide I can fit three kids comfortably (one in a big convertible car seat, two in boosters that have armrests and cup holders).\n\nSpeaking of utilitarianism, the squariness of the interior lends itself more to the tank-driving types than the luxury-car driving types. I know squariness isn’t a word, but it should be, and it perfectly describes the design of the inside of the Armada. All surfaces are rectangular or square. Not a curve in the joint. And the dark charcoal leather makes things feel a little cold. So it isn’t the homiest ride, but it is easy to keep clean and tolerate dirty when cleanliness is not an option (which is more often the case in this mom-reviewer’s life).\n\nAfter weeks of snow, the Armada shrugs off the huge piles of it amassed on my street, and comfortably handles the sketchy roads. It’s not jarring me around, which my cup holders full of various beverages and I appreciate.\n\nWho can argue with utilitarianism when it’s an SUV we’re discussing? I mean, shouldn’t we give props to Nissan for making a true SUV in the Armada? The towing capacity on the Armada is abundant, up to 9,100 pounds. Nissan is very proud of this and there are all kinds of mentions of towing in the manual. The amount of cargo space is enormous. I proudly carry 5 people in the first two rows very comfortably, which allows 56.7 cubic feet of cargo space. In case you were wondering, that’s a lot. Even with the third row up, I have 20 cubic feet of cargo space, enough room to store some gear while running a gaggle of kids to the museum. Six cargo hooks are quite useful in case one of the kids won’t do as I say and I need to tie him down (don’t call child services on me, I’m just joking -honestly, I am). Lucky for me, the Armada has a power tailgate, a fantastic feature that can hypnotize me into buying any car that has it. Adding to the functionality of the Armada are 10 cup holders and four bottle holders. Phew, that’s a lot of functionality, people!\n\nAside from all the talk of function however, it must be mentioned that the Armada has a safety issue. In NHTSA’s rollover test, the Armada scored 3 stars out of 5. What this means to you is that the Armada has over a 20% chance of rolling over in a single-vehicle crash. The Armada was not rated in the Side Crash test, and in the Frontal Crash test scored 4 stars for the driver and 5 for the passenger. In any case, Nissan compensates with standard curtain airbags for all rows (including the third).\n\nAll in all, the Nissan Armada puts some “fun” in functional. It’s a big truck with lots of accompanying trucky features. It makes a functional family vehicle in spite of the not-so-cozy feel. This reviewer loves the way the Armada handles real life mess, snow and slop with ease. It’s quite possibly perfect for your little armada.\n\n*For more information on the 2007 Nissan Armada SE and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 5\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7/8\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Nissan Murano is a rugged yet refined crossover. Last year, I reviewed the 2009 Murano LE and was impressed by the top-of-the-line crossover’s interior finish. What struck me about the midlevel 2010 Murano SL was its powerful engine and its masculine looks.\n\nThere’s no sluggishness in the V-6 engine. The 2010 Murano was explosive as I accelerated on highway on-ramps. It also had solid braking to accentuate its sporty personality.\n\nI often describe my two boys as, “all boy, not an ounce of sugar or spice, just a bunch of frogs ‘n’ snails and puppy-dog-tails,” and I’d have to say the same about the Murano.  It’s masculine looking with no soft details. I can’t say it thrilled me.\n\nThe Murano starts at $28,340 and tops out at $38,710. My test car, an SL with all-wheel drive, cost $33,000.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhile the Murano’s performance was great, I wasn’t a fan of its tough-guy looks. I can appreciate its sporty touches such as fog lights and a grille that looks like an eagle in flight, but it wouldn’t turn my head out on the road.\n\n\n\nThe Murano’s step-in height was comfortable for me, and my kids were able to get in pretty easily; however, we would’ve benefited from a wider door opening in the second row.\n\nIn the back, I was disappointed that the Murano SL didn’t have a power liftgate with auto-close button. I hate touching the cargo door.  A power liftgate is available as part of the Technology Package ($1,500), which includes bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, heated side mirrors and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nI found the under-floor storage in the cargo area disappointing, too.  There’s a large, square outline on the floor, which is obviously hiding a storage compartment with great potential, based on the side of the outline.  When you lift the floor piece, the storage area is tiny and not very deep. I couldn’t fathom what I might store in there.  It certainly wasn’t deep enough to hold an emergency kit of any kind, but an ice scraper would fit back there.\n\nDriving the Murano, with its 265-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, made me temporarily forget about my cargo-area complaints. However, I had a few complaints when it was time to hit the gas station. The Murano gets an EPA-estimated 18/23 mpg city/highway and takes premium gas, which made trips to the gas station frequent and costly.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Murano’s interior left me unimpressed. It was as if Nissan had packed all of the Murano’s intrigue and personality into that amazing engine and just left it at that.\n\n\n\nThe interior is dark with faux-metal trim that has an overly masculine feel to it. My midlevel trim test car didn’t have some of the nicer features such as automatic headlamps and heated seats, which are available in the Leather Package ($1,600) and you’d expect to find at this price. The Murano has dual-zone air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel and illuminated vanity mirrors, but I wanted more. An optional Bose sound system upped the luxury ante slightly in my test car, but for the most part I was wishing I had the 2009 Murano back.\n\nThe Murano’s dark interior showed every speck of dirt that my kids dragged in. I felt the need to vacuum it on the very first day of my test drive. However, I was able to control these crazy urges; I’m no novice.\nThis five-seater had plenty of cupholders and cubbies for storing all of my kids’ gear. My boys found the backseat to be roomy, and I appreciated the second row’s reclining seatbacks.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2010 Murano received the top score of Good in front, side and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In past years, these scores, along with standard stability control, would earn it Top Safety Pick status. For 2010, IIHS added a new roof-strength crash test. The Murano received a rating of Marginal in this crash test, which took it out of Top Safety Pick contention.\n\nI ran into some problems when trying to install my sons’ booster seats using the Latch anchors. The lower anchors are buried under the seat cushions, but I was able to find them with my fingertips. The inner anchors sat above the seat belt buckles, which is an obstacle a parent doesn’t need when installing a child-safety seat. I had a hard time installing the Latch connectors because of this, and my youngest couldn’t buckle up by himself. Frankly, I had a hard time, too, when I tried to buckle him in.\n\nThere’s enough room in the backseat to accommodate a rear-facing infant-safety seat or a rear-facing convertible seat. A forward-facing convertible should fit without any problems because the second row’s seatbacks recline, which gives the car seats a better fit.\n\nThe Murano has standard antilock brakes, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact and side curtains for both rows. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Murano here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Nissan Murano is a mid-size SUV with seating for five in two rows. Three trim levels are available, all powered by a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and competitors include the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorento and Toyota Venza.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Murano’s base S trim is discontinued, and the SL now includes a standard power panoramic moonroof. The 2024 model year is expected to be the last for the current-generation Murano, which debuted for 2015. A new-generation Murano is in the works and will likely debut soon, probably as a 2025 model.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Nissan Murano Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nLED headlights\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLeatherette seats\nHeated front seats\nRemote start\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels (satin black optional)\nPanoramic moonroof\nMidnight Edition Package with black trim\nMatte wood trim\nLeather seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBose premium stereo with 11 speakers\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nHands-free power liftgate\nAll-wheel drive\nShould I Buy the 2024 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Murano is showing its age, but it’s still a decent choice if you’re looking for an SUV that delivers big on style. Its concept-car design still looks good almost a decade into its run, though its shape sacrifices some cargo capacity and inhibits visibility. Steering is light, and suspension motions are smooth, but the Murano focuses more on comfort than sporty handling. Considering its smooth and strong powertrain, long list of safety features, upscale interior and comfortable accommodations for five, Nissan’s mid-size SUV is worth a look — but check out the competition, too.",

      "expert_review": "I love chocolate and I have no problem telling the world. I’m thrilled to hear about the newest studies linking chocolate to strong emotional and physical wellbeing. When popping a piece into my mouth I simply feel good. It’s an indulgent treat that stimulates the secretion of endorphins, lowers my chance of cancer, and lowers my blood pressure. I don’t have to sacrifice decadence for health.\n\nDriving the 2005 Nissan Murano feels almost as good as eating chocolate. I don’t have to sacrifice form for function. I look forward to my daily treat of driving the Murano as much as I look forward to a piece of chocolate after dinner.\n\nThe adjustable foot pedals in the Murano make it easy to tailor a seating configuration to fit all drivers in my family. I’m able to move the pedals to me rather than moving myself to the pedals. This is also great from a safety standpoint; the farther away I am from the steering wheel and airbag, the less risk of injury during an airbag deployment. A 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat is standard equipment on my test vehicle (the SE version).\n\nThe low entry height of the Nissan Murano means that both of my children can climb in without help. It’s also positioned just right for me to elegantly slide my derrière into the driver’s seat.\n\nDespite its apparently compact body size, the Murano has cargo space to spare. My stroller, that’s quickly becoming nothing more than a purse carrier, lives in harmony with garden supplies, groceries, and my husband’s sweaty triathlon gear (don’t worry, I keep the produce separated from the sweat).\n\nWhen I need extra cargo space and I’m not lugging children around (don’t ask me when that’d be, ’cause I simply can’t give an example of when I’m not with child), the seats fold as easy as pie with the help of a little latch located near the cargo door. They also fold by using a pull tab located on the seat itself.\n\nJust like chocolate, the 2005 Nissan Murano has its downside. It’s not the fat content, so, what is the downside to the Murano? Well, it seats a total of five people and I can only fit two child car seats in it, so it’s not a carpooler’s dream. And, like many vehicles driven lately, I’m not thrilled about the center rear seatbelt that comes down from the ceiling.\n\nA recent study performed by Strategic Vision offers statistical proof that I’m not alone in my sense of chocolate-induced nirvana while driving this car. The 2005 Nissan Murano (along with five other Nissans) received the highest overall score when rating owners’ emotional response to their Murano and any problems experienced with it.\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Murano and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On",

      "expert_review": "I love the way this vehicle looks. The marketing term Nissan coined to describe it is “The Urban SUV.” It’s sleek, modern and sophisticated. Not everyone sees it the way I do, however. A friend of mine commented that its shape is reminiscent of a shoe. I don’t agree with her about that, but considering the fact that I spend so much time in my car, I think I might qualify as the little old lady who lived in a shoe.\n\nThe interior of my test vehicle came with standard cloth seats. I’m typically not a fan of cloth seats (mainly because they’re too difficult to clean), and these ones are no exception. They do, however, look great. These seats look and feel like suede. A leaky sippy cup in the backseat, though, and my lovely faux suede could be ruined.\n\nThe first great feature I notice on the Murano is the seat release latch in the cargo area. When I come across a really great bargain at a garage sale, all I have to do to make room for it is pull the lever and the rear seat immediately folds flat to the floor. No mussing or fussing. Simple and easy to use – just the way I like it.\n\nAfter loading in my kids’ two car seats, I notice there definitely isn’t room for a third. An older child in a booster seat can be put in the center thanks to shoulder belts in all the seats. The rear seatback angle adjusts, making it easy to install car seats properly. If you’re much taller than 5-foot-2, you may have to watch your head and duck under the door jam when buckling in children.\n\nThe storage compartments on the 2004 Nissan Murano SL vary greatly depending on where you are in the cabin. The rear seats lack sufficient storage. The front of the cabin is a different story. The center console has a removable tray that in itself is a respectable size. Lifting it out I can stash a slew of things in the bottom of the console. This is a great place to store essential emergency items, such as goldfish crackers and Cheerios. The fact that the cup and coin holders between the driver and passenger seats can be closed up when not in use is a great feature. This way I can cover up my clutter and immediately have the illusion of a tidy car. The driver and passenger in-door storage pockets pop open for access to pens and gum wrappers that inevitably find their way to the bottom.\n\nThe driver’s seat in the Murano SL comes standard with 10-way power adjustments, including lumbar and pedal adjustments. I don’t have to crank the seat all the way forward to reach the pedals. I just sit back and move the pedals to me. With the seat adjusting in so many directions, I wish my vehicle had the optional memory system. As a busy mom, the last thing I want to do is fuss with the driver’s seat each time I get in the car.\n\nThe Murano doesn’t have too many extra features for families. That being said, this is my favorite test vehicle to date. I look forward to driving it each morning. It has a smooth, solid ride and a quiet cabin. It’s lower to the ground than most SUVs, making it easy for me and my children to get into. Consumer Reports gives it its highest overall rating of Excellent, which is second in its class to the Honda Pilot.\n\nI definitely recommend the 2004 Nissan Murano SL. I wasn’t able to use it for carpooling, but driving this Urban SUV transported me to a level of calm and bliss that’s frequently elusive in motherhood. Which would you rather have: A minivan full of school children, or a sleek Urban SUV that makes driving feel meditative?\n\n*For more information on the Nissan Murano and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "If events of the last several months have taught automakers anything, one should be that big no longer is better.\n\nSo what were the Nissan stylists thinking when they redesigned the Murano crossover for 2009 and added bulgy fenders, hood and body panels and the impression this machine is packing more pounds than necessary?\n\nThe secret is to make a sport-utility or crossover look trim and fit to reduce the impression it’s a gulper.\n\nWe tested the all-wheel-drive ’09 Murano SL powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 that packs a 265-horsepower punch to leave the light briskly and to take steep inclines without sucking air. It’s rated at 18 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway, but what price AWD security?\n\nWith gas down to $1.74 a gallon, a price at which some Chevy Tahoe, Ford Expedition and Nissan Armada owners are venturing out again in daylight, few people shook heads or wagged fingers at our Murano.\n\nNice power from the V-6 that’s teamed with a continuously variable, or CVT, automatic with infinite gear ratios. It glides into traffic smoothly yet energetically and can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nBut a hybrid version that uses batteries to get going and pass to reduce the load on the gas engine would help the mileage-and score points for political correctness. Nothing on the immediate horizon, however.\n\nThe V-6 does deserve kudos for quiet operation, considered a sign of quality.\n\nMurano also offers stability control and traction control plus side-curtain air bags as standard. Handling is secure and road manners above average for a vehicle that looks a bit bloated thus prone to wander on the road and lean in corners. Press the AWD lock button, and it’s as if you’d Super Glued the 18-inch, all-season radials to the road. But there’s no AWD low setting so forget any serious off-road adventuring.\n\nRide is pleasant and seats well cushioned and supportive. The rear seat holds two or three and backs recline to create ample room and comfort. If you need to hold more packages than people, a pull cord lowers seat backs but not totally flush with the floor.\n\nUnder-floor compartments-one for the spare tire, one for the jack, one for tools or sports gear and one for papers or slim books-make the cargo hold very spacious. It also has power plug in the wall and release handles to drop rear seat backs.\n\nCouple gripes. One is that the “A” pillars along the windshield are too big and obstruct vision. Add the wiper-sweep pattern that piles snow against the passenger side pillar, reducing visibility by about a foot.\n\nThe dash top is huge for the impression there’s lots of room between you and anything ahead, but you’ll have to swirl one of the kids around on it to wipe the expanse.\n\nAnd while heated, leather seats are a Snow Belt pleasure, Lucifer must have had a hand in these because they toast the buns in a couple seconds.\n\nThanks to Nissan for a small covered container in the center console for cell phone or I-Pass, but why does the cover open toward the driver, making it difficult to see or reach inside?\n\nNot only is the rear window small and somewhat oval, it’s also slanted, further limiting vision. Finally, the large wheelwells protrude into the door openings in back. So much for graceful entry and exit.\n\nNice touches include iPod port and available Bluetooth phone, a stowage bin with power plug under the front center armrest large enough to hold a small purse and a glove box so huge your boxing gloves would fit.\n\nThough mileage is nothing special, you can monitor it from past to current average and to real-time usage. Though you have to master the information center to get these numbers, you don’t need graphics to tell you mileage hovers around 10 m.p.g. or less when you leap from the light or climb a hill, and shoots to 30 m.p.g. when you coast.\n\nThat screen also shows the view from the backup camera.\n\nBase price of the Murano SL with AWD is $29,480. Leather and heated seats added $1,600; a premium package that includes a Bose audio system with nine speakers, XM satellite radio, roof rails and rear-view camera goes for $1,000.\n\nThe Murano had no navi system so we had to rely on experience and the wife to know where we were at all times. The $2,000 saved would buy a paper map, plus a lot of gas at $1.74 or $4 a gallon.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides. Contact him at rides@tribune.com.",

      "expert_review": "Gas price instability and the economic downturn got shoppers rethinking how much SUV they really need, with most deciding a compact SUV was enough. Consumers with a few kids, who needed more room, chose a three-row crossover. That left the midsize, five-seat SUV body-type an unwanted commodity by most.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Nissan Murano is a quiet, comfortable, roomy five-seat SUV, perfectly executed for empty-nesters or others who prize a spacious cabin and cargo area, but who have no desire for a third row, where kids routinely wind up.\n\nThere may not be much excitement in the Murano driving experience, but these shoppers want a solid road-trip vehicle, not a rally car.\n\nI tested a variety of Murano trim levels, specs and powertrain configurations around the mountain roads and highways of northern California. Compare the 2015 and 2014 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile the Nissan Murano delivers on the practicality and electronic wizardry its target buyer may demand, its styling panders to folks who may be more daring than those shopping this mid-size segment.\n\nThe radical front end, with curvaceous fenders and a grille that drops down in a V pattern, is in-your-face to an extreme for the class. It makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee look stately and Ford’s upcoming Edge redesign look a bit staid in comparison.\n\nIt gets wilder farther down the profile, where the rear glass wraps around to the rear window creating a futuristic, solid-black look. The company did the same for the Quest minivan, with a less likable impact.\n\nEighteen-inch wheels are standard and look appropriately sized for the vehicle. The 20-inch wheels on the Platinum model seem a bit too big, visually, and I’m not a fan of their pattern, either, but there will likely be plenty of people who opt for them.\n\nThe wild styling also compromises visibility. One would presume rear visibility would be an issue, but even though there’s a blind spot over the driver’s right shoulder, the large side mirrors negate much worry there. Rather, I was more surprised by just how huge the A-pillar is where it meets the dashboard. It stretches a considerable way from the hood to the driver-side window, creating a large blind spot to the driver’s left. That means you could be blocked from seeing vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians when coming to an intersection; on my drive it blocked oncoming traffic when taking a tight looping turn to the left, where I should have been able to see cars approaching my side of the car.\n\nHow It Drives\nAs in the popular Maxima, Nissan’s venerable 3.5-liter V-6 remains the workhorse under the hood, producing 260 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of torque. It’s teamed to a continuously variable automatic transmission that uses artificial shift points to make it seem like a traditional automatic. The experience feels more CVT than automatic, but power comes on fast and won’t leave drivers wanting much, whether the engine is mated to front-wheel or all-wheel drive (AWD).\n\nThe brakes are also solidly predictable, and when it’s running on its standard 18-inch wheels and tires, the Nissan Murano is one of the smoothest non-luxury SUVs I’ve driven. Mileage is only average, however, at 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined for both front- and all-wheel-drive versions. A V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee gets identical mileage with AWD and 22/30/25 mpg with rear-wheel drive. The AWD-only Outback gets 20/27/22 mpg when equipped with a V-6 engine. Compare them here.\n\nWhere the Murano faltered in my eyes was in its surprisingly relaxed steering response. You have to turn the wheel considerably more than you would expect to get the desired reaction. This was apparent on two cars I tested with the 18-inch wheels — one front- and one AWD. My co-driver agreed with the assessment and was equally unimpressed.\n\nMoving to a Platinum model with 20-inch wheels and AWD, the steering sharpened up and reacted in a more responsive manner. Those wheels, though, impact the Murano’s superbly comfortable ride, resulting in a just-kind-of-comfortable ride with increased road noise and sharper reactions to road imperfections.\n\nOtherwise, the Nissan Murano cabin is as quiet as can be. After driving up the Pacific coast in a rainstorm that made national news, I pulled over to take some pictures on a bluff and was almost knocked over by the high winds. In the car, I hadn’t even noticed those winds — upward of 50 mph — because the cabin was so quiet. The car also didn’t suffer many, if any, effects of wind buffeting, which is remarkable.\n\nInterior\nIn the past, Nissan has made a few interiors that felt close to its Infiniti luxury brand, and the Murano follows suit. In its highest, Platinum, trim, which offers a dark brown leather interior, there are few areas that distinguish it from an Infiniti. That’s good, because the Platinum starts at $39,885, including a destination charge.\n\nEven on the more accessible SV trim, at $33,505, there are still swaths of leather everywhere from above the gauge cluster to on the armrests on the doors. Even if you’re sitting in a cloth driver’s seat, you’re seeing and touching leather.\n\nBoth the front and rear outboard seats are what Nissan calls Zero Gravity seats. I’ve been a fan of these in the Altima sedan — though a few other Cars.com editors are not — and I thought they were incredibly comfortable in the Murano, as well. The cloth versions don’t have as much lumbar support as the leather, and the passenger seats don’t have height adjustment, but my driving partner and I thought they were quite pleasant after a three-hour haul from Napa to the coast and back.\n\nSpace is considerable in the backseat, which Nissan expects to be used for adults on a double date, not preteens being shuttled to soccer practice. The outboard seats are also Zero Gravity types, and on the Platinum trim they’re also heated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nNissan should get an award for its center console, a near-perfect mix of physical buttons — I counted 17 — four knobs and a touch-screen. Buttons are either piano black with illuminated text and icons, or chrome-covered plastic with the labels above.\n\nThe 8-inch touch-screen — standard on SV trims and higher — has terrific resolution and has been completely rethought from the previous generation of Nissan systems, which I always found easy to use. Luckily, everything is still laid out in a straightforward way that should cause few headaches for the tech-averse.\n\nThere are separate screens for music, navigation and various other functions, as well as a home screen that gives brief glimpses of many systems that are active. However, I found that screen to look a bit unfinished compared with the competition.\n\nThe base stereo has good sound, and you can connect two devices via USB — one for front passengers and one for rear. Either can pipe music through the car’s stereo.\n\nAn upgraded Bose stereo is optional on SV trims and standard on SL and Platinum versions. I was a bit shocked to discover how poor this system sounded and my co-driver agreed. There was no frequency range in the music; it all seemed to be midrange, with not much treble and even less bass. And nearly all the sound was coming from the five speakers arrayed on top of the dash. There were only basic sound settings, and nothing significantly altered this distasteful aural experience. In reality, the base stereo sounded significantly better.\n\nCargo & Storage\nFor an interior as spacious as the Nissan Murano’s, there could be more storage for front occupants. There’s a nice covered tray between the cupholders and a cubby in the center console that can do duty as a smartphone bin; otherwise, the driver will have to rely on the door pocket to stash frequently used items like loose change and other miscellaneous things. The cubby under the armrest itself is a decent size, but it’s not as cavernous as others in the class.\n\nThere’s also a small tray behind the cubby for rear passengers to put items, namely smartphones, into, because the rear USB ports are directly beneath it. It’s difficult to tell if it will be used in such a manner in real life. I tend to clench my phone when in a backseat in fear of forgetting it’s on my lap and dropping it when I get out.\n\nA generous cargo area is another benefit of moving up to an SUV this size. At 39.6 cubic feet, the Murano doesn’t disappoint, providing plenty of room for four good-size pieces of luggage or a mix of luggage and golf bags. The Jeep Grand Cherokee, Subaru Outback and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport pack slightly smaller dimensions at 36.3, 35.5 and 35.4 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nThe split-bench rear seats fold flat via auto-latch release handles by the liftgate, a feature I’ve always appreciated; this expands cargo room to 69.9 cubic feet. This is ahead of the Grand Cherokee’s 68.3 but behind the 73.3 cubic feet in the Outback and 71.5 cubic feet in the Santa Fe Sport.\n\nSafety\nA backup camera is standard on the Murano, while Nissan’s Around View Monitor is standard on SL and Platinum trims. When activated, it offers a bird’s-eye view of the SUV by using cameras in front, back and in the side mirrors. It’s a feature I’ve always appreciated due to my home’s very narrow side driveway leading to my garage.\n\nBlind spot warning is standard on SL and Platinum trims, as is a system to detect objects moving behind the car, called Moving Object Detection, and rear cross-traffic alert. Intelligent cruise control, forward collision warning and forward emergency braking are part of an optional Technology Package on those two trims, as well. See all the Murano’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDespite the issues I uncovered in terms of steering and the stereo, the Nissan Murano is a remarkable all-around SUV that delivers on two aspects I’ve always said mattered to the mainstream car shopper: comfort and space.\n\nHowever, starting at $30,445, including a destination charge, it’s more closely priced to the Jeep Grand Cherokee than the Outback or Santa Fe Sport, which can be had at their top trim levels for around $34,000. For 2015, the Murano adds that new top trim level, Platinum, for $39,885 with plenty of bells and whistles. Ford will field a redesigned Edge in the spring, but pricing hasn’t been announced yet.\n\nThere’s a happy medium or two in the Nissan Murano lineup for shoppers looking to spend between $33,000 and $35,000, but the competition’s more traditional looks and lower prices may pose a problem for Nissan’s new SUV.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Nissan Murano is a mid-size SUV with room for five in two rows. Four trim levels are available, and all are powered by a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe and Honda Passport.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Murano was refreshed last year, and for 2020 some trim levels get more safety and convenience features. SV, SL and Platinum trim levels come with Nissan Safety Shield 360, which includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights and rear automatic braking. The SV trim now includes heated side mirrors, adaptive cruise control and rear parking sensors. Meanwhile, the SL trim gets traffic-sign recognition capability.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Nissan Murano Are Most Important?\n\nThe available Nissan Safety Shield 360 adds important active safety features, and all trim levels have forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A standard 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Navigation is available on higher trims.\n\n2020 Nissan Murano Vs. 2020 Ford Edge: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Murano and Edge are solid choices for small families, with seating for five and roomy rear seats. Both also deliver a certain amount of style, with more rakish looks than some mid-size SUVs. The Murano has the nicer interior of the two, with a more upscale look and feel. Plus, the Murano’s strong V-6 engine contributes to its more refined standard powertrain.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Nissan Murano?\n\nThe Murano is a good choice if you’re looking for an SUV that delivers big on style. Its concept-car design theme still looks good several years into its run, even if it sacrifices some cargo capacity for the shape. But with its smooth and strong powertrain, long list of available safety features, upscale interior and comfortable accommodations for five, the Murano is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2015 about the 2015 Nissan Murano. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nGas price instability and the economic downturn got shoppers rethinking how much SUV they really need, with most deciding a compact SUV was enough. Consumers with a few kids, who needed more room, chose a three-row crossover. That left the midsize, five-seat SUV an unwanted commodity by most.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Nissan Murano is a quiet, comfortable, roomy five-seat SUV, perfectly executed for empty-nesters or others who prize a spacious cabin and cargo area, but who have no desire for a third row, where kids routinely wind up.\n\nThere may not be much excitement in the Murano driving experience, but these shoppers want a solid road-trip vehicle, not a rally car.\n\nI tested a variety of Murano trim levels and powertrain configurations around the mountain roads and highways of northern California. Compare the 2015 and 2014 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile the Murano delivers on the practicality and electronic wizardry its target buyer may demand, its styling panders to folks who may be more daring than those shopping this segment.\n\nThe radical front end, with curvaceous fenders and a grille that drops down in a V pattern, is in-your-face to an extreme for the class. It makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee look stately and Ford’s upcoming Edge redesign look a bit staid in comparison.\n\nIt gets wilder farther down the profile, where the rear glass wraps around to the rear window creating a futuristic, solid-black look. The company did the same for the Quest minivan, with a less likable impact.\n\nEighteen-inch wheels are standard and look appropriately sized for the vehicle. The 20-inch wheels on the Platinum model seem a bit too big, visually, and I’m not a fan of their pattern, either, but there will likely be plenty of people who opt for them.\n\nThe wild styling also compromises visibility. One would presume rear visibility would be an issue, but even though there’s a blind spot over the driver’s right shoulder, the large side mirrors negate much worry there. Rather, I was more surprised by just how huge the A-pillar is where it meets the dashboard. It stretches a considerable way from the hood to the driver-side window, creating a large blind spot to the driver’s left. That means you could be blocked from seeing vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians when coming to an intersection; on my drive it blocked oncoming traffic when taking a tight looping turn to the left, where I should have been able to see cars approaching my side of the car.\n\nHow It Drives\nNissan’s venerable 3.5-liter V-6 remains the workhorse under the hood, producing 260 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of torque. It’s teamed to a continuously variable automatic transmission that uses artificial shift points to make it seem like a traditional automatic. The experience feels more CVT than automatic, but power comes on fast and won’t leave drivers wanting much, whether the engine is mated to front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nThe brakes are also solidly predictable, and when it’s running on its standard 18-inch wheels and tires, the Murano is one of the smoothest non-luxury SUVs I’ve driven. Mileage is only average, however, at 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined for both front- and all-wheel-drive versions. A V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee gets identical mileage with all-wheel drive and 22/30/25 mpg with rear-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive-only Outback gets 20/27/22 mpg when equipped with a V-6 engine. Compare them here.\n\nWhere the Murano faltered in my eyes was in its surprisingly relaxed steering response. You have to turn the wheel considerably more than you would expect to get the desired reaction. This was apparent on two cars I tested with the 18-inch wheels — one front- and one all-wheel drive. My co-driver agreed with the assessment and was equally unimpressed.\n\nMoving to a Platinum model with 20-inch wheels and all-wheel drive, the steering sharpened up and reacted in a more responsive manner. Those wheels, though, impact the Murano’s superbly comfortable ride, resulting in a just-kind-of-comfortable ride with increased road noise and sharper reactions to road imperfections.\n\nOtherwise, the Murano cabin is as quiet as can be. After driving up the Pacific coast in a rainstorm that made national news, I pulled over to take some pictures on a bluff and was almost knocked over by the high winds. In the car, I hadn’t even noticed those winds — upward of 50 mph — because the cabin was so quiet. The car also didn’t suffer many, if any, effects of wind buffeting, which is remarkable.\n\nInterior\nIn the past, Nissan has made a few interiors that felt close to its Infiniti luxury brand, and the Murano follows suit. In its highest, Platinum, trim, which offers a dark brown leather interior, there are few areas that distinguish it from an Infiniti. That’s good, because the Platinum starts at $39,885, including a destination charge.\n\nEven on the more accessible SV trim, at $33,505, there are still swaths of leather everywhere from above the gauge cluster to on the armrests on the doors. Even if you’re sitting in a cloth driver’s seat, you’re seeing and touching leather.\n\nBoth the front and rear outboard seats are what Nissan calls Zero Gravity seats. I’ve been a fan of these in the Altima sedan — though a few other Cars.com editors are not — and I thought they were incredibly comfortable in the Murano, as well. The cloth versions don’t have as much lumbar support as the leather, and the passenger seats don’t have height adjustment, but my driving partner and I thought they were quite pleasant after a three-hour haul from Napa to the coast and back.\n\nSpace is considerable in the backseat, which Nissan expects to be used for adults on a double date, not preteens being shuttled to soccer practice. The outboard seats are also Zero Gravity types, and on the Platinum trim they’re also heated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nNissan should get an award for its center console, a near-perfect mix of physical buttons — I counted 17 — four knobs and a touch-screen. Buttons are either piano black with illuminated text and icons, or chrome-covered plastic with the labels above.\n\nThe 8-inch touch-screen — standard on SV trims and higher — has terrific resolution and has been completely rethought from the previous generation of Nissan systems, which I always found easy to use. Luckily, everything is still laid out in a straightforward way that should cause few headaches for the tech-averse.\n\nThere are separate screens for music, navigation and various other functions, as well as a home screen that gives brief glimpses of many systems that are active. However, I found that screen to look a bit unfinished compared with the competition.\n\nThe base stereo has good sound, and you can connect two devices via USB — one for front passengers and one for rear. Either can pipe music through the car’s stereo.\n\nAn upgraded Bose stereo is optional on SV trims and standard on SL and Platinum versions. I was a bit shocked to discover how poor this system sounded and my co-driver agreed. There was no frequency range in the music; it all seemed to be midrange, with not much treble and even less bass. And nearly all the sound was coming from the five speakers arrayed on top of the dash. There were only basic sound settings, and nothing significantly altered this distasteful aural experience. In reality, the base stereo sounded significantly better.\n\nCargo & Storage\nFor an interior as spacious as the Murano’s, there could be more storage for front occupants. There’s a nice covered tray between the cupholders and a cubby in the center console that can do duty as a smartphone bin; otherwise, the driver will have to rely on the door pocket to stash frequently used items like loose change and other miscellaneous things. The cubby under the armrest itself is a decent size, but it’s not as cavernous as others in the class.\n\nThere’s also a small tray behind the cubby for rear passengers to put items, namely smartphones, into, because the rear USB ports are directly beneath it. It’s difficult to tell if it will be used in such a manner in real life. I tend to clench my phone when in a backseat in fear of forgetting it’s on my lap and dropping it when I get out.\n\nA generous cargo area is another benefit of moving up to an SUV this size. At 39.6 cubic feet, the Murano doesn’t disappoint, providing plenty of room for four good-size pieces of luggage or a mix of luggage and golf bags. The Jeep Grand Cherokee, Subaru Outback and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport pack slightly smaller dimensions at 36.3, 35.5 and 35.4 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nThe rear seats fold flat via release handles by the liftgate, a feature I’ve always appreciated; this expands cargo room to 69.9 cubic feet. This is ahead of the Grand Cherokee’s 68.3 but behind the 73.3 cubic feet in the Outback and 71.5 cubic feet in the Santa Fe Sport.\n\nSafety\nA backup camera is standard on the Murano, while Nissan’s Around View Monitor is standard on SL and Platinum trims. When activated, it offers a bird’s-eye view of the SUV by using cameras in front, back and in the side mirrors. It’s a feature I’ve always appreciated due to my home’s very narrow side driveway leading to my garage.\n\nBlind spot warning is standard on SL and Platinum trims, as is a system to detect objects moving behind the car, called Moving Object Detection, and rear cross-traffic alert. Intelligent cruise control, forward collision warning and forward emergency braking are part of an optional Technology Package on those two trims, as well. See all the Murano’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDespite the issues I uncovered in terms of steering and the stereo, the Murano is a remarkable all-around SUV that delivers on two aspects I’ve always said mattered to the mainstream car shopper: comfort and space.\n\nHowever, starting at $30,445, including a destination charge, it’s more closely priced to the Jeep Grand Cherokee than the Outback or Santa Fe Sport, which can be had at their top trim levels for around $34,000. For 2015, the Murano adds that new top trim level, Platinum, for $39,885 with plenty of bells and whistles. Ford will field a redesigned Edge in the spring, but pricing hasn’t been announced yet.\n\nThere’s a happy medium or two in the Murano lineup for shoppers looking to spend between $33,000 and $35,000, but the competition’s more traditional looks and lower prices may pose a problem for Nissan’s new SUV.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The aging 2013 Nissan Murano is a high-quality, comfortable SUV that struggles to compete with the value and fuel economy of fresher competitors.\n\nNissan’s current version of the Murano is five years running without significant changes, and that’s too long considering just about every other five-seat midsize SUV on the market has received a significant redesign in that segment. SUVs like the 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 2014 Kia Sorento now rival the Murano in areas where the Nissan previously triumphed, such as an interior that was nicer than anything else in the segment. Compare the Murano with its competitors here.\n\nStill, the Murano’s onetime greatness keeps it from being a complete dog even among brand-new SUVs. There’s still a lot to like in its sophisticated ride and leather-upholstered trim levels, which excel in offering a premium experience. Unfortunately, the cloth interior on base trims takes away much of the niceness, and it’s the only seating material offered until you get to the expensive SL trim level, which goes for $36,235, including destination charge. I tested a cloth-seated SV with all-wheel drive. Compare Murano trim levels here.\n\nThe Inside\nThe $37,770 as-tested price of our SV with cloth interior was out of line with what buyers can get for that money in competing models. There’s nothing wrong with the cloth seats, but a leather interior is expected at this kind of luxury-car price. The cloth proved extremely comfortable in both rows of seating, however. The deep cushions have superior levels of comfort, with support similar to what I would imagine a giant cloth baseball glove chair would offer.\n\nThe beige interior as a whole has a homey and welcoming vibe, though the Murano’s black interior is the classier choice and hides the aging design better. Competitors are catching up to the Murano’s near-Infiniti quality, which used to be unique in this segment. For similar or less money, the Grand Cherokee is classily appointed, with high-quality, soft-touch materials; the Sorento is available with Nappa leather seating; and the Santa Fe Sport offers luxurious saddle-colored leather that oozes personality and quality.\n\nThe Murano still has nice touches, like real aluminum interior trim. The interior style is more functional than eye-popping, with a traditional layout of controls. You’ll find high-quality knobs and easy-to-read buttons in the Murano rather than the hard-to-use capacitive touch buttons some automakers are adopting in order to give iPad-like usability … and save manufacturing money.\n\nCompetitors are catching up to the Murano in terms of roominess as well as interior quality. The Murano holds its own, with plenty of room for front and rear occupants. I could sprawl out in the backseat even with the front seat in my driving position. A nearly flat floor makes the interior feel extra roomy and gives ample legroom for a middle passenger. Those looking for maximum cargo room, though, may have to look elsewhere. The Murano’s 31.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat is less than the Grand Cherokee’s 35.1 cubic feet, the Santa Fe Sport’s 35.4 cubic feet and the Sorento’s 36.9 cubic feet. The seven-seat 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, which is priced similarly to the Murano and shares many of its driving and comfort characteristics, has more cargo room behind the sliding second-row seat (when the third row is folded), offering a maximum 47.8 cubic feet.\n\nQuick-release handles in the cargo area drop the Murano’s backseat flat with no effort. Frequent users will appreciate the quickness.\n\nFeatures & Technology\nOur near-$38,000 Murano included navigation, a V-6 engine, all-wheel drive, an optional Bose stereo and a power liftgate. It’s what isn’t present that seriously hurts the Murano’s value: no sunroof, no leather seats, no heated or cooled seats, no sliding second row and no blind-spot or lane-departure warning systems on trim levels below the $36,235 SL. Many of these features are available for the same price or less on competitors. The Murano’s features are well-executed. The 7-inch touch-screen, part of a $2,270 Value Package, is intuitive and has easy-to-read graphics, but it’s positioned too far forward to reach when driving. However, there is a center knob below the display that works well for controlling navigation and other menu functions when the touch-screen is out of reach. An impressive nine-speaker Bose stereo is part of that package, as is a power liftgate and streaming Bluetooth audio.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Murano is a guaranteed comfortable experience no matter where or how it’s driven. The Murano was far ahead of its time in offering a smooth, quiet, refined ride back when SUVs were more about utility and trucklike ride and handling, and its ride quality is just as impressive today. The Toyota Venza and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport are more athletic crossovers for those seeking a fun-to-drive option, while the Murano leans into corners like a big, comfy sedan. That’s not a huge knock, considering how refined and well-composed the Murano feels while cruising down the road.\n\nRefinement is the name of the game for the standard 3.5-liter V-6, which makes 260 horsepower. The continuously variable automatic transmission is perhaps the best version of this type, easily fooling drivers into thinking it’s a standard, fixed-gear transmission without the typically sloppy acceleration common to CVTs. Acceleration is effortless.\n\nWhat hurts the Murano is its EPA-estimated gas mileage at 18/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive and 18/24/20 mpg with front-wheel drive. Compared with the competition’s innovative technology, the Murano is lacking. Turbocharged four-cylinder engines, eight-speed automatic transmissions, Eco driving modes and diesel engines — none of which were commonplace when the Murano was last redesigned — often give the others an efficiency edge.\n\nA Hyundai Santa Fe Sport with its base engine and all-wheel drive is rated 20/26/22 mpg, and with front-wheel drive is 21/29/24 mpg. The Santa Fe Sport’s optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, closer to the Murano’s V-6 in power, still beats the Murano’s gas mileage: 19/24/21 mpg with all-wheel drive and 20/27/23 mpg with front-wheel drive. Unlike the Santa Fe, Sorento or Ford Edge, the Murano doesn’t have a more efficient engine choice. Even the larger Pathfinder is rated with better gas mileage than the Murano, at 19/25/21 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Murano got the top score of Good in front-, side- and rear-impact tests, but scored Marginal in a roof-strength test — below Good and Acceptable, but above Poor. Only one other model subjected to this test in the agency’s Midsize SUV class scored Marginal; two scored Acceptable and 17 earned Good scores.\n\nThe Murano received four out of five stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. Standard safety equipment includes front airbags, side-impact airbags for front occupants, side curtain airbags for front and rear seating, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes. See more safety features here, and see how well child-safety seats fit in the Murano in our Car Seat Check.\n\nIn the Market\nWhat the Murano lacks in value could easily be countered by a good deal. Despite its age, the Murano’s seating, ride comfort and roominess are exceptional. However, in addition to the competition that’s stepped up its game, the Nissan Pathfinder is similar to the Murano in price and offers more room and better gas mileage ratings. At its sticker price, there’s not enough value in the Murano’s feature content, cargo room or gas mileage, which are three biggies for crossover SUV shoppers.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Were George Jetson to buy a human transporter that touched the ground, the message from the dealership, upon delivery, would go something like this:\n\n&quot;Mr. Jetson, your SL AWD with Xtronic CVT, ABS, and Altima DNA with a dose of a 350 Z powerplant awaits your pickup. It is named Murano.&quot;\n\nYes, the Nissan Murano for 2003 is a car George Jetson would love. In it, he could carry in comfort not only his wife, Jane, daughter, Judy, his boy, Elroy, and their dog, Astro, but also Rosie, the household robot.\n\nNissan, a company on the ropes just a few years ago, has come back to center ring the way Ali rebounded in Zaire in 1974, reenergized with muscle and an edge. As always, the car maker continues to build remarkable V-6 engines two cylinders short of &#151; but with nearly equal power to &#151; many V-8s. And it retains a duality of design that I find intriguing.\n\nEven as it gave us Altimas and Maximas, it produced the Xterra, an affordable SUV that reached back from the softness of that evolving phenomenon to the washable interior, gear-hauling, play-with-it funkiness of original SUVs.\n\nAnd now, even as they give us stylish, subtle, updated versions of those Altimas and Maximas, Nissan’s designers give us an edgy new SUV that, at a remarkable price of about $30,000 gives much of the elegance, luxury, and performance of higher-priced competitors.\n\nAnd this even before Nissan launches its next entries in the truck/SUV market, the not-so-subtly named Titan Crew Cab and the Armada.\n\nThe Murano comes in two models, SL and SE, and is offered with either front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive. Prices range from just under $30,000 to an optioned-out $37,000.\n\nYou could say it’s just another entry in the crossover sport-ute/station wagon/van/truck niche, but with its quality at its price, it is an eye-opener. At these prices, George Jetson would save enough to give Rosie a raise.\n\nIts patterned grill, rounded up to the hood, looks like the toe of a sneaker, and its rise from hood to roofline to rising rear remind me of a Chuck Taylor All Star high top on wheels. Some will see it as a mistake (and the decision will, in fact, turn away some families) but Nissan opted to go for extra inside room rather than try to accommodate a third row of seating. The payoff is remarkable legroom front and rear. The rear seat will hold three adults in actual comfort and it folds flat, even with headrests still attached &#151; a nice, annoyance-eliminating touch. And even with a low roof line uncommon on today’s SUVs, headroom in the Murano is ample.\n\nUp front, well-bolstered seats grip driver and passenger even in hard cornering. The leather in the SL all-wheel-drive tested was smooth and tough at the same time. Aluminum trim on the arm rests, center control pod, center console, and gauge housing added an industrial touch to a refined interior.\n\nK nobs and buttons on the control pod were big, easy to use, and &#151; not always the case these days &#151; intuitive in use.\n\nI also liked the cubbies, nooks, crannies, and bins that seemed to be everywhere. Very utilitarian.\n\nBuilt on an altered Altima platform &#151; using the requisite car-based DNA, the Murano is powered by Nissan’s fabulous V-6 aluminum head, aluminum block engine. That’s the same powerplant that, in various tunings, drives the Altima, Pathfinder, Maxima, and hot 350 Z sports car. In the Murano it delivers 245 horsepower and a tugging 246 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nGetting one step ahead of Audi, which is headed in this direction, Nissan offers a continuously variable transmission (CVT) in its all-wheel-drive model. It uses a pair of convex pulleys and a belt to offer virtually unlimited gear ratios. Every time you touch the gas or let off on the gas, the pulleys open and close, the belt changes form and infinite &quot;gears&quot; are d livered. This means that going uphill, there is no constant, obvious clunking about for the right ratio as happens with regular automatic transmissions. Further, the engine and transmission work in amazing harmony during downhill compression braking and in sport mode when approaching corners at speed and letting up on the gas. I’d love to try this combo on a racetrack where the trick in cornering is to go in slow at the last possible moment and come out fast at the earliest controllable moment.\n\nAny time you try to cross breed automotive traits (in this case car and SUV) there is a tradeoff. Here, stable, flat cornering at high speed &#151; the result of a stiff suspension &#151; means some jolting over bumps. Unless you live where the roads are pocked everywhere, it’s a good tradeoff for that stability.\n\nIts suspension system, fully independent, includes struts, control arms, coil springs, and antiroll bar up front and, in the rear, control arms, diagonal and lateral links, coil springs, and another antiroll bar.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive model runs in front-wheel-drive under normal conditions, but ships as much as 50 percent of its power to the rear wheels if the rubber up front starts to slip. In addition, at speeds below 19 miles per hour, the driver can manually lock the electronic clutch that delivers power to the rear. That is not to mean, however, that this is a true off-road thumper. It sits only 7 inches off the ground and is meant to get you to the ski chalet or trout stream &#151; not over the rocks, stumps, and mud of logged-off hunting grounds.\n\nThe Murano rides on standard 18-inch wheels and is stopped suddenly and surely by disc brakes more than a foot in diameter.\n\nAt this price, this quality, this performance, I’d shop this car against far pricier models.\n\nNice touch: The automotive version of a binnacle that houses three gauges and seems to float out from, and above, the dashboard, behind the wheel &#151; a risky design that works.\n\nAnnoyance: All this, but a towing capacity of only 3,500 pounds. Much as I love this car, I couldn’t own it. I also own a boat that needs more &quot;tuggage&quot; (you won’t find that word in a dictionary) than that.",

      "expert_review": "Now on sale, the 2023 Nissan Murano returns largely unchanged as it continues to wait for a redesign. In addition to a pair of new paint colors and updated logos, the Murano sees a small price bump across all trims — it now starts at $34,955 for the base S model (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee).\n\nRelated: 2019 Nissan Murano Review: Updated and No Longer Up to Snuff\n\nSince our last review of the Murano in 2019, the two-row mid-size SUV saw only minor changes, the most notable being the expansion of Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 to all models in 2021. According to Automotive News, 2024 could finally bring substantial changes for the Murano, but the new model will likely come with a steeper price tag (when asked to confirm the redesign, a Nissan spokesperson did not provide further details).\n\nSee what the current Murano has to offer and its 2023 pricing below to decide if the impending redesign is worth waiting for.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nChanges for the 2023 Murano are limited to new Nissan logos inside and out along with two new exterior paint choices, Super Black and Deep Ocean Blue Pearl, which join Boulder Gray Pearl, Brilliant Silver Metallic, Gun Metallic, Pearl White TriCoat and Scarlet Ember Tintcoat. All models see a $350 price increase.\n\nPowertrain and Standard Features\n2023 Nissan Murano | Manufacturer image\n\nFound under the hood of all Murano models is a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. While the V-6 produces ample power for merging and passing on the highway, the CVT is the SUV’s Achilles heel due to its lack of responsiveness and selectable drive modes. All models come with standard front-wheel drive or available all-wheel drive and receive an EPA-rated 20/28/23 mpg (city/highway/combined).\n\nUnlike its CVT, the Murano’s suite of safety features falls into the category of things Cars.com editors did like. Safety Shield 360 bundles automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, reverse automatic braking and automatic high-beam assist. Adding to its safety scorecard, the 2022 Murano earned a Top Safety Pick Plus award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAdditionally, all models come with a standard 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, LED headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control and keyless access.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2023 Nissan Murano | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Murano returns with four trims for 2023: S, SV, SL and Platinum. Retailing for $1,590, a Midnight Edition Package available on the SV adds blackened exterior accents, 20-inch gloss-black wheels and illuminated kick plates; a moonroof can also be added to the SL model for an additional $1,490. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard on the S and SV, while 20-inch wheels are standard on higher trims.\n\nInside, S and SV models get cloth seats, and leather upholstery is found in the SL and Platinum; all models with the exception of the S get standard heated and ventilated seats. The SL and Platinum upgrade the standard six-speaker audio system to a premium 11-speaker Bose system and add built-in navigation with voice recognition.\n\nBelow are the starting prices for the 2023 Murano with standard FWD; AWD adds $1,700 across the board.\n\nS: $34,955\nSV: $38,495\nSL: $42,455\nPlatinum: $46,505\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe Murano’s mid-size SUV rivals include the Ford Edge, Honda Passport and Hyundai Santa Fe. In Cars.com’s 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge, the Murano fell mid-pack among its competitors, and it also lands in the middle for price: Currently, the 2022 Ford Edge starts at $39,440; the 2022 Honda Passport at $39,665; and the 2023 Hyundai Santa Fe at $29,495.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Nissan Murano: What’s Changed\nWhat’s the Best Mid-Size SUV of 2019?\nHere’s What the 2021 Nissan Murano Costs\n2019 Nissan Murano Dresses Up for New Competition\nResearch the 2023 Nissan Murano\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Nissan Murano made me feel at home in it. I used to drive a 2006 Murano, and in the 2011, there were some changes, but I was also happy with what hadn’t changed. There’s not a whole lot to improve upon with the 2011 Murano because it fits families well.\n\nThis five-passenger crossover is fun to drive, and it’s comfortable enough to be in all day long — even with the kids.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the Murano is its bold grille hasn’t changed. Nissan has found its happy place as far as the grille is concerned. That’s not to say that everyone will love the grille or the overall design for that matter, but that’s what happens when something is unique.\n\nOn the road, the Murano is nimble and sportier than most crossovers, and the braking is responsive. It also offers a Sport Mode. While I’m not usually a fan of continuously variable automatic transmissions, the Murano’s is flawless. The engine doesn’t whine, and it doesn’t seem like you’re driving a “Jetsons” car; it’s just smooth and quiet.\n\nThe Murano starts at $29,290 for the base S trim with front-wheel drive. My test car, a SV with all-wheel drive, cost $34,495.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Murano’s unique styling isn’t for everyone, but it helps it to stand out on the road. From the side, it looks all curvy and aggressive, and the rear is well-done with sharp, angled taillights.\n\nAs a parent, the Murano is easy to work with. If you have kids in infant-safety seats, the doors are tall enough that you won’t bonk your head when getting your child situated. If your kids are in convertible seats, the smaller ones will need a hand opening the door and getting in, but not as much as with a large SUV. If your kids are yet older but still in boosters, no worries; they’ll be able to open and close the doors on their own.\n\nThe tailgate was easy to use mostly because my test car came with a power liftgate, which I didn’t have in my 2006 Murano. If you think this feature is frivolous, let me challenge you with a grocery store parking lot in a snowstorm. Or a hail storm. Or a 2-year-old tantrum-storm. Trust me, this feature is worth it. Once the liftgate is open, there’s plenty of room for strollers (even double ones), bags, groceries and lots of other things.\n\nMy test car had a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. This engine does just fine in the power department, and with an EPA-estimated 18/23 mpg city/highway, you’ll be glad it’s not a whole lot bigger. Thankfully, the Murano uses regular gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Murano’s interior caters to families, with everything within reach and well-placed.\n\nIn the front row, the seats were comfortable and heated in my test car. The fabric upholstery looked somewhat velvety and posh, but if you’ve got babies and sippy cups or bottles, you may want to opt up for leather seating surfaces.\n\nThe 2011 Murano’s instrument panel has a sophisticated-looking set of gauges. The chrome accents give it a traditional feel. There was thought in the design of the stereo and climate controls; brushed-metal-looking buttons and knobs are incorporated in a long bar, and they were sleek yet easy to identify and use. The look complemented the rest of the interior.\n\nAt MotherProof.com, we often complain about technology that’s too complicated to use. In the Murano, the Bluetooth hands-free phone system was a cinch to use. It was easy to pair up my phone and use the system in a heartbeat. Yay for simple, easy technology!\n\nIn the backseat, I have to mention the flat floor. I could put my purse back there if I needed without it falling into one of the footwells. The lack of hump (stop your giggling right now) enabled Nissan to put a nifty cubby in the center console’s rear end, so the kids could put stuff in there. The kids were also happy with the legroom and the dual moonroof. Backseat passengers like a little light and it helped to lighten up the black velvety interior.\n\nAs for other happy things in the Murano, I must mention the 60/40-split flat-folding rear seats. They are so easy to use; from the cargo space, you just pull a handle on either side and the seats fold flat. Boom, that’s it. It’s not complicated, it’s not tricky and it doesn’t involve lots of hurdles and lurching and grunting. Thank you, Murano!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nMy kids’ booster seats fit like a charm in the backseat. The seat belt buckles were a little floppy, but older kids won’t struggle with them. Younger ones may need a little help buckling up on their own. The three tether anchors were easy to access, yet the two sets of lower Latch anchors were a little tight against the seat bottom. In MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check, the 2011 Murano fit three child-safety seats in its backseat.\n\nThe Murano has been crash-tested by both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In IIHS’ tests, it scored the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. It scored Marginal in a roof-strength test. It also received four stars out of five overall in NHTSA’s crash tests.\n\nThe Murano is equipped with safety features such as four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist, front-wheel drive, active head restraints, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional safety features include all-wheel drive and a backup camera.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Nissan Murano here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Nissan Murano remains a comfortable five-seat crossover body-type SUV with a higher-quality interior than you’d expect from a non-luxury brand, but shoppers should watch out for this Nissan’s gas mileage.\n\nNow three years into its second generation, the Nissan Murano is showing its age — not in the driving experience or its interior quality, but in efficiency. This stands out because the Murano was once one of the most efficient SUVs on the market, thanks to car-based construction and an efficient continuously variable automatic transmission, both of which were rare in the midsize class when the Murano made its 2003 debut.\n\nWhat’s New\nWith the addition of an Nissan Murano SV trim level for 2011, the Murano comes in four trims: S, SV, SL and LE. Starting with the 2012 model, the Nissan Murano S trim level has a 7-inch monochrome display and the LE is eligible for a new optional Platinum Package, which adds 20-inch alloy wheels and a navigation system. Otherwise, there are few changes for 2012 (see the two model years compared). All trims come with front- or all-wheel drive (AWD). We tested a Murano SL AWD.\n\nRewards Await You\nThe Murano is a peculiar-looking crossover; always has been. If you can get past that, or like it, rewards await you inside. Particularly in the higher trim levels, the Nissan Murano has a nicely appointed cabin. The SL we drove had rich leather and one of my favorite elements: real aluminum trim. Why many luxury automakers continue to use obviously fake stuff boggles the mind. Speaking of luxury, since the beginning the Murano has bumped up against the Infiniti brand, which Nissan owns, but there was never a direct conflict. (The midsize Infiniti FX has rear-wheel drive and a separate platform altogether.) The all-new 2013 Infiniti JX35 is much more like the Murano, though it’s larger and seats seven. Merely $1,615 separates the top front-drive Murano trim from the base JX35, however.\n\nThe Nissan Murano’s three-passenger backseat doesn’t have the fore/aft adjustment we’ve come to appreciate in more recent crossover models, but those in the rear seats won’t be hurting for legroom, despite a specification that’s lower than those of a few key competitors. The cargo area is large enough, too.\n\n \n\nMurano vs. Midsize Competitors: Key Differences\n \tNissan Murano\tFord Edge\tHyundai Santa Fe\tToyota Highlander\nFront legroom\t43.6\t40.7\t42.6\t43.2\nRear legroom\t36.3\t39.6\t36.8\t38.3\nCargo volume\n(cu. ft., all seats raised/all folded)\t31.6 / 64.0\t32.2 / 68.9\t34.2 / 78.2\t10.3* / 95.4\nBase towing capacity (pounds)\t3,500\t2,000\t2,000\t1,500\n*Behind third row; with third row folded, volume is 42.3 cu. ft.\nSource: Automakers\n\nAll told, the rear seats are exceptionally well executed. A canvas strap on the door side of the outboard seats allows passengers to adjust the 60/40-split backrest’s angle easily. The seats also fold flat in a single step. Because they’re spring-tensioned, you can lower them from the cargo area, too, using levers on the corresponding side. Even better, an optional power return feature on the higher two trim levels lets you raise them from the same location. If a passenger opens the backdoor to find the seat folded, the driver can raise it remotely using a switch on the dashboard.\n\nTo see how various child-safety seats fit in the Murano, click here.\n\nComfort & Poise\nAll the interior niceties would be meaningless if the Nissan Murano were otherwise disappointing, but that’s far from the case. It provides a good mix of ride comfort and handling poise, and the standard 3.5-liter V6 has plenty of power. The Murano was an early adopter of the continuously variable automatic transmission, and its pairing with Nissan’s V6 has arguably been the best CVT execution on the market. Even so, time has passed, and this time around we noticed some hesitation in accelerator response with the CVT, especially from a standing start. It was consistent and predictable, which makes it a bit less troubling, and there’s no shortage of conventional automatics that exhibit the same behavior, and often exhibit worse. Just be sure to pay attention to it if you go for a test drive.\n\nFalling Behind\nWhat hasn’t aged as well are the Murano’s gas mileage figures, which have long been among its high points in this vehicle class, especially when equipped with AWD. At an estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway for front-wheel and 18/23 mpg for four-wheel drive, the mileage hasn’t changed, but the landscape has. Comparable crossovers are now more efficient, including the Ford Edge, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander (see base versions compared). Likewise, models with three rows of seats, like the Honda Pilot, are more efficient, as is the Ford Explorer if you select the optional turbocharged engine. A literal heavyweight, the pricey Volkswagen Touareg falls behind the Murano at 16/23 mpg, but is also available in high-mileage diesel and hybrid versions.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the 2012 Nissan Murano rated four stars overall out of five. Its rollover rating — which predicts rollover likelihood — is a typical four stars. Unfortunately, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s roof-strength test — which predicts occupant protection in an actual rollover — the Murano scored Marginal, which is below average. This relatively new test cost the Murano the Top Safety Pick designation it had held previously thanks to Good scores in the other tests.\n\nAs is required of all vehicles starting with the 2012 model year, the Nissan Murano comes with anti-lock brakes and an electronic stability system. The front seats include side-impact airbags and active head restraints, and there are side curtain airbags to protect both the front and rear seats. See all the standard safety features here.\n\nPerhaps another sign of this Nissan’s age is the absence of active safety features — things like radar-based blind spot warning, pre-collision brake assist and a lane departure warning system.\n\nMurano in the Market\nA longtime Cars.com Best Bet, the Nissan Murano lost the designation in 2012 due to its below-average mileage and substandard roof strength, but it remains a favorite among Cars.com editors thanks to all its benefits. If you aren’t concerned about a mile per gallon here or there, the Murano still stands tall against newer competition.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2013 about the 2013 Nissan Murano. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe aging 2013 Nissan Murano is a high-quality, comfortable SUV that struggles to compete with the value and fuel economy of fresher competitors.\n\nNissan’s current version of the Murano is five years running without significant changes, and that’s too long considering just about every other five-seat midsize SUV on the market has received a significant redesign in that segment. SUVs like the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 2014 Kia Sorento now rival the Murano in areas where the Nissan previously triumphed, such as an interior that was nicer than anything else in the segment. Compare the Murano with its competitors here.\n\nStill, the Murano’s onetime greatness keeps it from being a complete dog even among brand-new SUVs. There’s still a lot to like in its sophisticated ride and leather-upholstered trim levels, which excel in offering a premium experience. Unfortunately, the cloth interior on base trims takes away much of the niceness, and it’s the only seating material offered until you get to the expensive SL trim level, which goes for $36,235, including destination charge. I tested a cloth-seated SV with all-wheel drive. Compare Murano trim levels here.\n\nThe Inside\nThe $37,770 as-tested price of our SV with cloth interior was out of line with what buyers can get for that money in competing models. There’s nothing wrong with the cloth seats, but a leather interior is expected at this kind of luxury-car price. The cloth proved extremely comfortable in both rows of seating, however. The deep cushions have superior levels of comfort, with support similar to what I would imagine a giant cloth baseball glove chair would offer.\n\nThe beige interior as a whole has a homey and welcoming vibe, though the Murano’s black interior is the classier choice and hides the aging design better. Competitors are catching up to the Murano’s near-Infiniti quality, which used to be unique in this segment. For similar or less money, the Grand Cherokee is classily appointed, with high-quality, soft-touch materials; the Sorento is available with Nappa leather seating; and the Santa Fe Sport offers luxurious saddle-colored leather that oozes personality and quality.\n\nThe Murano still has nice touches, like real aluminum interior trim. The interior style is more functional than eye-popping, with a traditional layout of controls. You’ll find high-quality knobs and easy-to-read buttons in the Murano rather than the hard-to-use capacitive touch buttons some automakers are adopting in order to give iPad-like usability … and save manufacturing money.\n\nCompetitors are catching up to the Murano in terms of roominess as well as interior quality. The Murano holds its own, with plenty of room for front and rear occupants. I could sprawl out in the backseat even with the front seat in my driving position. A nearly flat floor makes the interior feel extra roomy and gives ample legroom for a middle passenger. Those looking for maximum cargo room, though, may have to look elsewhere. The Murano’s 31.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat is less than the Grand Cherokee’s 35.1 cubic feet, the Santa Fe Sport’s 35.4 cubic feet and the Sorento’s 36.9 cubic feet. The seven-seat 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, which is priced similarly to the Murano and shares many of its driving and comfort characteristics, has more cargo room behind the sliding second-row seat (when the third row is folded), offering a maximum 47.8 cubic feet.\n\nQuick-release handles in the cargo area drop the Murano’s backseat flat with no effort. Frequent users will appreciate the quickness.\n\nFeatures & Technology\nOur near-$38,000 Murano included navigation, a V-6 engine, all-wheel drive, an optional Bose stereo and a power liftgate. It’s what isn’t present that seriously hurts the Murano’s value: no sunroof, no leather seats, no heated or cooled seats, no sliding second row and no blind-spot or lane-departure warning systems on trim levels below the $36,235 SL. Many of these features are available for the same price or less on competitors. The Murano’s features are well-executed. The 7-inch touch-screen, part of a $2,270 Value Package, is intuitive and has easy-to-read graphics, but it’s positioned too far forward to reach when driving. However, there is a center knob below the display that works well for controlling navigation and other menu functions when the touch-screen is out of reach. An impressive nine-speaker Bose stereo is part of that package, as is a power liftgate and streaming Bluetooth audio.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Murano is a guaranteed comfortable experience no matter where or how it’s driven. The Murano was far ahead of its time in offering a smooth, quiet, refined ride back when SUVs were more about utility and trucklike ride and handling, and its ride quality is just as impressive today. The Toyota Venza and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport are more athletic crossovers for those seeking a fun-to-drive option, while the Murano leans into corners like a big, comfy sedan. That’s not a huge knock, considering how refined and well-composed the Murano feels while cruising down the road.\n\nRefinement is the name of the game for the standard 3.5-liter V-6, which makes 260 horsepower. The continuously variable automatic transmission is perhaps the best version of this type, easily fooling drivers into thinking it’s a standard, fixed-gear transmission without the typically sloppy acceleration common to CVTs. Acceleration is effortless.\n\nWhat hurts the Murano is its EPA-estimated gas mileage at 18/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive and 18/24/20 mpg with front-wheel drive. Compared with the competition’s innovative technology, the Murano is lacking. Turbocharged four-cylinder engines, eight-speed automatic transmissions, Eco driving modes and diesel engines — none of which were commonplace when the Murano was last redesigned — often give the others an efficiency edge.\n\nA Hyundai Santa Fe Sport with its base engine and all-wheel drive is rated 20/26/22 mpg, and with front-wheel drive is 21/29/24 mpg. The Santa Fe Sport’s optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, closer to the Murano’s V-6 in power, still beats the Murano’s gas mileage: 19/24/21 mpg with all-wheel drive and 20/27/23 mpg with front-wheel drive. Unlike the Santa Fe, Sorento or Ford Edge, the Murano doesn’t have a more efficient engine choice. Even the larger Pathfinder is rated with better gas mileage than the Murano, at 19/25/21 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Murano got the top score of Good in front-, side- and rear-impact tests, but scored Marginal in a roof-strength test — below Good and Acceptable, but above Poor. Only one other model subjected to this test in the agency’s Midsize SUV class scored Marginal; two scored Acceptable and 17 earned Good scores.\n\nThe Murano received four out of five stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. Standard safety equipment includes front airbags, side-impact airbags for front occupants, side curtain airbags for front and rear seating, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes.

Despite its age, the Murano’s seating, ride comfort and roominess are exceptional. However, in addition to the competition that’s stepped up its game, the Nissan Pathfinder is similar to the Murano in price and offers more room and better gas mileage ratings. At its sticker price, there’s not enough value in the Murano’s feature content, cargo room or gas mileage, which are three biggies for crossover SUV shoppers.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: Once the top of its class, the Murano now lags behind despite a recent update.\n\nVersus the competition: Multimedia improvements bring the Murano up-to-date technologically, but the new Honda Passport and other competitors offer more compelling combinations of features, space and price.\n\nSUVs are everything these days. Don’t believe me? Here’s a list of automakers who don’t currently have one in their lineup: Aston Martin (working on one), Ferrari (allegedly working on one), Genesis (working on one), McLaren (not working on one … yet), Bugatti (nothing yet) and Smart (soon to stop selling cars in the U.S.). The importance of the SUV makes the 2019 Murano update all the more disappointing.\n\nThe Murano competes in a crowded field of five-seat mid-size SUVs, many of which have undergone significant updates or are entirely new for 2019 or 2020. The 2019 Honda Passport and Chevrolet Blazer have been resurrected and return as all-new designs, while the 2019 Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento are all significantly updated. Only the Jeep Grand Cherokee uses an older design, but it offers more significant model variations than others in the class — often for a significant premium. Compare the Murano against its chief competitors here and here.\n\nFor 2019, the Murano got a new grille, new LED head- and taillights, new paint and wheel options, a more luxurious top-of-the-line interior, and additional advanced safety features for higher trim levels — though still no ProPilot Assist, which combines adaptive cruise control (which the Murano offers) with automatic lane-centering steering (which it doesn’t).\n\nWhat We Tested\n\nOur test model was a Murano SL with front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is optional on all trims). The SL is the second-highest trim available, and the only option package is the SL Technology Package ($1,970), which adds:\n\nAutomatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nRear automatic braking\nHigh-beam assist\nLane departure warning\nLane keep assist\nTraffic sign recognition\nPanoramic moonroof\n\nThose features are part of Nissan’s Safety Shield 360, which also includes blind spot warning, forward collision warning and rear cross-traffic alert, though those come standard, not as part of the Technology Package. It’s a less advanced safety suite than ProPilot Assist, which isn’t available on the Murano but is offered on the Rogue and Leaf. It’s unfortunate that the moonroof is lumped in, not offered as a stand-alone option, but that’s how Nissan does it.\n\nThe only other options on the Murano we drove were a set of carpeted floormats for $245 and Sunset Drift Chromaflair paint for $395. Nearly every other paint color on the Murano is a no-cost option, but if you want a pumpkin-colored SUV, you’re welcome to pay for it.\n\nExterior\n\nLooks-wise, there’s little difference between this generation of the Murano and the previous one. Nissan’s signature V-Motion grille is deeper and more pronounced, and as mentioned above, the available LED head- and taillights are new. The Murano’s floating roof is still there. We aren’t big fans of the look, but it’s so much more common across the industry now that it doesn’t come across as garish. (Look at a Chevrolet Blazer and tell me it isn’t a Murano with a Camaro face).\n\nInterior\n\nThe Murano’s interior is pleasant enough, at least in the front seats. They’re well-padded, and materials quality is pretty strong for the class. Nissan used metal-looking accents up front to provide some visual contrast to the black interior, and they do a nice job of breaking up the lines. I was disappointed, though, by the cheap plastic surrounding the window switches and locks on the doors; it’s less noticeable on the driver’s side, where there are more controls, but on the front passenger and rear doors, it stands out.\n\nRear-seat comfort wasn’t too bad for my 6-foot-1 frame even with the driver’s seat in my preferred position. The bottom cushions are low to the floor, causing taller passengers to sit with their knees raised. It’ll make long drives a chore, but it’s not too bad for shorter jaunts. My hair brushed the roof when sitting perfectly upright in the backseat, but at least I didn’t need to slouch to keep my head from whacking the headliner.\n\nThe multimedia system in the Murano isn’t my favorite in the class or the market at large. The screen resolution is so-so, and the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto feels more like lipstick on a pig than a wild technological advance. It’s fairly intuitive and certainly improved over past Nissan systems, but other automakers — like Hyundai, Kia and the Fiat Chrysler brands — have it beat in terms of graphics quality and ease of use. At least Nissan still includes volume and tuning knobs, while the Honda Passport lacks the latter. The inclusion of a USB-C port next to each USB-A (the more common kind) front and rear is nifty, but not enough to make the cabin suddenly feel futuristic. (The front pair support data while the rear pair are for device charging only.)\n\nRear visibility is hampered by the rear head restraints and small rear-quarter window, but it’s forward visibility that’s really poor. The Murano’s raked styling leads not only to a smaller windshield, but also wide A-pillars that extend forward and obstruct the driver’s view. Those pillars are also convenient for pedestrians to hide behind, turning intersections (and downtown parking garage exits) into adventures.\n\nDriving Fun? Not Here\n\nAlso making parking garages something of an adventure is the Murano’s steering. We found it oddly underboosted and heavy in the 2016 Murano, and three model years later, that hasn’t changed. It takes a lot more effort than it should to maneuver the Murano at low speeds, almost as if the SUV lacked power steering entirely. There’s no reward to this heavy feeling like there is in a sports car, though, as the Murano’s steering remains numb and vague even at higher speeds.\n\nThe SL comes standard with 20-inch wheels, but there’s little penalty when it comes to ride quality, which is good. Harshness is minimal over rough roads and expansion joints, even compared with more off-road-leaning competitors, such as the Passport.\n\nWith a tried-and-true 3.5-liter V-6 instead of an increasingly common four-cylinder engine, you might expect the Murano to have one of the sportier driving experiences in the class. That’s … not really the case. Power is adequate for both city and highway driving, and the V-6 at least makes passing maneuvers and highway merges easy enough to not induce panic or require significant advanced planning. But the Murano is held back by its continuously variable automatic transmission, which simply isn’t responsive enough to push the SUV toward a rewarding driving experience. The Murano also lacks selectable driving modes that could tune transmission response for either sportier driving or greater fuel efficiency.\n\nThis one-size-fits-all approach leaves the Murano feeling average, though its EPA fuel-economy estimates place it near the top of the mid-size SUV class. Both front- and all-wheel-drive models are rated 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined. The new Chevrolet Blazer, when equipped with a V-6 and front-wheel drive, lags behind the Murano, at 20/26/22 mpg, as does the Passport, at 20/25/22 mpg. With front-wheel drive, the Ford Edge is rated 22/29/25 mpg — more efficient, but that’s with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nSo It Carries a Lot of Stuff?\n\nNot really. Nissan lists cargo volume in a moonroof-equipped Murano at 31.1 cubic feet behind the backseat and 65 cubic feet with the seat folded. It gains 1 and 2 cubic feet, respectively, without the moonroof (but remember, that also costs you safety features thanks to Nissan’s options structure).\n\nManufacturer numbers aren’t especially reliable, but what really makes the Murano seem less useful is that — by Nissan’s own measurements — a two-row compact Rogue SUV has more cargo volume than the Murano, at 39.3 and 70 cubic feet, respectively. The Murano’s cargo area is, like the rest of the vehicle, just adequate. It’s dwarfed by the Passport’s cavernous cargo area, and the Edge also beats it. The Blazer’s cargo numbers are just slightly lower than the Nissan’s.\n\nHow About Safety?\n\nThe Murano we tested had a host of safety features packaged as Safety Shield 360, including automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, high-beam assist, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and traffic sign recognition, all of which are optional. Blind spot warning, forward collision warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard.\n\nSafety Shield 360 is a less advanced safety suite than Nissan’s ProPilot Assist, which includes lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control that doesn’t deactivate after a few seconds at a full stop. ProPilot Assist is not currently available on the Murano, though it can be added to the Rogue. Adaptive cruise control is optional on the Murano SV and standard on higher trims, but it’s not offered on the base Murano S. It works all the way to a stop but allows the Murano to creep forward again after a second or two.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not rated the 2019 Murano as of publication; when it does, results will replace the 2018 information here. IIHS dinged the 2018 Murano for its headlights and did not perform a passenger-side small overlap front crash test. Its 2018 headlight rating of marginal is one step above the lowest rating, poor, but the 2018 Murano’s overall performance with the Institute is in good company. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Murano a five-star overall rating. The Murano also aced our Car Seat Check; we were even able to fit three child-safety seats across the backseat.\n\nWhy Buy a Murano?\n\nA model that once won our comparison test for its class has fallen behind many of its competitors — and even other offerings from Nissan. On top of that, the Murano is one of the more expensive vehicles in its class: Ours topped out at $42,885 including a $1,045 destination fee — not exactly a bargain for what feels like a middling SUV. While the Murano offers a plusher interior than its Rogue sibling, why not save a few thousand dollars and get more safety features, more cargo room and improved fuel economy? That is, if you insist on buying a Nissan.\n\nAmong class competitors, there are better deals to be had from both Hyundai and Kia, and while similarly priced, the new Honda Passport offers more standard safety features. If it’s a Murano you really want, it may be worthwhile to wait for a full redesign, which should happen within the next couple model years.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
