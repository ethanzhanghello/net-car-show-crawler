      "expert_review": "Car names are fun to play with. Take the 2009 Nissan Rogue, for example. The Rogue doesn’t play by the rules; It colors outside the lines and lives outside the box. I could go on and on. In this case, though, the name doesn’t quite fit because the Nissan Rogue doesn’t really do any of those things. It’s cute, perky and practical. The Nissan Rogue is no rogue. Sorry, naming department.\n\nThe Rogue is a super-cute compact SUV/crossover. It’s longer than its competitors; it’s narrower, too, which means less hip room in the backseat. However, there’s plenty of legroom and cargo space. It’s actually the perfect size for a family of four. There was enough room for my family and a friend, and it was small enough to fit into parking spots and our garage.\n\nThe Rogue is fun to drive, with a spunky four-cylinder engine that handles hills and highway merges with no problem. That engine isn’t the quietest thing on the road, but road noise is only moderate and not obnoxious. While the view to the front and sides was fine, I found rear visibility to be somewhat limited. Sadly, there is no optional backup camera to help matters.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Nissan Rogue doesn’t step all that far out of the box with its exterior. The Rogue looks just like the Murano’s little sister and has the same sloped profile.\n\nThe only sparkle on the Rogue’s profile is from the roof rack (of all things); the side mirrors and door handles are body-colored. The Rogue sits on 17-inch alloy wheels that somehow manage to look small. The wheel wells are taller than they are wide, and I think that tricks the eye. The overall impression from the side is one of sporty sleekness with a side of spunk thrown in.\n\nThe front view is dominated by the large headlights, which seem to wrap around the car. A small grille focuses the eye on the Nissan logo, which is chrome and surrounded by a chrome frame (just in case you missed it). There’s some subtle sculpting on the hood that suggests a large engine, but it’s nothing too glaring. Of course, the engine isn’t large, but it’s a nice suggestion anyhow.\n\nFrom the rear, the Rogue looks less sporty and more bulbous. It’s somewhat reminiscent of the Rogue’s other sibling, the Versa. A large body panel forms most of the rear, while a slim window offers some visibility.\n\nOpening and closing the doors is no problem, even for little ones, in the Rogue. The doors open wide enough to allow grown-ups to help kids in the backseat without having to become a contortionist to get back there. The Rogue sits a bit higher on the road than a sedan, but that only means less bending over when buckling in your babies.\n\nLittle legs don’t struggle much when climbing in, and there’s a flat stepping area to make it even easier for them. There’s plenty of headroom, even in the back, for little ones to walk around in this compact SUV, which makes life easier in the carpool lane. The rear cargo door opens easily, even without a power option. While it’s high enough to walk under, my 9-year-old was able to reach it to shut the liftgate. Yay!\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nNissan sticks with their usual minimalist approach to interiors and keeps things clean and sporty in the Rogue. Nearly everything in the cabin is trimmed in matte black with metallic trim.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel houses controls for the audio system, cruise control and the wireless phone connection. The Bluetooth system worked pretty well with only a few bugs answering incoming calls. The audio system sounds great, and after a quick perusal of the owner’s manual, I was working the satellite radio and presetting channels like a pro. The only messy part was the cord for my iPod, which plugs into the center stack, gets in the way of the cupholders. I was impressed with the cupholder setup, though. There is room for cups of different sizes, as well as mugs with handles. My morning cup of joe fit beautifully.\n\nThe center console has a couple of small cubbies for electronics or loose items. There is a dual level bin under the front armrest that’s perfect for extra charger cords or a pack of wipes or whatever you like to stash in there.\n\nOn the downside, the “navigation package” is really an ugly lump on the dashboard. It’s a covered port for a Garmin Nuvi 750 portable GPS; it isn’t an integrated navigation system at all. Nissan saves on the big screen, but you get to buy an expensive accessory and don’t get a backup camera. Bummer.\n\nThere’s room for everyone in this crossover, and the backseat is no exception. Three kids fit easily in the backseat, but only two booster seats or infant-safety seats will work back there. The center seat works great for a small-sized derriere but not for a big bulky car seat. There’s no center armrest in the second row, but there are two cupholders located on the back of the front row’s center console. While bigger kids can reach them, they’re out of reach for anyone in a car seat. There are no bottleholders in the doors either, so that’s it for beverage containment. It wasn’t much of an issue for my younger son since his booster seat has its own cupholder.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Nissan Rogue gets top safety marks. It was named a 2009 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this award, a car must earn the top rating of Good in frontal, side-impact and rear crash tests. The car also must have stability control. For 2010, the IIHS added a new roof-strength crash test to its Top Safety Pick criteria. The Rogue hasn’t undergone this test yet.\n\nBesides stability control, the Rogue also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist and traction control. It also comes with six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nThe Latch connectors are buried in the backseat, but a rear-facing car seat will fit in the second row without any problems. The floppy seat belt receptacles were an issue for both of my boys. My first-grader struggled to find it buried beneath his booster seat, and buckling up was definitely a two-handed job for my third-grader.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of room for rear-facing car seats.\n\nIn School: Floppy seat belt receptors make for frustrated kids.\n\nTeens: It’s a Top Safety Pick for 2009, which makes it a top pick for teen drivers.",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Nissan Rogue is the little brother of the Nissan Murano crossover, a vehicle that I used to own. The Rogue’s distinguishable look has been around since 2008, and it still looks interesting. However, I happened to be a little lukewarm on the looks, which is odd since it looks similar to the Murano, but these looks don’t translate well to the smaller version.\n\nMy test car, a Rogue SL with all-wheel drive, had a foufr-cylinder engine that gets you where you need to go. What stood out about the Rogue is its continuously variable automatic transmission. There’s no subtle jerk with the change of gears; it’s a seamless transition from one gear to the next. But the Rogue’s CVT didn’t sit well with me because it was loud. It felt like I was riding the clutch –  there is none – rather than admiring the finesse of a smooth transmission. At certain speeds the transmission couldn’t decide where it was most comfortable, and so it follows that I couldn’t either. I spent a lot of time in manual-shift mode to circumvent this problem. I wish the CVT’s performance wasn’t so weird.\n\nThe base Rogue starts at $20,460 and the Rogue SL with all-wheel drive trim starts at $23,300. My test car was priced at $27,295.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nWhile I’m not wild about the Rogue’s looks, it is a unique-looking vehicle, and I respect that. The grille has a perforated, hole-punched look. It leans much more toward a sporty look than the utilitarian looks of its competition such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.\n\nWhatever I think of the looks, the Rogue does a nice job with the kids. The doors aren’t too heavy or wide, so my kids could open them with ease and get in without incident. Parking-lot door dings and struggles to close the doors once the kids are in the car are a rarity in this five-seater. However, the step-in height will be a little high for preschoolers. The doors are a perfect height to get those infant carriers in place or buckle up your child without chronic head-bonking.\n\nThe Rogue’s cargo door is easy to reach and operate. This may sound strange, but the liftgate stays low enough when open for shorter people to reach it easily. It’s not too heavy, either, so I didn’t have to figure out how to leverage my body weight to close it in one pull. For this, I thank you, Nissan.\n\nThe Rogue has a 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and uses regular gas. A front-wheel-drive Rogue gets an EPA-estimated 22/27 mpg city/highway. The all-wheel-drive Rogue gets 21/26 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nStorage is at a premium in the Rogue. Truthfully, it’s a problem in many small cars and SUVs. The Rogue has two cupholders in the front row. There’s a slot next to the cupholders to house your cell phone or MP3 player of choice, but it’s not very deep so the gadget falls out at every turn. The doors have pockets in them, but they’re not wide enough to fit a water bottle, so I maxed out those cupholders pretty quickly. \n\nThe good news is the glove box is huge, so you can put stuff in there, namely, the owner’s manual (this doesn’t happen as often as it should). There’s also a center console. In the rear seats, the kids had two cupholders, which were at the base of the center console’s rear, and seatback pockets.\n\nOn the plus side, there’s pretty decent space in the cargo area for handling grocery runs and membership warehouse errands with ease. And that posterboard for the science project? It fits without having to bend it. There’s also a nifty tray under the cargo area floor that can manage small items like wet shoes or clothes for the trip home.\n\nWhat I also loved is the ease of use for the stereo and the climate controls. While this is certainly an argument from an old dog that doesn’t learn new tricks very well, it doesn’t mean that we can’t appreciate clearly labeled buttons and knobs on the minimalistic dash.\n\nThe seats were comfortable, and its cloth upholstery was unoffensive in its pattern and texture. Leather seats are available. All the buttons and knobs were comfortably within reach from my driving position, which is something I look for in a vehicle this size.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe Rogue received the top score of Good in front, side and rear crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In past years, these scores – when coupled with the Rogue’s standard stability control –  would have earned it Top Safety Pick status from IIHS. This year, IIHS added a roof-strength test to its Top Safety Pick criteria. In this test, the Rogue scored the second-place Acceptable. A rating of Good is needed for Top Safety Pick status.\n\nThe happy news for parents is that the Rogue easily fits child-safety seats. Well, it does as long as there are only two of them. Three just don’t fit. The second row’s bench seat is flat, and the seatbacks recline so you can find a good fit with a car seat. The lower Latch anchors were easy to work with. I was surprised that I could fit a rear-facing infant-safety seat behind the driver’s seat, but do note that the driver’s seat was set for my 5-foot-5-inch frame. With the infant seat behind me, I couldn’t scoot my seat back any farther, so plan accordingly.\n\nThe Rogue has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags in the front row and side curtains in both rows. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Nissan Rogue here.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Nissan Rogue is easily competitive on equipment and efficiency with other small crossovers, and it excels in refinement, styling and interior space.\n\nNissan’s compact crossover receives a major redo for the 2014 model year, switching to a new global platform to go after family buyers on several continents. It has a new, more aggressive look inside and out, one that is designed to project a more masculine appearance in hopes of attracting more men to the Rogue. The previous model appeals far more to women, according to Nissan’s research.\n\nWith competition in the compact crossover arena some of the hottest in the market and nearly every other competitor offering a new entry in the last two years, Nissan hopes its new model can continue the success of the old Nissan Rogue. See how the 2013 and 2014 Rogue models compare here.\nStyling\nWith the new platform comes new styling, and Nissan has definitely succeeded in crafting a compact SUV that many will find appealing. The Nissan family look is in full force, with more than a passing resemblance to the bigger Pathfinder that’s evident from every angle. The look is more truckish and aggressive than its competitors, with bulging wheel arches and a bigger nose than the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. Seventeen-inch steel wheels are standard on the base S trim, with 17-inch alloy wheels standard on the midlevel SV trim and 18-inch alloy wheels standard on the topline SL trim. New LED running lights up front and angular taillights will make the Rogue distinctive even in the dark.\nHow it Drives\nNissan kept the Nissan Rogue’s powertrain the same: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 170 horsepower and mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive an option. This combination is fine for everyday driving in relaxed conditions, making for an uneventful commute in around-town traffic thanks to decent tuning. But ask it for any kind of acceleration beyond moderate and you’ll come up wanting more.\n\nThe CVT winds the big four-cylinder motor up to its powerband and holds it there as you hold your foot to the floor, making more noise than motion. A standard Sport mode changes the transmission’s sensitivity and its responsiveness, but it doesn’t do much for acceleration-time improvement. It’s most noticeable when entering a highway or attempting a passing maneuver; you’ll want to plan well ahead for either of those actions.\n\nThe acceleration woes are really the only blemish on what has been transformed into a wonderfully driving small crossover. Ride quality is impressively controlled, with no chop or floatiness, and even moderately sized potholes and pavement blemishes do little to upset the Rogue’s suspension. It rides like a much bigger, more expensive vehicle, with obstacles like manhole covers eliciting little more than a muted whump in the cabin.\n\nHandling is sharper than expected. The thick steering wheel is not overly boosted and delivers excellent feedback to the driver. Brakes are very strong and firm, with excellent pedal feel and no noticeable fade. Zipping down the Natchez Trace Parkway in Tennessee during my test was an entertaining experience, with little body roll, road or wind noise, and an overall feel of refinement and sophistication that is lacking in the previous generation and some of the Nissan Rogue’s competitors. It’s not as sporty and aggressive as a Mazda CX-5, but the Rogue has been tuned more toward the comfort end of the dial.\n\nFuel economy in the new 2014 Nissan Rogue is also good. The standard front-wheel-drive Nissan Rogue gets an EPA-rated 26/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined; this drops slightly for the AWD model to 25/32/28 mpg. This puts Rogue at a combined 2 to 3 mpg advantage over a comparably equipped Ford Escape, RAV4 or CR-V, with only the smaller-engine CX-5 and CVT-equipped Subaru Forester nearly even with the Rogue. \n\nInterior\nNissan paid a lot of attention to the interior for the 2014 Nissan Rogue, creating a cabin that is inviting, attractive and comfortable for a variety of body types. Slide into the driver’s seat and the combination of command seating and low dashboard creates excellent visibility to the front and sides. Rearward visibility is still a bit challenged, becoming even more difficult when the optional third-row seats are raised.\n\nControls are mostly well-placed; the only issue comes from switch placement for the blind spot warning system and the transmission’s Sport mode — they’re low and to the left on the dash where they cannot be easily seen or touched.\n\nSeating is flexible, spacious and remarkably comfortable. Nissan continues to make hay over its so-called Zero Gravity seats that were supposedly designed with input from NASA, but regardless of their origin in Andromeda or Nissan’s Atsugi, Japan, design center, they actually deliver the promised comfort.\n\nThe second row of seats is also quite spacious at 37.9 inches, with much more legroom than expected for a compact SUV, stadium-style layout and long, tall windows for rear seat passengers that help prevent claustrophobia. The 2014 Rogue’s second-row legroom grew 2.6 inches over the 2013 model. Add in the huge panoramic sunroof overhead and the Nissan Rogue’s cabin feels tall, airy and pleasantly open. Climbing in and out of the backseat is also easier with doors that now open 77 degrees, allowing for easier placement of things like child-safety seats.\n\nNew for the Nissan Rogue this year is an optional third row of seats that’s available only on the base S and midlevel SV trim levels — if you really want a three-row crossover that tops $30,000, Nissan would instead like to show you the Pathfinder. The Nissan Rogue’s 50/50-split bench folds into the cargo area’s floor and doesn’t impact carrying capacity versus the standard Rogue when in the folded position. Given that this is a compact SUV, this is not a bench meant for adult-sized humans. If you’re planning on putting adults in the third row, try a Pathfinder. Even Nissan admits that the third row is best limited to children and over shorter distances. But with a standard second-row sliding feature that helps to equalize some legroom for all the passengers in the vehicle, it is indeed usable in a pinch.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\nNot only are the interior materials better, but the interior design is improved as well. Gauges are easily visible through the steering wheel and include a 5-inch color LCD, the largest in any Nissan product, to display a variety of customizable vehicle information.\n\nThe latest all-new Nissan should have the latest all-new electronics, and the Rogue doesn’t disappoint. A full complement of information and entertainment electronics are available, including navigation, satellite radio and Bluetooth streaming audio and phone connectivity. The Nissan Rogue features not only a backup camera but Nissan’s novel Around View Monitor, which uses cameras to display a 360-degree live feed of the Rogue’s environment on the touch-screen. Nissan is introducing NissanConnect, its branded multimedia service, which integrates a number of apps from Google searches to Pandora streaming radio. NissanConnect will be updated over the vehicle’s life with new programs and features. The system doesn’t seem quite as advanced as Chevrolet’s MyLink or Ford’s MyFord Touch system, but it is easy to use and seems to work reliably well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nPop the rear hatch (a power liftgate is optional) to reveal a spacious cargo area with low bumper liftover. The second-row seats fold flat in a 40/20/40 split, and the levers are accessible with a stretch from the cargo area to unlatch the seatbacks. Fold the front passenger seat flat as well to get a cargo area reportedly able to accommodate an 8-foot ladder. For models without the third-row seat, under-floor storage is presented with two reconfigurable dividers that can also act as package shelves.\n\nNot only does the Nissan Rogue cargo volume look bigger, it actually is bigger with 39.3 cubic feet of space available behind the second row of seats versus 34.3 for the Ford Escape, 38.4 for the Toyota RAV4 and 37.2 for the Honda CR-V. Fold the rear seats down and the Rogue’s 70 cubic feet still has an advantage over the Escape (73.4), but not the CR-V (70.9) or the RAV4 (73.4). Interior overall passenger volume is also biggest — 106 cubic feet not including the third-row seats versus 98 cubic feet for the Escape and 101 for both the RAV4 and CR-V.\n\nSafety\nNissan has offered up a number of electronic systems to help with safety, including optional blind spot warning, forward collision warning, lane departure warning systems and a movement sensor that alerts a driver when the Around View Monitor detects something entering the vehicle’s vicinity. The 2014 Rogue is too new to be crash-tested, but results will appear here when this happens. Check out a list of the new Rogue’s safety features here.\nValue in its Class\nThe new 2014 Nissan Rogue will be one of the least expensive compact SUVs on the market when it arrives in early 2014, base price starting at just $23,350, including an $860 destination fee, for an S trim model with front-wheel drive. Mitsubishi’s considerably smaller Outlander Sport is priced below that with an automatic transmission while Mazda’s CX-5 can be had with a manual transmission for less as well.\n\nNissan’s price includes standard features such as Bluetooth phone connectivity, steering-wheel audio controls, sliding and split-reclining second-row seats, backup camera and the cargo divider system. Stepping up to the midlevel SV trim adds $1,740 and a lot more content, including 17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, power seats, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and NissanConnect Apps, automatic climate control, push-button start and more. The third-row seat is optional on both the S and SV trims, but not available on the top SL trim, which rings in at $3,840 above the SV trim. The SL brings leather seats, navigation system, Bose audio, a power liftgate, heated seats and side mirrors, and 18-inch alloy wheels. Several option packages are available, including a panoramic moonroof, the third-row seating package and premium equipment packages. Adding AWD to any model bumps up the price by $1,350 regardless of trim level.\n\nThe competition in this segment is some of the hottest in the market, with almost all entries recently refreshed and selling well. The three most direct competitors will be the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, all of which are comparably priced, feature similar equipment and interior versatility. Like the RAV4 and CR-V, the Rogue offers only one powertrain; the Escape has a choice of three. The Nissan Rogue’s third row of seating does give it an advantage over competitors, but its utility is limited. The Rogue offers a more refined ride than the CR-V or RAV4, but it isn’t as sporting as the Ford Escape or the Mazda CX-5. What it does offer, however, is a more spacious backseat, one that is genuinely comfortable for real adults.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2019 Nissan Rogue is paddling as fast as it can to keep up in the red-hot compact SUV race. Feature updates and new driver-assistance tech have helped it keep pace, and it remains a leader in roominess and comfort. But time is catching up with the Rogue, which was last redesigned for the 2014 model year, and fresher rivals are showing up with much better driving manners and higher-quality interiors.\n\nThose demerits led the Rogue to finish seventh out of seven top-trim-level SUVs in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge. That said, it wasn’t far off the pace in the closely matched competition, and while it didn’t lead in any categories, it was runner-up in several, including driver-assistance and safety technology, as well as front-seat comfort. And while it was dinged for its dated interior and lackluster driving experience, a lot of compact SUV shoppers might care more about the space and comfort it offers. The 2019 Rogue is offered in base S, SV and SL trim levels, and a hybrid version is also available in SL and SV trims.\n\nLooks the Part of a Nissan SUV\n\nThe Rogue has a more traditional SUV appearance than a lot of new crossovers, and the design still has curb appeal. The tall, squarish shape is also functional, contributing to the Rogue’s ample people and cargo room. An aggressively sculpted face gets a full dose of Nissan design DNA, with a large and deep version of the family V-Motion grille and LED daytime running lights (LED headlights are available). The profile is marked by a low, dipping beltline and big wheel arches, bearing a strong resemblance to other Nissan SUVs. Large, angular taillights sit high on the corners of a busy rear end. The base S gets 17-inch steel wheels (alloys are optional), the SV gets 17-inch alloys (18s available) and the SL has 19-inch rims — the best fit for the Rogue’s big arches.\n\nRoomy and a Little Dated Inside\n\nYour first impression inside is how spacious it feels for a compact SUV. The front seats are broad and well-cushioned. They lack much lateral support, but you won’t be carving canyons in the Rogue anyway. Headroom is excellent even with the panoramic moonroof. Things aren’t economy class in the rear seat, either: It reclines and slides, so you can prioritize seating or cargo — or move a child within reach. And at 6-foot-2, I found my head didn’t brush the ceiling, nor did my knees hit the front seat behind a tall driver. Large, wide-opening doors also ease access (and getting your child into a car seat). The low beltline and big windows add an airy feel, even in versions without the big moonroof.\n\nCompact SUV competition is intense, however, and the Rogue’s interior design and materials, while pleasant enough, look dated next to rivals such as the new Toyota RAV4 and recently freshened Honda CR-V. There’s an uneven mix of materials, with the top-of-the-line SL combining an upscale stitched dashboard wrap, leather seating and piano-black trim with areas of hard plastic. Materials also drop some in the back seat, where there are more hard surfaces on the doors. Fit and finish quality, particularly with the upholstery, is just average. And the leather seating that’s standard on the SL has what Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder described as a “low-rent sheen.”\n\nMy SL test car had a heated steering wheel and heated front seats, though many competitors offer rear-seat heaters, as well. The layout of the dashboard and operation of the controls was mostly logical and easy with the exception of an odd location for the blind spot warning switch and drive mode controls; they’re down by the driver’s left knee, making them hard not just to use but even to see. The cabin is average for wind and road noise, but it loses the struggle to filter out the noisy powertrain.\n\nMultimedia and Tech\n\nThe standard 7-inch center touchscreen seems old-school these days, and so does its cluttered user interface design. It’s also positioned too far below the driver’s line of sight, but the system is easy to use and has welcome shortcut buttons, plus volume and tuning knobs. While Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, even the top SL trim has just two USB ports, one at the front of the center console and one in the console bin. If you haven’t bought a car in a while, that might seem fine, but others are more USB-generous, including charging ports for the backseat.\n\nThe Rogue had one of the first 360-degree camera systems in a compact SUV, and it’s standard on the 2019 SL, but rivals also have them now — most with sharper resolution.\n\nDrives Noisy and Slow\n\nThe Rogue’s driving manners might be OK for some buyers of compact SUVs, which no one expects to be a sports car, but even by that standard, it’s not fun to drive. Guilty parties include the Rogue’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 170 horsepower; that’s less motivation than most rivals, and it gave the Rogue the lowest power-to-weight ratio among the SUVs in our Challenge. It’s mated to a raucous continuously variable automatic transmission that has rubber-band lag at start-up and in passing, and it howls like it’s being injured when you mash your foot for more power — which is often with this engine. As Cars.com Senior Research Editor Mike Hanley put it, “Droning engine noise is your constant companion when driving the Rogue.”\n\nIf there were a stronger powertrain, you still wouldn’t be tempted to push the Rogue. Even moderately hard cornering or evasive maneuvers bring out lots of body lean and tire scrub. In return, however, you get a soft, compliant ride. Despite the body motion, it might be a worthy tradeoff if your commute is on rough city streets. The steering is very light, and the brakes feel soft and are slow to react to more pedal pressure, while the chassis allows considerable nose dive on hard braking.\n\nThe Rogue is among the leaders in the compact SUV category when it comes to EPA gas mileage ratings: 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD (27 mpg combined with AWD). That’s close to the 30 mpg combined estimate for front-drive 2019 versions of both the RAV4 and the CR-V (with its more efficient engine). Compare them here. In real-world testing during our Challenge, however, Rogue gas mileage was well behind those two; it tied for last in the Challenge.\n\nFor better mileage, the Rogue offers a gas-electric hybrid version of the top two trim levels, which I did not test. The hybrid system uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor, making for a net output of 174 hp with front- or all-wheel drive. It’s EPA-rated at 33/35/34 mpg city/highway/combined (33 mpg combined with AWD). That compares well to the 2018 RAV4 Hybrid AWD, but it’s no match for the redesigned 2019 RAV4 Hybrid, which gets an estimated 40 mpg combined with its 219-hp hybrid system and standard AWD. Compare them here.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nAs with its roomy seating, the Rogue shines when it comes to cargo room. It offers 39.3 cubic feet behind the rear seat 70 cubic feet with the backseat folded. That’s in a league with the capacious CR-V (39.2 and 75.8) and the RAV4 (37.6 and 69.8). And the Rogue has more flexibility, with a 40/20/40, split-folding backrest (though the center section doesn’t fold flat with the floor) and a front passenger seat that folds rearward to help fit longer items. The rear cargo area has storage space under the floor and features a cargo system that can be configured for multiple floor heights, an upper cargo shelf or divided space. You might find the configurations helpful, but I’m not sure how much I would use them. Also, the plastic supports for the system on the sides of the cargo area will get in your way when you want maximum open space. A hands-free power liftgate is standard on the SV and SL.\n\nI wanted more and better cabin storage space for smaller items so I could save the cupholders for cups. There are small door pockets (very small in the rear doors) and a smallish center console bin. There’s also a shallow space at the front of the center console where you might put a phone, but it’s neither the shape nor the size of a phone.\n\nUp-to-Date Safety and Driver Aids\n\nThe Rogue earned top scores in five Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests; it has not yet undergone the difficult passenger-side small overlap front crash test. The standard front crash prevention system with automatic emergency braking earned the agency’s top score, and the LED headlights that are optional on the SL rated acceptable. The standard headlights for all trim levels, however, were rated poor.\n\nThe 2019 Rogue meets or beats even its newest rivals in the latest safety and driver-assistance tech. Standard on all Rogues is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, as is lane departure warning, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. New for 2019 is rear automatic braking and rear parking sensors for SV and SL trim levels.\n\nAlso standard on the SL (and optional on the SV) is Nissan’s excellent ProPilot Assist driver aid system that combines adaptive cruise control with stop and go and an advanced lane-centering system. It handles acceleration, braking and steering in highway driving with marked lanes. There are similar capabilities in some other compact SUVs, but Nissan’s system is one of the simplest to use — and the most reliable. Just press the blue ProPilot button on the steering wheel and set the cruise control speed and you’re good to go. A dashboard graphic and alert clearly let you know when it’s engaged or disengaged.\n\nForgetful people and busy parents will appreciate the 2019 Rogue’s new standard rear door alert, which reminds you to check the backseat once you’ve parked if either rear door was used when you departed (if you haven’t already reopened it after stopping). It starts out with a dashboard message, like similar systems, but escalates to horn chirps if you don’t respond. The Rogue also rates well for accommodating child-safety seats. See Cars.com’s 2019 Rogue Car Seat Check.\n\nPricing and Value\n\nThe 2019 Rogue starts at $25,965 for the base S with front-wheel drive (all prices include destination fees). It has more standard features — including advanced safety tech — than a 2019 CR-V LX ($25,395 with FWD) and matches up well on features with a 2019 RAV4 LE ($26,595). Pricing ranges up to the AWD SL trim ($33,785) versus a CR-V Touring AWD ($35,195) or a RAV4 Limited AWD ($35,995). You can compare the Rogue’s features by trim level with these rivals here. Hybrid Rogues range from the SV with FWD (starting at $28,645) to the SL with AWD ($33,935).\n\nThe practical and roomy 2019 Rogue isn’t a bad choice if its best points match what you most value — and if you get a good price. The competition is close, but several newer rivals are better than merely OK. They should get a look before you buy.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Rogue lived up to its name when it debuted in 2008. Not much has changed with the two-row crossover since then except that its competition has received significant recent updates, surpassing the Rogue’s modern looks and challenging its utility.\n\nThe Nissan Rogue could bridge this gap with its competition with a dedicated update that’s more committed than the 2013 iteration I tested.\n\nThis five-seater has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The driving experience was fine. If you commute and are just interested in a Point-A-to-Point-B machine, the Rogue does well. If you’re looking for any more character, you’ll likely be left a little disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, the Rogue stands out for its in-cabin noise. The engine’s noise paired with the CVT is almost unbearable. I wanted to wear noise-canceling headphones while driving the Rogue, and I almost let the noise detract from everything else about the vehicle.\n\nThe 2013 Nissan Rogue has a starting price of $23,455, including an $845 destination charge. My test car, a top-of-the-line Rogue SV with the SL Package and all-wheel drive, cost $30,965.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen the Rogue first debuted in 2008, it looked much like its larger sibling, the Murano, though the five-seater was smaller and a touch sleeker. What a difference a few years makes. Though it was refreshed in 2011, the Rogue now looks dated because some of its competitors — the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V — have received redesigns recently. It’s enough to make me look at the Rogue longingly and wonder what’s next.\n\nThe 2013 Rogue is a mostly family-friendly crossover in terms of accessibility. The door handles are a little high for tykes, but the doors are lightweight and easy to manage. The step-in height also is manageable.\n\nIn the cargo area, groceries should fit easily, but don’t expect to add a double-stroller into the mix. The backseat is split 60/40, so it’s easy to expand the cargo area. The front passenger seat folds flat in case you need to haul lumber or other longer items.\n\nThe 2013 Rogue has 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and a CVT. It gets an EPA-estimated 23/28 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 22/27 mpg with all-wheel drive. It uses regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Rogue’s interior is interesting and highlights a compact crossover conundrum. I expect a ton of utility from a crossover; even though it’s small, I’m thinking “Oooh, crossover … more storage, more capacity!” But that isn’t always so. The Rogue lacks storage: It has two front-row cupholders and a narrow cubby behind the gearshift, but there are no other open areas for storage. There’s a center console that’s deep enough to hold a box of tissues. Add a couple narrow door pockets and that’s it.\n\nThe Rogue is comfortable, though, and there are some goodies. The black leather seats of my test vehicle were perforated to reveal red material underneath. The navigation system is easy to use, and the simplicity of the climate controls is great. My test car had Nissan’s Around View Monitor system, which uses four cameras for a bird’s-eye view around the car; it’s especially helpful when parking.\n\nHeated leather seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and heated side mirrors are part of the optional SL Package ($3,900). It also includes a seven-speaker Bose stereo system with a subwoofer.\n\nThe rear seats are comfortable, and my 8- and 10-year-old kids didn’t mind riding back there one bit. There are cupholders in the floor at the rear of the center console, which is a pain for kids to reach and not usable for kids in child-safety seats. There is a good amount of legroom, though kids with their feet dangling off of a car seat may find it a bit tight. Fitting two kids across the backseat was a piece of cake. Three was OK, but only if they’re out of car seats. Otherwise, it’s a tight fit.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe Rogue has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats, and they’re easily accessible. Forward-facing child-safety seats fit fine, but rear-facing seats depend on how tall you are and your preferred seat position. At 5 feet 5 inches tall (with short legs, the denim saleslady tells me), a rear-facing car seat barely fit behind me. For kids in booster seats, the seat belt buckles are on stable bases and easy for younger kids to grasp.\n\nThe Rogue SV with the SL Package has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, an electronic stability system, traction control, active front head restraints, front and rear parking sensors, Around View Monitor and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nThe 2013 Rogue received the top score of Good in side, rear and moderate-overlap frontal crash tests and the second-highest score of Acceptable in the roof-strength crash test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It earned an overall safety score of four stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It had scores of four stars in front and rollover tests and five stars in the side crash test.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Nissan Rogue.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Nissan Rogue is handsome both outside and in, and with a starting MSRP of $21,460, it represents a good value. True to its name, though, the Rogue is a little rough around the edges. The engine has a tendency to sound like a lawnmower when it’s working hard, and the driving experience is uninspiring.\n\nDespite all that, this five-passenger crossover hits mostly high notes. The looks that it stole from its Murano sibling are probably the best things it has going for it.\n\nFor the 2011 model year, the Rogue gets a minor face-lift. It looks fresher with a new front grille, and its rear has been touched up with a redesigned liftgate and spoiler. A navigation system, USB input and automatic climate control are also available for 2011.\n\nThe Rogue lineup now includes the entry-level S trim, a saucy S Krom edition, the midlevel SV trim and the top-of-the-line SV with SL Package. Trim levels are always alphabet soup. What you need to know is that the S starts at an enticing $21,460, the S Krom is “edgy” with its sport-tuned suspension and exclusive body design, and my test car, the SV, had all-wheel drive.\n\nThe 2011 Rogue SV starts at $24,470. My test car was equipped with the Premium Package that includes a moonroof and touch-screen navigation as well as automatic headlights and temperature control. The final price of my test car was $27,105.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWe’ve established that the 2011 Nissan Rogue looks strikingly similar to Nissan’s more expensive, powerful Murano, but it also resembles a Lexus RX 350. This means the Rogue really is a nice-looking car. It’s got some snap with standard halogen headlights, body-colored side mirrors, bumpers and rear spoiler, as well as a chrome grille, door handles, license plate frame and exhaust. The roof rails also have a silver accent. Not bad for a car that starts just north of $20,000.\n\nDuring my week with the Rogue, my daughter affectionately called it “the purple car.” Coming from her, that’s the highest compliment. The precise color of my test car, a Black Amethyst, was lovely. It looked black until the sunshine hit it and it suddenly transformed into a deep, sparkling aubergine.\n\nThe step-in height was low enough to allow my 2-year-old to get in and out of the car on her own. The lightweight doors also helped in this endeavor. The rear liftgate was light and easy to handle even with one hand, but as always, I prefer a power liftgate, which isn’t available, since it’s more convenient for those of us with kids.\n\nThe 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine delivers 170 horsepower. The engine is matched to a continuously variable automatic transmission. My all-wheel-drive test car gets an EPA-estimated 22/26 mpg city/highway and uses regular gas; for better gas mileage, the front-wheel-drive Rogue gets 22/28 mpg. During my test drive, I managed to get the EPA’s combined fuel estimate of 24 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Rogue’s cabin looks great, though it belies the crossover’s low price a bit more than the stylish exterior. All of the instruments and controls are laid out intuitively and easy to use. Everything is covered in black-colored plastic with silver trim that manages to steer just clear of looking cheap. The only note of discontent in the cabin is the noise: the Rogue’s little engine that could comes through loud and clear as do all of the other cars surrounding it on the road.\n\nThe Rogue’s front and rear seats are comfortable, and the fabric upholstery manages to look nice, though don’t even think about putting a shedding dog in this car as the upholstery attracted every piece of hair and lint from miles away. There’s plenty of legroom for the driver and front passenger, even with child-safety seats installed in the backseat.\n\nEverything comes at a price, and the spacious seating for passengers comes at the expense of limited cargo space. It’s not horrible, but at just under 30 cubic feet, it’s less than most of the competition. One thing the Rogue has is a fold-flat front passenger seat. With the front passenger seat folded and the second row folded, you can get creative when hauling longer items.\n\nLike the cargo space, the remainder of the Rogue’s storage possibilities (or lack thereof) comes with mixed results. The glove box is cavernous, reaching far back and including a couple of small shelves to keep your goods organized. Aside from that and a center console that is one big bucket, there isn’t much interior storage for the small things in life. The door pockets are almost worthless and four cupholders barely fit the drinks I need for myself, let alone for the kids.\n\nThe Rogue SV that I tested also came with a number of notable standard features such as power side mirrors, a USB input for an iPod and my favorite, a backup camera, which the Rogue gets extra points for in my book.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe Rogue received the top rating of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In the roof-strength test, it received the second-best score of Average.\n\nAs in earlier model years, the 2011 Rogue still has quite a blind spot thanks to the sizable rear head restraints, rear pillars and tapered side windows. The backup camera helped me sort things out somewhat.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors that I found easy to access and use. Since my children are in either rear-facing infant or forward-facing convertible seats, I was only able to fit two of them in this car. Find out how the 2011 Rogue performed in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nAn electronic stability system, traction control, front-wheel drive and antilock brakes with brake assist are all standard on the 2011 Rogue. It also has six standard airbags, including side curtains for both rows, and active head restraints for the front row.\n\nThe Rogue has optional all-wheel drive and bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Nissan Rogue here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2011 about the 2011 Nissan Rogue. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI’ve got nothing but respect for people who look forward to spending a Saturday testing out crossovers that cost more than 20 grand; the segment has more players than a baseball team, and most blend hopelessly together. Should you take on the challenge, somewhere between Starbucks and sundown you’ll likely check out a Nissan Rogue. I suspect it will not rise above the crossover pack.\n\nThe Rogue is average across the board, but its major downside is that you can hardly see out of this thing.\n\nThe five-seat Rogue has been around since the 2008 model year, and for 2011 it gets new bumpers and a revised grille. The Rogue comes in S, SV and Krom (pronounced “chrome”) trims. All three offer front- or all-wheel drive. Compare the trims here, or stack up the 2011 and 2010 Rogue here. We tested front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the Rogue SV.\n\nStyling & Interior\nThe Rogue’s styling had been a bit anonymous, but a few exterior changes — more creases up front, extra chrome along the doors and grille — add some character. The silhouette remains the same, but it looks less bulbous now. The Krom edition adds more aggressive bumpers, a new grille, 18-inch alloy wheels and center-mounted dual tailpipes. Like its name, it’s a bit much for me.\n\nSave a crummy headliner, the cabin materials are actually quite good for this class. There’s padding where it’s needed, and panels all the way down to knee level have a decent, consistent finish. Storage areas abound, with a spacious center console and a mammoth glove compartment.\n\nUnfortunately, the overall design is plain: vast stretches of nothing, too much dull gray plastic, a steering wheel and automatic gearshift that look like they were styled by a toy company. Other interiors, from the Chevy Equinox to the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson, have inventive dashboards and eye-catching controls. The Rogue leaves no powerful impressions.\n\nA navigation system, backup camera and USB/iPod integration are new for 2011. The navigation system has a small, 5.0-inch display. Based off an SD card, it’s not as robust or quick to respond as many hard-drive-based systems, but it gets the job done. As part of a $1,700 package on the SV that also includes a moonroof and other features, it’s also relatively affordable.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nThe front seats offer better thigh and lateral support than do most crossovers, but the center console pins your knees and hips in. It gives the crossover a more carlike cockpit, which some shoppers may appreciate. If you don’t care for it, competitors like the Honda CR-V leave more space.\n\nSV models have a power driver’s seat, but Nissan doesn’t offer a telescoping steering wheel, which is becoming the norm in this segment.\n\nThe backseat has a comfortably high seating position but short lower cushions, so adults back there may notice a barstool effect: high enough seating, but too little thigh support. Headroom is good, but amenities are sparse. The Rogue offers neither rear reading lights nor a center armrest. Many competitors include both.\n\nA 60/40-split folding backseat is standard, and it provides a maximum 57.9 cubic feet of cargo space. With the seats up, there’s 28.9 cubic feet of space. Both figures generally trail the competition — the CR-V and Toyota RAV4 both have more than 70 cubic feet of maximum volume — but the Rogue is one of the few small crossovers that also have a fold-forward front passenger seat. Included on the SV, the seat enables the Rogue to accommodate narrow cargo (a ladder, for example) that’s more than 8.5 feet long, Nissan says.\n\nOut, Damned (Blind) Spot\nThe Rogue’s sight lines are its biggest problem. With bulky D-pillars, fixed rear head restraints and an undersized rear window, it ranked as the worst of 10 small crossovers — eight of which are still on the market — for blind-spot visibility in a comparison test two years ago. Large side mirrors might make up for some of that, but the Rogue’s are merely adequate — and the view out the front could use some work, too. The Rogue has more glass than the swept-back Sportage and Tucson, but its windshield and side windows are still on the short side. Nissan could learn a thing or two from the Subaru Forester or RAV4. Climb into either of those, and you’ll notice a world of difference.\n\nProficient Driving\nThe Rogue typifies the small-crossover driving experience. Its steering wheel turns with a light touch at low speeds and tracks reasonably well on the highway, and the sole drivetrain — a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission — offers adequate power. Accelerate out of a corner, and the transmission isn’t particularly quick to kick up the engine revs, as some of Nissan’s other CVTs are. Once it does, however, the Rogue scoots back up to speed well enough.\n\nOur test cars exhibited some road noise but little wind noise. Ride quality is fine overall — certainly better than the choppy Sportage and Tucson. If outright comfort is your goal, however, the Ford Escape and non-Sport RAV4 do a better job.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal ought to provide more linearity; press it down, and the first inch or so of travel brings only slight deceleration.\n\nCombined EPA mileage for the front-wheel-drive Rogue is 25 mpg. All-wheel drive drops that to 24 mpg. Those figures put the Rogue in the same company as the Equinox, Sportage and Tucson — all at the higher end of the class.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Rogue earned the top score, Good, in front, side and rear impacts. The crossover earned just an Acceptable score in roof-strength tests, which approximate rollover protection. The Rogue has not been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using its revised 2011 standards. Standard features include the usual range of front, side-impact and curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nReliability for the Rogue has been above average. Standard features on the $21,210 Rogue S include the usual power accessories, an automatic transmission, air conditioning, cruise control and a USB/iPod-compatible CD stereo. Step up to the Krom or SV, and you can get a power driver’s seat, automatic climate control, heated leather seats, a navigation system and a moonroof. All-wheel drive is optional on any trim for an affordable $1,250. Check all the options, and an all-wheel-drive Rogue SV — which, despite having a lower price than the Krom, offers more lavish options — tops out around $29,000.\n\nRogue in the Market\nSome shoppers will be put off by the Rogue’s poor sight lines, but I suspect the majority will respond to the crossover with a collective shrug. When similar money can buy a handsome interior, a vast cargo area or engaging performance, the Rogue’s unremarkable nature leaves it behind.\n\nAt last winter’s $29,000 SUV shootout, editors from Cars.com, USA Today and PBS’ “MotorWeek” noted how average the Rogue was. But when the evaluations were tallied up, the Nissan landed seventh out of nine. Average, it seems, is not good enough.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Nissan has yet another hit on its hands with the all-new Rogue.\n\nThe automaker’s first compact crossover, the Rogue competes against the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, the top two import brands in the small-crossover market.\n\nIntroduced last fall, it’s already one of the top sellers in its segment.\n\nNissan says it positioned the Rogue to appeal to men. I like it just fine, but I’d probably give it to my wife to drive as her primary vehicle – it’s not the kind of sport utility I prefer for my jaunts into the wild.\n\nMy take is that the Rogue is aimed at women, while Nissan’s more-rugged Xterra, based on the chassis of the Frontier pickup, is the one most men would prefer (although TV ads for the Xterra have featured outdoorsy women driving it).\n\nAbout 65 percent of small crossovers are sold to or for women, so Nissan is hoping that the mix between male and female buyers will be closer to a 50/50 split for the Rogue.\n\nWhile the vehicle’s soft exterior styling isn’t exactly masculine, I don’t believe men would be embarrassed to be seen driving it around.\n\nClearly, though, the Rogue’s exterior design is a break from the shape of the typical SUV. That’s also true for the midsize Nissan Murano crossover, which appeared five years ago with breakaway styling similar to that of the Rogue.\n\nIts appearance is much less-boxy than that of most of its competitors, including the RAV4, CR-V, Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner, Mazda Tribute, Mitsubishi Outlander, Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent, Saturn Vue, Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage.\n\nThe Rogue was designed to have “more styling appeal than the boxes we’ve seen in this segment,” Nissan regional product manager Mike Drongowski said.\n\nThat styling, along with the vehicle’s sporty handling characteristics, should help it appeal to male consumers more than its competitors do, he said. But he acknowledged that Nissan would consider a 50-50 split a success.\n\nIts overall look is that of a smaller Nissan Murano, a midsize crossover that also broke from the pack with its innovative, sleek styling.\n\nOne drawback in appealing to men, though, could be that the Rogue comes only with a four-cylinder engine, while most of its competitors have V-6s. In general, men put more emphasis on power than women do.\n\nBut on our test vehicle, we found the 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder to be more than adequate for everyday use, even on some mountain roads. Rated at 170 horsepower and 175 foot-pounds of torque, the engine is the same one used in the sporty version of the current Nissan Sentra compact sedan, upon whose chassis the Rogue is based.\n\nThe engine is on par with the 166-horsepower four-cylinder in the CR-V, the leading import compact crossover. As with the Rogue, no engine upgrade is offered in the Honda.\n\nWith gasoline prices hovering around $3 a gallon, Nissan expects that consumers will be more inclined to a four-cylinder engine anyway.\n\nThe Rogue’s EPA ratings are 22 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway with front-wheel drive, and 21 city/26 highway with the optional all-wheel drive.\n\nRogue prices begin just under $20,000 for the front-drive S model. But our test vehicle was the top-of-the-line SL all-wheel-drive version (base price $21,870 plus $745 freight). With options, the sticker price totaled $26,725, including freight.\n\nThe vehicle has just two rows of seats, with a capacity of five people. Some in this class now have a third row.\n\nAll-wheel drive won’t be as popular in Texas as it will be in snow country, but it has its advantages in the Sun Belt, too. It’s great for wet roads, but it also helps the vehicle hold the road in tight curves even on dry pavement.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have low-range gearing for serious off-road use, it will allow the Rogue to operate very well on most unpaved state and national park roads.\n\nIf you’re into serious off-roading, though, you’ll want the Xterra, which has a true off-road four-wheel-drive system with a two-speed transfer case.\n\nAll Rogues come with a continuously variable automatic transmission. No manual gearbox is offered, which is another clue that Nissan really is targeting this vehicle at women. Some men looking for a sporty vehicle are more likely to want a manual transmission.\n\nThe engine and transmission are the same used in the base 2007 Altima midsize sedan, as well as the sporty SE-R version of the Sentra.\n\nThe Rogue is 182.9 inches long and has a 105.9-inch wheelbase. That compares with 181.5 inches long for the RAV4, and 178.7 for the Xterra. Nissan says it’s the longest in the compact crossover segment, which translates into the roomiest interior.\n\nElectronic stability control is standard, along with four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Stability control helps prevent the vehicle from going out of control and into a potential rollover situation.\n\nAlso among the safety features are seat-mounted side air bags for the driver and front passenger, and roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for all outboard passengers.\n\nStandard are 17-inch alloy wheels, power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, tilt steering wheel, and a four-speaker AM/FM/compact-disc audio system.\n\nInside, the Rogue features large, easy-to-read instruments with reddish-orange illumination. There is a large center console, and a very large glove box.\n\nA 60/40 split-folding rear bench seat allows for expansion of the cargo area.\n\nThere is a cargo organizer in the rear that pops up from under the floor with the push of a button. It has a washable bin that is designed for wet or dirty items such as bathing suits or muddy boots.\n\nOptions on our vehicle included the premium package ($2,200), which added a Bose audio system with seven speakers and CD changer; trip computer; steering-wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls; XM satellite radio; Bluetooth hands-free phone system; intelligent-key pushbutton start; front fog lights; xenon headlights; and more.\n\nWe also had the leather package ($1,800), which brought leather seats, heated front seats, six-way power driver’s seat, HomeLink universal garage/gate opener, auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and heated outside mirrors.\n\nAlso available are a power sliding sunroof with dark gray glass, and a roof-rail system with detachable crossbars.\n\n———————-\n\n2008 Nissan Rogue\n\nThe package: Five-door, five-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive, four-cylinder, compact crossover utility vehicle.\n\nAdvantages: Nissan’s first compact crossover has edgy styling, a roomy interior, and a long list of standard amenities.\n\nNegatives: No V-6 engine upgrade offered for more power, or manual transmission for better fuel economy.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter four-cylinder.\n\nTransmission: Continuously variable automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 170 HP./175 foot-pounds\n\nLength: 182.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,267-3,460 pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted; side-curtain for both rows.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard.\n\nCargo volume: 28.9 cubic feet (behind 2nd seat).\n\nFuel capacity/type: 15.9 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city/27 highway (front-wheel drive); 21/262 (all-wheel drive).\n\nMajor competitors: Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Outback, Chevrolet Equinox, Saturn Vue, Pontiac Torrent, Jeep Compass, Jeep Patriot, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner, Mazda Tribute, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson.\n\nBase price range: $19,250-$21,870 (plus $745 freight).\n\nPrice as tested: $26,725 including freight and options (SL all-wheel-drive with premium and leather packages).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Nissan is refreshing its award-winning Rogue compact SUV for the 2024 model year with an updated face and overhauled infotainment system. A first for the brand, the new Rogue uses the Google Built-In interface.\n\nRelated: 2023 Compact SUV Challenge: It’s a Repeat Win for the Nissan Rogue\n\nFacelift, Inside and Out\n\nOutside, the new model wears an updated version of Nissan’s V-Motion grille along with redesigned taillights and badging. The SV trim also gets a new 18-inch alloy wheel design, and the Platinum variant adds gloss-black exterior trim and a new 19-inch wheel design.\n\nInside, the cabin gets refreshed with new colors, textures and trim for the door panels, seats, center console and passenger-side dashboard, plus newly available Chestnut brown leather upholstery. New standard features for the SL include a wireless device charging pad, 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.\n\nTech Updates\n\nOne of the highlights of the model-year 2023 Rogue is its easy touchscreen infotainment system, with its large knobs, responsive screen and clear menu structure. For 2024, the Rogue gets a clean-sheet redesign, with Google taking over the operating system on the uplevel SL and Platinum trims. The system uses a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen, and Nissan says it allows for seamless connection to a user’s Google account without pairing or plugging in a phone. When signed in, users can automatically access things like addresses or points of interest saved on Google Maps, as well as connect to Google Play and talk to the Google Assistant to navigate to their next destination, listen to music, or call or text a contact.\n\nOther automakers, such as GM and Acura, are also adding the Google Built-In interface on their vehicles, but with mixed results. For example, we found the system glitchy in the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado. However, Nissan says users will still be able to access the familiar Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems via a wired connection on S and SV trims and wirelessly on the SL and Platinum. And not everyone gets access to the new Google system: The S and SV trims use a standard 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which is a bit smaller than the 2023’s standard 9-inch screen.\n\nHow you will connect your phone also changes for 2024. The Rogue is the first Nissan in the U.S. to exclusively feature USB-C ports, with two front USB-C ports standard on the base S trim; SV and higher trims add two charge-only ports on the rear of the center console.\n\nAlso on the tech front for the 2024 model, SL and Platinum variants get access to the Amazon Alexa system, which gives users access to music, audiobooks and connected smart home devices via voice command.\n\nLastly, Nissan upped the free trial for its NissanConnect Services; it’s now free for three years instead of six months. The telematics system is standard on SV and higher trims and gives users access to remote door lock and unlock, remote engine stop-start, vehicle health report and emergency calling functions via an app.\n\nCarryover Powertrain\n\nThe 2024 Rogue will again be available in S, SV, SL and Platinum trims. The sole powertrain from the 2023 model carries over: a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. All trims are again available with front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Nissan Rogue goes on sale in early 2024, and there’s no word yet on pricing.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Nissan Rogue Review: The Practical Package\n2023 Nissan Rogue Strikes Midnight, Priced From $28,655\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Nissan Rogue?\nNissan Changes the Heart of the Rogue for 2022\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s hardly been a year since Nissan introduced an all-new Rogue compact SUV as a considerably changed two-row model for the 2021 model year. Bigger, better, more stylish and loaded with tech, the new Rogue topped our recent 2021 Compact SUV Challenge; it beat stalwart favorites like the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester, not to mention redesigned models like the new Hyundai Tucson and Volkswagen Tiguan. By all measures, we found it to be a perfectly executed new SUV, winning not on any exceptional merits but by Nissan simply avoiding doing anything stupid. \n\nBut then, just a year after the Rogue hit U.S. dealerships, Nissan told us it’s changing the beating heart of its SUV, swapping the old engine and transmission for a newly standard powertrain that’s more powerful, more efficient and more responsive. We had a brief spin in the 2022 Nissan Rogue with its new turbocharged engine to see if the switch improved a vehicle we already thought was top-notch. \n\nRelated:  What’s the Best Compact SUV?\n\n2022 Nissan Rogue | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nVariable Compression Tech\n\nThe 2021 Rogue, which won our contest, is powered by a rather ordinary 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 181 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission that puts power to either the front wheels or all four if you get optional all-wheel drive. That’s good for an observed 8.5-second sprint to 60 mph, which is adequate to get things moving if not exactly snappy. \n\nBut for 2022, Nissan has binned that engine for a smaller, variable-compression, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder that makes 201 hp and 225 pounds-feet of torque. That’s 11% and 24% more output, respectively, than the 2.5-liter. (Nissan reportedly offered a turbo 1.5-liter three-cylinder for a small subset of owners on the 2021 Rogue — quite possibly this engine, though the automaker has yet to confirm it.)\n\nIt also upgraded the CVT for 2022, bringing in some wider gear ratio settings aimed at improving the SUV’s responsiveness and driveability. Similar to the Altima’s variable-compression turbo 2.0-liter, the Rogue’s VC 1.5-liter can slightly adjust engine displacement in real time to maximize low-end torque around town or fuel efficiency at steady-state cruising. The lower friction and new “gear ratios” in the CVT (which doesn’t actually have any gears) are also intended to help the engine deliver power more efficiently and effectively than before.\n\nThe numbers look good for the Rogue with this new powertrain, which will deliver the most standard torque in its class — more than the CR-V or Toyota RAV4. Nissan also expects that it’s going to bump fuel economy results above the class. The automaker anticipates a 33 mpg combined rating, which is 3 mpg more than the current 2.5-liter Rogue. (Official ratings are not yet published, but the EPA has published a 32-33 mpg combined rating for the 2021 Rogue’s 1.5-liter engine.) \n\n2022 Nissan Rogue | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nZippity Ooh Ahh\n\nThe new powertrain brings an SUV that feels considerably quicker than last year’s model, thanks to a more sensitive accelerator and the engine’s dual personality. Driving around Nissan’s Technical Center North America in the griddled suburbs of Detroit, it’s obvious that the Rogue is now tuned much more for low-end torque. A light touch of the gas elicits a lot more movement than the old model delivered, and it pulls strongly through typical stop-and-go suburban driving to feel more athletic and powerful overall. \n\nThe acceleration is accompanied by a pleasant growl that’s obviously piped into the cabin, as it doesn’t exactly sound like most three-cylinder engines I’ve heard before. Engines with an odd number of cylinders are inherently imbalanced and thus have a very distinctive sound and feel. Pop the hood on the Rogue while it’s idling, and you’ll see what I mean: The engine shakes like crazy as it’s idling, but none of that vibration makes it into the cabin thanks to a lot of tuning and special motor mounts, according to Nissan. All you get is smooth power delivery and snorty exhaust noise.\n\nOn the highway, the new Rogue proves perfectly calm and respectable. It delivers plenty of grunt when called upon to do so, with the CVT adjusting quickly to accelerator inputs and allowing the engine to do its thing. The only time the new drivetrain demonstrates the limitations of having only three cylinders is during high-speed passing, where it starts to run out of steam at the upper end of its rev range. But even then, that’s an extreme case; in most situations, the Rogue’s new engine is a definite asset to the overall package. And that’s a good thing, since it’s the only powertrain you can get in the Rogue for now, at least until a rumored plug-in hybrid version appears. \n\n2022 Nissan Rogue | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nNothing Else Changes, Except the Price\n\nThe rest of the 2022 Rogue carries over unchanged, so you still have a choice of trim levels, safety equipment, interior niceties and colors. Seating comfort is still only just OK, despite Nissan’s much-ballyhooed “zero gravity” marketing silliness. The cargo area is adequately sized but a bit below the class leaders, and ride quality remains on the firm side for no clear reason. \n\nBut the pro column is still strong in the 2022 model, with an excellent multimedia system, great driver-accessible storage space, a roomy backseat and lots of nifty, modern safety and display technology throughout (with minimal touch-sensitive controls, a drawback afflicting certain Rogue rivals). Interior materials have gotten a boost with this latest version, too, especially in the top-line Platinum trim that I sampled. Pricing got a boost as well, however, with its sticker price rising $650 for front-wheel drive versions and $750 for AWD models. The least-expensive version you can get is the FWD Rogue S, at $27,875 (all prices include the destination fee), while an AWD Rogue Platinum rings in at $39,155 before the few options available. \n\nFinal pricing will be available closer to the 2022 Rogue’s appearance in showrooms sometime early this winter, but Nissan doesn’t seem to be moving it all that much — and those extra dollars bring better fuel economy and a boost to the Rogue’s overall driveability and performance. I’ll take that deal.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nLife With the Nissan Rogue: What Do Owners Really Think?\nWhich 2020 Nissan Rogue Trim Should I Buy: S, SV or SL?\n2019-2020 Nissan Rogue: Everything You Need to Know\n2019 Nissan Rogue: 10 Things We Like, 5 Things We Don’t\nResearch the Nissan Rogue\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Nissan Rogue is easily competitive on equipment and efficiency with other small crossovers, and it excels in refinement, styling and interior space.\n\nNissan’s compact crossover receives a major redo for the 2014 model year, switching to a new global platform to go after family buyers on several continents. It has a new, more aggressive look inside and out, one that is designed to project a more masculine appearance in hopes of attracting more men to the Rogue. The previous model appeals far more to women, according to Nissan’s research.\n\nWith competition in the compact crossover arena some of the hottest in the market and nearly every other competitor offering a new entry in the last two years, Nissan hopes its new model can continue the success of the old Rogue. See how the 2013 and 2014 Rogue models compare here and how the 2014 model stacks up against competitors here.\n\nStyling\nWith the new platform comes new styling, and Nissan has definitely succeeded in crafting a compact SUV that many will find appealing. The Nissan family look is in full force, with more than a passing resemblance to the bigger Pathfinder that’s evident from every angle. The look is more truckish and aggressive than its competitors, with bulging wheel arches and a bigger nose than the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. Seventeen-inch steel wheels are standard on the base S trim, with 17-inch alloy wheels standard on the midlevel SV trim and 18-inch alloy wheels standard on the topline SL trim. New LED running lights up front and angular taillights will make the Rogue distinctive even in the dark.\n\nHow It Drives\nNissan kept the Rogue’s powertrain the same: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 170 horsepower and mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive an option. This combination is fine for everyday driving in relaxed conditions, making for an uneventful commute in around-town traffic thanks to decent tuning. But ask it for any kind of acceleration beyond moderate and you’ll come up wanting more.\n\nThe CVT winds the big four-cylinder motor up to its powerband and holds it there as you hold your foot to the floor, making more noise than motion. A standard Sport mode changes the transmission’s sensitivity and its responsiveness, but it doesn’t do much for acceleration-time improvement. It’s most noticeable when entering a highway or attempting a passing maneuver; you’ll want to plan well ahead for either of those actions.\n\nThe acceleration woes are really the only blemish on what has been transformed into a wonderfully driving small crossover. Ride quality is impressively controlled, with no chop or floatiness, and even moderately sized potholes and pavement blemishes do little to upset the Rogue’s suspension. It rides like a much bigger, more expensive vehicle, with obstacles like manhole covers eliciting little more than a muted whump in the cabin.\n\nHandling is sharper than expected. The thick steering wheel is not overly boosted and delivers excellent feedback to the driver. Brakes are very strong and firm, with excellent pedal feel and no noticeable fade. Zipping down the Natchez Trace Parkway in Tennessee during my test was an entertaining experience, with little body roll, road or wind noise, and an overall feel of refinement and sophistication that is lacking in the previous generation and some of the Rogue’s competitors. It’s not as sporty and aggressive as a Mazda CX-5, but the Rogue has been tuned more toward the comfort end of the dial.\n\nFuel economy in the new 2014 Rogue is also good. The standard front-wheel-drive Rogue gets an EPA-rated 26/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined; this drops slightly for the all-wheel-drive model to 25/32/28 mpg. This puts Rogue at a combined 2 to 3 mpg advantage over a comparably equipped Ford Escape, RAV4 or CR-V, with only the smaller-engine CX-5 and CVT-equipped Subaru Forester nearly even with the Rogue.\n\nInterior\nNissan paid a lot of attention to the interior for the 2014 Rogue, creating a cabin that is inviting, attractive and comfortable for a variety of body types. Slide into the driver’s seat and the combination of command seating and low dashboard creates excellent visibility to the front and sides. Rearward visibility is still a bit challenged, becoming even more difficult when the optional third-row seats are raised.\n\nControls are mostly well-placed; the only issue comes from switch placement for the blind spot warning system and the transmission’s Sport mode — they’re low and to the left on the dash where they cannot be easily seen or touched.\n\nSeating is flexible, spacious and remarkably comfortable. Nissan continues to make hay over its so-called Zero Gravity seats that were supposedly designed with input from NASA, but regardless of their origin in Andromeda or Nissan’s Atsugi, Japan, design center, they actually deliver the promised comfort.\n\nThe second row of seats is also quite spacious at 37.9 inches, with much more legroom than expected for a compact SUV, stadium-style layout and long, tall windows for rear seat passengers that help prevent claustrophobia. The 2014 Rogue’s second-row legroom grew 2.6 inches over the 2013 model. Add in the huge panoramic sunroof overhead and the Rogue’s cabin feels tall, airy and pleasantly open. Climbing in and out of the backseat is also easier with doors that now open 77 degrees, allowing for easier placement of things like child-safety seats.\n\nNew for the Rogue this year is an optional third row of seats that’s available only on the base S and midlevel SV trim levels — if you really want a three-row crossover that tops $30,000, Nissan would instead like to show you the Pathfinder. The Rogue’s 50/50-split bench folds into the cargo area’s floor and doesn’t impact carrying capacity versus the standard Rogue when in the folded position. Given that this is a compact SUV, this is not a bench meant for adult-sized humans. If you’re planning on putting adults in the third row, try a Pathfinder. Even Nissan admits that the third row is best limited to children and over shorter distances. But with a standard second-row sliding feature that helps to equalize some legroom for all the passengers in the vehicle, it is indeed usable in a pinch.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nNot only are the interior materials better, but the interior design is improved as well. Gauges are easily visible through the steering wheel and include a 5-inch color LCD, the largest in any Nissan product, to display a variety of customizable vehicle information.\n\nThe latest all-new Nissan should have the latest all-new electronics, and the Rogue doesn’t disappoint. A full complement of information and entertainment electronics are available, including navigation, satellite radio and Bluetooth streaming audio and phone connectivity. The Rogue features not only a backup camera but Nissan’s novel Around View Monitor, which uses cameras to display a 360-degree live feed of the Rogue’s environment on the touch-screen. Nissan is introducing NissanConnect, its branded multimedia service, which integrates a number of apps from Google searches to Pandora streaming radio. NissanConnect will be updated over the vehicle’s life with new programs and features. The system doesn’t seem quite as advanced as Chevrolet’s MyLink or Ford’s MyFord Touch system, but it is easy to use and seems to work reliably well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nPop the rear hatch (a power liftgate is optional) to reveal a spacious cargo area with low bumper liftover. The second-row seats fold flat in a 40/20/40 split, and the levers are accessible with a stretch from the cargo area to unlatch the seatbacks. Fold the front passenger seat flat as well to get a cargo area reportedly able to accommodate an 8-foot ladder. For models without the third-row seat, under-floor storage is presented with two reconfigurable dividers that can also act as package shelves.\n\nNot only does the Rogue cargo volume look bigger, it actually is bigger with 39.3 cubic feet of space available behind the second row of seats versus 34.3 for the Ford Escape, 38.4 for the Toyota RAV4 and 37.2 for the Honda CR-V. Fold the rear seats down and the Rogue’s 70 cubic feet still has an advantage over the Escape (73.4), but not the CR-V (70.9) or the RAV4 (73.4). Interior overall passenger volume is also biggest — 106 cubic feet not including the third-row seats versus 98 cubic feet for the Escape and 101 for both the RAV4 and CR-V.\n\nSafety\nNissan has offered up a number of electronic systems to help with safety, including optional blind spot warning, forward collision warning, lane departure warning systems and a movement sensor that alerts a driver when the Around View Monitor detects something entering the vehicle’s vicinity. The 2014 Rogue is too new to be crash-tested, but results will appear here when this happens. Check out a list of the Rogue’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe new 2014 Rogue will be one of the least expensive compact SUVs on the market when it arrives in early 2014, starting at just $23,350, including an $860 destination fee, for an S trim model with front-wheel drive. Mitsubishi’s considerably smaller Outlander Sport is priced below that with an automatic transmission while Mazda’s CX-5 can be had with a manual transmission for less as well.\n\nNissan’s price includes standard features such as Bluetooth phone connectivity, steering-wheel audio controls, sliding and split-reclining second-row seats, backup camera and the cargo divider system. Stepping up to the midlevel SV trim adds $1,740 and a lot more content, including 17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, power seats, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and NissanConnect Apps, automatic climate control, push-button start and more. The third-row seat is optional on both the S and SV trims, but not available on the top SL trim, which rings in at $3,840 above the SV trim. The SL brings leather seats, navigation system, Bose audio, a power liftgate, heated seats and side mirrors, and 18-inch alloy wheels. Several option packages are available, including a panoramic moonroof, the third-row seating package and premium equipment packages. Adding all-wheel drive to any model bumps up the price by $1,350 regardless of trim level. See full pricing and specs for the 2014 Rogue here.\n\nThe competition in this segment is some of the hottest in the market, with almost all entries recently refreshed and selling well. The three most direct competitors will be the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, all of which are comparably priced, feature similar equipment and interior versatility. Like the RAV4 and CR-V, the Rogue offers only one powertrain; the Escape has a choice of three. The Rogue’s third row of seating does give it an advantage over competitors, but its utility is limited. The Rogue offers a more refined ride than the CR-V or RAV4, but it isn’t as sporting as the Ford Escape or the Mazda CX-5. What it does offer, however, is a more spacious backseat, one that is genuinely comfortable for real adults.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2019 Nissan Rogue is paddling as fast as it can to keep up in the red-hot compact SUV race. Feature updates and new driver-assistance tech have helped it keep pace, and it remains a leader in roominess and comfort. But time is catching up with the Rogue, which was last redesigned for the 2014 model year, and fresher rivals are showing up with much better driving manners and higher-quality interiors.\n\nThose demerits led the Rogue to finish seventh out of seven top-trim-level SUVs in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge. That said, it wasn’t far off the pace in the closely matched competition, and while it didn’t lead in any categories, it was runner-up in several, including driver-assistance and safety technology, as well as front-seat comfort. And while it was dinged for its dated interior and lackluster driving experience, a lot of compact SUV shoppers might care more about the space and comfort it offers. The 2019 Rogue is offered in base S, SV and SL trim levels, and a hybrid version is also available in SL and SV trims.\n\nLooks the Part of a Nissan SUV\n\nThe Rogue has a more traditional SUV appearance than a lot of new crossovers, and the design still has curb appeal. The tall, squarish shape is also functional, contributing to the Rogue’s ample people and cargo room. An aggressively sculpted face gets a full dose of Nissan design DNA, with a large and deep version of the family V-Motion grille and LED daytime running lights (LED headlights are available). The profile is marked by a low, dipping beltline and big wheel arches, bearing a strong resemblance to other Nissan SUVs. Large, angular taillights sit high on the corners of a busy rear end. The base S gets 17-inch steel wheels (alloys are optional), the SV gets 17-inch alloys (18s available) and the SL has 19-inch rims — the best fit for the Rogue’s big arches.\n\nRoomy and a Little Dated Inside\n\nYour first impression inside is how spacious it feels for a compact SUV. The front seats are broad and well-cushioned. They lack much lateral support, but you won’t be carving canyons in the Rogue anyway. Headroom is excellent even with the panoramic moonroof. Things aren’t economy class in the rear seat, either: It reclines and slides, so you can prioritize seating or cargo — or move a child within reach. And at 6-foot-2, I found my head didn’t brush the ceiling, nor did my knees hit the front seat behind a tall driver. Large, wide-opening doors also ease access (and getting your child into a car seat). The low beltline and big windows add an airy feel, even in versions without the big moonroof.\n\nCompact SUV competition is intense, however, and the Rogue’s interior design and materials, while pleasant enough, look dated next to rivals such as the new Toyota RAV4 and recently freshened Honda CR-V. There’s an uneven mix of materials, with the top-of-the-line SL combining an upscale stitched dashboard wrap, leather seating and piano-black trim with areas of hard plastic. Materials also drop some in the back seat, where there are more hard surfaces on the doors. Fit and finish quality, particularly with the upholstery, is just average. And the leather seating that’s standard on the SL has what Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder described as a “low-rent sheen.”\n\nMy SL test car had a heated steering wheel and heated front seats, though many competitors offer rear-seat heaters, as well. The layout of the dashboard and operation of the controls was mostly logical and easy with the exception of an odd location for the blind spot warning switch and drive mode controls; they’re down by the driver’s left knee, making them hard not just to use but even to see. The cabin is average for wind and road noise, but it loses the struggle to filter out the noisy powertrain.\n\nMultimedia and Tech\n\nThe standard 7-inch center touchscreen seems old-school these days, and so does its cluttered user interface design. It’s also positioned too far below the driver’s line of sight, but the system is easy to use and has welcome shortcut buttons, plus volume and tuning knobs. While Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, even the top SL trim has just two USB ports, one at the front of the center console and one in the console bin. If you haven’t bought a car in a while, that might seem fine, but others are more USB-generous, including charging ports for the backseat.\n\nThe Rogue had one of the first 360-degree camera systems in a compact SUV, and it’s standard on the 2019 SL, but rivals also have them now — most with sharper resolution.\n\nDrives Noisy and Slow\n\nThe Rogue’s driving manners might be OK for some buyers of compact SUVs, which no one expects to be a sports car, but even by that standard, it’s not fun to drive. Guilty parties include the Rogue’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produces 170 horsepower; that’s less motivation than most rivals, and it gave the Rogue the lowest power-to-weight ratio among the SUVs in our Challenge. It’s mated to a raucous continuously variable automatic transmission that has rubber-band lag at start-up and in passing, and it howls like it’s being injured when you mash your foot for more power — which is often with this engine. As Cars.com Senior Research Editor Mike Hanley put it, “Droning engine noise is your constant companion when driving the Rogue.”\n\nIf there were a stronger powertrain, you still wouldn’t be tempted to push the Rogue. Even moderately hard cornering or evasive maneuvers bring out lots of body lean and tire scrub. In return, however, you get a soft, compliant ride. Despite the body motion, it might be a worthy tradeoff if your commute is on rough city streets. The steering is very light, and the brakes feel soft and are slow to react to more pedal pressure, while the chassis allows considerable nose dive on hard braking.\n\nThe Rogue is among the leaders in the compact SUV category when it comes to EPA gas mileage ratings: 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD (27 mpg combined with AWD). That’s close to the 30 mpg combined estimate for front-drive 2019 versions of both the RAV4 and the CR-V (with its more efficient engine). Compare them here. In real-world testing during our Challenge, however, Rogue gas mileage was well behind those two; it tied for last in the Challenge.\n\nFor better mileage, the Rogue offers a gas-electric hybrid version of the top two trim levels, which I did not test. The hybrid system uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor, making for a net output of 174 hp with front- or all-wheel drive. It’s EPA-rated at 33/35/34 mpg city/highway/combined (33 mpg combined with AWD). That compares well to the 2018 RAV4 Hybrid AWD, but it’s no match for the redesigned 2019 RAV4 Hybrid, which gets an estimated 40 mpg combined with its 219-hp hybrid system and standard AWD. Compare them here.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nAs with its roomy seating, the Rogue shines when it comes to cargo room. It offers 39.3 cubic feet behind the rear seat 70 cubic feet with the backseat folded. That’s in a league with the capacious CR-V (39.2 and 75.8) and the RAV4 (37.6 and 69.8). And the Rogue has more flexibility, with a 40/20/40, split-folding backrest (though the center section doesn’t fold flat with the floor) and a front passenger seat that folds rearward to help fit longer items. The rear cargo area has storage space under the floor and features a cargo system that can be configured for multiple floor heights, an upper cargo shelf or divided space. You might find the configurations helpful, but I’m not sure how much I would use them. Also, the plastic supports for the system on the sides of the cargo area will get in your way when you want maximum open space. A hands-free power liftgate is standard on the SV and SL.\n\nI wanted more and better cabin storage space for smaller items so I could save the cupholders for cups. There are small door pockets (very small in the rear doors) and a smallish center console bin. There’s also a shallow space at the front of the center console where you might put a phone, but it’s neither the shape nor the size of a phone.\n\nUp-to-Date Safety and Driver Aids\n\nThe Rogue earned top scores in five Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests; it has not yet undergone the difficult passenger-side small overlap front crash test. The standard front crash prevention system with automatic emergency braking earned the agency’s top score, and the LED headlights that are optional on the SL rated acceptable. The standard headlights for all trim levels, however, were rated poor.\n\nThe 2019 Rogue meets or beats even its newest rivals in the latest safety and driver-assistance tech. Standard on all Rogues is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, as is lane departure warning, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. New for 2019 is rear automatic braking and rear parking sensors for SV and SL trim levels.\n\nAlso standard on the SL (and optional on the SV) is Nissan’s excellent ProPilot Assist driver aid system that combines adaptive cruise control with stop and go and an advanced lane-centering system. It handles acceleration, braking and steering in highway driving with marked lanes. There are similar capabilities in some other compact SUVs, but Nissan’s system is one of the simplest to use — and the most reliable. Just press the blue ProPilot button on the steering wheel and set the cruise control speed and you’re good to go. A dashboard graphic and alert clearly let you know when it’s engaged or disengaged.\n\nForgetful people and busy parents will appreciate the 2019 Rogue’s new standard rear door alert, which reminds you to check the backseat once you’ve parked if either rear door was used when you departed (if you haven’t already reopened it after stopping). It starts out with a dashboard message, like similar systems, but escalates to horn chirps if you don’t respond. The Rogue also rates well for accommodating child-safety seats. See Cars.com’s 2019 Rogue Car Seat Check.\n\nPricing and Value\n\nThe 2019 Rogue starts at $25,965 for the base S with front-wheel drive (all prices include destination fees). It has more standard features — including advanced safety tech — than a 2019 CR-V LX ($25,395 with FWD) and matches up well on features with a 2019 RAV4 LE ($26,595). Pricing ranges up to the AWD SL trim ($33,785) versus a CR-V Touring AWD ($35,195) or a RAV4 Limited AWD ($35,995). You can compare the Rogue’s features by trim level with these rivals here. Hybrid Rogues range from the SV with FWD (starting at $28,645) to the SL with AWD ($33,935).\n\nThe practical and roomy 2019 Rogue isn’t a bad choice if its best points match what you most value — and if you get a good price. The competition is close, but several newer rivals are better than merely OK. They should get a look before you buy.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2021 Nissan Rogue adds much-needed driving refinement, though it comes with a bothersome side of ride firmness. \n\nVersus the competition: Return shoppers will miss the outgoing Rogue’s soft ride, but firm suspension tuning never stopped a compact SUV from selling like gangbusters. Other aspects run the gamut, and our overall impression is two steps forward, one step back.\n\nRedesigned for 2021 with running lights spaced high above the headlights — a look popularized by the old Juke and, now, a smattering of Hyundai models — the Nissan Rogue comes in four trim levels: S, SV, SL and Platinum. Each offers front- or all-wheel drive; compare the trims here or stack up the 2021 and 2020 Rogue here. Don’t confuse it with the Rogue Sport, a smaller model based on a separate platform. All trim levels pair a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a continuously variable automatic transmission. We evaluated a Rogue SV AWD.\n\nRelated: Redesigned Nissan Rogue Shows Up Tougher-Looking, Tech-Packed for 2021\n\nImproved Road Manners, Mostly\n\nCompetitors steadily surpassed the outgoing (2014-20) Rogue in the all-important battleground of ride and handling. When we compared Nissan’s compact SUV against the field in late 2017, it ranked mid-pack in ride quality and last, by a mile, in handling. The redesigned Rogue makes significant strides on the latter front, with a quick enough steering ratio for precise directional adjustments as you negotiate sweeping on-ramps. Nissan dialed back much of the prior generation’s nose-heaviness and numb steering, too. Steering and dynamics aren’t exactly towering strengths for the new Rogue, but they’re far from liabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, that comes at a cost: The suspension introduces a degree of impact harshness over potholes and sewer covers that the outgoing Rogue dispatched with minimal complaint. Nissan says suspension tuning is the same across all trim levels, and our SV test car had 18-inch wheels (S trims have 17s, but the SL and Platinum have 19s, which may ride harsher still). Overall isolation and body control are fine, but the shock firmness is puzzling, given the Rogue’s comfort-oriented history. Perhaps Nissan benchmarked the current-generation Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, two popular but firm-riding rivals. In any case, the pendulum has swung both ways at Nissan: The recent Sentra redesign stays fittingly soft, while the current-generation Altima skews firm.\n\nThe 2021 Rogue gets the same 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine from that Altima (here it makes 181 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque), rejiggered from an earlier 2.5-liter that preceded it. Paired with a CVT that raises revs fast enough from a standing start, the 2.5-liter provides enough power around town but needs most of its reserves to reach highway speed, especially with multiple occupants aboard. If you need more power while already in motion, the CVT again increases engine rpm quickly enough. It’s slightly quicker in a driver-selectable Sport mode, but that setting keeps revs awkwardly high all the time — not simply hastening the transition, as effective Sport modes often do.\n\nThe Interior: Quality and Utility\n\nRife with all the trending elements in today’s automotive interiors, the Rogue’s cabin features a floating touchscreen, electronic gear selector and high center console, plus lots of stitched dash and door surfaces. Quality mostly lives up, with generous padding where your arms rest and a sturdy grade of fabric upholstery in our test car. Cost-cutting becomes evident once you get to the backseat — the norm in this class, though a few rivals improve on it. Leatherette (vinyl) and leather are both optional, and upper trims pad where your knees meet the console. That’s a useful provision, as its bulky design inhibits some lateral space. Nissan’s spring-loaded electronic gear selector feels a bit rickety to operate, but it’s a rare blemish among otherwise high-quality controls.\n\nInterior storage is in good supply. With no mechanical linkage to select gears, the center console has a medium tray underneath, plus multiple cubbies around the cupholders. Gone is the outgoing Rogue’s deep glove compartment, but the other nooks more than make up for it. Unfortunately, utility behind the front seats takes, well, a slight backseat. The rear seats lose the outgoing Rogue’s 40/20/40-split, reclining functionality and sliding adjustment, the latter of which allowed owners to maximize cargo or passenger space; now the seat just reclines in a traditional 60/40 split. Legroom is fine, but the bench sits a bit closer to the floor than before, such that some adults may find their knees uncomfortably elevated.\n\nWe measured 17.1 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat in our Rogue SV, and that’s with a fixed cargo floor. SL and Platinum grades get Nissan’s Divide-N-Hide cargo system, which has a dual-level load floor that should add slight volume. In any case, the SV’s room lands within fighting range of others (we measured 18.7 cubic feet in a Toyota RAV4 Prime, for example). Note that it comes by way of our independent accounting of cargo space, a practice we’ve instituted amid inconsistent methodology from manufacturer-reported volumes.\n\nTechnology and Safety\n\nThe Rogue’s standard 8-inch touchscreen has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both via tethered connections, and two USB ports. Tech options include two additional backseat USB ports and an upsized (9-inch) touchscreen with wireless CarPlay, plus 12-inch virtual gauges, wireless smartphone charging and a Bose premium stereo. (Android Auto is strictly a tethered connection; no wireless connectivity is available.)\n\nAs of this writing, third-party crash tests have yet to be published for the 2021 Rogue. Standard safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection as well as blind spot and lane departure warning systems. Nissan’s ProPilot Assist system, included on the SV grades and up, incorporates adaptive cruise control with hands-on lane-centering steering, both of which work from a stop all the way up to highway speeds. Note that this isn’t the automaker’s second-generation ProPilot Assist with hands-free lane centering, which debuted on the new Ariya SUV.\n\nFeatures and Pricing\n\nIncluding destination, the 2021 Rogue starts just under $27,000. That’s a stone’s throw from its predecessor, and in the thick of its rivals’ starting prices. Characteristic of the class, it’s well equipped on the safety and multimedia fronts but basic beyond that: Rogue S shoppers can expect manual seats, cloth upholstery, manual climate control and basic keyless entry.\n\nClimb the trim levels, and you can get a panoramic moonroof, hands-free power liftgate, vinyl or leather seats, keyless access, power front seats (though without a passenger height adjustment), tri-zone climate control and heated seats in both rows. A loaded Rogue Platinum AWD tops out in the high $30,000s, which is also competitive.\n\nShould You Buy One?\n\nNaturally, the Rogue’s improved agility is a modest adjustment to what it once was; this is no sports car masquerading as an SUV. The improvements come at some expense to comfort, and the utility setup takes half a step backward. But the SUV takes more steps forward, and it doesn’t come with a huge jump in price. In balance, it’s a notably better SUV than the one it replaces — something shoppers who don’t prioritize comfort or utility can appreciate.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Nissan Rogue a Good SUV?\n\nThe Nissan Rogue has won three consecutive times when we’ve compared it with other compact SUVs, including a win for the 2025 Rogue in our latest faceoff. So, yeah, we’d say it’s a pretty good SUV — though its higher trims can get extraordinarily pricey.\n\nHow Does the Nissan Rogue Compare With Other Compact SUVs?\n\nThe 2025 Rogue combines class-leading interior comfort, quality and driver-assist features with a knack for never landing below the middle of the pack in any metric we rate it on. In short, it doesn’t do anything badly.\n\nThe compact SUV class is one of the most popular in the U.S. based on sales volume. The Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V were both in the top five for 2024 sales, and the Nissan Rogue made it into the top 10. Given the popularity of these vehicles, it only made sense to compare a sampling of them, and you can read the full results of our seven-SUV test below.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\n\nThe winner of the last two of these comparisons, the Rogue, entered our 2025 test in all-wheel-drive Platinum form, which is a top-of-the-line trim. In our prior two comparison tests, the Rogue had no apparent weaknesses, racking up a number of category wins and logging not a single loss. When I saw the price of our test vehicle this time around, though, I was worried: Including destination fee, this Rogue was priced at $48,330 — and those are pre-tariff dollars. Nissan has since rolled Rogue prices back a little; the model we tested would be “only” roughly $47,000 assuming no other changes to option pricing, but that’s still a lot of money for a two-row compact SUV.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nFor 2025, the Rogue added a rugged-looking Rock Creek trim, as well as an available ProPilot Assist 2.1 system, which offers hands-free cruise control on certain premapped highways. A newly enhanced 360-degree camera system can be equipped to display Nissan’s Invisible Hood View, which allows drivers to see “through” their Rogue to the ground in front of them. The sole powertrain remains a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine that makes 201 horsepower and 225 pounds-feet of torque and pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. All trims are available with either front-wheel drive or AWD, except the AWD-only Rock Creek.\n\nDoes the 2025 Rogue Platinum do enough to justify its relatively astronomical price? Read on to find out.\n\nHow Good Is the 2025 Nissan Rogue’s Interior?\n\nThe interior is the Rogue’s strongest attribute. The Platinum is very nicely appointed on the inside, with an upmarket feel that helps justify its high price. The upholstery and trim are luxurious, and there’s barely a dropoff in quality from the front seats to the back. Both rows of seats are comfortable, even when both are occupied. Backseat passengers in the Platinum get the added benefit of their own climate controls and integrated side window sunshades when the car is equipped with the Platinum Premium Package ($990) that ours had.\n\nOn top of that, the Rogue’s physical controls are intuitive and have a pleasing aesthetic: piano-black buttons in a piano-black panel, giving the whole setup a clean one-piece look. The SUV’s 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Google Built-In usually works well (some editors experienced glitches) and is also intuitive, and the configurable 12.3-inch digital instrument panel provides a lot of useful information without overloading the driver.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Nissan Rogue Drive?\n\nWhere the Rogue’s interior is exemplary, the driving experience is notable for a different reason: This Nissan rarely makes an unforced error. Other compact SUVs have numb steering or a too-firm suspension or a lazy powertrain, or, or, or. The Rogue does absolutely nothing wrong on the road. Power from the three-cylinder turbo is perfectly adequate; engine and transmission noise are never grating; and the CVT does a good enough job pretending to be a traditional automatic transmission — meaning it’s unobtrusive. Ride quality is also very composed — neither too sporty nor too soft — and body control is good, too. The steering feel is adequate; it’s not impressively communicative, but it’s not so numb that you don’t know what the tires are doing. The Rogue won’t keep up with Mazda’s more powerful SUVs, and it doesn’t have the relative fun factor of a Honda CR-V, but it’s not far behind.\n\nFuel economy is also relatively good. Unlike many vehicles in its class, the Rogue is not available as a hybrid, so — at least in its current form — it will never be the segment’s efficiency champion. It is, however, rated at up to 33 mpg combined with FWD and 31 mpg combined with AWD (the Rock Creek gets 29 mpg). In our fuel economy testing, the Rogue was the second most efficient SUV among the non-hybrid models we compared, with observed gas mileage of 30.8 mpg. In this class, adequate power and efficiency is a winning combination.\n\nHow Are the 2025 Nissan Rogue’s Driver-Assist Features?\n\nThis category is where our test Rogue’s value proposition starts to take a hit. The vehicle we drove was equipped with a $3,200 Technology Package, which does two things: It adds Nissan’s ProPilot Assist 2.1, which gives you the ability to use hands-free semi-autonomous driving on certain stretches of highway, and it also adds enhanced camera views for the vehicle’s 360-degree camera system, including the Invisible Hood View.\n\nOptions are a personal preference, but I’m inclined to say skip this one. I’ve found similar hands-free driving systems useful on lengthy road trips, but I don’t consider them a must-have feature, and Nissan’s doesn’t do anything particularly different. The same can be said of Invisible Hood View; it would be useful in off-roading situations — which are situations no one in a Rogue Platinum is likely to regularly encounter — or if parking logs or other low obstacles are problematic, but I’m going to go ahead and say “skill issue” on those ones.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nNissan Cuts Pricing on 2025 Rogue, Pathfinder SUVs\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Nissan Rogue?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in the 2025 Nissan Rogue?\nResearch the 2025 Nissan Rogue\nFind a New Nissan Rogue for Sale Near You\nIs the 2025 Nissan Rogue a Good Value?\n\nThis is a good question with a complicated answer. The Rogue was not the winner in the Value category of our comparison test, but it did finish third out of seven SUVs — despite having the highest as-tested price. And given its other strengths, the Rogue was our overall winner, making a strong argument that, even at nearly $50,000, it’s a good value. If that’s your conclusion, it’s a good one.\n\nMy conclusion is less rosy. A search of SUVs with prices between $45,000 and $50,000 turns up a wealth of roomier three-row models, including our Best of 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe with a hybrid powertrain in its top Calligraphy trim. Even some base luxury compact SUVs like the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Genesis GV70 fall into that category. In this price range, there are plenty of alternatives that might be better long-term choices — my family of three plus a dog, for example, is close to outgrowing a compact SUV — as well as ones where you might feel less like you have to justify the price.\n\nIf I had to buy a Rogue, I’d skip the Technology Package and all the lighting options on our test vehicle, saving $4,580 and lowering its as-tested price to a still-high, but more palatable, $43,750, not counting Nissan’s recent price reductions. Factor those in, and your Rogue Platinum would come in under $43,000, making it feel like a better value to me.\n\nThe Rogue’s pricing is its biggest weakness, but it’s still the best all-around choice in the most competitive vehicle class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Major changes to the 2017 Nissan Rogue include revised styling, some interior updates and more noise insulation. Compare the 2017 and 2016 Rogue here. The SUV comes in S, SV and SL trim levels, all with front- or all-wheel drive (compare the trim levels here). We cover the Rogue Hybrid, which is new for 2017, on a separate page.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nSlapped with the same V-Motion grille that adorns just about every Nissan these days, the Rogue’s mass of chrome bars, bumper lines, piano-black framework and LED headlight accents look busier than a double oven on Thanksgiving morning. I much prefer last year’s simpler face. Less has changed in back, where the Rogue’s taillights still imitate a mid-2000s Lexus RX. It’s fine.\n\n$$IMAGE-1,3,4,5$$\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLike most of its peers, the 2.5 liter, four-cylinder Rogue has adequate power. The standard continuously variable automatic transmission has some telltale nonlinearity, though: Step on the gas and the engine takes a while to rev up, which is typical of a CVT. But press the gas harder and it mimics a conventional automatic transmission with upshifting and downshifting sensations — contrivances to make it seem less like a CVT, of course, but convincingly executed nonetheless.\n\nNissan does not offer a punchier engine option as some competitors do. Likewise, its 1,000-pound trailer capacity is also a nonstarter if you plan to tow much. If you want more hustle, compact SUVs from Ford, GM, Hyundai-Kia, Subaru and Volkswagen all have V-6 or turbo four-cylinder choices, and some of them tow considerably more. A few (particularly the Ford Escape) also out-handle the Rogue, which has unremarkable dynamics and low-effort but vague steering.\n\nThere’s payoff in comfort, at least. Our SL test car’s P225/55R19 tires had taller sidewalls than you typically get with 19-inch wheels, which automakers often pair with low-profile tires that have all the bump absorption of a wagon axle. On the Rogue, sensible tires and a comfort-oriented suspension dispatch potholes as well as you can expect in a small SUV. Highway isolation is good, too, with little road and wind noise to boot.\n\n$$IMAGE-6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13$$\n\nInterior\n\nGussied up for 2017 with a new steering wheel and some nicer cabin trim, the new Nissan Rogue boasts decent interior quality for its class. Materials are lush where it counts, with generous soft-touch surfaces in all the areas your arms and elbows land, attractive double-stitched dashboard trim, piano-black accents and even some knee padding along the center console in upper trim levels. I’m less enthralled with the SL’s optional quilted leather seats, which lack much thigh support and, in many areas, don’t even feel like real leather. The optional power driver’s seat lacks a bottom cushion angle adjustment, and the Rogue still doesn’t offer a power passenger seat — a feature increasingly available among its rivals.\n\nAll versions get a Swiss army knife of a backseat, which folds in a 40/20/40 split plus reclines and slides forward and back — a rare feature in the segment that’s useful if you want to add some cargo space or pull a child in a car seat closer. Taller passengers will appreciate that the bench both sits high off the floor and leaves decent headroom. A two-seat third row is optional, but we haven’t tested it. So is a foot-activated power liftgate and a panoramic moonroof.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nIn models without the third row, the Nissan Rogue’s Divide-N-Hide storage system provides a nifty way to organize the 32 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat. With two partitions and 18 adjustable configurations, it enables you to maximize cargo height, keep a flat load floor, set up a shelf to stack cargo on two tiers or even create a standing box that hides items from sight. Fold the seats down and the Rogue has a competitive 70 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. Models with the third row have a slim 9.4 cubic feet behind it.\n\n$$IMAGE-14,15$$\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nA 5-inch multimedia display with a backup camera, satellite radio, and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming is standard, but the multimedia options beyond that are generally disappointing. The optional 7-inch screen seems a tad small where competitors are pushing units 8 inches or larger. The display graphics are run-of-the-mill and the available navigation system lacks pinch-to-zoom map functionality — something several competitors offer. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, readily available among Rogue rivals, are missing. And there’s just one USB port. If your passengers need to charge their devices, you’ll have to hunt down a 12-volt adapter.\n\nA couple of pluses: The Rogue still offers Nissan’s Around View Monitor, a helpful 360-degree camera system that’s rare in the segment. And either multimedia screen has plenty of physical buttons and knobs — something fast disappearing among cars of all stripes in the name of multimedia “advancements.” (Take a wild guess how I feel about them.)\n\nSafety\n\nThe Nissan Rogue earned top scores in crashworthiness tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, including excellent scores in IIHS’ evaluation of its optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. That system accompanies the Rogue’s optional adaptive cruise control. Also optional are blind spot, and lane departure warning and prevention systems, the latter of which can nudge you back into your lane if you stray.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe front-drive Nissan Rogue base price starts around $25,000 including destination. All-wheel drive runs an affordable $1,350 on any trim, and a Rogue SL thus equipped tops out in the mid-$30,000s. That’s a typical range for the class — a crowded class, I might add. Nearly every non-luxury automaker has a direct competitor to the Rogue, and some have two or three. Still, the Rogue’s ubiquity is deserved. Nissan’s compact SUV checks a lot of boxes for small families, with above-average reliability to boot. If you’re shopping for a small SUV, it’s a worthy contender.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Rogue family continues to expand. After the off-road-oriented Rock Creek trim level debuted for the 2025 model year, the new Rogue Dark Armor joins the compact SUV’s lineup for 2026; the rest of the Rogue lineup, however, is unchanged. The 2026 Nissan Rogue starts at $30,180 (all prices include $1,390 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Nissan Rogue Review: Keeping the Compact SUV Crown\n\nWhat Does the 2026 Rogue Dark Armor Include?\n\nThe Dark Armor is similar in concept to the wave of black- and “night”-themed editions cresting across the industry, with a differently evocative name. It slots in below the SL trim level and gets gloss-black exterior accents and 19-inch wheels, as well as satin-black roof rails. Unlike many other such packages, though, the Dark Armor also includes more content, namely a panoramic moonroof, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Nissan Rogue is on sale now, and pricing for most trims is below. All-wheel drive on the S, SV and SL trims is an additional $1,400; the Rock Creek and Platinum come as AWD-only. The pricing and release date for the Dark Armor will be announced later.\n\nS: $30,180\nSV: $31,180\nRock Creek: $35,080\nSL: $36,680\nPlatinum: $40,380\n\nIn April, Nissan took the unusual step of lowering prices on the Rogue (and the larger Pathfinder) mere months after announcing them. For 2026, prices for each trim level land between the original and revised figures.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Nissan Rogue’s Trim Levels?\n\nExterior features of the entry-level Rogue S include 17-inch wheels, LED front and rear lighting, automatic high beams, and remote keyless entry. Inside, you’ll find cloth seating, manually adjustable front seats, four speakers and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and voice recognition.\n\nRogue buyers enjoy a steady drip of additional safety tech as they climb the trim-level ladder. Standard systems on the entry-level S include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, a driver attention monitor and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe SV upgrades to 18-inch wheels and includes a power liftgate, keyless entry and start, remote start, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control and six speakers. The SV also adds adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist and blind spot intervention.\n\nRiding on dark 17-inch wheels wearing all-terrain tires, the Rock Creek gets a unique front bumper and hill descent control to aid in rough-road travels. It also adds heating elements to the side mirrors and front seats and is upholstered in synthetic leather. A 360-degree camera system joins the roster on the Rock Creek.\n\nThe SL makes a big leap into luxury territory with 19-inch wheels, genuine leather seating, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, wireless phone charging and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, navigation, Google Built-In and Amazon Alexa Built-In. It also supplements the standard rear parking sensors with front and side sonar and adds ProPilot Assist 1.1, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering (ProPilot Assist 2.1, Nissan’s hands-free semi-autonomous highway driving tech, is optional on the SL and Platinum).\n\nAt the top of the Rogue line, the Platinum adds a panoramic moonroof, quilted and perforated semi-aniline leather and a 10-speaker Bose sound system.\n\nRead More About the Nissan Rogue:\n\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $15,000?\nWhat’s the Most Fuel-Efficient SUV?\nIIHS Crash-Tests 11 More Vehicles, 3 Earn Top Safety Pick+ Awards\nResearch the Nissan Rogue\nWhat Are the 2026 Nissan Rogue’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nEvery Nissan Rogue is powered by a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine with 225 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on the S, SV and SL, with AWD optional; AWD is standard on the Rock Creek and Platinum.\n\nNissan says front-drive 2026 Rogues are rated at 29/36/32 mpg city/highway/combined. With AWD, most Rogue trim levels return 28/35/31 mpg (official EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The Rock Creek’s all-terrain tires cost it a few mpg, though; its fuel economy lands at 27/32/29 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Nissan Rogue is an outstanding all-around family-hauler, aided by smart packaging, an economical and surprisingly refined three-cylinder engine, and several thoughtful features — though it does get pricey in its top trim.\n\nVersus the competition: Thanks to its well-rounded nature, the Rogue stacks up exceptionally well against class competitors. It nabbed the top spot in our 2023 Compact SUV Challenge, backing up its first-place finish in our previous comparison test.\n\nAs one of the most popular and hotly contested vehicle classes in today’s new-car marketplace, the mainstream compact SUV category offers a fair amount of variety. Want gutsier acceleration and sharper handling than the class norm? Check out a Ford Escape or Mazda CX-5 or CX-50, which boast crisp cornering capabilities and strong available turbocharged engines. Looking to do some off-the-beaten-path adventuring? The Jeep Compass Trailhawk and Subaru Forester Wilderness are optimized for traversing rough terrain. Concerned about fuel economy? The Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, and Toyota RAV4 all offer hybrid powertrains, and the Escape, Tucson, Sportage, RAV4 and Mitsubishi Outlander also come as plug-in hybrids. But if what you want is simply a well-rounded compact SUV that excels at a wide variety of everyday tasks — and delivers a convincingly luxurious experience in its top trim level — the Nissan Rogue is, perhaps, the best choice in the class.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV of 2023?\n\nOther than a Midnight Edition blackout-trim package and available Amazon Alexa functionality, the Rogue is unchanged for the 2023 model year. It was redesigned from the ground up for 2021, and Nissan replaced its naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine with a turbocharged three-cylinder for 2022. We recently tested a 2023 Rogue Platinum against five other compact SUVs — a Ford Escape ST-Line Elite, Honda CR-V EX-L, Hyundai Tucson Limited, Kia Sportage X-Pro Prestige and Mazda CX-50 Turbo Premium Plus — in Palm Springs, Calif., and thanks in part to its jack-of-all-trades personality, the Rogue finished first.\n\nAiry Cabin\n\nThough the Rogue’s overall dimensions are average for the class. It feels airier inside than most of its rivals, with a tall roofline and generously sized windows all around. The large windshield and thin windshield pillars provide a panoramic view from the driver’s seat, and the view to the rear is better than the norm, as well. Extra-tall occupants have headroom to spare in both the front and rear seats even under the panoramic moonroof that comes standard on SL and Platinum trims. (Sunroof housings usually steal an inch or so of head space.) Our editors found the seating position both front and rear to be just right — not too high, not too low. Another much-appreciated detail: The front-seat sunshades are extra large and fully adjustable, extending to cover the entire upper portion of the front windows.\n\nThe rear seats are especially easy to access, a particularly helpful feature for parents getting little ones into and out of car seats. The door openings themselves are generously sized, and the hinges allow the doors to open almost 90 degrees. The backseat is just wide enough for three-abreast seating for kids or smaller adults. Average-height adults will have adequate legroom, thanks in part to the Rogue’s relatively small, unobtrusive center driveline hump; very tall people, though, might wish for a little more space if the front seats are adjusted all the way back. Unlike some class competitors, the Rogue’s rear seatbacks don’t recline, but that’s not a big issue thanks to the bountiful headroom.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nClever Cargo Solutions\n\nThe Rogue’s rear cargo area is among the more spacious in its class, and thoughtful convenience touches abound. The powered, hands-free rear liftgate is reasonably quick to open and close, and the opening itself is nice and wide with a fairly low load floor. The Platinum trim has rear seatback release levers in the cargo area so you don’t have to walk around to the rear doors to fold down those seats. So long as the front seats aren’t adjusted way back with their seatbacks reclined, the rear seatbacks can be folded without removing the head restraints.\n\nNissan’s clever Divide-N-Hide configurable cargo panels, which are standard on the SL and Platinum, can be set to a lower level than the standard cargo floor to free up a few more inches of vertical space. They can also be installed vertically if you want to partition the cargo floor, and a handy pocket on the passenger side of the rear cargo area is sized just right for a gallon of milk. (Take it from a guy who once had a glass bottle of cold-brew coffee concentrate roll out of its bag and shatter in the back of an SUV: Side pockets and partitionable cargo areas are good things.)\n\nIn the seating area, the bottle holders and pockets built into the front and rear door panels aren’t particularly large, but the Rogue’s small-items storage is otherwise quite good. The wireless charging pad is easily accessible at the front of the center console, and there’s an open purse shelf below the console. The console storage bin itself is large and deep, and its side-hinged “bomb bay” door design makes it easier for backseat passengers to access. The padding on those doors could be a bit cushier, though; my right elbow often landed right on the seam between the doors.\n\nClassy Interior Trimmings\n\nIn Platinum form, the Rogue’s interior ambiance and features compare well with the fanciest offerings in the compact SUV class; in our comparison test, it was bested only by the Mazda CX-50 Premium Plus. The Rogue’s top Platinum trim gets several premium features that bring the cabin to a near-luxury level, including diamond-quilted semi-aniline leather upholstery, a 10-speaker Bose premium audio system, Amazon Alexa connectivity, a 12.3-inch configurable digital gauge panel, and adaptive cruise control that’s linked to the navigation and lane departure steering assist systems.\n\nOur test vehicle was also equipped with a Platinum Premium Package ($620), which adds a feature-rich 10.8-inch head-up display, heated rear seats and tri-zone climate control. The Rogue was the only vehicle in our comparison test with the latter feature, and it was also the only one with pull-up rear window sunshades, which come standard on Midnight Edition and Platinum trims and are available in a Premium Package on all but the base model. Dual USB charging ports (one USB-A and one USB-C, both in the center console) and bright LED reading lights are other welcome backseat amenities. The front seats are cushy and comfortable, but one of my favorite features is missing: Ventilated front seats are unavailable on any Rogue.\n\nAgreeable Control Layout, Helpful Tech Features\n\nThe Rogue’s user interface is another strong point; it tied with the Kia Sportage for first place in our comparison test. The control layout keeps almost everything within easy reach, and Nissan thankfully steers clear of touch-sensitive controls, which we often find finicky and distracting to use while driving. The available 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster boasts attractive, easy-to-read graphics, and you can toggle between helpful displays such as fuel-economy data and navigation maps. The 9-inch infotainment touchscreen isn’t the biggest display in the class (the Ford Escape, for one, boasts an optional 13.2-inch screen), but the system itself is logically laid out and easy to use.\n\nThe unconventional sliding gear selector might feel a bit awkward at first, but I acclimated to it easily: forward for Reverse, backward for Drive, and press a button to engage Park. Higher-trim Rogues get a comprehensive suite of safety features; the only ones it lacked versus other SUVs in our test were adaptive headlights and a blind spot camera system. Happily, the Rogue’s lane departure warning system uses a quick vibration through the steering wheel (like a smartphone notification) to alert the driver instead of a shrill electronic beep.\n\nSurprising Pep from Three Cylinders, But That’s All You Get\n\nIf you see the words “three cylinders” and think “wheezing, weak-kneed engine,” don’t. The Rogue’s turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder puts out a healthy 201 horsepower, about 15-20 hp more than the base engines of most competing SUVs. It takes a second for the turbocharger to spool up and deliver optimal power, but acceleration is surprisingly punchy once it does, at least in around-town driving. The engine is also paired quite nicely to its continuously variable automatic transmission. The CVT is quick to respond to throttle inputs, and it’s programmed to mimic the gear changes of a conventional automatic, which mitigates the high-rev droning sound that some CVTs exhibit.\n\nThree-cylinder engines typically don’t sound or feel very refined, but the Rogue’s three-cylinder is smooth and hushed enough that the Rogue came out on top in the quietness category of our comparison test. Some drivers might not even notice it has one fewer cylinder than the typical compact SUV. Engine noise is nicely muffled overall, though a bit of “bumblebee buzz” intrudes in fast acceleration or when the engine is spinning at higher revolutions. And the Rogue did need to work pretty hard to climb the steep, twisty canyon roads of our test route; the engine can run out of steam at higher speeds, so the buzzy exhaust note was a constant companion on those ascents.\n\nThe Rogue’s three-banger also does pretty well in terms of fuel economy. The Rogue Platinum with all-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 28/34/31 mpg city/highway/combined, and it averaged 29.3 mpg in our real-world fuel-economy test, second only to the Escape. As good as the Rogue’s engine is, however, it’s all you can get. There’s no spicier optional engine as with the Escape’s 250-hp, EcoBoost 2.0-liter or the CX-50’s 256-hp, turbo 2.5-liter, nor is there a hybrid or PHEV powertrain option — at least not yet.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe Rogue’s weakest category in our comparison test was handling, but even there it landed about mid-pack. It corners capably and predictably, with communicative steering that’s nicely balanced for everyday driving. If you’re looking to regularly hustle along curvy roads, though, there are better choices. The Rogue’s ride quality is middling, as well; bump absorption isn’t as good as, say, a Tucson or Sportage. The 19-inch wheels that come standard on SL and Platinum models likely make the ride a bit stiffer than the 17- or 18-inch wheels found on the Rogue’s lower trim levels.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Compact SUV Challenge: It’s a Repeat Win for the Nissan Rogue\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Nissan Rogue?\n2023 Nissan Rogue Strikes Midnight, Priced From $28,655\nResearch the 2023 Nissan Rogue\nShop for a 2023 Nissan Rogue\nA Decent Value if You Hold the Frills\n\nWith a sticker price of $43,100 (including a $1,295 destination charge), the decked-out, line-topping Platinum model we tested wasn’t a particularly good value. In our comparison test, only the Escape and CX-50 were pricier, and they both had significantly more powerful engines.\n\nHowever, our test Rogue was equipped with a few frivolous options that pumped up the price and hurt the value equation. The Platinum Premium Package is probably worth its $620 price tag, as is the $425 floormat set with first-aid kit, but most shoppers could easily live without the two-tone paint ($350), illuminated kick plates ($400), interior accent lighting ($350), external ground lighting (also known as puddle lamps, $620) and frameless rearview mirror with universal remote ($400). Presto — that knocks $2,120 off right there.\n\nA $40K-ish sticker price might seem like a lot to pay for a compact SUV from Nissan, but several class rivals also cross that threshold in their higher trim levels, and the Rogue Platinum compares well to all of them. The Rogue’s more affordable trims deliver a respectable roster of standard equipment at competitive prices. The Nissan Rogue doesn’t suffer from any major gaffes or compromises, and it does a lot of things well; that’s why it’s a two-time champion in Cars.com’s Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
