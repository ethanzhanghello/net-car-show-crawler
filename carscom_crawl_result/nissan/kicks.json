      "expert_review": "If I’m being honest, the prospect of driving the 2018 Nissan Kicks did not have me jumping for joy. Small SUVs might be my least favorite class of vehicles, partly because I think they’re usually too expensive and lack the practicality that should be requisite to having “utility” as a part of the vehicle’s designation.\n\nRelated: Pumped-Up Kicks? Actually, 2018 Nissan Kicks Price Not Pumped Up at All\n\nThat’s why the Kicks felt like such a breath of fresh air to me. It has the right price, the right amount of cabin and cargo room, and the right amount of styling customization to appeal to a wide range of buyers. (It also has a name that’s ripe for puns, but I will try to resist.)\n\n2018 Nissan Kicks SR | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nNissan curiously refused to call the Kicks an SUV at the drive event, at least in part because it doesn’t offer all-wheel drive (the Kicks is front-wheel drive only) but also because it believes the Kicks can compete with the Hyundai Kona and Kia Soul, which one could argue are more hatchback cars than SUVs. But if you go on Nissan’s website, it’s listed under “crossovers and SUVs,” so who knows. I’ll just say this: The Kicks has enough value, features and usable space to work in either vehicle category. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Kicks isn’t very fun to drive. It shares a platform with the Nissan Versa and Versa Note, two subcompact cars that are better known for being affordable than having any kind of dynamic acumen.\n\nThere is only one powertrain: a 125-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 115 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. Though the Kicks is surprisingly light, with all three trim levels weighing less than 2,700 pounds, the engine still feels pretty sluggish on the road and especially from a stop. And when you do put your foot into it, the engine gets noisy in an unpleasant, droning way.\n\nOne aspect of the driving experience did surprise me pleasantly: The Kicks has some cornering competence. I tested an SR trim level, which comes with a few added dynamic control features including Active Trace Control and Active Ride Control, and it feels better off for them. (ATC uses the stability system and braking to help control trajectory, and ARC uses the throttle and brakes to minimize body pitch when going over certain types of bumps.) It’s no sports car, but the Kicks stays composed in turns and rides confidently with a composure that’s greater than its price tag would suggest.\n\n2018 Nissan Kicks SR | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nAnother thing you’ll notice from the driver’s seat of the Kicks (and from the rest of the seats, for that matter) is great visibility. A tall windshield and giant side windows give good sightlines, especially to the sides where the roofline of the car sat 4 or 5 inches above my eyeline (I’m 5-foot-11). \n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nOverall, roominess is a big plus for the Kicks, which Nissan says has best-in-class front headroom and legroom. Like the Nissan Rogue, the backseat is expansive as well, especially in terms of headroom — there was a good 3 or 4 inches between my head and the headliner, as there is in the front seats, and a few inches of legroom to spare as well. This combines with the high windows to make the Kicks feel a class above in terms of interior size and volume. Behind the seats is 25.3 cubic feet of cargo room, which puts the Kicks near the top of the class alongside the Honda HR-V’s 24.3 cubit feet. For added perspective, the Hyundai Kona has 19.2 cubic feet and the Toyota C-HR 19.0 cubic feet.\n\n2018 Nissan Kicks SR | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nTechnology offerings in the Kicks are good, too. A 7-inch touchscreen comes standard, and the higher SV and SR trim levels feature Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. There are three USB ports, one up front and two in the center console between the front seats far back enough that backseat passengers can easily reach them to charge mobile devices. Nissan also offers a premium Bose audio system as a part of the Premium Package that incorporates a speaker into the driver’s head restraint. This is one of the better budget-friendly sound systems that I’ve heard, and the head restraint speaker is well-executed if you enjoy feeling like the sound is getting pumped right into your head (as I do).\n\nThe interior has a few places where corners get cut, which reminds you of the Kicks’ affordable roots. There are hard plastics on the window sills, and the front passenger doesn’t get an inboard armrest. It’s also missing a feature that I really like: a covered center storage bin. To store valuables safely, you’ll have to go with the glove box. \n\nThen again, the Kicks makes up for the cut corners in a few weird ways. It has a padded center console, something usually found only in premium or luxury cars, and the artificial leather is so convincing that it initially tricked me when I first saw it. \n\nValue, Value, Value\n\nThe Kicks starts at $18,965 for S models (all prices cited include destination charges), with the SV starting at $20,665 and the top-of-the-line SR finishing things off at $21,265. For some perspective, that means the most expensive Kicks SR starts at just $40 more than the cheapest version of the Nissan Juke SUV crossover, discontinued after the 2017 model year, and $1,350 less than the starting price of the 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport, Nissan’s other subcompact, undeniable SUV model (coupled with optional all-wheel drive). And for that money, the Kicks represents an insane value proposition given its feature set, utility and fuel economy. \n\nLooking at the Kicks’ safety features provides a good illustration of this. Forward automatic emergency braking comes standard, and the SV trim adds blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. The SR adds a 360-degree camera system on top of that, which is a ton of content for that sticker price.\n\nOn top of that, Nissan also says the Kicks has best-in-class fuel economy (excluding hybrids) at an EPA-estimated 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined on regular gasoline. Unless you consider its class as widely as all hatchbacks, including lower-riding cars, Nissan appears to be correct. \n\nKicks or Punt?\n\nI came away from my day with the Kicks pretty enamored with it, something I rarely say about vehicles that aren’t very fun to drive. The more I think about it, the more I come to really appreciate the things that it does well. Though I’ll miss the Juke, which was one of the most fun vehicles to drive in this segment, it wasn’t a very good utility vehicle — and the Kicks is a great one.\n\n2018 Nissan Kicks SR | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nNissan stated that the Kicks is aimed at a “multicultural audience between the ages of 25 and 35,” which is … hey, that’s me! But I think that might be a bit limiting. I found the Kicks to be good enough that it works in a wide variety of situations and environments. It’s small enough to be great in the city, has enough passenger and cargo room (and safety features) to be suitable for small families and is priced low enough to be in range for younger drivers, as well.\n\nThe lack of all-wheel drive is a big omission for that will understandably turn off some shoppers. But if you don’t need all-wheel drive, the Kicks is worthy of your attention and a great addition to a Nissan lineup that was in need of a kickstart. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Nissan Kicks?\n\nThe Nissan Kicks is a subcompact SUV that’s less SUV-like than most of its class rivals. Unlike the typical SUV, it’s available only with front-wheel drive, and its styling is a tad more carlike than other subcompact SUVs. Powered by a 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission, the Kicks competes with models like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V and Hyundai Venue.  \n\nThe Kicks has 16.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. See how it scored in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Nissan Kicks?\n\nSV and SR trim levels add access to NissanConnect Services as standard, which enables remote locking and starting, among other features. The 2024 model year is the last for the current-generation Kicks — an all-new, reimagined Kicks (that offers all-wheel drive in addition to FWD) is set to debut as a 2025 model.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Nissan Kicks Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nCloth upholstery\n60/40-split, folding rear seats\n16-inch wheels\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nThree USB ports\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nLED headlights\nBlack 17-inch alloy wheels\nSilver- or black-painted roof rails\nRoof spoiler\nRemote start\nAutomatic air conditioning\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nImitation leather seats\n8-inch touchscreen\nWi-Fi hot spot\nBose premium stereo with driver headrest speakers\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2024 Nissan Kicks?\n\nMore tall hatchback than SUV, the Kicks is easy to drive and great at fitting into snug parking spots. Gas mileage is also impressive, and the Kicks’ standard convenience and safety features may be incentive enough for some shoppers to overlook its mediocre power and lack of AWD. Upscale available features like Bose audio head restraints, a heated steering wheel and adaptive cruise control raise the Kicks’ luxury quotient if you’re willing to pay a bit more.",

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Kicks didn’t make our list of the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy for 2022, but its price tag wasn’t to blame for its absence. Instead, it was the lack of available all-wheel drive that disqualified it from an official SUV designation. Otherwise, the Kicks’ starting price ranks high on the affordability list, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious shoppers. On sale now, the 2023 Kicks sees a $300 price bump over the outgoing base model and starts at $21,585 (all prices include destination charge). Still, the Kicks’ starting price is less than half of the average new car price estimated at $46,259 last month, according to J.D. Power.\n\nRelated: Affordable Wheels: 2022 Nissan Kicks Serves Up MPGs, Space and Tech for $24,440\n\nDespite its small footprint and below-average price, the Kicks offers a surprisingly spacious interior that fits up to five occupants. It also gets impressive fuel economy and a healthy roster of standard safety tech. See what the base S model offers and how its price stacks up against higher trims and its small SUV and fellow pseudo-SUV (no available AWD) rivals.\n\nA Fuel-Efficient Powertrain\n2022 Nissan Kicks | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe Kicks’ sole engine option, a 122-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder, carries over unchanged and is once again paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. In our testing of the 2022 model, we found the SUV was competent on city streets, but it struggled with acceleration on the highway. What the Kicks lacks in passing aptitude, it makes up for in efficiency, with an EPA-rated 31/36/33 mpg and an even higher real-world mpg seen during our testing: a pump-calculated 37 mpg.\n\nBasic Standard Tech, Robust Safety Suite\n2022 Nissan Kicks | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe modest list of standard tech features in the Kicks S includes a 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, three USB ports, a six-speaker audio system and push-button start. The SUV’s suite of standard driver-assist and safety features elevate its value, however. Nissan Safety Shield 360 comes with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, reverse automatic braking and automatic high-beam assist. The S also comes with standard cruise control, but Nissan’s adaptive cruise control system can only be had on higher trims.\n\nShould You Upgrade to the SV or SR?\n2021 Nissan Kicks SR | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe base S comes with standard cloth seats and rides on 16-inch wheels wrapped in all-season tires. The SV model starts at $23,445 and gets larger 17-inch alloy wheels, silver roof rails and an 8-inch touchscreen in place of the 7-inch unit in the base model; it also adds remote start.\n\nStarting at $24,145, the range-topping SR offers unique exterior elements including black roof rails and mirrors, a dark chrome grille, and LED headlights and foglights. Interior appointments include unique seat fabric, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a 360-degree camera. A Bose eight-speaker sound system, faux-leather upholstery, and heated front seats and steering wheel can be added to the SR via an available Premium Package.\n\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe Nissan Kicks competes with a host of small SUVs and pseudo-SUVs including the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Venue, Kia Soul and Toyota Corolla Cross. The Kicks offers a competitive starting price among rivals: The 2022 Trax starts at $22,895, the 2022 Venue at $20,295, the redesigned 2023 HR-V at $24,895, the 2023 Soul at $21,085, and the 2022 Corolla Cross has a starting price of $23,780.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Nissan Kicks Review: Same Value, More Friendly\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Nissan Kicks?\n2021 Nissan Kicks: 7 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nWhat’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\nResearch the Nissan Kicks\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Juke was famous for its funky styling and for the fact that it was one of the few small SUVs that was actually pretty fun to drive. However, the Juke was expensive and not very practical, not to mention far from a best-seller. So when Nissan went back to the drawing board to come up with a replacement, it went in a very different direction.\n\nWhile the new 2018 Nissan Kicks may lack the fun-to-drive nature of the Juke, it’s better in every other way. It has a roomy interior, lots of technology for this class and great value. And if you want funky styling, it’s still available in a few different two-tone paint jobs that make it stand out on the road.\n\nIs It an SUV?\n\nWe would argue that the Kicks isn’t an SUV for one key reason: It comes only with front-wheel drive. The option of all-wheel drive is a strange omission and one that will be felt by those in snowy states. Perhaps Nissan thinks that customers who really want AWD in a small SUV can turn to the more expensive Rogue Sport (see them side by side), but between the Rogue Sport and the Kicks, I’d much rather have a Kicks.\n\nThe Kicks arguably competes both with subcompact SUVs like the Honda HR-V and Hyundai Kona as well as with other FWD-only pseudo-SUVs like the Toyota C-HR. Compare the Kicks with those vehicles here.\n\nApart from its lack of AWD, the Kicks’ other measurables stack up nicely against these competitors. It has the most rear cargo room (25.3 cubic feet), the most front and rear headroom, and the lowest base price by a healthy margin ($18,895; all prices cited include destination charges). That emphasis on value is really what sets the Kicks apart.\n\nValue, Value, Value\n\nThis is going to sound like hyperbole, but the Kicks might present the best value in the automotive market today — especially its higher trim levels. The Kicks is sold in three trim levels: S, SV ($20,685) and SR ($21,285). The SR is offered along with a Premium Package that tacks on another $1,000, but that’s it.\n\nAll models come with a standard 7-inch touchscreen display, three USB ports, automatic forward emergency braking and keyless entry. The SV adds blind spot warnings, automatic climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, remote start and satellite radio. On top of that, the SR adds some exterior parts including a rear spoiler and LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nSlap on the Premium Package as my test vehicle did, which adds a Bose personal audio system with speakers in the head restraint, faux-leather upholstery and heated front seats, and that’s a formidable list of equipment for right around $23,025 (including $545 for two-tone paint and $215 for floormats). None of the Kicks’ competitors can match it, though some do offer more safety features (notably adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist). That 360-degree camera system, a class-exclusive feature to the Kicks, is a great help for parallel parking and other tight spaces. Like other high-riding vehicles, it’s kind of hard to see shorter objects in the immediate vicinity, and the camera alleviates many of those worries.\n\nInterior Space and Quality\n\nThe Kicks also excels at using its interior space efficiently. It’s not a large vehicle, but you could be excused for thinking it is when you get inside. A lot of small SUVs and tall hatchbacks (as we’ll call them) have compromised headroom, but not the Kicks. I found a solid 3- or 4-inch gap between my head and the headliner in both the front and rear seats. Visibility is also a strength, as those tall side windows offer good views out from any seat, which backseat passengers especially will appreciate.\n\nThere are a few places where the Kicks interior quality does dip, however, reminding you of its budget-friendly nature. The window sills are hard plastic instead of a softer material, and the front passenger is missing an inboard armrest. There’s also an uncovered center storage console — valuables will have to go in the glove box to be hidden.\n\nThe three USB ports are well spread throughout the cabin; there is one up front in front of the gear selector, and the other two sit between the two front seats where they can be reached by anyone in the cabin. I was also a fan of the Kicks’ touchscreen placement; I could reach it from the driver’s seat easily, but it was still high enough to see without looking down too much. I came to appreciate how well thought out the Kicks interior is — a small vehicle with an interior that feels large is no easy feat.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the hood is a modest 125-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder that is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The driving experience in the Kicks is the most average thing about it: This is not a fast vehicle, and 125 hp doesn’t provide enough go-go for fun behind the wheel. And like most CVTs, the Kicks is a little sluggish from a stop, but after you get going, the power comes on with more impetus. The handling, meanwhile, grades out a little better. I thought the rear end would be a mess, but it’s actually quite composed, and the Kicks rides decently over broken pavement without punishing its occupants. The steering is lightly weighted, but it tracks well on the highway.\n\nThere is one part of driving the Kicks that stands out: visibility. Those big windows give the driver clear sightlines out of all sides, including the rear window that looms large in the rearview mirror. I worried about those wide C-pillars, but the windows on the rear doors stretch way back so you have a good view of your blind spot on both flanks.\n\nFuel-economy ratings also give the Kicks an edge — an EPA-estimated 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined. None of the FWD versions of competitors mentioned earlier top 30 mpg combined.\n\nSummertime Kicks\n\nThe Kicks not offering all-wheel drive is a bummer because that can be a deal breaker for many car shoppers, including those who live where weather is a factor — especially since there are close competitors to the Kicks that do offer it, including the Rogue Sport out of Nissan’s own stable. But for me? I live in Los Angeles, where we pay absurd rents and fight through outrageous traffic on a regular basis for the privilege of year-round sun. Here, the Kicks not offering AWD isn’t to its detriment, and its small-footprint, big-utility combo makes it even more appealing in the cramped parking spaces of the city.\n\nIf you don’t need four driven wheels, the Kicks is an outstanding entrant in this class. It offers a combination of value and interior space I haven’t found in other models along with superior fuel efficiency. The Kicks might not be quite as fun or quirky as the Juke was, but it is the superior vehicle — and worth much consideration for utility shoppers.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Nissan Juke was famous for its funky styling and for the fact that it was one of the few small SUVs that was actually pretty fun to drive. However, the Juke was expensive and not very practical, not to mention far from a best-seller. So when Nissan went back to the drawing board to come up with a replacement, it went in a very different direction.\n\nWhile the new 2018 Nissan Kicks may lack the fun-to-drive nature of the Juke, it’s better in every other way. It has a roomy interior, lots of technology for this class and great value. And if you want funky styling, it’s still available in a few different two-tone paint jobs that make it stand out on the road.\n\nIs It an SUV?\n\nWe would argue that the Kicks isn’t an SUV for one key reason: It comes only with front-wheel drive. The option of all-wheel drive is a strange omission and one that will be felt by those in snowy states. Perhaps Nissan thinks that customers who really want AWD in a small SUV can turn to the more expensive Rogue Sport (see them side by side), but between the Rogue Sport and the Kicks, I’d much rather have a Kicks.\n\nThe Kicks arguably competes both with subcompact SUVs like the Honda HR-V and Hyundai Kona as well as with other FWD-only pseudo-SUVs like the Toyota C-HR. Compare the Kicks with those vehicles here.\n\nApart from its lack of AWD, the Kicks’ other measurables stack up nicely against these competitors. It has the most rear cargo room (25.3 cubic feet), the most front and rear headroom, and the lowest base price by a healthy margin ($18,895; all prices cited include destination charges). That emphasis on value is really what sets the Kicks apart.\n\nValue, Value, Value\n\nThis is going to sound like hyperbole, but the Kicks might present the best value in the automotive market today — especially its higher trim levels. The Kicks is sold in three trim levels: S, SV ($20,685) and SR ($21,285). The SR is offered along with a Premium Package that tacks on another $1,000, but that’s it.\n\nAll models come with a standard 7-inch touchscreen display, three USB ports, automatic forward emergency braking and keyless entry. The SV adds blind spot warnings, automatic climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, remote start and satellite radio. On top of that, the SR adds some exterior parts including a rear spoiler and LED headlights, a 360-degree camera system and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nSlap on the Premium Package as my test vehicle did, which adds a Bose personal audio system with speakers in the head restraint, faux-leather upholstery and heated front seats, and that’s a formidable list of equipment for right around $23,025 (including $545 for two-tone paint and $215 for floormats). None of the Kicks’ competitors can match it, though some do offer more safety features (notably adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist). That 360-degree camera system, a class-exclusive feature to the Kicks, is a great help for parallel parking and other tight spaces. Like other high-riding vehicles, it’s kind of hard to see shorter objects in the immediate vicinity, and the camera alleviates many of those worries.\n\nInterior Space and Quality\n\nThe Kicks also excels at using its interior space efficiently. It’s not a large vehicle, but you could be excused for thinking it is when you get inside. A lot of small SUVs and tall hatchbacks (as we’ll call them) have compromised headroom, but not the Kicks. I found a solid 3- or 4-inch gap between my head and the headliner in both the front and rear seats. Visibility is also a strength, as those tall side windows offer good views out from any seat, which backseat passengers especially will appreciate.\n\nThere are a few places where the Kicks interior quality does dip, however, reminding you of its budget-friendly nature. The window sills are hard plastic instead of a softer material, and the front passenger is missing an inboard armrest. There’s also an uncovered center storage console — valuables will have to go in the glove box to be hidden.\n\nThe three USB ports are well spread throughout the cabin; there is one up front in front of the gear selector, and the other two sit between the two front seats where they can be reached by anyone in the cabin. I was also a fan of the Kicks’ touchscreen placement; I could reach it from the driver’s seat easily, but it was still high enough to see without looking down too much. I came to appreciate how well thought out the Kicks interior is — a small vehicle with an interior that feels large is no easy feat.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the hood is a modest 125-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder that is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The driving experience in the Kicks is the most average thing about it: This is not a fast vehicle, and 125 hp doesn’t provide enough go-go for fun behind the wheel. And like most CVTs, the Kicks is a little sluggish from a stop, but after you get going, the power comes on with more impetus. The handling, meanwhile, grades out a little better. I thought the rear end would be a mess, but it’s actually quite composed, and the Kicks rides decently over broken pavement without punishing its occupants. The steering is lightly weighted, but it tracks well on the highway.\n\nThere is one part of driving the Kicks that stands out: visibility. Those big windows give the driver clear sightlines out of all sides, including the rear window that looms large in the rearview mirror. I worried about those wide C-pillars, but the windows on the rear doors stretch way back so you have a good view of your blind spot on both flanks.\n\nFuel-economy ratings also give the Kicks an edge — an EPA-estimated 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined. None of the FWD versions of competitors mentioned earlier top 30 mpg combined.\n\nSummertime Kicks\n\nThe Kicks not offering all-wheel drive is a bummer because that can be a deal breaker for many car shoppers, including those who live where weather is a factor — especially since there are close competitors to the Kicks that do offer it, including the Rogue Sport out of Nissan’s own stable. But for me? I live in Los Angeles, where we pay absurd rents and fight through outrageous traffic on a regular basis for the privilege of year-round sun. Here, the Kicks not offering AWD isn’t to its detriment, and its small-footprint, big-utility combo makes it even more appealing in the cramped parking spaces of the city.\n\nIf you don’t need four driven wheels, the Kicks is an outstanding entrant in this class. It offers a combination of value and interior space I haven’t found in other models along with superior fuel efficiency. The Kicks might not be quite as fun or quirky as the Juke was, but it is the superior vehicle — and worth much consideration for utility shoppers.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Still cheap, still cheerful, the 2021 Nissan Kicks keeps its tech current while adding some customizable flair.\n\nVersus the competition: With its solid combination of safety equipment, multimedia tech, versatile interior space and value pricing, the Kicks holds its own against competitors like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Soul and other front-wheel-drive-only tiny SUVs. That lack of all-wheel drive keeps it from being fully competitive against models like the Ford EcoSport, Hyundai Kona and Honda HR-V.\n\nThe cheap and cheerful end of the SUV showroom is getting a lot of attention from automakers as buyers continue to eschew subcompact hatchbacks and sedans in favor of the slightly larger, slightly taller SUV-style models. Tall crossovers like the Nissan Kicks, Hyundai Venue and Honda HR-V are replacing the Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent and Honda Fit in the eyes of consumers as the more desirable entry-level models. They’re more expensive than their sedan counterparts, but that hasn’t stopped buyers from making them their choice. In order to keep the Nissan Kicks competitive in the wake of a growing field of competitors, the brand has released a slightly refreshed version for 2021 with some subtle changes inside and out that it hopes will keep the diminutive runabout fresh. \n\nRelated: 2021 Nissan Kicks: Subtle but Welcome Improvements\n\nLooks a Little Sharper\n\nNissan has done a good job updating the look of the Kicks to more closely fit in with the rest of the redone Nissan showroom, all of which is getting a redo as part of the global Nissan Next product update plan. There’s a new grille, headlights, foglights, bumper and trim up front, and revised taillights and trim out back. The look is a very slight change, but it does modernize the Kicks a bit more, and it helps to draw the eye to a wider look even though the car’s track measurements haven’t changed at all. There are also some new wheels available, which are themselves customizable.\n\nNissan is introducing a new program that will allow Kicks buyers to personalize their rides through the Kicks Color Studio, which will offer more than a dozen colored elements — including wheel caps and inserts, mirrors, interior vents and more — that can be mixed and matched in ways to suit the buyer’s tastes. We haven’t yet seen what might be accomplished through use of the Color Studio, but the car itself does benefit from all of the styling changes that have been made. It sports the now-ubiquitous, optional, two-tone floating roof treatment that nearly all SUVs seem to have adopted, but its edgy styling does differentiate it from more generic boxes like the Hyundai Venue and Ford EcoSport. The difference between the 2020 and 2021 model Kicks is subtle, and you’d likely have to park one next to the other to spot the changes, but the new aesthetic is more attractive than the outgoing one. \n\nHope You Aren’t in a Hurry\n\nPowering the Kicks is a dinky 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine making 122 horsepower and 114 pounds-feet of torque. If that doesn’t sound like a whole lot of grunt, that’s because it’s not. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission that actually does a decent job of keeping the engine in its limited power band, giving the Kicks the descriptor of “adequately powered, but only just.” Let’s put it this way: In a stoplight drag race between a new Kicks and new 121-hp Hyundai Venue, neither would win. If you want more power, you’ll have to look to a Kia Soul, Honda HR-V or a turbocharged Jeep Renegade. But the lack of any sort of sportiness or alacrity to the drivetrain is OK, as the steering and handling aren’t tuned for entertainment purposes, either. The Kicks rides quite nicely, absorbing bumps and road imperfections with impressive damping, but it’s also a bit floaty, leaning more than you might expect in corners or on highway on-ramps. The steering is highly boosted and not blessed with a quick ratio, but again, this isn’t a ding against the Kicks, as the SUV is basically designed to do one thing well: be cheap, reliable, useful urban transportation. \n\nThe benefit of seemingly being powered by a band of lethargic gerbils is fuel economy that tops the list of competitors: 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined, unchanged from the 2020 model year. You won’t achieve those levels if you drive it with a heavy foot, but if you’re using the Kicks as it’s intended to be used, these numbers should be achievable. Part of the reason they’re achievable is that the Kicks is available only with front-wheel drive, similar to vehicles like the Hyundai Venue and Kia Soul, and unlike the Honda HR-V, Ford EcoSport and Jeep Renegade that offer optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThis really is intended as a city car, one you’d buy if you have limited parking space, fight narrow streets filled with delivery trucks all the time, or need a basic conveyance to get you and friends or cargo around town easily. In that role, the Kicks excels — lower-speed stop-and-go traffic is where it truly feels most at home, with excellent outward visibility, surprisingly good sound insulation and an upright, high-sitting driving position that makes you feel like you’re piloting something other than a dinky little subcompact SUV. It’s not that the Kicks can’t handle the highway — it does so rather well, with a surprising amount of steady high-speed calmness for such a small vehicle. It’s just that the compact dimensions, clever packaging and ease of use lends itself to tighter urban environments instead of America’s wide interstates. \n\nNew Tech, Nicer Inside\n\nThe interior gets a little love from Nissan in this refresh, as well, but just like the outside, changes are minimal and designed to further improve the experience, not dramatically change it. First and foremost is the new optional 8-inch touchscreen; a 7-inch screen (2020’s only offering) is still standard. The new 8-inch model feels big in this compact interior, and all versions now feature standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, another thing that used to be optional. The rest of the interior looks largely the same, with Nissan insisting there are new materials, new vents, new trim and new covering material for the dash and doors. A new center console armrest replaces the previous driver-seat-mounted armrest, but it’s still too small and too low to be of any use for actually resting your arm.\n\nThe interior isn’t overly spacious, but it doesn’t feel cramped. The seats sit high but are oddly firm and not terribly comfortable for longer missions. Backseat room is adequate, with decent room for two to sit without their knees pressed against the front seatbacks. It doesn’t feel like it has the bountiful legroom of a Nissan Versa or Sentra, but it’ll do for getting friends to dinner across town or younger kids to soccer practice. The cargo area is surprisingly large, with a deep well and a surprising reach from the liftgate to the rear seatbacks that make for more room back there for luggage or boxes than you might expect to find. Of course, those seatbacks fold to increase the cargo area, but they don’t fold flat; they remain raised above the level of the cargo floor, so the surface isn’t totally flat for larger items. \n\nThe cabin is competitive with others in the class thanks to the updated multimedia system, the option of up to four USB ports (two type A, two type C), and its acceptable level of space and utility. The Honda HR-V still feels like it has a more cavernous cargo area, especially with its trick folding backseat stowed, and the Hyundai Venue’s interior feels a bit more upscale, with a multimedia system that simply seems better designed and a level of standard safety systems that hasn’t yet been beaten. But the Kicks feels like an easily viable alternative to any of them, with its subtle improvements keeping it in the hunt for those first-time buyers seeking something new and relatively affordable with all the latest tech, a solid level of standard safety equipment and a value equation that definitely works in its favor. It’s a decidedly competitive entry to the burgeoning field of entry-level vehicles and should be on anyone’s consideration list when shopping for one.\n\nFull pricing for the 2021 Kicks was not yet available at the time of publication, but overall pricing is not expected to be appreciably different from the outgoing 2020 model given its starting price of $20,595 (including destination), a modest $430 increase.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Still cheap, still cheerful, the 2021 Nissan Kicks keeps its tech current while adding some customizable flair.\n\nVersus the competition: With its solid combination of safety equipment, multimedia tech, versatile interior space and value pricing, the Kicks holds its own against competitors like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Soul and other front-wheel-drive-only tiny SUVs. That lack of all-wheel drive keeps it from being fully competitive against models like the Ford EcoSport, Hyundai Kona and Honda HR-V.\n\nThe cheap and cheerful end of the SUV showroom is getting a lot of attention from automakers as buyers continue to eschew subcompact hatchbacks and sedans in favor of the slightly larger, slightly taller SUV-style models. Tall crossovers like the Nissan Kicks, Hyundai Venue and Honda HR-V are replacing the Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent and Honda Fit in the eyes of consumers as the more desirable entry-level models. They’re more expensive than their sedan counterparts, but that hasn’t stopped buyers from making them their choice. In order to keep the Nissan Kicks competitive in the wake of a growing field of competitors, the brand has released a slightly refreshed version for 2021 with some subtle changes inside and out that it hopes will keep the diminutive runabout fresh. \n\nRelated: 2021 Nissan Kicks: Subtle but Welcome Improvements\n\nLooks a Little Sharper\n\nNissan has done a good job updating the look of the Kicks to more closely fit in with the rest of the redone Nissan showroom, all of which is getting a redo as part of the global Nissan Next product update plan. There’s a new grille, headlights, foglights, bumper and trim up front, and revised taillights and trim out back. The look is a very slight change, but it does modernize the Kicks a bit more, and it helps to draw the eye to a wider look even though the car’s track measurements haven’t changed at all. There are also some new wheels available, which are themselves customizable.\n\nNissan is introducing a new program that will allow Kicks buyers to personalize their rides through the Kicks Color Studio, which will offer more than a dozen colored elements — including wheel caps and inserts, mirrors, interior vents and more — that can be mixed and matched in ways to suit the buyer’s tastes. We haven’t yet seen what might be accomplished through use of the Color Studio, but the car itself does benefit from all of the styling changes that have been made. It sports the now-ubiquitous, optional, two-tone floating roof treatment that nearly all SUVs seem to have adopted, but its edgy styling does differentiate it from more generic boxes like the Hyundai Venue and Ford EcoSport. The difference between the 2020 and 2021 model Kicks is subtle, and you’d likely have to park one next to the other to spot the changes, but the new aesthetic is more attractive than the outgoing one. \n\nHope You Aren’t in a Hurry\n\nPowering the Kicks is a dinky 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine making 122 horsepower and 114 pounds-feet of torque. If that doesn’t sound like a whole lot of grunt, that’s because it’s not. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission that actually does a decent job of keeping the engine in its limited power band, giving the Kicks the descriptor of “adequately powered, but only just.” Let’s put it this way: In a stoplight drag race between a new Kicks and new 121-hp Hyundai Venue, neither would win. If you want more power, you’ll have to look to a Kia Soul, Honda HR-V or a turbocharged Jeep Renegade. But the lack of any sort of sportiness or alacrity to the drivetrain is OK, as the steering and handling aren’t tuned for entertainment purposes, either. The Kicks rides quite nicely, absorbing bumps and road imperfections with impressive damping, but it’s also a bit floaty, leaning more than you might expect in corners or on highway on-ramps. The steering is highly boosted and not blessed with a quick ratio, but again, this isn’t a ding against the Kicks, as the SUV is basically designed to do one thing well: be cheap, reliable, useful urban transportation. \n\nThe benefit of seemingly being powered by a band of lethargic gerbils is fuel economy that tops the list of competitors: 31/36/33 mpg city/highway/combined, unchanged from the 2020 model year. You won’t achieve those levels if you drive it with a heavy foot, but if you’re using the Kicks as it’s intended to be used, these numbers should be achievable. Part of the reason they’re achievable is that the Kicks is available only with front-wheel drive, similar to vehicles like the Hyundai Venue and Kia Soul, and unlike the Honda HR-V, Ford EcoSport and Jeep Renegade that offer optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThis really is intended as a city car, one you’d buy if you have limited parking space, fight narrow streets filled with delivery trucks all the time, or need a basic conveyance to get you and friends or cargo around town easily. In that role, the Kicks excels — lower-speed stop-and-go traffic is where it truly feels most at home, with excellent outward visibility, surprisingly good sound insulation and an upright, high-sitting driving position that makes you feel like you’re piloting something other than a dinky little subcompact SUV. It’s not that the Kicks can’t handle the highway — it does so rather well, with a surprising amount of steady high-speed calmness for such a small vehicle. It’s just that the compact dimensions, clever packaging and ease of use lends itself to tighter urban environments instead of America’s wide interstates. \n\nNew Tech, Nicer Inside\n\nThe interior gets a little love from Nissan in this refresh, as well, but just like the outside, changes are minimal and designed to further improve the experience, not dramatically change it. First and foremost is the new optional 8-inch touchscreen; a 7-inch screen (2020’s only offering) is still standard. The new 8-inch model feels big in this compact interior, and all versions now feature standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, another thing that used to be optional. The rest of the interior looks largely the same, with Nissan insisting there are new materials, new vents, new trim and new covering material for the dash and doors. A new center console armrest replaces the previous driver-seat-mounted armrest, but it’s still too small and too low to be of any use for actually resting your arm.\n\nThe interior isn’t overly spacious, but it doesn’t feel cramped. The seats sit high but are oddly firm and not terribly comfortable for longer missions. Backseat room is adequate, with decent room for two to sit without their knees pressed against the front seatbacks. It doesn’t feel like it has the bountiful legroom of a Nissan Versa or Sentra, but it’ll do for getting friends to dinner across town or younger kids to soccer practice. The cargo area is surprisingly large, with a deep well and a surprising reach from the liftgate to the rear seatbacks that make for more room back there for luggage or boxes than you might expect to find. Of course, those seatbacks fold to increase the cargo area, but they don’t fold flat; they remain raised above the level of the cargo floor, so the surface isn’t totally flat for larger items. \n\nThe cabin is competitive with others in the class thanks to the updated multimedia system, the option of up to four USB ports (two type A, two type C), and its acceptable level of space and utility. The Honda HR-V still feels like it has a more cavernous cargo area, especially with its trick folding backseat stowed, and the Hyundai Venue’s interior feels a bit more upscale, with a multimedia system that simply seems better designed and a level of standard safety systems that hasn’t yet been beaten. But the Kicks feels like an easily viable alternative to any of them, with its subtle improvements keeping it in the hunt for those first-time buyers seeking something new and relatively affordable with all the latest tech, a solid level of standard safety equipment and a value equation that definitely works in its favor. It’s a decidedly competitive entry to the burgeoning field of entry-level vehicles and should be on anyone’s consideration list when shopping for one.\n\nFull pricing for the 2021 Kicks was not yet available at the time of publication, but overall pricing is not expected to be appreciably different from the outgoing 2020 model given its starting price of $20,595 (including destination), a modest $430 increase.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Overview: A Blend of Style, Features and Affordability\n\nThe Nissan Kicks is a subcompact SUV that aims to stand out from the pack by offering style-forward design touches and a fairly broad range of available equipment. The Kicks was completely redesigned for 2025 to kick off its second generation, growing in size over its predecessor and gaining available all-wheel drive as an option to front-wheel drive.\n\nTrim Levels: S, SV and SR Compared\nS: Entry-level offering with Nissan’s Safety Shield 360 suite of safety features standard\nSV: Mid-level trim with wireless phone charging and 17-inch wheels instead of 16s, as well as the availability of more optional equipment\nSR: Top trim featuring synthetic leather upholstery with cloth inserts, 12.3-inch digital gauge display, available 19-inch wheels, an upgraded sound system, and other standard and optional features\nNew for 2026: Infotainment and Cold Weather Package\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto now standard on all trims (was previously only on SV and SR)\nCold Weather Package for SV and SR trims bundles heated seats, heated side mirrors and rear floor heater ducts\nPerformance: 2.0-liter Engine and Optional AWD\n\nThe 2026 Kicks’ sole engine is a 141-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that is paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While adequate for daily driving, acceleration is modest when fully loaded. AWD is available across the board for an additional $1,500-$1,650, trim level depending.\n\nTechnology and Safety: Standard Nissan Safety Shield 360\n\nA generous selection of standard and available safety features is a strong point of the Kicks. The Nissan Safety Shield 360 suite of safety features is standard across the lineup and includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring. The SR comes standard with a 360-degree camera system, lane-centering steering, blind spot intervention and other exclusive safety features.\n\nIs the 2026 Nissan Kicks a Good Budget SUV?\n\nThe 2026 Nissan Kicks boasts fun styling touches inside and out along with an impressive list of available comfort, convenience and tech features. Like most subcompact SUVs, it’s not very quick — especially at highway speeds — and the engine can get noisy during acceleration. Even so, the Kicks’ virtues and affordable pricing make it a compelling option for budget-conscious buyers.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2025 Nissan Kicks proves that cars don’t have to be expensive to be interesting or stylish, as the small SUV offers an array of unconventional stylistic touches and a strong mid-trim feature set that belie both its price and class.\n\nVersus the competition: The 2025 Kicks is larger than before, replacing both the prior generation and previously discontinued Rogue Sport in Nissan’s lineup. It now faces off against models including the Honda HR-V, Kia Soul and Toyota Corolla Cross. While the Kicks’ S trim level doesn’t offer much, the middle SV and uplevel SR trims are attractive and well equipped.\n\nExpensive cars are so hot right now. Ignoring the crashing waves of comparably expensive electric vehicles, it seems most automakers deeply enjoy the apparent margins afforded by pricier vehicles subsidized by America’s alarming tolerance for big debt. Why sell one $20,000 sedan when you can sell 15 $65,000 pickup trucks?\n\nSupply and demand, baby — it’s all an endless cycle. And, with the gradual weaning of the sub-$25,000 vehicle, a demand for affordability grows, leading to a few new bright spots of thrift, including the 2025 Nissan Kicks. The debut of Nissan’s smallest, funkiest and least expensive SUV made big waves at the 2024 New York International Auto Show, and I’ve been keen to drive Nissan’s fresh-squeezed subcompact SUV ever since.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2025 Nissan Kicks Priced From $23,220\n\nLast-Gen Kicks? Kick Me\n\nThat’s a somewhat strange sentiment, as the prior generation of the Kicks is generally regarded as a miserable beacon of personal misfortune. Few folks presumably wanted the last Kicks; it was simply a means to land new, reliable transportation with a warranty and more cargo space than Nissan’s Versa or Sentra sedans. Meanwhile, the larger Rogue Sport was not much better, light on both character and a memorable name.\n\nThe new-gen Kicks solves both problems. Consider it the surprisingly handsome fusion of the prior Kicks and erstwhile Rogue Sport, adding optional all-wheel drive and growing considerably in size over its predecessor to the point that it’s nearly as large as the discontinued Rogue-lette. The family ties are more than skin-deep, too: The new Kicks’ naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is larger than the 1.6-liter mill in its predecessor, an updated variant of the Rogue Sport’s near-identical 2.0-liter heart.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nTrim Tango\n\nOn paper, the basest-of-base Kicks, the S trim, isn’t all that much better equipped than the stripped-out versions of its progenitors, offering only expected modern-era hardware like cloth seats, power windows, automatic headlights and a single USB-A port in the front for $23,220 (all prices include a $1,390 destination fee). The S trim’s sole standout feature appears to be the dual 7-inch displays for both the instrument panel and center infotainment system that are upgraded to 12.3-inch screens in uplevel trims. Crucially, both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t available on the S, as this connectivity is gated behind the next-up SV trim, which starts at $25,070.\n\nI am not for one second casting stones here. Though there are a staggering number of folks for which a 2025 Kicks S would be a blessing, I hazard the S will make up the minority of sales, with the majority spending a (relatively) paltry $1,850 to upgrade to the SV. This adds the 12.3-inch center infotainment touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB-C ports up front and wireless device charging, among other things.\n\nWithout having seen (let alone driven) the new Kicks SV in person, I can’t say much more about it other than my suspicions that it’s the one to get if you’re budget-minded. All of my time at Nissan’s first-drive event for the Kicks was spent in and around the line-topping SR, which starts at $27,570 and is loaded with additional toys like USB-C charge ports for the rear passengers, simulated leather seat trim, a matching 12.3-inch driver display and automatic climate control. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nSeriously Stylish\n\nBefore we get movin’, take a look at just how visually distinct it is. Even without the SR’s adornment, it’s a handsome crossover with more than a hint of the Nissan Z sports car in its visual attitude and a dollop of Volvo XC40 in its rear haunches. Equipped with the blocky, straked 17-inch wheels and contrast-color roof in either black, gray or the red you see in our photos, the Kicks’ traffic presence is undeniable; a quick stopover for coffee in my red-roofed test car had a middle-aged passersby leering at me and giving a surprising thumbs up.\n\nBold style seems to be the way forward in the arena of affordability. Whether it’s to free the car from visual markers of “entry level,” low-priced SUVs (and one trucklet) like the Kicks, Chevrolet Trax, Kia Soul and Ford Maverick put points in style with balanced substance, giving these “cheap” cars broader appeal.\n\nOn the road, the Kicks is a perfectly serviceable and reasonably refined small SUV that should serve you well beyond 100,000 miles; sip gas; and haul friends, family and cargo when needed.\n\nPredictable Dynamics\n\nIt drives exactly as you might expect — and that’s a great thing! Steering is light and artificial with a smidge of weightiness, and braking feel is as confident and well balanced as any regular Nissan product. The ride quality is tidy and perfectly serviceable for the price and class, with well-controlled body motions and good bump isolation. Nissan says the new Kicks has increased sound-deadening material, and it sounds like it during low-speed urban navigation.\n\nIt’s only when merging or making aggressive maneuvers where the sole bit of cheapness emerges. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder is good for 141 horsepower and 140 pounds-feet of torque, and it pairs with Nissan’s familiar continuously variable automatic transmission that holds revs high and loud, resulting in a harsh, thrash-‘n’-gnash tone that echoes throughout the cabin — unpleasant, but a characteristic endemic from top to bottom in the class.\n\nPower is adequate, with any wish for merging speed beyond the 65 mph mark taking a notably long time. That’s all right; for the overwhelming majority of Kicks owners, it’s enough. But those wishing to load it up with cargo or people will need to plan their passing moves.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nNissan Maintenance Care Program Includes Free Oil Changes for New Cars\n2025 Nissan Kicks Up Close: Maturing, But Not Too Much\n2025 Nissan Kicks Gets Larger, More Powerful\n2024 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\nShop for a 2025 Nissan Kicks\nEveryday Hero\n\nAt normal speeds around town, however, it’s a great little runabout for hopping between the cafe, work, school and home. The SR is particularly suited for this, with fun accouterment like optional embedded Bose speakers in the front head restraints that lend a distinctly spatial sound to your best playlist. And when you’re not driving like an annoyingly aggressive automotive writer (like myself), the engine’s gnarly gnash settles nicely into the background, damped by cosseting auto-hold capability, rich displays and bright, cheeky red accents scattered throughout the cabin.\n\nI like it. Affordability-focused shoppers shouldn’t have to choose between substance and style, or be punished for selecting one over the other. The 2025 Nissan Kicks is a heartening bit of cheer in a world that seems more expensive by the day, and a slash of color in a sea of silver and gray. Please get the red roof and the blocky wheels — why be boring?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
