      "expert_review": "We recently brought you a review of the new 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire, the upstart electric automaker’s supercar-killing flagship luxury performance sedan. With a quarter-million-dollar sticker price and performance numbers closer to an F-22 Raptor fighter jet than a passenger sedan, it’s accurate to say the exotic experience the Air Sapphire provides is one only a handful of people will ever experience. But we wondered what life was like at the other end of the Lucid showroom: How does the entry-level $70,000 Lucid Air Pure compare with the eyeball-flattening Sapphire?\n\nThere’s only one way to find out, so we drove a Pure model for a week to see if life is just as good in the base Air. \n\nRelated: 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire Review: Prepare to Swear\n\nOne-Third the Power\n\nThe 2025 Lucid Air lineup consists of the Pure, Touring, Grand Touring and Sapphire. The biggest differences between the lower trim levels are their powertrains and batteries. The Pure and Touring are fairly similar in terms of options and equipment; the Pure uses a single 430-horsepower motor that drives the rear wheels, while the Touring has a motor both up front and in back, good for all-wheel drive and a total output of 620 hp. Step up to the Grand Touring and you get 819 hp from two motors. After that, it’s a pretty big jump to the Sapphire, which uses three motors (two in back, one up front) for 1,234 hp total. Batteries differ, as well, with the Pure using a Long Range pack that’s good for up to 420 miles of EPA-estimated range. The Touring is rated for 406 miles of driving range due to its extra weight and two motors. The Grand Touring and Sapphire use a larger Extended Range pack good for up to 512 and 427 miles of range, respectively. \n\nMy test car was an Air Pure with only two options: 20-inch wheels and a Stealth appearance package that brings blacked-out trim. The grand total came to $75,150 (including destination fee) — less than a third the price of the Lucid Air Sapphire I tested a month prior. \n\nSo it’s a lot cheaper, but how much different is it to drive and live with?\n\nYou Won’t Miss It Much\n\nThe answer to that question is: not as different as you might imagine. The base Lucid Air is still a fantastic luxury car that’s beautifully trimmed inside, and slick and futuristic outside. It has the same excellent touchscreen interface as the Sapphire, which is one of the best user interfaces yet developed for any touchscreen-only car. It features massive interior space, which you wouldn’t expect given its long, low and wide dimensions. The Pure isn’t quite as opulent as some other versions of the Air, and its interior (but not exterior) color palette and materials choices are more limited. But it’s comfortable, silent, damned good looking and just all-around impressive even in its base trim. It still feels like an expensive luxury car. \n\nThe Air Pure’s driving experience differs from the Sapphire only when you really start putting your foot into it, which is a testament to how easy it is to drive the more expensive and powerful Sapphire variant despite its significantly different suspension, brakes, powertrain, tires and tuning. The Air Pure is extremely quick; Lucid says it can complete the 0-60 mph run in 4.5 seconds, which just a few decades ago would have been supercar territory. It doesn’t have the immediate, mind-bending, vision-blurring speed of the Air Sapphire, which can get from 0-60 mph in a claimed 1.89 seconds, but it’s certainly no slouch. What the Pure doesn’t have is the sharpness of the Sapphire; it’s much more a luxury touring sedan than a true track weapon. From its tires to its braking feel, it’s a lot softer than the Sapphire in just about all conditions.\n\nBut that simply means it’s more comfortable. Accelerator response is still excellent, accompanied by no noise whatsoever. Steering is less communicative and not as sharp, even in sport mode, making its responses a bit less quick and twisty roads a little less entertaining. Both the Pure and Sapphire ride beautifully, and that’s a true testament to the tuning that’s gone into both models’ adaptive damper suspensions. Both of them have smooth, quiet, beautifully damped ride quality around town — then, with the touch of a couple of “buttons” on the center screen, can become razor-sharp track monsters that still have impressively smooth ride quality. \n\nThe biggest difference between the performance of the two trim levels might be their braking. The Sapphire has monstrous 10-piston front, four-piston rear calipers gripping huge carbon-ceramic rotors, while the less extreme Air Pure has still-beefy six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers, but no high-performance brake pads and smaller rotors front and rear. The Pure’s brake system still hauls the car down to a stop with ease, but without the firm feel and extraordinary confidence the Sapphire’s system provides.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Lucid Air Grand Touring Gets Efficiency Tweaks, Range Remains 516 Miles\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Lucid Air?\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nEvery New Electric Car Starting Price and Range Available Right Now\nA Fraction of the Price\n\nWhat about in terms of content? If the Sapphire is so much more expensive, is it that much nicer, as well, or are you paying all of that extra coin for the Sapphire’s extra abilities over the Pure?\n\nIt’s a little of both. The Pure eschews some of the more unique options available in other trim levels in order to keep costs down. A glass canopy roof that’s available on the Touring and Grand Touring, for instance, cannot be had on the Pure. The Pure comes standard with 19-inch wheels, with 20s optional, while the Touring and Grand Touring make 21-inch wheels available, too. The Sapphire uses staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels, front and rear. The Pure also doesn’t get things like heated wipers or as many interior color options as you can get on the other trims. \n\nThere’s also a long list of things you do get on the Pure that might surprise you: the adaptive suspension, for one, as well as three-zone climate control, 12-way power-adjustable heated front seats, a power trunk lid, adaptive LED lighting and even illuminated door handles. Options include the Stealth appearance package, a comfort and convenience package, 20-inch wheels and tires, and DreamDrive Pro hands-free cruise control. The Pure and Touring are quite similar apart from their motor setups; stepping up to the Touring opens up more options, but sticking with the lesser Pure trim comes with few penalties. You still get an incredibly well-engineered, beautifully executed luxury car that’s quick, loaded with technology and easier to use than anything from a German brand. It’s silent, comfortable, good looking and, at $75,000 and change, isn’t even outrageously priced in today’s environment. \n\nThe 2025 Lucid Air Pure isn’t the rocket ship the Air Sapphire is, but it’s still an eminently satisfying vehicle that will please its owners — and you can take the $175,000 you saved by not getting a Sapphire and buy yourself a few spec Mazda MX-5 Miata racecars to get your thrills.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Lucid has announced updates to its all-electric 2026 Air sedan lineup, including increased range estimates. All Lucid Airs also will gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network with an approved adapter starting July 31.\n\nRelated: 2025 Lucid Air Pure Quick Spin: Life Is Good at the Cheap End of the Lucid Showroom\n\nA North American Charging Standard-Combined Charging System adapter is required and will be priced at $220 (before taxes). Owners can use the Lucid app to initiate charging at a Supercharger to charge at up to 50 kilowatts and gain up to 200 miles of range per hour, according to Lucid.\n\nAdditionally, all Airs now come with a 40-amp mobile charging cable kit that allows for charging at 240 volts to add up to 40 miles of range per hour; the charger also allows for bidirectional vehicle-to-vehicle charging. The 2026 Air also now has a standard air-conditioning compressor to improve interior quietness and cooling capacity, and an over-the-air update will deliver hands-free driving assist and hands-free lane-changing assist to vehicles with the DreamDrive Pro suite of driver-assist tech.\n\nHow Have the 2026 Lucid Air’s Trims Been Updated?\n\nThere are more granular updates to each of the trim levels of the 2026 Lucid Air, too. The base Air Pure trim is now available with 12-way power heated front seats or optional 20-way power heated and ventilated seats with massage, and a new center console display and storage bin are now included in the comfort and convenience package. The Pure will also be exclusively equipped with the DreamDrive Premium driver-assist system, which features a 360-degree camera system and blind spot monitor. The Air Pure gets 430 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque from its single electric motor, rear-wheel-drive powertrain and 84-kilowatt-hour battery, and it can achieve 420 miles of range on a single charge, per Lucid (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available).\n\nThanks to higher density battery cells, the step-up Touring trim’s range increases from an EPA-rated 406 miles for the 2025 model to a manufacturer-estimated 431 miles; it also gains the ability to charge at up to 250 kW. With dual electric motors for all-wheel drive and a 92-kWh battery, the Air Touring sees a large jump in power from the base trim, with a total of 620 hp and 885 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nLastly, the Air Grand Touring now gets standard 20-way power memory front seats with power-adjustable bolsters, heating, ventilation and massage. It has a manufacturer-estimated range of 512 miles on a single charge and delivers a total of 819 horsepower and 885 pounds-feet of torque with standard AWD and a 117-kWh battery pack.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Lucid Air is on sale now. Pricing for the full lineup is as follows (all prices include a $1,500 destination fee):\n\nPure: $71,400\nTouring: $81,400\nGrand Touring: $116,400\nSapphire: $250,500\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nWhat Are the 10 Most Efficient Electric Cars?\nTeslalternatives: What Should You Buy if You’re Tired of Your Tesla?\n2025 Lucid Gravity: Standard Tesla Port, Up to 450 Miles of Range\nResearch the Lucid Air\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It might seem hard to believe, but the Tesla Model S is nearly a decade old now, first delivered as it was in June of 2012. It’s received updates since then, but not a full redesign, and the Model S now looks much like the Model S did then. But in the years since it appeared, the industry has started to catch up, and now if you want an all-electric, full-size luxury sedan, you have a few more options to choose from, including the Mercedes-EQ EQS, the Porsche Taycan or this, the 2022 Lucid Air.\n\nRelated: Long-Range Strike: Lucid Air EV Range Officially EPA-Rated Up to 520 Miles\n\nWhat the Heck Is a Lucid?\n\nThe what, you say? You’ve certainly heard of Tesla, but you might not yet have heard of Lucid. It was founded in 2007 as a company that was meant to manufacture batteries for other automakers but eventually rebranded itself in 2016 and announced that it was going to be an automaker itself. The company built a brand-new factory in Arizona, and delivered its first cars to paying customers in October.\n\nThat car is this: the Air, a totally clean-sheet design for a luxurious, all-electric, incredibly powerful and opulent car. But the stats are simply jaw-dropping. If you’re looking for an all-out performance machine, the Air Dream Edition Performance comes with 1,111 horsepower and 1,025 pounds-feet of torque. If you’d rather go for range, the Air Dream Edition Range can deliver 520 miles of it while dropping the power output to “only” 933 hp. Now, these are the first editions of the Air, the most expensive and they’re already sold out — but soon there will be three other trims coming: the least expensive Pure, with 480 hp and just over 400 miles of range, the Touring that keeps the range and ups the power to 620 hp, and the Grand Touring that does 800 hp and more than 500 miles of range.\n\nThese numbers seem almost unbelievable, but it gets even better. The car uses a 900-volt battery system, by far the most powerful on the market, and if you were to plug it into one of the still-rare 800-volt, 300-kilowatt DC fast chargers that are slowly appearing around the world, you’d be able to add 300 miles of range in just 20 minutes, according to Lucid. Or if you’re charging at home, the Lucid Air can charge at up to 19.2 kW if you have a robust enough Level 2 charger and the circuit to feed it.\n\n2022 Lucid Air | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nHow does it do all this? How does it get amazing range numbers, incredible power numbers and charge as fast as it does? Simply put: This is basically the next-generation electric car that the Tesla Model S should have become by now but hasn’t. The key is efficiency, something that doesn’t get talked about all that much with electric cars. Everyone prefers to focus on battery size or range or recharge times — but if an electric car is engineered for maximum efficiency, all of those things fall into place. That’s what we have here with the Air.\n\nNext-Generation Engineering\n\nConsider that these crazy, massive power numbers come from a dual-motor car that has an extremely sophisticated motor-differential unit with nearly three times the power density of competitors’ powertrains in a package that weighs 167 pounds and could fit in a roll-aboard suitcase. The battery is a conventional lithium-ion unit, but it’s built in such a way that it minimizes weight, dimensions and cooling requirements. Aerodynamics are key to the efficiency of any car, and the Lucid Air’s 0.21 coefficient of drag makes it incredibly slippery. It’s rated by the EPA to be the most efficient large electric sedan you can buy.\n\nBut how is it to drive? What’s it like inside? Is it as good as offerings like the luxurious, tech-laden, Mercedes-EQ EQS? Yes, it is. It might even be better.\n\nSilent Lucidity\n\nPop into the plush driver’s seat, and gaze around at the cabin that Lucid has crafted — a mix of Tesla-style minimalism, Volvo-style materials and Mercedes-level opulence. Yes, most of the controls are handled by the touchscreen, including things like steering-wheel and mirror adjustments, but they’re all easy to find and use, bright and clear, and nothing seems to be buried behind menus or difficult-to-find layers. It feels easily as sophisticated as the latest Hyperscreen technology in the Mercedes EQS, if not quite as dramatically presented, but it is far, far easier to use at first encounter. Simply put, the Air’s interior doesn’t do anything stupid. It’s rich, drum-tight in terms of its construction, beautiful to look at and pleasing to use. That’s the definition of a luxury car, in my opinion.\n\n2022 Lucid Air | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nIt’s also comfortable. There’s a bit of a duck-down that you’ll need to do in order to get into it, front or back, thanks to the swoopy low roofline and super-thick roof rails. You’ll need those thick rails in order to support rollover protection requirements because the roof on the initial models is an uninterrupted glass panel stretching from the base of the windshield to the rear decklid. Admittedly, this stunning glass roof is best enjoyed from the spacious backseat, as the overhead sun visors for driver and passenger break up that continuous sweep, creating an artificial windshield header that isn’t a factor when you’re taking the whole thing in from the rear.\n\nThe backseat is immediately identifiable as superior to the EQS. It feels like it has more headroom, more legroom and doesn’t have you in an unusual seating position in order to accommodate the underfloor battery. Cargo space is also superior given that you have a large trunk out back with a super-low lift-in height and a full 10-cubic-foot frunk, by Lucid’s accounting. You can’t even open the hood on an EQS; no frunk for you. Forward visibility is also superior to that in the Mercedes, which has an abnormally tall dashboard to accommodate the massive 56-inch Hyperscreen. The Air’s dash is low and wide, giving an excellent view forward. All functions are easy to find and operate, and there isn’t anything that made me say, “Now why the heck would they do it that way?”\n\n2022 Lucid Air | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nAll Fury, No Sound\n\nThere’s no “on” switch for the Air; it uses a passcard like some other automakers are starting to do. But once everything is operating and you move out into traffic, you’re struck by the fact that it doesn’t make any silly noises. There’s no artificial spaceship sound, no crescendo on acceleration that simulates a V-12 engine, no weird chimes or sighs or whooshes — it just sounds like muted electric motors. There’s a bit of road noise from the big 21-inch summer tires on the Air Dream Edition P I drove, but nothing unpleasant. Around the streets of Beverly Hills, Calif., the Lucid drew all kinds of stares and thumbs up, which should tell you something about the interest in this thing in a land where G-Wagens are as thick as Ford Escapes are back in my Michigan. Once traffic cleared, I was able to get out onto a few brief stretches of highway, wherein I engaged Sprint mode, unlocking all 1,111 hp (after you confirm your selection). It was then that I realized what warp speed felt like on “Star Trek.”\n\nIf you’re a Trekkie at all, you’ve seen shots of the USS Enterprise engaging warp drive: There’s a flash, the ship “stretches” and then disappears into the distance with a scenery-blurring whoosh. That’s exactly what flooring the accelerator in a Lucid Air Dream Edition P feels like: instant, stunning, explosive speed. You’re doing triple-digit speeds before you can even think about wanting to do triple-digit speeds. “I think I’ll try for 100 mph” means you’re already doing 100 mph, check your speedometer. But all that fury comes with no sound — there’s no blast from any engine, no aural audiotrack to warn you about what you’re doing. It’s just electronic magic and a sense of unbridled, apex-predator velocity out on the highway.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\nElectric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nHow to Find EV Charging Stations\nEV Owners Frustrated by Public Charging, Says J.D. Power Study\nStops Good, Too\n\nIn between bouts of giggling acceleration, the Lucid Air is also an exceptional grand tourer. It feels considerably lighter on its feet than its size would suggest thanks to beautifully tuned steering and copious grip. The standard level of regenerative braking is pretty aggressive, allowing for normal one-pedal driving around city streets at lower speeds. But when you do need to hit the brakes, you’re rewarded with normalcy, unlike the EQS, which has a horribly artificial feel to it. The Air drives much more like a normal car than the EQS and might prove to be a better step into something electric for someone interested in trading in their conventional S-Class than Mercedes’ own EV.\n\nIt does, however, come at a cost. The first model into customers’ hands is the Dream Edition, or what Lucid offered up at launch — basically a fully loaded version with all the bells and whistles. It starts at a lofty $170,000 or so and is already sold out, but less expensive versions with smaller batteries and less power output will start around $80,000 when the plant begins to crank out more examples of a wider variety in 2022.\n\nI’m always skeptical of a startup company’s first cars — they’re rarely well done, frequently fraught with bugs, assembly issues, squeaks and rattles, and odd design choices. The Lucid Air exhibits none of these quirks. If any other automaker had produced this, it would be an award-winning triumph. That it came as the first car from a brand-new startup company is even more astonishing. If its first car is this good, I can’t even imagine how good Lucid’s next one is going to be.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The absolute apex predator of performance cars, the Sapphire version of the Lucid Air is unbelievably quick, incredibly smooth and undeniably impressive.\n\nVersus the competition: A Tesla Model S Plaid might — might — be able to catch one on a track, but it can’t hold a candle to the Lucid’s sophisticated chassis tuning, luxurious interior and knockout styling.\n\nBehold one of the quickest passenger vehicles ever made. I don’t mean it’s the quickest electric vehicle or the quickest four-door sedan, I mean it’s one of the quickest cars ever to have four wheels and carry humans. This is the 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire, and after driving it for a week on the streets of southeast Michigan, I’m surprised about a few things.\n\nRelated: 2024 Lucid Air Grand Touring Gets Efficiency Tweaks, Range Remains 516 Miles\n\nFirst, I’m surprised I’m not in jail and still have a driver’s license. I’m surprised my eyeballs haven’t gone out of round because of the car’s ferocious acceleration. I’m surprised I actually got paid to drive this electric stealth fighter. But what I’m most surprised about is that I finally have a definitive answer to a question I get a lot: What’s the best thing you’ve driven this year? Folks, it’s this. This is the best thing I’ve driven in 2024. Allow me to tell you why.\n\nWhat’s a Sapphire?\n\nYou should know by now that Lucid is an upstart luxury American automaker that’s been building cars for a few years. This is my third stint behind the wheel of the company’s Air sedan. The first time was a brief drive through Los Angeles; the second was a longer test in Michigan, when I was absolutely blown away by how incredibly good the dual-motor Dream Edition was. But this third time was a new animal: It might not look much different from a standard single- or dual-motor Air, but this is the range-topping tri-motor Sapphire.\n\nThe Sapphire’s two rear motors and single front motor are good for a mind-melting 1,234 horsepower. It puts that power down through electronically controlled all-wheel drive. There’s no mechanical limited-slip differential here; it uses software to balance the incredible 1,430 pounds-feet of torque that goes to the wheels. Lucid developed the traction control, torque vectoring and stability control software itself. The Sapphire rides on 20-inch wheels up front and 21-inchers in the rear, sporting Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer tires that extend the Sapphire’s track width. They also feature a custom rubber compound that optimizes both straight-line stability and efficiency with seemingly endless cornering grip. Its 118-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery is big but not super-huge, and the Sapphire has an EPA-estimated driving range of 427 miles on a charge. The brake discs are carbon ceramic, with a unique long-chain carbon compound that Lucid says is good for heat dissipation. They’re squeezed by 10-piston front calipers and four-pot rears.  \n\nWhat does all of this incredible power and technology get you? A four-door, five-seat sedan that can go from 0-60 mph in 1.89 seconds, according to Lucid, and that tops out at 205 mph. I can’t even convey to you how unbelievably, blisteringly quick that is. It takes longer to say “1.89 seconds” than it does to go from 0-60 mph in a Lucid Air Sapphire. To call this thing bonkers just doesn’t cut it. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nAs crazy as it is, though, it’s not easy to differentiate a Sapphire from a more mundane version of the Air — and that’s just how Lucid likes it. This isn’t an in-your-face, brightly hued, everybody-look-at-me Lamborghini; this sucker is meant to fly completely under the radar, not be noticed by your local constabulary. It’s essentially meant to be a visual black hole in the universe, letting it go insanely fast and get away with it. Visually, it sits a little bit lower than a standard Lucid Air, and it has some additional aerodynamic aids in the form of a new splitter up front, a carbon-fiber spoiler out back and some underbody bits you can’t see. It all adds up to an additional 400 pounds of downforce at top speed. \n\nThere’s also some very subtle Sapphire badging on the front splitter, rear trunk lid and rear roof pillars, and its Sapphire Blue Metallic color is exclusive to the trim. The overall aesthetic, though, is barely different from the standard Air; it’s only noticeably changed when viewed side by side.\n\nSame Story Inside\n\nIt’s much the same story on the inside. The lovely signature Sapphire color is in there, along with some beautiful trim and the innate packaging efficiency that Lucid is known for. I’ve said it before, but the fact that this is the first vehicle from a brand-new startup company is astonishing: The layout, usability and ease of operation of the touch-sensitive controls absolutely shames established luxury automakers. It’s roughly the same size on the outside as a mid-size Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, but it’s as big as a full-size S-Class sedan on the inside. Five full-size passengers can sit in it comfortably, with plenty of headroom and legroom. The roof is a little low, making ingress and egress a bit challenging, but once you’re inside, it’s just glorious. Everything feels luxurious and well put together, and the controls are nicely thought out and expensive-feeling. The materials quality positively shames any Tesla. It’s not as outrageous or space-shippy as the new Mercedes-EQ models, and it doesn’t require a Ph.D. in computer science to operate any of its touchscreen controls.\n\nThere are a couple of changes inside from lesser trims, like the Sapphire’s more heavily bolstered front sport seats. It isn’t meant to be a pure track monster, though, so the seats also have heating, cooling and massage functions. The head restraints can be positioned to accommodate a helmet for track driving, and the Sapphire has a kickin’ audio system — including something no factory Tesla has: Apple CarPlay. And I don’t know how many Alcantaras had to die to trim the headliner, steering wheel and seats, but the sacrifice was not in vain. It’s a beautiful interior, though all Lucid Airs have beautiful interiors. Not all Lucid Airs can do what this one can when you put your foot down.\n\nGet In, Hold On\n\nIt’s nigh impossible to convey with words just how terrifyingly fast this car is. When I pushed the go pedal, everyone I put in the passenger seat yelled words that would get this review heavily censored. Everyone swears in this car — everyone. And it’s completely justified. \n\nThe Sapphire has a few different drive modes. There’s Smooth, which is for your normal, everyday operation. Swift turns things up a bit but still doesn’t let you use the car’s full power; both Smooth and Swift limit output to 767 horses. Then there’s Sapphire mode, which unleashes a lot of the car’s abilities, dialing output up to 1,121 hp. This is the most extreme street mode you’d want to use; to unleash all of this car’s potential, you really need a track. Above Sapphire mode is Track mode, which has three submodes — and only in one of those do you get all of this car’s power. Dragstrip Track mode brings all 1,234 hp, and it’s meant to get you the best 0-60 and quarter-mile times this car can manage. Hot Lap Track mode engages a special cooling system that chills the powertrain for consistent lap times; it gives you 1,003 hp to play with. Endurance Track mode is for more relaxed track-lapping, helping you get consistent times but not depleting the battery so quickly in the process. It allows “just” 767 hp, but it engages the powertrain cooling system, as well.\n\nWhen you pop this car into Sapphire mode, which is the most you’ll really want to do out on the street, and floor it, well — \n\nAcceleration. \n\nIs. \n\nInsane. \n\nIt’s incredibly powerful, taking off in a way that’s instantaneous and mind-bending. It screws with your equilibrium, and you’ll find your arms aching as you force them to hold on to the steering wheel in the face of all those G-forces. One passenger told me he felt his vision blur and the blood flow from his legs. Everyone, everyone, says a dirty word when you floor it. \n\nYou do, then, have to be very, very careful where and how you exercise that power. (Yes, with great power does come great responsibility.) You can find yourself running out of braking distance very quickly, but the big carbon-ceramic brakes do great work hauling you back from the brink of disaster. One thing you’ll notice as the speed climbs and acceleration builds, though, is that it’s just so incredibly stable. There’s zero jankiness in the operation of the Sapphire — no squirrelly moments under hard acceleration, no scariness or flightiness — but also no throaty engine roar or drama other than the scenery instantly blurring outside the windows.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nAirDrop: Lucid Cuts Prices on 2024 Air by Thousands\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Lucid Air?\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nEvery New Electric Car Starting Price and Range Available Right Now\n\nIt also corners amazingly well. Flat, stable and drama-free, it tracks where you point it, with a nimble chassis and incredible ride quality. That’s what really sticks out when you toss this thing around potholed, broken pavement: ride quality is stunning. Even in its sportier modes, the Sapphire is never harsh or unpleasant. The sophistication with which the Air Sapphire goes about its business is unparalleled. I wasn’t joking when I said this is the best thing I’ve driven this year; it’s damn near perfect in everything from its feel and feedback to its speed and silence. It’s a luxurious, easy-to-drive, electric stealth fighter. And I love everything about it … with two very specific exceptions.\n\nTwo Things That Upset Me\n\nFirst is the cost. It’s roughly $250,000, which is more than three times the price of a base, single-motor Lucid Air Pure and more than twice the price of a dual-motor Lucid Air Grand Touring, both of which are also extremely nice luxury vehicles. But for what this car can do, $250,000 is pretty much spot on when you consider its performance spanks just about every exotic car ever made. \n\nThe second thing I don’t like about the Lucid Air Sapphire is that everybody, everybody, is in your way when you drive it. You are the apex predator in this thing, and every other car out there is slower than you. It’s frustrating as hell and one of the reasons I should never be allowed to own a Lucid Air Sapphire: I am not a patient person and would end up in jail with a suspended license in short order. It’s just that much fun, that capable and that fast, folks. It’s the best thing I’ve driven all year, and the competition isn’t even close. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lucid Air?\n\nThe 2023 Lucid Air is an electric five-seat luxury sedan with an EPA-estimated driving range of 384 miles to 516 miles, depending on trim level and equipment. That’s the longest on the market (at least for the moment), bettering rivals like the Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Audi E-Tron GT and Porsche Taycan. Sleek and highly aerodynamic, the base Pure trim has a single electric motor that sends 480 horsepower to the rear wheels via a single-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is optional, as are more powerful electric powertrains that turn the Air into one of the quickest-accelerating vehicles on sale today. DC fast charging allows the Air to add 300 miles of range in only 20 minutes.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lucid Air?\n\nA new range-topping Sapphire trim is slated to join the Air lineup for the 2023 model year. With a tri-motor powertrain that delivers around 1,200 hp  and a claimed top speed in excess of 200 mph, it’s no wonder Lucid is asking around $250,000 for this wildly powerful EV. Also available is a new package that replaces the Air’s exterior brightwork with dark-gray trim and black alloy wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lucid Air Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n34-inch “Glass Cockpit” instrument display and infotainment system\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nPower-retractable touchscreen\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nThree USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nQuad-zone climate control\n10-speaker stereo\n19-inch alloy wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\nGlass roof\nAll-wheel drive\n21-inch alloy wheels\n21-speaker stereo\nDreamDrive Pro highway driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lucid Air?\n\nIf you want the most driving range of any electric vehicle currently on sale and have the means to afford one, the Lucid Air is highly recommended. Extremely efficient and incredibly powerful, this electric sedan is at the cutting edge of technology. The cabin is elegant and spacious, though its reliance on touchscreen controls for almost every vehicle function does take some getting used to.",
