      "expert_review": "Is the Lucid Gravity a Good SUV?\n\nAn elegant design, a monstrously powerful drivetrain, sharp driving dynamics and a long list of amenities make the all-new 2026 Lucid Gravity one of the most interesting and alluring electric luxury SUVs on the market today.\n\nHow Does the Lucid Gravity Compare With Other Electric SUVs?\n\nWith a starting price of just over $96,000 (including destination) at launch, the Lucid Gravity is up against some of the heaviest hitters in the electric SUV space. Larger, more expensive and better equipped than the Tesla Model X, the Gravity hits the sweet spot between it and the pricier Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV.\n\nNow, this is a challenging review. Not so much that the 2026 Lucid Gravity is difficult to understand or to render judgment upon — it’s Lucid’s first SUV, and it’s darn good — but the task of contextualizing a fully formed, new-to-market product so wholly distinct from that of any other automaker is a daunting task.\n\nRelated: 2024 Lucid Air Sapphire Review: Prepare to Swear\n\nI’ll take the easy way out. The all-new Gravity is essentially the SUV evolution of the Lucid Air sedan, complete with a shared platform, switchgear, trim strata and digital interface. As you’d expect of a similar related-product deployment from a legacy automaker, the design, presence and driving experience will be quite familiar to anyone with seat time in the Air.\n\nWhat Is the Lucid Gravity?\n\nAnd much like the Air, the Gravity is intricately engineered and impressively executed to a stunning degree — but I’m not sure it lands on the automotive landscape with the same impact as the Air did back in 2021. The electric-vehicle landscape just four years ago — particularly the luxury EV market — was an entirely different epoch versus today. Full-bore, ground-up electric efforts from established brands were still shaking off primordial ooze as the Air stunned critics and captured headlines. Many of us were struck by the Lucid’s organic elegance and relentlessly clever engineering; yours truly even labeled the lovely Air as “not so much the EV 2.0, but the Car 3.0.”\n\nRecontextualizing the past only gets easier with time, but 2021 still seems so close in human years despite the significant automotive changes that have taken place. In the four to five model years since, we’ve seen meaningful mid-cycle refreshes of existing EVs and the launch of some seriously good ones, most notably from the South Korean brands. The national charging infrastructure is more robust than ever before (but with so, so much more work to do).\n\n2026 Lucid Gravity | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Much Power and Range Does the Lucid Gravity Have?\n\nAll this to say, the Gravity is a generally excellent luxury two- or three-row SUV in an era of the automobile that is equally remarkable as it is uncertain. What is certain, however, is the competitiveness of the Gravity’s specs sheet; all versions at the media drive program were outfitted in identical $96,625 Grand Touring trim — the sole spec offered at launch — that blurs cityscapes and country tableaus with 828 horsepower and 909 pounds-feet of torque. Two electric motors are fed by a 123-kilowatt-hour battery pack, returning a minimum of 386 miles of estimated range and a maximum of 450 miles, depending on chosen wheel size and seating capacity.\n\nThat 450-mile range is quite competitive, but the Gravity’s charging capability is where it pulls further ahead. A standard North American Charging System charge port gives access to Tesla’s sprawling Supercharger network without an adapter, with the Gravity capable of stellar DC fast-charging speeds of up to 400 kilowatts that, in ideal conditions, can add 200 miles of range in less than 12 minutes, according to Lucid.\n\nThis electric drivetrain also spins the 0-60 mph time down to an eye-jellying 3.4 seconds, according to Lucid, quick enough to reduce your choice of five or seven occupants to a blubbering, knee-knocking mess. Lucid’s quite proud of the Gravity’s performance, with much emphasis put on the SUV’s multifaceted capability. Depending on which engineer you talked to, the Gravity is perfect for city commuting, long-distance road-trippin’, hitting the local off-road park or putting down a sizzling time at your next track day. Naturally, we’ve heard the same “jack-of-all” refrain from other automakers, but the Lucid’s inherent adaptability does give some credence to this sentiment, tempered as it is by reality.\n\nIs the Lucid Gravity Comfortable?\n\nAll Gravity Grand Touring trims float around on a standard air suspension, and it can be battened down by an available Dynamic Handling Package that replaces the usual single-chamber air system with a complex three-chamber setup. An impressive ride-height range from as low as 5.2 inches of ground clearance to as high as 9.3 inches means you don’t have to sacrifice rough-road capability for better performance when the way turns squiggly.\n\nKeeping in step with the Air source material, it’s a technological powerhouse. It’s clearly built and developed by a group of engineers who relish in the simplicity and essentialness offered by the relatively unexplored nature of EV architecture, riding the fine line between overcomplexity and elegance.\n\nThis behind-the-scenes stuff is tremendously impressive, but this is not a Porsche 911 GT3 RS, nor is it a slice of intricate, seam-riveted prewar rolling sculpture. It’s a luxury electric SUV, and I expect most customers will evaluate it on pricing, range, user-focused technology and interior amenities. Left alone in the Smooth driving mode — Lucidspeak for “Comfort/Normal” — the Gravity is mostly silky over mixed tarmac surfaces. Road noise is kept to impressively low levels, and pavement granularity is almost entirely isolated from the cabin.\n\nStill, the ride in my specific test vehicle wasn’t quite as cushy as you might expect. Whether due to the Dynamic Handling Package or the Gravity’s general character, it’s definitely on the stiffer side of the compliance spectrum. Body composure and control is excellent, but you’ll likely feel more of the craggier stuff than those accustomed to air suspensions might expect. Compared with the memory-foam cruise of the regular Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV, this leans closer to something with AMG badging.\n\nHow Does the Lucid Gravity Drive?\n\nGiven the aforementioned body control, handling is requisitely impressive. Toggled into Sprint mode, the Gravity barrels down California country roads with the confidence of a top-tier performance SUV both in speed and composure. Straight-line shootin’ from a dig of the accelerator results in impressive neck snaps and chest pressure, but there’s clearly space left for a (potential!) future Sapphire hypervariant with four figures of power and strong enough acceleration to cause blackout.\n\nBut that’s (potentially!) to come. For now, the Gravity Grand Touring is exactly as impressive as you’d expect an 828-hp electric super-sled to be. Its handling is beyond capable for your average daily needs and will absolutely thrill you when you find your way to a back road.\n\nIt’s the day-to-day stuff that impresses the most. Brake blend between pure regenerative resistance and the physical brakes is excellent, as are the distinct levels of off-accelerator regenerative braking, the most aggressive of which allows full one-pedal driving. In all drive modes, operation was never less than buttercream smooth, with in-traffic driving made properly analgesic thanks to the Gravity’s heady suite of active driver-assist features.\n\nHow Is the Lucid Gravity’s Interior?\n\nI’d love to talk more on that, but I’m afraid I spent more time futzing with Lucid’s fresh UX 3.0, the latest iteration of the automaker’s impressive digital interface that manages most infotainment and vehicle functions. The center 12.6-inch organic light-emitting diode screen handles most of the core controls, including climate, navigation display and configuration, seat functions like available massage and ventilation, drive modes and vehicle settings.\n\nAll standard stuff, all packaged in a user interface that’s impressively reactive and easy to navigate. The massive 34-inch-wide dash-top display is the cockpit centerpiece, with much of the menu and function operation handled via haptic touchpads on the front of the steering wheel. Swiping and scrolling in any direction will bring up a temporary menu display ahead of the driver, letting you toggle volume, entertainment and hands-free driving, among other features.\n\nThis is also how you adjust both side mirrors and the steering-wheel position, requiring a brief moment of mental rewiring from the way these things are adjusted in most cars. It’s a process that’s intuitive but unfamiliar, no doubt made easier with time and the fact that you’re unlikely to readjust the cockpit more than once or twice a year.\n\nOutside of this digital world, the rest of the cockpit is a lovely place to wick away the miles. As with the Air, Lucid claims the mid-century design ethos and aesthetic as one of the driving inspirations for its interior spaces. There are gentle, sweeping lines that give way to drop edges and tight tolerances between distinct materials. Fit and finish is as you’d perhaps find in a finely appointed modernist office, complete with Eames-esque seating structure, scavenged wood, a carefully curated color palette and excellent attention to detail.\n\n2026 Lucid Gravity | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Is Passenger Comfort in the Lucid Gravity?\n\nThat last bit has been a key hallmark of Lucid since day one. It’s hard to find a panel, surface or trim placement that doesn’t feel purposeful. The interiors are far from visually arresting, but there’s little air of mass production in the details; on the Air, it was the stitched leather loop on the underfloor access tray, and on the Gravity, it’s the impressively engineered available tray tables for the second row.\n\nPassengers have it good in the Gravity, with oodles of charging and infotainment to be had in the second row. Passenger space is perhaps the most luxurious aspect, with remarkable levels of head-, shoulder and legroom in all rows. Yes, all rows — my 5-foot-11-inch frame was more than comfortable in steerage, with Lucid’s comparably compact battery pack allowing for a flat floor in all rows. And if you’ve got more cargo than folks, the Gravity’s got you covered to a wild degree. There’s 120 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume by Lucid’s measurements, and that includes the frunk space, which is capable of swallowing 8.1 cubic feet of gear on its own.\n\nOh dear, another bit of trickiness: knowing when to stop. Contrary to what it might seem, I’ve just scratched the surface of the 2026 Lucid Gravity. There’s so much that’s new and distinct about the Gravity when juxtaposed against the competitive field that it’s tougher to find equivalents than comparables. Around 100 miles and an afternoon wasn’t enough — consider this an amuse-bouche to when we get a Gravity for further testing. Or, find out for yourself, as Lucid order books are open now.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Lucid Gravity: Standard Tesla Port, Up to 450 Miles of Range\n2025 Lucid Air Pure Quick Spin: Life Is Good at the Cheap End of the Lucid Showroom\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nResearch the 2026 Lucid Gravity\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
