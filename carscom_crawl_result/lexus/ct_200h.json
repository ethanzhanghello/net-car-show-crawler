      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Lexus CT200h. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMinor changes may not make the 2013 CT 200h feel like an “all-new” model, but it remains one of the most charming hybrids on the market.\n\nA luxury hybrid isn’t an easy sell. A luxury hybrid with sporty intensions is an even harder one. Yet ever since Lexus’ compact CT 200h hatchback debuted a few years ago, it has impressed by exuding cool and still delivering results at the pump.\n\nThe 2013 edition gets a few minor changes, most notably a new schnoz that takes on the spindle design of the new GS, ES and even the RX SUV. There’s also a new F Sport version, which I tested for this review.\n\nYou can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nGreen Performance\nThe CT 200h looks a lot faster than it is; I wouldn’t call acceleration the car’s strong suit. Other editors pointed to sluggish off-the-line speed, an uncivilized continuously variable automatic transmission and unresponsive throttle.\n\nHit a road with even the slightest curvature, though, and you realize why the CT 200h is so appealing. The little hatch flings around curves with a light-footed nimbleness reserved for small roadsters, not front-wheel-drive hatchbacks. In fact, its turning radius is even smaller than the standard Mini Cooper hardtop.\n\nThree drive modes — Eco, Normal and Sport — allow for some adjustments. Indeed, when set in Sport, the steering tightens and the CVT revs slightly stronger. Eco dampens the accelerator more than any other setting, making the CT slow for the sake of better mileage.\n\nAnd what of mileage? Rated 43/40/42 mpg city/highway/combined, the CT falls in the middle of modern hybrids, but it holds a unique space in the luxury market. There are no 50 mpg hybrids like the Toyota Prius from luxury brands. Acura’s new ILX Hybrid sedan has EPA numbers of 39/38/38 mpg. A gas-powered automatic Mini Cooper, in comparison, rates 28/36/31 mpg.\n\nDriving aggressively around town with the kids over a weekend, and on a few 45-mile round-trip commutes, the trip computer read an impressive 39 mpg almost the entire time, dipping below that figure mostly in suburbia. The weather was in the low 30s most of the time, which can lower mileage in any vehicle type but especially hybrids.\n\nInterior\nThe outside may have gotten a few upgrades, but inside remains the same as the last CT I tested a few years ago. It’s a nice interior, but it doesn’t scream “luxury,” and it just feels small.\n\nOur test car’s all-black interior made an already tight cabin feel even more confining, but I had plenty of headroom and legroom when driving alone. After I put my kids in the backseat, however, I had to move my seat up farther than I was comfortable with to give them room.\n\nI’m average height, at 5-foot-10, and I found the front to be a bit small. Taller editors complained loudly, one saying he felt like he was in a cave.\n\nThe materials are decent for an entry-level luxury car, but at $32,945 to start, the CT 200h isn’t exactly cheap (all prices cited include destination charges). The roomier ILX Hybrid starts at $29,795 but packs less driving fun. For another $1,000, the F Sport trim on the Lexus added a claustrophobia-inducing black headliner to the black interior, as well as a unique steering wheel. Yet the car comes with faux-leather seat covering called NuLuxe. Leather costs an additional $1,330.\n\nLexus’ optional navigation and multimedia system in my test car is a generation behind versions I’ve tested in the new GS and ES. The control mimics a computer mouse, but requires commands to be entered via a button on the side, where your thumb rests. Newer versions let you click on the controller itself. The 7-inch display screen is also considerably smaller than the 12.3-inch screens the larger sedans pack.\n\nDespite its ease of use, I’m not sure the option is worth its $2,735 price. An upgraded stereo isn’t part of the package; it comes in an $890 Premium Package, which buyers are unlikely to escape on the cars already on dealer lots.\n\nCargo\nI was a bit surprised by how much room the hatch provided. I was expecting something close to the Mini Cooper’s 5.7 cubic feet, but it’s rated at 14.3 cubic feet. The CT 200h fit a day of shopping trips with my kids — meaning the bags had to fit without the rear seats folding down.\n\nThe added utility of the hatch and folding rear seats definitely sets the CT apart from the ILX: The hybrid sedan has only 10 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety deemed the CT 200h a Top Safety Pick, representing Good ratings in side, rear and medium-overlap frontal crash tests as well as roof strength. A more strenuous small-overlap front test has yet to be performed on the CT 200h.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not crash-tested the CT 200h.\n\nCT 200h in the Market\nIs there even a market for a sporty, luxury, hatchback hybrid? Judging by CT 200h sales to date, there’s a small one; it has clearly been a success as a niche car.\n\nIt’s easy to see why people like it. It delivers inspired handling and 40 mpg, with a small amount of utility thrown in.\n\nThe price may keep some shoppers away, though — there are plenty of thrills for less money at dealerships, even if they do cost more at the pump.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Minor changes may not make the 2013 Lexus CT 200h feel like an “all-new” model, but it remains one of the most charming hybrids on the market.\n\nA luxury hybrid isn’t an easy sell. A leather-trimmed luxury hybrid with performance-oriented intensions is an even harder one. Yet ever since Lexus’ compact CT 200h hatchback debuted a few years ago, it has impressed by exuding cool and still delivering results at the pump.\n\nThe 2013 edition gets a few minor changes, most notably a new schnoz that takes on the spindle design of the new GS, ES and even the RX SUV. There’s also a new F Sport version, which I tested for this review.\n\nYou can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nGreen Performance\nThis little Lexus looks a lot faster than it is; I wouldn’t call acceleration the car’s strong suit. Other editors pointed to sluggish off-the-line speed, an uncivilized continuously variable automatic transmission and unresponsive throttle.\n\nHit a road with even the slightest curvature, though, and you realize why the Lexus CT200h is so appealing. The little hatch flings it’s tail-like rear wiper around curves with a light-footed nimbleness reserved for small roadsters, not front-wheel-drive hatchbacks. In fact, its turning radius is even smaller than the standard Mini Cooper hardtop.\n\nThree drive modes — Eco, Normal and Sport — allow for some adjustments. Indeed, when set in Sport, the steering tightens and the CVT revs slightly stronger. Eco dampens the accelerator more than any other setting, making the Lexus CT slow for the sake of better mileage.\n\nAnd what of fuel economy? Rated 43/40/42 mpg city/highway/combined, the multimedia CT falls in the middle of modern hybrids, but it holds a unique space in the luxury market. There are no 50 mpg hybrids like the Toyota Prius from luxury brands. Acura’s new ILX Hybrid sedan has EPA fuel economy numbers of 39/38/38 mpg. A gas-powered automatic Mini Cooper, in comparison, rates 28/36/31 mpg.\n\nDriving the Lexus aggressively around town (on alloy wheels with all-season tires) with the kids over a weekend, and on a few 45-mile round-trip commutes, the trip computer read an impressive 39 mpg almost the entire time, dipping below that figure mostly in suburbia. The weather was in the low 30s most of the time, which can lower mileage in any vehicle type but especially hybrids.\n\nInterior\nThe outside may have gotten a few upgrades, but inside remains the same as the last CT I tested a few years ago. It’s a nice interior, but it doesn’t scream “luxury,” and it just feels small.\n\nOur test Lexus’ all-black interior made an already tight cabin feel even more confining, but I had plenty of headroom and legroom when driving alone. After I put my kids in the backseat, however, I had to move my seat up farther than I was comfortable with to give them room.\n\nI’m average height, at 5-foot-10, and I found the front to be a bit small. Taller editors complained loudly, one saying he felt like he was in a cave.\n\nThe materials are decent for an entry-level luxury car, but at $32,945 to start, the Lexus CT 200h isn’t exactly cheap (all prices cited include destination charges). The roomier ILX Hybrid starts at $29,795 but packs less driving fun. For another $1,000, the 200h F Sport trim on the Lexus added a claustrophobia-inducing black headliner to the black interior, as well as a unique steering wheel. Yet the car comes with faux-leather seat covering called NuLuxe. Leather costs an additional $1,330.\n\nLexus’ optional multimedia and navigation system in my test car is a generation behind versions I’ve tested in the new GS and ES. The control mimics a computer mouse, but requires commands to be entered via a button on the side, where your thumb rests. Newer versions let you click on the controller itself. The 7-inch display screen is also considerably smaller than the 12.3-inch screens the larger sedans pack.\n\nDespite its ease of use, I’m not sure the option is worth its $2,735 price. An upgraded stereo isn’t part of the package; it comes in an $890 Premium Package, which buyers are unlikely to escape on the cars already on dealer lots.\n\nCargo\nI was a bit surprised by how much room the hatch provided. I was expecting something close to the Mini Cooper’s 5.7 cubic feet, but it’s rated at 14.3 cubic feet. The CT 200h fit a day of shopping trips with my kids — meaning the bags had to fit without the rear seats folding down.\n\nThe added utility of the hatch and folding rear seats definitely sets the CT apart from the ILX: The hybrid sedan has only 10 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety deemed the Lexus CT 200h a Top Safety Pick, representing Good ratings in side, rear and medium-overlap frontal crash tests as well as roof strength. A more strenuous small-overlap front test has yet to be performed on the CT 200h.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not crash-tested the CT 200h.\n\nCT 200h in the Market\nIs there even a market for a sporty, luxury, hatchback hybrid? Judging by Lexus CT 200h sales to date, there’s a small one; it has clearly been a success as a niche car.\n\nIt’s easy to see why people like the Lexus CT 200h. It delivers inspired handling and 40 mpg, with a small amount of utility thrown in.\n\nThe price may keep some shoppers away, though — there are plenty of thrills for less money at dealerships, even if they do cost more at the pump.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "I have a strong affinity for both the aesthetics and functionality of most hatchbacks. I was waiting with bated breath to drive the all-new 2011 Lexus CT 200h because I assumed it’d be a lux version of a hatchback hybrid. It didn’t live up to my expectations.\n\nThe CT 200h got two out of three right: It is a hybrid, and it has a functional little hatch, but it disappoints in the lux department, with a fit and finish that feels like a cheaper Toyota Prius masquerading as an entry-level Lexus.\n\nDriving the five-seater is a zippy blast. It has a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with an electronically controlled continuously variable automatic transmission. It looks cute and fast, and it can live up to that expectation when in Sport mode, but the tradeoff is its fuel economy. It gets 43/40 mpg city/highway, which isn’t nearly as impressive as the Prius’ 51/48 mpg.\n\nWhen in normal or Eco mode, the CT 200h feels like any other hybrid, lagging a little in the initial acceleration but driving quite nicely once up to speed. The EV mode, which allows you to drive in electric mode only, was nearly useless. You have to have enough juice in the battery, drive at a snail’s pace and barely touch the accelerator to keep in in EV mode. I didn’t have the patience for it.\n\nThe CT seemed a little rough in the suspension department, feeling more like a $20,000 Mazda than a $30,000-plus Lexus on rough pavement.\n\nThe base level CT 200h starts at $29,120. My test car, the higher Premium trim, starts at $30,900. The final price tag on my test car was $35,819.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhat I love so much about hatchbacks is they often have that perfect blend of cute looks and sporty appeal. The CT 200h is no exception. The low, seemingly ready-to-pounce ground clearance, center-mounted antenna and rear spoiler add to the sporty look on the CT. Its looks and standard front-wheel drive were just begging for a twisty mountain road and an advertising agency’s film crew to document its trek with artsy craftsmanship.\n\nThere aren’t many CT 200hs on the road yet. As a matter of fact, other than my test car I’ve never seen one out and about near Denver. My test car did seem to turn quite a few heads. I’m not sure if it was the car itself or the love-it-or-hate-it Daybreak Yellow Mica paint on my test car. Descriptions of the color by my family members ranged from “baby poop” and “llama phlegm” to “’70s shag carpet.” It’s just hard to see the beauty in any of that. Rest assured, the CT 200h does come in a slew of other more — ahem — appealing colors.\n\nMy favorite feature is the uber-functional cargo area created by the hatchback design. It’s just the right amount of space for light family use: an adults-only weekend trip, a full week’s worth of grocery shopping or the annual Varela Family Great Closet Cleanout and Donation Run (pictured below).\n\nThe Lexus CT 200h has a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with an electric motor/generator to make a combined 134 horsepower. The CT 200h gets an EPA-estimated 43/40 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe CT’s interior was quite functional for a small family. My two daughters fit well in the backseat with enough legroom for the parents in the front row to move our seats back a little.\n\nAs the designated family chauffeur, I appreciated the thoughtfully designed space up front. In addition to the two cupholders in the center console, I loved the shallow storage tray that held any combination of parking garage tickets, a Starbucks gift card, lip balm and lip gloss, plus a separate spot for loose change and a great vertical pocket for a smartphone or cellphone. The front doors also sport in-door storage bins with bottle holders.\n\nThe CT 200h has a few “luxurious” features. My test car had the optional $1,330 Leather Package that includes black leather seats with fashion-forward white contrast stitching. It also had heated front seats and a keyless entry and start system.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed that Lexus seemed to cheap-out in other areas of this hybrid. I expected to find ventilated seats, a power liftgate, power front seats, an acoustic windshield to keep noise to a minimum and door-handle panels that don’t fall off.\n\nWhat? Door-handle panels that don’t fall off? Yep, the passenger-side door’s grab handle popped off on several occasions when my husband grabbed it to pull the door closed. I was getting ready to chalk it up to this being an overused, abused and possibly pre-production test car until I heard this same problem from a colleague in a different city.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 CT 200h has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must get the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, roof-strength and rear crash tests as well as have electronic stability control. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t yet tested the CT 200h.\n\nThis hybrid has some of the best Latch connectors I’ve seen recently. Small zippered openings reveal easy access to the two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. My daughters’ Britax high-back booster seats with side-impact head protection fit just fine in the CT. They were able to easily reach and buckle their own seat belts. The seat belt buckles are on stable bases, making buckling easier for young kids with limited dexterity. To find out how the CT 200h did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check, click here.\n\nBesides an electronic stability system, the CT 200h has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes, traction control and eight airbags, including driver and front passenger knee airbags and side curtains for both rows. The CT also features Lexus Safety Connect with automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle location, an emergency assist button and one year of enhanced roadside assistance. Peace of mind is priceless when you’re using your car as a family hauler.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Lexus CT 200h here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2011 about the 2011 Lexus CT 200h. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAmericans love hybrid hatchbacks, but mostly for the hybrid part; overall, we’re still lukewarm on traditional hatchbacks. Lexus added a third ingredient — budget luxury — to create the CT 200h. With a starting price just over $29,000, it’s the least expensive Lexus in nearly two decades, and it shows.\n\nThe 2011 CT 200h feels at times like a cut-rate Lexus, but its combination of fuel efficiency and handling should win the brand some much-needed younger buyers.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive CT’s styling is the closest yet to Lexus’ LF-Gh concept, and it comes in base and Premium trims, which you can compare here. We evaluated a CT 200h Premium.\n\nThrust vs. Thrift\nThanks to the drivetrain’s immediate thrust, the CT 200h has adequate oomph for driving solo: It scoots from a stoplight well enough and maintains highway speeds with little trouble. But it lacks the reserves to pass on a whim, and barreling up to 60 or 70 mph from an on-ramp runs the poor thing out of steam. (And kilowatts, as it were.) Confident acceleration should be a given in any luxury car, even an entry-level one. Were it not for the instant power starting out — a characteristic of most hybrids, thanks to their torque-rich electric motors — I’d deem the CT a dog. As it stands, many luxury shoppers will indeed find the Lexus too poky.\n\nAt least the pokiness pays off in gas mileage. The CT has the same 1.8-liter four-cylinder and 60-kilowatt electric motor as the Prius hybrid (from Lexus parent Toyota). Total output for the engine and motor matches the Prius’ 134 horsepower, and the CT’s EPA-estimated combined mileage is 42 mpg. That’s 8 mpg short of the more aerodynamic Prius but well ahead of the diesel-powered Audi A3 TDI (34 mpg), the Volvo C30 (24 mpg) and the BMW 128i (22 mpg). What’s more, the CT runs on regular unleaded gas — not the norm for luxury cars. Based on my experience, the EPA figures seem conservative: On a 129-mile highway trip into the wind, I observed 43.5 mpg on the CT’s trip computer. With a stiff tailwind on the return leg, another editor reported nearly 60 mpg. Temperatures both legs were in the high 40s.\n\nLike most full hybrids, the CT can cruise on electric power alone at low speeds. An EV button maximizes the distance it can go on just electric — about a mile, if the hybrid battery is full — but requires featherweight acceleration, low overall speed and a near-comatose driver behind you. Other driving modes include Eco, Normal and Sport; our observed mileage came largely in Normal mode. Sport mode hastens drivetrain response and holds engine revs longer. It’s enough to give illusions of power around town, but the fun is short-lived. Stand on the gas, and the drivetrain’s shallow limits show.\n\nHandling, Braking & Ride Quality\nIf the CT stumbles in acceleration, it shines in handling. The steering wheel turns with a light touch at low speeds in Eco and Normal mode, but it wanders too much on the highway. Sport mode dials back the assist, improving feedback and highway stability a great deal. It also relaxes the threshold of the CT’s standard stability system, which intervenes smoothly when it must. (Alas, there’s no way to deactivate the stability system.) Drive the CT hard, and the nose pushes mildly, but the tail follows soon after — a dynamic that belies the car’s nose-heavy 60/40 (front/rear) weight distribution. Nicely done, Lexus.\n\nLike its competitors, the CT rides firmly. We detected no flex, and the car stays planted on broken pavement, but the suspension doesn’t isolate very well. Major bumps produce loud ka-thunks, and too often the car surrenders to the plane of the road — up, down, up, down. Driving enthusiasts won’t mind, but the typical Lexus buyer will find the experience too much like an econocar.\n\nLike all hybrids, the CT employs regenerative brakes that help recharge the battery. Lexus says it tuned the brakes for better refinement than the Prius. Indeed, the CT’s pedal feels more linear than the Toyota’s, but our test car’s pedal had a lot of hydraulic noise in the first inch or so of travel. A Toyota spokesman said the brakes should work noise-free, so that might have been an anomaly with our car. See for yourself on your test drive, and click the link at the bottom of the page to send me an assessment.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin materials are inconsistent for a Lexus — too much faux-metal plastic, a cheaper headliner than usual — but the same could be said for most sub-$30,000 luxury cars. For its league, the CT scores a few hits. The stitched upholstery around the instruments and center console evoke a pricier interior, and the optional navigation system’s mouse-like knob controller is a cinch to use. The automatic transmission’s springy electronic shifter mirrors that of the Prius: left and down into Drive, with a button for Park.\n\nSeveral editors noted our car’s tight headroom — at 37.8 inches, it trails the A3, 1 Series and C30. Hemmed in by a high center console and narrow overall cabin, knee and hip room are also tight. The standard eight-way power driver’s seat slides far back, but the tilt/telescoping steering wheel has limited range.\n\nFaux leather is standard; our tester’s optional heated leather seats felt as rich as in any Lexus. The seats are well-cushioned yet supportive, but larger drivers may find them too narrow. The backseat, meanwhile, is as inhospitable as an econocar’s: shoddier finish, no center armrest or reading lights, tiny doors, cramped legroom. The C30 has another 1.3 inches of backseat legroom, and it doesn’t even have rear doors.\n\nCargo room behind the rear seat measures 14.3 cubic feet. With the 60/40-split seats folded, maximum volume totals 32.3 cubic feet. Those figures split the difference between the cargo-deprived C30 and the roomier A3.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe CT 200h achieved top scores in all four crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, earning the car a Top Safety Pick designation. The CT has not been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Click here for a list of standard safety features, or here to see our evaluation of the CT’s child-seat provisions.\n\nOptional features include adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system.\n\nThe $29,120 CT 200h comes well-equipped. Standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, faux leather upholstery, 17-inch alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat, keyless access with push-button start, and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with steering-wheel audio controls and Bluetooth audio streaming. The CT 200h Premium adds a moonroof and heated seats — too little to justify its $1,780 price hike. Unfortunately, tacking on all other options, from a navigation system to genuine leather and an upgraded audio system, require stepping up to the Premium. Bah.\n\nLoad up the CT 200h with factory options, and the sticker tops out around $38,500. Curiously, even at the top end a power passenger seat isn’t available.\n\nCT 200h in the Market\nLexus says CT 200h buyers cross-shop the Audi, BMW and Volvo competition — and the budget-luxury field is set to swell. Expect Mercedes and Infiniti to throw their hats in the ring, too.\n\nBut are the cars that swell? Most are what you’d expect: A half-step down from the brands’ usual fare, but appealing on their own strengths. So it goes with the CT 200h, which combines Lexus touches with a Toyota driving experience. The wild card is styling, where conservative Lexus took a radical leap. It paid off. The car looks sharp, which should draw as many car shoppers as its gas mileage. It may not live up to every tenet of the Lexus badge, but the CT’s prospects seem as bright as our test car’s nuclear-gold paint job.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "All any hybrid needs in order to succeed is results. With EPA-estimated fuel economy of 43/40/42 mpg city/highway/combined, the Lexus CT 200h succeeds if you’re comparing it with non-hybrids. Newer-generation hybrids like the Toyota Prius, Hyundai Ioniq and others have leapfrogged the CT’s efficiency, providing more than 50 mpg — but none come from luxury brands. The next model in Lexus’ hybrid line is the ES 300h mid-size sedan (rated 40/39/40 mpg), the starting price of which is $10,570 higher than the CT’s $32,225 base price (all prices cited include destination charges).\n\nWe tested a CT 200h with the extensive F Sport Package, which alters the car both mechanically and cosmetically, inside and outside.\n\nA key strength of the CT is that there’s nothing else like it, but that also complicates competitive comparisons, which we always provide in Cars.com reviews. Because the CT 200h’s hybrid nature and results are its strongest characteristics, it’s safe to assume potential buyers are drawn primarily by the car’s environmental and/or potential money-saving advantages. For this reason, I’ll compare it below against three other means to the efficiency end — a plug-in hybrid, a diesel and a battery-electric, all in the same pricing ballpark.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Lexus CT 200h has the styling of a sporty little wagon/hatchback. Along with mechanical changes, the optional F Sport Package brings distinct 17-inch wheels, a black roof, six paint choices (including two exclusive colors), metallic front scuff plates, a unique rear spoiler, and a mesh-pattern grille and foglight inserts.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nWithout question, the CT has some sporty attributes, such as its handling. Its small size and ground-hugging profile give it a nimble feel. (As I’ve noted in other Lexus models equipped with an F Sport Package, I don’t think the firmer suspension makes enough difference in the car’s handling to justify the harder ride.) The hybrid nature giveth, but it also taketh away: Having the high-voltage battery pack mounted near the back helps balance out the lopsided weight distribution common to front-wheel-drive cars, resulting in a more balanced feel as the rear wheels share more responsibility for gripping the road when cornering. Unfortunately, the benefits pretty much end there.\n\nBy Lexus’ own estimation, the CT takes 9.8 seconds to reach 60 mph. For comparison, the 2017 Jaguar XE compact sedan equipped with an efficient diesel engine hits 60 in 7.4 seconds, and the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV all-electric hatchback does it in less than 7 seconds, according to their manufacturers. Perhaps more important, the diesel and electric motors are much more responsive off the line and suffer none of the rubber-band effect found in the CT 200h: delayed accelerator response accompanied by droning engine sounds.\n\nHistorically, the most efficient hybrids have forgone conventional step-gear transmissions, like that in the Jaguar, in favor of continuously variable approaches like the CT 200h’s. Make no mistake: The CT’s transmission (we’ll call it a transmission, even though it differs from other types) plays a large part in the car’s efficiency because it incorporates little more than two motor-generators, some gears and a minimal amount of oil. There are no clutches and none of the friction associated with regular transmissions or the belt-and-pulley types of CVTs employed by a growing number of gas-only cars. It’s hard, though, to think of any car with this type of acceleration as sporty, especially when compared with diesel and all-electric competitors.\n\nUnfortunately, the Lexus CT 200h’s braking performance also shares the hallmarks of hybrid regenerative braking — the process by which the electric drive motors act as generators to slow the car while recharging the battery. The action isn’t very linear as the car attempts to blend regeneration with conventional braking. The Jaguar’s conventional brakes have excellent feel, and the Bolt EV, though it also employs regeneration, has better pedal feel and linearity than the CT (though it isn’t to the level of good conventional brakes, either). Both these alternatives are sportier overall than the CT in every way, including handling.\n\nFor what it’s worth, hybrid buyers have accepted these characteristics in more than a million Priuses and similar vehicles, but I was compelled to address how well the CT delivers on its sporty look.\n\nSo what does the Lexus provide for your sacrifice? An EPA-estimated 43/40/42 mpg city/highway/combined on regular gasoline. The fuel economy of the diesel Jaguar XE 20d is rated 32/42/36 mpg, giving it an edge in highway driving. The CT’s combined rating isn’t far behind its city number, the latter of which is far superior to the Jag’s. An EV’s efficiency can’t be compared directly, though EPA tries with an mpg-equivalent formula we generally don’t embrace, but it gives a general idea of a car’s cost of operation. In the Bolt EV’s case, that’s 128/110/119 mpg-e. More relevant is the Bolt EV’s estimated 238 miles of range — remarkable for the technology and price, but not comparable to the CT’s 500 miles and the XE’s 533-mile range. And you can’t ignore two aspects of owning a battery-electric: For one, recharging an EV on long trips is a relatively timely process; it’s doable, but it’s hardly an afterthought, like filling a fuel tank. Second, owning one requires a certain living situation and additional equipment (240-volt charging) to support it along with the associated costs.\n\nAnother option is a plug-in hybrid, like the 2017 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron hatchback — the closest CT competitor in size and styling. We haven’t driven this car, but the details don’t impress. It goes an estimated 16 miles on a charge, then reverts to hybrid operation, where it gets 33/36/34 mpg on premium gas. Though it doesn’t require 240-volt charging to be viable, EV ranges below 20 miles represent a very specific use for a specific buyer. The Audi’s total range with full battery and tank is an estimated 380 miles. We continue to question the value of most plug-in hybrids, including this one.\n\nInside\n\nThough the Lexus CT 200h comes from a luxury brand, it’s certainly not the most luxurious model. I’d describe the quality level as closer to that of subcompact (entry-level) luxury sedans than to compacts. The center console is a bit plasticky, and though the gauges are clean and bright, a supplemental display in the gauge cluster is blocky and monochrome — not up to today’s standards.\n\nThough leather seats are available in two option packages, imitation leather is standard. The NuLuxe imitation-leather upholstery represents a lower dollar value, but it might have its appeal. Vegetarians and vegans are often more interested in green cars than are average shoppers, and they sometimes prefer to minimize animal-based materials in their cars.\n\nFront seat heaters and a power-adjustable passenger seat are optional. A memory driver’s seat comes only with leather, and cooled seats aren’t offered.\n\nThe front is reasonably roomy, with more generous legroom than the competing models mentioned, but the backseat is snug. Legroom is very tight at 32.9 inches, versus 35.4 and 36.5 inches for the A3 e-tron and Bolt EV, respectively. Headroom in back is also in short supply at 37.0 inches. That’s 0.5 inch less than the A3 and 0.9 inch less than the Bolt EV. When it comes to seating dimensions, fractions of an inch are significant. If front headroom is borderline for you, go without the optional moonroof, which robs a half-inch from the front seats.\n\nAlong with the exterior and mechanical changes, the F Sport Package adds an F-Sport-branded perforated-leather steering wheel, a leather-trimmed shift knob, metallic trim, aluminum sport pedals, a black headliner (ceiling fabric) and sport seats with a choice of NuLuxe imitation leather or black genuine leather.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nUnlike some vehicles, the Lexus CT 200h isn’t stingy with real mechanical buttons, and there are no touch-sensitive panels to be seen. The rotary knobs for the stereo are a bit small and could be easier to grasp, even when not wearing gloves, but at least they’re present. The rotary/push knob on the center console would make a great eyes-free gear selector, but instead it merely selects driving modes. The gear selector instead is a springy joystick that will probably annoy you, but you’ll get used to it.\n\nHistory suggests another interface will annoy you, as well, and there will be no relief: the optional Remote Touch controller. Where some automakers forgo a touchscreen and employ a combination rotary knob/push-button — sometimes with joystick properties, as well — Lexus made a move years ago to a mouselike pointing device on the center console that moves a selection point around the on-screen menus. I was more accepting of it than some initially, but changes over time have also made it less to my liking. It’s an awkward system; the best thing I can say is that it’s better than more recent versions in some Lexus models that have a touchpad instead of a mouse. That one seems to be well-hated.\n\nThough it’s not standard, Remote Touch comes in the Display Audio Package, which also includes a premium audio system, a second USB jack, a backup camera, Siri Eyes Free Mode and more. It’s also a prerequisite for some other options, so you can expect dealers to stock cars with Remote Touch. You might be stuck with it.\n\nOnboard navigation calls for the optional Navigation Package, which requires as a prerequisite the Premium Package or Luxury Package — the features of which are unrelated. The interdependence of option packages is a notable downside of the CT 200h, as is the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone interfaces, which would be another way to provide in-dash mapping. On the upside, the navigation system in our CT boasted the best execution I’ve seen of street-view images for decision points: When routing, an upcoming-turn graphic that popped up onscreen showed a tower that looked exactly like what I saw in real life when approaching an off-ramp.\n\nIt may go against the fuel-saving creed of the hybrid buyer, but anyone who wants remote-start capability can opt for Lexus Enform Remote, which allows owners to start or stop the car, lock or unlock it and enjoy some additional features, all through a smartphone app. Once again, it also requires two other options: Enform Safety Connect and an Enform Remote subscription (after one year free).\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nWith cargo volume of 14.3 cubic feet behind the backseat, the Lexus CT 200h edges out the A3 e-tron’s 13.6 cubic feet but trails the Bolt EV’s 16.9 cubic feet. Because hatches and trunks are measured differently, the Jaguar XE sedan’s trunk can’t be compared directly, but the CT’s hatchback and folding backseat make the most of what’s available.\n\nIn-cabin storage is modest, with a decent-sized glove compartment but a small bin under the center armrest. Betraying the car’s age is a phone slot on the center console that’s large enough only for the type of phones you seldom see anymore.\n\nSafety\n\nFor an older model, the CT’s crash-test results are very good. It’s top-rated in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crashworthiness categories in the Small Cars class. It also rates advanced (out of a possible not available, basic, advanced and superior) for crash avoidance and mitigation when equipped with the optional Pre-Collision System. The system provides forward collision warning and both low- and high-speed automatic emergency braking. Unfortunately, the Pre-Collision System requires three other packages: Premium Audio, Navigation and Luxury.\n\nA backup camera isn’t standard, but one is available as a stand-alone option as well as in packages.\n\nWith the Pre-Collision System comes adaptive cruise control, which works well but doesn’t operate down to a stop.\n\nOptional Lexus Enform Safety Connect adds automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle location, emergency assist button and Enhanced Roadside Assistance (a complimentary one-year trial subscription is included).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nAs I write this, the affordable Hyundai Ioniq was just certified with gas mileage higher than that of the Prius: 58 mpg combined. In this climate, it’s getting harder to accept ratings around 40 mpg, which once wowed us — especially if you pit the CT’s interior quality against more efficient hybrids’ higher trim levels, which compare in many respects despite not bearing luxury badges. The highest trim level of the larger Prius lists for $30,900, which is less than the Lexus CT200h’s $32,225. Full pricing wasn’t available as of publication, but the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq starts at $30,335.\n\nOur other comparison cars aren’t too far from the CT: The A3 e-tron is eligible for a federal tax credit of $4,502, which brings its starting price down to $35,348. The diesel engine puts the Jaguar XE at $37,395 — for a larger, more modern luxury car. Perhaps the most shocking is the Chevy Bolt EV’s $29,995 price after a $7,500 tax credit (should this incentive survive a Republican presidency). The Bolt EV has its limitations as a pure electric vehicle and requires some investment into a charging apparatus, but history has shown EVs to be very reliable and cheap to operate.\n\nKnowing that Lexus’ parent company is responsible for the 50-plus-mpg Prius, chances are good a more efficient CT is on its way, possibly as soon as the 2018 model year.",
