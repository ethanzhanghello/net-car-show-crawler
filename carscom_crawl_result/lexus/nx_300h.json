      "expert_review": "Lexus revolutionized the luxury SUV class with its mid-size crossover RX, which debuted for the 1999 model year. The Japanese luxury brand didn’t have a compact luxury SUV, however, until just a few years ago, when it launched the 2015 NX. The Lexus NX is offered as the NX 200t, with a turbocharged gas engine, and the NX 300h gas-electric hybrid. Because it has no direct hybrid competitors, the 300h competes against gas-only models like the Acura RDX, BMW X3 and Lincoln MKC. See their specs compared here.\n\nThe 2017 NX 300h is available only with all-wheel drive and has a starting price of $40,695, including a $975 destination charge. Optional features brought the as-tested price of the version we drove to $47,053.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLexus has restyled much of its lineup with a focus on sharp angles, creases and an imposing spindle grille. The design theme comes together well in the NX 300h; the grille doesn’t dominate the front end like it does on some other Lexus models.\n\nStandard Lexus NX 300h exterior features include 17-inch aluminum wheels, heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals, illuminated door handles, and LED headlights and daytime running lights.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the NX 300h is that its driving experience hasn’t been diminished for the sake of good gas mileage. It accelerates smoothly from a stop, even when the gas engine kicks in. Slowing down is similarly uneventful, as brake-pedal progression is linear and predictable. There’s not a ton of power in reserve for passing, but the drivetrain is strong enough in stop-and-go city driving.\n\nThat’s not to say that the SUV’s hybrid system goes completely unnoticed. The NX 300h makes a high-pitched whirring sound as you come to a stop, like some futuristic space vehicle powering down; this annoyed one editor. The way in which the NX 300h accelerates is a bit uncharacteristic, too, as engine rpm stays steady as the SUV builds speed. In this regard, it’s like the increasing number of cars on the market now with continuously variable automatic transmissions.\n\nThere’s a console dial for the SUV’s Normal, Sport and Eco drive modes, as well as an EV button that enables electric-only operation for short distances at low speeds. When Sport is selected, the gauge cluster’s hybrid system indicator switches to a familiar tachometer, and the gas pedal becomes more responsive. In Eco, conversely, gas pedal response is incredibly lethargic.\n\nRide quality is firm and the suspension manages most bumps well. On pockmarked city streets, however, the suspension transmits more imperfections to the cabin than we’d like. At highway speeds the NX 300h feels stable and settled, which reduces the amount of effort needed to keep it on its intended course.\n\nI was surprised by the amount of wind and tire noise in the cabin at highway speeds. Both are pronounced, transforming what luxury shoppers might expect to be a hushed space into a noisy environment.\n\nThe NX 300h’s 31 mpg rating in combined driving is significantly better than the EPA estimates for all-wheel-drive versions of the RDX (22 mpg), X3 (up to 24 mpg) and MKC (up to 22 mpg), as well as the gas-only NX 200t (24 mpg). I did a little better than the EPA’s combined estimate; I put about 90 miles on the NX 300h, driving it like I would any other test car, and averaged 35 mpg, according to the trip computer. My average speed was just 16 mph, reflecting a lot of urban and suburban driving, where this model is more efficient. Temperatures were mostly in the 40s. If you’re interested in more mileage data, one of our editors took the NX 300h on a road trip and diligently tracked its real-world fuel economy.\n\nInterior\n\nThe NX 300h’s aggressive exterior styling theme spills over to the cabin; the middle of the dashboard is dominated by an angular control panel that evokes the SUV’s grille.\n\nFit and finish are up to entry-luxury standards, and Lexus’ NuLuxe simulated leather upholstery (real leather is optional) does a very convincing impersonation of the real thing. Soft-touch surfaces on the upper part of the dashboard and doors are nice, but the silver trim on the center console can’t hide the fact that it’s painted plastic. The strip of imitation carbon fiber on the doors isn’t convincing, either, and many of the buttons, knobs and switches aren’t that different from what you’d find in a mainstream SUV from Toyota, Lexus’ parent company.\n\nThe Lexus NX 300h feels bigger inside than some compact luxury SUVs. The front seating position is comfortable and the seats have soft cushioning. The roomy second row features a comfortable reclining bench seat and generous legroom.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe luxury segment has fallen hard for multimedia systems controlled by a console interface instead of — or in addition to — a touchscreen. Lexus’ version is called Remote Touch. Unlike systems from Audi and BMW that use a rotary knob controller to navigate menus on a dashboard screen, Remote Touch uses a joystick-like controller or laptop-style trackpad, depending on the model, with no touchscreen functionality for the display. The NX has the trackpad when it’s equipped with the optional navigation system. Remote Touch isn’t a paragon of usability even with the joystick controller, and the trackpad makes it one of the most frustrating systems I’ve ever tested.\n\nTrackpads have their place, but a moving car isn’t one of them. Moving a finger around the NX’s trackpad makes the on-screen cursor jump from menu option to menu option, and it’s sometimes hard to choose the one you want even when the car is parked. When the car is moving and you’re being jostled while trying to pay attention to the road, forget about it.\n\nIn addition, the interface’s freeform nature makes it hard to operate by feel alone. Where in other systems a series of control-knob nudges will get you to the screen or menu you want, with Remote Touch you need to confirm every move with a quick look at the dashboard screen, which takes your eyes off the road. The trackpad incorporates haptic feedback — it pulses when you land on one of the on-screen buttons — but that can’t make up for the fact that this is the wrong kind of interface for a car.\n\nFortunately, there are secondary controls that let you avoid the trackpad for some functions. There’s a button to cycle through radio bands, as well as a knob to tune the station. Lexus also separated the climate controls entirely; all the climate system buttons are high on the dashboard, just below the screen.\n\nMy iPhone paired easily to the multimedia system using Bluetooth, and it was easy to play music stored on my phone once it was connected. The dashboard screen shows track info including artist artwork as well as playback controls. The Navigation Package includes Lexus’ Enform App Suite, with apps like Yelp and Pandora, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity aren’t currently available.\n\nThe multimedia system had one glitch during testing: I was listening to AM talk radio on the drive to Cars.com’s offices one morning, and when I tried to change audio sources the system was frozen. I couldn’t select a different radio band, change the station, adjust the volume or use the Remote Touch trackpad. I was stuck listening to the AM station until I stopped and turned the SUV off. When I turned it back on, the system operated normally again.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe NX 300h has 16.8 cubic feet of cargo space with the backseat up and 53.7 cubic feet when the standard 60/40-split backseat is folded flat with the cargo floor. There are storage areas in the doors and a decent-size storage bin under the front center armrest.\n\nSafety\n\nThe NX received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating in each of the agency’s crashworthiness tests, and its optional forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking received a rating of advanced (from possible scores of basic, advanced or superior when the feature is offered). The NX stands in good company within the IIHS’ mid-size luxury SUVs class. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the NX its highest, five-star overall rating for its crash-test performance and rollover resistance.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and optional active safety features other than the collision warning system include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nShoppers are flocking to SUVs of all sizes, and low gas prices are helping fuel the rush. That means one of the NX 300h’s strongest selling points — its fuel efficiency — doesn’t resonate as strongly as it might if gas prices were higher.\n\nYou pay a premium for the SUV’s hybrid technology, which makes it more expensive than competitors from Acura and Lincoln, but the NX 300h’s starting price still undercuts competition from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIf you place a premium on fuel efficiency — no matter the price of gas — the NX 300h is worth a look.",

In back, new taillights and a new rear bumper complete the look with longer L-shaped light elements and chrome-tipped exhaust pipes. It also gets a new 18-inch wheel design.\n\nInterior\n\n\nNot too much is new inside, and the biggest news is the new 10.3-inch display screen sitting atop the center control panel, replacing the smaller 7-inch model. It’s still a display only, however, with the controls for it on the center console. The remote touch interface pad is now larger for easier operation with a larger palm rest for better comfort. The climate control buttons also have been revised for easier use, and everything gets a new satin paint finish.\n\nIn back, the NX gets a foot-swipe-operated hatch to let you pop open the door while your arms are full.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nPowertrains carry over this year, with the base model NX300 (formerly called the NX200t) getting a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 235 horsepower in the 2017 trim, and Lexus did not mention any changes for 2018. An optional hybrid model, the NX300h, is available with a 154-hp gas-electric powertrain. The turbo gets a six-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid comes with a continuously variable unit. Front-wheel drive is standard on the NX300 with all-wheel drive an option; AWD is standard on the hybrid.\n\nLexus has updated the NX’s suspension with retuned springs, stabilizer bars and bushings for improved turn-in response and cornering behavior. The ride should be improved thanks to new shock absorbers, and a new adaptive variable suspension that uses tuning from the LC500 coupe is available.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAs before, the new NX comes standard with the Lexus Safety System Plus. That package includes a precollision system, dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert and automatic high beams.\n\nLook for the new NX in showrooms sometime later this year.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus NX?\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission; the NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60.\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lexus NX?\nModels built after Oct. 1, 2018, include Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Meanwhile, the subscription-based Lexus Enform Remote feature adds functionality, allowing users to access remote start and door lock features using a smart watch in addition to their smartphone.\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\nBesides standard Apple CarPlay for 2019, all NX trims include a host of electronic safety and convenience features, including a Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after initial trial), pedestrian detection with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high-beam headlights. The hybrid NX 300h has standard all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined – 6 mpg better than the front-drive NX 300.\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus NX?\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized and easy-to-handle package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad interface isn’t great to use, either.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nModels built after Oct. 1, 2019, include Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A power-adjustable steering wheel is also standard.\n\nA Black Line Special Edition of the NX 300 is also available. Limited to 2,000 copies, it features 18-inch bronze wheels, a black grille surround, black foglight housings and black mirror caps. Interior features include bronze accent stitching and a black headliner.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nBesides standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, all NX trims include a host of electronic safety and convenience features, including a Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after initial trial), automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. The hybrid NX 300h has standard all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined – 6 mpg better than the front-drive NX 300.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad interface isn’t great to use, either.",

      "expert_review": "As compact luxury SUVs go, the 2015 Lexus NX combines enough driving fun and occupant comfort to deserve a look, but anyone with serious cargo needs should look elsewhere, or stick to the brand’s popular RX.\n\nAs badge engineering goes, Toyota’s luxury division has more hits than misses. The ES midsize sedan feels considerably nicer than a Toyota Camry; the GX bears little resemblance inside or out to its Toyota 4Runner sibling. And so it goes for the NX, a car Lexus calls “loosely related to the RAV4,” Toyota’s popular small SUV. Still, Lexus insists the NX has 90 percent different parts and a structure that’s 20 percent more rigid.\n\nIndeed, the two seem like distant cousins, at most. The NX hits U.S. showrooms in December and pricing is still to come, but at a media preview in Seattle, I drove preproduction versions of the gasoline-powered NX 200t and the gas-electric NX 300h hybrid. My early take is that the NX holds promise.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen the NX broke press last April, we thought it would compete with the latest crowd of subcompact luxury SUVs — namely the BMW X1, Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. Lexus, however, insists the NX stacks up against those competitors’ larger X3/Q5/GLK siblings, a group that’s still a few inches shorter than the RX. The brand’s spindle grille draws similarities to the rest of the Lexus lineup, but the standard four-bar design combines with the NX’s thin lights and pinched nose to evoke an angry, rat-like expression. F Sport versions extend the grille lower, swap in a crisscrossing insert and finish out the bottom with a deeper, layered air dam. It’s unique — sinister, really — and you should get used to it. It’s what most F Sport models look like now, and I’ll take Vader over varmints any day.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard; 18s are optional. F Sport versions have 18s and P225/60R18 all-season tires or optional (and wider) 235/55R18 summer high-performance tires.\n\nHow It Drives\nRoughly the size of a Q5 or X3, the NX is still longer and wider than the original 1999 RX 300. In two generations since then, Lexus’ mainstay has grown; today’s RX 350 is 5.5 inches longer than the NX. It’s also more than 230 pounds heavier than Lexus’ new smallest SUV, whose lighter weight benefits drivability and efficiency. The NX 200t’s 235-horsepower, turbo four-cylinder speeds ahead with sufficient punch, and its six-speed automatic performs better than the RX’s clumsy transmission, holding lower gears and kicking down adeptly. Using Lexus’ familiar Drive Mode Select, the Eco and Normal modes introduce occasional gear-hunting in passing maneuvers, but Sport mode imbues the transmission with satisfying decisiveness.\n\nAll told, Lexus says the NX 200t hits 60 mph in the low 7-second range. That’s a hair slower than the competition’s base gasoline engines, but the expected fuel efficiency justifies it: Lexus pegs gas mileage at 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined in the front-drive NX 200t and 21/28/24 mpg with all-wheel drive. Final EPA figures are still pending, but if those figures pan out, the NX will impress in this class. One pesky detail: The NX 200t requires premium gas, something many competitors merely recommend.\n\nThe NX’s ride quality is busy at times, but it still feels more composed than the sometimes-choppy RX. I couldn’t detect a huge difference between the normal and F Sport suspensions; the latter have performance shocks and retuned springs, but most of our brief seat time in an NX 200t F Sport was over smooth pavement in moderate traffic.\n\nWe’ll have to put an F Sport through our handling loop around Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters to get a better sense of the ride/handling differences. In all trims, the steering feels a bit numb at low speeds; feedback improves as you speed up. Still, a non-F Sport 200t pitched hard into corners — a quick reminder that this is no sport sedan. The 200t’s all-wheel-drive system biases power up front, though it can split power 50/50 (front/rear) if needed. You can enforce the split with an all-wheel-drive lock switch on the dash. The 300h, meanwhile, gets a unique all-wheel-drive setup with separate motors for the front and rear axles.\n\nThe 194-hp NX 300h (which doesn’t come in an F Sport version) cedes more of the fun factor. There’s plenty of droning, rubber-band responsiveness from its continuously variable automatic transmission, along with a slow climb up the revs when you floor it; even at full bore, power feels adequate but never energetic, and the regenerative brakes have a degree of pedal vagueness that evokes earlier hybrids.\n\nIndeed, Lexus says zero to 60 mph takes a modest 9.1 seconds in the hybrid. It feels like that, but the payoff comes in impressive efficiency. Lexus estimates the NX 300h will get 32 to 33 mpg combined, depending on driveline — figures that trounce any immediate competitors, hybrid or diesel. What’s more, premium gas is only recommended, not required.\n\nInterior\nThe NX’s interior packs a lot of eye candy, mostly thanks to stitched, leatherlike synthetic materials that cover portions of the dashboard, center console and doors. Less convincing is the molded stitching that adorns upper sections — similar to the dash materials in the Camry and ES — as well as the big chunks of faux-metal plastic trim that flank the center controls. The layered approach does, however, look sharp overall.\n\nLexus’ standard NuLuxe upholstery helps, too. It’s fake leather, but it’s damn convincing. Real cowhide is optional, but you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference. Seat packaging is good: The reclining rear seats offer good legroom and a higher seating position than the backseat in the RX, which is too low to the floor. Still, taller adults may want more headroom; sitting upright, my 6-foot-tall frame brushed the ceiling. The optional power-folding rear seats work with one touch, and if something is in the way — say, a mischievous child trying to pancake his sibling — they stop and retract. You can work them from the backseat or cargo area, too; in the backseat, the hip-level buttons double as power recliners.\n\nCargo & Storage\nLexus says four golf bags fit behind the rear seats. If that’s the case, certain competitors must be able to fit the bags plus a caddy. The 2011-2014 X3, plus the Q5 and Acura RDX both have 25-plus cubic feet behind their rear seats, but the NX 200t has just 17.7 — a little more than the GLK’s undersized cargo area, but small for the class and less than half the cargo space of the RX. Fold the seats down, and the NX’s 54.6 cubic feet makes up some of the lost ground, falling near most competitors. (The NX 300h’s battery pack sits beneath the rear seat, cutting about 1 cubic foot of volume in either configuration.)\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI’m less enthralled about the brand’s next-gen Remote Touch interface, which comes on navigation-equipped NX models. The latest setup abandons a stubby joystick for a square surface that’s similar to a laptop touchpad. It’s straightforward and retains haptic feedback, but it suffers clunky map interactions and menu items that are too easy to miss. Pinch-to-zoom map functions operate with halting lag, and scrolling the map still takes too much hold-and-swipe dexterity. Sans navigation, the NX gets a simpler directional joystick knob.\n\nThe standard CD stereo has HD and AM/FM/satellite radio, Bluetooth audio streaming, Siri Eyes Free compatibility, USB/iPod connectivity and DVR-like real-time audio recording (AM/FM only, unfortunately). An optional wireless smartphone charger works through Qi, a wireless charging standard (much like Bluetooth is a wireless data-streaming standard). Navigation-equipped models add extra stereo speakers, including a subwoofer. They also add Lexus’ Enform system, which can stream apps ranging from Yelp to iHeartRadio off a compatible smartphone once you download the Enform app.\n\nSafety\nThe NX had not been crash-tested as of publication, but standard safety features include eight airbags, a backup camera and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Front parking sensors and blind spot, lane departure and forward collision warning systems are optional. The lane departure warning includes automatic steering correction, and the forward collision warning — packaged with all-speed adaptive cruise control — can automatically apply brakes if the driver misses its warnings.\n\nValue in Its Class\nLexus expects to sell about 36,000 NX SUVs in the U.S. annually — about a third of RX sales, but right in the thick of Q5/GLK/X3 numbers. And very few of those should come from RX shoppers; Lexus officials predict just 5 or 10 percent of sales will come at the expense of the brand’s mainstay SUV. Pricing information is due in fall 2014. The NX comes fairly well-equipped: eight-way power front seats with driver’s power lumbar; keyless access and push-button start; Bluetooth phone/audio with Siri Eyes Free integration; and that backup camera are all standard. The German competition starts just less than $40,000 (all prices include destination), but Acura’s 2015 RDX, at $35,790, is the value pick of the litter. We’ll see which direction Lexus goes. The NX can’t, however, start too close to the RX, which starts at less than $42,000 for 2015. With the right pricing, the brand’s latest SUV deserves attention.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on the NX 300, while the NX 300h is only available with all-wheel drive. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard, along with power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nDual-zone climate control\nPower-adjustable steering wheel\n8-inch multimedia screen\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity \nWi-Fi hot spot with free trial \nAutomatic emergency braking \nAdaptive cruise control \nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPower moonroof\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation with 10.3-inch screen\nMark Levinson premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad multimedia interface isn’t great to use, either.",
