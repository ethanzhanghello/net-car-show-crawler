      "expert_review": "A few months ago, Lexus announced a round of updates to its electric RZ SUV for the 2026 model year. Now that details on its Toyota (bZ — nee bZ4X — and bZ Woodland) and Subaru (Solterra and Trailseeker) cousins have dropped, Lexus has a few more bits of information to share on the refreshed RZ.\n\nRelated: Updated 2026 Lexus RZ Debuts With New 402-HP RZ 550e F Sport\n\nWe already knew the 2026 RZ would be more powerful than the 2025 model, with the front-wheel-drive version’s output growing from 201 horsepower to 221. Now, we also know that the base model will earn an alphanumeric promotion as a result; previously known as the RZ 300e, it now goes by RZ 350e. Oddly, the all-wheel-drive RZ 450e’s final total output lands at 308 hp, 30 less than its bZ and Solterra counterparts. Lexus says the RZ 300e should accelerate from 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds, with the RZ 450e needing 4.9 seconds. The 402-hp RZ 550e F Sport will get there in 4.1.\n\nBattery Specs and Range\n\nLexus has also confirmed that the RZ’s updated battery pack stores the same 74.7 kilowatt-hours of energy as the ones in its platform-mates. The brand has yet to announce final range ratings, though, saying only that the RZ 300e will be good for about 300 miles, while the RZ 450e will have a range of 260 miles. Another surprise is that the RZ 550e F Sport will get a slightly larger 77-kWh battery, which it will drain in about 225 miles.\n\nAs wheel size can have a significant impact on electric-vehicle range, those estimates are for the smallest available wheels. Eighteens are standard on the RZ 350e and RZ 450e, with 20-inch wheels available, and 20s are standard on the F Sport. A North American Charging Standard port will allow the 2026 RZ to juice up at Tesla charging stations, and a more powerful onboard charger means the electric SUV can replenish its pack from 10% to 80% in approximately 30 minutes.\n\nHow Big Is the 2026 Lexus RZ?\n\nIn the absence of complete specifications and dimensions for all of the vehicles in the updated EV family, the biggest question about the 2026 RZ might be which pair of vehicles it is most closely related to. The 2025 RZ is already a fair bit longer than the bZ4X and Solterra, and the 2026 model measures nearly the same 189.2 inches as the 2025 model. The 2026 bZ and 2025 Solterra both measure 184.6 inches long. Subaru has not released the dimensions of the Trailseeker, but Toyota says the Woodland — which appears to be nearly identical — is “nearly 6 inches” longer than the regular bZ, so at least 190 inches long.\n\nMore Interior Updates\n\nLexus is also taking this opportunity to upgrade the RZ’s interior. In addition to the previously announced steer-by-wire system (though minus the steering yoke), the 2026 model features an improved electrochromic panoramic glass roof. Better performance at both ends of its variable-opacity spectrum means it tints deeper when occupants want a shady interior and is clearer when they want to let the light in. A newly available synthetic suede door trim features laser-etched patterns that, in tandem with changing ambient lighting, create shadows that slowly change over the course of a long drive.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nAmidst these details, there is nothing new to report about the 2026 Lexus RZ’s arrival and pricing. Lexus is still saying only that it will go on sale later in 2025 and that pricing will be announced closer to launch.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Lexus RZ 450e Review: Delightful in (Almost) All the Right Places\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nToyota Joins Ionna Charging Network Joint Venture\nToyota Next Automaker to Get Tesla Supercharger Access\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Lexus RZ 450e SUV is comfortable, refined, and full of tech and cabin innovations that help it stand out in an increasingly crowded electrified market.\n\nVersus the competition: With little-to-none of the quirkiness that often plagues other electric vehicles, the RZ deftly balances innovation and comfort when it comes to its driving experience and usability — but less range than key competitors is a problem.\n\nThe new RZ is Lexus’ first electric vehicle, though parent company Toyota has a long history of electrification. Toyota was an early hybrid pioneer with the Prius, and Lexus followed suit with a variety of hybrids along with a growing portfolio of plug-in hybrids.\n\nThe 2023 RZ 450e comes on the heels of Toyota’s own EV, the 2023 bZ4X. The RZ shares the bZ4X’s platform but has a different motor setup, vastly different styling and is larger overall. See them compared.\n\nRelated: All-Electric 2023 Lexus RZ: Overachieving on Space, But Not Range\n\nIn size, the RZ slots between the NX and RX SUVs in the automaker’s lineup and competes in a growing segment of luxury EVs against the likes of the Audi E-Tron, Tesla Model Y and Volvo XC40 Recharge. See these models compared.\n\nZippy Power, Smooth Ride\n\nIf you’re used to the RX, the RZ will feel like a more modern and dynamic relative — in all the best ways; it’s quick, composed and comfortable. It’s available in Premium and Luxury trims with standard all-wheel drive. Power comes from two electric motors that make a combined 308 horsepower, and the RZ has a 71.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack.\n\nMeanwhile, its bZ4X relative comes standard with front-wheel drive and combines a single motor and the 71.4-kWh lithium-ion battery pack for a much more modest 201 hp. Selecting the AWD bZ4X gets you two motors that make 214 hp total and a 72.8-kWh battery.\n\nI tested the RZ in Premium trim with 18-inch wheels and found it a joy to drive. Power delivery is immediate and smooth from a stop, and the RZ exhibits an athleticism you wouldn’t expect from an SUV this size. It’s agile around corners and has a direct, connected steering feel that adds to its overall controlled, composed character.\n\nFor extra sportiness, Lexus plans to offer a steer-by-wire system equipped with a steering yoke in place of a traditional steering wheel. Instead of a mechanical connection to the vehicle’s wheels, like regular steering systems have, the steer-by-wire system uses electronics to control the front wheels. I sampled this forthcoming model, and it delivered an odd combination of more precise steering with less feedback for a surreal, video-game-like experience. It’s coming to the lineup at a later date, but Lexus has not yet said when or how much it will cost.\n\nThe RZ also comes with larger 20-inch wheels and tires, but these should be avoided. With the 18-inch wheels and tires, the ride is serene with ample isolation from bumps. The 20s feel rowdier, however, and translate too much of the road through the body, making for a much more unsettled ride.\n\nThe RZ delivers braking smoothness, too. Like other EVs, it has a regenerative braking system that helps capture kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost — but I could barely tell. Unlike some other EVs’ brake systems that have a nonlinear action and lurchy quality, the RZ’s brakes were smooth and naturally reactive. Unfortunately there’s no one-pedal operation that allows the accelerator pedal to control both forward speed and braking, depending on its position, which is a handy feature I like in traffic. The braking system is adjustable, however; you can dial up the strength of the regen system using the paddle shifters.\n\nAdjusting the regen brakes to the strongest setting captures the most energy, which will likely help with overall driving range. Amplifying range is a good idea, as it’s one of consumers’ biggest worries when it comes to EVs, and the RZ could use every extra mile it can get.\n\nOn models with the 18-inch wheels, Lexus says the RZ has an estimated 220 miles of  range; that dips to 196 miles on versions with the 20s. Its range falls short of competitors: the E-Tron is estimated at 226 miles of range, the base Model Y has an EPA-estimated 330 miles of range, and the XC40 Recharge gets an estimated 223 miles. It also falls a bit short of the AWD bZ4X’s EPA-estimated range of 222 to 228 miles.\n\nIt lags in terms of its Level 2 charging rate, too, which matters for home and lower-power public charging. The RZ’s onboard charger is rated at 6.6 kilowatts, which is on the low side and means a full charge from empty using a Level 2 charger would take about 9.5 hours, according to Lexus. The Model Y, by comparison, has an 11.5-kW onboard charger.  Lexus says the RZ’s peak charging speed at public DC fast chargers is 150 kW and that it can be charged from 0%-80% in approximately 30 minutes.\n\nLuxury Meets Minimalism in the Cabin\n\nLexus is attempting to redefine luxury with a new take on cabin materials and design, and I’m sold. The RZ’s interior is lovely; everything feels well put together, and the look and feel is minimalist but not boring. The overall effect is a space that’s airy, modern and classy.\n\nLeather is not available, instead replaced by simulated suede made with sustainable materials that looks and feels every bit as luxurious as the real deal. Instead of the wood or metal paneling you see in traditional luxury vehicles, the RZ uses light as a trim element — a clever take on sustainability. Called Shadow Illumination, the system projects light and patterns onto the front door panels. It was difficult to see in the daytime, however.\n\nAiding the cabin’s open, airy feel is a standard panoramic glass roof. While it doesn’t have a screen to cover it, which Lexus said saves weight and lessens the impact on headroom, it’s available with a neat dimming function that reduces the amount of light entering the cabin with the push of a button, taking it from clear to opaque in an instant.\n\nThe streamlined dash is highlighted by a standard 14-inch touchscreen infotainment system, similar to the system in the NX. A digital instrument cluster as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard; I found the system worked seamlessly with my Android phone, connecting quickly and resuming previous apps each time I engaged it. The system’s new voice command function, enabled by saying “Hey Lexus,” also worked accurately for audio and climate functions.\n\nOther standard creature comforts include a wireless charger, heated steering wheel, and heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nTwo minor annoyances marred an otherwise straightforward control experience. First, the RZ’s shifter is a console dial. While its placement is comfortable, its action is odd and tripped me up every time. It requires a push down then a sideways toggle to change gears.\n\nSecond, while I found the infotainment screen easy to navigate — and definitely ahead of Tesla’s and Volvo’s systems in terms of ease of use — one issue continued to annoy: It was difficult to get out of the Android Auto interface and back to the vehicle’s native audio controls. For example, if you’re listening to satellite radio and wondering “Who sings this song?” you need to go into the apps menu and select the Lexus icon to get back to the radio screen. In other vehicles, a home button or something similar on the main screen makes this transition easier. It’s not a deal breaker but an odd extra step.\n\nNo Cheap Seats\n\nIn front, headroom was plentiful for my 5-foot-6-inch self, and I had oodles of legroom. Available on the RZ is a new radiant heat system for the driver and front passenger that impacts space — in good and bad ways. A heated metal panel encased in mesh near the driver’s and front passenger’s knee areas gently warms the cabin, augmenting the car’s traditional fan-based climate control.\n\nThere are upsides and downsides to this setup. Lexus says it provides warmth at a reduced rate of battery consumption, which helps conserve energy and range. Also, one of the panels sits where the glove box would be, opening up that space for more legroom. However, that means there’s less small items storage space in the cabin. There’s no glove box — even on models that don’t have the heating feature — which I’d miss if I owned one. Instead, there’s a medium-size space under the shifter to store stuff, as well as a more enclosed console-area storage box.\n\nIn back, there’s room for three and again, legroom and headroom are generous, and the seat is comfortable and supportive. For those with kids in car seats, the two sets of lower anchors are exposed for struggle-free connection, though the three top tether anchors on the seatback are buried in the carpet, complicating access and connection. Cargo space is also ample, and the RZ’s low load floor and wide opening make loading easy.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nStandard on the RZ is the latest version of the Lexus Safety System+ 3.0, which includes features such as automatic emergency braking with oncoming traffic detection, adaptive cruise control with curve speed management and hands-on lane-centering down to a stop.\n\nOptional features include an advanced park system with perpendicular and parallel parking functions and the hands-free Traffic Jam Assist feature for low-speed driving on limited-access highways.\n\nThe 2023 Lexus RZ 450e starts at $59,650 (all prices include the destination charge) — well above the 2023 bZ4X’s $43,335 starting price, but in line with luxury competitors. The E-Tron starts much higher at $71,995, while the Model Y ($56,380) and XC40 Recharge ($54,645) are a bit lower.\n\nIts price stings a bit more because the RZ is not eligible for the federal $7,500 tax credit and likely won’t be because it is made in Japan. In the recently overhauled tax credit program, there’s a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. The Model Y is manufactured in the U.S. and is thus eligible — for now.\n\nOn paper, the Model Y just looks like it makes more sense, right? It delivers more range for less money, but it’s just not as likable: a firm ride, chintzy feeling cabin and confounding controls make it one of my least favorite EVs. Meanwhile, the RZ 450e delights in (almost) all the right places. Lexus has a big goal of zero emissions from its vehicles by 2035, and its first EV signals the future is bright for further offerings — it just needs to work on the range part.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated May 15, 2023, to reflect that the 2023 Toyota bZ4X is not Toyota’s first EV.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nElectric Lex, Electric Luxe: 2023 Lexus RZ 450e Starts at $59,650\nAll-Electric 2023 Lexus RZ: Overachieving on Space, But Not Range\nLexus to Offer Home EV Chargers for 2023 RZ 450e With ChargePoint, Qmerit\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2023?\nHow Much Do Electric Car Charging Stations Cost?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nDebuting for 2023 as the first all-electric Lexus, the RZ is a luxury SUV that slots between the brand’s compact NX and mid-size RX SUVs in terms of size. The RZ shares a basic platform with the Toyota bZ4X and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The front-drive RZ 300e is new for 2024, and it has a single motor making 201 horsepower; it can go up to 266 miles on a full charge, per the EPA, although upgrading from the standard 18-inch wheels to the available 20-inch wheels drops that figure to just 224 miles. The AWD RZ 450e adds a second motor on the rear axle that bumps total output to 310 hp; it drops the driving range to 220 miles with the standard wheels and just 196 miles on the 20s. The RZ’s rivals include the Audi Q4 e-Tron, Cadillac Lyriq and Genesis GV60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nIn addition to the new front-drive RZ 300e model, which drops the RZ’s starting price by almost $5,000, a dual-voltage charging cable is now standard on all RZs. It enables charging on both 120- and 240-volt outlets.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Lexus RZ Have?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 196-266 miles depending on trim and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s charging times range from an estimated 9.5 hours on a standard 240V Level 2 charger to go to a 100% charge, down to an estimated 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger to go from a 10% charge to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus RZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nSynthetic leather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch wheels\nSynthetic suede upholstery\nHeated outboard rear seats\nFront-seat foot-and-leg radiant heater\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n13-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nLane change assist\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAutomated steering while parking\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nMost new electric vehicles introduced in the last few years have significantly greater range than the RZ — and some even double it. Its slow charging speed means you get the worst of both worlds: The battery drains quickly, and it takes a long time to recharge. For the money, there are plenty of choices with superior range. If you’re just looking for a daily-use EV for a commute and its short leash doesn’t bother you, the RZ is a luxurious and comfortable way to motor silently around.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nDebuting for 2023 as the first all-electric Lexus, the RZ is a luxury SUV that, in terms of size, slots between the brand’s compact NX and mid-size RX SUVs. The RZ shares a basic platform with the Toyota bZ4X and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The front-drive RZ 300e has a single motor making 201 horsepower; it can travel an EPA-rated 266 miles on a full charge, but upgrading from the standard 18-inch wheels to available 20-inch wheels drops that estimate to just 224 miles. The AWD RZ 450e adds a second motor on the rear axle that bumps total output to 310 hp; it drops the driving range to 220 miles with the standard wheels and just 196 miles with the 20s. The RZ’s rivals include the Audi Q4 e-Tron, Cadillac Lyriq and Optiq, and Genesis GV60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe RZ 300e and RZ 450e both add an entry-level trim for 2025 that slots below the existing Premium and Luxury trims; those new base models start $4,200 less than their Premium counterparts. Lexus has also lowered the prices of the Premium and Luxury by $7,000 this year. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Lexus RZ Have?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 196-266 miles depending on trim and wheel size. \n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s charging times range from an estimated 9.5 hours on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger to go to a 100% charge, down to an estimated 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger to go from a 10% charge to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-zone climate control\nSynthetic leather seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\n20-inch wheels\nSynthetic suede upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated outboard rear seats\nFront-seat foot-and-leg radiant heater\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n13-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nLane departure steering assist\nFront cross-traffic alert\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomated steering while parking\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nMost new electric vehicles introduced in the last few years have significantly greater range than the RZ (and some even double it). Its slow charging speed means you get the worst of both worlds: The battery drains quickly, and it takes a long time to recharge. For similar money, there are plenty of choices with superior range, but if you’re just looking for a daily-use EV for a commute and its short leash doesn’t bother you, the RZ is a luxurious and comfortable way to motor silently around — and substantial price cuts for 2025 make it that much more compelling.",
