      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat IS 250 sedan and four-seat IS 250C convertible are Lexus’ sporty rivals to the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on the sedan. Competitors include the BMW 128i and 328i, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C300. The more powerful IS 350 plays against beefier versions of those same cars.\n\nThe IS 250 and 250C come with a 2.5-liter V-6; the IS 350 and its 3.5-liter V-6 are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section, as is the V-8-powered IS-F.\n\n(Skip to details on the: IS 250C)\nNew for 2013\nThe IS 250 is no longer offered with a manual transmission, leaving just the six-speed automatic.\n\nA new Special Edition sedan that hits dealerships November 2012 features 17-inch wheels, F Sport front-end styling and two-tone leather upholstery.\n \nThe available navigation system features the latest version of Lexus Enform communication system and App Suite smartphone-appplication integration. The convertible is available with a red leather interior and an optional F Sport Package includes 18-inch wheels, a front lip spoiler, a sport suspension, and heated and ventilated front seats.\nExterior\nLexus’ LF-series concept cars influenced the IS 250’s styling. A long wheelbase and wide stance help give the IS 250 a muscular look.\n\nAn optional F Sport Package for the sedan includes a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels, and front and rear spoilers. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 18-inch alloy wheels \nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights \nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional backup camera, front and rear parking sensors\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the IS 250 sedan, though the backseat is tight. Bright electroluminescent instruments light up the dashboard. Black metallic trim is standard.\n\nThe optional navigation system’s voice-recognition software picks up casual-language commands, and the standard stereo has a USB port to better integrate iPods or other MP3 players. Lexus’ Enform service, included with the navigation system, can assist in finding street addresses, restaurants and more. It comes with a year of free service; after that, you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. Interior features include:\n\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower moonroof \nManual tilt/telescoping steering wheel (power version optional)\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nA six-speed automatic transmission is standard in the IS 250. The automatic’s steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters give the driver extra involvement when desired. Lexus says the rear-wheel-drive sedan can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n204-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 with 185 pounds-feet of torque\nDouble-wishbone front suspension \nMultilink rear suspension \nAll-wheel-drive models send 70 percent of power to the rear wheels by default; they can automatically route power 50/50 (front/rear) on low-traction surfaces like snow or ice\n\nSafety\nLexus’ Safety Connect service, which automatically notifies authorities in the event of a crash, is standard. Like Enform, a year’s service is included, but after that you’ll have to pay a subscription. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system \nVehicle Dynamic Integrated Management, which is meant to integrate all systems to anticipate skids and react faster than an electronic stability system alone \nKnee airbags for both front occupants \nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\n\n\nIS 250C\nThe IS 250C convertible has a retractable hardtop that Lexus says can operate in just 21 seconds. The four-seat interior features anti-glare gauges, plus audio and climate systems that automatically adjust their settings to compensate for top-down noise and temperatures. Other safety and luxury features remain similar to those on the IS 250 sedan. However, the IS 250C convertible is not available with all-wheel drive. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "I was enjoying the top-down comfort of the Lexus IS 250C when dark skies suddenly threatened rain. In just a few seconds, the retractable hardtop was in place and I was snug inside a cabin that is as tight and solid as a coupe.\n\nThat’s the beauty of a retractable hardtop. It makes convertible life easy. Putting the top up and down happens at the flick of a switch. When Lexus decided to build a convertible version of its luxury compact, it charged Junichi Furuyama, chief engineer, with the task of designing a top that was quiet, smooth and precise.\n\nFuruyama’s team created an electric mechanism rather than the more conventional hydraulic system. The four-link roof assembly, made of aluminum, opens and closes quickly, yet it cleverly slows down as it nears the end of its movement so that it finishes gently. It’s a subtle touch but one you appreciate after opening and closing the top several times a day.\n\nThe IS 250C competes with the Infiniti G37 and BMW 3-series. The Lexus feels smaller and more compact than the Infiniti, and it is oriented more toward comfort than outright performance.\n\nThe IS 250C comes with a 2.5-liter V-6, and the IS 350C has a 3.5-liter V-6. The smaller engine delivers 204 horsepower while the larger one puts out 306 horsepower. The IS 250C can be equipped with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. The IS 350C is offered only with the automatic.\n\nThe test car had the smaller engine, and its performance was more than adequate.\n\nRear-wheel drive provides a sportier balance and better handling than front-wheel drive, but it is not as capable in snow in spite of the fact that anti-lock brakes, traction control and vehicle stability control are standard. It’s too bad that all-wheel drive is not an option like it is on the IS sedan.\n\nEach engine has direct fuel injection. The 3.5-liter one also has supplemental port fuel injectors that are activated at low to medium speeds.\n\nPrices begin at $38,940 for the IS 250C with manual transmission, $40,110 for the automatic and $44,390 for the IS 350C.\n\nCabin comfort is a prime consideration for a convertible, particularly when the top is down. The Lexus has very little wind buffeting, aided in part by its low 0.29 coefficient of drag. Panels under the engine, floor and fuel tank smooth airflow under the car. Small fairings in front of the tires cut turbulence, too.\n\nMany convertibles shake and shimmy a bit when the top is down, but the Lexus was quite solid, thanks to extra bracing under the car.\n\nThe front seats were shaped to provide good comfort without making it hard to get in and out. The rear seat is rather narrow, and rear-seat leg-room is very tight.\n\nDual-zone air conditioning is standard. The test car was equipped with a navigation system and the Mark Levinson upgraded stereo. The sound was excellent. There is a USB port for an MP3 player.\n\nBecause personalization is such a popular part of this segment, Lexus offers a number of F-Sport accessories for the IS C, such as upgraded front and rear brakes, 18-inch or 19-inch forged alloy wheels, sway bars, sport shocks and lower springs. Buyers can also choose a performance exhaust system, a performance clutch, a different shift knob and floor mats.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car had a base price of $40,110. Options included 18-inch, graphite-colored wheels; bi-xenon headlights; heated and cooled front seats; a navigation system; and the Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo. The sticker price was $48,200.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles, with a six-year, 70,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2010 Lexus IS 250C\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter, 204-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 107.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,814 lbs.\n\nBase price: $40,110\n\nAs driven: $48,200\n\nMPG rating: 21 city, 29 hwy.\n\nTo contact Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "For more than 10 years, Lexus has presented luxury shoppers an unlikely offering in the IS, a rear-wheel-drive sport sedan from a brand best known for cushy comfort. The gamble worked: The IS drives better than most of its Lexus siblings. It does not, however, get there without a penalty.\n\nWhile the Lexus IS sedan performs well, it makes drivers give up ride comfort and roominess in ways that its competitors don’t.\n\nLexus restyled a few elements on the IS for 2011, which you can compare with the 2010 model here. The car comes in IS 250 or IS 350 form, representing the size of each one’s V-6 engine. Both are also available as a convertible, denoted by “C” in the model name. Compare them here. The lineup’s high-performance IS-F sedan is covered separately on Cars.com. All-wheel drive is optional on the IS 250 and 350 sedans; in previous years, it was optional only on the IS 250.\n\nWe evaluated two cars: a rear-wheel-drive IS 250C convertible and an all-wheel-drive IS 350 sedan.\n\nQuick, or Not So Much\nEven carrying an extra 176 pounds of driveline, the all-wheel-drive IS 350 moves out. Lexus’ direct-injection V-6 feels on par with the powerhouse six-cylinders in the BMW 335i and Infiniti G37. It pulls strongly, sounds muscular and can generally overtake slower traffic whenever your right foot desires. Aided by a quick-shifting six-speed automatic, the 306-horsepower IS 350 is a confident beast. One editor thought the automatic shifted a bit harshly sometimes, but most agreed it’s a responsive gearbox — not the usual pedigree from parent company Toyota. Still, I wish the IS 350 had a manual transmission. Most competing sedans offer one with their larger engines. Manuals might not sell well, but having one available would make the IS more attractive to performance enthusiasts.\n\nThe 204-hp IS 250 does offer a stick, and you’ll probably need it to wring the most out of the engine. Our test car’s pint-sized V-6 felt two cylinders short. It reminded me of a Mercedes-Benz C240 — the cheapest six-cylinder Mercedes of its time, discontinued in 2006. Like the old Benz, the IS 250’s oomph from a stop is modest, though it’s better in the drivetrain’s Power mode — activated by a dashboard switch — which noticeably hastens accelerator and transmission response (at some cost to fuel efficiency). With three people inside, our convertible needed the drivetrain’s full reserves to reach highway speed.\n\nLexus quotes a zero-to-60 time of 8.4 seconds for the 250 convertible, which is pokey for a luxury car. Weighing 375 pounds less, the rear-drive IS 250 sedan hits the mark in 7.9 seconds, Lexus says. (Incidentally, that’s not far off the C240, which hit the mark in about 8.2 seconds.) Among today’s entry-level sport sedans, the BMW 328i is quicker, and the turbocharged Audi A4 beats both. Lexus has some catching up to do.\n\nRide & Handling\nAs a group, sport sedans ride firmly, but the IS sedan takes things to an extreme that could turn off many shoppers. Wearing 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires, our IS 350 sedan picked up all sorts of bumps, from slight expansion joints to sizable potholes. Our editors agreed it’s uncomfortable, and that’s a sacrifice you don’t necessarily have to make. The 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class ride decidedly better. Believe it or not, you could probably get the IS to ride even worse: Options include 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, as well as a performance-tuned F-Sport suspension.\n\nThanks to distinct suspension tuning, the convertible rides blessedly softer. Our IS 250C, which had the same 17-inch wheels, isolated road imperfections the sedan played up harshly. On the flip side, it didn’t have the most rigid structure. With the top down, the windshield frame shuddered a bit over broken pavement, but that’s a common characteristic in four-seat convertibles.\n\nSome may want more power steering assist at low speeds, in the vein of the A4 or C-Class, but the IS exhibits better feedback than either of those cars. The nose pushes a bit at first when barreling into sweeping curves, but the car settles on its rear nicely on the way out, proving nearly as drift-happy as a 3 Series or G37. My only gripe involves body roll, which was noticeable in both our cars.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin’s businesslike tones and low-gloss textures are typical Lexus traits, but our test cars’ faux metal trim and rubberized dash contours drew criticism. The door and center armrests felt short on padding. The A4 and G have better cabins, and just about every competitor is roomier. The IS’ cramped dimensions are apparent no matter where you’re sitting. Two editors bemoaned tight headroom in the sedan, and several noted the cabin’s narrowness, in part due to a wide center console that encroaches on hip and knee room.\n\nThe power-adjustable front seats are supportive and generally comfortable, and their long adjustment range should accommodate adults up to the low-6-foot range — backseat space be damned. And damned it is; legroom is as miserable there as in the 3 Series sedan, and headroom is tenable only because the seat sits low to the floor. Adults’ knees will either be raised in the air or digging into the front seatbacks, or both. Indeed, with 86 cubic feet of cabin volume, the IS sedan is among the smallest cars in its class. By the EPA’s standards, it’s a subcompact car. Similar money can get you a car one or two sizes larger, in the G37 or A4, and the Acura TL is even roomier. It’s 2011, and a sport sedan need not be this cramped.\n\nLexus offers the usual gamut of luxury options, from heated and ventilated front seats to a power rear sunshade. The optional Mark Levinson stereo, however, is worth skipping. We don’t often get deep into audiophile territory, but three editors remarked on their strong lack of love for the Levinson. No matter our adjustments, the treble was crashy and distorted, and the bass was a muddled mess. In a league with such aural standouts as the TL’s ELS stereo or the A4’s Bang & Olufsen system, Lexus disappoints.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the IS sedan earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side impacts. However, rear and roof-strength ratings were just Acceptable — one rung down from Good. It’s important to note these scores don’t translate to the IS convertible, which hasn’t been tested. Standard features include chest and knee airbags, plus seat-mounted side-impact airbags and two-row side curtain airbags in the sedan. The IS convertible has no curtain airbags, but its side-impact airbags include head extensions. Click here for a full list of features. On automatic convertibles, a collision warning system comes with the optional adaptive cruise control.\n\nReliability for the IS sedan has been good, but the convertible has performed below average. The stick-shift IS 250 starts at $33,295. That’s not bad given its generous list of standard features: an iPod/USB-compatible stereo, eight-way power front seats with power lumbar, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof and leather upholstery. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, a power rear sunshade, a navigation system, the Mark Levinson audio system and a backup camera. The IS 350 starts at $39,720 but comes standard with the automatic transmission. So do all-wheel-drive variants, which add $2,460 to $3,630 to the price tag, depending on the engine. Load up an all-wheel-drive IS 350, and the price nears $50,000. The IS convertible tops out near $57,000.\n\nIS in the Market\nThe IS has never put much of a dent in 3 Series sales. It’s been as popular as Audi’s A4 and S4, which are distant second-tier players in the heady entry-level luxury class. Lexus, however, looks to be on the verge of a product renaissance, in the vein of what happened to the brand mid-decade. Here’s hoping the IS’ coming makeover solves its practical issues — but doesn’t water down what’s good.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat IS 250 sedan and four-seat IS 250C convertible are Lexus’ sporty rivals to the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on the sedan. Competitors include the BMW 128i and 328i, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C300. The more powerful IS 350 plays against beefier versions of those same cars.\n\nThe IS 250 and 250C come with a 2.5-liter V-6; the IS 350 and its 3.5-liter V-6 are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section, as is the V-8-powered IS-F.\n\n(Skip to details on the: IS 250C)\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for 2012.\nExterior\nLexus’ LF-series concept cars influenced the IS 250’s styling. A long wheelbase and wide stance help give the IS 250 a muscular look.\n\nAn optional F Sport Package for the sedan includes a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels and front and rear spoilers. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional backup camera, front and rear parking sensors\n\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the IS 250 sedan, though the backseat is tight. Bright electroluminescent instruments light up the dashboard. Black metallic trim is standard.\n\nThe optional navigation system’s voice-recognition software picks up casual-language commands, and the standard stereo has a USB port to better integrate iPods or other MP3 players. Lexus’ Enform service, included with the navigation system, can assist in finding street addresses, restaurants and more. It comes with a year of free service; after that, you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. Interior features include:\n\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower moonroof\nManual tilt/telescoping steering wheel (power version optional)\n13-speaker stereo\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard in the IS 250, and a six-speed automatic is optional. The automatic’s steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters give the driver extra involvement when desired. Lexus says the rear-wheel-drive sedan can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. The automatic is the only transmission offered on all-wheel-drive models. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n204-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 with 185 pounds-feet of torque\nDouble-wishbone front suspension\nMultilink rear suspension\nAll-wheel-drive models send 70 percent of power to the rear wheels by default; they can automatically route power 50/50 (front/rear) on low-traction surfaces like snow or ice\n\n\nSafety\nLexus’ Safety Connect service, which automatically notifies authorities in the event of a crash, is standard. Like Enform, a year’s service is included, but after that you’ll have to pay a subscription. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nVehicle Dynamic Integrated Management, which is meant to integrate all systems to anticipate skids and react faster than an electronic stability system alone\nKnee airbags for both front occupants\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\n\n\nIS 250C\nThe IS 250C convertible has a retractable hardtop that Lexus says can operate in just 21 seconds. The four-seat interior features anti-glare gauges, plus audio and climate systems that automatically adjust their settings to compensate for top-down noise and temperatures. Other safety and luxury features remain similar to those on the IS 250 sedan. However, the IS 250C convertible is not available with all-wheel drive. Back to top",
