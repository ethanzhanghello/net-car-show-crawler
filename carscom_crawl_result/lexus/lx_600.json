      "expert_review": "As a highly capable off-roader with a nearly six-figure starting price, the Lexus LX 600 has long courted an unclear demographic. Who, exactly, is bashing rocks in a leather-lined full-size SUV? Things just get weirder for the 2025 model year with the launch of the LX 700h, a highly capable off-roader with a hybrid powertrain and a starting price even nearer to — if not beyond — six figures.\n\nRelated: Is the Redesigned 2022 Lexus LX 600 a Good Luxury SUV? 4 Things We Like, 4 We Don’t\n\n700 Club\n\nThe twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V-6 hybrid powertrain is familiar from the Toyota Tundra and Sequoia, where it goes by the i-Force Max branding (Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand). But in the LX 700h, total system output sneaks upward to 457 horsepower and 583 pounds-feet of torque, the former up 20 hp. Coupled with a 10-speed automatic transmission like the LX 600 employs, the powertrain is good for a claimed 20 mpg combined, a 1-mpg improvement over the gas-only LX, according to Toyota (official EPA ratings are not yet available).\n\nThe LX 600 continues on with its twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6, which puts out 409 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque, but Lexus didn’t just plug in some batteries to make the 700h and call it a day. The LX hybrid’s frame is modified to make room for the battery without compromising the SUV’s departure angle.\n\nNot only is the LX 700h’s powertrain designed so that the electric motor can power the wheels alone in low range — allowing for precise power delivery in precarious situations — but Lexus is prepared to assuage the concerns of any buyers concerned about the complicated powertrain’s durability in the backcountry. This is the brand’s first hybrid with a regular starter and alternator as standard, ensuring the engine remains operational in case of hybrid system failure.\n\nOver Hill and Dale, Overtrail\n\nAll LXs have a standard locking center differential, height-adjustable adaptive suspension, 360-degree camera system with an off-road mode to help drivers spot obstacles and place their rig’s wheels, and five-setting crawl control (a sort of low-speed, off-road cruise control).\n\nStill, Lexus seems particularly intent on sending the LX 700h off-road, as the new Overtrail trim level is only available with the hybrid powertrain. The Overtrail adds locking front and rear differentials, as well as a front skid plate and 33-inch all-terrain tires on 18-inch rims. The requisite appearance upgrades include a matte-gray grille, dark-chrome exterior trim, black fender accents, and black and brown upholstery. For buyers who prefer their 6-foot-tall, roughly 6,000-pound SUV cater more toward on-road performance, the F Sport Handling — with its unique damper tune, limited-slip rear differential and 22-inch wheels — is still available.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Lexus LX 600 and LX 700h will go on sale in early 2025; pricing will be announced closer to the start of sales.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus LX 600 Review: A Flagship Needs to Be Better\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\n2022 Lexus LX 600 Ultra Luxury: Families Beware\nResearch the Lexus LX 600\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Flashy to the point of gaudiness, expensive but flimsy-feeling, big outside but not inside, Lexus’ flagship SUV drives well but is disappointing overall.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors from BMW, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz are more luxurious and higher-tech, while Cadillac, Jeep and Lincoln offer SUVs that are more reserved in their styling and more comfortable in their spacious cabins.\n\nLet’s face it: Big, full-size sedans meant to showcase the best the brand offers are no longer the flagships of any of the world’s top luxury marques. That distinction has been passed to the full-size SUV, a more popular — and usually more expensive — choice than a traditional sedan. It’s understandable; big SUVs are generally roomier, with the ability to carry both people and stuff, and over the last three decades, they’ve evolved from their off-roader origins into luxurious, technological tours de force.\n\nThe redesigned 2022 Lexus LX falls into this category. This new version of the LX is based on the latest global Toyota Land Cruiser, which is no longer offered in the U.S. This heritage gives the LX impressive off-road technology, a powerful engine and a commanding driving position that lets you see the world before you crawl over it with four-wheel-drive traction. As the flagship of the Lexus brand — more even than the LS 600 sedan — the LX also features attention-grabbing styling, new tech and an eye-watering price that should ensure some exclusivity. But is the new Lexus LX a worthy flagship for the Japanese luxury brand? Does it have the tech and touch to justify its lofty price tag?\n\nYou Can’t Escape That Grille\n\nFirst off, I have to talk about the most obvious styling element on the new LX 600: that grille. It employs Lexus’ controversial “spindle grille” theme, a design element that’s been present throughout Lexus’ lineup since it debuted nearly a decade ago. It’s spread like an invasive vine, seemingly becoming more intrusive with every new appearance. It’s culminated in this, the biggest spindle grille ever affixed to a Lexus — evidence of the brand’s insistence upon using it to define the entire aesthetic of its lineup.\n\nI don’t think it works any better here than it does on other Lexuses with the possible exception of the stunning LC 500 coupe and convertible, where the grille actually fits with the spaceship-like styling of the rest of that grand tourer. Here, however, it’s distracting and ridiculously imposing, simply dominating the entire look of the vehicle. It means the LX’s best view is its rear three-quarters, but even from that angle, you’ll notice the odd proportions of this SUV. It has what looks like a short wheelbase with oddly long front and rear overhangs, especially when viewed from the side.\n\nComplicating the aesthetic was the fact that my test vehicle was an F Sport Handling, a trim meant to be more sporty-looking and, potentially, more capable on-road. Cosmetically, it has blacked-out trim, a unique mesh version of the spindle grille, and unique badging, wheels and bumpers. All other trims have a chrome grille that’s more distracting than the blacked-out version on the F Sport, but frankly, you may as well just go for broke with this styling: Opt for the chrome look that emphasizes the grille instead of the one that blacks it out, leaving the front with a big gap where a grille should be.\n\nSlightly Better Inside, But Still Behind\n\nThe LX’s interior is available in a couple of flavors. The F Sport trim I drove had a look best described as spicy given its Circuit Red leather interior. While I applaud Lexus’ chutzpah in including color in its interiors, I’m not sure the F Sport treatment really works on an SUV like this. With its odd mix of off-road equipment, upright driving style and copious mass, “sporty” is the last word I’d use to describe this behemoth SUV — and no amount of aluminum trim or flashy red leather will affect that. Other leather-laden trims are more in keeping with the LX’s ideals, featuring muted blacks, some lovely tans and even an unusual white/Peppercorn maroon treatment, all of which work better in this kind of vehicle.\n\nThe most unfortunate bit is that despite its various premium materials, there’s just a sense that the interior isn’t quite up to snuff for the LX 600’s price. Even the least expensive version is almost $90,000, while the most expensive one approaches $130,000, and the material quality and overall feel of the interior just don’t match that price. There’s too much hard plastic, too many cheap-feeling pieces — too much Toyota in this Lexus flagship. Even closing the doors, which are skinned in aluminum to save weight, makes the truck feel cheap thanks to their super-light feel; there’s no heft to them at all, which is not what one expects in what’s supposed to be a substantial SUV. Contrasting an LX 600 with a Mercedes-Benz GLS, for example, reveals a stark divide; perceived quality and perceived luxury is simply lacking from Lexus’ purported flagship.\n\nTwo Screens Are Better Than One?\n\nThe controls layout is also a bit busy, with two screens where one might have served better. A 12.3-inch upper screen includes Lexus’ new touchscreen multimedia system, which is a vast improvement over the old joystick-controlled version but still falls short of its competitors’ more sophisticated systems,  including BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes’ MBUX. Compared with those systems’ gorgeous graphics, slick menu transitions, and sheer volume of features and information, Lexus’ system seems basic and ordinary, with no more content than you get from your standard Apple CarPlay or Android Auto apps — which are also displayed on that large upper screen. The native navigation system is the same way, but using it now requires a monthly subscription — a daft idea when virtually everyone already has multiple navigation apps on their connected smartphones.\n\nThe lower screen is intended to display things like vehicle system status, climate control, four-wheel-drive equipment mode and more. Thankfully, Lexus hasn’t gone the “glass cockpit” route with its interiors (yet), so there are still buttons and toggles for the controls, making it decidedly easier to use than the latest touchscreen and touch-sensitive-control hijinks from Mercedes-Benz. But it seems unnecessary to have two screens in the vehicle, and Lexus put the one with the most used features farthest away from the driver. The whole thing could have been done better.\n\nComfortable Seating (for Some)\n\nComfort is decent only in the first row. The seats up there are thronelike, with an upright position that puts you high in the saddle, though the steering wheel feels rather low. This is great for outward visibility, which is top-notch, but it makes you feel a bit like you’re driving a bus.\n\nOverall spatial efficiency in the LX is disappointing; it’s surprisingly small inside for an SUV this size. Second-row comfort has inadequate legroom for such a large vehicle, and the third row is nearly unusable for adults. Granted, the LX is on the smaller end of the full-size SUV spectrum, joined down there by the BMW X7, Infiniti QX80 and Land Rover Range Rover. American-style full-size luxury SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Lincoln Navigator dwarf the Lexus LX but aren’t as easy to maneuver or park. Still, this doesn’t explain why sitting comfortably in the LX 600’s second row requires front-seat passengers to move their seats forward and up; otherwise, there’s very little leg- or foot room in the second row. Nor does it explain why nobody can be seated in the second row while raising or folding the third row (the second row must be moved forward to accomplish this task).\n\nThe Saving Grace: Driving It\n\nWhat saves the Lexus LX from being completely relegated to the “no thank you” pile is its driving experience. It may not feel as up to snuff in terms of opulence as many of its competitors, but its driving experience matches them. The LX is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine (the V-8 is long gone) that pumps out a healthy 409 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a super-smooth 10-speed automatic transmission that drives all four wheels through standard full-time four-wheel drive. The F Sport version also features a sport-tuned suspension, which is silly for a vehicle like this — and didn’t make much difference in how the vehicle handled versus the non-F Sport version I drove.\n\nEverything about driving the LX is smooth. Acceleration, transmission shifts and the ride are all smooth and well controlled. In typical Lexus fashion, the idea is to not upset its passengers’ Zen, and the LX most certainly achieves this. It’s still a big, top-heavy, somewhat tippy-feeling SUV — really a Toyota Land Cruiser underneath — but it’s been so well massaged by Lexus’ ride and handling engineers that you’d never connect it with its lesser origins if you didn’t already know. Ride quality is excellent in spite of the F Sport’s big 22-inch wheels (20-inchers are standard), and there’s very little wind noise, just some whoosh from the sideview mirrors. Steering is precise (if rather numb in terms of feedback), and the LX is at home both performing around-town errands and cruising stately down the highway. It also has a significant level of four-wheel-drive equipment aboard thanks to its Land Cruiser roots, including a Multi-Terrain Monitor with under-vehicle cameras; Multi-Terrain Select, which can electronically control various drive systems for off-road driving ; and even a Crawl Control mode for getting unstuck from deep sand and mud. None of this is likely to be used outside the Middle East, but it’s there in case you’re feeling particularly adventurous on your way home from your local Prada boutique.\n\nPriced to Keep It Rare\n\nTop luxury SUVs are all capable of creeping over the $100,000 mark, and the 2022 Lexus LX is no exception. It’s priced to play squarely in the field, with a starting price of $88,245 (including destination fee) for a base LX 600. There are four trim levels above that one with varying degrees of additional standard equipment and different interior color options, culminating in the LX 600 Ultra Luxury trim, which costs $127,345. My test vehicle, an LX600 F Sport Handling, rang in at $105,005.\n\nA Mercedes-Benz GLS450 is nearly $10,000 less expensive to start. It’s also less powerful, though it can be had in a top Maybach trim for well over $160,000 if you add everything. The same is true of the BMW X7, which is even less expensive to start and available in Alpina XB7 guise for nearly $150,000. The bigger American luxury SUVs are a better match price-wise, and they handily outclass the latest LX in interior space, onboard technology and sophistication.\n\nThe 2022 Lexus LX 600 is essentially a status symbol for people who absolutely must have one. Drivers looking for a better-packaged, more luxurious and more comfortable SUV might want to consider the bounty of other options.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus LX 600 Up Close: First-Class Perks for First and Second Rows; Third Row?

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lexus LX 600?\n\nThe Lexus LX 600 is a luxury full-size SUV that seats five people in its standard two-row form; an available third-row seat ups seating capacity to seven. The LX 600 is the largest, priciest, poshest SUV in Lexus’ lineup, and it debuted for 2022 as a replacement for the LX 570. In place of the LX 570’s 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 is a 409-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V-6 engine that’s mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. \n\nTrim levels begin with the base Premium and ascend through Luxury, F Sport and the flagship Ultra Luxury. Four-wheel drive is standard on all trims. The F Sport has a sport-tuned suspension, limited-slip differential, and sporty design touches inside and out. The flagship Ultra Luxury carries a price premium of about $40,000 over the base trim; it seats four and includes a height-adjustable suspension, upgraded cabin trim, a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system, and reclining second-row captain’s chairs with ventilation and massage. LX 600 competitors include the Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer,  Land Rover Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lexus LX 600? \n\nThe LX 600 sees minor changes for its sophomore season, including Takanoha wood trim on the Ultra Luxury model and a standard heated steering wheel.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lexus LX 600 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n20-inch wheels\nDual-screen infotainment system with 12.3- and 7-inch touchscreens\n10-speaker audio system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity\nNavigation system\nWireless charging pad\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nAutomated parking system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking  \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n22-inch wheels \nAdaptive suspension  \n25-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound audio system\nRefrigerated center-console bin\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nHead-up display\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nPower-folding second and third rows\nHands-free power liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated and ventilated second-row seats\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lexus LX 600?\n\nThe LX 600 is a curious mix of old- and new-school SUV characteristics. It has the luxury trim and comfort and convenience features you’d expect in a vehicle with its lofty price tag, plus up-to-date technology features and more off-road capability than most of its buyers will likely ever use. Its truck-based architecture, however, makes it feel ponderous and top-heavy even among competitors with similar body-on-frame architecture. It’s also very space-inefficient in terms of occupant and cargo room, both of which are disappointingly stingy considering the LX 600’s plus-sized exterior dimensions. Fans of the original Toyota Land Cruiser who want an extra-posh, extra-assertive version of that SUV will find the LX 600 an alluring choice; for others, there are plenty of big luxury SUVs that deliver a more well-rounded experience.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus LX 600?\n\nThe Lexus LX 600 is a luxury full-size SUV that seats five people in its standard two-row form; an available third row ups seating capacity to seven. The LX 600 is the largest, priciest, poshest SUV in Lexus’ lineup, powered by a 409-horsepower, 3.4-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 engine that’s mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. \n\nTrim levels begin with a base Premium and ascend through Luxury, F Sport and flagship Ultra Luxury versions. Four-wheel drive is standard on all trims. The F Sport has a sport-tuned suspension, limited-slip differential and sporty design touches inside and out. The flagship Ultra Luxury carries a price premium of more than $40,000 over the base model; it seats four and includes a height-adjustable suspension, upgraded cabin trim, a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system,and reclining second-row captain’s chairs with ventilation and massage. LX 600 competitors include the Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Land Rover Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus LX 600? \n\nThe LX 600 sees no significant changes for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus LX 600 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n20-inch wheels\nDual-screen infotainment system with 12.3- and 7-inch touchscreens\n10-speaker audio system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity\nNavigation system\nWireless charging pad\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nAutomated parking system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking  \nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n22-inch wheels \nAdaptive suspension  \n25-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound audio system\nRefrigerated center console bin\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nHead-up display\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nPower-folding second and third rows\nHands-free power liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated and ventilated second-row seats\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus LX 600?\n\nThe LX 600 is a curious mix of old- and new-school SUV characteristics. It has the comfort and convenience features you’d expect in a vehicle with its lofty price tag, plus up-to-date technology features and more off-road capability than most of its buyers will ever use. Its truck-based architecture, however, makes it feel ponderous and top-heavy, even among competitors with similar body-on-frame architecture. It’s also very inefficient in terms of passenger space and cargo room, both of which are disappointingly stingy considering the LX 600’s plus-sized exterior dimensions. Fans of the original Toyota Land Cruiser who want an extra-posh, extra-assertive version of that SUV will find the LX 600 an alluring choice. For others, there are plenty of big luxury SUVs that deliver a more well rounded experience.",
