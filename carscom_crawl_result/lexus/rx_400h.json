      "expert_review": "In my neck of the woods, Lexus cars and SUVs are everywhere, but none are quite as ubiquitous as the RX series. Seriously, there are three of them just on my block. So I was excited when I got my chance to test one out. I didn’t get just any RX; I got the RX 400h, the newest addition to the RX lineup and a notable one because it’s a hybrid.\n\nThe ’08 RX 400h is a luxury SUV that’s easy to drive and easy on the eyes. It’s comfortable, powerful and useful; I mean, what else do you want? There are lots of high-end features and a high-end price tag to go with them. Oh, you were waiting for the catch, were you?\n\nSadly, this pricey little SUV seems a bit dated. It’s like the SUV that time forgot. The RX series hasn’t changed much since it was introduced for the 1999 model year. That doesn’t mean it’s no good, it’s just not exactly cutting-edge. What’s missing are some of the cool new features, like a proximity key, that can be found in other Lexus models. The big draw here is the hybrid drivetrain, but even that isn’t amazing; the RX 400h still sports a V-6 under the hood and only gets about 5 mpg (combined city/highway) more than the RX 350, the non-hybrid version (I averaged 22.4 mpg during my test week). Still, I enjoyed my time in the RX, mainly because of its exceptionally smooth ride and powerful engine, two things that can cancel out most annoyances in any car.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample Cargo/trunk space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent Fun factor (None, Some, Good times, Groove on): Good times\n\nThe RX hasn’t changed its looks much; it still floats somewhere between cute and elegant. The RX isn’t flashy or trendy, it’s simple and pretty. Its 17-inch wheels and rooftop luggage rack give it a touch of ruggedness. Front-wheel drive is standard on the RX 400h, but four-wheel drive is available. The RX isn’t particularly tall, so getting in and out of it is easy. For me, in fact, the seat seemed to be neither up nor down – I just slid in. Even the kids had no difficulty climbing in and out of the RX 400h, although the doors could be hard for my little guy to reach when they were open all the way. The rear liftgate opens and closes with the push of a button. Power liftgates never get old for me; I still think they’re magical.\n\nMy test RX came in a beautiful deep, dark red color. Lexus calls it Matador Red Mica, but there’s nothing spicy or dangerous about it. It’s not bright or obnoxious; it’s a lovely color and a terrific change from the hordes of silver, black and white SUVs running around out there.\n\nWhat sets the RX 400h apart from the RX 350, other than the drivetrain, is a series of logos and badges all over the SUV’s body proclaiming it to be a hybrid. The “L” and “400h” have blue highlights that are almost incandescent. At first, I thought the blue was just a trick of the light, but no, it’s there on purpose. I’m not sure what blue is supposed to convey, but those badges seemed kind of ’80s-cheesy to me. I could do without them, but at least they’re more subtle than some other manufacturers’ “HYBRID” plaques.\n\nThe inside of the RX 400h is just pretty. Eight-way power controls easily adjust the buttery-soft heated leather seats. A rich wood grain trim creates visual warmth, and a dual climate-control system makes sure everyone in the RX is warm enough. But the entertainment system left me cold. The sound system is adequate but not amazing, and it lacks satellite radio. Also (this is almost unforgivable), there’s no auxiliary jack to hook an iPod or other MP3 player into the stereo system. A color touch-screen provides navigation, audio controls and myriad other settings, but it isn’t the easiest system to figure out. I had to break out the manual, something I rarely have to do, to work the defroster. On the positive side, the Bluetooth link is easy to set up and worked really well for me. Thanks to the hybrid engine, the interior is completely silent at low speeds. In fact, I never got used to the electric engine’s silence. When the V-6 engine cuts in, however, it’s on the loud side, so I guess it averages out.\n\nThe backseat of the RX is roomy and comfy for people big and small alike. Three (smallish) booster seats can fit side-by-side, and the seat belts were easy for my little guys to connect. What was less fabulous was how easily my guys bumped their heads on the rear-entertainment system’s screen, which is anchored in the ceiling. That happened more times than it should have. The entertainment system is completely housed in the rear, which means that I can’t load a DVD while I’m driving, and the kids can stick anything into the DVD player without me knowing. That’s scary, right? I did, however, like the rear armrest that not only provides two cupholders, but also a nifty storage area for toys or other small items. There are two small seatback pockets for books, but they’re on the dinky side, so not much else will fit in them. The rear seats also fold easily in a 40/20/40 split, but I couldn’t get them to lie completely flat.\n\nThe RX 400h has lots of safety features, as you would expect from a luxury SUV. There are nine airbags, including rear side curtain airbags, and the seat belts are height-adjustable in the front seat. The braking system is highly computerized and goes way beyond your simple antilock brakes with its electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Automatic headlights keep the road ahead illuminated, and a rear camera gives a clear view while backing up; this is a must with kids around.\n\nBe aware, however, that some of the really cool safety features are optional in the RX 400h. The high-intensity headlights that swivel to help you see around turns aren’t standard. I also really liked the available sensors on the RX’s exterior that warn you about out-of-view obstacles. The cool adaptive cruise control system uses radar to not only help maintain a safe distance between cars while driving on the highway, but it also activates a bunch of the RX’s safety features milliseconds before an impending collision. I don’t have any intention of using that stuff, but isn’t it nice to know it’s there?",

      "expert_review": "The only luxury hybrid SUV on the market is selling well even as sales of other midsize sport utilities are falling.\n\nBut the fact that consumers who can pay $45,000 and up for the Lexus RX 400h also would care about saving gasoline shows that perhaps even those who can afford higher gasoline prices aren’t particularly eager to spend more on fuel than they have to.\n\nThere has been a feeling among automakers that luxury cars would pretty much be exempt from the pressures on sales that higher fuel prices bring.\n\nBut sport utilities such as the Lexus RX line, typically purchased for everyday family use, might not quite fall into the luxury class, where operating costs are generally not an issue. In fact, the RX 400h price, which begins at just under $45,000 for a two-wheel-drive model, really isn’t all that high in today’s market, where a fully equipped GMC Yukon or Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV can cost even more.\n\nThe RX 400h has EPA ratings of 31 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway, which puts it near the top of the SUV class overall, and well above vehicles such as the Lexus LX 470, with its ratings of 13 mpg city/17 highway.\n\nLexus also has made the RX 400h more affordable than it was when it arrived in April 2005. At first, it was offered only with all-wheel drive, with some amenities that were optional on the gasoline-only RX 330 model – such as a fancy navigation system with a rearview camera. The original base price was just under $50,000, about $12,000 more than a -ase version of the RX 330. Consumer demand prompted the company to roll out a less-well-equipped front-drive model, with a base price of $44,060, and an all-wheel-drive version, also with less standard equipment, for $46,060, Lexus spokesman Greg Thome said. With both of those, the navigation system is optional. And while sales of the RX line overall have fallen this year from last as sales of midsize luxury SUVs have tanked, the hybrid model is still about 23 percent of sales overall, close to the sales targets Lexus had projected for the vehicle, Thome said.\n\nWhile industrywide midsize luxury SUV sales have fallen 17 percent this year through July, compared with the same period last year, the Lexus RX line is down just 2.6 percent for the year, buoyed by sales of the hybrid model.\n\n“It has helped sales that people can now get an RX 400h for a lot less than they could at the start,” he said.\n\nThe $44,060 starting price now represents just a $7,000 premium over the base RX model for 2006. (Prices for 2007 have not been announced.)\n\nThe test vehicle provided to us by Lexus was one of the original all-wheel-drive models that came with the navigation system as part of the vehicle’s then-$48,535 base price (plus $650 freight). Ours had even a few more extras that ran the total sticker up to $52,703 (including freight). They included a DVD rear-seat entertainment system ($1,840); two-level heated front seats, packaged with headlight washers ($540); and an uplevel Mark Levinson audio system ($980).\n\nThe RX 400h looks almost identical to the regular RX, and the only indication it is a hybrid is the “RX 400h” badge on the tail. For 2007, though, the vehicle gets some hybrid badges, something consumers have said they wanted so their vehicles could more easily be recognized as hybrids, Thome said.\n\nThat’s in keeping with the demographics of the typical high-end hybrid buyers, who seem to choose the vehicle more for its “cool” factor than the fact that it has better fuel economy than similar gasoline-only models.\n\nBesides the better fuel economy, the RX 400h has 90 percent lower smog-forming tailpipe emissions than conventionally-powered vehicles, Lexus says.\n\nSimilar to the Toyota Highlander hybrid – both are built on the same architecture and have nearly identical hybrid drive systems – the RX 400h “delivers greater performance, improved fuel efficiency and significantly reduces emissions while sacrificing none of its luxury or utility,” says Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota.\n\nThe two-wheel-drive RX 400h has a 3.3-liter V-6 gasoline engine with a high-torque electric drive motor-generator up front. The all-wheel-drive version has those elements along with a second electric motor driving the rear axle.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive model we tested had a combined 268 horsepower (gasoline engine and electric motors together), and 3,500 foot-pounds of axle torque at startup. The vehicle can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.3 seconds, better than many of the hybrid’s V-8-powered competitors.\n\nBesides the “RX 400h” badge, styling differences from the base RX model include a unique grille, front fascia with an additional air intake, round fog lights, special 18-inch alloy wheels and LED taillights.\n\nInterior differences include special brushed-aluminum accents (replacing the gasoline model’s wood trim) and a power meter, which replaces the tachometer. Lexus says the RX 400h is a “full hybrid,” which means it can run on electric only, gasoline only or a combination of these.\n\nThe power steering pump, water pump and air-conditioning compressor are not driven by a belt from the gasoline engine. Instead, they are electrically powered. This allows them to continue functioning when the gasoline engine shuts down at idle or low speeds.\n\nPowering the electric motors is a 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery pack under the rear seat. The batteries are automatically recharged as the vehicle slows down or coasts, or when it is running on the gasoline engine only.\n\nUnlike electric cars, the hybrid does not require plugging into an external electric power source to recharge the batteries.\n\nA third electric motor is used up front as a starter and does not deliver any power to the wheels. As with the other two motors, though, it doubles as an electric-power generator when the vehicle is coasting or braking.\n\nThis third motor can either charge the battery pack or provide power to the other two electric motors as needed, Lexus says.\n\nA continuously variable automatic transmission is used to drive the front wheels. The separate 50-kilowatt electric motor at the rear of the all-wheel-drive model provides up to 650 foot-pounds of torque on demand, Lexus says.\n\nAmong high-tech safety features are a stability control system and electronically controlled braking.\n\nOther safety features include seat-mounted side air bags for the front occupants and side-curtain air bags for front and rear passengers.\n\nUnlike the Highlander, the RX 400h is offered with only two rows of seating, for a maximum of five people; the Highlander hybrid comes with a third seat and can hold seven passengers. Cargo capacity is 38.3 cubic feet behind the second seat, the same as in the RX 330. That can be expanded to almost 85 cubic feet by folding down the rear seat, which has a 40/20/40 split design. Among other standard features are rain-sensing windshield wipers and adaptive front headlights that shine in the direction the car is turning.\n\nOther amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control; a 10-way power front driver’s seat with memory and an eight-way power passenger seat; a three-spoke steering wheel with controls for the audio system, trip computer and driver-information display; an auto-dimming rearview mirror with digital compass; power, heated, self-dimming outside mirrors; a power single-piece rear liftgate; a power tilt/telescopic steering wheel with memory; a one-touch power moon roof; an illuminated entry system that lights the door handles, scuff plates and front foot wells; and a universal garage/gate opener.\n\nThe optional Mark Levinson audio system has 11 speakers and a six-disc CD changer in the dash.\n\nG.
