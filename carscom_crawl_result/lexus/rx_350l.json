      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThe five-seat Lexus RX mid-size luxury SUV is available in gas RX 350 or hybrid RX 450h form. There’s also a performance-oriented F Sport model and a three-row L version that seats up to seven. All use a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and the RX 450h adds electric motors.\n\nThe RX 350 is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The RX 450h is all-wheel-drive only, with an electric motor driving the rear wheels. Competitors include the Cadillac XT5, Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather-trimmed interior\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nMark Levinson premium stereo\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nOften credited with creating the luxury crossover SUV class, the Lexus RX continues to please buyers looking for refinement, but our editors find it less engaging to drive than some competitors. The Remote Touch multimedia interface remains frustrating, but the inclusion of a touchscreen makes it less of an issue than it was previously. The cramped third row in extended L versions is of dubious usefulness.",

      "expert_review": "Until now, Lexus had a problem: In the age of the SUV, the company was missing a city-oriented three-row model that could carry more than five occupants. The Lexus GX 460 and LX 570 SUVs have third rows, but both are more on the rugged side, with body-on-frame construction and big, fuel-hungry V-8s under their hoods. Those models effectively take luxury off the beaten path, but they aren’t as well-suited for suburban or city life.\n\nThat’s where the new 2018 RX is meant to come in, offering three rows of seating and available in both gas-only (RX 350L) and hybrid (RX 450hL) versions. Each represents a price premium over the standard RX: The 350L starts at $48,665 with front-wheel drive and $50,065 with all-wheel drive — a $4,200 increase over the regular-length RX 350. The RX 450hL comes only with AWD and starts at $51,615 ($4,725 more than the regular RX 450).\n\nMuch of what’s found in the first two rows (for better or worse) is the same as in the regular RX, so what you’re paying for in essence is that extra seating capacity.\n\nExtra Length, Extra Room?\n\nThe RX 350L is longer than the standard RX 350 by 4.4 inches, but it has the same wheelbase and overall width (compare the two vehicles here). The additional length goes directly to the third row. On the spec sheet, the RX 350L has significantly less second-row legroom than the RX 350 (38 inches vs. 30.9 inches), but I didn’t find this to feel true in practice — there was still plenty of room in the second row for adults in terms of both legroom and headroom, and the seat slides forward and back on tracks so you can negotiate some extra breathing space between the rows if needed. That could explain the spec disparity; sometimes a sliding backseat complicates specifications because the automaker chooses where to position the seat for measurements. The decreased second-row legroom may reflect that the third row’s spec was given more space.\n\nEven so, things aren’t rosy in the third row, which has a reported 23.5 inches of legroom. I realize that figure is kind of abstract, so let me put it in more concrete terms: I can’t get the second-row bench to lock back into place in its track if I sit facing forward, I have to stick my legs to the side to complete the task — and then keep them there.\n\nTo test out the third row’s real-world usability, I enlisted the help of some friends (or at least I hope they still are). As six of us left an escape room, I put them through an escape of a different kind: 15 minutes in the car on the way to dinner. I put the two smallest people in back (a 5-foot-9-inch male and a 5-foot-4-inch female), and all of us worked together to try to make the space work, moving the front seats up and the second-row bench as far forward as it could go. But even at that point, there was no saving the situation. I turned back to ask our third-row passengers how they were faring, but the question caught in my throat when I saw their heads kinked to the side — there isn’t enough headroom to sit up straight, either.\n\nThe final blow to the third row is visibility. The RX 350L’s roof and back pillar design gives third-row passengers only a tiny porthole to look out, making it feel even more cramped than it already does. One may think that the third row is suitable for children, but I think it’s too small even for that, and there’s only one child safety seat tether on the driver’s side and no lower Latch anchors to boot. The only redeeming attribute I could find for the third row is that it has its own set of climate controls.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the second-row bench can be swapped out for captain’s chairs in the gas version, and the captain’s chairs are standard on the hybrid. They help third-row accessibility somewhat, as you can climb back between the seats rather than off to the side, which is a passageway meant only for people who subsist on salads.\n\nThe third row also eats into cargo room when it’s in place, leaving only 7.5 cubic feet. That space expands to 23.0 cubic feet when you stow the seats away into the floor (via a helpful set of powered controls in the cargo area), beating the standard RX 350’s 18.4 cubic feet. Just don’t expect to carry more than five occupants and their luggage unless you plan to take advantage of their laps.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nThough the third row is a major downer, the rest of the interior apes much of what you’d find on the standard RX 350, and that’s just fine by me. Lexus has a proficiency for crafting quiet, high-quality cabins, and the RX 350L is no exception. The RX 350L does get standard leather upholstery over the RX 350’s faux leather, and the Noble Brown version on my test vehicle was a highlight for me.\n\nUp front, the center console is pretty wide and slightly invades leg space, especially on the driver’s side. Luckily, it’s padded to make your right knee more comfortable, but taller drivers should ensure they fit comfortably before buying.\n\nThe cabin’s overall quality and comfort are pluses, but the big minus for the RX 350L is the same problem that plagues the rest of the vehicles in Lexus’ lineup: the Remote Touch interface. The available 12.3-inch screen that sits atop the dashboard is fine, but the only way to interact with it is through a mouselike control sitting between the front seats. It’s an unnatural, difficult way to use a system that’s also plagued by an overabundance of menus and hard-to-settle-on controls. Our staff is starting to sound like a broken record on this, but as long as Lexus insists on trotting out this substandard system, we’ll call it what it is.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe RX 350L’s driving experience is comfort-oriented. It smooths out road imperfections nicely, and I didn’t detect much tire or road noise. In fact, there wasn’t much noise at all; cabin isolation is a strength. The counterpoint is that the car languishes in corners, with plenty of body roll and an aversion to quick changes of direction. But I think the tradeoff is one this vehicle’s likely buyers will be willing to make for its comfort and composure over rough roads.\n\nUnder the hood is a 290-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The RX 350L comes with front- or all-wheel drive, which commands a $1,400 premium. RX 450hL models come only with AWD and pair the 3.5-liter V-6 with a continuously variable automatic transmission and an electric motor to produce 308 hp total.\n\nI tested only the gas version, which has decent acceleration — enough grunt to keep the luxurious feeling, but not enough to get you into any trouble (or fun, as I like to call it).\n\nFuel economy for the RX 350L is an EPA-estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined for FWD models and 18/25/21 mpg with AWD. That’s 1 mpg worse than the RX 350 across the board. The RX 450hL is rated 29/28/29 mpg, which lags the regular version by 1 mpg combined.\n\nSafety Remains a Strength\n\nThe RX 350L comes with a strong set of standard safety features wrapped in a bundle Lexus refers to as Lexus Safety System Plus. The technology includes forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop. Also standard are rain-sensing wipers and 10 years of Lexus Enform Safety Connect, which offers emergency assistance and can send responders to the vehicle’s GPS location.\n\nFor those who want more, there are also available LED cornering lamps, a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic automatic braking (not just alerts), a windshield wiper de-icer, parking sensors and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe systems all worked seamlessly in my testing, though the lane keep assist does have a propensity to bounce the car from one side of the lane to the other. A more effective lane-centering system, which Lexus calls Lane Trace Assist, has appeared on some models, but not the RX.\n\nRX 350L competitors include three-row luxury SUVs such as the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 (compare the RX 350L with those models here). While none of them have what I would call “expansive” third rows, they are larger than the tiny one found in the RX 350L and can be used for at least short journeys without too much trouble.\n\nThe RX 350L’s entire reason for existing is kind of a letdown, and that influences the rest of my feelings about the vehicle. If Lexus wants to add a city-friendly three-row SUV to its lineup, it would be better served by coming out with a new model instead of trying to shoehorn a third row into an existing one.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Until now, Lexus had a problem: In the age of the SUV, the company was missing a city-oriented three-row model that could carry more than five occupants. The Lexus GX 460 and LX 570 SUVs have third rows, but both are more on the rugged side, with body-on-frame construction and big, fuel-hungry V-8s under their hoods. Those models effectively take luxury off the beaten path, but they aren’t as well-suited for suburban or city life.\n\nThat’s where the new 2018 RX is meant to come in, offering three rows of seating and available in both gas-only (RX 350L) and hybrid (RX 450hL) versions. Each represents a price premium over the standard RX: The 350L starts at $48,665 with front-wheel drive and $50,065 with all-wheel drive — a $4,200 increase over the regular-length RX 350. The RX 450hL comes only with AWD and starts at $51,615 ($4,725 more than the regular RX 450).\n\nMuch of what’s found in the first two rows (for better or worse) is the same as in the regular RX, so what you’re paying for in essence is that extra seating capacity.\n\nExtra Length, Extra Room?\n\nThe RX 350L is longer than the standard RX 350 by 4.4 inches, but it has the same wheelbase and overall width (compare the two vehicles here). The additional length goes directly to the third row. On the spec sheet, the RX 350L has significantly less second-row legroom than the RX 350 (38 inches vs. 30.9 inches), but I didn’t find this to feel true in practice — there was still plenty of room in the second row for adults in terms of both legroom and headroom, and the seat slides forward and back on tracks so you can negotiate some extra breathing space between the rows if needed. That could explain the spec disparity; sometimes a sliding backseat complicates specifications because the automaker chooses where to position the seat for measurements. The decreased second-row legroom may reflect that the third row’s spec was given more space.\n\nEven so, things aren’t rosy in the third row, which has a reported 23.5 inches of legroom. I realize that figure is kind of abstract, so let me put it in more concrete terms: I can’t get the second-row bench to lock back into place in its track if I sit facing forward, I have to stick my legs to the side to complete the task — and then keep them there.\n\nTo test out the third row’s real-world usability, I enlisted the help of some friends (or at least I hope they still are). As six of us left an escape room, I put them through an escape of a different kind: 15 minutes in the car on the way to dinner. I put the two smallest people in back (a 5-foot-9-inch male and a 5-foot-4-inch female), and all of us worked together to try to make the space work, moving the front seats up and the second-row bench as far forward as it could go. But even at that point, there was no saving the situation. I turned back to ask our third-row passengers how they were faring, but the question caught in my throat when I saw their heads kinked to the side — there isn’t enough headroom to sit up straight, either.\n\nThe final blow to the third row is visibility. The RX 350L’s roof and back pillar design gives third-row passengers only a tiny porthole to look out, making it feel even more cramped than it already does. One may think that the third row is suitable for children, but I think it’s too small even for that, and there’s only one child safety seat tether on the driver’s side and no lower Latch anchors to boot. The only redeeming attribute I could find for the third row is that it has its own set of climate controls.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the second-row bench can be swapped out for captain’s chairs in the gas version, and the captain’s chairs are standard on the hybrid. They help third-row accessibility somewhat, as you can climb back between the seats rather than off to the side, which is a passageway meant only for people who subsist on salads.\n\nThe third row also eats into cargo room when it’s in place, leaving only 7.5 cubic feet. That space expands to 23.0 cubic feet when you stow the seats away into the floor (via a helpful set of powered controls in the cargo area), beating the standard RX 350’s 18.4 cubic feet. Just don’t expect to carry more than five occupants and their luggage unless you plan to take advantage of their laps.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nThough the third row is a major downer, the rest of the interior apes much of what you’d find on the standard RX 350, and that’s just fine by me. Lexus has a proficiency for crafting quiet, high-quality cabins, and the RX 350L is no exception. The RX 350L does get standard leather upholstery over the RX 350’s faux leather, and the Noble Brown version on my test vehicle was a highlight for me.\n\nUp front, the center console is pretty wide and slightly invades leg space, especially on the driver’s side. Luckily, it’s padded to make your right knee more comfortable, but taller drivers should ensure they fit comfortably before buying.\n\nThe cabin’s overall quality and comfort are pluses, but the big minus for the RX 350L is the same problem that plagues the rest of the vehicles in Lexus’ lineup: the Remote Touch interface. The available 12.3-inch screen that sits atop the dashboard is fine, but the only way to interact with it is through a mouselike control sitting between the front seats. It’s an unnatural, difficult way to use a system that’s also plagued by an overabundance of menus and hard-to-settle-on controls. Our staff is starting to sound like a broken record on this, but as long as Lexus insists on trotting out this substandard system, we’ll call it what it is.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe RX 350L’s driving experience is comfort-oriented. It smooths out road imperfections nicely, and I didn’t detect much tire or road noise. In fact, there wasn’t much noise at all; cabin isolation is a strength. The counterpoint is that the car languishes in corners, with plenty of body roll and an aversion to quick changes of direction. But I think the tradeoff is one this vehicle’s likely buyers will be willing to make for its comfort and composure over rough roads.\n\nUnder the hood is a 290-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The RX 350L comes with front- or all-wheel drive, which commands a $1,400 premium. RX 450hL models come only with AWD and pair the 3.5-liter V-6 with a continuously variable automatic transmission and an electric motor to produce 308 hp total.\n\nI tested only the gas version, which has decent acceleration — enough grunt to keep the luxurious feeling, but not enough to get you into any trouble (or fun, as I like to call it).\n\nFuel economy for the RX 350L is an EPA-estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined for FWD models and 18/25/21 mpg with AWD. That’s 1 mpg worse than the RX 350 across the board. The RX 450hL is rated 29/28/29 mpg, which lags the regular version by 1 mpg combined.\n\nSafety Remains a Strength\n\nThe RX 350L comes with a strong set of standard safety features wrapped in a bundle Lexus refers to as Lexus Safety System Plus. The technology includes forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop. Also standard are rain-sensing wipers and 10 years of Lexus Enform Safety Connect, which offers emergency assistance and can send responders to the vehicle’s GPS location.\n\nFor those who want more, there are also available LED cornering lamps, a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic automatic braking (not just alerts), a windshield wiper de-icer, parking sensors and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe systems all worked seamlessly in my testing, though the lane keep assist does have a propensity to bounce the car from one side of the lane to the other. A more effective lane-centering system, which Lexus calls Lane Trace Assist, has appeared on some models, but not the RX.\n\nRX 350L competitors include three-row luxury SUVs such as the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 (compare the RX 350L with those models here). While none of them have what I would call “expansive” third rows, they are larger than the tiny one found in the RX 350L and can be used for at least short journeys without too much trouble.\n\nThe RX 350L’s entire reason for existing is kind of a letdown, and that influences the rest of my feelings about the vehicle. If Lexus wants to add a city-friendly three-row SUV to its lineup, it would be better served by coming out with a new model instead of trying to shoehorn a third row into an existing one.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Up until the 2020 Lexus RX, every modern Lexus came with an annoying asterisk: Yes, it was a fine vehicle, but the touchpad or mouselike multimedia controls were so confounding and frustrating that it eventually made you think Luddites had it pretty good. So what’s changed for 2020? The updated 2020 Lexus RX ditches the mouse and adds a touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, addressing one (or is it several?) of the luxury SUV’s weakest areas.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX and RXL Preview: Rejuvenating an Aging Icon\n\nThe 2020 Lexus RX isn’t without its quirks; the asterisk is just a little smaller. The touchscreen and tech enhancements are the most significant changes for 2020, though a bunch of little things — new smartphone holder, over-the-air updates, expanded F-Sport line — have similar executions: They sound great on paper but are a little less impressive in practice. The bulk of the RX is unchanged, available in five-seat RX 350 and hybrid RX 450h variants, along with an L version of each that includes a small third row for a total of six or seven seats.\n\nBring on the Touchscreen!\n\nWe all gasped when we heard Lexus was getting a touchscreen — actually, it was a sigh of relief — because the way the previous Lexus RX controlled the non-touch display distracted drivers, requiring them to use the mouse to select a little button. No longer, as the 2020 RX gets a standard 8-inch touchscreen or the optional, vibrant 12.3-inch touchscreen I sampled. Lexus moved the screen 5 inches closer to the driver for 2020, though that might not be enough. I’m 6 feet tall with long arms and like to sit fairly close to the wheel, so I didn’t have a problem using the screen while driving, but the touchscreen might prove too far to be useful if you have shorter arms and/or like to sit farther back; I had to fully extend my arm to reach the far end of the screen. Oddly, Lexus’ Remote Touchpad, seen in other models, snuck into the party when no one was looking, but it’s relatively obsolete in this application because of the touchscreen, and I used it only for the menu button during my short drive. If you can’t reach the touchscreen, the touchpad is how you’ll have to control CarPlay/Android Auto; Godspeed, you poor short-armed bastard.\n\nMy preference is the RX’s widescreen format — a style also offered on the BMW X5 — versus the vertically oriented touchscreen in a Volvo XC90. I exclusively use Apple CarPlay while driving, and CarPlay fills the entire display on widescreens like the Lexus, versus on a Volvo where CarPlay is stuck in a little box on the bottom half of the screen, barely larger than the plus-sized phone providing the function. In the RX, all 12.3 inches show CarPlay, so the buttons are large and easy to press (if you can reach them), and annoyingly long podcast titles that would normally be cut off in a small screen are fully displayed.\n\nOver-the-Air Map Updates\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor those who don’t use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which provide navigation from a smartphone, the optional built-in navigation system is quite good and boosted for 2020 with more humanized voice recognition (it recognized numerous ways I asked to get to the nearest Starbucks). Most notable is that there are now over-the-air navigation updates that replace the need for a physical SD card. This isn’t the first Lexus to receive the system, named Dynamic Navigation, but it’s new to the RX. When maps are updated, the update comes straight into the RX via the onboard cellular connection. The functionality is active only if you subscribe to Lexus’ Enform cellular service, however, which comes with a free three-year trial before a subscription is required, and the updates are good only for navigation. Unlike the Tesla Model X, you won’t be getting vehicle functionality or systems updates. Those kinds of updates aren’t out of scope, however, as Lexus College senior product specialist Bob Gleich says there are numerous regulatory hoops Lexus must hop through first before that can happen.\n\nCellphone Holder — Brilliant Idea, So-So Execution\n\nLexus has an intriguing solution for storing phones, a center console cellphone pocket. The sizable slot was large enough to hold my iPhone Plus, which is impressive because my monster of a phone is wrapped in a toddler-proof thick, shock-resistant case. The holder stands the phone up vertically so it’s not using storage space in the cubby if laid down flat. Another bonus: The phone won’t fly out of a bin when accelerating like it does in some cars. On the downside, this cubby won’t wirelessly charge your phone, and CarPlay isn’t wireless as in some BMWs and Audis, so you’ll have to string a data/charge cable across the cupholders to the center console. Oddly, the USB ports literally right next to the phone holder are charge only, and not data ports that stream CarPlay/Android Auto and music to the media system like in the center console storage bin.\n\nDouble the F Sport\n\nThe sportier RX F Sport trim comes in two flavors for 2020, a regular F Sport with unique grille, tuned-up shock absorbers and fancy wheels, while an F Sport Performance is new, though I question the value in that package. The $4,850 F Sport Performance Package adds adaptive shocks with adjustable firmness similar to the Lexus LC 500 sports car, which is perhaps the one Lexus where its goofy controls can be glossed over because it’s that good. Lexus calls this adaptive variable suspension, but the RX with this heightened package remains one of the more buttery riding SUVs out there, even in the most aggressive Sport Plus mode that you don’t get on lesser RXs. The RX F Sport Performance Package remains perfectly comfortable for everyday use while giving you a shred of road feel you don’t get on the base suspension car (non-F Sport). When thrown into a corner, however, there aren’t the chops that would make you want to do it again, and the Sport Plus mode doesn’t do the engine and transmission any favors because it shifts conservatively, upshifting mid-corner and trying to get to the next gear as soon as possible. The paddle shifters work well here for maintaining a gear, but it’s not unique to the F Sport any longer because all RXs get steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual gear control, even the hybrid RX 450h.\n\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe F Sport Performance Package adds a sound tube for an extra bit of noise from under the hood, doing it mechanically versus electronic augmentation, according to Gleich, and you can hear a little extra muscly sound between 5,000 and 6,000 rpm, though only briefly. I haven’t driven the non-Performance-Package F Sport, but compared with the regular RX I drove, I don’t think you’ll be missing much if you skip the F Sport Performance Package.\n\nShould You Buy the 2019 or 2020 Lexus RX?\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne new feature worth mentioning is the RX’s newly available kick-to-open tailgate, which like many of the 2020 additions normalizes the RX a tad more. Previously, you had to hold your hand over the Lexus badge to open it (doesn’t make much sense for a hands-free system), and now with a handful of groceries the rear power tailgate can be opened with a quick kick under the center of the bumper. In my testing, this worked five out of five times, an accomplishment for these types of systems that don’t always trigger when asked.\n\nIf you’ve deemed the RX’s size and price a good fit, then actively seek out the 2020 RX, which addresses one of the RX’s biggest shortcomings thanks to a more normalized control system and a host of new connectivity features.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert and power-folding, auto-dimming side mirrors now standard; wireless charging now available; new Glazed Caramel interior color available; F Sport Performance Package renamed F Sport Handling Package\n\nPrice change: $920 for two-row; $600 for three-row L versions\n\nOn sale: Early fall\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? The price increase for L models is modest enough that it seems worth it for the additional content compared to a 2020. Two-row models may require more careful consideration of price and features. \n\nAfter significant updates for the 2020 model year, Lexus announced mild updates to its popular RX line of SUVs for 2021, including additional standard safety technology and convenience features.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX Review: Just What the Doctor Ordered\n\nPricing\n\nPricing for the entry-level models is below. Two-row models increase by $920 while the three-row L versions are $600 more expensive.\n\n2021 RX 350 (FWD): $46,095 (up $920 over 2020)\n2021 RX 450h (AWD): $48,745 (up $920)\n2021 RX 350L (FWD): $48,925 (up $600)\n2021 RX 450hL (AWD): $52,135 (up $600) \nOptions\n\nBuyers can add an F Sport appearance package to the two-row 350 and 450h for an additional $3,480, giving the SUV a more aggressive look and adding things like F Sport-specific front seats. \n\nOn top of that, there’s an F Sport Handling (nee Performance) Package that adds an adaptive suspension, sport steering, sound enhancement and, in the 350, Lexus’ Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management system (already standard on the hybrid 450h). That will cost an additional $2,400 on the 350 and $2,320 on the 450h, on top of the $3,480 for the appearance package. (Technically, the Handling package is only $1,050 or $970, respectively, but it seems to require the addition of a power moonroof and aluminum roof rails for an extra $1,350.) \n\nThe Black Line appearance package is available on the RX 350 and 450h F Sport. Building on the F Sport, for an additional $685 it adds trendy darkened exterior accents.\n\nThree-row models don’t offer F Sport anything, but can be upgraded with a $6,000 Luxury Package that adds higher-quality interior materials, different wheels and additional comfort and convenience features.\n\nRelease Date\n\nLexus says 2021 models should start arriving at dealerships early this fall, so expect to see them available soon.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
