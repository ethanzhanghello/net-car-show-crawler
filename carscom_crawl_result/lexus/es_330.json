      "expert_review": "As a new mother, I just don’t feel as sexy, classy, or sophisticated as I use to. In the past, I dressed for the occasion. I find that the transition from always wearing the latest fashions to just trying to match the spit up rag is, needles to say, difficult. Like most moms out there, I have to constantly change clothes because I have “something” all over me.\n\nI digress; where was I? Oh yes, back to the sweet sophistication of “the car.” As I walk up to the 2005 Lexus ES330, I begin to feel very classy and sophisticated – you know, like those Calgon commercials when all the troubles of the day just melt away. This ES330 really stands out to me saying “Hello? Yes, you there, momma – take me for a spin!” Yeah, something like that.\n\nWhen I open the door to slide in, I find the perforated leather very nice, coupled with the wood grain interior. As my hands grip the steering wheel; oooh, wood grain surrounded by leather. Nice touch!\n\nAt that moment, I know what I have to do. I need to take the ES330 out on the town for some grocery getting and errand running. Once my husband “Latches” in the baby seat base, I cautiously place her in the car seat, and gently set her in the back seat. My husband notes that the baby seat base is rather simple to place in the back of the ES330, and there is still plenty of room to maneuver around.\n\nOnce in the car and loaded up with my water bottle, I place myself in the lap of luxury. Oops, as I place my very standardized water bottle in the cup holder, I noticed there is no way the bottle is going to stay put.\n\nCoping with the water bottle debacle is tragic enough, or so I think. As every mom knows, one must have room to store “stuff.” What kind of stuff? You know your stuff. Typically, stuff can be stored in the console between the driver and passenger seat. However, in the ES330, the CD changer takes up most of the room in where my stuff is to go.\n\nI turn the ignition, listen to the engine rev, put the ES330 in drive and zoom off for my first errand. What a smooth ride! I usually dread going over the potholes, and let me tell you, there are plenty to complain about, but this car feels somewhat like floating on air. Smoothness factor? So smooth in fact that my daughter is sleeping within a quarter-mile. Very impressive!\n\nNow, I am not one to read manuals in full detail. I would much rather push the different buttons to see what they will do (ask my husband, I just love pushing buttons). There is this one button by the gearshift that I keep pushing to see what it does. Nothing. I finally look in the rearview mirror and catch a glance of a sunshade going up and down. Soon, this becomes my favorite feature, or my daughter’s favorite feature, as we all know how much babies love to have sun in their eyes.\n\nAfter the first errand is complete, I decide to play with the navigation and voice-activated system. I love that when I touch the screen, it gives me the name of the business located there. It also shows me where all of the gas stations are, which is convenient for those of us who wait till the last minute to fill up. I won’t mention any names, of course.\n\nBeing that Mother Proof’s “global headquarters” is in Colorado, the weather changes on a dime without warning. So, true to description, in the middle of running around, the rain begins to fall. With the rain coming down, the rain-sensing windshield wipers begin to wish-wash without me so much as pushing or twisting a thing.\n\nWith the daily grind of groceries and errands complete, my daughter and I are off to spend the rest of the day at Grandma and Grandpa’s, which means that I have to pack everything into the trunk; the activity mat, stroller, baby bag and scrapbooking supplies. I must say the trunk holds everything very nicely. It’s not the easiest to get all of these items out, but they fit.\n\nSince becoming a mom, so much has changed. Driving this car gives me the feeling of being a very classy mom. You have to love that!\n\n*For more information on the Lexus ES330 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "ES 330 runs pricey and plain\n\nAs we were test-driving the 2004 Lexus ES 330, a key sticking point was this: How much — if any — sex appeal does this revised Japanese entry-luxury sedan exude?\n\nFew can argue with the more tangible details of the ES 330, which is the new name for the old ES 300.\n\nFor 2004, the sedan gets a more powerful 3.3-liter V-6 engine, bigger side air bags and lots of nice little details, including an improved navigation system.\n\nWe tested a lavishly equipped model that included options like $440 heated front seats, $650 vehicle stability control, a $210 power rear sun shade and a $3,120 package that included navigation and audio systems. Bottom line: $38,495.\n\nShe: It was a little eerie that the week we were testing the ES 330, I got a call from a reader in suburban Washington, D.C., who was unhappy with his new ES 330 and thinking about trading it in on an Infiniti G35. He described the Lexus as “an old man’s car — a passenger’s car and not a driver’s car.” He said he wanted a little more fun and excitement in the driving experience. Then I asked him his age. 81! Wow — you go guy!\n\nHe: Gee, do you think the Levitra’s gone to his head? Although he definitely has me by a decade or two, I disagree in one respect. While it doesn’t have the sheer performance of the G35 or the new Acura TL, the ES 330 is still a pleasant car to drive, especially with the larger engine. I would also describe it as pretty conservative, but there is clearly a market for that type of vehicle, especially for people who think the Infiniti looks a little cheap on the inside.\n\nShe: Who’s to say that conservative can’t be sexy? Look at George Bush. I think the ES 330 is just about perfect and I gave it five stars. What would make it sexy? A throaty exhaust note? Flashy rims? Those sorts of things would be utterly ridiculous on such an elegant car.\n\nHe: I’m trying to visualize John Kerry with “flashy rims.” It’s not a pretty picture. If Lexus has an image problem, it may be that the ES 330 is too close on the Toyota family tree to the Camry — another solid, but even more vanilla offering. Yes, the ES 330 has solid assembly quality and top-drawer workmanship. But those qualities don’t mean it will also have personality and appeal. For 2004, Lexus chose to tweak the ES 330, improving it here and there, but outside of the new engine, not doing anything dramatic, say, along the lines of Cadillac adopting that edgy look with its products.\n\nShe: I won’t argue that the G35 and the TL offer a sportier driving experience than the ES 330, although you can opt for the adaptive variable suspension on the Lexus. The driver can choose between four settings, ranging from comfort to sport.\n\nHe: It’s a superior option that really works. But the biggest news on the ES 330 is the twin-cam 3.3-liter V-6, which replaces the previous 3.0-liter V-6. The 3.3-liter makes 225 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of torque, which is a nice jump from last year’s model. Lexus also revised the standard five-speed automatic transmission so it would better match the bigger engine. You’ll pay almost no penalty in fuel consumption, though. The ES 330 gets the same EPA rating on the highway — 29 miles per gallon — as the old model.\n\nShe: I was dazzled by the long list of standard safety features on the ES 330, including bigger side air bags, front and rear side curtain air bags that protect all four outboard passengers, anti-lock brakes and front seats designed to lessen the possibility of a whiplash injury. Lexus just continues to improve this sedan. The front passenger seat adds power lumbar adjustment, the nav system has new modes, including upcoming freeway exits and easier-to-understand graphics. I had to scramble to come up with dislikes, and they were few. I didn’t like the location of the CD changer in the center console — too tough to reach whe you’re driving. But that’s fairly minor.\n\nHe: I’m not so reticent. The standard power moonroof cuts down on the rear-seat headroom, and I found the rear seat legroom to be cramped, too. And once you start piling on the options, like your beloved nav system, the ES 330 price starts to climb perilously close to $40,000. That kind of money will buy you a serious luxury car, not an entry-level model like the ES 330. But the standard car, at just under $32,000, is a pretty good deal.\n\nShe: I’m still a big fan of the ES 330. You guys can have your Infinitis and Acuras. In this case, it’s a good thing we have a two-car garage.\n\nAnita’s rating:\n\nLikes: Elegant, subtle styling. Excellent standard safety features, including front and rear side curtain air bags. New navigation system even shows buildings in 3D to help you recognize them. Optional power-adjustable pedals have memory feature. Cool options — power rear sunshade lowers when you shift into reverse. Loads of standard luxury features like heated mirrors, 10-way power driver’s seat.\n\nDislikes: Useless purse holder. CD changer in center console difficult to access. Stability control is an extra $650.\n\nPaul’s rating:\n\nLikes: Exceptional assembly quality. Roomy, comfortable front seats. Smooth, powerful new 3.3-liter V-6 engine. Ride comfort exceptional with optional adaptive suspension. Roomy, easy-to-access trunk.\n\nDislikes: Too pricey when you add up all the extras. Pretty conservative inside and out. Not as fun or sexy as Infiniti G35. Limited rear head and leg room.",
