      "expert_review": "I gave a low whistle when I looked at the bottom line of the window sticker when the Lexus LS 430 arrived in my driveway.\n\nI exhaled sharply again when I studied it more closely and saw that a single options package had added more than 12 grand to the base price – that, I believe, is a record.\n\nWith a bottom-line tab of $71,453, the Lexus flagship sedan is solidly in luxury territory; in fact, its makers are wont to compare it with the Mercedes-Benz S Class machines, which start around that price and roar up to $117K when powered by a 12-cylinder engine.\n\nWhen the big Lexus debuted, in the last decade of the last millennium, it was offered as a budget-conscious alternative to the big Benzes. Over time, it grew in prestige as drivers discovered how well built it was, and how pleasant the relationship with dealers could be.\n\nThe third generation of the flagship debuted last year, totally redesigned. The switch from LS 400 to LS 430 designation denoted that the engine, along with wheelbase and height, had increased in size, even though overall length remained a garage-friendly 196.7 inches.\n\nThe LS 430 is essentially still a bargain-priced Mercedes killer, if you can live with it in standard form. And you might.\n\nFor a base price of $54,980 (freight included), you get a splendid automobile, differing only in trivial ways mechanically from what you get at the “ultra luxury” level. It comes with the same 4.3-liter, 32-valve, double-overhead-cam V-8 and five-speed automatic transmission. The only significant difference is that at the $70K level, the tires are upsized to 17-inchers from the “base” 16 – but those are available as a separate option on the base car, too.\n\nI’ll take a deep breath here, and recite what you get in the $12,485 ultra luxury package: Mark Levinson audio upgrade (a name to conjure with in audiophile circles); navigation system; Lexus Link (an OnStar equivalent); power moonroof; dynamic laser cruise control; air suspension; four-spoke wood and leather steering wheel; laminated, water-repellent side glass; power rear window and manual rear door sunshades; “intuitive parking assist”; rear seat adjuster with power slide and memory; heated rear seats with massager; front climate-controlled seats with heat/cool options; rear air conditioner with microfiltration; headlamp washer and power door closers (a power trunk closer is standard on the cheapo).\n\nNow imagine all that grafted onto a car that in base trim has a full load of goodies; you might feel recklessly self-indulgent if $70K is other than walking-around money to you.\n\nThe pampering provided to the rear cabin passengers reflects Lexus’s view that some owners will hang out there, with Jeeves doing the driving. Must be awful not to be able to afford a proper Roller or a limo.\n\nThis mindset is reflected in the interior ambience taken as a whole – this is a place for relaxed, extremely comfortable transport. It is not, like the bi g Benz, a substitute for a small aircraft – a way, in Germany at least, to make that 100-mile commute in well under an hour.\n\nThe LS 430 is very satisfying, if not inspiring, to the driver. It carries out orders unflinchingly and with the insouciant ease of a practiced manservant. The feel borders on the American conception of luxury, neither demanding the degree of driver involvement nor rewarding it in the same way the German cars do (thinking here of the S Class as well as the 7-Series BMW and Audi A8).\n\nI suppose you could say that while it’s nearly as able as they are, it doesn’t make as big a deal about it. Plus, with its lavish applications of extreme-quality materials – wood, leather and suede – it is more like a living room than a cockpit. So the choice among the high-end temptations comes down to a matter of taste. I, for one, prefer to feel a bit more in the loop, but at the same time, when driving this high-end stuff, am generally frustrated by the conditions imposed on their usage by our legal (viz., speed limit) constraints.\n\nThe LS 430 is electronically governed to 131 mph for political reasons and to allow them to get away with more-compliant “H” rated tires. But even 131 would dig you into a very deep hole here in the U.S.\n\nBetter you should get your thrills sprinting from 0-60 in a few ticks over 6 seconds in an elegant, dignified machine that weighs two tons empty.\n\nThe engine is equipped with a variable-valve mechanism that spreads the torque over a wide range of rpms, with the peak – 320 foot-pounds – coming at a lowly 3,400 rpm. Horsepower peaks at a snarling 5,600, well before the 6,350 redline. Lexus has let horsepower take a back seat to the more usable torque number, although 290 horses constitute an impressive stable.\n\nThe oats will be in the form of 91-octane, of course. The EPA estimates the LS 430’s hunger at 18 mpg city, 25 highway. Driving it more like a sports car, I measured a consumption of 23.3 in mostly rapid-shifting circumstances.\n\nThe car is rear-drive, so it’s quite possible to get some wheelspin with excessive throttle application, but standard features include a not-overly-aggressive traction control system to keep smoking to a minimum.\n\nThe LS 430 also has those emergent musts, Vehicle Skid Control and Brake Assist.\n\nThe former should actually be named yaw control; using accelerometers and sundry other sensors, it communicates with a microprocessor which has been programmed to determine whether, at any given instant, the driver – as measured by the direction in which the front wheels are pointed – is asking for a more-rapid turn than the vehicle – as gauged by the relative speeds of the four wheels – is capable of supplying. If so, the microprocessor wins, and calls for a bit of braking on the appropriate wheel. If that style of intervention is insufficient, it also has the authority to cut power.\n\nThis is one of the best implementations I’ve experienced. I had to get far beyond the reasonable envelope of lateral Gs to sense the power reduction (this by keeping the throttle depressed while turning sharply), and the earlier tapping of the brakes was insensible.\n\nSpeaking of brakes – let us speak in reverent tones. Good-sized discs front and rear produce deceleration which belies the mass. The Brake Assist gizmo senses an unusually rapid and forceful stomp on the brake pedal and shaves a few milliseconds from the time otherwise required to go to full actuation. In a panic situation, that might shave a crucial few feet from the stopping distance.\n\nThe tester even had the optional chrome wheels and “W”-rated performance tires – good for 168 mph – stiffer, and, with 17-inch diameter and 225/55 profile, offering a bit more contact patch t han the standard 225/60/16s. Even so, ride quality was superb, with harshness-filtering particularly notable.\n\nThe audio system was grand, and just as impressive were the high-intensity-discharge headlamps, which shone a beam worthy of such a capable zoomer.\n\nThat big package includes ultrasonic parking indicators, both visual and audible, a nice touch, but not utterly necessary given the relatively compact size of the car and the decent sightlines.\n\nThis is the first I’ve seen of the laser-assisted cruise control. By measuring the distance and closing speed relative to the vehicle ahead, it can override the cruise control as needed.\n\nI must admit, I find cruise control per se rather unnerving when there’s any other traffic; this deal is absolutely spooky. I’m not ready to relinquish control of so vital a function to a splinter of silicon. Bad enough all those air bags – front, side and front/rear curtains – are sitting there ready to explode without my say-so.\n\nOne last plaudit: The LS 430 has an extraordinarily low drag coefficient of 0.26 (0.25 with air suspension), which contributes to the hushed atmosphere at any sane speed.\n\nThe feds have no en able to bring themselves to smash an LS430 yet, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has. The car got top marks in every category and was called a “best pick” in the large luxury category, as were archrival Mercedes’ smaller car, the E Class (no test data for S Class, but one would assume . . . ) and Lincoln’s LS, BMW 5 Series and several others. That’s one argument for spending the big bucks.\n\nIn addition to the mega-package, the tester had upgraded leather interior trim ($2,100), the tires/wheels mentioned ($1,800), and two other noxious nicks: a $41 trunk mat and $47 wheel locks. C’mon, Toyota, give a sucker a break. All that abandon led to the $71,453 bottom line. Payments on such would be $1,449, assuming 20 percent down (which would be the tab for a decent subcompact), 10 percent financing and 48 coupons. You might point out to your spouse that Lexi hold their value well.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Lexus flagship LS 430 boasts 6-speed transmission, clubby interior\n\nWhen Lexus, the upscale division of Japanese automaker Toyota, set out to restyle its flagship LS 430 luxury sedan, it hoped to draw even more men into the fold. The plan apparently has worked — at least judging from the male side of this duo.\n\nThe new LS 430 has such new details as exposed dual exhaust tailpipes, more dramatically sculpted headlights and the first-time availability of 18-inch wheels with low-profile tires. It doesn’t get an engine change, but it now boasts a performance-enhancing six-speed automatic transmission, which replaces a five-speed unit.\n\nWhile the LS 430 has a base price of $55,125, our test vehicle cost $70,380 — largely due to the addition of an $11,320 options package which included a Mark Levinson audio/navigation system, air suspension, and front-and-rear climate-control seats.\n\nAnita was less enthusiastic about the revamped LS 430 after the power trunk closer developed a taste for her fake nails.\n\nHE: I think I’m gonna hate myself in the morning for saying this, but the LS 430 may be my favorite Lexus. Maybe it’s just a sign of encroaching old age, but I feel right at home behind the wheel. If it were my money, I’d probably spend it on a Jaguar, but I have to say that I like the Lexus a whole lot better than other luxury competitors like the BMW 7-Series and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The LS 430’s leather- and wood-trimmed cabin has the ambience of an exclusive men’s club or a great library. You just want to settle in that spacious seat behind the steering wheel and stay there for a good long time. It makes me almost regret that I gave up cigars and brandy. The LS 430 is one of the most sophisticated-looking competitors in a very tough segment of the market. And, frankly, I don’t understand why you aren’t raving about it.\n\nSHE: You mean outside of the fact that I could never reach the massive door to shut it once I got behind the wheel? Or that the steering wheel felt too big? Or that the styling seemed less men’s club and more stodgy to me? Oh, and the fact that it cost me 50 bucks to get my nails fixed after I got them crunched in the power trunk closer? I don’t know what I did wrong. I popped the trunk with the remote key fob and the top came up slightly. I went to give it a boost up and it came down on my left hand. I still don’t know how I managed to squeeze it out of there. I got a lot of sympathy once I made it over to the salon, though.\n\nHE: Obviously, the Lexus isn’t idiot-proof. You probably should have read the owner’s manual before you tried fiddling with anything.\n\nSHE: Forget about the cigars. Have you heard the expression “Put a pipe in it?”\n\nHE: Gee, with throwaway lines like that, you could rent yourself out as a plumber’s friend. Since we’re getting technical, let’s talk nuts and bolts. I’m a big fan of the standard adaptive fro nt lighting system — headlights that turn in the direction of the steering wheel. It’s a great feature that really improves your nighttime vision. We had the optional “smart access” system that allows the driver to unlock and start the car simply by touching the door handle, if the key fob is in your pocket. And the optional navigation system now integrates Bluetooth wireless technology, which allows passengers to make hands-free phone calls through the system’s touch-screen control panel. I’m just not sure that a lot of buyers are going to swallow that $11,320 price tag on the Ultra Luxury options package that includes a lot of those high-tech features.\n\nSHE: I give Lexus credit for including a lot of standard features on the restyled LS 430. New for 2004 are standard knee air bags for the driver and front passenger, along with side air curtains and bigger side air bags. That’s a cut above such products as the new Volkswagen Phaeton, which surprisingly lacks knee air bags. We probably should note that despite all the upgrades in the ’04 model, Lexus uses the same 4.3-liter double-overhead-cam V-8 engine that powered the 2003 model. So don’t expect any change in the horsepower department or in the fuel-economy numbers.\n\nHE: Yes, but with the help of that new six-speed transmission, the 430 now can accelerate from 0-60 in 5.9 seconds, compared to 6.3 seconds for the 2003 model. If that doesn’t thrill you, honey, you can hop in the back seat of the LS 430. The goodies in that $11,000 options package extend to the rear compartment, where you can enjoy adjustable seats that can be heated or cooled, swivel-type reading lamps and sunshades on the doors. You can sit there and recover the next time you get your fingers stuck where they shouldn’t have been in the first place.",

      "expert_review": "Luxury’s Missing Ingredients\n\nWith options, the price topped $70,000. But it didn’t feel like a $70,000 car, and that was my problem with the Ultra Luxury version of the 2006 Lexus LS 430 sedan.\n\nSeventy-thousand bucks is heady territory, a place where buyers expect more than fine quality and reliability, long the hallmarks of the Lexus Division and its parent company, Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nCertainly, buyers of $70,000 cars expect comfortable rear seats. They should be able to ferry fussy family members and friends without hearing gripes about the back seats being “too small,” or being “nicely upholstered, but a pain in the. . . .”\n\nI heard such complaints from rear-seat passengers on different road trips through the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.\n\nI heard it from people with big and small bottoms, from folks old and young, male and female. I heard it so much, I decided to sit back there myself — but not for more than 20 miles. They were right.\n\nThe leather was perfect. The stitching was impeccable. But the Lexus LS 430’s rear seats and my rear end were in constant disagreement.\n\nThe bottom-oriented discord brought this query from my wife: “Are you sure this is a $70,000 car?”\n\nI was sure. I had the sticker and all related pricing information. The base price was $56,525. The price as tested was $71,590, including $13,570 for the “Ultra Luxury” package “with Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,” $800 for the “SP Euro-tuned Sport Suspension w/18-inch wheels,” and a $695 destination charge.\n\nBut competition and technology have changed our perception of luxury.\n\nTake those rear seats. More comfortable seating can be found in a Buick Lucerne or in a Lincoln Town Car for substantially less money. I’ve driven both, and have ridden in both as a rear-seat passenger. I find it almost impossible to sit in the rear seat of a Lincoln Town Car for more than five miles without falling into a deep, pleasant sleep. I should have that same level of comfort in a car costing $21,000 more.\n\nAutomotive savants may argue that the Lexus LS 430 is technically superior to the rivals I’ve mentioned. For example, there’s the Lexus-trademarked Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, which helps the LS 430 driver avoid bumping into the car ahead. There’s the rear-view camera, traction and stability control. The list of the car’s technological goodies is seemingly endless.\n\nSo what?\n\nVersions of the same technologies can be found in numerous other cars at lower prices. Consider General Motors Corp.\n\nBeneath all of the opprobrium heaped upon General Motors is a GM truth that I’ve come to appreciate: The electronic gadgets installed in GM cars usually work exactly the way they were intended to work. They are simple, intuitive and highly functional. I have never had an electronic GM key fob that failed. But the key fob accompanying the LS 430 did. It failed to open the trunk; and it worked erratically for the side doors.\n\nAnd there is this: Children nowadays expect a car wearing a luxury label to have rear video entertainment as standard equipment. They carry video screens in their pockets and book bags. They have them in their classrooms, and in their bedrooms at home. They have them in their Honda, GM, Ford and Nissan minivans. They expect to find them in a flagship Lexus car.\n\nBut the lone video screen in the LS 430 was the navigation screen in the front cabin; and that didn’t cut it with the younger set.\n\n“Where’s the DVD screen?” asked godson Kyo.\n\n“There’s only one screen,” I said, pointing to the navigation module.\n\n“That’s it? Really?” Kyo asked. “This is a Lexus?”\n\nI assured him that it was.\n\nHe didn’t believe me.\n\n“We have a DVD player in our [Honda Odyssey] minivan,” he said with the kind of sarcasm that can only issue from the mouth of an 11-year-old.\n\nNuts & Bolts Lexus LS 430\n\nDownside: The rear seats are uncomfortable. But that isn’t why I think the Ultra Luxury Lexus LS 430 is overpriced. It’s because the car world has grown more competitive, with many cars offering similar amenities found in the tested LS 430 for less. I mean, heck, this one didn’t even have a rear DVD screen. Harrumph!\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: The LS 430 has excellent acceleration and superior handling. From the driver’s seat, the car is an absolute joy, especially when its electronic suspension is set on the “Sport” mode. Unfortunately, not one of the nine passengers who rode in the car’s rear cabin on various trips enjoyed the ride. Not one!\n\nHead-turning quotient: Nearly everybody mistook the Lexus LS 430 for an S-Class Mercedes-Benz. That may be flattering to Mercedes-Benz, but it does little to establish an independent LS 430 identity.\n\nBody style/layout: The Lexus LS 430 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, large luxury sedan with a traditional notchback trunk.\n\nEngine/transmission: The Lexus LS 430 comes with a standard 4.3-liter V-8 engine that develops 278 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 312 foot-pounds of torque at 3,400 rpm. The engine is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: The Lexus LS 430 has seating for five people. Maximum luggage capacity is 20.2 cubic feet. Fuel capacity is 22.2 gallons of gasoline. Premium unleaded is required.\n\nMileage: I averaged 24 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving.\n\nSafety: Pre-collision system that automatically tightens safety belts, increases braking pressure and takes other defensive electronic measures to lessen the severity of an impending crash; Dynamic Radar Cruise Control; ventilated disc brakes front and rear; traction and stability control; side air bags, and head air bags for front and rear passengers.\n\nPrice: The Lexus LS 430 has a base price of $56,525. Dealer’s invoice price on the base model is $49,176. Price as tested is $71,590, including a total of $14,370 in options and a $695 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $61,423. Prices sourced from Lexus and http://www.edmunds.com .\n\nPurse-strings note: The Lexus LS 430 is an overall fine luxury car with many worthy, less-expensive competitors. Compare with Acura RL (V-6 engine but more horsepower and better fuel economy than the LS 430); Audi A8; Infiniti Q45; and Cadillac STS V-8.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to luxury vehicles, Lexus is now king of the heap.\n\nSurpassing all others in sales, the Japanese automaker has clearly climbed the most profitable of mountains to become leaders in the field. Most of this has come at the lower end of the price scale, with the majority of sales coming from cars such as the ES300 and IS300, both of which have sticker prices in the low-to-mid 30s. Trucks have also helped pushed Lexus past such traditional luxury leaders as Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Lincoln.\n\nBut Cadillac still sells more DeVilles than Lexus sells LS430s, so Lexus is always trying to polish its crown jewel even more. Like other automakers, Lexus is using high-tech toys to distance itself from the pack.\n\nIt’s certainly the most remarkable part of the LS430, with gadgets that will amuse and delight otherwise bored and distracted drivers. Here’s what Lexus packs into the LS430:\n\nLaser Guided Cruise Control: A laser collects inputs from 630 points. It senses how close a vehicle is in front of the LS430 and adjusts the cruise control accordingly.\n\nParking Assist: Ultrasonic sensors sound when parking the LS430 too close to another vehicle.\n\nPower door closers: Didn’t quite get that door shut all the way? Small motors close the door tightly for you.\n\nSeats: A bit wide and flat, they adjust 14 ways on the driver’s side, 10 on the passenger’s side.\n\nRear seat adjustments: Rear passengers can not only recline their seats, they can also warm them or use the massage feature to ease their aching back muscles. Rear seat passengers also get their own automatic climate control system with air filtration, just like front-seat passengers. If that doesn’t do the trick, rear sunshades will.\n\nFront audio: Lexus now features Mark Levinson audio systems. The sound is incredibly accurate, as if the musicians are playing right there in the seat next to you. If you’ve never heard the name, you’re either not an audiophile or you can’t afford this systems. It contains not just an in-dash 6-CD changer, but also a single-slot CD player. Nice touch.\n\nRear audio: If they get bored with the front-seat passenger’s Montovanni CDs, rear seaters get their own radio, so they can listen to Korn.\n\nRear cooler: Thirsty? A small cooler just behind the rear armrest will hold a few cans of your favorite beverage.\n\nAir suspension: This is the reason the ride of the Lexus LS430 is positively cloud-like.\n\nDVD-Navigation System: With a 7-inch screen, Lexus’ detailed map is one of the best available. It uses voice commands so you don’t have to fiddle with the controls while driving.\n\nOther: All the standard luxury gear is here, including automatic dual climate control with outside air filtration, 3-position memory for the driver’s seat, steering wheel and seatbelt anchor height, trip computer, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, heated outside auto-dimming mirrors, automatic headlamps with washers, keyless entry, power trunk, programma ble garage door openers, anti-theft system, outside temperature gauge and boatloads of leather and wood.\n\nAll of this seems more important than the performance, although that’s none too shabby.The 4.3-liter V-8 makes a sufficiently powerful 290 horsepower and 320 pound-feet of torque and is mated to a computer controlled five-speed automatic transmission. This is enough to move the car from 0-60 in a factory-claimed 6.3 seconds.\n\nThe car feels quick and eerily smooth off the line. Credit goes to what Lexus calls Intuitive Powertrain Control. A computer analyzes how much pressure you’re putting on the accelerator and compares that against engine speed and vehicle speed. Meanwhile the transmission’s computer analyzes road grade and transmission shifting and the entire drivetrain works in concert to give the right amount of engine power and the right gear. It all works seamlessly, so there’s never a feeling that the car is in the wrong gear.\n\nThe car feels soft and serene, like best Cadillac that Cadillac doesn’t build.\n\nThe styling is the same bland pseudo-Mercedes line that Lexus has used from the beginning. It’s not overly memorable or distinct, but it is conservative and handsome.\n\nThe fit and finish of the car is outstanding, with a gem-like polish that makes you feel that you’re getting your money’s worth, even at this lofty price level. The most outstanding example is the ultrasuede headliner, which finishes off the thoroughly post-modern feel of the cabin.\n\nFor the driving enthusiast, there’s not much that’s exciting here. The driving experience is not memorable in the extreme. For the driver who views driving as something to be endured, you’ll adore this vehicle. It makes driving life absolutely painless. At the end of a long day, this is a car that soothes you, not enlivens you.\n\nFor most drivers, that’s the ultimate luxury. And that’s what’s made Lexus and the LS430 the king of the heap.",
