Rear-drive RC 350s use an eight-speed automatic transmission while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Cadillac ATS.\n\nThe RC 350 was later joined by the RC F, a rear-drive performance model with a V-8 engine. The RC F is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2016\nTwo new engines expand the RC lineup. The RC 200t is powered by a 241-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder while the RC 300 has a 255-hp version of the RC 350’s 3.5-liter V-6. The RC 200t comes with rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic, and the RC 300 comes with all-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic. The F Sport versions of the RC 200t and rear-drive RC 350 now offer optional orange brake calipers and a limited-slip differential.\n\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nLED headlights and running lights\nHeated side mirrors\nKeyless entry with push-button start\nAutomatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\n60/40-split folding backseat\nBluetooth streaming audio\nCD stereo with 7-inch dashboard screen and USB/iPod connectivity\nBackup camera\nSafety Connect emergency communication system with one-year trial subscription\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n241-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (RC 200t)\n255-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (RC 300)\n306-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (RC 350)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (rear-wheel drive)\nSix-speed automatic transmission (all-wheel drive)\nNavigation system\nMark Levinson surround-sound audio system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBlind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert\nPrecollision system with adaptive cruise control\nMoonroof\nAdaptive suspension (F Sport)",
