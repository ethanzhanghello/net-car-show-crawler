      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLexus redesigned its midlevel GS sedan for 2013, adopting the corporate grille that’s made its way across the CT 200h hatchback and refreshed LX SUV. The brand says V-8 engines are a dying choice among midsize luxury cars, so it dropped the option for this generation. That leaves the hybrid GS 450h as the top choice, with a V-6 hybrid system rated at 338 combined horsepower. Below the 450h slots the GS 350, which has the outgoing car’s 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional on the GS 350. Competitors to the GS include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Cadillac CTS.Exterior\nThe GS is less than an inch longer and wider than its predecessor, but overall height is up 1.2 inches in rear-wheel-drive models and 1.4 inches for all-wheel-drive cars. Lexus’ new “spindle” grille looks more like a squat hourglass, pinched at its upper opening but widening to encompass a second opening below. All told, the new GS looks identifiably Lexus, but it drops the quad headlights the car has had for two generations. In back, the taillights adopt L-shaped LEDs. Dual tailpipes send exhaust through bumper-integrated openings.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels and xenon headlights with LED daytime running lamps are standard. Eighteen-inch wheels are optional. An optional F-Sport Package adds 19-inch alloys and high-performance summer tires on rear-wheel-drive cars, with all-seasons on all-wheel-drive F-Sport models. The package also adds a unique front bumper and ground effects around the side and rear, plus unique grille inserts and a slight rear spoiler.\n\nInterior\nThe GS’ dashboard places a broad, high shelf below the windshield, with stitched upholstery lining much of it. The standard dash display measures 8 inches. An optional 12.3-inch display can show music, navigation and climate info.\n\nBackseat passengers can have their own automatic climate zone, plus heated outboard seats. Other luxury options include heated and ventilated front seats, manual rear-window sunshades, upgraded leather upholstery and a navigation system. Lexus’ optional Enform multimedia system incorporates apps like Pandora, Facebook Places and Microsoft’s Bing search engine off a tethered smartphone.\n\nCargo volume totals 14.3 cubic feet in the GS 350, up from 12.7 cubic feet in the last GS. The GS 450h, whose battery back sits astern of the rear seat, has 13.2 cubic feet of room.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GS 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 makes 306 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque. Lexus says the GS 350’s six-speed automatic shifts more quickly than before, and EPA gas mileage improves to 19/28 mpg city/highway, compared with the last GS 350’s 19/26 mpg. The all-wheel-drive GS 350 is EPA-rated at 19/26 mpg, up 1 mpg over the previous all-wheel-drive GS 350.\n\nThe GS’ suspension includes a redesigned multilink setup in back; an adaptive suspension is optional. Lexus Drive Mode Selector adapts drivetrain and in-car settings to four modes: Eco, Normal, Sport S and Sport S+. The latter comes with the optional adaptive suspension. Besides stiffening the suspension, Sport S+ dials back intervention from the GS’ standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe GS 450h uses a 3.5-liter V-6 that runs on a more efficient Atkinson cycle. With help from an electric motor, the 450h is EPA-rated at 29/34 mpg, some 35 percent better than the GS 350 and prior GS 450h. It compares well to Infiniti’s M35h hybrid (27/32 mpg) and Mercedes-Benz’s E400 hybrid (an estimated 24/31 mpg). As of this writing, the EPA has yet to announce mileage figures for BMW’s ActiveHybrid 5 Series.\n\nLexus says the rear-drive GS 350 hits 60 mph in 5.7 seconds (6 seconds with all-wheel drive), while the GS 450h does it in 5.6 seconds. The figures reflect a quicker car than Mercedes’ V-6 E350 and roughly match BMW’s six-cylinder 535i, but don’t expect the GS to mimic a V-8 sedan. The 550i and E550, both eight-cylinder cars, hit 60 mph significantly sooner.Safety\nStandard safety features include 10 airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. All four outboard seats have seat-belt pretensioners, versus the typical front-only pretensioners. Lexus’ optional collision warning system monitors the driver’s eyes for signs of distraction; it can warn you earlier if a collision looms while you’re looking away. Night vision, a head-up display, blind spot warning and lane departure warning and mitigation systems are also optional.",

      "expert_review": "I am a Lexus driver.\n\nI can pass on the right, run stop signs and double park at will. I slow for animals and my kid always gets straight A’s, according to my bumper.\n\nYellow lights mean speed up and those 70 mph signs on the side of the road are only suggestions. Rules do not apply to me. I am a Lexus driver.\n\nSo must be the creed of the drivers of America’s No. 1 selling luxury brand. While I have no statistical data to support my theory that Lexus drivers collectively exhibit the worst roadside manners in the U.S., I have plenty of anecdotal evidence: The Lexus driver on her cell phone in California who nearly ran me off the road in Westwood. The South Florida Lexus driver on his cell phone using the emergency lane to bypass traffic. Other Lexus drivers cutting me off, tailgating me or the never even seeing me.\n\nSomehow, Lexus can take a nice guy and transform him into Mad Max.\n\nWould it happen to me, I wondered, as I prepared to test the 2009 GS 450h. This vehicle had the double potential to make me believe the roads come with a “Scott only” lane. First, there was the L on the trunk; and second, there was blue around the L, meaning this sedan is a hybrid. This would allow me to cut off a Chrysler minivan and then feel contempt for the owner in that he-just-doesn’t-know-any-better way.\n\nJumping into the leather bucket seat, I relaxed and checked the turn signals. Yes, they worked just fine. I wondered why I’ve rarely see them used by Lexus drivers changing lanes on the open road.\n\nPushing the start button, I sat quietly in the car. All of the lights and stereo turned on, but no engine. I pushed the start button again and everything switched off. Ugh, this is a hybrid, I reminded myself; the engine doesn’t always rumble awake when you hop into it (it can propel itself by silent electric power).\n\nBut it didn’t take long to begin to understand a Lexus driver’s indifference to the outside world. You’re literally the center of the universe when you sit behind the three-spoke wheel of the GS 450h. Luxury bathes you in plush smells and gentle lighting. Open the door and a spot light shines on the driver’s seat: Tada — welcome! It might as well applause upon your arrival or pop flashes of light as you near, your own personal paparazzi.\n\nThe world only enters through the programmable satellite radio. (If the standard 10-speaker stereo isn’t enough, there’s the optional Mark Levinson 14-speaker surround sound system that’s better than front row symphony tickets.)\n\nNo other sounds penetrate the GS 450h. The ride is silently smooth. Even if the gas engine starts, it gently purrs like a kitten in your lap. (Lexus fills the engine mounts with fluid that reduce vibrations in the cabin.) The 10-way adjustable seat, telescoping and tilting steering wheel allow you to create a driving position like no other. It’s a custom-fitted suit with a smog sensor (which automatically shuts off the outside vents if it detects a bad air day).\n\nThe Black birds-eye maple wood trim accents the dash and doors in an old European kind of way. You are king or at least royalty. Your every whim is catered to in the Lexus. There’s even a stable of 340 collective horses under the hood from the 3.5-liter V-6 and electric motor to whisk your carriage to the ball.\n\nThe Lexus GS 450h is not a car, it’s a decadent lifestyle. I had it wrong, Lexus drivers aren’t bad at all. They’re spoiled in a way we all want to be.\n\nThe GS 450h begins at $56,400 and goes up from there. The hybrid powertrain also enhances performance, but doesn’t seem to help much at the pump. I averaged 24 miles per gallon in mixed driving, which is on par with the EPA rating of 22 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. Naturally, this thoroughbred requires premium fuel.\n\nThe hybrid system does enhance the car’s abilities, though I question mixing performance with hybrid vehicles. Honda attempted this with its Accord and the car never caught on. The GS 450h may run into a similar wall. Consumers see the word hybrid and expect high mileage. Performance is secondary.\n\nBut the GS 450h is quick, sneaky quick. It hits 60 mph from a stop in 5.2 seconds and often tops 80 mph without the driver even knowing it.\n\nIt’s easy to get distracted in this car. There’s Bluetooth phone connectivity, obviously for important calls from your broker or the Prince of Bel Air. There’s heated and cooled seats, a navigation system that doesn’t require to you sign a legal waiver every time you turn it on. The center stack delicately pushes out from the dash, and I noticed the fancy cassette deck at the bottom. I would have to guess it is a premium cassette player, with auto reverse and everything. Now, if only I could find cassettes to play in it.\n\nBut that’s one of the few things I found wrong with this well-built machine. The suspension was taut but not tight. Of course, it’s completely adjustable. The GS 450h comes with an adaptive variable suspension, which allows the driver to tighten or loosen the ride. The tightest setting did not feel remarkably tight. The car stayed well planted on the road.\n\nThe rear wheel drive kept this sedan fun, though on one snowy day, the electronic stability control wanted to shut off the rear axle too soon. (That’s why there’s a hybrid snow button on the center console. That helps the tires spin a little in the snow, but the system felt too sensitive even then.)\n\nThis is a driver’s car for the driver who doesn’t want to push his abilities. If having the hybrid badge scores you points at the Sierra Club, then by all means, consider it.\n\nThe car’s graceful lines will score points with almost anyone. The low roofline sweeps toward the back gently — allowing this sedan to offer headroom in the back while maintaining a sleek look. Every time you walk up to this car, it reaffirms your importance in a staid, confident manner. You’re important because the keys to this car are in your hand.\n\nEvery brand carries a certain attitude. Chevy means one thing while Lamborghini means something different. That’s half the fun of testing these machines.\n\nWhile I initially thought it was the drivers who were tarnishing the Lexus brand, I realized that it’s Lexus that creates these self-important drivers.\n\nOf course, they don’t pay attention to traffic rules — the Lexus makes you oblivious to them — 70 mph or 90 mph, it all feels the same. The insanely quite ride means you don’t hear the rumble strips as the tires roll across.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with a car spoiling the driver. I only wish they’d think about using their turn signals from time to time. They work just fine.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "There are cars that are built to haul families and cars that can accommodate families. The 2010 Lexus GS 450h is one of the latter. It’s a hybrid sports sedan that’s built for performance and the driving experience, but it won’t complain too loudly if you toss a couple of kids in the backseat. Just try not to spill the Cheerios, m’kay?\n\nThe GS 450h seems strangely conflicted, as if it doesn’t really know what it wants to be. The hybrid system gives the GS plenty of speed, but a typically soft Lexus suspension absorbs the road feel. That’s lovely and peaceful for the passengers, but the lack of rear legroom is decidedly not. It’s a hybrid, but it’s faster than the V-8 version of the GS. The car is confused; I’m confused. At least my kids knew what they thought of the GS 450h: They were unimpressed.\n\nThe driving experience in the GS 450h is an odd one. It begins with disquieting acceleration that’s devoid of engine roar. While there’s plenty of power to be had, there’s no quick jump off the starting line, as with a traditional gas engine. It can run on purely electric power but only at low speeds. It’s super quiet on the road, not only because of the hybrid system, but because the GS is solidly built, with heavy doors and tons of soundproofing. The only really jumpy thing in the GS is the regenerative brakes, which were surprisingly sensitive.\n\nThe 2010 Lexus GS 450h begins at $57,450. My test vehicle was priced at $62,470.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe GS is, by far, the best looking of the Lexus sedans. It is sleek and elegant, with plenty of personality. The grille has been slightly redesigned for 2010, but it still looks familiar and very Lexus-y. The headlights angle away from the center grille, with a large Lexus badge in the middle of it. Subtle sculpting along the hood echoes the grille, while bolder lines reach back from the lights. It creates a wider, bolder face and gives this Lexus an edge that’s missing from some of its lineup.\n\nIn the front and along the sides, chrome wraps nearly everything, bringing plenty of sparkle without becoming gaudy. Chrome can be found on the headlights, grille, windows and the bottom of the doors. Somehow, the door handles escaped the chrome treatment, but I think it was for the best. It’s a fine line.  The roof is rounded, leaning back from the hood, creating a sense of movement, even when the GS is parked.\n\nGetting in and out of the five-seater was easier for the kids than it was for me. The GS sits fairly low to the ground and I’m not graceful. The ceiling is also on the low side, so I had to watch my head on the way in. The doors are heavy and close with a “thunk.” They may be slightly unwieldy for little ones. My guys handled the doors without a problem, but they’re half grown.\n\nNew for 2010, the hybrid system got a few tweaks, making it more efficient than ever. The GS has a 292-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that uses premium gas. It also has two electric motors – one starts the gas engine and the other boosts acceleration – that give the GS a combined 340 hp. The GS 450h gets an EPA-estimated 22/25 mpg city/highway, but I, in what has become typical fashion, never hit those numbers. During my week in the GS, I averaged 19.5 mpg. This is due to the combination of hauling a fairly heavy car up and down hills all day and my complete disregard for economical driving practices.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe GS 450h’s interior, especially the front seat, is luxurious, comfortable and very masculine. The heated and cooled leather seats with power adjustments embraced and supported me like a fantasy. I just sunk into them. Then I realized I couldn’t see out of the windows, so I readjusted the seat and found that visibility isn’t great in this sedan.\n\nIt’s very dark inside the GS, even with the standard sunroof. There’s lots of black leather and a black dash with black insets. The interior’s only color comes from wood trim on the steering wheel and center console that’s in a shade of cherry. It actually seemed more of a grenadine color than actual fruit or wood for that matter.\n\nThere’s plenty of technological wonders in the GS, from a large LCD touch-screen that offers navigation, audio and climate controls to the Bluetooth system that not only makes phone calls hands-free but also streams music from an MP3 player. Though there are USB and auxiliary inputs, the USB system was so slow and clumsy that using Bluetooth to stream music made much more sense. What didn’t make any sense were the GS’ two ashtrays, complete with cigarette lighters. At least when my kids asked me what they were we had an excellent conversation about the dangers of smoking.\n\nStorage seemed to be at a minimum, with a decent-size dual-level bin in the center console. There are no additional cubbies or bins anywhere. There are two cupholders in the front row and two more in the backseat’s armrest. The door bins are narrow and don’t have bottleholders, and I couldn’t manage to stuff anything in there but papers. During my test drive, the front passenger seat was often occupied with clutter.\n\nThere isn’t a whole lot of room in the backseat, either, as legroom is fairly limited. There was enough room for my kids, and adults can sit back there, but they won’t be able to stretch out.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n \nSAFETY\n\nThe GS comes with Lexus’ Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management System standard. Through it, all of its multiple safety features talk to each other, working together to keep the GS on the road and heading in the right direction. Those standard safety features include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe GS also has 10 airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front and rear seats, side curtains for both rows and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger. It also has standard adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of a turn. Lexus also offers a one-year trial subscription of its Safety Connect, which automatically alerts the authorities of a collision and comes with an emergency assist button as well as stolen vehicle tracking.\n\nAdaptive cruise control is available. This safety feature can sense impending collisions and alert the driver to it.\n\nIn the backseat, the seat belts are placed rather high and don’t fit smaller kids well. The buckles are recessed and can be hard to reach for little hands. My son’s booster seat wouldn’t sit flat on the rear seat, and the booster seat kept sliding over the recessed seat belt buckle. The poor guy struggled with it every time we got in the car.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the GS. While they’re visible, they aren’t easy to reach. I had to slide the front passenger seat forward to get a rear-facing infant-safety seat to fit in the backseat. A convertible seat fits just fine.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Lexus GS 450h here.",

      "expert_review": "A hybrid is not solely about maximum fuel economy. The Lexus GS 450h is a mixture of performance and economy that keeps driving fun without guzzling gas.\n\nKey to the GS 450h is the way Lexus combines a 3.5-liter V-6 engine with a compact, permanent magnet electric motor that drives the rear wheels. The hybrid powertrain collectively produces 340 horsepower and accelerates from zero to 60 in just 5.2 seconds.\n\nBecause an electric motor delivers its maximum torque immediately, the GS 450h powertrain delivers strong midrange acceleration that is most useful in the 30-to-50-mph range.\n\nI nailed the throttle on a highway entrance ramp, and the hybrid’s surge of power launched the car into traffic like a slingshot. The continuously variable transmission doesn’t have conventional gear shifts, so the engine maintains a rather constant hum as the car goes faster and faster. The feeling can be mildly disconcerting at first, but it feels quite natural after a few minutes.\n\nThe hybrid GS returns nearly 30 percent better fuel efficiency than some V-8 models with comparable performance. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates fuel economy at 25 miles per gallon in the city and 28 on the highway. The hybrid is certified as a Super-Low Emissions Vehicle.\n\nWhile the hybrid performs like a regular car, it doesn’t drive exactly like one. When you turn the key, there is no sound because the gasoline engine isn’t running. The car initially moves under electric power, and the gasoline engine kicks in as speeds move past a crawl. The gasoline engine often shuts off while you’re stopped, too, but it restarts in an instant.\n\nRegenerative braking charges the batteries.\n\nThe hybrid GS starts at $54,900, and the test car had a sticker price of $60,149.\n\nAll models have heated and cooled leather seats, keyless ignition, dual-zone climate control, heated outside mirrors, premium 10-speaker stereo, high-intensity headlamps, side-curtain and knee airbags, and a leather-and-wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob.\n\nThe cabin of the new GS looks familiar, especially to owners of the previous model, yet it has many new features. The gauges have dark metallic faces. A unique lighting system uses variable transparency glass to optimize visibility in a wide variety of lighting conditions.\n\nA small panel that folds into the left side of the dash contains buttons that are not used every day, such as those for adjusting the outside mirrors or opening the trunk. This adds simplicity to the dash, but it requires an extra step if you need to adjust the mirrors or open the trunk.\n\nAn LCD screen dominates the center stack, and it is used to control the audio system, set temperatures and view the map on the navigation system.\n\nDynamically, the GS has athletic handling without resorting to a ride that is overly harsh. The variable suspension provides a firm ride and tight handling.\n\nLexus’ new vehicle stability program, called VDIM, integrates and manages the brakes, steering, traction control, electronic throttle and variable gear ratio steering. Lexus press materials say that VDIM is able to “monitor a variety of sensors throughout the vehicle and help correct the situation with a combination of braking, throttle and steering control in a way that is transparent to the driver.”\n\nPrice The base price of the GS 450h is $54,900. Options on the test car included the navigation system, Mark Levinson stereo, run-flat tires and rear trunk spoiler. The sticker price was $60,149.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles. The powertrain is covered for six years or 70,000 miles, and the hybrid battery and components are covered for eight years or 100,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Lexus GS 450h hybrid sport sedan emphasizes performance over fuel efficiency, with its gasoline engine and hybrid motors combining to make 340 horsepower, which about matches the 342-hp V-8 engine in the GS 460. The GS 450h has no hybrid competitors. The hybrid is a smidge faster than the GS 460. Lexus says the GS 450h can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, while the GS 460 takes 5.4 seconds. The GS 450h’s combined city/highway gas mileage is 23 mpg. That means it sips gas on par with the V-6-powered GS 350. There’s a more compelling case when it’s compared with the V-8-equipped GS 460, which has a lower combined city/highway estimate.\n\nNew for 2011\nOther GS models added a brake override system for 2011, but it already was standard on the GS 450h.\n\nExterior\nVirtually identical to the GS 350 and GS 460 sedans, the GS 450h sports Lexus’ familiar face with its angular headlights and grille. An adaptive suspension continually senses road conditions to modify damping appropriately. A Sport mode incorporates tighter damping, and an optional active stabilizer system mitigates body roll even more. Exterior features include:\n\nMoonroof\nHigh-intensity-discharge headlights\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nSpecial 18-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nAn electric-power meter replaces the tachometer in the leftmost instrument pod, while a dashboard information screen displays energy consumption statistics and an animation of real-time power routing. Otherwise, the GS 450h’s interior is identical to other GS models, including the cramped backseat. Because of intrusion from the hybrid system’s batteries, trunk volume shrinks. Interior features include:\n\nStandard heated leather seats\nStandard ventilated front seats\nStandard dual-zone automatic climate control\nAvailable electric rear sunshade\nStandard 10-speaker audio system\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable 14-speaker audio system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GS 450h’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine is shared with other Lexus models. Mechanical features include:\n\n3.5-liter V-6 makes 292 hp, not including the electric motors\nV-6 teams with two electric motors — one to start the gas engine, the other to boost acceleration — for a combined 340 hp\nRegenerative braking to charge the batteries for electric motors\nEngine shutoff when car is at a standstill\nCan move solely on electric power during light-load situations\nContinuously variable automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nA full complement of electronic safety features centers around Lexus’ Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management system, which is standard. Safety features include:\n\nElectronic stability system\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic brakes\nAdaptive front lighting system swivels the headlights several degrees during turns to better illuminate corners\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nAvailable adaptive cruise control can sense impending collisions and alert the driver",
