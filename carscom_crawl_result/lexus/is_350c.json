      "expert_review": "I’m just going to come right out and say that the 2010 Lexus IS 350C was the most fun I’ve had in a car in a long time. How could it not be fun? It was a sexy little red convertible with plenty of power and lots of luxury. It also didn’t hurt that Los Angeles was experiencing a heat wave that brought the hottest day in the city’s history while I had a convertible to drive. Suffice it to say, I only put the top up when I parked it for the night. For a week, the wind tousled my hair, my friends were jealous of my glamorous life and I was one hot mama.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive IS 350C is the convertible model of Lexus’ popular IS line. It’s a two-door hardtop that seats four and has a super-fun 3.5-liter V-6 engine. What’s really great about it, though, is that this little number is on the softer side of sporty, with a smoother ride than a true sports car. It’s not meant to go screaming around the track, but it was plenty sporty enough to tempt me into trouble on the highway or twisty mountain roads. Not that I followed that impulse. Of course. I moderately enjoyed the 306 horsepower and six-speed automatic transmission while gently cruising at respectable, mature speeds up hills and through switchbacks and never once found myself getting overexuberant. Ahem.\n\nLiving with kids in this little beauty took some creativity, but we managed. The IS 350C only has room for my kids or my husband, but not both at the same time since the backseat’s legroom is limited. Taking kids to school and running errands was no problem, but the small space left in the trunk when the convertible top was down gave me pause. I also wasn’t in love with the navigation system’s touch-screen controls, but I was having so much fun just driving a convertible with a V-6 that I was willing to overlook it. While the IS 350C isn’t cheap – it starts at $44,890 – fun like this is worth the $49,415 on the sticker of my test car.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2010 IS 350C is one hot, little number, particularly in the Matador Red Mica of my test car. It’s really beautiful, according to everyone I spoke to on the subject. In front, the IS 350C crouches low to the ground, with strong sculpting angling back from the chromed grille to the corners of the windshield. With the top up, the profile is reminiscent of the more expensive SC model. With the top down, the IS looks longer and roomier, even breezier.\n\nThere’s very little chrome on the IS 350C, which is surprising for a Lexus. Only the front grille is wrapped in chrome, leaving the door handles and windows clean. The Lexus badging is also chrome, but aside from that, the IS is sleek and monochromatic. Twin exhaust tips are also chromed.\n\nGetting in and out of the IS 350C is a breeze when the top is down. It’s less so if the top is up, which is another excellent reason to leave the top down. The IS sits fairly low to the ground, so it’s a slide-in-and-down motion to get in it. When the roof is up, even little ones need to watch their heads climbing in. There’s plenty of headroom while seated in front and enough in the back for small folk. The doors are pleasantly solid and not too heavy, but they can be difficult for kids in the backseat to close since it’s a coupe.\n\nThe IS 350C comes with an entertaining 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 306 horsepower. The gas mileage isn’t entertaining, however, with an EPA rating of 18/25 mpg city/highway that I wasn’t able to duplicate with all of my conservative driving. Premium gas is required.\n\n \n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nInside the IS 350C is a world of black leather and metallic-looking trim. Genuine wood trim is optional. The controls are easy to read and close at hand, but Lexus needs to update the navigation system’s clunky touch-screen that dominates the center stack. It requires more of a stab than a touch and gets smudged easily. There are nifty techie features like Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming, satellite radio and navigation. The IS has a USB input, but it’s so slow and clumsy to operate that it’s not worth using except as a way to charge your iPod.\n\nStorage is fairly minimal in the IS 350C. There’s a small center bin that houses the input ports and a charging point. The doors have narrow bins to hold the mail but no bottleholders. The two cupholders work well, however, so I remained fully caffeinated.\n\nThe front seats are comfortably firm, and my test car had the optional heated and cooled seats, as well. As it was more than 100 degrees outside during my test week this was particularly appreciated. Those seats also adjust in 10 ways at the push of a button, and there’s a button on the front passenger head restraint that slides that seat forward and back, making access to the backseat easier.\n\nThe backseat is considerably less comfortable than the front. In fact, I let my 10-year-old sit in the front passenger seat, both to give him more room and because he hated the wind in the backseat when the top was down. His 7-year-old brother sat behind him, but I had to slide the front passenger seat forward an inch or two to give him some much needed legroom. Backpacks were stored on the seat behind me and we were off! The IS 350C only worked for us because my kids are older. If they were still in booster seats or infant seats, we would have been far less thrilled. Still, my boys were comfy enough with twin cupholders and rear vents.\n\nCargo space is also at a minimum. The hardtop folds into the trunk, and there’s not a great deal of space remaining. A nifty shield divides the space, so it’s easy to tell what you have room for and what will require the roof to remain up. When the top is up, the trunk is roomy enough for a major grocery trip or sports gear, but not kids’ bikes or a trip to Ikea.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n \nSAFETY\nMaking things difficult in the IS 350C is how poorly child-safety seats fit in the backseat of this little bundle of fun. Booster seats don’t sit flat in the second row’s two bucket seats, and they’re difficult to buckle as a result. There’s no room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat, but I’d never consider putting an infant in the back of a convertible because of the wind and sun exposure. A forward-facing convertible car seat fit, but there’s little legroom for kids. While the two sets of lower Latch anchors are easy enough to reach, if I had kids in car seats the IS 350C wouldn’t be my car of choice.\n\nVisibility is great in the IS when the top is down, but when it’s up there are some big blind spots. Helpfully, the rear head restraints fold down with a release at the front of the backseats. Also, there’s an optional backup camera that gives a secondary view.\n\nThe IS 350C has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side-impact and knee airbags for the front rows.\n\nBesides the optional backup camera, the IS’ optional safety features include a navigation system, front and rear parking sensors, dynamic cruise control and Lexus Enform with SafetyConnect, which is similar to GM’s OnStar system.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Lexus IS 350C here.",

      "expert_review": "For more than 10 years, Lexus has presented luxury shoppers an unlikely offering in the IS, a rear-wheel-drive sport sedan from a brand best known for cushy comfort. The gamble worked: The IS drives better than most of its Lexus siblings. It does not, however, get there without a penalty.\n\nWhile the Lexus IS sedan performs well, it makes drivers give up ride comfort and roominess in ways that its competitors don’t.\n\nLexus restyled a few elements on the IS for 2011, which you can compare with the 2010 model here. The car comes in IS 250 or IS 350 form, representing the size of each one’s V-6 engine. Both are also available as a convertible, denoted by “C” in the model name. Compare them here. The lineup’s high-performance IS-F sedan is covered separately on Cars.com. All-wheel drive is optional on the IS 250 and 350 sedans; in previous years, it was optional only on the IS 250.\n\nWe evaluated two cars: a rear-wheel-drive IS 250C convertible and an all-wheel-drive IS 350 sedan.\n\nQuick, or Not So Much\nEven carrying an extra 176 pounds of driveline, the all-wheel-drive IS 350 moves out. Lexus’ direct-injection V-6 feels on par with the powerhouse six-cylinders in the BMW 335i and Infiniti G37. It pulls strongly, sounds muscular and can generally overtake slower traffic whenever your right foot desires. Aided by a quick-shifting six-speed automatic, the 306-horsepower IS 350 is a confident beast. One editor thought the automatic shifted a bit harshly sometimes, but most agreed it’s a responsive gearbox — not the usual pedigree from parent company Toyota. Still, I wish the IS 350 had a manual transmission. Most competing sedans offer one with their larger engines. Manuals might not sell well, but having one available would make the IS more attractive to performance enthusiasts.\n\nThe 204-hp IS 250 does offer a stick, and you’ll probably need it to wring the most out of the engine. Our test car’s pint-sized V-6 felt two cylinders short. It reminded me of a Mercedes-Benz C240 — the cheapest six-cylinder Mercedes of its time, discontinued in 2006. Like the old Benz, the IS 250’s oomph from a stop is modest, though it’s better in the drivetrain’s Power mode — activated by a dashboard switch — which noticeably hastens accelerator and transmission response (at some cost to fuel efficiency). With three people inside, our convertible needed the drivetrain’s full reserves to reach highway speed.\n\nLexus quotes a zero-to-60 time of 8.4 seconds for the 250 convertible, which is pokey for a luxury car. Weighing 375 pounds less, the rear-drive IS 250 sedan hits the mark in 7.9 seconds, Lexus says. (Incidentally, that’s not far off the C240, which hit the mark in about 8.2 seconds.) Among today’s entry-level sport sedans, the BMW 328i is quicker, and the turbocharged Audi A4 beats both. Lexus has some catching up to do.\n\nRide & Handling\nAs a group, sport sedans ride firmly, but the IS sedan takes things to an extreme that could turn off many shoppers. Wearing 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires, our IS 350 sedan picked up all sorts of bumps, from slight expansion joints to sizable potholes. Our editors agreed it’s uncomfortable, and that’s a sacrifice you don’t necessarily have to make. The 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class ride decidedly better. Believe it or not, you could probably get the IS to ride even worse: Options include 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, as well as a performance-tuned F-Sport suspension.\n\nThanks to distinct suspension tuning, the convertible rides blessedly softer. Our IS 250C, which had the same 17-inch wheels, isolated road imperfections the sedan played up harshly. On the flip side, it didn’t have the most rigid structure. With the top down, the windshield frame shuddered a bit over broken pavement, but that’s a common characteristic in four-seat convertibles.\n\nSome may want more power steering assist at low speeds, in the vein of the A4 or C-Class, but the IS exhibits better feedback than either of those cars. The nose pushes a bit at first when barreling into sweeping curves, but the car settles on its rear nicely on the way out, proving nearly as drift-happy as a 3 Series or G37. My only gripe involves body roll, which was noticeable in both our cars.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin’s businesslike tones and low-gloss textures are typical Lexus traits, but our test cars’ faux metal trim and rubberized dash contours drew criticism. The door and center armrests felt short on padding. The A4 and G have better cabins, and just about every competitor is roomier. The IS’ cramped dimensions are apparent no matter where you’re sitting. Two editors bemoaned tight headroom in the sedan, and several noted the cabin’s narrowness, in part due to a wide center console that encroaches on hip and knee room.\n\nThe power-adjustable front seats are supportive and generally comfortable, and their long adjustment range should accommodate adults up to the low-6-foot range — backseat space be damned. And damned it is; legroom is as miserable there as in the 3 Series sedan, and headroom is tenable only because the seat sits low to the floor. Adults’ knees will either be raised in the air or digging into the front seatbacks, or both. Indeed, with 86 cubic feet of cabin volume, the IS sedan is among the smallest cars in its class. By the EPA’s standards, it’s a subcompact car. Similar money can get you a car one or two sizes larger, in the G37 or A4, and the Acura TL is even roomier. It’s 2011, and a sport sedan need not be this cramped.\n\nLexus offers the usual gamut of luxury options, from heated and ventilated front seats to a power rear sunshade. The optional Mark Levinson stereo, however, is worth skipping. We don’t often get deep into audiophile territory, but three editors remarked on their strong lack of love for the Levinson. No matter our adjustments, the treble was crashy and distorted, and the bass was a muddled mess. In a league with such aural standouts as the TL’s ELS stereo or the A4’s Bang & Olufsen system, Lexus disappoints.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the IS sedan earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side impacts. However, rear and roof-strength ratings were just Acceptable — one rung down from Good. It’s important to note these scores don’t translate to the IS convertible, which hasn’t been tested. Standard features include chest and knee airbags, plus seat-mounted side-impact airbags and two-row side curtain airbags in the sedan. The IS convertible has no curtain airbags, but its side-impact airbags include head extensions. Click here for a full list of features. On automatic convertibles, a collision warning system comes with the optional adaptive cruise control.\n\nReliability for the IS sedan has been good, but the convertible has performed below average. The stick-shift IS 250 starts at $33,295. That’s not bad given its generous list of standard features: an iPod/USB-compatible stereo, eight-way power front seats with power lumbar, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof and leather upholstery. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, a power rear sunshade, a navigation system, the Mark Levinson audio system and a backup camera. The IS 350 starts at $39,720 but comes standard with the automatic transmission. So do all-wheel-drive variants, which add $2,460 to $3,630 to the price tag, depending on the engine. Load up an all-wheel-drive IS 350, and the price nears $50,000. The IS convertible tops out near $57,000.\n\nIS in the Market\nThe IS has never put much of a dent in 3 Series sales. It’s been as popular as Audi’s A4 and S4, which are distant second-tier players in the heady entry-level luxury class. Lexus, however, looks to be on the verge of a product renaissance, in the vein of what happened to the brand mid-decade. Here’s hoping the IS’ coming makeover solves its practical issues — but doesn’t water down what’s good.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
