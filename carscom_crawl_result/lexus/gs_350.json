      "expert_review": "The 2013 Lexus GS 350 is race-inspired and feels sporty with its stiff suspension. With this redesigned midsize sedan, Lexus waves goodbye to the squishy and cushy and hopes to say hello to a new type of driver, the enthusiast.\n\nBut how does it work for the family driver? It works out well. My test car, a GS 350 F-Sport, came with the bells and whistles that make the average driver happy without sacrificing the performance that may interest enthusiast buyers. The five-seater is fun to drive with its 3.5-liter V-6 engine and nimble handling. The GS looks more modern with the updated spindle grille and squared-off taillights.\n\nThe GS F-Sport has the Lexus Drive Mode Selector that adapts drivetrain and in-car settings to Eco, Normal, Sport S and Sport S+ modes. I was impressed with how much power the V-6 had in Sport S+ mode. The suspension and steering were tighter, but the steering eased up at slower speeds. In Eco mode, the GS drove more conservatively for better fuel economy, and I was reminded it was in this mode with a blue-illuminated instrument cluster. When in Sport S and Sport S+ modes, the gauge cluster was lit red. In either mode, braking was responsive yet not too grabby.\n\nThe 2013 GS 350 has a starting price of $47,775, including an $875 destination charge. My test car, a GS 350 with all-wheel drive and the F Sport Package, cost $58,897.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe new GS looks more assertive and modern. It leans forward, looking ready to race at any stoplight or highway fast lane. This is a refreshing change; I like its powerful, sinewy aesthetic.\n\nThe sedan’s doors were easy to open for everyone in my family. Parents should note that the roofline at the rear doors slopes downward, making it difficult for parents to help little ones get in the car and buckled up. Head bonks and backaches will be the norm until your kids are able to get themselves buckled up.\n\nThe trunk is a good size, and parents should have few issues loading oddly shaped items like strollers and portable cribs into it. I liked the grocery hooks that folded down from the trunk and wished there was more than one set. Guess what doesn’t fold down? The rear seats. There’s a pass-through for longer items, but if you’re planning on extra trunk space — don’t.\n\nThe 2013 GS 350 has a 306-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 with direct injection, and it uses premium gas. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/28 mpg city/highway for the rear-wheel-drive GS 350. The all-wheel-drive version gets 19/26 mpg. These fuel-economy numbers don’t exactly scream eco, but maybe if you drive in Eco mode most of the time you can work out a better number.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe F-Sport Package adds amazing 16-way power-adjustable front seats to the GS 350. There was every adjustment available, including side bolsters and thigh adjustments. I could move the bottom seat cushion forward or back to provide support and prevent fatigue. Add to that the ventilated seat option and this mama rarely wanted to leave the GS’ cabin.\n\nLexus’ Enform multimedia system is simple to use. A mouse-like joystick works in conjunction with the display, and the cursor will “snap” into place when you get near your choice on the screen. This is cool, but it still required my eyes to be off the road more than I preferred.\n\nIn the backseat, my kids didn’t have all the seating options I did, but they loved the rear power sunshade that kept the sun off of them. The rear legroom was fine for them — they’re 10 and 8 years old — but it should be noted that a rear-facing infant-safety seat required the front passenger to sacrifice some legroom. At 5 feet 5 inches tall, I would have been OK sitting in front of the rear-facing safety seat, but my 6-foot-tall husband would have been cramped.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Lexus GS 350 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are two sets of Latch anchors in the GS 350’s outboard rear seats. The anchors are easy to use, so are the three tether anchors on the rear shelf. Rear seat belts are partially recessed into the bench, which may be tricky for kids in tall convertible seats to use. Find out how the 2013 GS 350 performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2013 GS 350 has standard rear-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera, active front head restraints and 10 airbags, including rear-seat side-impact airbags. Optional features are all-wheel drive, night vision, front and rear parking sensors, head-up display, adaptive headlights, and lane keep assist and departure warning systems.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Lexus GS 350 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2011 about the 2013 Lexus GS 350. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLexus isn’t known for exciting sports cars. It’s the leader in quiet, comfortable luxury sedans that deliver good value, but that’s not the reputation you want if you’re trying to sell a dynamic sport sedan like the GS 350 — even if it has made Lexus one of the best-selling luxury brands in recent history.\n\nThe 2013 Lexus GS sedan won’t just change the sport sedan’s place in the industry; it will change the entire brand when it goes on sale in February 2012.\n\nThe new GS’ impressive blend of nimble handling, quiet road manners, intriguing looks and high-level interior seem like the perfect blueprint for the brand’s future.\n\nPerformance\nThe old GS suffered from a split personality. It wasn’t sporty enough to win over BMW or Audi shoppers, nor was it comfortable enough to sway Mercedes-Benz shoppers. Somehow, the 2013 GS is both sportier and more comfortable, two characteristics that don’t typically go together.\n\nRear-wheel-drive GS sedans felt incredibly nimble through a closed road course set up by Lexus, with lots of grip and crisp, precise steering. Lexus supplied a new BMW 535i for comparison, and the BMW felt heavier and more bloated in the course’s tight, orange-cone-lined confines. In my opinion, the GS won, hands down.\n\nA few inches shorter than the 535i and nearly 200 pounds lighter, the GS felt like a different class of car in sharp turns. I had to adjust much more for the German sedan’s weight shift midway through maneuvers.\n\nThis is all well and good, but buyers will be commuting in the GS, not fighting for rally titles.\n\nLuckily, the GS shines there, too.\n\nOn expanses of desert roadways, the GS soared over the pavement with little noise intrusion, whether the surfaces were pristine or pockmarked. Lexus is already famed for its quiet driving experience, and the GS delivers that with a better feel for the road than the automaker’s ES and LS sedans. It’s just not as in-tune with the road as the 535, but that car is louder with a rougher ride.\n\nThe new GS carries over the same 3.5-liter V-6 engine as the 2011, with a six-speed automatic. It’s good for 306 horsepower, but it doesn’t come on as quickly as the twin-turbo inline-six in the BMW 535. Still, it will be enough for most buyers, and in terms of zero-to-60-mph speeds, the GS is in line with the 535. Both have manufacturer’s estimates of 5.7 seconds to 60 mph.\n\nThe base GS comes with Eco, Normal and Sport driving modes, while the F Sport Package adds a tighter suspension and available rear-wheel steering.\n\nI could feel the F Sport Package’s added undercarriage work on the road course, but it was much less apparent on those desert roads. I don’t see much need for the F Sport Package … unless you like the looks.\n\nBraking is responsive and might be the best of any Lexus on the market, although that’s not a ringing endorsement in itself. It falls between the aggressive braking of the 5 Series and the more lethargic Infiniti M sedan.\n\nAll-wheel drive is also available on the GS 350, but not on the hybrid.\n\nThe GS 350 is estimated to return mileage of 19/28 mpg city/highway. The city figure is unchanged from the outgoing model, but highway ratings are up 2 mpg. They’re now identical to the BMW 535’s figures and slightly ahead of the Infiniti M37’s 18/26 mpg city/highway.\n\nExterior\nEven though the new GS doesn’t offer ultimate performance, Lexus may have found a way to sway shoppers who think they want sporty driving, but in fact just want to feel like they’re in a sports car. It looks really cool.\n\nDesigned around the LF-Gh Concept, the real thing features an oddly shaped grille that Lexus calls a “spindle.” It may look too aggressive in some pictures, but in person there’s more elegance to it, especially when you’re not looking at it head-on. The grille will be featured on all future models, according to Lexus.\n\nA variety of colors look good, from the menacing black to a more sophisticated dark red. There are also unique dark aquamarine and brown shades that I found attractive.\n\nLED running lights come standard, as do bi-xenon headlights. LED headlights are optional. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, and 18s come on the Luxury Package or hybrid. The F Sport has 19-inch wheels with wider rear rims that Lexus says are the widest it’s ever put on a sedan. It also has unique grille mesh.\n\nInterior\nIf the outside draws shoppers in, the interior will wow them. I don’t normally go gaga over interior design, especially in a Lexus, but the thin silver strip in the center of the dash where a CD is inserted — does anyone still bring CDs into cars? — sets the table.\n\nThe minimalist look doesn’t continue to the doors and seats, where expensive-looking wood grains and stitched leather cover nearly every surface. The F Sport comes with a silver-colored grain that doesn’t look like it could exist in nature, along with glossy piano-black finishes. Another option is a Bamboo trim package with a thick steering wheel with solid bamboo that replaces the standard leather-wrapped one. I didn’t love the bamboo inserts on the dash, neither their vibrant yellow hue nor the feel of the wood.\n\nInterior materials are on par with the Infiniti M, which I find quite luxurious for the price, and I didn’t feel the Lexus was significantly behind the 5 Series or Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nThe standard front seats have 10-way adjustments, and options add up to 18 adjustments, including side bolsters and lower and upper lumbar supports. All the seats I tried out were extremely comfortable. These seats aren’t just for skinny drivers, either, with plenty of thigh support and nice wide seat bottoms and backs.\n\nOverall, the sense of space in the GS is much greater than the previous model’s despite the fact that most dimensions didn’t change much. There’s plenty of glass, visibility is good and the center console doesn’t rise too high. My left knee did seem a little close to the door, but the dead pedal was well-placed, so I would probably keep my foot there instead of flat on the floor.\n\nAt 5-foot-10, I had plenty of backseat headroom and legroom with the driver’s seat in my driving position, but, as in front, the door seemed pretty close, which can lead to a claustrophobic feeling. There’s an oversized center armrest that, in the Luxury trim level, features rear climate control.\n\nAt 14.3 cubic feet, the trunk is much larger than the previous generation’s 12.0 cubic feet. It’s right in line with the 5 Series and Infiniti M, at 14 and 14.9 cubic feet, respectively. Lexus also repackaged the hybrid battery so it doesn’t take up as much trunk space as the previous generation’s; the hybrid now has a respectable 13.2 cubic feet.\n\nNone of the GS models has folding rear seats, though there is a pass-through behind the armrest for skis and other lengthy objects.\n\nGS 450h Hybrid\nI still don’t believe hybrids are a good fit for a luxury model like this. While the Lexus CT 200h compact hatchback is a neat package, dropping a hybrid powertrain into a larger car like the GS yields mileage gains in a segment where shoppers don’t worry as much about pain at the pump. Mileage is rated 39/34 mpg.\n\nLuckily, the GS 450h feels fast. The hybrid system puts out more total power than the gas version, 338 total hp, and even with less torque (254 pounds feet) power comes on quickly. At high speeds, it aids in passing power and pushes you back in your seat harder than the standard drivetrain.\n\nHowever, the continuously variable automatic transmission isn’t as smooth as the six-speed automatic. It allows for quicker acceleration but doesn’t feel as natural when driving aggressively.\n\nBraking is incredibly good, however, a complaint I often have in hybrid models. Most owners won’t even notice the regenerative brakes.\n\nThe only exterior alterations to the hybrid are unique 18-inch wheels running on the same all-season tires as other GS models — no low-rolling-resistance tires here. The tailpipes are hidden and point downward. There are small hybrid badges on the rear doors, and the L emblems on the grille and trunk are outlined in blue.\n\nI don’t know why anyone would opt for a hybrid GS with its higher sticker price, even with the mileage gains.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nPricing hasn’t been announced, but we expect the 2013 GS to be priced similarly to the outgoing model’s starting price of $46,900. The Infiniti M37 starts at $47,700 and the BMW 535 starts at $52,250. Both those lines, however, feature other engine options that offer more choice for consumers, while the Lexus comes with just the V-6 and hybrid drivetrains.\n\nThe base GS with standard 17-inch wheels, dual climate control and an 8-inch navigation system might not be easy to find unless you order your car to suit; Lexus expects nearly all models to be sold with the optional 12.3-inch center LCD screen.\n\nIt’s a stunning system that switches between the full-screen menu and a split-screen with 8 inches of navigation and 4.3 inches of system information. The left, 8-inch portion can also display music and apps, including Pandora internet radio and a Bing search feature.\n\nThe Bing search uses the internet and voice inputs to find destinations only, meaning you can say “Apple Store” and it will find the nearest Apple Store location, but it won’t take you to apple.com via a web browser. Once you confirm the found destination is where you want to go, the Bing app seamlessly and quickly switches to the Lexus navigation screen. I’ve reviewed a lot of cars with navigation, and this is the most natural integration of voice-to-destination and routing I’ve seen.\n\nUnfortunately, another stand-alone option, the 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system, is less stellar. I’ve found only one application of the system — in the RX SUV — to be on par with other premium stereos on the market. My main beef is that it’s designed to get the most out of high-end, 5.1 surround-sound music sources. To date, only DVD-audio discs can match this perfectly. My iPod — the same one I test in every car — sounded hollow, with only high-end, acoustic instruments resounding with clarity.\n\nTraditional option packages start with the Premium Package, which adds rain-sensing wipers, heated and ventilated front seats, and a rear power sunshade.\n\nThe Luxury Package adds an adaptive variable suspension, higher-grade leather seating, adaptive headlights, 18-way front seats, rear climate control, 18-inch wheels and manual rear sunshades.\n\nNone of the option packages have been priced.\n\nSafety\nThe GS comes with a healthy array of airbags, including driver and front passenger knee airbags. Rear passengers also get seat-mounted side airbags standard.\n\nSafety features like pre-collision warning, a blind spot monitor and lane departure warning are optional, as is a new eye-scanning monitor that tracks when a driver’s eyes are closing. Unfortunately, I couldn’t test this feature because it works only at night and only activates if a collision is imminent. It turns the pre-collision warning system on 1.2 seconds earlier than it would for an alert driver. The device sits atop the steering column, where it blocked the odometer from my line of sight.\n\nLexus GS in the Market\nLexus needs a hit, another model that leads its class — like the RX SUV. They need to recover from a year of cataclysmic events they couldn’t prevent and an aging lineup they should have turned over before now.\n\nThe GS is the tip of the brand’s spear as it heads for a turnaround. As a stand-alone product, it’s a winner. If it’s truly a sign of things to come, it’s even more significant.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Lexus GS 350 is a rear-wheel-drive sports sedan with a powerful V-6 engine and available all-wheel drive. To get a V-8 with the GS, look at the more expensive GS 460. The GS 350 competes with midsize sport sedans like the BMW 535i, Mercedes-Benz E350, Cadillac STS V-6 and Acura RL. A hybrid GS 450h uses a gas-electric V-6 powertrain, and along with the GS 460, only comes with rear-wheel drive; they’re covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2011\nA brake override system is now standard. This system automatically reduces engine power when the brake and accelerator pedals are pressed at the same time to prevent unintended acceleration. The only other change of note is that models with the optional navigation system no longer have a compass in the inside mirror because the nav system has a compass.\n\nExterior\nLexus says the sedan has a futuristic look. The GS 350 has a long hood, a short rear deck and wide, tapered rear pillars that flow back to the car’s rear. Long side glass and a steep back window enhance the car’s performance image. Exterior features include:\n\n17-inch wheels\nOptional 18-inch wheels\nAvailable moonroof and power rear sunshade\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the GS 350, though the backseat is snug. The optional navigation system comes with Bluetooth, voice activation and a backup camera. A 7-inch dashboard screen works with the navigation system and also serves as a monitor for the Intuitive Park Assist system. Interior features include:\n\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nAluminum-face gauge cluster\n10-way power front seats with heated leather upholstery; available fan ventilation\nPush-button start\nDual-zone climate control\n10-speaker, six-CD stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll-wheel drive is available for the GS 350. Hydraulic controls in the system vary the front/rear torque split from 30/70 to 50/50 and provide what Lexus calls the performance advantages of rear-wheel drive with the traction of all-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n3.5-liter V-6 engine makes 303 horsepower and 274 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nAn option group includes adaptive cruise control and the Pre-Collision System that helps determine if a crash is imminent and takes appropriate steps if it is. Other options include park assist and adaptive headlights that swivel with the front wheels.\n\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard front seat-mounted side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags for both rows\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system\nStandard active front head restraints\nOptional Pre-Collision System incorporates active braking",

      "expert_review": "From a distance, the 2009 Lexus GS 350 looks similar to my car, and I mistakenly thought it’d drive just like my car. I quickly realized the error of my thinking as I neared the GS 350. My black Volkswagen Jetta is like a prepubescent Dakota Fanning compared to the GS 350’s Charlize Theron. Where my Jetta is cute with a charmingly ungraceful pep, the Lexus is beautiful, mature and capable of a powerful, award-winning performance.\n\nWhen I got inside the GS 350, the contrast between it and my car became even more glaring. The GS 350’s supple leather seats cradled my tired thighs and adjusted to the perfect angle for my body. The car felt sturdy but accelerated so easily and lightly that it seemed like I was simply gliding over the streets. Maybe I’d had a few rough days and needed some pampering, but boy, oh boy, did this car feel good to me.\n\nEven the GS’ gas mileage was better than expected. It gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway, but I averaged about 23 mpg.\n\nIt has a V-6 engine that makes 303 horsepower and goes from zero to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. That will get you through your errands quickly, trust me! In fact, this car was fast enough that my son instructed me to “dust” people – effortlessly fly past them and leave them in our dust – while we were driving.\n\nThe GS 350 is offered in both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive. My test vehicle had all-wheel drive, and I’d take it no other way with Colorado as my home. While it didn’t snow during my test drive, it did rain quite a bit. I barely noticed the rain because of this car’s sturdy handling, smooth ride and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n\nExterior\n\nLexus says the GS 350 is “boldly and elegantly styled in such a way to enhance its aerodynamics.” That’s no gimmick. This is a pretty, sinewy car that flies over the streets with languid ease. The body is a bit wider than I expected, but it’s not cumbersome. The polished dual exhaust pipes give it a sporty edge that winks at other driver left in your dust.\n\nYou also get 17-inch alloy wheels, power heated side mirrors, a power moonroof and auto-leveling high-intensity-discharge headlights. Adaptive headlights that swivel with the front wheels are available. The doors are heavy, but not heavy enough that my newly minted 3-year-old son couldn’t push them shut.\n\nThe GS 350’s brakes are dreamy. I don’t usually give a lot of thought to brakes, but they were one of the first things I noticed in this car. They’re responsive and smooth. I even had a few girlfriends in the car at one point, all of whom commented on the brakes. Who knew?\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe GS 350’s interior is just as delightful as its exterior. Since this is a luxury vehicle, some of the standard features are pretty posh; the leather seats I swooned over come standard, and I assure you, they’re of the very highest standard.\n\nThe GS 350 has plenty of other upscale standard features, including automatic dual-zone climate control, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and an MP3 jack. The only standard feature that I giggled about was the cassette player. A cassette player, really? I grew up with cassettes but thought all new cars had dropped the long-past music player.\n\nA 10-speaker premium audio system is standard, but my test car had the optional 14-speaker Mark Levinson DVD surround-sound system that’s paired with a voice-activated navigation system and backup camera. My music sounded awesome in this car. Not to sound greedy, but I would have loved to try the GS 350 with a few of its other available options like ventilated front seats and an automatic rear sunshade. However, I realize beggars cannot be choosers.\n\nYou can seat five in the GS 350. It’s so roomy in the backseat that I was able to easily sit between my little ones’ child-safety seats, which is a rarity in a sedan. There’s plenty of legroom in the second row for adults or rear-facing car seats. If you don’t have someone sitting in the back row’s middle seat, two cupholders pop out of the fold-down armrest.\n\nThe trunk was plenty spacious for my geared-up family of four. There is a pass-through from the trunk for your skis (or whatever ski-shaped things you tote around), too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2009 Lexus GS 350 includes all of the safety accoutrements you’d expect from a luxury mobile. There are airbags galore, including driver and front passenger knee airbags, side-impact airbags for both rows and side curtain airbags for both rows. The GS also comes with stability control, antilock brakes with brake assist and traction control. It also has a standard first-aid kit and a tool kit. I’m all about the little things in life, and when I saw these kits I went weak in the knees.\n\nMy test car had the optional backup camera, a feature I always appreciate. You can also opt for the Pre-Collision System that uses radar to determine if a collision is imminent. It tightens your seat belts and activates brake-assist to help mitigate impact. Park assist is also available.\n\nOne thing that didn’t impress me in the GS 350 was the tough-to-access Latch connectors. Mamas want and deserve to drive luxury cars, but automakers must make those Latch connectors accessible without us breaking our nails, scratching up our hands or chipping our bling just to connect a car seat.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s tons of space in the backseat for rear-facing child-safety seats as well as in the trunk for strollers and more.\n\nIn School: Kids will love the roomy second row that’ll keep their sibling from touching them.\n\nTeens: Teen drivers will be spoiled by all of the incredible features in this sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Some people just want a nice, upscale sedan to get around in, and the 2015 Lexus GS 350 fits those consumers like a glove.\n\nThe most memorable thing about my time with the 2015 Lexus GS 350 was my husband’s nickname for it: “The AARP Sports Car,” generally accompanied by a dramatic yawn. Well, I’ve got news for you, Husband. Not everyone wants or needs to drive around in something super flashy.\n\nThe Lexus GS 350 is one of those cars that’s totally pleasant to drive and has plenty of power and a smooth, quiet ride — but by next week might fade into the oblivion of other perfectly pleasant sedans I’ve driven over the past decade.\n\nIt comes with either AWD or RWD in base and the new Crafted Line trim level for 2015 — though the F Sport and Luxury option packages available on the base trim are extensive enough to be trim levels of their own. I drove a RWD base model equipped with the $4,640 F Sport Package. Compare them side-by-side here. (Note that the F Sport Package isn’t the same as the Lexus GS F, a V-8-powered performance car coming as a 2016 model.)\n\nIn addition to the new Crafted Line, Lexus has changed the GS 350’s multimedia display for 2015, updated its Enform App Suite and upgraded the standard 18-inch wheel and tires. My test car had 19-inch wheel and tires as part of the F Sport Package. You’ll pay a slightly higher base price for the updates this year. Check out this year’s GS 350 alongside last year’s here.\n\nIf the GS isn’t quite your thing, you may also want to research the Infiniti Q70 and the Audi A6. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Lexus GS 350 in Atomic Silver that I drove blended in with the masses; it was quite hard to find in a parking lot. Despite what Lexus calls the looks of a “road-hungry machine” when decked out with the sporty-ish F Sport Package, the car I drove looked like a regular sedan from the back. The front grille has some funky angles framed by Lexus’ L-shaped LED daytime running lights. I suppose they could be described as hungry-looking if you saw them in your rearview mirror, riding up on your tail on the highway. Maybe.\n\nTo hunt the car down to quickly get my own “food-hungry machines” (ages 10, 12 and 14) to lunch, I used the remote alarm to find it before anyone turned hangry. Crisis averted.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe GS 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 was sufficiently peppy given its retirement sports-car status (maybe it popped a little blue pill or two before our week together?).\n\nThe GS 350’s ability to switch between Eco, Normal and Sport S modes lets the driver select the drive experience, varying accelerator response, shift sensitivity, power-steering assist and, in models with the optional adaptive suspension, ride firmness. Eco mode leads to a slightly mellower experience on the road, without any of that sluggish feeling many cars exhibit in similar modes. I primarily drove in Eco. The Sport S mode is what you’d expect, with a more honed feeling as the GS runs through the gears. When equipped with the F Sport Package, the GS 350 features a fourth mode, Sport S+, which provides even more aggressive settings.\n\nThe GS 350 gets an EPA-estimated 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. With rear-wheel drive, mileage is rated 19/29/23 mpg. This is an advantage over the six-cylinder Infiniti Q70’s 18/24/20 with all-wheel drive and 18/26/21 with rear-wheel drive. The newly released 2016 A6, though, has even more of an advantage in the fuel economy arena, given its fuel-efficient turbocharged four-cylinder engine: its EPA estimates mileage at 24/35/28 mpg with front-wheel drive and 22/32/26 with all-wheel drive. The A6’s advantage extends to the 3.0T trim level’s supercharged V-6, too, which gets an estimated 20/30/24 mpg with all-wheel drive. Obviously, your actual mileage may vary.\n\nLexus also makes a hybrid GS called the GS 450h that delivers an EPA mileage estimate of 29/34/31 mpg despite providing 32 horsepower more than the GS 350’s 306 hp. It also costs almost $13,000 more.\n\nInterior\nThe Lexus GS 350’s interior is appropriately upscale in its fit and finish, yet relatively basic in its general configuration. There are two cupholders up front, as well as narrow in-door pockets. The pockets, however, are missing molded bottleholders, which became a frustration after a few mornings on the go with my husband and our two coffee cups and water bottles. My husband ended up stashing the water bottles on the floor, pinching them between his feet to keep them from rolling around.\n\nExtra bottleholders, please, Lexus.\n\nThe center console is a relatively standard size, with a top tray that can be removed for additional space to fit a small purse. The armrest, which is also the lid to the console, slides back and forth to fit drivers of short or tall statures.\n\nThe small moonroof over the front seats alone dates the car and had me wishing for a panoramic moonroof a la the Hyundai Azera. The ventilated front seats in my test car (part of the F Sport Package; they’re also heated) were a bonus in the searing summer heat.\n\nMuch to the dismay of my three daughters, the backseat was very standard. The 36.3 inches of rear legroom is about even with the Infiniti Q70’s 36.2 inches but small compared with the Audi A6’s 37.4 inches. There are pockets on the back of both front seats, as well as a fold-down armrest with a storage bin in the center position. Each of the rear doors has a small in-door pocket with a slight bump-out that might fit a skinny water bottle. Rear air vents — with the ability to modify both flow and air direction — are stashed at the rear of the center console.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Lexus GS 350 features a new multimedia system this year. While I love the massive 12.3-inch screen that can be configured in several ways, I’m not a fan of the mouse-like controller that operates it. I found it very touchy. You have to have a delicate touch to move the cursor exactly onto the climate icon, for example; the cursor kept skipping over it to either the media or phone icons on either side. Why not bypass all that nonsense and just let me use my finger to press the climate icon?\n\nLexus was early to the table with its Enform system, which allows access to apps including but not limited to internet radio services like iHeartRadio and Pandora. It also has Bing, OpenTable, MovieTickets.com, Yelp, etc. I’m just kind of baffled by this. Why not simply access these via a smartphone while safely parked? I personally use them all the time that way, so it would take me a fraction of the time to access the same information on my phone.\n\nPairing a phone via Bluetooth for both hands-free communication and streaming audio in the Lexus GS 350, however, took literally 30 seconds. It was both simple and intuitive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Lexus GS 350 has 14.1 cubic feet of trunk space (the same as the Audi A6), which Lexus says is enough to fit four golf bags. I was flat out of tee times during my time with the GS, so I didn’t test it for golf bag capacity, but a week’s worth of groceries for a family of five was an easy fit. The Infiniti Q70 has a slightly larger 14.9 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nThe GS lacks a folding backseat but has a pass-through behind the backseat’s center armrest. That’s common in this class, though the A6 is a notable exception.\n\nMy test car came equipped with an optional $500 one-touch power trunk. There’s a button to open it near the driver’s left knee, and it can also be opened remotely via the key fob. Closing it is as simple as pressing a button on the trunk lid.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Lexus GS received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good (on a scale of poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in the moderate-overlap front, side, roof-strength and head-restraint/seat tests. As of publication, it hadn’t yet undergone the small-overlap front crash test in which the A6 and Q70 earned scores of good. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t tested the GS.\n\nWhile my test car didn’t have this feature, a pre-collision system is available on the Lexus GS 350. It features a forward-collision warning system along with adaptive cruise control. After the warning, it prepares the brakes for increased stopping power by making the brake pedal more sensitive, but the system doesn’t apply the brakes automatically. This system also has a driver’s eye monitor to “watch” you, the driver, and make sure you’re paying attention to the road.\n\nMy favorite feature in the Lexus GS 350 is the extra-large backup camera display with rear cross-traffic alert. This system alerted me audibly to both pedestrians and cars behind and to the sides of the car that I definitely would not have seen myself when backing out of parking spaces. There are some instances — and this is one of them — when our human limitations can absolutely be moderated with the help of computerized systems.\n\nThe two sets of Latch anchors in the GS 350’s outboard rear seats are buried deeply within the seat bight, so installing child-safety seats using Latch may be a little on the tricky side. Once your kids get to booster seat age/size, things probably won’t get much easier for you. In addition to the terrible tantrums at this age, the seat belt buckles in the rear seating positions are flush with the seat bottom cushion, so booster seats can slip over the top of them, requiring regular readjustment for access to the buckles. You can check out our full Car Seat Check of last year’s 2014 GS 350, which also applies to the 2015, here.\n\nSee all the Lexus’ standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Lexus GS 350 is a solid, slightly upmarket choice for sedan buyers. It offers some uniqueness in features like its massive multimedia display screen and customizable drive modes, but you might be able to find something more dynamic and interesting elsewhere at this price.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Available as both a turbo four-cylinder GS 300 and a hybrid GS 450h in addition to the V-6-powered GS 350 I tested, this is the last of the old-style Lexus sedans — competent, well-engineered and certainly quiet inside. But exciting it is not, and nor is it state of the art. It is part of a shrinking class, as Lexus buyers opt for RX SUVs over GS or ES sedans by a significant margin. Anyone seeking an entertaining, stylish, up-to-date luxury sports sedan will need to look elsewhere.\n\nThe Least Offensive-Looking Lexus?\n\nWhen it first appeared in its latest iteration several years ago, the Lexus GS was considered to be wildly styled. Not anymore. Nowadays, it’s pretty much the least offensive model in the lineup style-wise, appearing as a more traditional, upright sedan next to the more expensive LS’ wild, swoopy, polarizing styling. It’s got LED headlamps and LED daytime running lights done up in the now-familiar Nike swoosh style that’s become a Lexus signature. The spindle grille that has found its way across the entire Lexus lineup looks only mildly outrageous here, where it was first seen, instead of full-on silly, as it does on some other Lexus models.\n\nThe Sedate Sedan\n\nIts formal look may be a bit of a throwback, but the theme continues in how the GS 350 drives. This is pure old-school Lexus sedan here: quiet, sedate, serene and comfortable. If you’re looking for a pulse-pounding sports sedan, you’re in the wrong place. Either you’ll want to splurge for the slightly nutty V-8-powered GS-F or you’ll want to mosey down to your local Alfa Romeo dealership, as the mission of this Lexus seems to be providing relaxed, isolated travel more than backroad thrills.\n\nThe GS 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 making a decent, if not stellar, 311 horsepower but just 280 pounds-feet of torque. This is a little down from competitors like the Cadillac CTS and its 3.6-liter V-6’s 335 hp, as well as the Infiniti Q70 and its 3.7-liter V-6’s 330 hp, but they all match up pretty evenly on torque. Opt for a BMW in the same price class and you’ll get a 530i with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out just 248 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a better match for the Lexus GS 300, which also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine making 241 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque, but that car isn’t available with all-wheel drive — and it starts at roughly $6,000 less.\n\nThe Lexus V-6 is stout and powerful, and it thankfully doesn’t have much weight to lug around. The GS 350 is reasonably light, at just under 3,900 pounds — less than the Cadillac or Infiniti. This powertrain shows its age, however, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission when most competitors have seven- or eight-speed automatics. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but my car had the optional all-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk but uneventful; the engine provides little aural stimulation as it goes about its work, moving the GS through traffic with no drama. The car’s handling is neutral, not as numb as the front-wheel-drive ES 350 or as isolated as the flagship LS, but also not possessed of much steering feel or any eagerness to be driven quickly. You do get a nicely damped, smooth and quiet ride, thanks in part to 18-inch wheels on all-season tires and copious amounts of sound deadening. The overall experience is a premium one, though not necessarily a luxurious one, as it’s wrapped in a package that feels more traditional than modern.\n\nPremium Accommodations\n\nPart of the reason the GS 350 lacks a true luxury feel is its outdated interior. While Lexus has bestowed some wild style on the rest of its lineup (the LC 500 coupe is show-car-level crazy, and the LS flagship is just “out-there” different), the GS line maintains a fairly ordinary, unremarkable layout. It’s comfortable, with big seats up front and plenty of width in both the front and rear seats. There’s copious headroom in front and back thanks to an upright cabin with big windows all around — especially the back window, which looks just massive when gazing out the rearview mirror. Legroom in back is a bit tight, however, with taller passengers’ knees easily contacting the front seatbacks. While some modern vehicles are going for a bunker-style look with tall body sides and a low roofline, as with the Cadillac or Infiniti, the Lexus GS retains a user-friendliness that eschews modern style for traditional values.\n\nWhile it’s comfortable in the GS, it’s also boring. Materials quality is acceptable if not class-leading, but there’s precious little style. The dashboard shape is formal and devoid of visual interest. Buttons and switches are no better than one might find in a past-generation high-end Toyota Camry or Avalon. And don’t get me started on the multimedia system.\n\nOK, do get me started: The Lexus trackpad-style multimedia system is garbage. This has to be the worst interface on the market today, and Lexus continues to proliferate it across its lineup, with each new vehicle failing to improve upon it in any measurable way despite variations such as a touchpad in other models. It operates by moving a cursor around the screen using a joystick-style “Remote Touch Interface Controller” on the console between the seats — akin to using a point-and-click laptop computer system while driving down the highway. To say it’s distracting is an understatement; Lexus needs to bin the whole system and start from scratch. The system is bad enough to prevent me from recommending any Lexus-brand vehicle that features it … which is every single one of them except the GX SUV, and that features a 10-year-old interior that predates Remote Touch Interface.\n\nAt least the interior is well-equipped for the price. There’s a standard moonroof, navigation, satellite radio, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone climate control and 10-way power-adjustable front seats. The seats are real leather, as is the steering wheel and shift knob. The Premium Package adds rain-sensing wipers and heated and ventilated seats. For the price of a well-equipped Lexus GS, you can get only a basic BMW 530i, so Lexus is bringing some value to the interior, at least.\n\nSafety\n\nThe GS also has a decent level of safety equipment, with the Lexus Safety System Plus standard. This includes a precollision system with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, all-speed dynamic cruise control, lane departure alert with lane keep assist, a blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, automatic high-beams and LED headlamps. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has rated the Lexus GS a top score of good in many areas, but its testing is incomplete (see the results here). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not tested the Lexus GS.\n\nPriced to Sell\n\nSo the Lexus GS may not be the most advanced, the sportiest, the most stylish or the most technology-packed mid-size luxury sedan on the market. But it is reasonably priced — much more so than many of its German competitors. Starting price for a turbocharged four-cylinder 2018 GS 300 is $47,505 including destination, and the six-cylinder GS 350 AWD I drove begins at $51,560. A RWD GS 350 costs $51,890, mysteriously more expensive than the AWD model, presumably due to different standard equipment, such as different sport-tuned brakes. My test car included a few options, like the Premium Package, gray sapele trim for the leather-wrapped steering wheel, some exterior body cladding and illuminated door sills, all of which bumped the price up to a still-reasonable $54,394. If you’re looking for more grunt, you can upgrade to a GS-F and its massively powerful V-8, but be prepared to spend some coin: it starts at $85,345 — over 30 grand more than a GS 350. Compare the various GS models here.\n\nCompared with competitors like the Cadillac CTS, Infiniti Q70 and BMW 530i, the Lexus starts thousands of dollars lower and features more standard safety equipment. It doesn’t deliver the same entertaining driving experience as the Cadillac or BMW, but it does have a more comfortable cabin, especially for backseat passengers, than either of those models. The Infiniti is pretty sizable on its own, however, and represents an interesting foil to the Lexus’ traditional luxury. It feels arguably just as premium inside, has a less frustrating (but by no means perfect) multimedia system, and it’s styling is no more or less controversial than the Lexus. Compare them all here. Given shoppers’ increasing penchant for SUVs over sedans, if you’re still in the market for something traditional and conservative with four doors and a trunk, you may want to check out the Lexus before it gets trended out of existence.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Available as both a turbo four-cylinder GS 300 and a hybrid GS 450h in addition to the V-6-powered GS 350 I tested, this is the last of the old-style Lexus sedans — competent, well-engineered and certainly quiet inside. But exciting it is not, and nor is it state of the art. It is part of a shrinking class, as Lexus buyers opt for RX SUVs over GS or ES sedans by a significant margin. Anyone seeking an entertaining, stylish, up-to-date luxury sports sedan will need to look elsewhere.\n\nThe Least Offensive-Looking Lexus?\n\nWhen it first appeared in its latest iteration several years ago, the Lexus GS was considered to be wildly styled. Not anymore. Nowadays, it’s pretty much the least offensive model in the lineup style-wise, appearing as a more traditional, upright sedan next to the more expensive LS’ wild, swoopy, polarizing styling. It’s got LED headlamps and LED daytime running lights done up in the now-familiar Nike swoosh style that’s become a Lexus signature. The spindle grille that has found its way across the entire Lexus lineup looks only mildly outrageous here, where it was first seen, instead of full-on silly, as it does on some other Lexus models.\n\nThe Sedate Sedan\n\nIts formal look may be a bit of a throwback, but the theme continues in how the GS 350 drives. This is pure old-school Lexus sedan here: quiet, sedate, serene and comfortable. If you’re looking for a pulse-pounding sports sedan, you’re in the wrong place. Either you’ll want to splurge for the slightly nutty V-8-powered GS-F or you’ll want to mosey down to your local Alfa Romeo dealership, as the mission of this Lexus seems to be providing relaxed, isolated travel more than backroad thrills.\n\nThe GS 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 making a decent, if not stellar, 311 horsepower but just 280 pounds-feet of torque. This is a little down from competitors like the Cadillac CTS and its 3.6-liter V-6’s 335 hp, as well as the Infiniti Q70 and its 3.7-liter V-6’s 330 hp, but they all match up pretty evenly on torque. Opt for a BMW in the same price class and you’ll get a 530i with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out just 248 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a better match for the Lexus GS 300, which also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine making 241 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque, but that car isn’t available with all-wheel drive — and it starts at roughly $6,000 less.\n\nThe Lexus V-6 is stout and powerful, and it thankfully doesn’t have much weight to lug around. The GS 350 is reasonably light, at just under 3,900 pounds — less than the Cadillac or Infiniti. This powertrain shows its age, however, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission when most competitors have seven- or eight-speed automatics. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but my car had the optional all-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk but uneventful; the engine provides little aural stimulation as it goes about its work, moving the GS through traffic with no drama. The car’s handling is neutral, not as numb as the front-wheel-drive ES 350 or as isolated as the flagship LS, but also not possessed of much steering feel or any eagerness to be driven quickly. You do get a nicely damped, smooth and quiet ride, thanks in part to 18-inch wheels on all-season tires and copious amounts of sound deadening. The overall experience is a premium one, though not necessarily a luxurious one, as it’s wrapped in a package that feels more traditional than modern.\n\nPremium Accommodations\n\nPart of the reason the GS 350 lacks a true luxury feel is its outdated interior. While Lexus has bestowed some wild style on the rest of its lineup (the LC 500 coupe is show-car-level crazy, and the LS flagship is just “out-there” different), the GS line maintains a fairly ordinary, unremarkable layout. It’s comfortable, with big seats up front and plenty of width in both the front and rear seats. There’s copious headroom in front and back thanks to an upright cabin with big windows all around — especially the back window, which looks just massive when gazing out the rearview mirror. Legroom in back is a bit tight, however, with taller passengers’ knees easily contacting the front seatbacks. While some modern vehicles are going for a bunker-style look with tall body sides and a low roofline, as with the Cadillac or Infiniti, the Lexus GS retains a user-friendliness that eschews modern style for traditional values.\n\nWhile it’s comfortable in the GS, it’s also boring. Materials quality is acceptable if not class-leading, but there’s precious little style. The dashboard shape is formal and devoid of visual interest. Buttons and switches are no better than one might find in a past-generation high-end Toyota Camry or Avalon. And don’t get me started on the multimedia system.\n\nOK, do get me started: The Lexus trackpad-style multimedia system is garbage. This has to be the worst interface on the market today, and Lexus continues to proliferate it across its lineup, with each new vehicle failing to improve upon it in any measurable way despite variations such as a touchpad in other models. It operates by moving a cursor around the screen using a joystick-style “Remote Touch Interface Controller” on the console between the seats — akin to using a point-and-click laptop computer system while driving down the highway. To say it’s distracting is an understatement; Lexus needs to bin the whole system and start from scratch. The system is bad enough to prevent me from recommending any Lexus-brand vehicle that features it … which is every single one of them except the GX SUV, and that features a 10-year-old interior that predates Remote Touch Interface.\n\nAt least the interior is well-equipped for the price. There’s a standard moonroof, navigation, satellite radio, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone climate control and 10-way power-adjustable front seats. The seats are real leather, as is the steering wheel and shift knob. The Premium Package adds rain-sensing wipers and heated and ventilated seats. For the price of a well-equipped Lexus GS, you can get only a basic BMW 530i, so Lexus is bringing some value to the interior, at least.\n\nSafety\n\nThe GS also has a decent level of safety equipment, with the Lexus Safety System Plus standard. This includes a precollision system with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, all-speed dynamic cruise control, lane departure alert with lane keep assist, a blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, automatic high-beams and LED headlamps. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has rated the Lexus GS a top score of good in many areas, but its testing is incomplete (see the results here). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not tested the Lexus GS.\n\nPriced to Sell\n\nSo the Lexus GS may not be the most advanced, the sportiest, the most stylish or the most technology-packed mid-size luxury sedan on the market. But it is reasonably priced — much more so than many of its German competitors. Starting price for a turbocharged four-cylinder 2018 GS 300 is $47,505 including destination, and the six-cylinder GS 350 AWD I drove begins at $51,560. A RWD GS 350 costs $51,890, mysteriously more expensive than the AWD model, presumably due to different standard equipment, such as different sport-tuned brakes. My test car included a few options, like the Premium Package, gray sapele trim for the leather-wrapped steering wheel, some exterior body cladding and illuminated door sills, all of which bumped the price up to a still-reasonable $54,394. If you’re looking for more grunt, you can upgrade to a GS-F and its massively powerful V-8, but be prepared to spend some coin: it starts at $85,345 — over 30 grand more than a GS 350. Compare the various GS models here.\n\nCompared with competitors like the Cadillac CTS, Infiniti Q70 and BMW 530i, the Lexus starts thousands of dollars lower and features more standard safety equipment. It doesn’t deliver the same entertaining driving experience as the Cadillac or BMW, but it does have a more comfortable cabin, especially for backseat passengers, than either of those models. The Infiniti is pretty sizable on its own, however, and represents an interesting foil to the Lexus’ traditional luxury. It feels arguably just as premium inside, has a less frustrating (but by no means perfect) multimedia system, and it’s styling is no more or less controversial than the Lexus. Compare them all here. Given shoppers’ increasing penchant for SUVs over sedans, if you’re still in the market for something traditional and conservative with four doors and a trunk, you may want to check out the Lexus before it gets trended out of existence.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nThe 2020 Lexus GS is a mid-size luxury sedan that seats five people. The GS 350 is powered by a 311-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission goes in rear-wheel-drive models while all-wheel-drive versions get a six-speed automatic. The sporty rear-wheel-drive GS F features a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Volvo S90 and Audi A6. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nA new Black Line Special Edition for F Sport versions of the GS 350 is available. Limited to 200 units, the cosmetic package includes gloss-black wheels, gloss-black grille inserts, black mirror caps and a black rear spoiler. Inside, the black leather interior is accented by red trim and carbon fiber. Meanwhile, the GS F adds standard matte-black 19-inch wheels and optional blue brake calipers.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus GS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include a 12.3-inch dashboard screen, navigation, a power-adjustable steering column and a moonroof. Standard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, automatic high-beam headlights, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist.\n\nOptions include a Mark Levinson premium stereo, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel and a power trunk lid. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS continues to offer plenty of refinement, not to mention real straight-line speed in GS F form. The GS 350’s available all-wheel drive is another bonus, especially for anyone cross-shopping this luxury sedan with a similarly posh SUV. It’s too bad the multimedia system interface is overly complicated.",
