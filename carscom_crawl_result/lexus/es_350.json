      "expert_review": "The 2017 Lexus ES 350 is about as safe a bet as you can make. Buyers will find expected amounts of luxuriousness, a perfectly plain but comfortable ride, and enough style to stand out without being polarizing. For 2017, a number of advanced safety features were added as standard equipment — for not much of a price increase.\n\nThe luxury landscape is changing now that Hyundai has launched Genesis as its own brand in the budget luxury space and the redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse benchmarked the ES 350’s ride and handling — to great success. Compare the Lexus with the Genesis G80, LaCrosse and a more traditional compact luxury offering, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, here.\n\nThe ES 350 is good, but are its changes for 2017 enough to keep up with the competition?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLexus updated the ES 350 for 2016 with more defined front styling. That minor change hit all the right marks, giving the ES 350 more on-the-road presence, with a larger version of the hourglass grille, updated headlights, foglights and edgier styling. The ES 350’s last full redesign was for the 2013 model year.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nSportiness is not the Lexus ES 350’s strongest characteristic; in fact, it doesn’t do sport well at all. You may think that’s a knock against a car priced in a range that preaches sportiness (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4), but the ES 350’s casual ride quality is refreshing. Lexus hasn’t ruined the way the ES 350 cruises down the highway by trying to make it handle well. For those who want more of a fun-to-drive car in this price range, Lexus has its IS sedan.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive-only ES 350 has a 268-horsepower V6 that’s also a no-frills experience; there’s no turbocharger or supercharger. Power comes on strong and is well-controlled by a crisp-shifting, six-speed automatic transmission. I prefer a well-built six-speed over a half-baked dual-clutch or eight-speed automatic transmission, but the ES 350’s EPA-estimated gas mileage isn’t very impressive. It’s rated just 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and that’s where small, turbocharged engines and more advanced transmissions help.\n\nWith a V6 and eight-speed automatic, the front-wheel-drive LaCrosse is rated 21/31/25 mpg, while the rear-wheel-drive C300 with a turbo four-cylinder engine is rated by the EPA at 24/34/28 mpg. The ES 350’s V-6 is, however, one of the few luxury car engines to make its advertised horsepower and fuel economy on regular gas.\n\nWhere the Lexus ES 350 could improve is its noise level. The way the tires smack the road is loud and intrusive for a luxury car, and there’s off-putting road noise as the tires hum at highway speeds. Buick benchmarked the ES 350 while developing the LaCrosse’s ride, handling and interior sound levels, and I think the LaCrosse is the better-driving car any way you slice it. The rear- or all-wheel-drive Genesis G80 (formerly the Hyundai Genesis) is also ahead of the ES 350 in terms of ride quality.\n\n$$IMAGE-9, 10, 11, 15,16,$$\n\nInterior\n\nAs the saying goes, it’s what’s on the inside that counts, and the 2017 Lexus ES 350 maintains its credibility on the inside even five years after a complete redesign. The LaCrosse doesn’t offer the same level of luxuriousness, which is appropriate considering it starts at a much more affordable price. The G80 is the closer competitor, with high-quality materials similar to the ES — and even richer in some areas, like the door panels, seats and center console. But I’m partial to the Lexus ES’ design and more intricate style choices (some say it’s busy), as I think the G80’s interior looks too old-man-ish; the ES merely rides that way.\n\nThe ES’ full-size roominess is a strong asset considering most similarly priced luxury sedans are either compact or mid-size. There’s ample room throughout the Lexus ES; backseat room is spacious, and the seating position is comfortable, but I didn’t find the front seats overly plush, like the G80’s, or as stylishly designed as the LaCrosse’s. They’re just kind of there, without any distinction in comfort or style.\n\n$$IMAGE-12,13,$$\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nIt’s about time Lexus rethinks its Remote Touch interface for controlling multimedia, navigation and radio functions. The mouse-style controller was a novelty at first, but after a few years of using it in various Lexus vehicles, I’ve had enough of the awkward interaction and cursor-driven menu system. It’s not easy to use while driving, and the big 8-inch screen isn’t a touchscreen. Of course, you wouldn’t want it to be, considering its position high atop the dashboard. Lexus added a back button for 2017, but it’s just a bandage on an ill-performing system.\n\nA bright spot of the optional multimedia system is the stereo included in the stereo/navigation package. Lexus’ Mark Levinson stereos haven’t been consistent performers from car to car, but the ES’ version has great clarity and was pleasing to my ears when listening to high-quality music.\n\n$$IMAGE-17,$$\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe ES 350’s trunk is large and usable. At 15.2 cubic feet, it’s sized similarly to the LaCrosse (15 cubic feet) and G80 (15.3 cubic feet). It’s larger than most compact luxury sedans’, like the C-Class’ 12.6 cubic feet. There isn’t a folding backseat in the ES, however, and it’s not a typical option among similarly sized sedans. The LaCrosse has a folding backseat; the G80 doesn’t.\n\nThe Lexus ES’ in-cabin storage isn’t great up front; there’s no space for a phone or pocket items other than the cupholders. It’s a similar story in the LaCrosse, but the G80 has a nifty area ahead of the gear selector for loose items.\n\nSafety\n\nThe new Lexus ES earned top crashworthiness ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. New for 2017, Lexus includes a hefty grouping of standard safety features, including forward pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control (at high speeds only) and lane departure prevention; blind spot warning is optional. A backup camera is also standard.\n\nI specify “high speeds only” for the adaptive cruise control because, unlike some adaptive systems that can bring you all the way down to a stop then restart in traffic, the ES’ system can be activated only at speeds above 30 mph. It cancels once the ES slows below 25 mph.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nWith a starting price of $39,875 (all prices include destination charges), the Lexus ES 350 represents a good value for 2017. Pricing is up only $800 from 2016, and its standard safety features are impressive — plus there’s a standard moonroof and LED headlights. The size-to-dollar ratio is full-size roominess at mid-size pricing.\n\nOur test car’s as-tested price of $46,058 is a fair representation of how to equip an ES 350, with one major exception: It didn’t have heated seats or a heated steering wheel, which I thought was blasphemy during winter in Chicago. If you do opt for the heated wheel, it only heats at the nine o’clock and three o’clock positions. The G80 has heated seats standard at its $42,350 starting price, and an Acura TLX does it at $32,950. In the ES, heated seats are available in a number of luxury and premium packages.\n\nEven with an increasing number of competitors and the Lexus ES 350 getting up there in years since its last redesign, it manages to keep its place as a dependable go-to in the luxury market.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Lexus ES 350 is considered one of the automaker’s entry-level sedans, but nothing about it felt entry-level. It was so well-equipped my grandmother was bragging to the entire East Coast that I had the “nicest Lexus on the market!” I didn’t have the heart to correct her.\n\nWhile the ES 350 was luxurious, its lack of some family-friendly features such as sufficient cupholders and storage compartments had me questioning just who their target market was for this midsize sedan.\n\nTo say it handled beautifully would be an understatement. The V-6 engine gave this mom all the pep I could want. Thankfully, braking was as effortless and smooth as accelerating. Despite my somewhat aggressive driving, I averaged around 20 mpg during my weeklong test drive.\n\nVentilated leather seats and the walnut wood-trimmed interior turned my not-so-glamorous life into something a tad more shiny. For that one week, my automotive life was almost perfect. Its solid doors reminded me that my kids in the backseat were safe, even if I should happen to speed (a little) down the freeway.\n\nThe ES 350 has a starting MSRP of $36,725. My test car was equipped with several optional features, including the Ultra Luxury Package, pushing its price up to $44,500.\n\nEXTERIOR\nLexus isn’t known for taking risks. This gives its cars, including the ES, a somewhat classic look. The ES 350 is undeniably sleek and beautiful, but it lacked that sporty, head-turning element.\n\nBecause it’s a sedan, it sits low enough to the ground that my 2-year-old could climb in and out of it by herself. However, the roofline was so low that my 9-month-old developed a permanent bruise on her forehead from me hitting her head on the door frame every time I tried to maneuver her out of her child-safety seat. Sorry ’bout that, baby.\n\nWhile deep and somewhat cavernous, the trunk was easily accessible. The trunk is sizable. It swallowed my humongous double jog stroller with room to spare. It also features a pass-through to the cabin to accommodate longer items.\n\nThe Lexus ES 350 has a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic. For the 2011 model year, the engine has been revised so it now uses regular gas. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/27 mpg city/highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe ES’ interior was so beautiful that I found myself fearing what my brood would do to it during our test drive. Luckily, it was as sturdy as it was sparkly.\n\nIn the front row, the comfy optional leather seats were heated and ventilated. Legroom wasn’t lacking as my tall husband was able to fit in the front passenger seat with a rear-facing child-safety seat behind him in the second row. However, he struggled to find a comfortable seating position because of the adjustable lumbar support.\n\nAlmost every control in the sedan is accessible by voice commands. This was novel at first, but after spending about 20 minutes (unsuccessfully) yelling in unison with my 2-year-old daughter, “Add phone,” we gave up on the voice-controlled system and went the old-school touch-screen route. The touch-screen made access to the navigation system a breeze, which made my driving experience much safer. I was no longer forced to rely on my smartphone to navigate through the Los Angeles’ convoluted freeway system. This left my hands free to drive.\n\nWhile I loved the Lexus’ interior, I definitely felt that I was not the target market. A prominent ashtray in the front row was my first tip-off. Second, was the serious lack of cupholders and bottleholders. There are two cupholders for the front row and two more in the second row’s fold-down center armrest. While that might work for two adults in the backseat, it renders them completely useless when the back row is filled with two full-size child-safety seats. Without car seats, this car could comfortably fit five people (as long as they hold their own beverages).\n\nThe cabin’s storage compartments also were less than desirable. While there was a deep center console that housed the MP3 jack and USB input, the glove compartment and door pockets were small and difficult to use. I found myself wishing that the ashtray was a multipurpose storage compartment.\n\nThe optional panoramic moonroof is a show-stopper in this car. I’m pretty sure that it stole my 2-year-old’s heart. She couldn’t get enough of it.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Lexus ES 350 has received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In IIHS’ rear crash test, the ES 350 received the second lowest score of Marginal. It received four stars out of five in a rollover crash test conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It hasn’t undergone NHTSA’s frontal and side-impact crash tests.\n\nWhile the ES 350’s backseat is spacious, it will only fit two child-safety seats. Both of my girls are in convertible car seats; when in the rear-facing position, this car seat takes up a lot of space. The front passenger seat did have to be moved forward a tad to accommodate the rear-facing convertible behind it, but there was enough legroom for my 6-foot-2-inch husband to fit comfortably in the front seat. My older daughter had plenty of legroom in the second row when she sat in her forward-facing convertible.\n\nThe ES has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. The anchors are buried in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. The seat belt buckles are on stable bases, making it easy for an older child in a booster seat to use them independently.\n\nStandard safety equipment for the 2011 Lexus ES 350 includes front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control and 10 airbags, including driver and front passenger knee airbags, side curtains for both rows and side-impact airbags for both front and outboard rear seats.\n\nOptional features include adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of a turn, Lexus’s Pre-Collision System, which retracts the front seat belts and preps the brakes if it senses a collision, and Lexus Enform and Safety Connect, an emergency communication system that comes in the form of a handy SOS button. Just knowing that help was a button push away helped put my mind at ease while driving alone with my little ones.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Lexus ES 350 here.",

      "expert_review": "When Lexus launched in 1989, it only had two models in its lineup. One of them was the ES — so the sedan has a long history with the brand, and the newly redesigned-for-2019 ES is the seventh generation of the car. It’s been changed inside and out with a new platform, new powertrains and updated styling.\n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus ES 350 and ES 300h First Drive: So Close to Greatness\n\nThe ES shares the most in common with the Toyota Avalon, which was also redesigned for 2019 — and the two share more than just a passing resemblance. They have the same wheelbase, same overall length and mechanically identical powertrains, just with some slight tuning differences.\n\nFrom the side, the two models look fairly identical, but the ES has a few styling cues that let you know it’s a Lexus — starting with the grille. Most versions of the ES come with a spindle grille with vertically oriented slats; if you opt for an F-Sport model, you’ll get a more aggressive overall look, but also a 3-D sort of chainmail mesh grille that’s more in-your-face.\n\nThe ES will be offered in gas and hybrid versions. The ES 350 gas version of the car will get a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 302 horsepower. The ES 300h features Lexus’ fourth-generation hybrid system with a total output of 215 hp, and its estimated fuel economy matches the Avalon’s at 44 mpg combined.\n\nAcceleration from the gas engine is adequate — I wouldn’t say it’s mind-blowing, and that actually makes me prefer the hybrid version because you get that big advantage of fuel economy. Now, there is one catch going with the ES: It’s going to be front-wheel drive only. Pretty much all of its other competitors offer some sort of all-wheel drive, so it’s weird that Lexus wouldn’t choose to put some kind of AWD system in the ES — and that makes it stick out for the wrong reasons.\n\nFor more info, including full driving and interior impressions, watch the video below.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Lexus promise of relentless pursuit of perfection showcases itself in the latest edition of the brand’s premium midsize sedan, the redesigned 2007 ES 350.\n\nAs well it should be, this is the best yet in a line of ES models from Lexus, near-luxury sedans derived from Toyota’s best-selling Camry.\n\nFor the new model year, both the Camry and ES 350 have received complete makeovers, and the ES gets a new name indicative of its more-powerful engine, a 3.5-liter V-6. Last year, it was the ES 330, with a 3.3-liter V-6.\n\nLaunched along with the original LS 400 luxury sedan in 1989, the first in the ES was the 250, which actually turned out to be too small for American consumers and didn’t catch on right away.\n\nConsumers liked the idea of the ES, but complained about its cramped interior. So rather quickly, Toyota developed a successor to the ES 250, called the ES 300, based on the chassis of the Camry. Since that car arrived in fall 1991 with a roomier interior and a 3.0-liter V-6 engine, the ES has been the best-seller in the Lexus sedan lineup.\n\nThe 2007 model is the fifth generation. The third generation was introduced in September 1996, then the fourth generation in September 2001.\n\nWith its close ties to the Camry since the second generation, makeovers for the ES have followed the same schedule as those of the Camry. The newest ES went on sale in late April, following the launch of the redesigned 2007 Camry in early March.\n\nThis one has a more stylish exterior than before, along with some new features, including an optional panoramic sunroof that comes close to changing the car into a hardtop convertible.\n\nIt’s larger than before, as well. The wheelbase is more than two inches longer than that of the 2006 model, and the track is more than an inch wider, which should improve roadhandling and stability.\n\nAs for the car’s reworked exterior, which includes a longer hood and shorter rear deck, Lexus says it represents the brand’s new “L-finesse” design theme, “recalling classic sports-car proportions with a contemporary look unique to all new-generation Lexus sedans.”\n\nThe extra length and width and the shorter rear deck help increase interior space, giving the passengers more room in both rows of seats. Two can sit in the front bucket seats, and three on the rear bench.\n\nBase price is $33,170 (plus $695 freight), up just $570 from the 2006 price. That’s probably a bargain considering that the car has been improved in every aspect – including comfort, safety, performance and craftsmanship, Lexus says.\n\nThere is only one trim level offered, and options are limited because the car is already very well-equipped at the base price.\n\nThe biggest option, included on our test vehicle, is the premium package ($12,80), which adds a leather-trimmed interior, as well as a memory system for the driver’s seat, outside mirrors and tilt/telescopic steering column. The only other extra on our car was a Bluetooth hands-free communications system ($300).\n\nTotal sticker for ours, including freight and options, was $35,445.\n\nThe ES has evolved to where it’s better than the original LS, company officials say. “We believe the new ES 350 is better in virtually every way than our original LS flagship sedan,” said Bob Carter, Lexus group vice president and general manager. “It’s faster, more powerful and quieter than the vehicle that redefined the prestige luxury segment in the early 1990s.”\n\nThe new engine, which is shared with the new Camry, is rated at 272 horsepower and 254 foot-pounds of torque. That puts the ES 350 into the sport sedan class, and is a hefty increase from the 225 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque in the 2006 model.\n\nThe extra power came in handy as we drove the ES on some fun, twisty Hill Country roads, but also was quite noticeable – and appreciated – on freeway on-ramps and during passing maneuvers on two-lane country roads.\n\nAdding the power was imperative as most of the ES 350’s major competitors have more than last year’s model, and some, such as the 2007 Infiniti G35 sedan (308 horsepower) have more than even the new ES.\n\nThe Cadillac CTS even comes in a 400-horsepower high-performance version, but its midlevel 3.6-liter V-6 – at 255 horsepower – now ranks below the ES 350. The TL is now in third place among these four, with 258 horsepower. (The base model of the CTS, however, has a 2.8-liter V-6 with just 210 horsepower.)\n\nSport-sedan status might still elude the ES 350 in some enthusiasts’ eyes, though, because it is the only one of these four that does not offer a manual gearbox. Lexus has no plans for a manual in the ES because the car is aimed primarily at women, who generally prefer automatic transmissions. The rear-drive Lexus IS sedan line, which is aimed at the mostly male enthusiast crowd, offers a manual gearbox in its IS 250 model.\n\nAs with the Camry, the ES 350 comes with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is not available.\n\nThe engine is connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, and the car can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds.\n\nEven with all of that power, EPA fuel-economy ratings are a decent 21 miles per gallon in the city and 30 mpg on the highway. The car’s electronic sequential fuel injection “optimizes the fuel mixture” to give improved power and fuel economy, as well as to reduce tailpipe emissions, Lexus says.\n\nSafety also has been greatly improved. Standard features include four-wheel antilock disc brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution; electronic stability and traction control; eight air bags, including side curtain bags for front and rear passengers; and a tire-pressure monitoring system. Optional are rear seat-mounted side air bags. Knee air bags are new for 2007, and are in place for both the driver and front passenger.\n\nAmong other new features are front side windows with a water-repellant surface to help keep rain from obscuring vision; a rear backup camera as part of the optional satellite navigation system; and “intelligent” adaptive front lighting, which moves the headlights slightly into the direction of the car’s turn.\n\nPremium amenities include keyless entry and start with pushbutton ignition; dual-zone automatic climate control; 10-way power front seats; auto-dimming rearview mirror with digital compass; power/heated outside mirrors; sliding center console; power tilt/telescopic steering column; one-touch power moon roof; power windows with express up and down feature for the front doors; and an illuminated entry system that includes exterior “puddle” lamps and interior cabin footwell lights.\n\nCloth upholstery is standard, but two leather seating surface upgrades are offered, including extra-soft perforated leather. The car has premium wood, polished metal and leather interior trim packages.\n\nThe steering wheel includes controls for the audio system, trip computer and multi-information display, as well as a switch for the Bluetooth hands-free phone system (if the car has it).\n\nOther standard features include a universal garage/gate opener, a stainless-steel dual exhaust system, heated power outside mirrors, and an in-dash, six-disc CD-changer with MP3/WMA playback and a jack for connection of an external MP3 player or iPod connectivity.\n\nOptional is the newest generation of the Mark Levinson premium 5.1 Surround Sound audio system with 14 speakers and 300 watts of power.\n\nThere also is a navigation system available, but it was not included on our car. The available two-section glass roof extends over almost the entire passenger cabin.\n\nThe front section is the largest, and is the only one that opens. The sunroof was not included on our test vehicle, nor were some other interesting options, include radar-based adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing front wipers, and a parking-assist system that warns the driver when the car gets too close to an object.\n\nRide quality is among the ES 350’s greatest attributes, and the cabin is among the quietest in the class.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Lexus ES 350 has undergone a significant redesign — its first since 2007. The new look is an attempt to appeal to shoppers who tend to lean German in their vehicular preferences. That means the ES is sportier and more muscular, but does it muscle out families? Mostly, the answer is no.\n\nThe 2013 Lexus ES 350 is a spacious sedan that will dazzle not just with features and technology, but with customization and connectivity.\n\nThis full-size sedan’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine has plenty of power and made use of it smoothly and effortlessly. If I wanted to ramp up the driving experience, I could switch from Normal to Sport mode with the twist of a knob. If I wanted some fuel savings, I could use the Eco mode. Ease and simplicity has a place, and the ease of driving the ES 350 made up for a lot of the interior’s complicated technology.\n\nThe 2013 ES 350 has a starting price of $36,995, including an $895 destination charge. My test car’s optional packages added nearly $10,000 to the ES for an as-tested price of $46,004. The ES 350 takes regular gas, so that helped with the sticker shock. A little.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe redesigned ES’ spindle grille looks sharp and aggressive. The sculpted lines leading back to the trunk lid make this five-seater look cool in the school drop-off lane, yet the overall appearance is not as committed to looking as mean as its competitors. That’s OK because not everyone wants to drive around looking for a fight.\n\nThis car is really kid-friendly when it comes to getting in and out of it; the rear doors are lightweight and the step-in height is low. My school-aged kids found them easy to open, but younger kids will need help with the door handles because they’re placed high up on the car’s body. Yes, the sloped roofline will be hard on your back, and yes, you will be prone to head bonks as you get the kids into their child-safety seats. But that’s only for four or five years until they can climb in and buckle up by themselves.\n\nHandily, the ES 350 had a power trunk lid. You scoff. I know it seems a bit ridiculous for a sedan to have a power trunk lid, but let me tell you, arms full of gear appreciate any help they can get, sedan or not. And if you live with one for a week, you will be sad when someone takes it away. The trunk had room for my son’s bulky hockey bag. It will fit a small stroller. It will fit a large grocery shopping trip, including a box of diapers. However, it won’t fit the hockey bag, a large grocery shopping trip, a stroller and a box of diapers all at the same time.\n\nThe 2013 ES 350 has a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine with a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 21/31 mpg city/highway and uses regular gas. The hybrid version, the ES 300h, gets 40/39 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great, for smaller ones\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe ES 350’s interior is a bit like an executive space shuttle. From my test car’s cockpit, I mean driver’s seat, technology abounds with an optional voice-activated navigation system with the Remote Touch mouselike controller, Lexus Enform multimedia system and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nIf all this seems a bit intimidating, it is. Conceptually, it’s wonderful. Using the touch-screen and the mouse, I could control the navigation system, stereo and more. If that’s not enough, all kinds of applications are available in the ES 350 using Enform’s App Suite. Pandora, OpenTable, iHeartRadio and more are offered, but it will needs your mobile phone’s data plan to work. Details, details. Unfortunately these systems still required me to take my eyes off the road more often than I’d prefer when driving.\n\nIn the backseat, my kids, ages 10 and 8, had lots of room. The seats are deep and not too bolstered. There are vents for the backseat, so occupants stay comfortable no matter the weather. In addition, there are sunshades not just on the rear window and side windows, but also the tiny triangular windows. Did I mention the optional panoramic moonroof? It’s a major plus for families; my kids particularly enjoyed car washes and night-time driving because of it.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 ES 350 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also received the highest overall safety score of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received five stars out of five in frontal and side crash tests and four stars in the rollover crash test.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the ES’ outboard seats. However, they’re somewhat buried between the seat cushions. Rear-facing child-safety seats had plenty of room in the backseat, and a booster seat fits well in the wide seats. Find out how the ES did in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe ES 350 has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control and 10 airbags, including knee airbags for the front row and side-impact airbags for the front and rear outboard passengers. Lexus’ Safety Connect emergency communication system program — including collision notification, stolen vehicle location, emergency assist and enhanced roadside assistance — is also standard.\n\nOptional safety features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, Intuitive Parking Assist and a precollision warning system.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Lexus ES350 here.",

      "expert_review": "In a segment filled with sedans trying to be overly sporty and track-ready, the 2014 Lexus ES 350 recalls classic luxury with its smooth ride and cavernous backseat.\n\nThe ES 350 is uniquely positioned within Lexus’ lineup: It’s $520 more expensive than the small and sporty IS, and about $10,000 less expensive than the large and sporty GS sedan. Oddly enough, buying the more expensive car doesn’t equal getting a roomier one, because Lexus switched the ES to the generously sized Toyota Avalon platform when it was redesigned for 2013, and backseat room grew by a considerable margin.\n\nFor 2014, Lexus allows ES 350 buyers to opt for attractive bamboo wood trim that was previously available only on the ES 300h hybrid; LED fog lights and heated and cooled seats in leatherette (imitation leather) are also new. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 here.\n\nThe ES 350 shares comfort-focused roots with fellow premium/luxury sedans like the Hyundai Genesis, Lincoln MKZ and Volvo S60; compare those with the ES 350 here.\n\nStyling\nAt a quick glance, it’s easy to mistake the ES 350 for almost any sedan in Lexus’ lineup. Lexus’ modern design is stamped onto every sedan without too much differentiation, except size and some curves here and there. One standout similarity among them all is the hourglass, “spindle” grille. The design and grille work well on the ES 350’s dynamic look that debuted with the 2013 redesign.\n\nHow It Drives\nDynamic styling doesn’t equal dynamic handling for the ES 350, and that’s not a knock against the car. I can honestly say it’s refreshing to drive a luxury sedan that’s not trying to run faster laps than the next guy, which is what a lot of the spritely, compact sport sedans in the ES 350’s price range are trying to do. The ES 350 cruises down the road like it’s always on a leisurely Sunday stroll. Those looking for a combination of dynamic driving and comfort will find more to like in the pricier Lexus GS, which starts at $48,610 including destination charge.\n\nThe ES 350’s comfortable suspension absorbs bumps well, and it takes virtually no effort to drive the car; its heavily boosted power steering requires only a single finger to turn the wheel. Driving the ES 350 at highway speeds isn’t a completely isolated experience, however, as it is in Lexus’ LS 460 flagship car or even the Hyundai Genesis sedan. Tire noise on harsh roads contributes to a noisier experience than the more prestigious Lexus and Hyundai sedans offer. You don’t feel the bumps in the ES 350, you hear them.\n\nThe 268-horsepower V-6 is potent enough and sounds surprisingly muscular for what it is. The engine gives the traction control system a good workout by frequently overpowering the tires on dry roads – cold ones, at the time of testing. There wouldn’t be as much drama, however, if the ES 350 had an optional all-wheel-drive system, as do competitors from Acura, Infiniti, BMW, Audi, Cadillac, Volvo, Mercedes and even the Lexus IS and GS. The ES 350 has front-wheel drive only.\n\nA big advantage of the ES is its silky smooth V-6, which makes its full power and EPA gas-mileage estimates on regular fuel. Other potent V-6 or turbocharged four-cylinder engines often require pricey premium gasoline for their advertised power and fuel economy. The ES 350 runs at its peak on the cheap stuff. Gas mileage is also notable for a V-6, with ratings of 21/31/24 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nInterior\nLuxury-car prices are generally commensurate with their interior size: Buy the next step up and you’ll get more room. Not so with the ES 350. The ES has almost as much room to sprawl out in the backseat as the LS 460 sedan, though the wider LS 460 has the advantage in making the backseat feel roomier, with almost two additional inches of width. The ES, however, has more rear legroom (40 inches) than the LS 460 (35.8 inches) and GS 350 (36.8 inches). Switching to the Toyota Avalon platform provided an additional 4.1 inches of rear legroom for the ES 350 versus the previous generation. Few luxury sedans provide that much backseat room for the money.\n\nUp front, though, seating comfort and adjustability isn’t as impressive. I didn’t have the lower back support I prefer, and the seats didn’t conform to my spine the same way as the ones in the GS 350 we tested at the same time did. The GS’ front seats are more contoured than the ES 350’s flat and wide ones.\n\nThe ES’ interior quality is perfectly appropriate for the class, with nice touches of high-quality materials. This is where the ES 350 is a leap ahead of the current Genesis, though a redesigned 2015 Hyundai will debut sometime in 2014. I especially liked the ES 350’s optional real bamboo wood trim, which adds an extra highlight to the inside. The bamboo trim is part of a $1,370 Luxury Package that also includes real-leather heated and cooled front seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and more.\n\nWhile nice, some say the interior is busy. The bamboo and mix of other materials and textures put off some editors who took issue with what they deemed a quality inconsistency across the range of materials. I didn’t find the spread as offensive.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nOne of the stranger areas in what’s an otherwise predictable technology experience is the ES 350’s available Remote Touch navigation controller, a mouse-like controller for using the car’s multimedia, navigation, phone and climate systems. Unlike a common rotary center control knob, the navigation controller has a mound-shaped palm rest and a finger pad on a gimbal used to skim through the various functions of the optional 8-inch navigation screen. I’m a fan of rarely having to lift a finger to work the system, though my experience seemed like a minority opinion around the water cooler.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe ES 350’s 15.2 cubic feet of trunk space is more than the pricier GS 350’s 14.3 cubic feet and similar to the MKZ’s 15.4 cubic feet and the Genesis sedan’s 15.9 cubic feet. Just like the Avalon, a small pass-through in the center of the rear seat is the only link between the cargo area and the interior space because the rear seats don’t fold flat. The Genesis sedan’s don’t fold flat either, though the MKZ’s do. We fit plenty of goods in the ES’ trunk without a folding seat, however, including grocery bags, a stroller and golf clubs with no issues. In fact, it was easier to fit those items in the ES than the GS.\n\nUp front, the center console is cluttered with items like the navigation controller and driving mode selector, so there wasn’t much storage space for all the accessories I carry around: phone, wallet, keys, music player, etc. The limited space and presence of just one cupholder in the console left me stuffing items into the car’s side pockets. It became even more difficult to find room for all the junk I carry from car to car when there was a passenger onboard with their storage needs.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 ES 350 earned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest overall crash test rating of five stars. Over at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the ES 350 was missing out on Top Safety Pick status because the small-overlap frontal crash test hadn’t been conducted at the time of this writing. The ES scored the agency’s highest rating, good, in all other tests. A blind spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is available for $500. If you add the navigation system, your car will also be equipped with Safety Connect and automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle location, an emergency assist button and roadside assistance. Click here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe ES 350’s starting price of $37,530 with destination includes imitation leather seating, a moonroof, dual climate control and the roominess of a much more expensive luxury car. With the blind spot monitor, navigation, high-intensity-discharge headlights, power rear sunshade and rain-sensing wipers, our total came to $43,605. The majority of new 2014s in Cars.com’s national inventory are listed with an asking price of $40,000-$45,000, so our tester was right in line with the majority of what’s available.\n\nEven at $43,605, you’ll be hard-pressed to find another luxury car with as much room and luxury on the inside as the ES 350.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "I never truly understood the meaning of the term “easy street” until I got behind the wheel of a Lexus ES 350. Everything in this sedan is easy, from the way it drives and handles to the stereo and climate controls. It’s easy to fall in love with, too. A car like this makes me feel mature and glamorous and all kinds of things I’m not but wish I were.\n\nThe ES is a pleasure to drive, with more power than I’d ever need and a ride that literally glides over the road. Even potholes are barely noticeable. What’s even more amazing is that, as smooth as the ride is over bumps, it tightens up in turns to keep the tires glued to the pavement. In traffic or at high speeds, the car requires almost no thought to drive. The ES 350 makes every street easy street.\n\nI was living on easy street the whole time I had the ES 350 at my disposal. As much as I enjoyed the way it drives, I also enjoyed the utility of this sedan. The huge trunk made my grocery load look minimal and would fit a couple of small bikes with no problem. The proximity key makes opening the doors and starting the car almost magical; buttons on the outside of the doors allow me to lock them as I go so I never need to find the key fob hiding in the depths of my purse. Which is good, because I really don’t want to know what else is hiding down there.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nThe incredibly quiet interior of the ES 350 is a serene haven from the chaos of life with kids. The perforated leather seats are heated and air conditioned and adjust in 10 ways, including a power lumbar support. Both front seats have three memory positions, so once you set your preference, you don’t have to worry if the guys at the carwash mess with it.\n\nThe leather on the steering wheel and gearshift is buttery soft and lovely to hold on to. One feature that never grows old for me is a power-retracting steering wheel. The wheel retracts up and away from the driver when the engine is turned off, making getting in and out a breeze. When you turn the engine back on, the wheel returns to its previous position. How helpful is that? All the controls are easily within reach, and the color touch-screen makes everything simple. Dual climate control means no fighting over the perfect temperature, and the available Mark Levinson Premium Audio Package means the soundtrack of your life happens in your own personal concert hall, even if it is just the Wiggles playing.\n\nThe backseat is roomy, with plenty of legroom for grown-up people, and it’s wide enough for three kids to buckle up without anyone getting squished. Carpool day was no hardship; even with three backpacks on the floor, everyone was happy. Perhaps the kids were just mesmerized by the giant panoramic moonroof. My test car came with two, count ’em, two sunroofs. One, over the front seat, tilts and slides open, while the other is just for the view. Both have retractable covers so you can create shade whenever you need to. For even more weather control, a power sunshade slides up the rear window at the push of a button. Of course, when the car is put into Reverse the sunshade automatically slides out of the way for an unimpeded view. Who thinks of these things? Amazing.\n\nThe ES 350 isn’t just easy to drive, it’s easy on the eyes, too. It looks rich, elegant and classy, which is more than I can say for myself. The chrome used on the grille, door handles and window trim provides just the right amount of sparkle without going over the top. With the panoramic glass roof, there’s almost a two-tone effect as the glass has a dark tint to keep things cool inside. From outside, it doesn’t look like two separate sunroofs, even though it is. It looks like the entire top of the car is made of glass. The windows are also tinted, giving the ES that Hollywood look of mystery. I mean, there must be someone important riding behind that dark glass, right? Oh, that’s right – it’s me, living on easy street! And that tint isn’t just for looks: It’s UV-reducing, so it keeps me looking as fabulous as my ride.\n\nThe doors open wide enough for little legs to climb in without an assist, and they’re easy for little hands to manage because they’re not too heavy. I found the trunklid to be surprisingly light. The mirrors are power-adjustable and have defoggers and puddle lamps that illuminate the outside of the car so you won’t step in that puddle wearing your fancy new shoes. Or in my case, flip-flops, but the benefit remains.\n\nThere are so many cool safety features in the ES 350 I could fill pages telling you about them. In fact, that’s just what Lexus does in its owner’s manual, so I’ll just hit the highlights here. Twelve airbags hide subtly inside this sedan ready, to poof out at need, but that’s not the cool part. What’s great is that the car has a sophisticated sensor system that tells it which airbags are necessary and whether or not the front passenger is tall enough to benefit from deployment. Traction and stability control systems help keep you on the road in less-than-ideal situations, and computerized braking helps during emergency braking to enhance control. There are two Latch positions that are hidden but accessible, allowing two car seats to be installed in the outboard backseat positions. Booster seats are a bit more difficult, as they tend to slide over the seat belt receptacle, making it hard for little ones to buckle themselves in.\n\nA backup camera is a big help in parking lots, as is a park-assist system that sounds a warning when the car gets too close to an obstacle, like a short wall that may not be visible from the driver’s seat. The automatic headlights sport high-intensity lamps and rotate to illuminate the road around curves. I don’t know about you, but I’ve always found it helpful to see where I’m going. Like I said, the ES 350 makes things easy.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2014 about the 2014 Lexus ES 350. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn a segment filled with sedans trying to be overly sporty and track-ready, the 2014 Lexus ES 350 recalls classic luxury with its smooth ride and cavernous backseat.\n\nThe ES 350 is uniquely positioned within Lexus’ lineup: It’s $520 more expensive than the small and sporty IS, and about $10,000 less expensive than the large and sporty GS sedan. Oddly enough, buying the more expensive car doesn’t equal getting a roomier one, because Lexus switched the ES to the generously sized Toyota Avalon platform when it was redesigned for 2013, and backseat room grew by a considerable margin.\n\nFor 2014, Lexus allows ES 350 buyers to opt for attractive bamboo wood trim that was previously available only on the ES 300h hybrid; LED fog lights and heated and cooled seats in leatherette (imitation leather) are also new. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 here.\n\nThe ES 350 shares comfort-focused roots with fellow premium/luxury sedans like the Hyundai Genesis, Lincoln MKZ and Volvo S60; compare those with the ES 350 here.\n\nStyling\nAt a quick glance, it’s easy to mistake the ES 350 for almost any sedan in Lexus’ lineup. Lexus’ modern design is stamped onto every sedan without too much differentiation, except size and some curves here and there. One standout similarity among them all is the hourglass, “spindle” grille. The design and grille work well on the ES 350’s dynamic look that debuted with the 2013 redesign.\n\nHow It Drives\nDynamic styling doesn’t equal dynamic handling for the ES 350, and that’s not a knock against the car. I can honestly say it’s refreshing to drive a luxury sedan that’s not trying to run faster laps than the next guy, which is what a lot of the spritely, compact sport sedans in the ES 350’s price range are trying to do. The ES 350 cruises down the road like it’s always on a leisurely Sunday stroll. Those looking for a combination of dynamic driving and comfort will find more to like in the pricier Lexus GS, which starts at $48,610 including destination charge.\n\nThe ES 350’s comfortable suspension absorbs bumps well, and it takes virtually no effort to drive the car; its heavily boosted power steering requires only a single finger to turn the wheel. Driving the ES 350 at highway speeds isn’t a completely isolated experience, however, as it is in Lexus’ LS 460 flagship car or even the Hyundai Genesis sedan. Tire noise on harsh roads contributes to a noisier experience than the more prestigious Lexus and Hyundai sedans offer. You don’t feel the bumps in the ES 350, you hear them.\n\nThe 268-horsepower V-6 is potent enough and sounds surprisingly muscular for what it is. The engine gives the traction control system a good workout by frequently overpowering the tires on dry roads – cold ones, at the time of testing. There wouldn’t be as much drama, however, if the ES 350 had an optional all-wheel-drive system, as do competitors from Acura, Infiniti, BMW, Audi, Cadillac, Volvo, Mercedes and even the Lexus IS and GS. The ES 350 has front-wheel drive only.\n\nA big advantage of the ES is its silky smooth V-6, which makes its full power and EPA gas-mileage estimates on regular fuel. Other potent V-6 or turbocharged four-cylinder engines often require pricey premium gasoline for their advertised power and fuel economy. The ES 350 runs at its peak on the cheap stuff. Gas mileage is also notable for a V-6, with ratings of 21/31/24 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nInterior\nLuxury-car prices are generally commensurate with their interior size: Buy the next step up and you’ll get more room. Not so with the ES 350. The ES has almost as much room to sprawl out in the backseat as the LS 460 sedan, though the wider LS 460 has the advantage in making the backseat feel roomier, with almost two additional inches of width. The ES, however, has more rear legroom (40 inches) than the LS 460 (35.8 inches) and GS 350 (36.8 inches). Switching to the Toyota Avalon platform provided an additional 4.1 inches of rear legroom for the ES 350 versus the previous generation. Few luxury sedans provide that much backseat room for the money.\n\nUp front, though, seating comfort and adjustability isn’t as impressive. I didn’t have the lower back support I prefer, and the seats didn’t conform to my spine the same way as the ones in the GS 350 we tested at the same time did. The GS’ front seats are more contoured than the ES 350’s flat and wide ones.\n\nThe ES’ interior quality is perfectly appropriate for the class, with nice touches of high-quality materials. This is where the ES 350 is a leap ahead of the current Genesis, though a redesigned 2015 Hyundai will debut sometime in 2014. I especially liked the ES 350’s optional real bamboo wood trim, which adds an extra highlight to the inside. The bamboo trim is part of a $1,370 Luxury Package that also includes real-leather heated and cooled front seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and more.\n\nWhile nice, some say the interior is busy. The bamboo and mix of other materials and textures put off some editors who took issue with what they deemed a quality inconsistency across the range of materials. I didn’t find the spread as offensive.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nOne of the stranger areas in what’s an otherwise predictable technology experience is the ES 350’s available Remote Touch navigation controller, a mouse-like controller for using the car’s multimedia, navigation, phone and climate systems. Unlike a common rotary center control knob, the navigation controller has a mound-shaped palm rest and a finger pad on a gimbal used to skim through the various functions of the optional 8-inch navigation screen. I’m a fan of rarely having to lift a finger to work the system, though my experience seemed like a minority opinion around the water cooler.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe ES 350’s 15.2 cubic feet of trunk space is more than the pricier GS 350’s 14.3 cubic feet and similar to the MKZ’s 15.4 cubic feet and the Genesis sedan’s 15.9 cubic feet. Just like the Avalon, a small pass-through in the center of the rear seat is the only link between the cargo area and the interior space because the rear seats don’t fold flat. The Genesis sedan’s don’t fold flat either, though the MKZ’s do. We fit plenty of goods in the ES’ trunk without a folding seat, however, including grocery bags, a stroller and golf clubs with no issues. In fact, it was easier to fit those items in the ES than the GS.\n\nUp front, the center console is cluttered with items like the navigation controller and driving mode selector, so there wasn’t much storage space for all the accessories I carry around: phone, wallet, keys, music player, etc. The limited space and presence of just one cupholder in the console left me stuffing items into the car’s side pockets. It became even more difficult to find room for all the junk I carry from car to car when there was a passenger onboard with their storage needs.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 ES 350 earned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest overall crash test rating of five stars. Over at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the ES 350 was missing out on Top Safety Pick status because the small-overlap frontal crash test hadn’t been conducted at the time of this writing. The ES scored the agency’s highest rating, good, in all other tests. A blind spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is available for $500. If you add the navigation system, your car will also be equipped with Safety Connect and automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle location, an emergency assist button and roadside assistance. Click here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe ES 350’s starting price of $37,530 with destination includes imitation leather seating, a moonroof, dual climate control and the roominess of a much more expensive luxury car. With the blind spot monitor, navigation, high-intensity-discharge headlights, power rear sunshade and rain-sensing wipers, our total came to $43,605. The majority of new 2014s in Cars.com’s national inventory are listed with an asking price of $40,000-$45,000, so our tester was right in line with the majority of what’s available.\n\nEven at $43,605, you’ll be hard-pressed to find another luxury car with as much room and luxury on the inside as the ES 350.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a five-seat mid-size luxury sedan that comes in gas (ES 350) and gas-electric hybrid (ES 300h) form. The ES 350 is powered by a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the ES 300h’s hybrid drivetrain features a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with total system output of 215 hp. Both models have front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Acura TLX and Lincoln MKZ.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nAndroid Auto smartphone connectivity joins Apple CarPlay, and most versions of the ES now have power-folding side mirrors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning with steering assist. Available features include heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES is a distinctively styled luxury sedan, and while the addition of Android Auto is welcome, the car’s Remote Touch multimedia system interface remains a frustration. The hybrid’s estimated gas mileage is underwhelming, too.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chrysler 300, Genesis G80, Toyota Avalon\n\nLooks like: A dead ringer for … the 2020 ES\n\nPowertrain: Newly available 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and eight-speed automatic transmission (ES 250 AWD); 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic (ES 350); 215-system-hp, 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder and electric motor with continuously variable automatic (ES 300h)\n\nHits dealerships: Early fall\n\nLexus redesigned its ES sedan for the 2019 model year, giving it a more aggressive-looking design that uses the brand’s signature spindle grille. For 2020, Lexus added Android Auto smartphone connectivity as well as blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert as a stand-alone option. Now in this generation’s third model year, the 2021 ES gains a new ES 250 AWD powered by a four-cylinder engine and paired with all-wheel drive, as well as a new Black Line Special Edition.\n\nRelated: Volvo and Hyundai Are Tops, Tesla Not Too Shabby in J.D. Power Tech Survey\n\nExterior\n\nThe ES retains its same dimensions and basic styling regardless of model, including the signature spindle grille with trim-specific patterns — mesh made of interlocking L’s for F Sport models and vertical bars for non-F Sport versions.\n\nThe new Black Line Special Edition, based on the ES 350 F Sport, offers some cosmetic changes, including black side mirrors, “darkened” F Sport wheels and a black rear lip spoiler.\n\nInterior\n\nChanges are minimal inside, as well. Ultra Luxury models will get a new semi-aniline leather upholstery and wood trim combination of Rich Cream leather and Espresso wood. Base, Luxury and F Sport models use faux leather upholstery, and the Black Line model will feature an F Sport-specific two-tone white and black interior.\n\nEngine, Transmission and Fuel Economy\n\nMost significantly, the ES is now available in an all-wheel-drive variant, the ES 250, which can be had in all standard ES trims, including the F Sport. The ES 250 AWD is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The newly available smaller engine makes 203 hp and, even with the added weight of AWD, Lexus estimates the ES 250 AWD offers the best fuel economy of any gas-only ES at 28 mpg combined.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6-powered ES 350, meanwhile, offers 26-mpg ratings estimates to go with its 302 hp. It’s also paired to an eight-speed auto but only powers the front wheels. \n\nFor the more eco-minded buyer, there’s the hybrid ES 300h, pairing a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and battery pack for 215 total system hp. The ES 300h now uses a lithium-ion battery pack instead of a nickel-metal pack, and the battery has been relocated from the trunk to below the rear seat. Lexus says this benefits trunk space and the car’s weight distribution, improving handling.\n\nBoth the ES 250 AWD and ES 350 are available in F Sport trim, which adds an adaptive suspension and 19-inch wheels to both models.\n\nSafety\n\nThe previously available blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard on all ES models except the base, and the Lexus Safety System Plus 2.0 suite of advanced safety tech is standard on all models.\n\nLSS Plus 2.0 includes forward collision detection and automatic emergency braking, including daytime bicyclist detection and day- and nighttime pedestrian detection. It also adds other features including adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with lane keep assist and a lane trace assist feature that can work with the adaptive cruise control for a semi-autonomous driving experience.\n\nRelease Date\n\nThe 2021 Lexus ES should arrive at Lexus dealerships in early fall.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Lexus ES sedan, along with the LS sedan, dates back as long as the Lexus brand itself, to 1989. Nearly three decades later, the ES is still kicking, but not well — the 2018 model proved the car was in dire need of an update. \n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus ES: More Sass, More Class\n\nI wrote last year that I preferred the new 2018 Toyota Camry to a 2018 ES 350 even though the Camry cost about 10 grand less as tested. Luckily, both gas (ES 350) and hybrid (ES 300h) versions of the ES get a full redesign for 2019. \n\nThe changes are familiar; many of them echo the updates to the 2019 Toyota Avalon I tested earlier this year that improved it vastly over its predecessor. Would the ES make the same leap? I headed to a national media introduction Nashville, Tenn., to find out (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events). \n\nHow It Drives\n\nGone is the sedate, calculated look of the old car. It’s replaced by a heavy dose of Lexus’ signature spindle grille and an elongated profile that gives it sleeker proportions. One could look at the aggressive new styling and think that it’s going to be sporty; this was part of Lexus’ effort to remake the car as more of a sports sedan. But I didn’t end up buying it — this car is still destined to be a cruiser, which it’s great at, but it’s no sport sedan. There isn’t quite enough power, and even the F Sport version (a first for the ES) suffers from the same problem as the Avalon Touring, which also has the adaptive suspension. Even with the car cranked all the way up to the Sport Plus mode (unique to the F Sport), there isn’t enough differentiation, and though the ride is firmer, it doesn’t seem to pay real dynamic dividends.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe ES’ powertrains are mechanically identical to those found in the 2019 Avalon and Avalon Hybrid, which also share the ES’ global GA-K platform. That means the ES 350 features a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 267 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic. The Lexus ES 300h combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a pair of electric motor/generators to produce 215 hp. A continuously variable automatic transmission is standard on the hybrid. \n\nThe updated ES rides more confidently and has significantly improved steering feel and feedback over the previous ES, a sloppy-driving car that drifted around on the highway and wallowed in corners. Despite a few unique suspension tricks and some tuning differences, the driving experience in both models of the ES is very similar to what you get in the Avalon, which is a good thing. \n\nIt’s not an identical experience, however. I noticed it the most under heavy braking when the ES remained firmly planted down to a stop, a circumstance under which the Avalon’s tail gets a little wiggly. Differences between the Toyota and Lexus may come from steps taken to increase the ES’ structural rigidity, including an added brace behind the backseats and additional structural adhesives and laser screw welds. For whatever good it might do, the added brace means the rear seats won’t fold down; all you get is a small center-seat pass-through that won’t accommodate an object as wide as a snowboard.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 300h | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nBoth models come with front-wheel drive only, though the ES’ luxury competitors offer all-wheel drive. When I asked Lexus about this, representatives said that the matter was “under study,” but it’s a big omission, especially for those living in the northern part of the U.S.\n\nIt’s worth calling out the fuel efficiency of the ES 300h, which doesn’t have official EPA figures yet but which Lexus estimates as 44/45/44 mpg city/highway/combined, a serious step up from the previous generation’s 40/39/40 mpg. Mileage remains substantially more efficient than the gas-only ES 350, which for 2019 Lexus estimates at 22/33/26 mpg, itself an increase over the 2018’s 21/30/24 mpg EPA rating. \n\nIn the Cabin\n\nInside, there are big improvements to both the styling and materials in both the front and rear. It’s now a thoroughly modern cabin, with an available 12.3-inch multimedia display and plenty of charging options (including a pair of USB ports and a 12-volt port behind the center storage bin). Buyers who opt for the F Sport version are treated to a pair of excellent front sport seats.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nAdditional sound deadening throughout keeps the ES’ cabin serene, in both gas and hybrid guise. Hybrid models get even more sound deadening, including extra three-layered padding at the firewall that’s designed to keep out high-pitched noises from the electric components. It is effective: I didn’t notice as much whine from the electric motor, but a lot of unpleasant four-cylinder noise still comes through. Even the V-6 in the ES 350 sounds tame, and though F Sport models supposedly pipe in engine sounds to the cabin artificially, it didn’t register with me (even with the radio off).\n\nSafety features have also gotten a bump. The ES comes with the Lexus Safety System Plus 2.0 which adds lane-tracing assist (an enhanced lane keep assist system that centers the car more accurately in its lane), low-light pedestrian detection, bicyclist detection and the ability to read road signs. \n\nMultimedia Struggles\n\nThe 2019 ES fixes many problems that plagued the previous versions of the car, but one big problem remains unanswered: the multimedia system.\n\nBesides the larger screen, the new system replaces Lexus’ mouselike controller with a touchpad. The touchpad isn’t an improvement; as in past Lexus vehicles, I just can’t use the system safely while driving. The menu structure is unintuitive, many common features are buried in submenus that require you to move the cursor long distances and the split-screen views often get jumbled up.\n\nLexus needs to take a cue from Apple CarPlay, which seems to work much better than the Lexus portion of the multimedia system. When activated, it uses the whole width of the screen and puts commonly used features as icons on the display. That makes it easier to get to the apps or functionality you’re looking for, which is a big part of making the whole kit and caboodle easier to use.\n\nApple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa Not Ready for Launch\n\nThere are caveats regarding both Apple CarPlay and the new Amazon Alexa connectivity when the ES launches. Lexus says that Apple CarPlay will be included initially on ES models equipped with optional navigation but not those without it until models built starting in October. With the car’s launch scheduled for September, that means there will be some models that come without it. A representative said the vast majority of cars will be equipped with navigation, and those without it will number in the single-digit percentages of the 50,000 or so ES sedans Lexus expects to sell in the first year (a little journalist math tells us that’s around 4,500 vehicles). Cars that come without Apple CarPlay cannot add it later. You’ll be stuck without it, so if you find yourself at a dealership and aren’t certain, test the system with your phone or look for the date of manufacture on a sticker on the driver’s doorjamb.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 300h | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe Amazon Alexa integration also has a catch. For those who want to get the full use of the integration through the Lexus + Alex app (which is required along with the Lexus Enform app), it will be available only on Android phones as of launch. Lexus said the iPhone app won’t appear in the App Store until late 2018. Once the app is released for iPhones, the system will also need to be updated to get the integration to work fully. Lexus is not yet sure if the update will be over the air or if it will require a stop at the dealership. And remember: If you want to take full advantage of the Alexa capability, you’ll need an Amazon account with other subscriptions, like Amazon unlimited music.\n\nLexus also didn’t offer a timeframe for potential Android Auto integration, which remains a bummer.\n\nVersus the Avalon and Luxury Competitors\n\nI deemed the 2019 Avalon a “road trip hero,” but that title may already be ceded to the 2019 Lexus ES. Its incrementally improved ride quality and composure plus better cabin materials and safety features give it some clear advantages over the Avalon, not to mention that fact that the ES looks better, too.\n\nThen again, the Avalon comes with Apple CarPlay standard, with no delay, and has a multimedia system that doesn’t make me want to punch a hole in the center console. And that’s enough to make me unsure of which I actually prefer out of the two.\n\nLooking at the price difference between the two further complicates things. Lexus would only say that the ES 350 will have a starting price of around $39,000, with ES 300h hybrid trim models commanding a $3,000 premium over the gas-only versions. (Avalon Hybrid models are only $1,000 more than their gasoline counterparts.) This puts the ES in fairly close competition to the Avalon, which starts at $36,420 and tops out at $43,120 for Touring models. That’s not much of a gap, so it might just come down to what you find most important. The multimedia edge goes to Avalon, the luxury edge to the ES.\n\nThe ES has more value when you start to compare it beyond the Avalon. Its price fits in between the compact and mid-size luxury classes while providing nearly full-size cabin space. More size for less dollars is not a bad proposition.\n\nThe ES’ multimedia drawbacks aren’t novel; I’ve encountered them in other Lexus vehicles. But it sticks out more in the ES because the rest of the car is so dramatically improved. The 2019 ES is this one change away from getting a full-throated recommendation from me — it would be a big change, admittedly, but something needs to be done. \n\nWe’ll have more details on the pricing and technology updates for the ES 350 and ES 300h as we get closer to the car’s on-sale date in September.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A new touchscreen for multimedia and vehicle controls makes the 2022 Lexus ES 350 a much better option than previous versions.\n\nVersus the competition: In a class of small, sporty luxury sedans, the ES 350 remains a comfy, quiet option best experienced in its non-F Sport versions.\n\nIncremental changes have kept the Lexus ES sedan fresh since its 2019 model-year redesign, including a four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive ES 250 in 2021. But the 2022 ES is the best version yet — and it didn’t take an entire redesign or even a significant refresh to get there; all it took was a touchscreen.\n\nRelated: Updated 2022 Lexus ES Addresses One of Its Greatest Misses\n\nFinally, a Touchscreen\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOver years and through generations of Lexus ES sedans, drivers primarily controlled the car’s multimedia and other features through a wonky touchpad controller or a polarizing joystick. I preferred the 2014-18 joystick over the more recent touchpad, but neither was great.\n\nThe redesigned 2022 Lexus NX SUV got a whole new touchscreen system, and while the 2022 ES has kept its touchpad controller, its best upgrade is a new touchscreen to replace the previous non-touch display. It gives the ES 250 and ES 350 the usability we expect from a new car, including the ability to use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as they’re intended: by touch. Apple CarPlay even stretches across the whole screen, which isn’t a given with the proliferation of large screens in cars these days. I tested a top Ultra Luxury trim of the ES 350, and its 12.3-inch touchscreen was high-resolution and high-quality, with the same crisp graphics it had before to go along with its new touchscreen functionality — prompting a big sigh of relief. (A smaller 8-inch touchscreen is standard.)\n\nIn transforming its display to a touchscreen, Lexus positioned the new unit 4.3 inches closer to the driver than was the outgoing non-touchscreen. It’s a noticeable shift that puts the screen right at arm’s length. The Lexus RX 350 SUV received a similar update for 2020, but the screen remained a bit too far away for easy reach. That’s not the case in the ES. It’s like the manual transmission gearshift on a Mazda MX-5 Miata: exactly where you want and expect it to be.\n\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nA lowly touchscreen may not seem like much, but it’s done away with the ES’ biggest red flag: The touchpad that was the primary controller before the touchscreen was truly hard to use while driving, requiring more steps than simply touching a screen, and it was inconsistent in its movement and activation. If you did like the touchpad controller (and I say “you,” singular, because that’s how many fans of it I think there are out there), know that it’s sticking around for now. Areas that still need improvement are the backup camera and 360-degree camera system displays. For how high-quality the native graphics are, the 360-degree camera system display lacks clarity, and its images stretch unnaturally across the screen.\n\nWhat Else Changed?\n\nThe rest of the ES is relatively unchanged, with respectable size and interior quality for the money. You can read our thoughts on its interior space and quality in our original review of the redesigned ES, as well as our review of the new-for-2021 ES 250 F Sport. While the touchscreen is the most notable change for 2022, there are some other ones, including additional standard safety features thanks to the inclusion of Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 (replacing the 2.0 version), which adds blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert to the automaker’s suite of standard safety features. The new standard features were optional on base trims of the 2021 ES but standard on all others.\n\nOther additions to Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 include camera and radar enhancements that open up some newly available functions, including Intersection Turning Assist. In certain situations, this feature can identify an oncoming car or pedestrian and apply precollision system warnings and intervention. The adaptive cruise control feature adds Curve Speed Reduction to slow the vehicle through tight curves, and the lane-centering function is said to have better course recognition than the past version. In my testing, however, the lane-centering system was inconsistent when it came to keeping the car in a single position in a lane, and it often held uncomfortably to the right side of the lane.\n\nThe brake pedal is larger, and the brake system’s master cylinder and brake booster have been updated for more linear brake pedal feel and response; the previous braking system didn’t bother me, but if it did you, it might be worth revisiting.\n\nOn the outside, every trim except the F Sport gets a newly styled front grille. The car I tested had a grille with additional horizontal slots versus the 2021 version, breaking up the former grille’s humpback whale vibes. Also, the ES 300h hybrid gains the F Sport treatment for the first time.\n\nES 350: The Best ES\n\nF Sport is a sleek, attractive package that gives the ES a healthy dose of aggressive looks, but  its ride harshness and unique suspension tuning — even with the optional adjustable-firmness shock absorbers — make any handling gains not worth the price of admission. With the sporty GS sedan no longer available, the ES F Sport does have a place — but its looks, ironically, will be the driving factor for buyers, not how it drives. The base-suspension ES 350 exudes classiness and composure in its ride at highway speeds, and it accelerates with refined smoothness from its silky 302-horsepower V-6; the F Sport degrades some of that smooth ride.\n\nWhen I reviewed a then-new 2021 ES 250 F Sport — a four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive ES — I was disappointed in its acceleration and the wheeziness of the four-cylinder. Driving this ES 350 a year later validated my belief that the ES 350 remains the ES to buy — unless you absolutely need all-wheel drive — especially considering it has exactly the same starting price as the ES 250: $41,875, including destination fee. That pricing parallels what’s available in Cars.com’s national inventory: The average ES 350 listing price was $47,373 in November 2021, while the average list price for the ES 250 was $46,807, though there were only 291 of those cars in our inventory versus 2,448 ES 350s (meaning you have a better chance of finding an ES 350 anyway).\n\nIt’s a shame the ES 350 remains front-wheel-drive only because its front wheels are easily overpowered by its punchy V-6 engine. It’s the V-6 that needs all-wheel drive to retain the ES’ acceleration and pleasing engine soundtrack. The traction control does a fine job slowing the car’s wheel speed, but it notably hampers acceleration because it often has to work overtime: With all traction assistance off, the ES 350 blazes its tires.\n\nGiven my complaints about the V-6’s limited traction, it may sound contradictory to say I prefer the ES 350 over the ES 250 AWD. Easy enough solution, right? Buy the 250 and its AWD. But most of the times you think you need AWD, you could likely get by with a set of dedicated winter tires, and when you’re not digging out of the snow, the V-6 is simply the more appropriate — and more enjoyable — engine for the ES.\n\nMore From Cars.com:  \n\nHere Are 5 Great Affordable Luxury Cars You Can Buy Right Now\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2022?\nHere’s Every Car That Earned an IIHS Top Safety Award for 2021\n2021 Lexus ES Offers AWD, Smaller Engine and Black Line Special Edition\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Lexus ES 350?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A 2022 update gave the Lexus ES a long-awaited touchscreen along with improved safety features. For 2023, the brand’s bestselling sedan returns with a new multimedia system, redesigned center console and updated F Sport models. These changes come with a larger price tag for each of the three powertrain variants: the six-cylinder 350, four-cylinder 250 and 300h four-cylinder hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus ES 350 Review: Now More Reasons to Buy\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 ES uses the latest version of the Lexus Interface multimedia system, featuring a higher resolution touchscreen and antiglare technology, as well as standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition to its welcomed touchscreen functionality, the system comes with an advanced voice assistant that makes voice controls more intuitive, says Lexus. Additionally, the ES is eligible for Lexus’ new 10-year trial period for the brand’s connected services plans.\n\nThe interior’s other updates include new trim options and a redesigned center console. Ash bamboo trim is added to previously available open-pore brown walnut and open-pore black options, and a new Macadamia interior color replaces Rich Cream. The center console also is updated with a new sunglass holder and cupholders, plus wireless charging.\n\nF Sport Selections\n\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nWhile the F Sport trim isn’t new to the ES, Lexus has expanded the options for 2023. Previously, all three powertrain variants offered an F Sport model with unique exterior and interior styling elements for a sportier look; however, only the 350 came with an available F Sport Dynamic Handling Package for performance-oriented distinctions. Now, Lexus has split up its F Sport offerings into two separate trims: F Sport Design and F Sport Handling.\n\nThe F Sport Design can be had with all powertrain options. Mainly an appearance package with some interior upgrades, the F Sport Design adds 19-inch gloss-black alloy wheels; a unique front bumper, grille surround and rear spoiler; and standard collision warning. Shoppers looking for sportier performance will find it in the F Sport Handling variant that replaces the Dynamic Handling Package. In addition to the visual elements of the F Sport Design, the F Sport Handling offers standard Sport Plus and Custom drive modes as well as an F Sport-tuned adaptive variable suspension. It can now be found on the 350 and 300h.\n\nIn addition to the exterior cues outlined above, F Sport models add interior upgrades like a premium Mark Levinson sound system, a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen, a head-up display, panoramic roof, and power open and close trunk with a kick sensor.\n\nPowertrain Trio\n\nThe three available powertrains for the ES carry over from 2022. The ES 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive; the ES 350 gets a 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic that only comes with front-wheel drive; and the ES 300h pairs a four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a continuously variable automatic for a combined 215 hp and FWD exclusively.\n\nTech and Safety\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new multimedia system in the ES is accessed through a standard 8-inch touchscreen or an available 12.3-inch display. The Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 suite is once again standard and includes advanced driver-assist features like blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. In the 2022 update, the system received camera and radar enhancements, new Intersection Turning Assist and Emergency Steering Assist features plus improved adaptive cruise control.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Lexus ES is on sale now. Full pricing for each variant is as follows:\n\nES 350\n\nBase: $42,490\nLuxury: $47,660\nF Sport Design: $47,075\nF Sport Handling: $48,950\nUltra Luxury: $51,280\n\nES 250\n\nBase: $42,490\nLuxury: $47,660\nF Sport Design: $47,075\nUltra Luxury: $51,280\n\nES 300h\n\nBase: $43,690\nLuxury: $48,860\nF Sport Design: $48,075\nF Sport Handling: $49,985\nUltra Luxury: $52,480\n\nThe starting price for the gas-only 350 and 250 models climbs $615 from 2022, while the 300h hybrid starts at $43,690 and sees a $715 price bump.

      "expert_review": "Is the Lexus ES 350 a Good Luxury Sedan?\n\nDespite its dated styling, the 2025 Lexus ES 350 makes an excellent case for the plush, comfortable and coddling luxury sedan — attributes many competitors have abandoned in favor of technology and sportiness.\n\nHow Does the Lexus ES 350 Compare With Other Luxury Sedans?\n\nSofter, quieter and calmer than just about any other mid-size luxury sedan on the market, the ES 350 knows what its audience wants, and it delivers. There’s no pretense of lapping the Nurburgring in record time here, just cushy, sedate, cruiser-style pampering.\n\nThere was a time when a luxury car was meant to be soft. It didn’t need a suggestion of sportiness; there was no requirement for it be a sharp-handling, overpowered, technology-laden rocket ship that had to pass muster on tracks and canyon roads. It just had to be more comfortable, more quiet, more luxurious and more exclusive than a normal family vehicle. Somewhere along the way, though, that idea got lost as automakers started to deliver sports sedans along with sports coupes … then sporty SUVs and sporty everything else. \n\nDespite having the word “sport” in its name, the 2025 Lexus ES 350 F Sport is not a sports sedan. It’s an old-school cruiser, a throwback to when “luxury” meant coddling and pampering occupants, not delivering three levels of electronically controlled suspension firmness and adjustable exhaust noises. This Lexus isn’t happiest being flogged on a back road; it’s much more at home cruising serenely down boulevards, commuting to the law firm or shuttling to a golf course. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that: The ES 350 is an old-school luxury sedan — maybe the last of a dying breed.\n\nRelated: Back to Black: 2025 Lexus ES Priced From $43,190, Black Line Special Edition Returns\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Lexus ES Cost?\n\nLexus’ mid-size sedan sits between the smaller, sportier, rear-wheel–drive-based IS and the larger LS full-size sedan. It’s offered with a choice of three powertrains: a gas four-cylinder engine with standard all-wheel drive (ES 250), a gas V-6 with front-wheel drive (ES 350) and a gas-electric hybrid with FWD (ES 300h). The car also comes in several trim levels, adding more luxurious trimmings (Luxury and Ultra Luxury), sporty looks (F Sport Design) or sporty looks plus sporty suspension tuning (F Sport Handling). All prices below include a $1,295 destination fee:\n\nES 250 AWD\n\nBase: $43,435\nF Sport Design: $48,020\nLuxury: $48,605\nUltra Luxury: $52,325\n\nES 350\n\nBase: $43,435\nF Sport Design: $48,020\nLuxury: $48,605\nF Sport Handling: $49,895\nUltra Luxury: $52,325\n\nES 300h\n\nBase: $44,835\nF Sport Design: $49,220\nLuxury: $50,005\nF Sport Handling: $51,130\nUltra Luxury: $53,725\n\nThat’s a long, long list of possible models, trims and configurations, but Lexus tends to bundle options into these trim levels, so very few stand-alone options are available. Also note that similar ES 250 and ES 350 variants are identically priced, so your choice there will come down to whether you want a FWD model with a more powerful V-6 or an AWD model with a more efficient four-cylinder. The hybrid ES 300h is a bit more expensive than the conventional gas-powered 250 and 350.\n\nStyling Is No Longer Outrageous\n\nWhen Lexus started using its “spindle-grille” look, most folks denounced it as odd and unappealing. The company has toned it down a bit over the years, while its competitors have taken their front-end styling in even odder directions (hello, BMW 3 and 4 Series). For whatever reason, the ES doesn’t look as bizarre and outrageous as it used to. It’s a clean look — swoopy and clearly inspired by the one truly gorgeous car in the Lexus lineup: the LC 500 coupe and convertible. The ES is related to the Toyota Camry, but Lexus stylists have done an excellent job differentiating it from its more pedestrian cousin; you wouldn’t know the two vehicles were related from a casual glance. Still, while the ES is no longer offensive to behold, it’s not distinctive anymore, either. That’s poised to change for the 2026 model year, however, as the ES receives a radical redesign that promises to make its styling controversial once again.  \n\nAdequately Powered\n\nMy test vehicle was a loaded ES 350 F Sport Handling with the big 3.5-liter V-6 and a special handling package meant to impart some sportiness and athleticism. In practice, it achieves neither of those things, but I ain’t mad about it. \n\nAcceleration with the 302-horsepower V-6 is smooth and strong, moving this mid-size sedan through traffic with ease whether it’s powering its way onto a highway or loping along on a moderate-speed boulevard. It’s an example of using an old-school, non-turbocharged, large-displacement V-6 simply for the purpose of having a nice well of power to draw from. There’s no frenetic revving and no need for big downshifts from the eight-speed automatic transmission. The powertrain is just well matched to its application, and we’ll miss it when Lexus ditches it for more electrification in the next-generation ES: The redesigned lineup will offer gas-electric hybrid and all-electric powertrains. The current ES 350 is quiet, too, but that’s as much a feature of its copious sound insulation as it is engine refinement. \n\nF Sport Looks, F It Handling\n\nIt’s the “Sport” moniker I object to with the ES — there’s nothing sporty going on in the handling department. The electronically controlled adaptive suspension offers a glass-smooth ride; it’s astonishingly isolated for a car this size, riding on 19-inch wheels and tires. It feels like a full-size limousine — like the bigger LS sedan — as far as ride and handling go. There’s not much feel or feedback from the steering wheel, and it doesn’t take much heft or effort to turn it, either, even when it’s in Sport or Sport+ mode to make full use of the car’s Adaptive Variable Suspension.\n\nThe brakes aren’t particularly grabby or firm, the suspension isn’t stiff or communicative, and there’s a decent amount of body roll in sweeping corners. This is definitely a cruiser, a highway touring car meant for eating up mile after mile of interstate with grace and serenity. Nobody purchases an ES thinking it’s going to be an entertaining sports sedan — the smaller IS capably fills that role for Lexus (for now). The ES F Sport is really more about looks than any substantive sporting ability, and while I think that’s a little disingenuous, you can’t deny the comfort and all-around pleasantness the ES delivers. Don’t ask the ES 350 F Sport Handling to dance and it won’t disappoint you. \n\nDated but Comfy Interior\n\nThe interior of the ES 350 F Sport Handling displays some of the racier looks in the lineup, with an available two-tone interior in black and white faux leather that looks a little out of place in a Lexus — and more than a little dated overall. From the gauges to the patterns and textures, it’s well built and high-quality, just rather stale. \n\nOne welcome holdout in the interior is the presence of actual physical buttons for things like the climate controls and other features. This won’t be the case in the next-generation ES, which will have more touch-based controls, so we’re going to enjoy them for now; you can’t beat managing your car’s features by feel alone, without having to look at the control itself, as you have to do with touch-based ones. Even the steering wheel is the old-school Lexus type, with more hard buttons instead of the latest touch-sensitive panels. It’s still a winner in my book.\n\nThere are some modern features in the 2025 ES, like an available 12.3-inch center touchscreen running the latest Lexus multimedia system, which is a reskinned version of the Toyota system. It works well enough, but it’s not exactly class-leading due to lacking some user-friendly features — like a home screen that can display multiple things at once. Thankfully, it offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should you want to use something more familiar to you. \n\nThe ES 350 F Sport Handling does have the silly, mechanically moving gauge cluster you’ll also see in the IS sedan, which changes up the display depending on drive mode and whether or not you’ve selected adjustments using the steering-wheel controls. It’s cool for about 2 seconds, then you think about how a few years from now it’s likely to be a broken feature that will be expensive to replace. \n\nEven so, the ES’ interior is really designed for comfort, despite its creative trim pieces. The seats are cushy instead of firm, with mild bolsters. The backseat is acceptable, but like the Camry, a low roofline makes getting in and out of the backseat a little challenging for bigger people. Overall, the cabin experience is one of luxurious isolation wrapped in questionable color schemes. \n\nIf I were buying an ES, however, I would not pick an F Sport Handling (or any F Sport) version. Given the ES is far more skewed toward comfort, the Ultra Luxury trim feels more in keeping with its mission. \n\nNot Yet Overpriced\n\nMy loaded ES 350 F Sport Handling’s sticker price came to $56,850, including options and destination. In the pantheon of luxury sedans, that’s not bad at all. The ES is the size of a BMW 5 Series, it comes with a lot of standard equipment, and it offers comfort and ease of use that many competing luxury brands do not. It relishes in being a beacon of old-school calmness and comfort, not a sports sedan, and its buyers appreciate it for that. The next-generation ES will be a massive departure from what you see here, so if a comfortable, traditional-style mid-size luxury sedan is appealing to you, you should grab a ‘25 Lexus ES soon.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Lexus ES Up Close: Brave New World\nResearch the 2025 Lexus ES 350\nResearch Lexus Models\nShop for a 2025 Lexus ES 350 Near You\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a mid-size luxury sedan that coddles you with its quiet cabin and, when equipped with its available V-6, surprisingly quick acceleration. Motivating the base ES 250 is a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive; we think the optional 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the ES 350, however, is more in keeping with this sedan’s luxury image and overall refinement. Also offered is an ES 300h hybrid variant that delivers 215 hp and an EPA-estimated 44 mpg in combined city/highway driving. ES competitors include the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES gets available 18-inch wheels in a Vapor Chrome finish, along with a Technology Package that bundles previously available features.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nFaux leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nMoonroof\n10-speaker audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHead-up instrument display\nWireless device charging\n17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power trunk lid\nSurround-view parking camera\nAmbient lighting\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather upholstery\nInterior wood trim\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES family is a smart choice for luxury sedan shoppers who prioritize comfort and quality. While the standard four-cylinder engine keeps the price low (and comes standard with AWD), the available V-6 is simply the better choice. It offers seamless acceleration and operates in near silence. Cabin quality is another aspect of the ES range that deserves high praise; there are soft-touch surfaces and nicely damped controls everywhere you look (and touch). True, the ES is not a particularly sporty ride even in its optional F Sport trim, but its overall refinement, ample feature content and strong safety scores make the ES worth a test drive.",
