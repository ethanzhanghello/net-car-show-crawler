      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Lexus UX 250h hybrid subcompact SUV drives like a small hatchback and has great gas mileage estimates, but a small cargo area limits its utility. \n\nVersus the competition: Other small luxury SUVs from Audi, BMW and Volvo actually look more like SUVs, but none of them can touch the UX 250h’s exceptional fuel economy. \n\nSome so-called SUVs stretch the definition more than most, and the 2020 Lexus UX 250h “SUV” is one of them. With a low ride height, hatchback shape and carlike ride and handling, the UX 250h doesn’t feel or look like an SUV. While calling it one may be the right marketing move in the hatchback-averse U.S. — and it does have all-wheel drive, unlike the front-drive-only UX 200 — Lexus isn’t fooling anyone. \n\nRelated: 2019-2020 Lexus UX: Everything You Need to Know\n\nThe UX 250h starts at $35,525 (including a $1,025 destination charge), but we tested a top-of-the-line Luxury trim level, which starts at more than $40,000. Optional features on the car we drove included a head-up display, triple-beam LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, rear automatic braking and a heated steering wheel, increasing its as-tested price to $44,555.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe UX 250h is powered by a gas-electric hybrid powertrain that makes 181 total horsepower. Instead of a driveshaft connecting the hybrid system under the hood to the rear axle, there’s an electric motor driving the rear wheels, which gives the UX 250h all-wheel drive. The setup is rated an EPA-estimated 41/38/39 mpg city/highway/combined — considerably better than the gas mileage estimates of AWD versions of the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Volvo XC40, none of which offer a hybrid drivetrain. \n\nThe UX 250h is decently quick, accelerating up to highway speeds without much fuss. Its 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine, however, doesn’t sound great in the process; it’s as if there were an angry blender under the hood. High-speed passing power is modest, but the UX 250h’s hybrid drivetrain feels stronger overall than the UX 200’s gas-only powertrain, which is rated at 169 hp.\n\nLexus did a good job tuning the UX 250h’s suspension. The ride is comfortable over uneven pavement, and the suspension’s responses are controlled and refined, but with enough damping to avoid undue harshness. Despite the suspension’s comfort orientation, it manages to keep body roll in check. F Sport versions have firmer suspension tuning, and when we tested that setup in a UX 200, we thought the ride was choppy.\n\nThe UX 250h has light-effort steering and not much steering feedback, though switching to Sport mode adds some heft to the steering wheel. The brake pedal, meanwhile, has a spongy but predictable feel, without any abruptness as the system balances the regenerative and friction brakes. \n\nThe Interior \n\nThe UX 250h’s diminutive size is apparent from the driver’s seat; the roofline is low, and I had just a half-inch or so of headroom to spare (I’m 6-foot-1). Over-left-shoulder views are almost completely obstructed by the large roof pillar next to the driver’s seat. Rear visibility isn’t great, either, which makes the standard backup camera even more valuable. \n\nComfortable front bucket seats are finished in simulated leather upholstery and have substantial side bolsters that help keep you in place in quick corners. They’re heated and ventilated in Luxury trims.\n\nThe UX’s backseat is more accommodating than you might guess; it’s reasonably comfortable for taller adults, if a bit short on legroom. The small rear doors, however, make getting out of the rear seat an ungraceful exercise. \n\nThe UX 250h’s cargo area is even smaller than I expected. The combination of a high cargo floor and low roofline result in a small space, measuring 17.1 cubic feet. The standard 60/40-split rear seat folds flat for more cargo space. \n\nMultimedia Usability \n\nLexus’ multimedia interface changes from vehicle to vehicle, and the UX 250h’s system incorporates some smart usability features along with some frustrating ones. \n\nThe console-mounted Remote Touch trackpad is one of the frustrating ones. It works like a laptop trackpad, controlling a pointer on the UX’s dashboard screen. The interface isn’t new, but it’s still not easy to use; navigating menus using a freeform pointer in a moving vehicle requires a lot of attention — attention better spent on the road and what’s ahead of you.\n\n2020 Lexus UX 250h | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nOn the plus side, Lexus’ integration of volume and tuning thumbwheels on the front center armrest is a smart usability move. The controls are easy to use, located where a driver’s right hand naturally falls.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are standard — the latter being a new feature for the 2020 model year. Both interfaces are optimized for touchscreens, but the UX’s display isn’t a touchscreen; you have to use the console trackpad instead. My test vehicle had an available 10.3-inch display in place of the standard 7-inch one, and its screen clarity was good. With that setup, CarPlay uses the full width of the widescreen display. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Lexus UX 200 First Drive: Missing a Solid User Experience\nThe 2019 Lexus UX Is a Clash of Good and Bad\nSpecs Comparison: Lexus UX 250h vs. Audi Q3 vs. BMW X1 vs. Volvo XC40 \nResearch Compact SUVs\nShop for a 2020 Lexus UX 250h\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\n\nThe Lexus UX earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating, good, in all crashworthiness tests (based on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal or poor), and its standard automatic emergency braking system received a rating of superior (on a scale of superior, advanced or basic). IIHS also tested the UX’s standard bi-LED headlights and optional triple-beam LED headlights; the standard headlights were rated poor and the optional ones rated good. \n\nOther standard active-safety and driver-assistance features include lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high-beam headlights, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability and lane-centering steering. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is optional. \n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe combination of a comparatively low starting price and impressive estimated gas mileage helps the UX 250h on the value front. Good driving manners are another plus. That said, the UX’s multimedia interface still needs some work, and one of the typical subcompact SUV trade-offs, limited cargo space, is especially apparent in this model. If you regularly carry people and cargo, a small luxury SUV like the BMW X1 would be a better bet. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The Toyota luxury brand calls the UX, debuting at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show, the “first-ever” Lexus compact luxury crossover.\n\nThe Lexus NX is a bit larger than the new UX; its wheelbase is slightly longer, but overall it is longer by about 5 inches, and that vehicle is already pretty small inside (especially in the backseat). The UX will be offered in two varieties: the gas UX 200 and a hybrid, the UX 250h. Its on-sale date is December 2018.\n\nExterior\n\nLexus’ most recent car designs have invoked conflict, with sharp angles and creases running up and down the surfaces of its vehicles. The UX continues this aesthetic: It’s all angles and ridges from the prominent front grille to the dramatic lines that run from the front fender rearward.\n\nThe UX also appears to be a mishmash of different styling elements from other Lexus vehicles. It has the grille of an RX, the three-element headlights from the LC coupe, and the NX’s overall shape and aesthetic, with the black-plastic cladding that runs along the bottom of the vehicle.\n\nLexus will offer an F Sport version of the UX, which will be available on both the gas and hybrid versions of the vehicle. It adds a mesh version of the front spindle grille, an exclusive rear bumper, 18-inch alloy wheels, and jet-black trim on the front and rear moldings. F Sport models also receive interior and performance updates, which we’ll cover later.\n\nInterior\n\nStyling is more distinct on the interior of the UX, which features a dash that is slightly canted in the direction of the driver and a widescreen display perched atop it. Lexus appears to have adopted an “if it’s broke, don’t fix it” approach to its multimedia system, so the touchpad-centric design remains, with the touchpad affixed to the right of the gear shifter.\n\nThere are a few different types of leather available, including one upholstery that’s inspired by sashiko, a customary Japanese quilting technique. You can even get the leather grain finish from Lexus LC and LS vehicles in the UX, which is a surprise — those cars are a significant cost increase over where the UX will likely reside.\n\nF Sport models add sport seats, a sport steering wheel, an 8-inch TFT display in the instrument panel and aluminum pedals.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThough there will be two available UX models, the UX 200 and the UX 250h, both will share the same engine: a 168-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission. The hybrid model features a “new-generation” hybrid system that adds a nickel-metal-hydride battery park and an electric motor that bumps up output slightly to 176 hp. Fuel-economy ratings are not yet available for either powertrain.\n\nThe UX 200 will be available as front-wheel drive only. Standard all-wheel drive for the hybrid models, meanwhile, adds an additional electric motor to the rear axle, which helps to shift power distribution to the rear wheels in certain situations.\n\nThe UX is also notable for being the first Lexus to use the new GA-C (Global Architecture — Compact) platform. Lexus says this platform offers a super-rigid structure and gives the UX the lowest center of gravity in its class, which should help to augment the UX’s performance and dynamics.\n\nF Sport models also offer their own set of performance enhancements, including different springs and stabilizer bars, as well as rear performance dampers. An adaptive variable suspension, which can change the damping force of the suspension on the fly, will be optional.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Lexus Safety System Plus will be available on the UX. This suite of safety technologies includes automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, road sign assist and automatic high beams.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lexus UX?\n\nThe Lexus UX is a five-seat subcompact luxury SUV now available exclusively in UX 250h gas-electric hybrid form; the gas-only UX 200 version has been discontinued. The UX 250h is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with electric motors and a 24-kilowatt-hour battery, for a total output of 181 horsepower. Previous UX 250h models came only with all-wheel drive, but front-wheel drive is also available now. All UXs use a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nCompetitors include the Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. The UX 250h offers 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lexus UX?\n\nIn addition to its powertrain changes, the UX gets a new touchscreen multimedia system with more up-to-date features than the old touchpad system, as well as a larger available 12.3-inch screen. Lexus says it has increased the UX’s body rigidity and made other improvements meant to enhance handling and quietness. New F Sport Design and Handling packages add black exterior accents, unique wheels and painted wheel-arch moldings. The F Sport Handling Package adds performance dampers and an active variable suspension, plus minor interior tweaks.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lexus UX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive LED headlights\nFoot-activated power liftgate\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lexus UX?\n\nThe UX’s standard safety features are a highlight, but this is a small SUV; getting five people inside will be a squeeze. The cargo area is small, too. The hybrid drivetrain delivers commendable gas mileage, but the UX’s acceleration is adequate at best. The luxurious cabin trim, however, is a highlight, and the new touchscreen infotainment system fixes one of the old UX’s most glaring faults.",

The UX 250h’s rivals include the Alfa Romeo Tonale, Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Volvo XC40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus UX?\n\nThe UX’s only notable change for 2024 is the availability of a power rear liftgate with an integrated kick sensor for hands-free operation. \n\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus UX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nVoice controls\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDigital key\nDual-zone climate control\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nAdaptive LED headlights\nFoot-activated power liftgate\n10-speaker stereo\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nRain-sensing wipers\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus UX?\n\nAs luxury subcompact SUVs go, the 2024 Lexus UX is a bargain thanks to its build quality, long list of standard features, great fuel economy and reasonable starting price. Its small, city-friendly size makes it perfect for squeezing into tight parking spots, but adults seated in the backseat are unlikely to be happy back there for long. Likewise, cargo space behind the split-folding rear seatbacks is limited.",
