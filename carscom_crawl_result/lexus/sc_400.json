      "expert_review": "OK, I admit it.\n\nThis job can be a lot of fun when you have an automobile as fine as the Lexus SC-400 to tool around in for a week or so.\n\nBut then, you probably surmised that.\n\nAt an as-tested price of $58,618, this ultimate driveway accessory is not exactly cheap. But it’s less expensive than therapy — something you probably wouldn’t be needing after getting behind the wheel.\n\nThis beautifully sculpted coupe de grace was originally shaped using plaster and balloons. It’s elegant yet strong, and looks particularly menacing in black.\n\nThe menace continues under the hood. The “entry-level” coupe, the SC-300, comes with a plenty powerful 3.0-liter six that pumps out 225 hp at 6,000 rpm and 210 pound-feet of torque at 4,800 rpm. For the live-fast, love-hard, die-young crowd, the SC-400, the model tested here, comes with an over-the-top 4.0-liter, four-cam, 32-valve V-8. This rather healthy power plant provides 260 hp at 5,300 rpm and 270 pound-feet of torque at 4,200 rpm. With the V-8, 60 mph comes up in 6.8 seconds (versus 7.3 for the six), and top speed is 149.\n\nSo, no matter what the numbers on the trunk lid say, you’ll be going somewhere fast.\n\nAutomatic transmissions come with either model; a five-speed manual is available only with the six. Press the pedal, and faster than you can say, “Yessir,” the scenery starts to blur.\n\nThe suspension handles all this power with equal finesse. It’s independent double wishbone, with gas shocks at each corner. Tires are 16-inch V-rated on the SC-400 and a full-size spare is included. The power steering is speed-sensitive, adjusting the power assist to how the car is moving. The result is sporty, precise handling but wrapped with an insulated feel. It’s sportier than the sedan and very luxurious.\n\nThe four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are huge and stop the car quickly.\n\nBeing that Lexus sprang from the fertile minds of Toyota, engineers have tried to address aparticularly aggravating aspect of living with a coupe: opening the door wide enough. The hinges on the doors of the SC-400 ar double-jointed, swinging the door out on both ends, making it easier to enter.\n\nOnce nestled in the comfortably firm buttery-soft leather seats, the steering wheel tilts and telescopes toward you automatically. (You didn’t actually expect it to just sit there, did you?) The gauges light up with an effect unequaled in other cars. Matte-finish maple — not the increasingly common gloss — accents the cabin.\n\nThe pampering continues with all the comfort and convenience features you’d expect. Nestled in this quiet cocoon, the optional 12-CD 280-watt Nakamichi sound system (complete with 10-inch subwoofer) will keep you entertained for hours. (It’s better than the sound systems of most homes I’ve been in.) The cabin is beautifully assembled, but the rear seat is best left as an upholstered package shelf, better to augment the small (9.3 cubic feet) trunk.\n\nBut practicality isn’t what coupe life is about. It’s about looking good and loving every minute of it.\n\nWhat price sanity? With Lexus, it starts at $52,400.\n\n1996 LEXUS SC400 Standard: 4.0-liter 4-cam, 32-valve V-8, four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission; speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering; gas shock absorbers; four-wheel power assisted anti-lock disc brakes; 225/55R16 V-rated tires; alloy wheels; dual airbags; dual remote electrochromatic mirrors with defoggers; electrochromatic rear-view mirror; intermittent wipers; automatic on/off headlights; theft deterrent system; maple trim; remote entry; power windows with auto down; power locks; retained power; power tilt telescoping steering wheel; power seats with memory; leather trim; automatic climate control; Lexus AM-FM cassette 170-watt audio system.

      "expert_review": "It seems everyone in America wants to become a truck driver, so you might wonder if anyone still buys luxury coupes.\n\nThankfully, there are enough drivers who don’t want to join the convoy and, instead of a boulder basher, opt for a modern piece of rolling sculpture.\n\nThe Lexus SC300 and SC400 coupes are such four-wheeled works of art.\n\nTheir styling has aged well, with a slightly rounded, straightforward look that still has a unique grace that doesn’t mimic Mercedes, as the less successfully styled LS sedans do.\n\nThese cars make their own statement.\n\nA small horizontal slit grille was added last year, which only differentiates it from previous models and adds little to its appeal. Out back, the taillamps have more detail. Again, this seems only to clutter up the original design, not enhance it.\n\nBut the promise of speed is still here, thanks to new engines and transmissions. The SC300 offers a 3-liter in-line 24-valve six-cylinder engine capable of 225 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nPop for the SC400 and you get a 290 horsepower V8 installed under the hood. This 32-valve engine and its smaller counterpart have continuously variable intake-valve timing to control power and fuel economy better. Keep in mind though, that fuel economy is a relative thing. The test vehicle — a well-optioned SC400 — measured 19.7 in mostly highway driving. The car requires premium fuel.\n\nBoth engines are fed through automatic transmissions. The five-speed manual has been removed as a choice from the SC300, which comes with a four-speed automatic, while the SC400 has a new five-speed automatic with a gated shifter to allow manual choice of gear.\n\nThe transmission shifts seamlessly and, hooked to the smooth V8, makes for a drive train with incredible amounts of power and refinement. The engine is silent at idle. A subdued growl emanates from the chrome-tipped dual exhausts when called for.\n\nThe five-speed transmission has three shift modes. Normal, power and snow. The snow mode is great for any kind of inclement weather.\n\nToyotas tend to have light rear ends, so it’s easy to make the tail slide around –sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. The snow mode helps keep things in check during all kinds of inclement weather. Of course, the handling wasn’t helped by the Goodyear tires on the test vehicle. They seemed to lose grip too easily, and wet weather traction was only average. Furthermore, when crossing expansion joints, they had a balloon-y feel and were particularly noisy, marring an otherwise quiet ride.\n\nThe normal mode seemed to keep the engine a gear above where you’d want it to be. The power mode always seemed to keep plenty of power on tap, whether you wanted it or not. This was the best position for most driving situations.\n\nPulling away from the pack is easy — the Lexus drive train attacks the pavement with the cool fury of a tsunami. Putting all that po wer to the pavement is a fully independent double-wishbone suspension with coil springs and gas-pressurized shock absorbers. This did a fairly good job of smothering bumps, but the ride is quite firm considering the silky fittings of the car. This seemed at odds with its otherwise smooth personality.\n\nThe brakes were quite good, although the pedal featured Toyota’s typical soft feel.\n\nFoiling thieves has been enhanced this year with Lexus’ installation of an engine immobilizer. The keyless entry buttons are integrated into the key, so there’s no separate fob to carry around.\n\nThe interior features most of the necessities of this class: automatic headlamps, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, automatic climate control, heated seats, integrated garage door opener, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, memory seats and, of course, leather trim and a killer sound system.\n\nThe wood trim has a more matte finish, one that’s more appropriate than the gloss used previ usly. There’s an indicator light to tell you when the car has turned on the headlamps, something some automakers don’t include with automatic headlamps.\n\nThe front seats were very comfortable, the leather and interior fittings were nicely made and the finish was excellent. The lone exception was the moon-roof cover, which felt flimsy.\n\nInterior space is snug, something coupe-lovers don’t mind. Others might find the limited storage space and lack of rear leg room appalling in 192-inch car. I don’t care — it’s a coupe. That said, there should be some provision made for loose change and a turnpike ticket, something the most mundane car has. Also lacking was a trunk cargo net. In a car with this much power and agility, it would be nice to have a net to prevent small items from sliding around the 9.3-cubic-foot trunk. Considering the $52,700 base price of the car, it’s ridiculous that it’s an option.\n\nBut this car is still a blast to drive, with a poise and agility that’s quite fun. At the same time, some may find it soulless in its perfection.\n\nWhatever your conclusion (I’ll go with the soulless crowd), it’s still more fun than a sport utility. All those nouveau trendy truck drivers don’t know what they’re missing.\n\n1998 Lexus SC400 Standard: 4-liter 32-valve V8, five-speed automatic transmission, front and rear stabilizer bars, variable assist power steering, four-wheel power disc brakes with anti-lock, 225/55R16 V-rated tires with aluminum alloy wheels, dual front air bags, intermittent wipers, auto on-off headlamps, electrochromatic inside/outside mirrors, theft deterrent system, maple interior trim, electroluminescent instrumentation, front power passenger seat walk-in, keyless entry, trip computer, power windows with driver’s side auto down, power door locks, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, power front seats, leather trim, memory seats, automatic climate control.

      "expert_review": "Lexus–whose luxury cars were born with a solid elegance that took Mercedes almost a century to achieve–broadens its American conquest with the SC400 coupe.\n\nThis time, Lexus won’t be clawing directly at the European competition. The SC400 is a category of one, creating its own niche in the two-door, high-performance, medium-priced luxury-touring car division.\n\nAnd with a base price of $37,500 for a near-flawless 2+2 of impeccable manners, it will be a warm winter in Stuttgart before anyone dethrones this car.\n\nBy concept and execution, the V8-powered SC400 presents stunning contradictions to industry norms:\n\n* Manufacturers traditionally charge a little extra for silkier and sportier two-ear versions of their four-door sedans. Lexus sells the SC400 for $1,500 less than the $39,000 LS400 sedan.\n\n* Most coupes are exercises in cosmetic surgery, little more than sedans with sheet metal lightly rearranged to carry two doors. The SC400, however, is a total redesign of its heavier, longer, taller and beamier big sister. The only commonalities are its 240-horsepower engine, four-speed automatic transmission and the Lexus logo, with its overriding implication that you are one smart buyer.\n\n* Coupes invariably utilize hand-me-down technology. The SC has been allowed to play pioneer of Lexus’ 400 series with a radical, 4-link hinge that moves the doors outand then several inches forward to provide greater room in closer quarters. Then there’s the passenger seat. Unlatch the back and the whole automatically slides fully forward to allow rear seat access without awkward glimpses of bare skin or underthings.\n\n* Finally, builders of $37,500 cars are usually quite content to take their shots and their lumps against other $37,500 cars. Lexus prefers to set itself up as a bigger underdog than the Houston Astros. In sophistication, quality of materials, craftsmanship and performance, the SC400 easily rubs fenders with European nobility: The Mercedes 300CE (at $57,000), the Jaguar XJS ($48,000) and the mighty BMW 850i (at an almighty $80,000).\n\nWould you prefer to cruise Melrose and arrive at Patina in an SC400 or the BMW 850i? The Bimmer, of course, with all its classicism. But would you spend $80,000 for an 850i when you could get two SC400s for the same price? Of course not. Especially when buying twin Lexii would leave sufficient bucks for seared whitefish and a bottle of Veuve Cliquot at Patina. With creme brulee for afters.\n\nOne word to the wise but sadistic: If you know a BMW 850i owner and don’t value the relationship, mention that the Lexus coupe is a fraction faster from zero to 60 m.p.h. With a top end of 150 m.p.h., it is only one frown slower.\n\nThe SC400–third car in the Lexus lineup now in its sophomore season–dispels an initial, lesser image of the marque. This coupe is not a nondescript motor car of passive whispers. It gives good engine sounds , has a purposeful heft and flexes more than enough muscle at all portions of its performance band.\n\nThe car growls and snorts politely because it was designed that way. We know through the zippy Miata, built for old bloods and their nostalgia, what music Japanese manufacturers can make by tuning an exhaust like a piccolo.\n\nThere is a slight cornering twitch to the SC400, almost a double-take between oversteer and understeer that says there is atiny touch of mischief in its genes. The result of all this careful calculation–and do not doubt for one moment that this car is one very savvy contrivance–is a powerful Japanese luxury car that finally has developed soul.\n\nThe SC400 will even salve whatever traces of guilt die-hard Middle Americans might feel about buying a Japanese car. For the concept of the SC400 was given style and dimensions through the clay models and car-size mock-ups of Dennis Campbell and Erwin Lui of Toyota’s Newport Beach studio, Calt Design Research.\n\nThat style, a marked dedication to ellipsoids and ovoids, is rapidly becoming a hallmark of auto design of the ’90s. Headlights are taking that form. Side elevations are showing the shape. The Mitsubishi 3000/Dodge Stealth has it. So does the Nissan 300ZX and this year’s Nissan NX sport coupe. And you saw it in the Dodge Viper supercar that paced and shepherded this year’s Indy 500.\n\nThe SC400, when viewed from above, looks like something best tied in pink ribbon for Easter. Yet it is a sensational figure given enormous continuity by oval headlights that fit curved and flush into a most businesslike front end.\n\nThe windshield is raked flat enough so that the long hood line seems uninterrupted as its rushes to the short, blunt rear deck with optional spoiler. Windows are narrow, sleek and discreetly emphasized by chromium frames.\n\nThe cast-alloy wheels, however, must have been picked out by Roy Rogers. The last time anybody used 10 spokes it was to mount a Gatling gun. These are the stagecoach wheels that ran backward during Saturday matinees.\n\nAbout the only flaw to be found in the SC400’s interior was one stitch on the center armrest that seemed a little out of line with the other 36,894. Elsewhere, driver and passengers look at a standard of supple glove-leather upholstery and liners; just enough bird’s-eye maple to ease environmental concerns, and that welcome wonder of daylight-illuminated instruments. The process is called “electroluminescence” and is worth remembering only if you play Scrabble with William F. Buckley.\n\nThe center console is from the Star Trek IX with big knobs, big lettering, big LED displays for climate control and radio–and enormous noises coming from the optional, 280-watt Nakamichi sound system (including a 12-disc CD player in the richly carpeted trunk) with its arsenal of precision amplifiers that deliver serious decibels to seven satellite speakers.\n\nUnder no circumstances consider the SC400 a four-passenger car. It has rear seats. Barely. They are better than token. But only just. They are upholstered and look functional. But so do saddles on a bicycle.\n\nOf course there is a driver’s side air bag. Anti-lock disc brakes also are standard. So is the automatic tilt and telescopic steering, power seats with memories (cannily linked to outside mirrors and steering wheel settings) for the driver’s side, automatic climate control, power windows with power-off operation. . . .\n\nWhisper it softly: This is about as good as it gets inside that aforementioned BMW 850i.\n\nPerformance from a 32-valve, 4.0-liter, aluminum V8 is huge. Initial acceleration projects the car ahead of anything except six-figure machinery at stoplights, and always with an intimidating growl.\n\nThe coupe’s mid-range power is made quicker still by the electronically controlled automatic transmission (Lexus has ordained that hand-foot pur ists will have to do without a five-speed manual) and almost imperceptible shifting. All of which makes high-speed freeway maneuvering a matter of seeing a space and then filling it.\n\nThe speed-assisted steering remains faithful in feel throughout the speed range despite a momentary heaviness when transitioning quickly from left to right. The brakes would stop a grizzly bear falling out of a tree. The suspension (ably assisted by Goodyear Eagles on those almost-beautiful, 16-inch wheels) is tighter than the LS400 and firm enough for driving by the seat of the pants without jarring any of their contents.\n\nAnd all this in a car that faces virtually no competition.\n\nExcept, possibly, for the Acura Legend coupe, which recently moved up-market and now sells for $36,000.\n\nAt that price–while offering less performance and prestige–the Acura Legend could easily lose 1991 sales to the Lexus SC400.\n\nIt could form a glimmer of hope for European and domest c car manufacturers. At least they will have Lexus ready to go one-on-one against Acura.\n\n1992 Lexus SC400/P>\n\nThe Good Fluid styling and a classic for the ’90s. Excellent pace, handling and technology. Competes with cars twice its price. Total breakaway from Bland X of Asian luxury cars.\n\nThe Bad Undersized rear seat.\n\nThe Ugly Worst wheels since the Goths outlawed chariot racing.\n\nCost Base: $37,500 As tested, $41,122(including power sunroof, spoiler, Nakamichi sound system, leather interior, anti-lock brakes, traction control, 12-disc CD player, etc.).\n\nEngine 4.0 liters, 32-valves, double overhead cam V8 developing 250 horsepower.\n\nType Rear drive, 2+2, high-performance luxury coupe.\n\nPerformance 0-60, as tested, 7.1 seconds. Top speed, estimated, 150 m.p.h. Fuel consumption, EPA city-highway, 18-23 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 3,640 pounds.",
