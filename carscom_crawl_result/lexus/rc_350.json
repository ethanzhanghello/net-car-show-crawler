      "expert_review": "Lexus’ first coupe since 2000, the 2015 RC 350 is an alluring new addition to the luxury coupe class. The best version is undoubtedly the base RC 350 with the F Sport option package.\n\nThe Lexus RC 350 reviewed here is the foundation for all RC variants; the top of the line is the RC F, which is reviewed separately. Don’t confuse the RC F with the F Sport Package, the latter of which can be added to the RC 350 to form something of a middle trim level. It has performance upgrades of its own, but shares the base 350’s V-6 engine. The RC F has a V-8.\n\nAt the base price, the RC 350 competes with the likes of the Audi A5, BMW 428i and Cadillac ATS 2.0T, but its standard 306-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is more aligned with the Audi S5 (333 hp), BMW 435i (300 hp) and ATS 3.6L (321 hp). Add the F Sport Package, and the RC 350’s price rivals that of the base 435i and ATS 3.6L. See the base models side by side here.\n\nLike BMW and Cadillac, Lexus offers its coupe with rear- or all-wheel drive. The Audi A5 and S5 are all-wheel-drive only. I drove a few different 350s, with both drivelines and a variety of options that change the car’s performance flavor.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLexus’ new styling direction is polarizing, but that’s not a bad thing. So long as there are two poles — people who like as well as dislike a design — the car can sometimes sell better than one that evokes no strong reaction in either direction. Those who are opposed to Lexus’ bold hourglass grille might be relieved to see the base RC 350’s nose is considerably more understated. The F Sport Package blows it out with an aggressive front end that’s almost indistinguishable from the RC F model. (Larger brake-cooling ducts in the front bumper are an RC F exclusive.)\n\nNineteen-inch wheels are also included, replacing the standard 18-inchers.\n\nHow It Drives\nRight away, astute drivers will recognize the RC’s rigid structure, which characteristically lends a feeling of quality and improved handling. Sometimes automakers call existing platforms new or decline to disclose their origin, especially for new models, but Lexus kindly explains that it borrowed architecture for the Lexus RC from the larger GS sedan, the compact IS sedan and also the IS C, the convertible version that characteristically has additional reinforcement.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 is a high point, providing stout acceleration, and the standard eight-speed automatic transmission makes the torque peak of 277 pounds-feet more effective than I expected at its relatively high 4,800 rpm. The car hits 60 mph in less than 6 seconds with rear-wheel drive and sounds mighty good in the process.\n\nThough the rear- and all-wheel-drive versions both offer F Sport, I drove an AWD 350 without the package. It definitely rode the most comfortably of the three cars, even though it was equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels. It did exhibit more body roll than the other versions, and the AWD pairs only with a six-speed automatic; having two fewer gears and more than 140 additional pounds, this is the least quick version, sacrificing a couple tenths of a second in the sprint to 60 mph.\n\nIt also loses an EPA-estimated 2 mpg on the highway and 1 mpg combined versus the rear-drive car’s 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/ combined estimate. The Lexus’ standard V-6 puts it behind automatic versions of the A5 (25 mpg combined), 428i (27 mpg) and base ATS (24 mpg).\n\nWith their upgraded engines, the competitors compare to the RC 350 in mileage. The S5 gets 21 mpg combined and the ATS 3.6L gets 22 mpg, but the 435i beats them all with an estimated 25 mpg combined. All the cars call for premium gas except the ATS 3.6L, which uses regular.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive RC felt reasonably sporty, due in part to the driveline’s 30/70 front/rear torque bias, which retains the balanced feel of rear-wheel drive. The six-speed behaved better than the eight, with minimal hesitation when jabbing the pedal to kick down to a lower gear.\n\nLexus cites shift times for the RC’s eight-speed that are admirably fast for a conventional torque-converter automatic (rather than a dual-clutch automatic like Audi and BMW use). It shifts quickly from one gear to the next — when it shifts — but occasionally hesitates too long before doing so when you jab the pedal in an automatic mode.\n\nFor this reason I thought the eight-speed was at its best during manual shifting and in its more aggressive automatic Drive Mode Select modes, like Sport S and (with F Sport) Sport S+. Decent automatic modes are a necessity with an eight-speed automatic, as having eight gears proves tedious when shifting manually. Sadly, a true, three-pedal manual transmission isn’t offered, as it is on some versions of the Audi, BMW and Cadillac.\n\nThe Lexus RC 350’s driving modes, which also include Eco and Normal, do a decent job of varying the throttle response, transmission shift points, power steering assist and — when fitted with the F Sport Package — ride firmness, courtesy of an adaptive suspension system that combines with the lower-profile tires for a considerably firmer ride than the base LexusRC 350’s, even in the softer setting. All the same, it’s still reasonably comfortable for a car of this type. (Ostensibly the top performer, the RC F sacrifices this feature, resulting in a ride we found unduly firm. It’s not just about firmness; adaptive suspensions read conditions and adjust automatically. Strange that it vanishes in the performance model.)\n\nOn the street, the Lexus RC 350 F Sport has a sporty feel even in normal driving — something many Lexus’ have lacked. Where the RC F has a squirrely rear end, the 350 F Sport’s chassis is up to the task of keeping the less-powerful car from sliding around too much. Note that the F Sport treatment changes the tires from all-seasons to summer tires. The latter are hazardous in winter driving, so even if you’re getting all-wheel drive with F Sport, plan to swap out for winter tires then switch back again to suit the season — or see if the dealer will work with you to buy all-seasons up front (they’re technically not a factory option with F Sport).\n\nIn addition to suspension changes, the F Sport version is eligible for an optional $1,900 steering upgrade in the form of Variable Gear Ratio Steering plus four-wheel steering. Available only with rear-wheel drive, this system adds both a few degrees of rear-wheel steering and variable front steering ratio. This isn’t a change in off-center steering responsiveness that comes from the way the teeth are laid out on the steering rack; that’s pretty common. With VGRS, turning the steering wheel the same amount can result in greater or lesser steering angle, depending on speed and the driving mode.\n\nFor a car with all this steering trickery, it got around a racetrack nicely. The ratio seemed appropriate at different speeds, and the rear-wheel steering seemed to let the car turn a sharper corner. I’d need more time in the car to be sure, but the steering feel with VGRS wasn’t bad. BMW had a similar system years ago and it proved terribly unpopular, mainly because it deadened steering feedback (at a time when the regular steering had better feedback than BMWs have now … ).\n\nFor handling, I still give the edge to the 4 Series and ATS. The A5 is less impressive in this regard, with numb steering.\n\nMy impression is mixed about the RC’s brakes because my experience varied, especially from my first drives (positive) to the cars we tested extensively later on (less so). I credit Lexus for legitimate upgrades, though: The front brake rotor diameters increase from 13.15 inches to 14.06 inches in the F Sport to 14.96 inches in the RC F. The RC F also has larger calipers. Initially, they all provided excellent linearity on both application and release and had good pedal feel. Later versions, though, were less linear and had a spongier pedal.\n\nInterior\nThe Lexus RC 350’s comfortable base seats are upholstered in imitation leather. This is the norm, but the Audi and Infiniti are notable exceptions. Real leather sometimes comes on higher trim levels, like the ATS 3.6L, but usually it’s optional, as it is in the RC 350’s Luxury Package — which costs almost $3,000. The F Sport Package brings sport seats (leather still optional) that are uncommonly comfortable for their type.\n\nF Sport also adds a powered tilt/telescoping perforated steering wheel, aluminum pedals and a nifty instrument panel with a single multifunction gauge that motors to the side to present a larger display when you press a button. Do you need this gimmick? No, but as motorized doohickies go, it seems to satisfy people.\n\nThe Lexus RC 350 has a luxury interior, complete with some interesting trim options — including one that looks like marble — and some bold interior color options, like Rioja Red. But we found fault, too, partly due to inconsistency among the materials. The upholstered gauge hood is nice, but there’s a lot of rubbery stuff on the dash, as well as on the window sills, where you’d prefer padding on which to rest your arm. To me, the gray plastic of the center console seemed like it belonged on a cheaper car.\n\nQuality is about feel, sound and interaction, too, and there’s no separating the car’s interior quality from the experience of its touchpad-based control system, which seems to be universally loathed (more details in the next section).\n\nDespite being an inch or so longer than the others externally, some of the Lexus RC 350’s interior dimensions are smaller. Most important, rear legroom is from 4.4 to 6.4 inches shy of the other cars. The Infiniti Q60 is closest, and it has 2.5 inches more. That car is also the only car with less backseat headroom than the RC 350, by fractions of an inch. The ATS has 0.3 inch more and the other main competitors have roughly an inch more.\n\nFortunately, coupe buyers are usually less interested in backseat use, and the RC 350’s front-seat headroom is on par with the S5’s. It trails the 4 Series by 0.8 inches and beats the ATS by 1.4 inches. The Lexus creams the others in front legroom by about 3 to 4 inches.\n\nThere’s one anomaly to note: In cars with the optional all-wheel drive, the front passenger’s footwell is crowded by a hump that’s incorporated to accommodate the additional drive hardware.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLexus will find no greater sympathizer than me for its Remote Touch Interface. Absent my preferred touch-screen, I like the idea of random access — the ability to move a pointer to an onscreen button or keyboard selection rather than scrolling through menus with a rotary knob, like the German brands require. When Lexus introduced its Remote Touch Interface, I was the only Cars.com editor who liked it (see the video tour). Unfortunately, it’s been redesigned twice since then and each time it’s been degraded. Now, equipped with a touchpad, it’s a huge turnoff to me and a confirmed deal-breaker for some shoppers. (The upcoming 2016 Lexus RX has a system that looks a lot like the original version, perhaps acknowledging the problems.)\n\nWe’ve found the touchpad interface even harder to use in a firm-riding car like the RC 350 F Sport (and especially the RC F). Lining up and activating, say, a zoom button on the map without instead clicking on the map itself proved nearly impossible.\n\nIf you want to skip RTI, you’ll have to live without the navigation system as well, which comes for as little as $1,530 in the optional Navigation System Package and is also included in more extensive packages.\n\nThe standard audio system includes an AM/FM/CD player, two USB ports, an analog aux-in jack, and Bluetooth wireless audio streaming and hands-free telephone support. The included satellite radio requires a subscription after 90 days. The optional Mark Levinson multichannel audio system more than triples amplifier power and almost doubles the speaker count.\n\nThe optional Enform App Suite adds internet radio stations including iHeartRadio, Pandora and Slacker, plus other apps that seem superfluous if you carry a smartphone: Bing, Yelp, Facebook Places, Movietickets.com, OpenTable, Stocks, Fuel Prices and Sports.\n\nWith a subscription for separate Enform functions — Lexus Enform Safety Connect with Enform Remote — owners can remotely start and unlock their RC using a smartphone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 10.4 cubic feet of volume, the Lexus RC 350’s trunk is near the bottom of the pack, along with the ATS. The A5 has 12.2 cubic feet, and the 428 cleans up with 15.7 cubic feet. The Q60 has a surprisingly snug 7.4 cubic feet.\n\nJust as important, the RC 350 has folding rear seats — a feature sacrificed in the RC F. The Audi, BMW and Caddy all have folding seats standard.\n\nSafety\nIn the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2015 Lexus RC coupe is a star, earning the top rating of good in all tests. Its optional collision warning and avoidance system is classified as advanced, one step below the top score of superior.\n\nWhere the institute categorizes the RC as a large luxury car, it classifies the BMW 3 Series as midsize. The 4 Series coupe shares frontal results with the sedan, which earned a disappointing rating of marginal (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front crash test. The coupe hasn’t been tested separately for side and other crashes. Its optional forward collision warning and avoidance system is rated advanced.\n\nThe new ATS hasn’t been tested yet, but IIHS rates its optional collision warning and avoidance system superior.\n\nThe RC 350 offers a backup camera only in navigation packages, but front and rear parking sensors come as a stand-alone option. Optional blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert comes alone or in packages.\n\nSee all the RC 350’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn its base form, the Lexus RC 350 is reasonably well equipped, with standard features such as LED headlights, keyless access with push-button start, heated side mirrors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and HomeLink universal remote control. All-wheel-drive versions add heated front seats standard.\n\nIts V-6 power is what helps justify a starting price roughly $2,000 to $5,000 above the base versions of the A5, 428i and ATS 2.0T. If you value that power, the RC 350 undercuts the S5, 438i and ATS 3.6L by comparable amounts. The F Sport Package version puts the Lexus RC 350 on the most equal ground with the latter group. If there’s a downside to the Lexus RC’s big base engine, it’s that buyers who care less about power don’t have a lower-cost option.\n\nConsidering the whole lineup, including the RC F, the RC 350 F Sport seems the best version, for its balance of performance, features and price.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2015 about the 2015 Lexus RC 350. Two additional engines have been introduced in the 2016 RC 200t and RC 300, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLexus’ first coupe since 2000, the 2015 RC 350 is an alluring new addition to the luxury coupe class. The best version is undoubtedly the base RC 350 with the F Sport option package.\n\nThe RC 350 reviewed here is the foundation for all RC variants; the top of the line is the RC F, which is reviewed separately. Don’t confuse the RC F with the F Sport Package, the latter of which can be added to the RC 350 to form something of a middle trim level. It has performance upgrades of its own, but shares the base 350’s V-6 engine. The RC F has a V-8.\n\nAt the base price, the RC 350 competes with the likes of the Audi A5, BMW 428i and Cadillac ATS 2.0T, but its standard 306-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is more aligned with the Audi S5 (333 hp), BMW 435i (300 hp) and ATS 3.6L (321 hp). Add the F Sport Package, and the RC 350’s price rivals that of the base 435i and ATS 3.6L. See the base models side by side here and the uplevel versions here.\n\nLike BMW and Cadillac, Lexus offers its coupe with rear- or all-wheel drive. The Audi A5 and S5 are all-wheel-drive only. I drove a few different 350s, with both drivelines and a variety of options that change the car’s performance flavor.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLexus’ new styling direction is polarizing, but that’s not a bad thing. So long as there are two poles — people who like as well as dislike a design — the car can sometimes sell better than one that evokes no strong reaction in either direction. Those who are opposed to Lexus’ bold hourglass grille might be relieved to see the base RC 350’s nose is considerably more understated. The F Sport Package blows it out with an aggressive front end that’s almost indistinguishable from the RC F model. (Larger brake-cooling ducts in the front bumper are an RC F exclusive.)\n\nNineteen-inch wheels are also included, replacing the standard 18-inchers.\n\nHow It Drives\nRight away, astute drivers will recognize the RC’s rigid structure, which characteristically lends a feeling of quality and improved handling. Sometimes automakers call existing platforms new or decline to disclose their origin, especially for new models, but Lexus kindly explains that it borrowed architecture for the RC from the larger GS sedan, the compact IS sedan and also the IS C, the convertible version that characteristically has additional reinforcement.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 is a high point, providing stout acceleration, and the standard eight-speed automatic transmission makes the torque peak of 277 pounds-feet more effective than I expected at its relatively high 4,800 rpm. The car hits 60 mph in less than 6 seconds with rear-wheel drive and sounds mighty good in the process.\n\nThough the rear- and all-wheel-drive versions both offer F Sport, I drove an all-wheel-drive 350 without the package. It definitely rode the most comfortably of the three cars, even though it was equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels. It did exhibit more body roll than the other versions, and the all-wheel drive pairs only with a six-speed automatic; having two fewer gears and more than 140 additional pounds, this is the least quick version, sacrificing a couple tenths of a second in the sprint to 60 mph.\n\nIt also loses an EPA-estimated 2 mpg on the highway and 1 mpg combined versus the rear-drive car’s 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/ combined estimate. The Lexus’ standard V-6 puts it behind automatic versions of the A5 (25 mpg combined), 428i (27 mpg) and base ATS (24 mpg).\n\nWith their upgraded engines, the competitors compare to the RC 350 in mileage. The S5 gets 21 mpg combined and the ATS 3.6L gets 22 mpg, but the 435i beats them all with an estimated 25 mpg combined. All the cars call for premium gas except the ATS 3.6L, which uses regular.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive RC felt reasonably sporty, due in part to the driveline’s 30/70 front/rear torque bias, which retains the balanced feel of rear-wheel drive. The six-speed behaved better than the eight, with minimal hesitation when jabbing the pedal to kick down to a lower gear.\n\nLexus cites shift times for the RC’s eight-speed that are admirably fast for a conventional torque-converter automatic (rather than a dual-clutch automatic like Audi and BMW use). It shifts quickly from one gear to the next — when it shifts — but occasionally hesitates too long before doing so when you jab the pedal in an automatic mode.\n\nFor this reason I thought the eight-speed was at its best during manual shifting and in its more aggressive automatic Drive Mode Select modes, like Sport S and (with F Sport) Sport S+. Decent automatic modes are a necessity with an eight-speed automatic, as having eight gears proves tedious when shifting manually. Sadly, a true, three-pedal manual transmission isn’t offered, as it is on some versions of the Audi, BMW and Cadillac.\n\nThe RC 350’s driving modes, which also include Eco and Normal, do a decent job of varying the throttle response, transmission shift points, power steering assist and — when fitted with the F Sport Package — ride firmness, courtesy of an adaptive suspension system that combines with the lower-profile tires for a considerably firmer ride than the base RC 350’s, even in the softer setting. All the same, it’s still reasonably comfortable for a car of this type. (Ostensibly the top performer, the RC F sacrifices this feature, resulting in a ride we found unduly firm. It’s not just about firmness; adaptive suspensions read conditions and adjust automatically. Strange that it vanishes in the performance model.)\n\nOn the street, the RC 350 F Sport has a sporty feel even in normal driving — something many Lexuses have lacked. Where the RC F has a squirrely rear end, the 350 F Sport’s chassis is up to the task of keeping the less-powerful car from sliding around too much. Note that the F Sport treatment changes the tires from all-seasons to summer tires. The latter are hazardous in winter driving, so even if you’re getting all-wheel drive with F Sport, plan to swap out for winter tires then switch back again to suit the season — or see if the dealer will work with you to buy all-seasons up front (they’re technically not a factory option with F Sport).\n\nIn addition to suspension changes, the F Sport version is eligible for an optional $1,900 steering upgrade in the form of Variable Gear Ratio Steering plus four-wheel steering. Available only with rear-wheel drive, this system adds both a few degrees of rear-wheel steering and variable front steering ratio. This isn’t a change in off-center steering responsiveness that comes from the way the teeth are laid out on the steering rack; that’s pretty common. With VGRS, turning the steering wheel the same amount can result in greater or lesser steering angle, depending on speed and the driving mode.\n\nFor a car with all this steering trickery, it got around a racetrack nicely. The ratio seemed appropriate at different speeds, and the rear-wheel steering seemed to let the car turn a sharper corner. I’d need more time in the car to be sure, but the steering feel with VGRS wasn’t bad. BMW had a similar system years ago and it proved terribly unpopular, mainly because it deadened steering feedback (at a time when the regular steering had better feedback than BMWs have now … ).\n\nFor handling, I still give the edge to the 4 Series and ATS. The A5 is less impressive in this regard, with numb steering.\n\nMy impression is mixed about the RC’s brakes because my experience varied, especially from my first drives (positive) to the cars we tested extensively later on (less so). I credit Lexus for legitimate upgrades, though: The front brake rotor diameters increase from 13.15 inches to 14.06 inches in the F Sport to 14.96 inches in the RC F. The RC F also has larger calipers. Initially, they all provided excellent linearity on both application and release and had good pedal feel. Later versions, though, were less linear and had a spongier pedal.\n\nInterior\nThe RC 350’s comfortable base seats are upholstered in imitation leather. This is the norm, but the Audi and Infiniti are notable exceptions. Real leather sometimes comes on higher trim levels, like the ATS 3.6L, but usually it’s optional, as it is in the RC 350’s Luxury Package — which costs almost $3,000. The F Sport Package brings sport seats (leather still optional) that are uncommonly comfortable for their type.\n\nF Sport also adds a powered tilt/telescoping perforated steering wheel, aluminum pedals and a nifty instrument panel with a single multifunction gauge that motors to the side to present a larger display when you press a button. Do you need this gimmick? No, but as motorized doohickies go, it seems to satisfy people.\n\nThe RC 350 has a luxury interior, complete with some interesting trim options — including one that looks like marble — and some bold interior color options, like Rioja Red. But we found fault, too, partly due to inconsistency among the materials. The upholstered gauge hood is nice, but there’s a lot of rubbery stuff on the dash, as well as on the window sills, where you’d prefer padding on which to rest your arm. To me, the gray plastic of the center console seemed like it belonged on a cheaper car.\n\nQuality is about feel, sound and interaction, too, and there’s no separating the car’s interior quality from the experience of its touchpad-based control system, which seems to be universally loathed (more details in the next section).\n\nDespite being an inch or so longer than the others externally, some of the RC 350’s interior dimensions are smaller. Most important, rear legroom is from 4.4 to 6.4 inches shy of the other cars. The Infiniti Q60 is closest, and it has 2.5 inches more. That car is also the only car with less backseat headroom than the RC 350, by fractions of an inch. The ATS has 0.3 inch more and the other main competitors have roughly an inch more.\n\nFortunately, coupe buyers are usually less interested in backseat use, and the RC 350’s front-seat headroom is on par with the S5’s. It trails the 4 Series by 0.8 inches and beats the ATS by 1.4 inches. The Lexus creams the others in front legroom by about 3 to 4 inches.\n\nThere’s one anomaly to note: In cars with the optional all-wheel drive, the front passenger’s footwell is crowded by a hump that’s incorporated to accommodate the additional drive hardware.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLexus will find no greater sympathizer than me for its Remote Touch Interface. Absent my preferred touch-screen, I like the idea of random access — the ability to move a pointer to an onscreen button or keyboard selection rather than scrolling through menus with a rotary knob, like the German brands require. When Lexus introduced its Remote Touch Interface, I was the only Cars.com editor who liked it (see the video tour). Unfortunately, it’s been redesigned twice since then and each time it’s been degraded. Now, equipped with a touchpad, it’s a huge turnoff to me and a confirmed deal-breaker for some shoppers. (The upcoming 2016 Lexus RX has a system that looks a lot like the original version, perhaps acknowledging the problems.)\n\nWe’ve found the touchpad interface even harder to use in a firm-riding car like the RC 350 F Sport (and especially the RC F). Lining up and activating, say, a zoom button on the map without instead clicking on the map itself proved nearly impossible.\n\nIf you want to skip RTI, you’ll have to live without the navigation system as well, which comes for as little as $1,530 in the optional Navigation System Package and is also included in more extensive packages.\n\nThe standard audio system includes an AM/FM/CD player, two USB ports, an analog aux-in jack, and Bluetooth wireless audio streaming and hands-free telephone support. The included satellite radio requires a subscription after 90 days. The optional Mark Levinson multichannel audio system more than triples amplifier power and almost doubles the speaker count.\n\nThe optional Enform App Suite adds internet radio stations including iHeartRadio, Pandora and Slacker, plus other apps that seem superfluous if you carry a smartphone: Bing, Yelp, Facebook Places, Movietickets.com, OpenTable, Stocks, Fuel Prices and Sports.\n\nWith a subscription for separate Enform functions — Lexus Enform Safety Connect with Enform Remote — owners can remotely start and unlock their RC using a smartphone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 10.4 cubic feet of volume, the RC 350’s trunk is near the bottom of the pack, along with the ATS. The A5 has 12.2 cubic feet, and the 428 cleans up with 15.7 cubic feet. The Q60 has a surprisingly snug 7.4 cubic feet.\n\nJust as important, the RC 350 has folding rear seats — a feature sacrificed in the RC F. The Audi, BMW and Caddy all have folding seats standard.\n\nSafety\nIn the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2015 Lexus RC coupe is a star, earning the top rating of good in all tests. Its optional collision warning and avoidance system is classified as advanced, one step below the top score of superior.\n\nWhere the institute categorizes the RC as a large luxury car, it classifies the BMW 3 Series as midsize. The 4 Series coupe shares frontal results with the sedan, which earned a disappointing rating of marginal (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front crash test. The coupe hasn’t been tested separately for side and other crashes. Its optional forward collision warning and avoidance system is rated advanced.\n\nThe new ATS hasn’t been tested yet, but IIHS rates its optional collision warning and avoidance system superior.\n\nThe RC 350 offers a backup camera only in navigation packages, but front and rear parking sensors come as a stand-alone option. Optional blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert comes alone or in packages.\n\nSee all the RC 350’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn its base form, the RC 350 is reasonably well equipped, with standard features such as LED headlights, keyless access with push-button start, heated side mirrors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and HomeLink universal remote control. All-wheel-drive versions add heated front seats standard.\n\nIts V-6 power is what helps justify a starting price roughly $2,000 to $5,000 above the base versions of the A5, 428i and ATS 2.0T. If you value that power, the RC 350 undercuts the S5, 438i and ATS 3.6L by comparable amounts. The F Sport Package version puts the RC 350 on the most equal ground with the latter group. If there’s a downside to the RC’s big base engine, it’s that buyers who care less about power don’t have a lower-cost option.\n\nConsidering the whole lineup, including the RC F, the RC 350 F Sport seems the best version, for its balance of performance, features and price.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2017 Lexus RC 350 doesn’t look any less extreme now than it did when the radically styled coupe went on sale a few years ago. It’s been kept fresh and competitive over the years with new engine and feature updates, of which I’ve sampled almost every version. The latest RC 350 to roll through the Cars.com offices for review is perhaps my favorite, though, because of several options it didn’t have.\n\nAt $48,289 as-tested, this Lexus RC was one of the more affordable Lexus coupes we’ve driven. It was likable not just because of its affordability, but also because it didn’t have the optional navigation system, with its goofy Lexus Remote Touchpad, or the ride-quality-ruining F Sport Package. Read our review of the 2016 here; it’s not all that different from the 2017, apart from how it was equipped.\n\nThe Lexus RC 350 is one of four coupe versions of the RC and the most powerful of the three more-modest ones in that group (the no-excuses, V-8-powered RC F tops the range). Specifications are listed separately for the RC 200t and the RC 300. Compare all four of them side by side here.\n\nGet the Base Multimedia System\n\nLexus’ Remote Touchpad interface replaces the RC’s typical multimedia system dial controller (as well as the mouselike device found on most other Lexus models). Like a laptop mousepad, you swipe with your fingertips to move a cursor on the main multimedia system for audio, navigation and phone control. Most Lexus RCs I’ve tested have this, and it isn’t particularly easy to use while driving. It’s easy to trigger the touchpad even when you don’t want to, and swipes don’t always result in the desired cursor movement.\n\nTest cars are usually loaded with options, so I was surprised (more like thrilled) to see the base multimedia system and standard dial controller. You simply rotate it from Radio to Display to Setup, etc., and your selection is just a click away rather than having to drag diagonally or think about where the icon is located using the touchpad system.\n\nIf you’ve ever used a dial controller like BMW’s iDrive or Mercedes-Benz’s Comand, the Lexus RC’s base multimedia system will feel familiar to you. Even if you haven’t, it’s easy to pick up. On the downside, the controller isn’t decorated in any unique way — it’s still the base system, after all — and the screen isn’t as high-resolution or filled with as many smartphone integration features as RCs with navigation.\n\nThe Lexus RC lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, my preferred phone integration system in new cars, but at least the standard infotainment system has new-for-2017 Scout GPS integration, where you download a navigation app that displays on the RC’s main media screen.\n\nThe Lexus RC isn’t very phone-friendly in another regard: My wife and I both have plus-sized iPhones in big cases, and there’s no open cubby to hold them. Both were too big to fit in the cupholders. The door pockets are hard to get at while seated, and for a passenger to access the center console is intrusive to the driver. For a nice drive with that special someone, you should either get smaller phones or leave them at home — the phone, not that special someone, though the latter would free up a spot for your phone in the passenger seat…\n\nDon’t Get the F Sport Package\n\nOK, maybe it’s not as simple as “Don’t do this,” but the F Sport Package groups a performance-oriented adaptive suspension with sport seats, a more aggressive Sport Plus driving mode and a slick instrument cluster. The F Sport amplifies the RC’s driving fun in corners, but I don’t think it’s as engaging as a BMW 4 Series M Sport, which better balances sport and comfort. The F Sport’s ride never feels relaxed, and the car is on edge even though the suspension’s firmness is adjustable.\n\nSo that leaves us with the base suspension, which is both perfectly livable and tight in a performance way without being overly twitchy or harsh. A non-F Sport is an everyday car that can take a trip into the city without rattling your fillings loose on pothole-ridden streets and still be comfortable for a weekend getaway.\n\nHowever, while the optional 19-inch wheels with Dunlop SP Sport Maxx summer tires certainly look good on the RC 350, tire noise plagued the interior. There were loud thwacks over bumps even when you couldn’t feel them in the seat of your pants.\n\nAcceleration\n\nIf you get into the Lexus RC 350 thinking it’s going to drive as full-throttle as it looks, you’ll need to lower your expectations a smidge. The RC 350’s 306-horsepower V-6 has a large task pushing the 3,700-pound coupe around, and this non-turbocharged V-6 compares closer to BMW and Audi’s turbo four-cylinder cars in performance (and price) than it does to their turbocharged six-cylinder counterparts.\n\nLexus says the rear-wheel-drive RC 350 can go from zero-to-60 mph in 5.8 seconds, which is a few ticks slower than both the BMW and the Audi. BMW estimates a time of 5.5 seconds for its turbocharged-four-cylinder 430i with an automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive, while an Audi A5 2.0T with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive is rated to get there in 5.6 seconds. Mercedes-Benz’s C300 coupe with rear-wheel drive hits 60 mph in a manufacturer-estimated 5.9 seconds. Compare the RC 350 with its competitors here.\n\nThe Lexus RC 350’s engine makes enjoyable whooshing, rush-of-air sounds, but you never feel a rush of acceleration — partly because the powertrain programming feels economy-minded. There are Eco, Normal and Sport modes, but Normal is more like an Eco mode with slow throttle response and transmission tuning that’s quick to upshift and slow to downshift. Slap it into Sport mode, and there’s only a small increase in throttle and transmission crispness; the car doesn’t transform into a different animal. But I think that’s OK for this car; it goes and it stops, and that will be plenty for most.\n\nWhere the RC 350 has 306 hp, the RC 200t has 241 hp and the RC 300 has 255 hp. The 200t is rear-drive only and the RC 300 is all-wheel-drive only. The RC 350 offers both, but its AWD comes with a six-speed automatic transmission instead of the eight-speed.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Lexus RC 350’s crashworthiness is top-rated in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests. A backup camera is standard. Optional safety features include blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and forward pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, the latter of which earned the middle rating of advanced in IIHS testing.\n\nIn the Market\n\nThe standout aspect of the RC 350 is how wild it looks compared with the modest designs of the BMW 4 Series and Audi A5. The Lexus RC 350’s starting MSRP of $43,985 with destination charge is comparable to the 2018 Audi A5 Coupe 2.0T ($43,775), 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe ($43,575) and 2018 BMW 430i ($43,395). My conservatively equipped test car, for $48,289, had a Premium Package ($1,240) that added heated and ventilated seats plus blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The car also added adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking for $500 and a moonroof for $1,100, plus a few miscellaneous features.\n\nIf styling is what floats your boat, the Lexus RC 350 is a perfectly competent package — even as a mid-range model, as my test car was. If you want something for curvy backroads or an occasional track day, you’d be barking up the wrong tree with the Lexus RC.\n\nAs equipped, it isn’t the most engaging car to drive. I don’t think that’s a problem, however, because the RC feels so roomy up front and has good visibility. This Lexus RC 350 offers a relaxed, airy experience perfectly suited for leisurely drives down a tree-lined backroad highway.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nThe 2020 Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Covered separately in the Cars.com Research section, the high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. \n\nRear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard convenience features include push-button start, dual-zone air conditioning, power-adjustable front seats and a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Options include a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, a power moonroof, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, the backseat is snug. We’re also not fans of Lexus’ touchpad-based multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four people and features four engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. RWD and AWD  versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The RWD RC uses an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus also sells the high-performance RWD RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. With the discontinuation of the Audi A5 coupe and convertible for 2025, the RC competes primarily with the BMW 4 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe bulk of the RC lineup sees no significant changes for 2025, the car’s swan-song year. The exception is the line-topping RC F, which now comes solely in a specially trimmed (and extra-pricey) Final Edition version with cosmetic upgrades that include BBS wheels and a carbon-fiber roof, plus luxury features such as heated and ventilated front seats and additional leather trim. The RC F Final Edition also gets a standard 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but — like a lot of coupes — its backseat is snug. And while the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sports coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. The RC’s core design is a decade old, and the market for two-door coupes of any stripe has waned considerably in recent years, making the RC’s discontinuation not too surprising. Even so, all versions of the RC have their charms; if you fancy this car’s blend of style, performance and luxury, you’ll want to act fast.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nThe 2019 Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats up to four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F is powered by a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8.\n\nRear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive versions have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Cadillac ATS.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nExterior changes include revised front and rear styling while the cabin gets some trim changes. Suspension and power-steering tuning has been updated, and the turbo four-cylinder's control unit has been reprogrammed for optimized response, according to Lexus. Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and Amazon Alexa integration are now standard.\n\nThe RC F gets a new limited-edition 10th Anniversary Special Edition that features matte-gray paint, blue Brembo brake calipers, black 19-inch forged BBS wheels, blue leather interior trim and blue carbon fiber accents. Only 240 will be available in the U.S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard convenience features include push-button start, dual-zone air conditioning, power-adjustable heated front seats and a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Options include a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a power moonroof, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo.\n\nStandard active safety features include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes the backseat is snug. We're also not fans of Lexus' touchpad-based multimedia interface. The high-output RC F provides some thrills but isn't as entertaining as you might expect for a top performance model.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series. \n\nLexus also sells the high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard. A new Black Line Special Edition based on the F Sport trim features triple-beam LED headlights, 19-inch black-chrome wheels, darkened exhaust tips, a black interior with silver-colored stitching, ash wood trim and a two-piece Zero Halliburton luggage set. Just 350 will be produced. \n\nRarer still is the new RC F Fuji Speedway Edition that’s limited to 60 units. It features Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a titanium exhaust system, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements and red leather-trimmed seats with Alcantara simulated-suede trim. A limited-production MSTR watch with design cues inspired by the car is also included.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPush-button start\nDual-zone air conditioning\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \nMark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, the backseat is snug. We’re also not fans of Lexus’ touchpad-based multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus RC lineup is receiving light updates for the 2023 model year, mostly regarding the cabin, in an attempt to help it stay competitive against rivals like the BMW 4 Series. The changes bump costs up $1,500 to start, and the luxury coupe now is priced from $45,470 (all pricing includes the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RC F Track Edition Quick Spin: Is the Ultimate RC Enough to Finally Find Love?\n\nThe interiors for the RC 300, RC 350 and line-topping RC F are largely carried over, but the infotainment system lineup has been shuffled around. All models get an 8-inch touchscreen standard, but an updated 10.3-inch touchscreen is also available. Trim on the glove box, instrument panel and side registers has also been revised, as well.\n\nThe RC’s exterior styling remains much the same, but for the RC 350, an available F Sport Special Appearance Package adds a two-tone exterior color combination, 19-inch Enkei dark-alloy wheels and a new paint color called Incognito. The RC F Track Edition will now also offer the Incognito color.\n\nPerformance hardware will once again include a trio of engine options. The base RC 300 comes with rear-wheel drive and is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while all-wheel-drive variants get a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. RC 350 models get a 311-hp version of the V-6, and RC F models retain the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 472 hp and comes with RWD only. RWD variants use an eight-speed automatic transmission; AWD models get a six-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Lexus RC and RC F are expected to arrive in dealerships early in 2023. Full pricing is below:\n\nRC 300: $45,470\nRC 300 AWD: $48,160\nRC 300 F Sport: $50,090\nRC 300 F Sport AWD: $52,380\nRC 350: $48,400\nRC 350 AWD: $50,565\nRC 350 F Sport: $53,020\nRC 350 F Sport AWD: $54,745\nRC F: $67,845\nRC F Track Edition: $100,720\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Lexus RC 300 F Sport Quick Spin: Less Than Meets the Eye\n2020 Lexus RC F and RC F Track Edition: Performance Pumped\nOur view: 2016 Lexus RC 350\nWhat’s the Best Lexus Performance Car?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four people, with four engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. RWD and AWD  versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The RWD RC uses an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus also sells the high-performance RWD RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nAside from a few new color options and available 19-inch Enkei wheels, the 2024 RC is unchanged from last model year’s car. It is, however, the last year Lexus will offer the RC F Track Edition, a pricey (six-figure) performance-oriented special edition that features a carbon-fiber hood, roof and rear wing, as well as Hitachi shock absorbers, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, and a unique black-and-blue synthetic suede interior.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\n Standard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation\n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, its backseat is snug. Competitors like the Audi A5 and S5 and the BMW 4 Series have fresher designs than the Lexus, and their more modern powertrains return better fuel economy. While the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sport-coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. Also, the Lexus Track Edition’s nearly $33,000 upcharge over the base RC F feels awfully steep for some carbon-fiber body panels.",
