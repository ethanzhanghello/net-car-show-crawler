      "expert_review": "The rise of the luxury sport-utility vehicle likely will be one of the biggest trends of the 1998 model year.\n\nEvery automaker that has brought out a rugged-looking but spiffed-up sport-utility vehicle has scored a solid hit this year, even if the thing can’t really go off-road very well.\n\nIn fact, this week’s test vehicle, the stylish new RX 300 from Lexus, is more of a pretender than a contender when it comes to kicking up some serious dust off road.\n\nBut that’s OK — because the RX 300 was not really made for that sort of driving. It’s what is called a hybrid vehicle. That is, the underpinnings are from a car, but the body is made to look like a sport-utility. The RX 300’s foundation is the Lexus ES 300/Toyota Camry, not one of Toyota’s trucks.\n\nThe RX 300 is really just a luxury station wagon that rides like a car. When ordered with the optional all-wheel drive system, the RX is capable of some light off-roading, not serious trailblazing. But for gadding about town on shopping excursions, the RX 300 is just the ticket.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nAs with the Toyota Camry, Avalon and ES 300 sedans, the RX 300 comes with the same smooth and powerful 3.0-liter, V-6, overhead cam engine and four-speed, electronic, automatic transmission. Horsepower is up slightly from either 194 or 200 in the cars to 220 in the RX 300.\n\nFor an additional $1,400, the RX 300 can be outfitted with full-time all-wheel drive. Our gorgeous dark green test vehicle didn’t have the system, but it really didn’t need it. In Central Florida, most drivers never need all-wheel drive. It would only come in handy infrequently, such as when launching a boat or when driving in very soft sand.\n\nGenerally, performance is excellent. No matter how hard you press the accelerator, the engine goes about the business of moving the RX 300 without making much noise or vibration. And the transmission’s shifts are practically seamless. A button on the shifter allows the driver to switch into a sport mode, which delays the shifts slightly and improves acceleration.\n\nA traction control system and a switch that enables the vehicle to start in second gear help keep the wheels from spinning on slippery pavement.\n\nBut the RX 300 does have a flaw that is very uncharacteristic of a Toyota-made vehicle: Several times I had to hold on tight to the steering wheel as I accelerated quickly.\n\nIt seems the RX 300 has what engineers call torque steer, which is a tugging to the left or right under hard acceleration. However, in most normal driving situations, the flaw is not evident.\n\nThe 3,700-pound vehicle feels light and agile as it builds up speed and rounds corners. For all practical purposes, it drives just like a Lexus sedan. The four-wheel, independent suspension system provides a quiet, supple ride that does not transmit much shock to the interior when driving over large bumps.\n\nThe power-assisted steering is light and responsive, making the RX 300 extremely easy to steer into tight spaces. Four-wheel, power-assisted, anti-lock disc brakes are standard.\n\nFuel mileage came in at about 19 mpg in combined city/highway driving.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOne reason Lexus has made such a big impact in the luxury segment of the market so fast is that its designers have a knack for creating first-class interiors.\n\nThe warm and cozy inside of the RX 300 is in keeping with the Lexus tradition.\n\nThere’s the usual backlit Lexus analog gauges but also a lighted screen in the center of the dash that displays the status of the air conditioning system and radio. The screen also displays trip information, and buttons just below the screen change the radio stations.\n\nThe shifter is not really on the floor. It’s angled slightly and comes out of the lower portion of the dash. I can’t recall another interior design quite like this.\n\nAs you would expect, the RX 300 is loaded with features and accessories. The air-conditioning system ha s rear vent s, and the power windows go up and down with just one touch of the button. The RX comes with remote-controlled power door locks, power heated outside mirrors, tilt wheel, cruise control and wood trim on the dash and door panels.\n\nThe power leather seats are superb. The driver’s seat has an inflatable lumbar support. The rear seats fold forward and turn the RX 300 into a good-sized cargo hauler. There’s a decent amount of head and leg room in the back for adult passengers.\n\nLexus didn’t skimp on safety. The RX has dual front and side air bags, daytime running lights, side-impact protection, anti-lock brakes and front and rear energy-absorbing crumple zones.\n\nOptions on our test vehicle included a power sunroof ($1,000), an in-dash, six-disc CD player ($1,050), and the leather trim package, which added $1,240. The sunroof, by the way, has a nasty flaw. Go faster than 45 mph and it makes a terrible roaring sound.\n\nIn the past, I’ve criticized Lexus vehicles for being bland and boring in styling and performance.\n\nI can’t say that about the RX 300. It has dynamite looks — I especially like the classy chrome grille and nifty looking taillights. The RX 300 is an excellent vehicle for those who like the image that an off-road vehicle projects but who would rather not drive a lightly disguised truck.\n\n1999 Lexus RX 300Base price: $31,550.Safety: Dual front and side air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection and traction control.Price as tested: $36,294.EPA rating: 19 mpg city/24 mpg highway.Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The RX 300 offers the velvety smooth performance of a Lexus sedan but in a tougher-looking, more versatile package. Well-equipped and assembled flawlessly, the RX 300 is an excellent value.",

      "expert_review": "Toyota spares no modesty when it describes the RX300 sport-utility vehicle sold by its luxury Lexus division.\n\n“The RX300 sets the direction for future sport-utility vehicles to follow . . . combining the SUV traits most customers want–four-wheel-drive traction for poor weather, commanding visibility and utility–with the luxury, safety and quality of a passenger car.”\n\nMighty big boast in an industry not known for little boasts. But Toyota has backed up its words. The RX300 is the benchmark for others to copy–and improve upon.\n\nThe RX300 is what’s meant by a hybrid, a vehicle that combines the best traits of car and SUV with a little mini-van cargo capacity thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe RX300 is what all the other automakers are chasing, and those who attended the Chicago Auto Show had ample evidence of that by the number of similar car/van/SUV concepts on display.\n\nIn fact, the Buick Rendezvous unveiled at the auto show not only combines the all-wheel-drive traits of a sport-ute with the luxury of a sedan from the RX300, it looks like it popped out of the same designer’s mold and stole its sheet metal.\n\nIf you doubt how popular hybrids have become or question how popular they will be, consider that the RX300 was introduced in the 1999 model year and immediately became the top-selling nameplate at Lexus.\n\nLexus can’t build ’em fast enough to meet demand. More than 73,000 RX300s were sold last year, making it more than coincidence that Buick plans to build about 70,000 Rendezvous hybrids for 2002.\n\nAnd if 73,000 people are willing to buy a $35,000 sport-ute carrying the Lexus name, how many would purchase a slightly less luxurious but equally functional vehicle that bore the Toyota name and was priced at about $30,000 or less?\n\nThe answer to that will come about a year from now, when Toyota gets a rendition of the RX300 that reportedly will be called Highlander. It will be unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show in January.\n\nRather dramatic success for an SUV hybrid derived from the Toyota Camry sedan platform. Little wonder Buick will have the Rendezvous ready for market a year from now as a 2002 model to try to take advantage of the demand for hybrids. If that’s the type of vehicle people want, and 73,000 have clearly said so, better give it to them.\n\nAfter the unveiling of the Rendezvous, we grabbed a Lexus to determine what it is that has folks standing in line and how it differs from the soon-to-arrive Buick.\n\nThe RX300 comes in front-wheel-drive or full-time AWD versions. Traction control is optional for those purchasing the FWD version. We tested the AWD 2000 model, the version of choice for those in the Snow Belt.\n\nThe hybrid is a more genteel sport-ute, a more stylish mini-van, a more spacious car, a less cumbersome truck. The RX300 defines not only hybrid, but multipurpose as well.\n\nRendezvous also will offer FWD with optional traction control or full-time AWD, a system called Versatrak that Buick says allows for packaging the AWD hardware underneath while still providing the room needed for a third seat that folds flat without having to be removed for added cargo room. The RX300 offers no third seat.\n\nRendezvous, by the w ay, offers safety belts for third-seat occupants, but the belts are in a bulging compartment in the roof. Good idea, unsightly execution.\n\nEven with AWD the step-in/step-out height is low enough so you can slip in–in slacks or skirt–without needing an assist in RX300 or Rendezvous, which we had the chance to examine, but not drive.\n\nThe RX300 looks smaller on the outside than it is on the inside where leg, arm and especially head room are most spacious. Ditto Rendezvous.\n\nThe RX300 is built on a 103.1-inch wheelbase and is 180.1 inches long overall, dimensions that come from its Camry heritage. Rendezvous is built on a 112-inch wheelbase and is 186.6 inches long overall, a larger vehicle built off the same platform as General Motors mini-vans.\n\nThe RX300 is powered by a 3-liter, 220-horsepower, 24-valve V-6 with 4-speed automatic.\n\nThe V-6 is peppy enough to move you from the line without pausing for breath, but don’t expect to leap from the line the same as you would if the 220-h.p. engine was powering a smaller, lighter Camry than this sedan/SUV hybrid.\n\nThe Rendezvous will be powered by a 3.4-liter, 185-h.p. V-6 with 4-speed automatic. While Rendezvous won’t go on sale for almost a year, Buick said another engine is possible in the future, obviously something with more than 185 h.p.\n\nThe mileage rating for the RX300 with FWD is 19 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway, and with AWD is 18 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g. highway. Rendezvous is rated at 19 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway with FWD, 17/22 with AWD. A standoff with FWD, advantage to RX300 with AWD.\n\nWhere the RX300 needs improvement is in handling. The suspension is tuned for a pleasant, sit-back-and-relax ride at the expense of precise, go-where-you-point-it-quickly handling.\n\nYou sit a little higher in an RX300 than you do in a sedan, which means a slightly raised center of gravity that you will feel in sharp corners and turns.\n\nBest to ease off the gas on those turns. Even so, whether a sharp or normal turn, you’ll experience body lean. Perhaps wider tracking if not a longer wheelbase and retuned suspension would give the RX300 better handling and stability.\n\nWhile offering AWD, the RX300 is meant more to haul the family through the snow on the highways than it is to venture off-road. With the RX300, off-road means pulling onto the shoulder to reach the mail box.\n\nBuick says it will focus on reducing unnecessary vehicle motion by offering a firmer ride, more sure-footed handling and more alert steering response from Rendezvous. Only time will tell.\n\nIts 9-inch longer wheelbase should help, as should a choice of ride or handling tires, as well as the fact the RX300 has been around long enough for Buick to put it under a microscope to nitpick its shortcomings and upgrade those systems for its own vehicle.\n\nNoteworthy items in the RX300 include dual front and side-impact air bags (Rendezvo us too), standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes (Rendezvous too), a multilevel center console with lots of storage, as well as a tray to hide a purse (compartment to hide a purse in Rendezvous in case you didn’t believe the line about the nitpicking), front and rear cupholders, big mirrors for more-than-adequate side and rear vision and first-aid and tool kits in the cargo hold, where golf clubs or luggage will fit easily.\n\nThe RX300 and Rendezvous have a hatchback lid. Don’t be surprised, however, if Rendezvous soon adds a two-piece lid, the top a regular hatch, the bottom a tailgate that folds down like on a pickup to hold heavy items while loading or unloading.\n\nThat feature was prominent in many of its concept vehicles at the auto show.\n\nRendezvous also will offer a feature the RX300 doesn’t for now: a park-assist system in which sensors detect objects behind you when backing up.\n\nAudible and visual warnings will alert the motorist of poten tial cont act with an object, from a child to a misplaced bike. Ford offers the same system in a variety of its vehicles, including the Windstar mini-van.\n\nBase price of the AWD RX300 we tested is $33,905. Buick insists Rendezvous will slip in under that.\n\nStandard equipment in the RX300 includes automatic climate control, AM/FM stereo with cassette, 10-way power driver’s/four-way power passenger’s seats, cruise control, tilt steering, power (one-touch) windows/door locks, tinted windows and rear privacy glass, power and heated dual outside mirrors, full-size spare, rear-window washer/wiper, carpeted floor mats, remote entry, ventilation/audio/trip computer/outside temperature display/clock controls and readings in an LCD screen in the dash and two power outlets.\n\nLots of standard equipment, but one gripe with the RX300 is the high cost of some of the popular options, especially $1,080 for an in-dash CD changer and $1,000 for a power moonroof.\n\n>> 2000 Lexus RX300 SUV Wheelbase: 103.1 inches Length: 180.1 inches Engine: 3-liter, 220-h.p., 24-valve V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Fuel economy: 18 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g. highway Base price: $33,905 Price as tested: $38,745.

      "expert_review": "You can’t credit the Lexus RX 300 with starting the luxury SUV movement since high-priced Range Rovers have been on the market for years and a few trucks-in-tux like Infiniti’s QX4 and Mercedes-Benz’s ML320 beat the RX to market.\n\nBut there’s no doubt that it was the 1999 RX 300, which went on sale in March 1998, that took luxury-brand sport-utilities from the country club to the soccer field, from polo matches to the Polo Ralph Lauren factory outlet, from Napa Valley to Silicon Valley.\n\nBut even Lexus wasn’t prepared for how popular the RX would become.\n\n“If you remember back to 1998 when the original RX 300 came out, people didn’t quite know what to make of it,” said Denny Clements, a Toyota group vice president and general manager of its Lexus Division.\n\nFive years ago, Clements was a Toyota district sales manager in Baltimore. He saw a version of the RX in a Toyota design studio in Japan at the time and, “I thought it was goofy.”\n\nLexus predicted it would sell 25,000 a year. It sold nearly 75,000 in 1999. That year, the RX 300 became the best-selling Lexus model. Luxury SUV sales zoomed from 90,000 in 1997 to 322,000 in 2002. By 2005, Lexus predicts, they’ll grow another 75 percent to 580,000.\n\nThe instant popularity of the RX 300 seems easy to fathom in retrospect. It offered comfortable seating for five, good cargo room, luxury amenities and an (almost) sedan-like ride — all in a sport-utility package. Plus, it came with a Lexus badge, had a fairly affordable price tag and, importantly, had a ride height that made getting in and out easy for women.\n\nNow, and this is where a lot of automakers stumble, Lexus has created the second-generation RX. How significant is the new RX? In the 15-year history of Lexus in the United States, only the original LS 400 sedan and the current LS 430 rank with the second-generation RX in importance, Clements said.\n\nPrices for the new model range from $35,025 for the two-wheel-drive version to $36,425 for the all-wheel-drive model. That first RX sold for $33,500 to $35,100.\n\nThe new truck gets a new, bigger engine, a 230-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6, which means that the 2004 RX will be called the 330. The five-speed automatic transmission is new, too.\n\nIt gets sharper exterior styling. Clements describes it as “much more athletic.” He didn’t say more masculine, but that’s the implication. It also gets improved fuel economy and a larger cabin, because the RX 330 is 6.1 inches longer, 1.1 inches wider and 0.4 inches taller than the RX 300.\n\nMost notable, however, might be the array of fancy and high-tech items that Lexus added to the RX. Most are options, but they extend features found in very expensive luxury models into a class of vehicles with price tags starting the mid-$30,000s.\n\nThe list includes:\n\nAir suspension.\n\nDrivers can choose from three ride heights, based on road condition s and terrain. The highest offers 8.3 inches of ground clearance. The lowest, called access mode, drops the RX to around six inches to make getting in and out easier. At speeds above 31 mph, the vehicle automatically moves to its normal ride height of 7.1 inches.\n\nAdaptive front lighting.\n\nRemember the Tucker, the car (and car maker) that fought Detroit and lost? Well, it had a center front headlight that turned with the steering wheel to improve night-time driving visibility. The RX 330 does Tucker one better. Available with the air-suspension system, the adaptive front lighting (AFS) system has two swiveling headlights. In a left turn, the left one rotates up to 15 degrees while the right one remains fixed. In a right turn, the right headlight moves up to five degrees.\n\nRear backup camera.\n\nOn vehicles equipped with the DVD-based navigation system, a rear backup camera helps assure drivers that no obstacles (like bikes or kids or trash cans) lurk behind the vehicle. When a driver shifts into reverse, the navigation system’s monitor instantly offers a glimpse of what’s behind. The camera is mounted near the rear license plate.\n\nRain-sensing wipers and water-repellent glass.\n\nThe wipers come on whenever rain hits the front windshield, while the front-door glass keeps rain from impeding a driver’s vision.\n\nWhat the new RX doesn’t have that some of its competition does are adjustable pedals, a specific roll-over prevention system like Volvo’s XC90 and a third row of seats.\n\nLexus has two other sport-utilities, the GX 470 and the LX 470, with three rows of seats, and because the first-generation RX was such a success without one, “we didn’t see the need,” Clements said.\n\nLexus feels it has added enough new stuff to appeal to its already loyal RX owner base. Fully 40 percent of RX 330 buyers will be current or previous RX 300 owners, Clements said.\n\nMost buyers will be women, though more men will buy the RX 330 than did the RX 300, he said. Nearly three-quarters of buyers will be married. Many will be 40 to 45 years old with household incomes of $125,000 to $150,000.\n\nSurprisingly, only 30 to 35 percent of them will have children under 18 at home.\n\n“They’re empty-nesters or they’re single,” Clements said.\n\nWhile Toyota will continue to build the RX at its Kyushu plant in Japan, production of the SUV will start in Ontario, Canada, in September, making it the first North American-made Lexus. Starting in 2005, Lexus will offer a hybrid version of RX 330 that promises increased power with compact-car fuel economy.\n\n“It is an amazing technology,” said Clements, who expressed a concern that it’ll be so good that “it will actually make the non-hybrid maybe even less attractive.”",
