      "expert_review": "A few months ago, Lexus announced a round of updates to its electric RZ SUV for the 2026 model year. Now that details on its Toyota (bZ — nee bZ4X — and bZ Woodland) and Subaru (Solterra and Trailseeker) cousins have dropped, Lexus has a few more bits of information to share on the refreshed RZ.\n\nRelated: Updated 2026 Lexus RZ Debuts With New 402-HP RZ 550e F Sport\n\nWe already knew the 2026 RZ would be more powerful than the 2025 model, with the front-wheel-drive version’s output growing from 201 horsepower to 221. Now, we also know that the base model will earn an alphanumeric promotion as a result; previously known as the RZ 300e, it now goes by RZ 350e. Oddly, the all-wheel-drive RZ 450e’s final total output lands at 308 hp, 30 less than its bZ and Solterra counterparts. Lexus says the RZ 300e should accelerate from 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds, with the RZ 450e needing 4.9 seconds. The 402-hp RZ 550e F Sport will get there in 4.1.\n\nBattery Specs and Range\n\nLexus has also confirmed that the RZ’s updated battery pack stores the same 74.7 kilowatt-hours of energy as the ones in its platform-mates. The brand has yet to announce final range ratings, though, saying only that the RZ 300e will be good for about 300 miles, while the RZ 450e will have a range of 260 miles. Another surprise is that the RZ 550e F Sport will get a slightly larger 77-kWh battery, which it will drain in about 225 miles.\n\nAs wheel size can have a significant impact on electric-vehicle range, those estimates are for the smallest available wheels. Eighteens are standard on the RZ 350e and RZ 450e, with 20-inch wheels available, and 20s are standard on the F Sport. A North American Charging Standard port will allow the 2026 RZ to juice up at Tesla charging stations, and a more powerful onboard charger means the electric SUV can replenish its pack from 10% to 80% in approximately 30 minutes.\n\nHow Big Is the 2026 Lexus RZ?\n\nIn the absence of complete specifications and dimensions for all of the vehicles in the updated EV family, the biggest question about the 2026 RZ might be which pair of vehicles it is most closely related to. The 2025 RZ is already a fair bit longer than the bZ4X and Solterra, and the 2026 model measures nearly the same 189.2 inches as the 2025 model. The 2026 bZ and 2025 Solterra both measure 184.6 inches long. Subaru has not released the dimensions of the Trailseeker, but Toyota says the Woodland — which appears to be nearly identical — is “nearly 6 inches” longer than the regular bZ, so at least 190 inches long.\n\nMore Interior Updates\n\nLexus is also taking this opportunity to upgrade the RZ’s interior. In addition to the previously announced steer-by-wire system (though minus the steering yoke), the 2026 model features an improved electrochromic panoramic glass roof. Better performance at both ends of its variable-opacity spectrum means it tints deeper when occupants want a shady interior and is clearer when they want to let the light in. A newly available synthetic suede door trim features laser-etched patterns that, in tandem with changing ambient lighting, create shadows that slowly change over the course of a long drive.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nAmidst these details, there is nothing new to report about the 2026 Lexus RZ’s arrival and pricing. Lexus is still saying only that it will go on sale later in 2025 and that pricing will be announced closer to launch.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Lexus RZ 450e Review: Delightful in (Almost) All the Right Places\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nToyota Joins Ionna Charging Network Joint Venture\nToyota Next Automaker to Get Tesla Supercharger Access\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nDebuting for 2023 as the first all-electric Lexus, the RZ is a luxury SUV that slots between the brand’s compact NX and mid-size RX SUVs in terms of size. The RZ shares a basic platform with the Toyota bZ4X and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The front-drive RZ 300e is new for 2024, and it has a single motor making 201 horsepower; it can go up to 266 miles on a full charge, per the EPA, although upgrading from the standard 18-inch wheels to the available 20-inch wheels drops that figure to just 224 miles. The AWD RZ 450e adds a second motor on the rear axle that bumps total output to 310 hp; it drops the driving range to 220 miles with the standard wheels and just 196 miles on the 20s. The RZ’s rivals include the Audi Q4 e-Tron, Cadillac Lyriq and Genesis GV60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nIn addition to the new front-drive RZ 300e model, which drops the RZ’s starting price by almost $5,000, a dual-voltage charging cable is now standard on all RZs. It enables charging on both 120- and 240-volt outlets.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Lexus RZ Have?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 196-266 miles depending on trim and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s charging times range from an estimated 9.5 hours on a standard 240V Level 2 charger to go to a 100% charge, down to an estimated 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger to go from a 10% charge to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus RZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nSynthetic leather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch wheels\nSynthetic suede upholstery\nHeated outboard rear seats\nFront-seat foot-and-leg radiant heater\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n13-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nLane change assist\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAutomated steering while parking\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus RZ?\n\nMost new electric vehicles introduced in the last few years have significantly greater range than the RZ — and some even double it. Its slow charging speed means you get the worst of both worlds: The battery drains quickly, and it takes a long time to recharge. For the money, there are plenty of choices with superior range. If you’re just looking for a daily-use EV for a commute and its short leash doesn’t bother you, the RZ is a luxurious and comfortable way to motor silently around.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nDebuting for 2023 as the first all-electric Lexus, the RZ is a luxury SUV that, in terms of size, slots between the brand’s compact NX and mid-size RX SUVs. The RZ shares a basic platform with the Toyota bZ4X and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The front-drive RZ 300e has a single motor making 201 horsepower; it can travel an EPA-rated 266 miles on a full charge, but upgrading from the standard 18-inch wheels to available 20-inch wheels drops that estimate to just 224 miles. The AWD RZ 450e adds a second motor on the rear axle that bumps total output to 310 hp; it drops the driving range to 220 miles with the standard wheels and just 196 miles with the 20s. The RZ’s rivals include the Audi Q4 e-Tron, Cadillac Lyriq and Optiq, and Genesis GV60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe RZ 300e and RZ 450e both add an entry-level trim for 2025 that slots below the existing Premium and Luxury trims; those new base models start $4,200 less than their Premium counterparts. Lexus has also lowered the prices of the Premium and Luxury by $7,000 this year. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Lexus RZ Have?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 196-266 miles depending on trim and wheel size. \n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nThe Lexus RZ’s charging times range from an estimated 9.5 hours on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger to go to a 100% charge, down to an estimated 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger to go from a 10% charge to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual-zone climate control\nSynthetic leather seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\n20-inch wheels\nSynthetic suede upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated outboard rear seats\nFront-seat foot-and-leg radiant heater\nDigital-camera rearview mirror\n13-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nLane departure steering assist\nFront cross-traffic alert\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomated steering while parking\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RZ?\n\nMost new electric vehicles introduced in the last few years have significantly greater range than the RZ (and some even double it). Its slow charging speed means you get the worst of both worlds: The battery drains quickly, and it takes a long time to recharge. For similar money, there are plenty of choices with superior range, but if you’re just looking for a daily-use EV for a commute and its short leash doesn’t bother you, the RZ is a luxurious and comfortable way to motor silently around — and substantial price cuts for 2025 make it that much more compelling.",
