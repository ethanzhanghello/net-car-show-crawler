      "expert_review": "The 2015 Lexus RC F coupe is a fun performance coupe that improves on the IS F sedan, but it falls behind competitors on a racetrack.\n\nThe discontinued IS F sedan, which was Lexus’ first attempt to take on performance cars from BMW, Cadillac and other luxury brands, was too squirrely, disjointed and awkward-looking.\n\nThe RC F is a high-performance version of Lexus’ new rear-wheel-drive coupe, the 2015 RC 350 — not to be confused with the mildly souped-up version that’s confusingly named the RC 350 F Sport. Based on price and specifications, the RC F compares to the BMW M4 (the renamed M3 Coupe) and the new 2016 Cadillac ATS-V. All three competed in our recent Luxury Performance Coupe Challenge, in which four editors and one consumer graded and ranked the cars in many categories. The Audi RS 5 is another alternative for performance-coupe shoppers. (Compare all four side-by-side here.)\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe RC F has Lexus’ boldest front end yet, characterized by the largest execution of what the company calls its spindle-shaped grille. I’d call it a distorted hourglass instead, as I suspect few Lexus shoppers do their own tailoring and/or are colonial historians.\n\nWhile the RC 350 F Sport looks darn close to the RC F, a larger front bumper vent in front of each wheel — for more effective brake cooling — gives away the top dog.\n\nThough Lexus’ new design movement is divisive, the RC F was pretty well received among passers-by, especially the one with a deep-blue Ultrasonic Blue Mica 2.0 paint job.\n\nAs an option, shoppers can opt for a Performance Package that adds a visible carbon fiber rear spoiler and carbon fiber roof. The roof removes weight up high, lowering the car’s center of gravity. Lexus kindly offers an optional glass moonroof as an alternative, which does the opposite.\n\nHow It Drives\nI view the RC F’s driving experience from a few perspectives: on its own merit, versus the IS F, and versus the BMW and Cadillac.\n\nIt’s most impressive when compared with the retired IS F sedan. Last sold as a 2014, the IS F marked the debut of Lexus’ F performance division, and I never liked driving it. It was squirrely, with an unruly rear end and countermeasures too clumsy to control it. The RC F brings things more in line without sacrificing the playful character of a tail that’s willing to slide out — and a stability system that allows it to do so without being overly limiting. (The M4’s stability system, even in a relaxed mode called MDM, is a complete buzzkill — a surprise to us all.)\n\nThe RC F is controllable, but there’s no doubt it’s more of a tail-wagger than the other two cars in our Challenge. It comes standard with a Torsen mechanical limited-slip differential, but our Challenge car had the optional Torque Vectoring Differential as part of the Performance Package. A TVD button on the center console controls it, providing Standard, Slalom and Track modes that vary how the electronically controlled clutch packs distribute torque left and right. When I drove this car on the Monticello Motor Club private racetrack in New York state, I thought it did a good job. After experimenting with it head-to-head against the BMW and Cadillac at the Autobahn Country Club track in Joliet, Ill., I was left wanting perhaps a fourth TVD setting that would glue the tail down and give it comparable road-holding.\n\nLexus cites shift times that are admirably fast for a conventional torque-converter automatic rather than a dual-clutch automatic like Audi and BMW use. The RC F’s eight-speed does shift quickly from one gear to the next — when it shifts — but it hesitates too long before doing so when you jab the pedal in an automatic mode. After an earlier drive where I noticed the hesitation only occasionally, our Challenge car exhibited it more — including a few times when shifting manually via the steering-wheel paddles.\n\nI thought the eight-speed was at its best on the track in the automatic Sport S+ mode. There, it did a good job of picking the right gear and continuously downshifting through the gears as you decelerate. My colleagues were less enthused in one regard, saying the downshifts were too abrupt and occasionally happened midcorner. I’ve come to view competent automatic modes as a necessity with an eight-speed automatic because — as I said of the first such automatic transmission on the market, on the IS F in 2008 — having eight gears proves tedious when shifting manually. Sadly, the Lexus doesn’t offer a proper three-pedal manual transmission like the other two models do.\n\nOur experience with an automatic ATS-V suggests it’s better than the others, but the Cadillac we drove in the Challenge was a manual. Our big surprise was the M4, whose automatic modes seldom found the right gear; we resorted to paddles on that one.\n\nOn the plus side for the M4, it provides the absolute best control over variable characteristics like throttle response, shift speed, power-steering assist, adaptive suspension and stability control. Why? Because the BMW lets the driver control each system independently, and to program one’s preferences into two umbrella modes accessible via buttons on the steering wheel. In the Caddy and Lexus, those modes are predetermined by the manufacturer. The RC F’s Eco, Normal, Sport+ and Sport S+ aren’t very compelling, partly because there’s no adaptive suspension for them to control.\n\nThe RC F tragically doesn’t offer an adaptive suspension even as an option (puzzling because one is available on the lesser RC 350 F Sport). As a standard feature, the ATS-V’s adaptive suspension gives it the best split personality in the test. One could easily say a likely buyer for these cars wouldn’t care too much about ride quality, but knowing a higher level of comfort is possible, as it is in the Caddy, raises the bar.\n\nThough the M4 we drove had an adaptive suspension — a $1,000 option — it failed to deliver a comfortable ride in Comfort mode. Its firmness compared to the RC F’s, but there’s no denying that a computer-controlled adaptive suspension that responds to surfaces and body motions is worth having, even if the firmness is the same as a fixed suspension’s.\n\nNote that during our Challenge we removed the RC F from road-course testing earlier than hoped after it blew bluish-white smoke out the tailpipes. It seemed fine afterward, without so much as a check engine light, so we suspect the high g-forces allowed some motor oil to get past the PCV valve into the intake manifold. Still, out of an abundance of caution, we retired it for the day. The other two cars exhibited no such problem.\n\nIn our drag-strip testing, the RC F did zero to 60 mph in 4.88 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.12 seconds at 109.11 mph. The ATS-V was quicker, hitting 60 mph in 4.32 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.41 at 115.62 mph. The winner was the M4, which made it to 60 mph in 3.97 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.05 at 118.35 mph.\n\nThese are all pretty close, but we grade on the driving experience, as well. Overall, the RC F is undeniably a performer, quicker and more capable than most vehicles on the road. Having eight speeds to work with, it’s reasonably quick off the line, but its torque deficit is indeed felt in the seat of your pants.\n\nWhile specifications aren’t a guarantee, the RC F’s predict the results above pretty well versus the BMW and Cadillac. Though it has the highest horsepower rating, at 467 hp versus the M4’s 425 and the ATS-V’s 464 hp, the Lexus’ torque rating is the lowest, at 389 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The M4 has 406 pounds-feet at a low 1,850 rpm, and the ATS-V has the most: 445 pounds-feet at 3,500 rpm. The Lexus is also the heaviest, at 3,958 pounds. That’s a significant 258 pounds more than the Cadillac and 373 pounds more than the M4 with an automatic transmission. (For those keeping score, the RS 5, which wasn’t provided for the Challenge, weighs the most, at 4,009 pounds, and has the lowest torque rating: 317 pounds-feet at 4,000 rpm.)\n\nWhat’s a bit disappointing is that there’s no apparent advantage to the RC F’s engine having two cylinders more than the other cars, except maybe better sound outside the car. The RC F employs a 5.0-liter V-8 where the BMW and Caddy have turbocharged V-6s. The days of anemic, low-rev turbocharged engines are over; in fact, it’s swung the other way. The RC’s normally aspirated V-8 (like the Audi’s and the one BMW abandoned when it engineered the current-generation M3 and M4) delivers the kind of modest off-the-line acceleration we once endured from small turbocharged engines, a tuning designed to save fuel.\n\nThe strategy works, sort of. In our mileage test, the Lexus achieved 24.26 mpg in combined driving, beating the BMW’s 23.46 mpg and the Cadillac’s 22.9 mpg (the latter with a six-speed manual). This suggests our drive loop skewed more toward highway driving, as the Lexus has an EPA highway rating of 25 mpg, where the M4 automatic is 24 mpg and the ATS-V manual is 23 mpg. In more balanced city/highway driving, the EPA predicts all three cars will get 19 mpg. (The RS 5 is rated 18 mpg combined.)\n\nIn our braking tests, the RC F took the longest, stopping from 60 mph to zero in 127.68 feet. The Caddy was best at 119.47 feet. The BMW required 122.85 feet — surprising because it had $8,150 optional brakes. Those carbon-ceramic designs are intended primarily to resist fade, though, which they did — lap after lap on the road course. Unfortunately, the RC F’s track time — and thus fade testing — was cut short by the cloud of smoke. In normal street braking, I thought the Lexus and Cadillac were only reasonably linear on application and less so on release. The BMW’s pedal was the best.\n\nInterior\nDespite the RC F being fractions of an inch longer than the others externally, some of its interior dimensions are smaller. Most important, rear legroom is about 6 inches shy of the other cars and shoulder room is 3 to 5 inches less. For internal space, the M4 is the clear leader. None of these cars’ backseats are very accommodating for adults, but the RC F is the least comfortable. Its most generous dimension is front-seat legroom, but our unlikely collection of 6-foot-plus editors and guest consumer had no complaints about the other cars’ in this regard.\n\nThe RC F certainly features luxury appointments, but we found fault with it, too, partly due to inconsistency among the materials. To me, the gray plastic of the center console seemed like it belonged on a cheaper car. Quality is about feel, sound and interaction, too, and there’s no separating the car’s interior quality from the experience of its touchpad-based control system, which seems to be universally loathed (more details in the next section).\n\nAmong the Cars.com judges, the RC F averaged 6 points (out of a possible 10) for interior quality, just behind the ATS-V’s 6.7 points. The Cadillac’s low rating was due in part to its similarly unpopular Cadillac User Experience control interface. Our test M4, as equipped, scored highest with 8 points; its once-reviled iDrive interface is now a relative high point.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLexus will find no greater sympathizer than me for its Remote Touch Interface. Absent my preferred touch-screen, I like the idea of random access — the ability to move a pointer to an onscreen button or keyboard selection rather than scrolling through menus with a rotary knob, like the German brands require. When Lexus introduced its Remote Touch Interface, I was the only Cars.com editor who liked it (see the video tour). Unfortunately, it’s been redesigned twice since then and each time it’s been degraded. Now, equipped with a touchpad, it’s a huge turnoff to me and a confirmed deal-breaker for some shoppers. (The upcoming 2016 Lexus RX has a system that looks a lot like the original version, which seems a clear recognition of both the problem and my brilliance. Well, maybe just the first part.)\n\nAs bad as the touchpad interface already is, when combined with the RC F’s bumpy ride it’s often unusable. Lining up and activating, say, a zoom button on the map without instead clicking on the map itself proved a near impossibility.\n\nIf you want to pass on RTI (bundled in either a $1,760 or $2,840 option package), you’ll also go without a navigation system, backup camera, internet radio stations including iHeartRadio, Pandora and Slacker, plus other apps in the Enform App Suite, such as Bing, Yelp, Facebook Places, Movietickets.com, OpenTable, Stocks, Fuel Prices and Sports. You’ll also sacrifice a second USB port.\n\nThe standard audio setup includes a 7-inch display, 10 speakers, satellite radio (subscription required after 90 days), an in-dash CD player and Bluetooth wireless audio streaming and hands-free telephone support. There’s also a single USB port and analog auxiliary jack.\n\nIn the Controls & Multimedia category, Cars.com judges awarded the BMW 7.7 points, the Caddy 5.0 points and the Lexus 3.7 points on average.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 10.1 cubic feet of volume, the RC F’s trunk was the smallest of the three Challenge cars, just behind the ATS-V’s 10.4 cubic feet. The M4 has 11.0 cubic feet. The RS 5 outdoes them all with 12.2 cubic feet.\n\nWhat’s disappointing about the Lexus is its lack of folding rear seats to extend the cargo area into the cabin. The other three models include them standard.\n\nSafety\nIn the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2015 Lexus RC coupe is a star, earning the top rating of good in all tests. Its optional collision warning and avoidance system is classified as advanced, one step below the top score of superior.\n\nWhere the institute categorizes the RC as a large luxury car, it classifies the M4 (3 Series) as a midsize. The M3 sedan earns a disappointing rating of marginal (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front test. Where the coupe shares frontal results, it hasn’t been tested separately for side and other crashes. Its optional forward collision warning and avoidance system is rated advanced.\n\nThe new ATS hasn’t been tested yet, but IIHS rates its optional collision warning and avoidance system superior.\n\nThe RC F offers a backup camera only in navigation packages, but parking sensors are a stand-alone option.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn cars like these, performance plays into the value determination more than it does for common cars. While the RC F is reasonably satisfying in its own right, under the harsh light of competition it shows room for improvement.\n\nDitto for features. It’s not just about cost versus what appears on the features lists; it’s about alternatives. For example, the ATS-V we drove managed to hit $74,450 as equipped without a full navigation system, but in that case one could rely on a mobile device or OnStar to send directions digitally that CUE then displays and vocalizes as turn-by-turn guidance. What the Cadillac does include standard is an adaptive suspension.\n\nNow compare the RC F: There’s no fix for a tighter interior, a backseat that doesn’t fold, a frustrating media controller, heavier weight, less torque and no adaptive suspension available.\n\nThe M4 in our test managed to be $11,000 more than the Lexus as equipped, but by eliminating the brake upgrade, LED headlight option and premium stereo, you could even out the prices without changing the overall performance picture. The M4 isn’t cheap, but at least it offers many stand-alone options rather than only bundled packages. For performance, at least, its value rated highly.\n\nCars.com’s judges rated the ATS-V’s value highest with an average score of 7.4. The M4 earned 6 points and the RC F trailed with 5.4.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four people and features four engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. RWD and AWD  versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The RWD RC uses an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus also sells the high-performance RWD RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. With the discontinuation of the Audi A5 coupe and convertible for 2025, the RC competes primarily with the BMW 4 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe bulk of the RC lineup sees no significant changes for 2025, the car’s swan-song year. The exception is the line-topping RC F, which now comes solely in a specially trimmed (and extra-pricey) Final Edition version with cosmetic upgrades that include BBS wheels and a carbon-fiber roof, plus luxury features such as heated and ventilated front seats and additional leather trim. The RC F Final Edition also gets a standard 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but — like a lot of coupes — its backseat is snug. And while the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sports coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. The RC’s core design is a decade old, and the market for two-door coupes of any stripe has waned considerably in recent years, making the RC’s discontinuation not too surprising. Even so, all versions of the RC have their charms; if you fancy this car’s blend of style, performance and luxury, you’ll want to act fast.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 about the 2015 Lexus RC F. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Lexus RC F coupe is a fun performance coupe that improves on the IS F sedan, but it falls behind competitors on a racetrack.\n\nThe discontinued IS F sedan, which was Lexus’ first attempt to take on performance cars from BMW, Cadillac and other luxury brands, was too squirrely, disjointed and awkward-looking.\n\nThe RC F is a high-performance version of Lexus’ new rear-wheel-drive coupe, the 2015 RC 350 — not to be confused with the mildly souped-up version that’s confusingly named the RC 350 F Sport. Based on price and specifications, the RC F compares to the BMW M4 (the renamed M3 Coupe) and the new 2016 Cadillac ATS-V. All three competed in our recent Luxury Performance Coupe Challenge, in which four editors and one consumer graded and ranked the cars in many categories. The Audi RS 5 is another alternative for performance-coupe shoppers. (Compare all four side-by-side here.)\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe RC F has Lexus’ boldest front end yet, characterized by the largest execution of what the company calls its spindle-shaped grille. I’d call it a distorted hourglass instead, as I suspect few Lexus shoppers do their own tailoring and/or are colonial historians.\n\nWhile the RC 350 F Sport looks darn close to the RC F, a larger front bumper vent in front of each wheel — for more effective brake cooling — gives away the top dog.\n\nThough Lexus’ new design movement is divisive, the RC F was pretty well received among passers-by, especially the one with a deep-blue Ultrasonic Blue Mica 2.0 paint job.\n\nAs an option, shoppers can opt for a Performance Package that adds a visible carbon fiber rear spoiler and carbon fiber roof. The roof removes weight up high, lowering the car’s center of gravity. Lexus kindly offers an optional glass moonroof as an alternative, which does the opposite.\n\nHow It Drives\nI view the RC F’s driving experience from a few perspectives: on its own merit, versus the IS F, and versus the BMW and Cadillac.\n\nIt’s most impressive when compared with the retired IS F sedan. Last sold as a 2014, the IS F marked the debut of Lexus’ F performance division, and I never liked driving it. It was squirrely, with an unruly rear end and countermeasures too clumsy to control it. The RC F brings things more in line without sacrificing the playful character of a tail that’s willing to slide out — and a stability system that allows it to do so without being overly limiting. (The M4’s stability system, even in a relaxed mode called MDM, is a complete buzzkill — a surprise to us all.)\n\nThe RC F is controllable, but there’s no doubt it’s more of a tail-wagger than the other two cars in our Challenge. It comes standard with a Torsen mechanical limited-slip differential, but our Challenge car had the optional Torque Vectoring Differential as part of the Performance Package. A TVD button on the center console controls it, providing Standard, Slalom and Track modes that vary how the electronically controlled clutch packs distribute torque left and right. When I drove this car on the Monticello Motor Club private racetrack in New York state, I thought it did a good job. After experimenting with it head-to-head against the BMW and Cadillac at the Autobahn Country Club track in Joliet, Ill., I was left wanting perhaps a fourth TVD setting that would glue the tail down and give it comparable road-holding.\n\nLexus cites shift times that are admirably fast for a conventional torque-converter automatic rather than a dual-clutch automatic like Audi and BMW use. The RC F’s eight-speed does shift quickly from one gear to the next — when it shifts — but it hesitates too long before doing so when you jab the pedal in an automatic mode. After an earlier drive where I noticed the hesitation only occasionally, our Challenge car exhibited it more — including a few times when shifting manually via the steering-wheel paddles.\n\nI thought the eight-speed was at its best on the track in the automatic Sport S+ mode. There, it did a good job of picking the right gear and continuously downshifting through the gears as you decelerate. My colleagues were less enthused in one regard, saying the downshifts were too abrupt and occasionally happened midcorner. I’ve come to view competent automatic modes as a necessity with an eight-speed automatic because — as I said of the first such automatic transmission on the market, on the IS F in 2008 — having eight gears proves tedious when shifting manually. Sadly, the Lexus doesn’t offer a proper three-pedal manual transmission like the other two models do.\n\nOur experience with an automatic ATS-V suggests it’s better than the others, but the Cadillac we drove in the Challenge was a manual. Our big surprise was the M4, whose automatic modes seldom found the right gear; we resorted to paddles on that one.\n\nOn the plus side for the M4, it provides the absolute best control over variable characteristics like throttle response, shift speed, power-steering assist, adaptive suspension and stability control. Why? Because the BMW lets the driver control each system independently, and to program one’s preferences into two umbrella modes accessible via buttons on the steering wheel. In the Caddy and Lexus, those modes are predetermined by the manufacturer. The RC F’s Eco, Normal, Sport+ and Sport S+ aren’t very compelling, partly because there’s no adaptive suspension for them to control.\n\nThe RC F tragically doesn’t offer an adaptive suspension even as an option (puzzling because one is available on the lesser RC 350 F Sport). As a standard feature, the ATS-V’s adaptive suspension gives it the best split personality in the test. One could easily say a likely buyer for these cars wouldn’t care too much about ride quality, but knowing a higher level of comfort is possible, as it is in the Caddy, raises the bar.\n\nThough the M4 we drove had an adaptive suspension — a $1,000 option — it failed to deliver a comfortable ride in Comfort mode. Its firmness compared to the RC F’s, but there’s no denying that a computer-controlled adaptive suspension that responds to surfaces and body motions is worth having, even if the firmness is the same as a fixed suspension’s.\n\nNote that during our Challenge we removed the RC F from road-course testing earlier than hoped after it blew bluish-white smoke out the tailpipes. It seemed fine afterward, without so much as a check engine light, so we suspect the high g-forces allowed some motor oil to get past the PCV valve into the intake manifold. Still, out of an abundance of caution, we retired it for the day. The other two cars exhibited no such problem.\n\nIn our drag-strip testing, the RC F did zero to 60 mph in 4.88 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.12 seconds at 109.11 mph. The ATS-V was quicker, hitting 60 mph in 4.32 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.41 at 115.62 mph. The winner was the M4, which made it to 60 mph in 3.97 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.05 at 118.35 mph.\n\nThese are all pretty close, but we grade on the driving experience, as well. Overall, the RC F is undeniably a performer, quicker and more capable than most vehicles on the road. Having eight speeds to work with, it’s reasonably quick off the line, but its torque deficit is indeed felt in the seat of your pants.\n\nWhile specifications aren’t a guarantee, the RC F’s predict the results above pretty well versus the BMW and Cadillac. Though it has the highest horsepower rating, at 467 hp versus the M4’s 425 and the ATS-V’s 464 hp, the Lexus’ torque rating is the lowest, at 389 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The M4 has 406 pounds-feet at a low 1,850 rpm, and the ATS-V has the most: 445 pounds-feet at 3,500 rpm. The Lexus is also the heaviest, at 3,958 pounds. That’s a significant 258 pounds more than the Cadillac and 373 pounds more than the M4 with an automatic transmission. (For those keeping score, the RS 5, which wasn’t provided for the Challenge, weighs the most, at 4,009 pounds, and has the lowest torque rating: 317 pounds-feet at 4,000 rpm.)\n\nWhat’s a bit disappointing is that there’s no apparent advantage to the RC F’s engine having two cylinders more than the other cars, except maybe better sound outside the car. The RC F employs a 5.0-liter V-8 where the BMW and Caddy have turbocharged V-6s. The days of anemic, low-rev turbocharged engines are over; in fact, it’s swung the other way. The RC’s normally aspirated V-8 (like the Audi’s and the one BMW abandoned when it engineered the current-generation M3 and M4) delivers the kind of modest off-the-line acceleration we once endured from small turbocharged engines, a tuning designed to save fuel.\n\nThe strategy works, sort of. In our mileage test, the Lexus achieved 24.26 mpg in combined driving, beating the BMW’s 23.46 mpg and the Cadillac’s 22.9 mpg (the latter with a six-speed manual). This suggests our drive loop skewed more toward highway driving, as the Lexus has an EPA highway rating of 25 mpg, where the M4 automatic is 24 mpg and the ATS-V manual is 23 mpg. In more balanced city/highway driving, the EPA predicts all three cars will get 19 mpg. (The RS 5 is rated 18 mpg combined.)\n\nIn our braking tests, the RC F took the longest, stopping from 60 mph to zero in 127.68 feet. The Caddy was best at 119.47 feet. The BMW required 122.85 feet — surprising because it had $8,150 optional brakes. Those carbon-ceramic designs are intended primarily to resist fade, though, which they did — lap after lap on the road course. Unfortunately, the RC F’s track time — and thus fade testing — was cut short by the cloud of smoke. In normal street braking, I thought the Lexus and Cadillac were only reasonably linear on application and less so on release. The BMW’s pedal was the best.\n\nInterior\nDespite the RC F being fractions of an inch longer than the others externally, some of its interior dimensions are smaller. Most important, rear legroom is about 6 inches shy of the other cars and shoulder room is 3 to 5 inches less. For internal space, the M4 is the clear leader. None of these cars’ backseats are very accommodating for adults, but the RC F is the least comfortable. Its most generous dimension is front-seat legroom, but our unlikely collection of 6-foot-plus editors and guest consumer had no complaints about the other cars’ in this regard.\n\nThe RC F certainly features luxury appointments, but we found fault with it, too, partly due to inconsistency among the materials. To me, the gray plastic of the center console seemed like it belonged on a cheaper car. Quality is about feel, sound and interaction, too, and there’s no separating the car’s interior quality from the experience of its touchpad-based control system, which seems to be universally loathed (more details in the next section).\n\nAmong the Cars.com judges, the RC F averaged 6 points (out of a possible 10) for interior quality, just behind the ATS-V’s 6.7 points. The Cadillac’s low rating was due in part to its similarly unpopular Cadillac User Experience control interface. Our test M4, as equipped, scored highest with 8 points; its once-reviled iDrive interface is now a relative high point.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLexus will find no greater sympathizer than me for its Remote Touch Interface. Absent my preferred touch-screen, I like the idea of random access — the ability to move a pointer to an onscreen button or keyboard selection rather than scrolling through menus with a rotary knob, like the German brands require. When Lexus introduced its Remote Touch Interface, I was the only Cars.com editor who liked it (see the video tour). Unfortunately, it’s been redesigned twice since then and each time it’s been degraded. Now, equipped with a touchpad, it’s a huge turnoff to me and a confirmed deal-breaker for some shoppers. (The upcoming 2016 Lexus RX has a system that looks a lot like the original version, which seems a clear recognition of both the problem and my brilliance. Well, maybe just the first part.)\n\nAs bad as the touchpad interface already is, when combined with the RC F’s bumpy ride it’s often unusable. Lining up and activating, say, a zoom button on the map without instead clicking on the map itself proved a near impossibility.\n\nIf you want to pass on RTI (bundled in either a $1,760 or $2,840 option package), you’ll also go without a navigation system, backup camera, internet radio stations including iHeartRadio, Pandora and Slacker, plus other apps in the Enform App Suite, such as Bing, Yelp, Facebook Places, Movietickets.com, OpenTable, Stocks, Fuel Prices and Sports. You’ll also sacrifice a second USB port.\n\nThe standard audio setup includes a 7-inch display, 10 speakers, satellite radio (subscription required after 90 days), an in-dash CD player and Bluetooth wireless audio streaming and hands-free telephone support. There’s also a single USB port and analog auxiliary jack.\n\nIn the Controls & Multimedia category, Cars.com judges awarded the BMW 7.7 points, the Caddy 5.0 points and the Lexus 3.7 points on average.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith 10.1 cubic feet of volume, the RC F’s trunk was the smallest of the three Challenge cars, just behind the ATS-V’s 10.4 cubic feet. The M4 has 11.0 cubic feet. The RS 5 outdoes them all with 12.2 cubic feet.\n\nWhat’s disappointing about the Lexus is its lack of folding rear seats to extend the cargo area into the cabin. The other three models include them standard.\n\nSafety\nIn the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2015 Lexus RC coupe is a star, earning the top rating of good in all tests. Its optional collision warning and avoidance system is classified as advanced, one step below the top score of superior.\n\nWhere the institute categorizes the RC as a large luxury car, it classifies the M4 (3 Series) as a midsize. The M3 sedan earns a disappointing rating of marginal (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in the small overlap front test. Where the coupe shares frontal results, it hasn’t been tested separately for side and other crashes. Its optional forward collision warning and avoidance system is rated advanced.\n\nThe new ATS hasn’t been tested yet, but IIHS rates its optional collision warning and avoidance system superior.\n\nThe RC F offers a backup camera only in navigation packages, but parking sensors are a stand-alone option.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn cars like these, performance plays into the value determination more than it does for common cars. While the RC F is reasonably satisfying in its own right, under the harsh light of competition it shows room for improvement.\n\nDitto for features. It’s not just about cost versus what appears on the features lists; it’s about alternatives. For example, the ATS-V we drove managed to hit $74,450 as equipped without a full navigation system, but in that case one could rely on a mobile device or OnStar to send directions digitally that CUE then displays and vocalizes as turn-by-turn guidance. What the Cadillac does include standard is an adaptive suspension.\n\nNow compare the RC F: There’s no fix for a tighter interior, a backseat that doesn’t fold, a frustrating media controller, heavier weight, less torque and no adaptive suspension available.\n\nThe M4 in our test managed to be $11,000 more than the Lexus as equipped, but by eliminating the brake upgrade, LED headlight option and premium stereo, you could even out the prices without changing the overall performance picture. The M4 isn’t cheap, but at least it offers many stand-alone options rather than only bundled packages. For performance, at least, its value rated highly.\n\nCars.com’s judges rated the ATS-V’s value highest with an average score of 7.4. The M4 earned 6 points and the RC F trailed with 5.4.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nThe 2019 Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats up to four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F is powered by a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8.\n\nRear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive versions have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Cadillac ATS.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nExterior changes include revised front and rear styling while the cabin gets some trim changes. Suspension and power-steering tuning has been updated, and the turbo four-cylinder's control unit has been reprogrammed for optimized response, according to Lexus. Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and Amazon Alexa integration are now standard.\n\nThe RC F gets a new limited-edition 10th Anniversary Special Edition that features matte-gray paint, blue Brembo brake calipers, black 19-inch forged BBS wheels, blue leather interior trim and blue carbon fiber accents. Only 240 will be available in the U.S.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard convenience features include push-button start, dual-zone air conditioning, power-adjustable heated front seats and a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Options include a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a power moonroof, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo.\n\nStandard active safety features include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes the backseat is snug. We're also not fans of Lexus' touchpad-based multimedia interface. The high-output RC F provides some thrills but isn't as entertaining as you might expect for a top performance model.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series. \n\nLexus also sells the high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard. A new Black Line Special Edition based on the F Sport trim features triple-beam LED headlights, 19-inch black-chrome wheels, darkened exhaust tips, a black interior with silver-colored stitching, ash wood trim and a two-piece Zero Halliburton luggage set. Just 350 will be produced. \n\nRarer still is the new RC F Fuji Speedway Edition that’s limited to 60 units. It features Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a titanium exhaust system, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements and red leather-trimmed seats with Alcantara simulated-suede trim. A limited-production MSTR watch with design cues inspired by the car is also included.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPush-button start\nDual-zone air conditioning\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \nMark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, the backseat is snug. We’re also not fans of Lexus’ touchpad-based multimedia interface.",

It is, however, the last year Lexus will offer the RC F Track Edition, a pricey (six-figure) performance-oriented special edition that features a carbon-fiber hood, roof and rear wing, as well as Hitachi shock absorbers, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, and a unique black-and-blue synthetic suede interior.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\n Standard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation\n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, its backseat is snug. Competitors like the Audi A5 and S5 and the BMW 4 Series have fresher designs than the Lexus, and their more modern powertrains return better fuel economy. While the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sport-coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. Also, the Lexus Track Edition’s nearly $33,000 upcharge over the base RC F feels awfully steep for some carbon-fiber body panels.",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus RC lineup is receiving light updates for the 2023 model year, mostly regarding the cabin, in an attempt to help it stay competitive against rivals like the BMW 4 Series. The changes bump costs up $1,500 to start, and the luxury coupe now is priced from $45,470 (all pricing includes the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RC F Track Edition Quick Spin: Is the Ultimate RC Enough to Finally Find Love?\n\nThe interiors for the RC 300, RC 350 and line-topping RC F are largely carried over, but the infotainment system lineup has been shuffled around. All models get an 8-inch touchscreen standard, but an updated 10.3-inch touchscreen is also available. Trim on the glove box, instrument panel and side registers has also been revised, as well.\n\nThe RC’s exterior styling remains much the same, but for the RC 350, an available F Sport Special Appearance Package adds a two-tone exterior color combination, 19-inch Enkei dark-alloy wheels and a new paint color called Incognito. The RC F Track Edition will now also offer the Incognito color.\n\nPerformance hardware will once again include a trio of engine options. The base RC 300 comes with rear-wheel drive and is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while all-wheel-drive variants get a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. RC 350 models get a 311-hp version of the V-6, and RC F models retain the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 472 hp and comes with RWD only. RWD variants use an eight-speed automatic transmission; AWD models get a six-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Lexus RC and RC F are expected to arrive in dealerships early in 2023. Full pricing is below:\n\nRC 300: $45,470\nRC 300 AWD: $48,160\nRC 300 F Sport: $50,090\nRC 300 F Sport AWD: $52,380\nRC 350: $48,400\nRC 350 AWD: $50,565\nRC 350 F Sport: $53,020\nRC 350 F Sport AWD: $54,745\nRC F: $67,845\nRC F Track Edition: $100,720\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Lexus RC 300 F Sport Quick Spin: Less Than Meets the Eye\n2020 Lexus RC F and RC F Track Edition: Performance Pumped\nOur view: 2016 Lexus RC 350\nWhat’s the Best Lexus Performance Car?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2020 Lexus RC F Track Edition marks the fourth version of Lexus’ performance coupe that I’ve tested, and it’s also the most special. Lexus updated the RC F for 2020 and, in doing so, tossed in a limited-run, sharpened version of the car called the Track Edition. Although the name sounds somewhat run of the mill, it’s a rare bird indeed: Lexus will build a very limited number of these with only around 100 making it to the U.S. And only one — a prototype — spent the week with me.\n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus RC 300 F Sport Quick Spin: Less Than Meets the Eye\n\nIf you think of the Track Edition as the ultimate version of the RC, this is about as performance-focused as it gets without gutting the interior, throwing in a roll cage and turning it into a track-only racecar. After a week, I have an interesting relationship with the RC F Track Edition.\n\nThat’s because I’ve always harbored high hopes for the RC. Since it debuted, I found myself enamored with its look and feel. The problem has always been that it’s a bit of a drag to drive. The RC 300 F Sport that I tested earlier this year left me wanting; the RC F that I tested previously was good but didn’t wow me enough.\n\nThat brings us to this: the end of the line. If I can’t love a limited-edition, matte-wrapped performance version of the RC, then perhaps it’s just not meant to be.\n\nWhat Makes It a Track Edition?\n\nThe easiest way to pick out an RC F Track Edition is the large carbon fiber wing bolted on the trunk. Lexus could have also called it the Carbon Fiber Edition, because the lightweight stuff is everywhere: the hood and roof, all over the interior (where it has an attractive red hue) and the front and rear splitters. Those changes combine with carbon-ceramic brakes, ultra-lightweight 19-inch BBS alloy wheels and a titanium muffler to shave 121 pounds off the regular RC F.\n\nThe engine carries over from the standard RC F: a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 with 472 horsepower and 395 pounds-feet of torque. Power hits the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The regular RC F has an optional torque-vectoring differential, but the Track Edition doesn’t get that — just a Torsen limited-slip differential that leaves the back end feeling a mite twitchy.\n\nSharpened Edges\n\nPredictably, this is the quickest and most capable RC I’ve tested. The weight savings plus an electronic launch-control system lower the zero-to-60 mph time to 3.96 seconds versus the regular RC F’s 4.2 seconds, Lexus says. Driving the Track Edition took a bit of time to get used to, however: Many modern performance cars employ turbochargers and superchargers, so to drive a big, naturally aspirated engine feels like a throwback. There’s less burst of initial acceleration, but once the engine revs up and starts to sing, it’s an invigorating experience. The engine is a highlight — much like it was in the previous RC F I tested — once you figure out how to keep it in its power band.\n\n2020 Lexus RC F Track Edition | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe transmission helps out once it’s in its most aggressive drive mode, called Sport Plus. It holds lower gears plenty long enough for the engine to do its thing, though I used the paddle shifters a few times on trickier roads to keep the V-8 firmly in its power band. Though the transmission is good, it still feels a cut below the best transmissions in the class — think Porsche’s PDK dual-clutch automatic and BMW’s eight-speed auto, both benchmarks.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Track Edition curiously eschews the standard RC F’s torque-vectoring differential for a simpler limited-slip, which introduces some tail happiness that I started to notice on my second hard stint in the car. Unless you’re a professional high-performance driver, it’s best to keep the electronic stability system on if you want to keep the nose from switching ends. The Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires provide plenty of grip, but when they give up, the back end starts to move and things can get hairy pretty fast.\n\nI still don’t love the RC F’s steering. It lacks much weightiness or feedback — fine for normal driving, but with this much power to the rear wheels, a bit more feedback would be welcome. There’s more initial bite at the front end for the updated car, which dials back much understeer; that’s a welcome change.\n\nAdaptive shock absorbers are standard, and a big difference exists in how they behave in each drive mode. In the Normal mode, the shocks are what you’d expect in a Lexus: soft, absorbing road imperfections and rolling along with nary a sound. Toss it into Sport Plus, however, and the ride gets much firmer. This is really what you want out of an adaptive suspension, to tell  clearly the difference between drive modes and pick the right setting for your situation. Kudos to Lexus for building in enough pliability for day-to-day usage or stiffness for a winding road or racetrack.\n\nWait, How Much?\n\nThe Track Edition is by far my favorite version of the RC. It’s the sharpest car to drive, looks the part and has a big V-8. Toss those ingredients together, and you can get me to show up pretty much anywhere. There is one big problem though for the Track Edition, aside from its scant availability: the price.\n\nThe 2020 RC F Track Edition starts at $97,675 including destination, or $31,900 more than the standard RC F. That’s a tough pill to swallow even when you factor in the car’s exclusivity. It lacks enough performance boost to justify the added cost. If you’re going to raise the price by nearly 50 percent, it needs more changes — and moderately quicker acceleration plus more carbon fiber won’t cut it.\n\nAnd while the Track Edition might be the best RC for me, it still isn’t quite enough to get me to really fall in love with the car. There are things that I like about it, to be sure, but I didn’t come out feeling wowed — and that’s what it would take to get me on board with the Track Edition and its price tag. Love still has to wait, it seems.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
