      "expert_review": "A couple of decades ago there basically were three major competitors for the luxury-car market in the United States – Cadillac, Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nNow there’s no dearth of luxury makes, with some faring better than others.\n\nOne of the better success stories is Lexus, and this division of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. has introduced an entirely new LS 400 model for 1995.\n\nA four-door sedan, it exceeds its predecessor in virtually every respect, from technology to exterior and interior styling, and to the personal attributes demanded by luxury-car buyers.\n\n“It’s the hardest model that we have to keep in inventory,” said Michael Drumwright, master sales consultant for Tom Wood Lexus. “Most are sold before we even get them.”\n\nFrom the front to the back, from the bottom to the top, this 1995 model features change.\n\nTake styling. The exterior has a more muscular, sharply chiseled look, without abandoning the Lexus identity.\n\nThe grille is farther forward and its corners have been beveled for a sharper-edged look. Complex fender character lines flow from the headlights to the windshield to give a twisted-ribbon effect. A raised belt line flows from the front fenders to the rear fenders.\n\nBut when all is said and done, it still looks like a Lexus.\n\nInside, convenience features abound in all directions.\n\nLexus says it’s the first automaker to offer an in-dash six-disc CD autochanger (most are in the trunk).\n\nThe space-efficient packaging of the instrument panel is made possible by a unique film-dampening heating and air conditioning system that has a higher capacity, yet is 25 percent more compact than the previous system. With automatic temperature controls, solar sensors differentiate temperatures for the sunny and shady sides of the car.\n\nLexus, which sort of pioneered the power tilt and telescope steering wheel on the American market, offers a newly standardized system for its ’95 LS 400.\n\nLuxury-sedan buyers are a fussy bunch with definite ideas of what they like and don’t like. One of the prime features they like is room and comfort, and the LS addresses this in a rather fundamental way: A lengthened wheelbase.\n\nIt’s now out to 112.2 inches, a stretch of 1.4 inches, giving rear-seat occupants 2.6 inches more legroom. The company claims total legroom rivals that of many larger and heavier competitors.\n\nAs luxury cars go, the LS 400 isn’t a particularly heavy automobile, with a rated curb weight of 3,650 pounds. You can chalk that up to computer analysis and design that trimmed the weight by more than 200 pounds. And this, in turn, has improved performance and operating efficiency.\n\nThe engine is a redesigned 4.0-liter (242-cubic-inch), 32- valve aluminum V8. Thanks to more power and torque and the lighter weight, acceleration matches or exceeds that of some 4.5-liter engines.\n\nWhile all upscale luxury cars are going to overhead cams for their powerplants, the LS 400 has always had one.\n\nWith four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, this upgraded 242-cubic-incher now develops 260 horsepower, up from 250. Torque also is increased 10 foot-pounds to 270 foot-pounds.\n\nThe basic design of the V8 is unchanged, but by raising the compression ratio, increasing the valve lift and revising the exhaust manifolds for improved scavenging, more power has been obtained from the same 242 inches.\n\nCoupled with the lighter weight, 0-60 mph acceleration times are 1 second quicker. And for flat-to-the-floor running, be sure you’ve got it pointed in the right direction. Top speed is rated at 150 mph.\n\nThe transmission is an electronically controlled four-speed automatic, of course. But as a concession to those with a yearning to do it themselves but who don’t really want to be bothered most of the time, there’s a stepped shift-gate that allows manual shifting.\n\nThe LS 400 is a driver-oriented car, with its double-wishbone independent front suspension redesigned for more precise steering control. Front-whee l caster h as been reduced so the initial turn-in is much more accurate.\n\nWhile the wheelbase has been lengthened, the turning circle is reduced to 34.8 feet, down from the predecessor’s 36 feet. Steering with this car is dead-on, with only minute movements of the wheel needed to change lanes or pull out to pass.\n\n1995 Lexus LS 400 Base price: $51,200.Type: Front engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger, luxury sedan.Engine: 4.0-liters, DOHC V-8, 32 valves, fuel injected, 260-horsepower, 270 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Mileage: 19 mpg city; 25 mpg highway,Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 7.4 seconds.Top speed: 150 mph.Wheelbase: 112.2 inches.Length: 196.7 inches.Width: 72.0 inches.Height: 55.7 inches.Curb weight: 3,650 pounds.Options: Premium stereo system, CD/Autochanger, memory seating, Trac-Control, power sunroof, air suspension.",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus LS 400 and GS 400:\n\nBoth are built by the same luxury-car division of Toyota Motors. Both are expensive, have four doors and are powered by nearly identical V-8 engines. Yet they are as different as Abbott and Costello.\n\nThe LS 400 is Lexus’ bread-and-butter luxury sedan, its flagship and traditional standard bearer. Comfortable, prestigious, laden with features, the LS is a boulevard cruiser designed for the best neighborhoods.\n\nThe LS 400 is where Lexus first made its mark, showing the world that a Japanese automaker could compete head-on with the high-end luxury marques of Europe and the United States. It’s a big, competent sedan that does everything with poise and precision, but which often is faulted for lacking spirit, flair or personality.\n\nThat’s where the GS 400 comes in. The GS is agile, athletic and as fast as a ’60s muscle car. The GS is firm where the LS is soft. The GS is hyper where the LS is sedate. The GS’ handling is taut and its steering is responsive, where the LS rolls with the punches and steers with the lightest touch.\n\nThe LS gently coddles its passengers, riding like a cloud over the bumps and heaves, isolating driver and passengers from the rough edges of the outside world. The GS is firm, allowing some jostling of the human cargo but still keeping harshness at bay.\n\nPersonally, the LS is the kind of car that makes me yawn. Its styling and behavior shout, “I’m lush and expensive,” but not much else. Sure, I can appreciate the easy-chair comfort and the fabulous stereo, but I don’t relish the limousine ride.\n\nThe GS, on the other hand, has the kind of performance edge that keeps me interested. I never could own a car like this, though. It’s just too quick, too easy to roar past the speed limit without a glance back, at least until you see those blinking red lights coming up in the rearview mirror.\n\nThere is also a GS 300, powered by a 225-horsepower V-6, which should perform most tasks as enjoyably as the V-8 model, only without the strong acceleration.\n\nThe GS 400 works well as a performance sedan, along the lines of BMW 540i, Mercedes-Benz C43 or even Cadillac Seville STS. It’s a car built to inspire, especially on winding desert blacktop where one can sample the precise suspension and balance of this rear-wheel-drive car, and enjoy the opportunity to make the engine sing.\n\nJust be careful not to overdo it. The acceleration is intoxicating, smooth as silk and so easy to push to the limit. The engine roar is heavily muffled, the urgent sound audible from the driver’s seat but not howling for attention.\n\nYes, this is a toy for grown-ups, not kids.\n\nStill, part of the complaint about the LS carries over to the GS. The feeling of strength, precision and excellent engineering is evident throughout the car, but somehow it fails to impart much of a visceral impression. It’s a great machine, but it failed to touch me on an emotional level.\n\nNow, that’s pretty subjective stuff, an d maybe the problem is mine and not the automobile’s. It’s just that some cars make you feel like a partner, even a pal, sharing their abilities and making them your own.\n\nThe GS always seems to be trying to impress, which it does. Matter of fact, this felt like one of the quickest cars I’ve ever driven, whatever the numbers say. What they do say is the 300-horsepower V-8 and five-speed automatic will pull the trim sedan from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds. That’s pretty fast in anyone’s book.\n\nThe LS is no slouch in the acceleration department, sprinting to 60 in about 6.6 seconds, Lexus says, the slightly greater weight and slightly less horsepower slowing things just a bit, compared with GS. Indeed, the Lexus literature touts the performance abilities of the LS, noting that it is a car of “dual personalities,” luxurious and sporting.\n\nI found it heavily weighted on the luxury side of the equation.\n\nThe test-car GS came with buttons on the steering whe el for manual sh ifting, if desired, which I found useful when downshifting into and powering out of a curve. The Lexus system also is more helpful and easier to use than the push-button shifting systems offered on other sporting cars. Still, it’s kind of a gimmick, and most drivers rarely would use the feature, if ever, once the novelty wears off.\n\nThe LS 400 was equipped with a global positioning system, with a video display showing maps and directions. It worked well, but as part of a $5,400 package of GPS, compact-disc changer and power moonroof, it seems overly expensive. In the GS, a CD changer and moonroof were just over $2,000 extra.\n\nThe GS styling looks trim and muscular, tucked in around the edges to make the midsize sedan look smaller than it really is. The 2-year-old body style is distinctive and instantly recognizable, though in some ways it looks almost like a variation on the current Mercedes E-class. The LS obviously takes some of its overall styling cues from the Benz design book.\n\nInside, the GS is fairly spacious, with lots of room behind the wheel for tall drivers and enough room in the back seat for tall offspring.\n\nThe LS feels even more roomy and accommodating, designed with lots of wood and leather. The dashboard looks European, rather like an Audi’s or even a Jaguar’s, with controls and gauges that are well-designed and logically arranged.\n\nDitto for the GS, though its interior seems more distinctive and less derivative.\n\nNaturally, both of these pricey sedans come equipped with a full boatload of accessories, convenience equipment and safety features. A standard Vehicle Control System makes use of the anti-lock braking and traction control to help you keep things under control.\n\nThough the GS is just 2 years old, I’m confident that it will enjoy the same sort of dependability of all Lexus products. That’s part of the draw for these high-end cars, whichever side of the coin you choose: the indisputable fact that they are well-made and extremely reliable.\n\n1999 Lexus LS 400 and GS 400\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedans, rear-wheel drive. Base price: LS: $53,505. GS: $45,505. Price as tested: LS: $59,570. GS: $48,804. Engine: 4-liter V-8, 290 (LS)/300 (GS) horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 300 (LS)/310 (GS) pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Curb weight: LS: 3,890 pounds. GS: 3,638 pounds. LS highs: Comfort. Competence. GS highs: Muscle-car power. Handling. LS lows: Too isolating. Personality deficit. GS lows: Derivative styling.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe top-of-the-line Lexus sedan bolsters its brakes as the biggest change for 2000. The new Brake Assist feature senses when the driver is making a panic stop and applies maximum braking force faster than the driver’s foot can travel.\n\nThe rear-drive LS400 is the most expensive sedan from Lexus, Toyota’s luxury division. With a starting price of around $54,000, it competes with luxury sedans such as the BMW 5 Series and 7 Series, Infiniti Q45, Jaguar XJ8 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class.\n\nLexus will replace the LS400 for 2001 with a redesigned model powered by a new 4.3-liter V-8 and dubbed the LS430.\n\nExterior\nFrom some angles, the understated styling of the LS400 makes it look smaller than its 197-inch overall length, which is about the same as the BMW 740i and Jaguar XJ8.\n\nSixteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, and chromed alloy wheels are optional. This year, buyers who order the chromed version also get a chrome wheel for the full-size spare.\n\nInterior\nInterior attractions in the lavishly outfitted LS400 include a dazzling light show every time you turn on the ignition and the bright, colorful electronic gauges spring into action. The interior is trimmed with leather upholstery and California walnut wood.\n\nThe Lexus LS400 features an optional navigation system with a 6-inch LCD screen to point you in the right direction.\n\nAdults have ample room to stretch their legs in the outboard seating positions. The middle rear passenger has to straddle the driveshaft tunnel in the rear-drive LS400, making the rear seat better suited for two.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe LS400 is powered by a smooth, refined 4.0-liter V-8 engine with 290 horsepower. The engine teams with a five-speed automatic transmission that is shared with the GS300/400.\n\nPerformance\nLS400 sales have slipped as buyers have turned to other luxury sedans, sport utility vehicles and sports cars, many of which offer more excitement, either dynamically or visually. The best things about the LS400 are its impeccable quality and the excellent service Lexus gives its customers.\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com",

      "expert_review": "It’s hard to find fault with the 1993 version of Toyota’s Lexus LS 400.\n\nBut I did.\n\nThere was a loose thread on the passenger seat of this week’s test car, a beige LS 400 packed with all the goodies Toyota has to offer.\n\nBut loose thread or no, the LS 400 had me all sewn up after 300 exceptionally smooth and quiet miles.\n\nThis V-8-powered Japanese luxury sedan has come to define the luxury car of the 1990s.\n\nAlong with the smoothness and quietness, the LS 400 offers impeccable quality and service – in the unlikely event you would need it – that is tops in the industry. Couple that with a resale value that Toyota claims no other car can match and you have America’s best-selling imported luxury car.\n\nMercedes, BMW and Nissan’s Infiniti have nothing even close to the LS 400 in sales.\n\nEven though the LS 400’s price has risen dramatically, the car still is a world-class bargain.\n\nHere’s the bottom line: If you are looking for a Mercedes-Benz type of luxury car, you will pay more and get less if you buy anything other than a LS 400.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe smoothness of the LS 400’s 32-valve, four-cam 250-horsepower V-8 engine has become almost legendary.\n\nTurning the ignition key provokes little in the way of noise or vibration. You don’t hear or feel the engine. If you want to hear what’s going on under the hood, you must floor the accelerator and simultaneously strain your ears.\n\nAlthough Toyota engineers have made a myriad of improvements to the LS 400 since its debut about three years ago, they have more or less left alone the engine and the four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAs well they should. Why tinker with perfection?\n\nPower is abundant once you get moving. I found the LS 400 to be a bit leisurely from a stop. However, once the engine reaches about 3,000 rpm, the LS 400 takes flight.\n\nBut if you drive with a lead foot, you will pay the price at the gas pump. The test car returned a little more than14 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving – well under its EPA rating.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe test car’s sticker price included a $1,500 charge for Lexus’ air-controlled suspension system, which allows the car to be raised or lowered slightly to improve handling. This is something most drivers easily can live without. I’ve driven the standard LS 400, and there isn’t $1,500 worth of difference in the ride.\n\nFor 1993,the LS 400’s four-wheel power anti-lock disc brakes were the recipient of one of the car’s more functional improvements. They are now larger and more powerful. Fast-acting and with plenty of bite, the LS 400’s brakes are BMW-like in quality. That is to say they’re terrific.\n\nThe responsive vehicle-speed-sensing power rack-and-pinion steering also is a high point in the LS 400. It helps make driving the LS 400 nearly effortless.\n\nUnlike a comparable Mercedes-Benz sedan, you don’t sense a heavy, unwieldy demeanor in the LS 400. The car is agile, light on its feet – or, tires – and a joy to drive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nAside from that loose thread, everything was perfect in the test car.\n\nThe accessories worked with all the smoothness and dependable robot like precision we have come to expect from Japanese products.\n\nThe test car is loaded with power accessories. That included the passenger seat, which now has the same seven-way adjustment as the driver’s seat.\n\nAdded equipment is one reason the LS 400’s price has risen so dramatically.\n\nFor 1993, the LS 400 gets dual air bags, bigger tires and wheels (they’re now 16 inches instead of 15 inches) and a few very minor styling upgrades. The grille is different than the one on last year’s model, and the lower body cladding has been made thicker to improve resistance to minor dings and dents.\n\nOn the inside, the 1993 model is pre-wired for two types of cellular phones, and the stereo system has been given a healthy increase in wattage.\n\nThe leather-covered seats and the wood-lined interior are pretty much the same as they have been for the past three seasons. That’s to say that the interior radiates class.\n\nIf there is a negative aspect of the LS 400, it’s the car’s uninspired styling. One would have thought Toyota’s stylists could have invented a car that looked a little more original. Instead the LS 400 is blatant rip-off of a Mercedes-Benz sedan.\n\nTruett’s tip: The price of the Lexus LS 400 has risen a shocking $11,000 since September 1989. Even so, the car is not only a bargain, it’s one of the world’s great luxury cars.",

      "expert_review": "There was a time in the history of the American automobile industry when custom-built cars bearing exclusive coachwork from custom body makers were the premier status symbols of the luxury car market.\n\nToday, that custom market has largely disappeared, the exceptions being stretched limousines and one-of-a-kind show cars.\n\nThe Lexus Division of Toyota Motor Co. is putting a little spin of its own on the custom luxury business. Toyota is introducing a 1997 Lexus LS 400 Coach Edition that, from an interior styling standpoint, has all the earmarks of classics from the past.\n\nFederal regulations requiring crash tests and a strict adherence to safety requirements have virtually negated the building of a custom body. So, for its LS 400 Coach Edition, Lexus is working with the body it already makes, customizing the interior.\n\nWorking in partnership with a company called Coach, a renowned manufacturer of distinguished leather goods, this special LS 400 Coach Edition is designed to establish a benchmark for customized luxury sedans.\n\nAs with the custom-built classics of yesteryear, the ’97 Coach Edition is not a mass-produced vehicle. Production will be limited, and it is expected that the model will become a collector’s item.\n\nBody builders such as Murphy, Brunn, Waterhouse and others in the 1930s built products that graced chassis such as the Duesenberg, Stutz, Packard and Lincoln – luxury cars of the era. Not only did the builders make the bodies, but they styled exquisite interiors made up of the finest leathers, silks and woods.\n\nWith its Coach Edition, Lexus is following in some illustrious footsteps when it accentuates with a custom-leather interior.\n\nCoach supplies the leather for the interior of the Coach Edition. That includes not only the upholstery but a leather center console with an embossed Coach logo.\n\nBased on a production LS 400, the Coach Edition is a five-passenger sedan that has the shift lever for the car’s four-speed automatic transmission coming through the top of the center console. The mounting base of the quadrant itself is of a composite material, but is surrounded by Coach leather that goes across the rearward segment of the console and along its sides.\n\nA Coach leather-covered center armrest folds down over the section that goes across the console. Then, there is a styled wood-and-leather accented shift lever knob to complete the custom theme.\n\nA further customizing touch lies in the back seats, where there is a hint of tufting in the right and left side seat backs. The center seat has a Coach leather fold down armrest. To complete the leather theme, the Coach Edition comes with a Coach leather cabin bag finished in British tan.\n\nThis special brand of Coach styling also extends to the floor mats in the interior of the sedan and to the wheels on the exterior.\n\nThe carpeted floor mats bear an embroidered Coach insignia that says LS 400 Coach Edition.\n\nOn the outside, unique five-spoke aluminum alloy wheels have di stinctive symbol markings on their hub centers. Another Coach styling feature is subtle exterior champagne-pearl badging.\n\nThe standard LS 400 is the premier luxury sedan in the Lexus model line, so Toyota had a benchmark automobile on which to found its Coach Edition car.\n\nUnder the hood lies a high-tech 4.0-liter (242-cubic-inch) 32-valve V-8 that sports four overhead cams and produces 260-horsepower. With 260 horses and 270 foot-pounds of torque, the 400 falls into the category of luxury performance.\n\nZero to 60 mph is rated at 7.1 seconds and, if you’re running this thing flat to the floor, you are looking at 149 mph on the top end. Mileage is 19 miles per gallon city, 25 highway.\n\nAt 3,726 pounds curb weight, the four-door can’t be considered light, but can’t be considered really heavy, either. It stands on 112.2 inches of wheelbase and has an overall length of 196.7 inches,size specifications that denote good interior room.\n\nAs expected with a $50,000-plus automobile, featur es like walnut trim, climate control, power accessories and all the trappings that make life worth living are standard in the LS 400.\n\nThe Tom Wood Lexus dealership expects its first Coach Edition at any time. Speculation on price is that it will be around $57,000.",

      "expert_review": "Some people might wonder what a luxury car is. After all, when you can get leather in a Neon, walnut trim in a Camry and power windows or locks on any car, what makes the luxury car worth the extra money?\n\nDrive a 1996 Lexus LS400 and find out.\n\nThere are lots of superlatives one could use to describe the effortless experience of driving this car. But it’s no use — the guys at Lexus are good.\n\nGo on, put the key in the ignition. Every time, you get a free show. The wheel tilts down automatically and the 3-D gauges light up. The whole effect is dazzling.\n\nThen you turn the key.\n\nThe engine starts, but you’d never know it. The 32-valve four-cam V8 generates 260 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. This aluminum alloy plant is remarkable in its power and silence. Mated to a four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, this powertrain performs with a serene, no-fuss, no-bother attitude. It doesn’t let you know it’s there unless you really press it and a subdued roar makes its way into the cabin.\n\nThe suspension is a double wishbone design and provides good insulation from the road. Bumps are smothered with authority and there’s no rear-end hop around corners. You’ll know there are bumps, but their presence will barely be felt.\n\nSteering is progressive and quick, yet light. You won’t have to work out regularly at the gym to hustle this baby through the corners.\n\nNot that you’ll hear very much when you do. There’s no tire noise, wind noise or mechanical noise to spoil the enjoyment of driving in such a wonderful cocoon — even with the power moonroof open.\n\nThis car is dampened.\n\nFrom the ride to such minor interior amenities as cup holders (front and rear), ashtray, and even the coin holder — which is felt-lined — everything just oozes luxury.\n\nThe interior is lined in sumptuously sinful leather, and the dash offers beautifully polished walnut. The multi-adjustable front bucket seats are heated. Dual automatic climate control is standard. The air filtration is electrostatically charged to remove odor, dust and pollen.\n\nThe intermittent windshield washer has a time delay that activates the wiper blade a few moments after the final swipe to catch the last dribble down the windshield.\n\nBut the real treat is the optional Nakamichi 280-watt sound system. The six-CD auto changer is sandwiched in the dash between the glove box and passenger airbag. This system is as impressive as the car. The sound is clean, no matter how high you turn up Haydn. It’s so good, you’ll sit in the garage and listen to it.\n\nSafety is also impressive, with the usual dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, 1997 side impact protection, front-seat belt pre-tensioners, electrochromatic rear-view mirror, and traction control. Keyless entry activates the driver’s door, trunk and panic button. About the only thing this car is missing is a bedroom option, so you could live in it.\n\nEPA mileage rating is 19 city, 26 highway. A round of mostly city driving and some highway driving netted 17.6 mpg on the premium fuel the LS400 requires.\n\nThe Lexus basic warranty is four years or 50,000 miles. The powertrain is covered for six years or 70,000 miles.\n\nSo this is definitely a luxury car, full of all the smothering creature comfort and good road manners that define this category. But is it enough?\n\nThe luxury car market is in decline, as buyers opt for sport utility vehicles. Lexus also faces challenges from revitalized European manufacturers with a clear heritage, such as BMW, Jaguar and Mercedes.\n\nThe overall blandness of the Lexus styling also is problematical — but not as much as what the soaring yen has done to the sticker price. A well-optioned test car like this one costs nearly $60,000. To a lot of people, this is the price of a home.\n\nBut to those lucky enough to have the means and the sense to purchase this car, they’ll dis over what true luxury is.\n\nIt isn’t just leather and wood. It’s a sublime driving experience that rewards its driver every time the key is turned.\n\n1996 LEXUS LS400 Standard equipment: Four-liter V-8, four-speed automatic transmission, front and rear stabilizer bars, power rack-and-pinion steering, 225/60 R16 V-rated tires, dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, dual heated power mirrors, leather trim, walnut trim, outside temperature gauge, power windows with auto down feature, retained accessory power, power door locks, power windows, power driver’s seat, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, dual climate control, AM/FM cassette 195-watt audio system, power antenna, glass-imprinted cellular phone antenna.

      "expert_review": "Toyota has never paid much heed to the old chestnut about “if it ain’t broke …” We’re delighted to find the latest evidence of that stubborn iconoclasm in the redesigned 1998 Lexus LS400.\n\nWe’ve always thought the Lexus flagship was one of the world’s best luxury sedans. And if you believe it’s difficult, if not impossible, to improve on perfection, the latest edition of the LS400 provides convincing evidence to the contrary.\n\nUnfortunately, the price for perfection is dear – nearly $60,000 in the case of the well-equipped LS400 that we sampled.\n\nHe: I’m left with one overwhelming regret after driving the LS400.\n\nShe: If you’re going to start into one of your whiny little tirades about sex or death …\n\nHe: No, no, it’s nothing like that. I haven’t seen any Woody Allen movies for weeks, honest. It’s more about money. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to afford the big Lexus, at least not while we’re still paying tuition bills. I should have listened to Mom. I think she secretly always wanted me to be a doctor.\n\nShe: Speaking of doctors, one of our doctor friends called while we were driving the LS400. He said his mentor, who is also a doctor, was thinking seriously about buying the Lexus, but was a little afraid about the car being rear-wheel drive and having trouble getting around in snow and bad weather. That’s not really a problem with the LS400, especially the ’98 model, which gets a new vehicle skid control system that helps prevent you from spinning or skidding on slick pavement. It’s so good, I don’t think that doctor could tell whether the LS400 was front- or rear-wheel drive unless somebody told him. With this level of safety technology, it’s just not an issue.\n\nHe: I was more impressed by the new drivetrain in the ’98 model. It shares a revised twin-cam 4.0-liter V-8 with the all-new GS400. The engine features variable valve timing, which helps optimize performance while reducing emissions and improving gas mileage. Lexus has coupled this engine with a new five-speed automatic that is smooth and well-geared to take advantage of the V-8’s 290 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque. Acceleration is almost unbelievable – zero to 60 in less than six and a half seconds, which sounds more like a sports car than a luxury sedan that weighs nearly two tons. Talk about a sneaky Pete!\n\nShe: The LS400 is so subdued on the outside. The exterior doesn’t scream “money” or “power.” That might be a problem for some high rollers, who want their neighbors to recognize just how much cash they spent on their new car. The Lexus isn’t flashy at all – not as eye-catching as a Mercedes E-class, with those “eyeball” headlights, or as sleek and sophisticated-looking as a Jaguar XJ8. On the other hand, that could be a plus for members of the medical community and other affluent buyers who want to keep a low profile while enjoying virtually every amenity you can get on a luxury car.\n\nHe: I admire all the li ttle touches that Lexus thought to include in the LS400. Oh, sure, you get all the usual accoutrements, stuff such as full leather upholstery and California walnut trim, an automatic climate system with dual-zone controls and, of course, full power accessories.\n\nBut how many top-of-the-line sedans give you stuff like an air filtration and deodorizing system with smog-sensing auto recirculation? Or auto-dimming electrochromic power outside mirrors that tilt down on the passenger side when you put the car in reverse? This is real high-tech gadgetry, but I also appreciate things like the little retractable coat hooks in the rear and the tool kit in the trunk.\n\nThe only optional feature that really annoyed me was the $2,250 navigation system, which I never did master after a week and several hundred miles in the car. You could eliminate the optional power tilt-and-slide moonroof and snazzy high-intensity discharge headlamps, and save yourself another $1,600. But you may also w to consider options like the air-suspension system and memory system.\n\nShe: OK, so the Lexus had a breathtaking sticker price. You just know some people are going to balk at spending up to $60,000 on a Japanese luxury car. But the LS400 has more going for it than just a powerful engine and a cushy cabin. Safety is outstanding, and that’s reflected in the relatively low insurance rates quoted by AAA of Michigan.\n\nYou get front and side air bags, antilock brakes, traction and skid control and all sorts of additional safety-related features that translate to peace of mind. There’s even a first-aid kit, for heaven’s sake! And the customer care you get at a Lexus dealer is just this side of fantastic.\n\nHe: Plus the LS400 has one of the best bumper-to-bumper warranties in the business – four years or 50,000 miles, plus six years and 70,000 miles on the powertrain. In addition, you get 24-hour roadside assistance for four years and unlimited miles.\n\nShe: If you consider all the intangibles, that $60,000 almost starts to sound like a bargain.\n\nHe: Remind me of that the next time I make a tuition payment.\n\nWhat we liked: Subtle exterior styling doesn’t scream money or ostentation; Almost every amenity that money can buy; Powerful, smooth drivetrain; Superb safety features; Outstanding customer coddling.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Breathtaking price tag with just a few options; High rollers may desire a flashier profile; Navigation system is hardly user-friendly.\n\n1998 Lexus LS400\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $52,900; as tested, $59,290 (inc. $495 destination charge).\n\nNew for ’98: Revised sheet metal, new V-8 engine and five-speed automatic transmission, vehicle skid control, trip computer, multi-function remote entry system, glass-mounted rear antenna, optional HID headlamps.\n\nSafety features: Dual front and side air bags, antilock brakes, vehicle skid control, child-proof rear door locks, height-adjustable shoulder belts, front seat-belt pretensioners, first-aid kit.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Power tilt and slide moonroof ($1,120); heated front seats ($420); wood grain steering wheel ($330); high-intensity headlamps ($500); navigation system ($2,250); in-dash six-CD changer ($1,050); carpeted floor mats ($112); carpeted trunk mat ($65); wheel locks ($48).\n\nEPA fuel economy: n/a.\n\nEngine: 4.0-liter V-8; 290-hp at 6000 rpm; 300 lb-ft torque at 4000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Cadillac Seville, Cadillac DeVille, Lincoln Town Car, Lincoln Continental, Lexus GS400, Acura 3.5RL, Infiniti Q45, Jaguar XJ8, Mercedes-Benz E420, Mercedes-Benz S320, BMW 540i, BMW 740i, Audi A8.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 112.2 inches; overall length, 196.7 inches; curb weight, 3,890 pounds; legroom, 43.7 inches front/36.9 inches rear; headroom, 37.9 inches front/35.7 inches rear; shoulder room, 57 .9 inches front/57.1 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,849. Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is 40 with no tickets and who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.\n\nWhere built: Tahara, Japan",
