      "expert_review": "A soul stirrer\n\nWhen this little Lexus arrived, I was struck by how ordinary it looked. This was supposed to be Lexus’ high-performance sports sedan, but it looked for all the world like a superhero cloaked behind a secret identity. This is not unusual since Lexus’ newest model, the IS 300, started out life as the Toyota Altezza, a model not imported here.\n\nBut don’t think the plebeian lineage has somehow detracted from the heroic pleasure this car imparts.\n\nThe new IS 300 is a real kick to drive, something that can’t be said of your father’s Lexus. After all, most “Lexi” go for comfort and luxury over pure handling prowess, so while the cars are wonders of sophistication, refinement and isolation, they do little to stir the soul.\n\nConsider the IS 300 a soul stirrer.\n\nThis little (176.6 inches, slightly bigger than a Corolla) Lexus is a rear-drive car that aims to challenge its German and Japanese rivals (Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, Mercedes Benz C-Class, Infiniti I30 and Acura TL) as well as its American ones (Cadillac Catera and Lincoln LS). This it does with a healthy dose of performance. In this case, the performance is courtesy of the Lexus GS 300 whose 3-liter inline six-cylinder engine is shared by the IS 300.\n\nThe engine is blessed with 215 horsepower and 218 foot pounds of torque at 3,800 rpm. Hooked to a five-speed automatic transmission, the car reaches 60 mph in a tic over 7 seconds. (A five-speed manual is coming for 2002.)\n\nNeedless to say, power is impressive. Huge P215/45R17-sized tires put the power to the pavement in a true neck-snapping manner. Power is available throughout the rev range and a huge singular exhaust tip makes beautiful music as you cruise into ticket-getting speeds.\n\nThe five-speed transmission ticks off the shifts smoothly, and the F1-style steering-wheel-mounted shifter buttons help take some of the sting out of the automatic, but it’s still no replacement for a manual trans.\n\nThe power feels fierce, but the somewhat numb, although quick, power steering takes this little beauty exactly where its pointed. Braking is as impressive as the power, with four-wheel-disc brakes and anti-lock providing for extremely short stopping distances with little nose-dive.\n\nRide is different from other Lexi in that it absorbs bumps, but you’ll actually still notice them. Road noise is louder than you might expect. Cornering is relatively flat.\n\nStill, this is a Lexus, so despite its super performance capabilities, it’s equally at home playing the part of mild-mannered sedan for a great international car company.\n\nThanks to the details, the IS 300 was sharp enough to turn heads, despite the Clark Kent body shell. Up front, a tough-looking grille and high-intensity gas-discharge headlamps give the car an early 21st century appearance, while out back tail lamps derived from the GS 300 give the car a family resembla nce. Aluminum wheels help the car look muscular.\n\nBut the true distinction is inside, where the car has a few touches that make it stand apart from the rest of the Lexus line.\n\nThe dash has no wood trim, instead, it’s decorated with a titanium-finished plastic. The gauges are cleverly styled to resemble a chronograph watch. They’re different and take some getting used to.\n\nSimple touches help accent the theme, whether it’s the rugged-looking climate control knobs or the chrome-wrapped knob-topped shifter. The seats are covered in a combination of suede and leather that are hard, but supportive. The scuff plates on the door and pedals have a chrome finish as well. This is one interior that’s as stylish as they come. Yet it’s never a case of style over function. Don’t expect a lot in the way of power amenities, aside from the usual power locks/windows/mirrors. This car is about power and handling as much as luxury. Still, the lack of amenities is a disappo tment in a car approaching the $35,000 mark.\n\nBut there’s nothing disappointing about its performance. This car has a powerful, rip-snorting powerplant and stylish interior that takes on its competitors with overwhelming super power and panache. Just like you wouldn’t expect a super hero to have read Emily Post, this car is lacking on a couple of the smaller points.\n\nJust beware of the power hiding behind the IS 300.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe latest IS enters its fourth model year with carryover drivetrains but a number of styling tweaks that aim to keep things fresh against a host of luxury sport sedans from Europe, Detroit and Japan.\n\nThe 2017 IS goes on sale this fall.\n\nExteriorThe revised sedan wears updated headlights, which sport a flatter appearance than last year’s wavier design. Below them, the bumper forms a single piece with large new vertical air intakes instead of the layered horizontal intakes that characterized the 2014-2016 IS. Lexus’ hourglass-shaped “spindle” grille narrows a little higher than it did before, with new horizontal inserts top to bottom. Around back, Lexus rejiggered the taillight reflectors and reshaped the tailpipes, but the overall look carries over.\n\nAs before, the IS will offer an F-Sport version with more-aggressive styling, including a mesh grille with functional brake ducts around the lower sides, plus matching dark garnishes on the vertical air intakes that flank them.\n\nInteriorChanges inside are relatively minor. The IS’ multimedia screen grows to 10.3 inches from its previous 7 inches. Lexus’ available Remote Touch Interface, a knob-based controller on the center console, gets some new buttons to aid usability. Ahead of it, the climate and stereo controls are a little more sunken now to fit between the IS’ knee bolsters.\n\nUnder the HoodUpdated for the 2016 model year, the IS’ engines carry over for 2017. The IS 200t gets a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the IS 300 and IS 350 have a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 255 hp (IS 300) or 306 hp (IS 350).\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard on the IS 200t and IS 350. All-wheel drive is unavailable on the IS 200t, standard on the IS 300 and optional on the IS 350. Rear-drive cars employ an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nSafetyThe IS will get Lexus’ Safety System Plus as standard equipment. That includes a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, as well as a lane departure warning system with steering assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights.",

      "expert_review": "After a full redesign for 2021 and a V-8-powered 500 F Sport Performance introduced for 2022, the Lexus IS compact sports sedan rolls into 2023 with familiar powertrains, performance specs and tech features. Minor updates include limited-run appearance packages for the 350 and 500 F Sport, a new F Sport Design option and Handling Package for the 350 F Sport, and a modest price bump across the board.\nRelated: 2021 Lexus IS 350 Review: Refocused but Not Rejuvenated\nWhat’s New?\nThe updates for the 2023 IS are mainly aesthetic. The Special Appearance Package for the 480-unit 350 F Sport features Incognito paint accents, a black hood and roof, and 19-inch Enkei alloy wheels; on the 150-unit 500 F Sport Premium, it includes Molten Pearl exterior paint, black synthetic leather seats and 19-inch matte-black forged-alloy wheels. The latter is now available as an option on all 500 F Sports.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2023 Lexus IS | Manufacturer image\n  \n\n  \n    The new 350 F Sport Design variant comes with exterior F Sport styling cues including a trim-specific grille, bumpers, rear spoiler, 19-inch wheels and badging. A new Handling Package adds an adaptive variable suspension, Torsen limited-slip rear differential for rear-wheel-drive variants, and Drive Mode Select with Sport S/S Plus and Custom modes.\nPowertrains\nFour powertrain options are again available for the IS. The base 300’s 241-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission on RWD models; the all-wheel-drive 300 swaps the four-cylinder for a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with a six-speed automatic. The 350 F Sport splits the difference between the 300 and 500 with a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 311 hp; RWD models get an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD versions employ the six-speed automatic. And under the hood of the RWD-only 500 F Sport Performance is a 5.0-liter V-8 making 472 hp and mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.\nTech, Safety and Standard Features\nStandard features inside all IS models include Lexus’ NuLuxe synthetic leather seats (heated front seats come standard with AWD), dual-zone automatic climate control and an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa integration. A larger 10.3-inch screen is available with the Navigation Package, and you can add Mark Levinson 17-speaker premium audio atop that. The base 300 rides on 18-inch wheels and gets standard LED headlights, taillights and daytime running lights.\nA suite of safety and driver-assist features can be found across the IS lineup as part of Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5: Forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian and bicyclist detection, lane departure steering assist and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go come standard.\nF Sport Appointments\nF Sport models add a heated and leather-trimmed steering wheel, bolstered heated and ventilated front seats, unique interior trim with black geometric design, and perforated synthetic leather upholstery. The 500 F Sport Performance adds black logos on the steering wheel and doors, F Sport startup animation and a 360-degree camera system for the Premium variant. Exterior cues include trim-specific front and rear bumpers, grille surround, rear spoiler and exhaust tips, and larger 19-inch wheels, while the 500 F Sport Performance adds a raised hood, quad exhaust system, unique badging, a power moonroof and 19-inch alloy wheels.\nTrims, Pricing and Release Date\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2023 Lexus IS | Manufacturer image\n  \n\n  \n    The 2023 Lexus IS is on sale now with a starting price of $40,585 for the base 300 (all prices include a $1,150 destination charge); AWD adds $2,000 to the 300 and 350 F Sport. All returning models see prices creep up $270-$310 over model-year 2022.\n\n300: $40,585 (up $310)\n350 F Sport Design: $43,660\n350 F Sport: $44,910 (up $210)\n500 F Sport: $58,270 (up $270)\n500 F Sport Premium: $62,770 (up $270)\n\nVersus the Competition\nThe Lexus IS competes among luxury compact sport sedans including the Acura TLX, BMW 3 Series and Genesis G70 — and like the IS, each of these rivals offers a higher-performance variant. The 2022 TLX starts at $39,995 and $54,795 for the performance-oriented Type S; the 2023 3 Series starts at $43,295 and $55,765 for the M340i; and the 2023 Genesis G70 starts at $40,245 for the base trim and $45,745 for the 3.3T.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus IS 500 F Sport Performance: Get Your V-8 While You Can\n2021 Lexus IS: 6 Things We Like and 4 Things We Don’t\n2022 Lexus ES 350 Review: Now More Reasons to Buy\nWhat’s New With Lexus for 2022?\nResearch the Lexus IS\n\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Lexus’ popular mid-size ES and compact IS sedans enter the 2022 model year with some updates: The ES finally adds a touchscreen display and the hybrid ES 300h gets an F Sport package, while the IS (which got most of its major updates for 2021) adds a few minor option packages and content … and a honkin’ 5.0-liter V-8 in the new IS 500 F Sport Performance, the closest we’re probably going to get to the return of the IS F. Lexus has now released pricing information for the sedans, and in a slightly unusual turn of events, not all of the updated, newer-model-year cars will cost more than their predecessors.\n\nRelated: Updated 2022 Lexus ES Addresses One of Its Greatest Misses\n\nThe ES will likely cost slightly more (except for the ES 300h), while the IS will cost slightly less, except for the IS 500’s hefty premium over the more pedestrian IS 300 and 350. All pricing below includes a $1,075 destination fee.\n\n2022 Lexus ES Pricing\n\nThe 2022 ES can be had in base, Luxury, Ultra Luxury or F Sport guise. The Luxury trim adds $5,400 to the price, while the Ultra Luxury raises the price by $9,180 from the base, regardless of model. The F Sport differs slightly: For the ES 300h, it’s an extra $3,550, while for the ES 300 and ES 250 AWD, it’s an additional $4,650.\n\nES 350: $41,875 ($800 increase)\nES 250 AWD: $41,875 ($800 increase)\nES 300h: $42,975 ($10 decrease)\n2022 Lexus IS Pricing\n2022 Lexus IS 500 F Sport Performance | Manufacturer image\n\nThe trim structure for the IS is slightly simpler. The IS 300 is available with rear- or all-wheel drive, while the more powerful IS 350 is available exclusively as an F Sport model, again with either RWD or AWD. Upgrading to AWD is an extra $2,000. The IS 500 F Sport Performance, meanwhile, is solely RWD and available in base, Premium or Launch Edition versions. The Premium is an extra $4,500, while the Launch Edition is another $6,400 on top of that.\n\nIS 300 RWD: $39,700 ($425 decrease)\nIS 350 F Sport RWD: $44,125 ($100 decrease)\nIS 500 F Sport Performance RWD: $57,575\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus IS 500 F Sport Performance: Get Your V-8 While You Can\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Lexus IS 350?\nHere Are 5 Great Affordable Luxury Cars You Can Buy Right Now\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2021?\n2021 Lexus IS: 6 Things We Like and 4 Things We Don’t\nRelease Date\n\nThe 2022 Lexus ES lineup is expected to arrive at dealerships in October, while the IS lineup has a less precise expected arrival date of “later this fall.”\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: [Deep breath] Acura TLX, Alfa Romeo Giulia, Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac CT4, Genesis G70, Infiniti Q50, Jaguar XE, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Americans’ desire to buy an SUV\n\nLooks like: The old IS hit the gym (and maybe the plastic surgeon, too)\n\nPowertrain: 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (rear-wheel drive), 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (all-wheel drive) or 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (IS 350); eight-speed automatic (RWD) or six-speed automatic (AWD)\n\nHits dealerships: Late fall\n\nLexus virtually has debuted the latest generation of its IS compact sports sedan, showing off a longer and wider look that is sporty and muscular, crucial in a class where nearly every competing manufacturer touts its model’s driving fun factor. The IS’ updated interior, meanwhile, tries to keep pace in the rapidly accelerating technology battle.\n\nRelated: 2021 Lexus IS Reveal Moves to Monday\n\nChanges take place under the skin, as well, with Lexus adding stiffness to the IS’ chassis while also reducing weight. The IS also offers 19-inch wheels for the first time in its history. Where changes haven’t taken place, however, is with the sedan’s available drivetrains: Both the IS 300 and IS 350 offer the same engine and transmission choices as the previous generation. Lexus has also simplified the IS lineup somewhat by limiting the F Sport model to the more-powerful IS 350 trim.\n\nExterior\n\nIn front, the 2021 IS gets a new version of Lexus’ now-familiar spindle grille, with F Sport and regular models wearing different designs. F Sport models also get an air intake at the bottom of the grille to improve brake cooling. New, slimmer headlights give the IS a more aggressive face. Along the sides, the IS has a sculpted look with new rocker panels that lead up into the muscular rear quarter panels. A sculpted rear deck lid gives the illusion of an even wider and more imposing stance, and new L-shaped LED taillights span the rear. \n\nStandard wheels are 18 inches in diameter, up from the previous 17-inchers. F Sport models offer a choice of two 19-inch wheel options, including lightweight BBS wheels in the optional Dynamic Handling Package. Lexus says these 19-inch wheels “improve cornering force and provide a greater contact patch with the road.” F Sport models with the Dynamic Handling Package also get a carbon-fiber rear spoiler and matching mirror caps.\n\nInterior\n\nWe’ve long lamented the Lexus Remote Touchpad infotainment system, and the first ray of light for a change came with the refresh of the popular RX SUV for the 2020 model year, which finally has a touchscreen. Now, it’s in the IS as well. Shoppers can choose between an 8- or 10.3-inch touchscreen, the latter coming with optional in-car navigation with or without the premium Mark Levinson stereo. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa connectivity are all standard.\n\nF Sport models gain standard leather-upholstered front sport seats and a leather-wrapped and heated steering wheel, as well as a specific gauge cluster and pedals.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nThe new IS uses the previous model’s engine and transmission options. Rear-wheel-drive IS 300 models are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 241 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque, paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Opt for all-wheel drive and you get a 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 260 hp and 236 pounds-feet, paired to a six-speed automatic. The more powerful IS 350 uses a 3.5-liter V-6 pumping out 311 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque. RWD models get the eight-speed auto and AWD models the six-speed.\n\nLexus says the IS 350 with RWD will go from 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds; the AWD model hits the mark in 5.7 seconds.\n\nF Sport models with the Dynamic Handling Package get an adaptive suspension to adjust suspension stiffness, and Lexus says that suspension has been tuned to improve performance for 2021.\n\nSafety\n\nFor 2021, the IS gets version 2.5 of Lexus’ Safety System Plus suite of safety technologies as standard equipment. The precollision component includes emergency steering assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, and Lexus says it can now detect the vehicle ahead and preceding cyclists in daylight situations, plus preceding pedestrians in both daylight and low-light situations. Lexus also says it does a better job of detecting and responding to potential collisions when making a left turn across traffic.\n\nThe included adaptive cruise control system works to a stop and now does a better job of overtaking a slower vehicle. Lane departure warning with lane-centering steering is also included, as are automatic high-beam headlights and a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nNo Pricing or Gas Mileage Info\n\nWhat we don’t know yet are how the 2021 IS 300 and IS 350’s fuel economy figures will compare to those either of the previous generation — 2020 AWD models offered EPA combined ratings of 21 mpg, while the RWD IS 350 was rated at 23 mpg and the RWD IS 300 at 24 mpg — or the competition. We’re also still waiting on pricing information, though expect it to cost more than the outgoing model. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

An IS 300 SportCross body style joined the original IS 300 sedan later that season. In 2002, Lexus added a manual-shift sedan that targeted drivers who werent satisfied with the original automatic transmission.\n    All versions of the IS 300 use the same 215-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. For the 2004 model year, each gets a two-position memory feature for the drivers seat, a maintenance indicator light and automatic door locking/unlocking. New 11-spoke wheels are optional.\n   Exterior Slanted rear roof pillars give the IS 300 a semi-fastback profile. The chiseled-look body has short front and rear overhangs. Back-end styling resembles that of the larger Lexus GS 300 and GS 430 models. This year, smoked gray light surrounds go on the IS 300s headlights, taillights and fog lamps.\n   The IS 300 is mounted on a 105.1-inch wheelbase. It measures 176.6 inches long overall and is 14.5 inches shorter than the front-wheel-drive Lexus ES 330 sedan. Standard alloy wheels and tires are 17 inches in diameter, and 16-inchers are optional.\n   Interior Few automobiles have a more distinctive dashboard than the IS 300s, but its fashionable style could get in the way of utility. Lexus says the chronograph-style instrument cluster was inspired by sport watches. Three small gauges are positioned within a large speedometer, but those tiny dials are difficult to read. A separate tachometer sits to their left.\n   Standard equipment includes automatic climate control, heated outside mirrors, remote keyless entry, and a stereo system with cassette and six-CD players. The IS 300 seats five people, but the driveline tunnel divides the three-place rear seat. A pass-thru section from the rear seat augments the trunks 10.1-cubic-foot cargo capacity.\n   Under the Hood Lexus borrowed the 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine from its larger GS 300 sedan, but the IS 300s version is rated at a lower 215 hp. The E-Shift five-speed-automatic transmission has steering-wheel controls that permit manually selected gear changes when desired. A five-speed-manual transmission is also available.\n   Safety Side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain-type airbags, antilock brakes and traction control are standard. Lexus Vehicle Skid Control electronic stability system is optional on sedans equipped with the automatic transmission.\n  Driving Impressions Lexus did it right by creating a sporty sedan that delivers on its promise of athletic behavior and invigorating action. The IS 300 strives to satisfy enthusiastic drivers who can appreciate a taut suspension and a rear-drive layout with curve-hugging capabilities. When pushing hard on the gas pedal, the IS 300 is prepared to respond with a level of energy that can come as a surprise. Better yet, the sedans athletic maneuvers arent accompanied by a decline in ride comfort.\n  The IS 300 is well behaved in ordinary driving and is ready to be pushed. The E-Shift automatic transmission operates easily and effectively. Flicking neatly between gears, the manual gearbox is one of the easier-to-operate units, compared to manual transmissions in rival models.\n   Except for the instrument layout, theres not much to distract the driver from an enjoyable experience.  \n \n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;Posted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "As the ad so proudly claims, Lexus has always meant luxury. But has it ever meant utility?\n\nWe doubt it.\n\nCan you imagine: “Need extra space to haul that sheet of lumber? See your Lexus dealer.”\n\nOr, perhaps, there’s the more painful: “Not sure how you’ll haul home cement bags, a bar fridge and two kids? Think: Lexus.”\n\nActually, for a change, do think Lexus. Twenty-two cubic feet of cargo space will at least get you to consider the company that once turned Toyota into soft taupe leather interiors. The 2002 IS300 SportCross will get you to consider Lexus when you want a blend of sedan styling and wagon utility that’s so much more than just the lap of luxury.\n\nAnd that’s a stretch.\n\nThe new version of the BMW-like Lexus IS300 is so un-Lexus it actually rolls in with a tailgate, fold-down rear seatbacks, power outlets and a rear cargo area mounted with a woofer. Uh, are we talking Lexus or Jeep Liberty?\n\nMaybe both. Lexus claims its IS300 SportCross is literally what the name implies. It’s a cross between faux wood and hauling wood. Actually, the automaker says it’s more of an apparent necessity. Lexus has convinced itself the IS300 is a prerequisite for the “active young buyers” the company covets. In that way it fits. In some ways, it’s further proof that cross-pollination in the car industry may never end.\n\nTo that end, the SportCross is the perfect hybrid.\n\nBuilt on the same platform as the IS300 sedan, the SportCross has the same, jackrabbit 215-horsepower 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine and, in many ways, is a carbon rip-off (mechanically) of the sedan, except for the gain in length in height.\n\nIt has the same smooth transmission – a five-speed automatic – that uses Lexus’ E-Shift manumatic, allowing you to shift by using buttons on the steering wheel (no manual is offered). And it has the same attractive, multi-gauge, Swiss Army instrument cluster that makes the Lexus the talk of the town from an aesthetics perspective.\n\nBut the small differences might set the SportCross apart. There is some clever stuff here. Look inside the SportCross and you’ll find a front passenger seat that folds all the way flat, a “false floor” in the cargo area for valuables and a tonneau cover to cover up what’s important. The folding passenger seat has a seatback table, good for tailgating, and nine speakers to pump up the volume.\n\nMostly, there’s space. Drop the rear seats and the SportCross can hold a large sheet of plywood or a family-sized set of luggage.\n\nInside, extras are minimal; nearly everything is standard. The SportCross comes loaded with features, including power windows and door locks, keyless entry, cruise control, climate control, front side-curtain airbags, traction control, anti-lock brakes and Brake Assist.\n\nOutside, it is standard Lexus stuff. With a short wheelbase, quick steering, low-profile tires and control-arm suspension, the IS300 is a nimble, playful, balanced ride. It’s fun in the hills and around the corners. And when’s the last time you could say that about your average wagon?\n\nBut there are also flaws. The SportCross isn’t just a blend of cargo and cachet, it’s also more Toyota than it is Lexus – more road noise than you expect and plenty of thin materials. And that’s where the $32,850 price tag comes into play.\n\nFor 30 grand, you are getting Lexus technology, but not all the soft touches. Front and rear seats are firm and supportive, but aggressive tires and a lack of sound-deadening materials make this less the rich ride we’ve come to expect. Which makes you wonder whether you are merely paying for the name or the whole package.\n\nCompared with other wagons, the SportCross is less than a Saab 9-5 and Audi Allroad Quattro, but more than a Volvo V70 and BMW 3-Series. Its gasoline mileage (18 mpg city/25 mpg highway) also is middle-of-the-road compared with its competitors. Safety, with its standard curtain side airbags, m this a solid and confident car and a warranty, that goes four years/50,000 miles on the basic and six years/70,000 miles on the powertrain, is one of the best.\n\nBut rear-seat room is a little tighter than you might expect for a ride this size. Two adults is the practical limit and small doors make entering and exiting the vehicle a narrow squeeze.\n\nThe IS300 might not be the most substantial, most dynamic, largest wagon on the block, it is still sporty driving in Lexus style.\n\nAnd that’s an awfully large load.\n\nSPECS\n\n2002 Lexus IS 300 SportCross\n\nRating: 3\n\nHigh gear: Acceleration, performance and the rare combination of speed and size make the IS 300 a sporty driving wagon with some Lexus style.\n\nLow gear: Rear-seat room is at a premium, and the IS 300 lacks some of the interior cachet found in cars that cost less on the lot.\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger sports wagon.\n\nStandard equipment: Five-speed automatic transmission; traction control; dual front airbags; front side airbags; front curtain airbags; antilock four-wheel disc brakes; daytime running lights; air conditioning with climate control; air filter; power steering; tilt leather steering wheel; cruise control; heated power mirrors; power door locks; remote keyless entry; AM/FM/cassette with indash 6-disc player; theft-deterrent system; fog lights.\n\nCompetition: Audi A4 Avant, BMW 3-Series, Volvo V70, Saab 9-5\n\nEngine: 215 horsepower, 3.0-liter in-line 6-cylinder\n\nTorque: 218 foot-lbs. @ 3,800 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches\n\nLength: 177 inches\n\nMPG rating: 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; powertrain warranty is six years/70,000 miles; rust perforation is six years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price: $32,850\n\nPrice as tested (includes options, destination and delivery charges): $32,850",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus IS?\n\nThe Lexus IS is a compact luxury sports sedan that seats up to five people. The rear-wheel-drive IS 300 features a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the all-wheel-drive IS 300 uses a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. \n\nStepping up the IS powertrain ladder, both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the IS 350 come with a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. An eight-speed automatic goes in IS models with rear-wheel drive, while a six-speed automatic goes in all-wheel-drive sedans. Competitors include the Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series. A new IS is scheduled to debut as a 2021 model. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus IS?\n\nA new Black Line Special Edition is available for F Sport versions of the IS. Limited to 900 units, the cosmetic package features black-chrome wheels, a black grille and side mirror covers, plus a black interior with blue and gray accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus IS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include a 7-inch multimedia screen, a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, two USB ports, simulated leather seating surfaces and satellite radio. Standard safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high-beam headlights and adaptive cruise control. \n\nAvailable features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, a power rear sunshade, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, built-in navigation with a 10.3-inch screen, and a Mark Levinson audio system. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus IS?\n\nThe IS is a comfortable compact luxury car with good backseat space. It’s too bad its driving experience lacks the fun-to-drive feeling offered by the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Genesis G70 and others. There are also some cheap-looking trim pieces in the cabin, and the Remote Touch interface remains extremely frustrating.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus IS?\n\nThe Lexus IS is a compact luxury sports sedan that seats up to five people. The rear-wheel-drive IS 300 features a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the all-wheel-drive IS 300 uses a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the IS 350, meanwhile, are powered by a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Competitors include the Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Lexus IS?\n\nLexus says it's retuned the rear-drive IS 300's turbo four-cylinder drivetrain for better throttle response, transmission performance and turbocharger response. Triple-beam LED headlights are optional.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus IS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include LED daytime running lights, a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a 60/40-split folding backseat. Standard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, and adaptive cruise control.\n\nAvailable features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, a power rear sunshade, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, built-in navigation with a 10.3-inch screen and a Mark Levinson premium stereo.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus IS?\n\nThe IS offers a relatively comfortable ride and good backseat legroom, but the driving experience doesn't deliver enough driver involvement for a sports sedan. We also think some of the trim in the cabin looks too cheap for a luxury car, and we aren't fans of Lexus' Remote Touch multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus IS?\n\nThe Lexus IS is a compact luxury sports sedan that seats up to five people. The rear-wheel-drive IS 300 features a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the all-wheel-drive IS 300 uses a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Both the RWD and AWD versions of the IS 350 come with a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The high-performance, range-topping IS 500 is only available with RWD and is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. Rear-drive IS models get an eight-speed automatic, while AWD cars are fitted with a six-speed automatic. The IS’ competitors include the Alfa Romeo Giulia, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac CT4, Genesis G70 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus IS?\n\nSelect IS trims get more standard equipment for 2025, and the IS 500 gains a couple of limited-production special editions: A Special Appearance Package celebrating the IS’ 25th anniversary is limited to 180 units, and an Ultimate Edition is limited to 500 examples. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus IS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nKeyless entry and start\nSynthetic leather seats\nPower-adjustable front seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n8-inch touchscreen\n10-speaker sound system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nMoonroof\nAdaptive shock absorbers\nLimited-slip differential\nHeated front seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.3-inch touchscreen with navigation\n17-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\n360-degree parking camera system\nPower rear-window sunshade\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus IS?\n\nDespite some astute updates, including a refresh for the 2021 model year, the IS’ basic design is the oldest in its class. Still, this compact sports sedan is fun and satisfying to hustle down a winding road, and Lexus includes a lot more standard equipment than most of its competitors at a similar price.",
