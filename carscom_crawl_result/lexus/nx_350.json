      "expert_review": "The verdict: A full 2022 redesign for Lexus’ NX compact SUV reintroduces an entry-level powertrain, boosts mileage and acceleration for the available hybrid variant, adds the first Lexus plug-in hybrid (for some markets) and makes the whole NX lineup more competitive in several ways. But none of them are more significant than the eradication of the outgoing generation’s much-hated console touchpad in exchange for a decent touchscreen.\n\nVersus the competition: Much improved over its former self, the 2022 NX is now competitive with luxury SUVs in its class, though it doesn’t leapfrog them.\n\nLexus can be credited with fielding the first great crossover in the U.S. market, the 1999 RX 300, and faulted for not following it up with a smaller sibling until 2015, even as virtually every brand — luxury and mass-market — benchmarked the RX and filled the roads with competitors of every conceivable size. Unfortunately, when the NX finally did arrive, we thought it had too many faults among too many strong competitors. In our most recent class comparison test, the 2018 NX took last place.\n\nThe 2022 redesign is a complete one, with a change of platform and a chance for Lexus to address the model’s shortcomings. Did the brand succeed? After a busy day driving three of the four available powertrains in and around Phoenix at a Lexus launch event, I believe the answer is a qualified yes. (Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging at such automaker-sponsored drive programs.)\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus NX Is Redesigned to Plug-In ‘N Play\n\nThough the 2022’s launch has been delayed by the microchip crisis, Lexus expects all powertrains, each with its own model suffix, to arrive at dealerships in December. They include the front- or all-wheel-drive NX 250 (2.5-liter four-cylinder) and three variations with standard AWD: the NX 350 (a new turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder), the NX 350h hybrid and the first Lexus plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the NX 450h Plus. Each drivetrain has a towing capacity of 2,000 pounds when equipped with an optional towing package, a modest amount in this class. Trim levels include base, Premium, Luxury and F Sport, and depend on the powertrain. By comparison, the 2021 model year had only two powertrains: an NX 300, which took over for the 200t in 2018, and the NX 300h, which survived the whole run since 2015 to comprise 23% of sales, according to Lexus.\n\nThe Wicked Switch Is Dead\n\nThere’s no news about the NX as relevant as the elimination of Lexus’ much-hated Remote Touch Interface, a touchpad on the center console that countless consumers have deemed a deal breaker. We’ve struggled to overcome it every time we’ve evaluated a Lexus — be it for review, during annual awards deliberation or in a multivehicle Challenge like the one the 2018 NX 300 lost. This interface, paired with a display high on the dashboard, was cited as a major strike against the earlier generation in that contest. Remote Touch’s staying power is about cultural differences: Japanese consumers, we’re told, prefer their screen high and forward where it’s too far to serve as a touchscreen, and they don’t care for fingerprint-smudged displays. They have a point, but Remote Touch was a medicine worse than the disease, in our eyes.\n\nIn the old system’s place, the 2022 NX has a standard 9.8-inch touchscreen or an optional — and enormous — 14-inch one, designed here in the U.S. for global distribution (except Japan). All vehicles present had the larger screen, but Lexus says the smaller one shares its functionality, along with a physical volume knob (an item too many automakers now delete, aggravatingly). The system works reasonably well; I think the menus could be a little better thought out, and it cries out for a physical home button off the screen, especially for getting out of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay without multiple steps. And a few more physical buttons wouldn’t hurt for people who don’t like touchscreen overload, though I don’t mind it. But this doesn’t need to win any award to be a win for Lexus shoppers, it just has to ditch the remote touchpad and include (as it does) CarPlay and Android Auto, both wired and wireless, as standard equipment.\n\nThese might seem like minor things, but the presence of one and lack of the others definitely hurt Lexus for years. I’ll return to these features, but hey, this is a car review. Let’s drive.\n\nBehind the Wheel: Three 2022 NX Models Tested\n\nOne of our objections to the previous NX generation was that it rode firmly and busily without any real payoff in handling. We also dinged the 2018 NX 300 for being pokier than its competitors, with a Cars.com-tested 0-60 mph time of 7.3 seconds (worst in the group) and notably modest passing power even though the engine and transmission worked well together. For 2022, the NX rides a new platform and enjoys a 1.2-inch wheelbase increase and a wider track — the distance between left and right wheels — by 1 inch in front and 1.8 inches in back.\n\nCars.com photo by Melissa Klauda\n\nNote that my test vehicles were all the Luxury trim level for a clean comparison, priced as equipped between $53,840 and $59,020. This means they had 20-inch wheels in place of standard 18s, whose taller tire sidewalls might have provided more cushioning. They also had the standard suspension rather than the unique setup in the F Sport trim level offered on the NX 350 and NX 450h Plus (also available combined with the Luxury trim in the latter). The F Sport option cuts two ways: It has an adaptive suspension with electronically controlled shock absorber firmness, a technology that can theoretically make a vehicle either comfortable or sporty to suit the driver. But in our experience, Lexus F Sport vehicles always ride more firmly regardless.\n\nNX 350 Luxury AWD\n\nThe longer wheelbase and wider track might not seem like dramatic changes, but the NX 350 Luxury I drove had better ride quality than its forebear, and the handling is both better and certainly good enough, even in the Luxury trim. Lexus is among many brands that chased sportiness for years when it probably would have satisfied customers even more by emphasizing ride comfort, especially in SUVs.\n\nThe new 2022 NX 350 replaces the outgoing NX 300’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a turbo 2.4-liter four rated at 275 horsepower and 317 pounds-feet of torque — up 40 hp and 59 pounds-feet of torque in a vehicle that weighs 15 pounds less with standard AWD. The result is predictably good, mostly.\n\nJust so we’re comparing apples to apples, the AWD 2021 NX 300 is closing out its days with a claimed 0-60 mph time of 7.0 seconds (lower than our measured 7.3 seconds from 2018). Lexus says the new NX 350 hits 60 mph in 6.6 seconds; that’s an improvement over the 300, though it’s still short (by quite a bit, in some cases) of manufacturer-estimated times for the base drivetrains and slowest versions of the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nThe 350 launches definitively off the line, and its eight-speed automatic transmission is mostly well behaved. One exception was some delay I detected when stomping on the pedal to pass, which at some speeds induced lag of a full second or more. As disappointing as this may be, it’s more common than you’d think among new vehicles, and it’s always worth looking for.\n\nNX 350h Luxury AWD\n\nLike its predecessor, the NX 300h, the new NX 350h combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two motor-generators and a battery pack, the classic Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive/Lexus Hybrid Drive (Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand), and adds a third electric motor on the rear axle to enable standard AWD.\n\nI think this version rides smoother and more composed than the non-hybrid. I can’t say there’s a good reason because it weighs only 45 pounds more, but sometimes the different weight or weight distribution in a hybrid — or the way suspensions are tuned to account for it — can make a noticeable difference. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised; we prefer the hybrid version of the current Toyota RAV4 over the regular one, and this Lexus shares a great deal with that model.\n\nThis generation’s total system power is 239 hp, versus 194 hp for the NX 300h. The acceleration is more than adequate, especially for a hybrid, but it does have the familiar hybrid feel, with some rubber-band effect, whereby you press the accelerator and it takes a moment or two for the powertrain to catch up to your full intentions — though not the momentary complete lack of passing response I mentioned about the NX 350. The brakes also have the characteristic hybrid regenerative-braking feel, which is to say a bit mushy compared with the best conventional brakes. But this and the somewhat wonky acceleration are typically ignored or accepted in exchange for high mileage.\n\nLexus cites its 0-60 mph time as 7.2 seconds, which is slower than the NX 350, though quicker than the NX 250 (8.2 to 8.6 seconds depending on driveline, according to Lexus). But it’s also considerably quicker than the 2021 NX 300h despite rating an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined, an 8 mpg improvement. It’s hard to beat that, as is the fact that the NX 350h is priced $500 lower to start than the non-hybrid NX 350 at $42,125 (all prices include destination charge). Less thrilling is that the 350h now has a minimum gasoline octane requirement of 91 like the NX 350 and 450h Plus rather than 87 octane in the previous hybrid and new NX 250.\n\nNX 450h Plus Luxury AWD\n\nLexus’ first plug-in hybrid, the NX 450h Plus, is equipped similarly to the 350h but has a much larger battery pack and operates at higher voltage with 302 total hp. It has an EPA-estimated range of 36 miles on electric power, after which it operates as a hybrid at 36 mpg combined, according to Lexus. I wasn’t able to sample its all-electric acceleration because the battery pack had been depleted by my rotation in the car. In hybrid mode, the 450h Plus might have been my favorite powertrain. For one thing, it’s the quickest of them all, with a 0-60 time of 6.0 seconds (albeit still comparatively modest in this class), per Lexus. But more important, its added electric power helps eliminate hesitation of all types — both the passing delay in the NX 350 and the rubber-band effect in the NX 350h.\n\nThe ride quality is also pretty good, but there’s a handling give and take to the vehicle’s added weight — almost 400 pounds more than the NX 350h: It seems to lower the center of gravity and quell body roll in turns, but it compromises roadholding (as weight always does).\n\nHad there been time and adequate Level 2 charging, Lexus says, we could have recharged the 450h Plus fully in 2.5 to 4.5 hours, depending on equipment. The standard onboard charger is rated 3.3 kilowatts, but an optional Expedited Onboard Charger boosts it to 6.6 kW. These translate to roughly 8-14.4 miles of range per hour of charging, respectively. (Given that a household 120-volt outlet can provide about 1.5 kW, depending on the charger, you could get by with Level 1 for overnight charging, but it wouldn’t be adequate for preheating or -cooling the cabin in extreme temperatures to preserve your electric range.)\n\nSo, the powertrain is my favorite and the ride is good. Is this my favorite version? Well, it is more expensive — $56,635 to start — though it should be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 if you can front the money. The problem is that the NX 450h Plus will probably prove difficult to get. It’s essentially Lexus’ version of the Toyota RAV4 Prime, which itself was hard enough to come by before the effects of the pandemic and microchip shortage were fully felt. Lexus will prioritize California and other zero-emissions-vehicle states like in the Northeast, and I suspect it will be just as difficult to get there as elsewhere. Your best chance, if you’re interested, is to get your order in now.\n\nThe Cargo Shuffle\n\nAnother strike against the 2018 NX 300 in our seven-model comparison test was its cargo space, including its height. What’s happened with the 2022 redesign is … difficult to judge. The previous generation offered a claimed 17.7 cubic feet behind the backseat and 54.6 cubic feet with the seats folded; the 2022 NX’s cargo area is specified as 22.7/46.9 cubic feet, so it grew behind the backseat but shrank overall by Lexus’ numbers. But that may not be the whole story, because these methods don’t always account for underfloor space, and with the elimination of the spare tire in favor of run-flats, there are several very roomy bins in the back of the NX 350. Even the two hybrids — which take up different amounts of this room with their added equipment, including the 12-volt battery relocated from under the hood — still have usable bins below grade.\n\nDue to inconsistent methodology between automakers, and sometimes within the same automaker, we conduct our own independent cargo measurements. We don’t do so on the road, however, and will have to wait until we get a 2022 NX at home and can compare it with a 2021. We look forward to working up at least one of these vehicles back at Cars.com HQ, but it seems like the specs might be lying to us — and underselling the cargo space.\n\nThe Interior\n\nBy the numbers, the 2022 NX lost 1.8 inches of front-seat legroom versus the prior generation, but at 41 inches, it’s in the right range for the class, and at 6 feet tall, I had no complaints after a full day of driving the Luxury trim level. I didn’t sample the F Sport, which has more aggressively bolstered sport seats with NuLuxe imitation leather along with a distinct steering wheel, new gauges and aluminum pedals and scuff plates.\n\nAll vehicles were pre-production, so it’s best not to draw final conclusions on the interior quality, but overall it seemed good for the class and there are more interesting color choices than Lexus gets enough credit for, including creams and reds. I like open-pore wood trim, but in my NX 450h Plus, which lacked the Mark Levinson audio option that otherwise would take up some of the space, the expansive wood applique on the front door panel looked a bit excessive.\n\nAs for the backseat, it’s another area our judges marked down in 2018, citing that generation’s “tight head, hip, knee and shoulder room,” and singling out its lack of a panoramic moonroof.  The 2022 NX offers the panoramic roof and seems roomier. I found it quite comfortable back there; if anything, it’s a bit narrower than some models, which comes into play only with three passengers or multiple child-safety seats.\n\nAll the Other Tech\n\nThe best thing I can say about the technology is that it mostly serves the driver and passengers well.\n\nAlong with the new touchscreens, the vehicle is notably devoid of touch-sensitive controls, which we loathe. The only exception is the buttons on the steering-wheel spokes if you option the head-up-display, which are touch-sensitive only for the purpose of showing you on the display what your next press will execute. Actually pressing the button still has a mechanical action.\nThe Digital Key option lets you use a smartphone as a key. It’s convenient for the owner but even more so when sharing with up to seven “guests,” so long as Lexus Remote Connect services are active. Combined with the Advanced Park feature on the NX 350h and 450h Plus, it also lets you move the vehicle from outside via the smartphone app.\nThe NX includes Voice Assistant, which I used briefly out of frustration at the lack of a home button. I found it slow to respond when I said, “Hey, Lexus.” Lexus is hardly the first brand to institute this, and I hear there are people who want to control machines with their voices; I am not one of them; speech to text via Android Auto is about my limit. Similarly, Lexus’ new User Profile feature that stores one’s settings in the cloud and will automatically transfer them to other Lexuses (once they add the capability) seems overly ambitious.\nI might feel the same about the Intelligent Assistant, which requires a Drive Connect subscription, because I think people tend to want their weather and other information and services from Apple or Google and are subscriptioned out already.\nTo that end, the NX’s enhanced Cloud Navigation, which requires Drive Connect, might be a bridge too far when CarPlay and Android Auto are built in. I’d have to spend more time to be convinced of its virtues, if any.\nThe high-tech safety features seem more convincing. In addition to the regular collection of active-safety features in the standard Lexus Safety System Plus 3.0 suite, the NX adds a number of turning-related provisions, including emergency steering assist within a lane, as well as a warning system with automatic braking when turning left into oncoming traffic or in either direction in front of a pedestrian or cyclist. The NX’s adaptive cruise control can also manage speed in curves, and it can be used with hands-on lane-centering steering. (The hands-free lane centering now offered by several automakers isn’t in the NX as of yet, though Lexus has a version in the works called Teammate.)\nThe new rearview camera mirror is a nice option for 2022 to account for so-so rear visibility when in motion.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus NX Brings Smart Looks, Smart Tech\nLexus RX: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2021?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Lexus NX 300h?\nShould You Buy a 2022 Lexus NX?\n\nWith a starting price of $39,025 with FWD and $40,625 with AWD, the NX 250 starts off the 2022 lineup just above its predecessor, the 2021 NX 300 FWD ($38,685). The same model with AWD is $40,085, so you’ll understandably pay more for the new and improved 2022 NX 350 ($42,625), which has standard AWD, or the hybrid NX 350h ($42,125). As noted above, the new NX 450h Plus is $56,635 before incentives.\n\nThe NX has become more competitive with its redesign even if it remains modest in size and acceleration versus other models in its class. Being sold alongside the enormously popular RX SUV is a positive, and being the first Lexus in the showroom to do away with the Remote Touch Interface can only help the NX strip away some shoppers.\n\nThe 2022 NX is currently assembled in Japan, but production will begin at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in early 2022.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Following an extensive redesign for 2022, Lexus has announced updated pricing for the 2023 NX compact SUV. Expected to go on sale in late October, it carries over a plethora of tech improvements and powertrain options — but with no changes other than a $255-$405 price bump for 2023 depending on the variant, shoppers can save by going with a 2022 model while it’s still available.\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus NX Review: A Day Late, Not as Short\n\nThe Powertrain Quadrant\n\nThe 2023 NX once again offers a pick of four engine options, with two gas-only models, a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. Gas-only variants are the base NX 250 (203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine) and NX 350 (275-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder). The hybrid NX 350h gets a combined 293-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with two electric-drive motor-generators, and the 450h Plus PHEV is powered by a 302-hp, 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder mated with a lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe NX 250 comes with front- or all-wheel drive; all other variants are AWD-only. The NX 250 is EPA-rated at 28 mpg combined for both FWD and AWD, while combined figures for the rest are 25 mpg for the NX 350, 39 mpg for the 350h and a rating of 84 mpg-e or 36 mpg as a hybrid for the 450h Plus.\n\nTech and Safety\n2022 Lexus NX 450h | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nNotable tech improvements came as part of the NX’s 2022 redesign, but there are no substantive changes for 2023. Gone is the prior generation’s frustrating remote touchpad, as the SUV now employs Lexus’ new multimedia system with voice recognition and a standard 9.8-inch touchscreen or optional 14-inch screen. Other key tech features include standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an optional 10-inch head-up display, available wireless charging, an optional digital rearview mirror and enhanced navigation.\n\nThe Lexus Safety System Plus 3.0 safety suite comes standard and adds advanced features like oncoming vehicle detection, enhanced road-sign assist and dynamic radar cruise control with curve speed management.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2022 Lexus NX 350 F Sport | Manufacturer image\n\nIn addition to the four powertrain variants, the 2023 NX comes in three trim levels: base, Premium and Luxury. The 350 and 450h Plus have an available F Sport Handling Package that adds performance enhancements like an active variable suspension and front and rear performance dampers with trim-specific visual elements. Inside, the F Sport Handling Package adds graphite aluminum details, a unique steering wheel, sport seats and black and red interior trim; the exterior gets a dedicated grille, black roof rails and 20-inch gloss-black wheels.\n\nStarting prices for the 2023 NX are listed below (includes $1,150 destination). The F Sport Handling Package adds $2,050 to the NX 350’s starting price and $1,250 to the 450h Plus’ cost of admission.\n\nNX 250: $39,755 (FWD); $41,355 (AWD)\nNX 350: $43,515\nNX 350 F Sport: $48,615\nNX 350h: $43,105\nNX 450h Plus: $57,705\nNX 450h Plus F Sport: $58,955\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe base NX’s sub-$40,000 starting price undercuts many of its luxury compact SUV rivals, including the 2022 Acura RDX (starting at $43,995), the 2023 Audi Q5 at $44,695 and the 2023 Volvo XC60 at $44,745.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus NX Is Redesigned to Plug-In ‘N Play\n2022 Lexus NX Brings Smart Looks, Smart Tech\nRedesigned 2022 Lexus NX: 5 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\nResearch the Lexus NX\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a compact five-seat luxury SUV with four engine options, including two hybrid variants. The entry-level NX 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic with front- or all-wheel drive; all other NXs are AWD-only. The NX 350 gets a 275-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder that provides considerably stronger acceleration and passing power than the NX 250. The NX 350h hybrid has a four-cylinder that’s paired with two electric motors for a total output of 240 hp. The line-topping NX 450h+ has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that makes 302 hp and provides an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 37 miles. The NX’s competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Genesis GV70 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX receives only minor updates for the 2025 model year, with two new USB-C ports in the center console, a wireless charger, a power liftgate, and front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking now standard across the line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\n10-speaker stereo\nVoice recognition\nDual-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors with automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic roof\nHead-up instrument display\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nSurround-view parking camera\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAmbient interior lighting\nLeather upholstery\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a smooth operator among compact luxury SUVs, though it doesn’t drive quite as sporty as it looks — even in its available F Sport trim. The NX 450h+’s plug-in hybrid powertrain is a rare feature among premium compact SUVs, but it commands an eye-watering price premium over its stablemates. On the opposite end of the model line, we appreciate the NX 250’s relative affordability and nod to fuel economy, though its poky engine seems out of character for a premium vehicle. The NX’s cabin quality is excellent across the board, however, which is something we expect in a Lexus. Space in both the backseat and cargo area are OK, if not exemplary. All in all, the NX delivers what many car shoppers are looking for in a premium SUV, even if it doesn’t stand out in any one way.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with four engine options, including two hybrid models. The entry-level NX 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; all other NXs are AWD-only. The NX 350 gets a 275-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder that provides considerably stronger acceleration and passing power than the NX 250. The NX 350h hybrid has a four-cylinder that’s paired with two electric motors for a total output of 240 hp. The line-topping NX 450h+ has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that makes 302 hp and provides an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 37 miles. The NX’s competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Genesis GV70 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX was redesigned from the ground up for the 2022 model year and receives only minor trim changes and option updates for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\n10-speaker stereo\nVoice recognition\nDual-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nMark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic roof\nHead-up instrument display\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\n360-degree camera system\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAmbient interior lighting\nLeather upholstery\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a smooth operator among luxury compact SUVs, though it doesn’t drive quite as sporty as it looks — even in its available F Sport trim. The NX 450h+’s PHEV powertrain is a rare feature among premium compact SUVs, but it commands an eye-watering price premium over its stablemates. On the opposite end of the model line, we appreciate the NX 250’s relative affordability and nod to fuel economy, though its poky engine seems out of character for a premium vehicle. The NX’s cabin quality is excellent across the board, however, which is something we expect in a Lexus. Space in both the backseat and cargo area are OK, if not exemplary. All in all, the 2024 NX delivers what many car shoppers are looking for in a premium SUV even if it doesn’t stand out in any one way.",
