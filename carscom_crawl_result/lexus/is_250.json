      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat IS 250 sedan and four-seat IS 250C convertible are Lexus’ sporty rivals to the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on the sedan. Competitors include the BMW 128i and 328i, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C300. The more powerful IS 350 plays against beefier versions of those same cars.\n\nThe IS 250 and 250C come with a 2.5-liter V-6; the IS 350 and its 3.5-liter V-6 are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section, as is the V-8-powered IS-F.\n\n(Skip to details on the: IS 250C)\nNew for 2013\nThe IS 250 is no longer offered with a manual transmission, leaving just the six-speed automatic.\n\nA new Special Edition sedan that hits dealerships November 2012 features 17-inch wheels, F Sport front-end styling and two-tone leather upholstery.\n \nThe available navigation system features the latest version of Lexus Enform communication system and App Suite smartphone-application integration. The convertible is available with a red leather interior and an optional F Sport Package includes 18-inch wheels, a front lip spoiler, a sport suspension, and heated and ventilated front seats.\nExterior\nLexus’ LF-series concept cars influenced the IS 250’s styling. A long wheelbase and wide stance help give the IS 250 a muscular look.\n\nAn optional F Sport Package for the sedan includes a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels, and front and rear spoilers. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 18-inch alloy wheels \nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights \nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional backup camera, front and rear parking sensors\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the IS 250 sedan, though the backseat is tight. Bright electroluminescent instruments light up the dashboard. Black metallic trim is standard.\n\nThe optional navigation system’s voice-recognition software picks up casual-language commands, and the standard stereo has a USB port to better integrate iPods or other MP3 players. Lexus’ Enform service, included with the navigation system, can assist in finding street addresses, restaurants and more. It comes with a year of free service; after that, you have to pay a monthly subscription fee. Interior features include:\n\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower moonroof \nManual tilt/telescoping steering wheel (power version optional)\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nA six-speed automatic transmission is standard in the IS 250. The automatic’s steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters give the driver extra involvement when desired. Lexus says the rear-wheel-drive sedan can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n204-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 with 185 pounds-feet of torque\nDouble-wishbone front suspension \nMultilink rear suspension \nAll-wheel-drive models send 70 percent of power to the rear wheels by default; they can automatically route power 50/50 (front/rear) on low-traction surfaces like snow or ice\n\nSafety\nLexus’ Safety Connect service, which automatically notifies authorities in the event of a crash, is standard. Like Enform, a year’s service is included, but after that you’ll have to pay a subscription. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system \nVehicle Dynamic Integrated Management, which is meant to integrate all systems to anticipate skids and react faster than an electronic stability system alone \nKnee airbags for both front occupants \nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\n\n\nIS 250C\nThe IS 250C convertible has a retractable hardtop that Lexus says can operate in just 21 seconds. The four-seat interior features anti-glare gauges, plus audio and climate systems that automatically adjust their settings to compensate for top-down noise and temperatures. Other safety and luxury features remain similar to those on the IS 250 sedan. However, the IS 250C convertible is not available with all-wheel drive. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Lexus IS boasts a number of practical improvements — and that, rather than the hit-and-miss drivability, is what might appeal most to sport-sedan shoppers.\n\nWith its redesigned third-generation IS sedan, Lexus throws down a familiar gauntlet: It wants to build the most fun-to-drive sport sedan in its segment. Yeah, but so does everyone else — and every major luxury brand, from Acura to Volvo, has a gladiator in this arena. The IS has its moments, but Lexus doesn’t drub the class on the fun-to-drive scale. The car’s strengths extend beyond that, however.\n\nThe 2014 IS 250 and IS 350 sedans go on sale this summer. As before, either car comes with rear- or all-wheel drive, with sportier F-Sport packages optional for either car. At a press preview in Austin, Texas, I drove various rear-wheel-drive configurations of the IS 250 and IS 350.\n\nMolten Styling\nThe IS’ headlights steal attention from Lexus’ spindle grille, which now graces almost every vehicle in the brand’s lineup. The headlights sort of melt into the front bumper, with a swoosh of LED daytime running lights strung a few inches ahead. Get the F-Sport Package and the melting spreads. The grille swaps straight crossbars for a hulking mesh abyss, and the whole of it swims in a droopier front bumper. I prefer the styling on the standard IS; Dorothy threw water on this one.\n\nStandard dual tailpipes are a nice touch — some competitors have single pipes with their base engines — and an interesting cutline sweeps from the rocker panel through the rear taillights. Overall length is up 3.4 inches, and wheelbase increases 2.7 inches. Despite the extra size, overall curb weight stays about the same. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, with 18s optional.\n\nCabin Quality\nThe cabin features overlapping layers and splashes of upscale stitched vinyl here and there — a welcome improvement over the Toyota Camry-grade molded faux stitching in the Lexus ES. Materials are decent, with consistent graining toward the center console and optional real wood trim. Even the F-Sport’s fake carbon fiber has a convincing 3-D pattern. The shoe drops on materials below knee level, but the IS has eye candy where you see it.\n\nAtop the dash, a standard 7-inch display governs the CD stereo, which includes HD radio, USB/iPod integration plus Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. Lexus’ available Enform system integrates various apps — Bing, Facebook Places, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable, Pandora and Yelp — from compatible smartphones. Skip the optional Mark Levinson stereo, however; it sounds no better than the last IS’ lackluster Levinson system.\n\nLexus’ NuLuxe vinyl upholstery is standard, with leather seating optional. Most sport sedans have gone that way for years, though the Audi A4 and Acura TL beat the norm with standard leather. Lexus fakes it well. Minus the faint smell of cowhide, the NuLuxe looks and feels like its pricier counterpart. Eight-way power seats are standard, with a longer adjustment range this year. They should suit drivers of all sizes; my 6-foot 6-inch co-driver even said he had enough room.\n\nOverall cabin volume is now 90.2 cubic feet; that’s up a significant 4.5 cubic feet versus the last IS. Lexus cites a full inch of extra headroom and 1.5 inches of extra shoulder room up front, plus 1.6 inches of additional rear legroom. Adults should find backseat legroom fine. That’s a big change from the last IS, which we named one of seven backseats to avoid (read it here).\n\nA standard 60/40-split folding backseat replaces last year’s fixed seat — a welcome addition given competitors like the Acura TL still have a fixed seatback. It’s a high point for an otherwise diminished cargo situation. Trunk room measures 13.8 cubic feet, an increase over last year’s 13 cubic feet and high for the segment. However, the IS’ arm hinges now swing into the trunk space versus the last IS’ hinges — and the ones in every major competitor — that tuck into separate channels.\n\nThe F-Sport Package has high-bolster sport seats that are supportive and comfortable. Citing leather as too slippery for performance driving, Lexus offers them only in NuLuxe. Slippage be damned; Lexus should offer leather in the F-Sport. Other differences include a unique steering wheel, more faux-metal accents and an LCD gauge cluster inspired by Lexus’ short-lived $375,000 LFA. Check out the photos to see the gauges in action.\n\nSame Engines\nThe segment has largely moved toward turbocharged four-cylinder engines, as in the A4, Cadillac ATS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series. There’s something to be said for a normally aspirated V-6, even a small one. The 204-horsepower IS 250 has linear, if modest, power delivery. It’s pokier than the lb-ft torque-rich competition, but you always know what you’re getting with the V-6; some turbo fours deliver peaky, uneven power. (I’m looking at you, Mercedes.) The IS 250’s six-speed automatic has to work harder to keep up the pace; it’s sometimes hunting gears to make the most of the engine’s modest 185 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nLexus says the rear-drive Lexus IS250 hits 60 mph in 7.7 seconds (8.3 seconds with all-wheel drive). Any way you cut it, that’s slow — particularly in a group whose quickest four-cylinder players hit the mark in the 5- and 6-second range. The sluggishness doesn’t pay off much in fuel efficiency: Lexus expects the IS 250 to attain 21/30/24 mpg (city/highway/combined), which matches the old car; AWD sacrifices 1 mpg overall. Several turbo-four competitors rate 1 to 2 mpg higher in combined EPA figures. All drivetrains require premium fuel — a disadvantage over competitors like the 3 Series and Audi A4, which merely recommend it.\n\nLexus expects just one in five IS buyers to choose the 306-hp Lexus IS 350. That’s a shame. It’s a capable vehicle with strong acceleration and overall EPA mileage just 2 mpg worse than the IS 250. AWD IS 350s have a six-speed automatic, and the rear-wheel IS 350 now gets an eight-speed auto. The engine employs both direct and port fuel injection — two injectors per cylinder — and the result lends strong, muscular acceleration through the eight-speed’s short middle gears.\n\nDespite the new transmission, the IS 350 matches its predecessor’s 5.6-second zero-to-60 time, Lexus says. AWD has little effect (5.7 seconds). Citing scant demand in the prior generation, Lexus says it has no plans to offer a manual transmission with either engine. Bah. Less than 2 percent of all 3 Series, ATS and TL sedans in Cars.com inventory have stick shifts, but each nameplate reaps untold credibility with performance enthusiasts simply for offering it.\n\nRide & Handling\nSuspension changes should have liberated the third-gen IS from its predecessor’s choppy ride, but I question whether they did. Driving the new Lexus and its predecessor back to back, I observed no clear differentiation. Damping in the 2014 IS is firm but controlled, with a similar character among all three suspension options: the base setup, the IS 250 F-Sport’s sport-tuned suspension or the IS 350 F-Sport’s new adaptive suspension. The C-Class and softer versions of the 3 Series ride better, and the cruising-oriented Volvo S60 beats the whole crowd.\n\nBut Lexus shines in rapid elevation changes, staying poised in up-and-down pavement where some float. I drove the IS 350 F-Sport and a few competitors at Driveway Austin Motorsports, a technical road course with replicas of world-famous racetrack sections that include Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca’s infamous corkscrew. Challenge the IS with such off-camber fare and it hunkers down and barrels through. The IS 350 F-Sport’s variable-ratio steering feels deliberate — almost heavy — and dials in precise angles, but the nose pushes earlier than the 3 Series, which stands as the drift king of this class. (Fixed-ratio steering is standard.) Even at its firmest setting, the IS 350 F-Sport’s adaptive suspension allows a touch too much body roll for such maneuvers, and with either steering system, sliding the tail out takes practice.\n\nAll IS models get Lexus’ Drive Mode Select system with Eco, Normal and Sport modes that affect power-steering response, drivetrain sensitivity and, in the case of Eco, air conditioning. (EPA ratings were not calculated using Eco mode, Lexus says, and the brand has no internal estimates of the mode’s fuel-efficiency benefits, if any.) Sport mode’s alleged reduction in power-steering assist feels minimal, but it holds lower gears longer and downshifts sooner — both appreciated, especially in the IS 250. The real magic comes from the IS 350 F-Sport, which dispenses Sport mode for “Sport S” and “Sport S+” modes. The latter puts all systems at full boil. Drive the car hard and it’s a reliable ally. The accelerator responds instantly; the eight-speed automatic downshifts aggressively when entering corners and keeps the engine at power-spewing revs when coming out.\n\nThe front disc brakes measure just 11.7 inches in the rear-drive IS 250, which is tiny for this crowd. The IS 350 has larger discs — 13.2 inches up front — and all F-Sport vehicles get high-friction brake pads, which shave off speed with linear pedal action and strong overall stopping power, a relative weakness by contrast in the C-Class and TL.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe IS has not yet been crash-tested – if it ever is, it’ll be published here. Ten standard airbags include a twin-chamber front passenger airbag, which aims to reduce facial contact. The required electronic stability system and antilock brakes are also standard. Safety options run the luxury package gamut. Blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam headlights and lane departure warning are optional. So is adaptive cruise control with a forward collision warning system and automatic braking at the point of no return. Like all such systems, it aims to mitigate — not necessarily prevent — collisions.\n\nLexus will release pricing closer to the IS’ on-sale date this summer. Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, keyless access with push-button start, a moonroof, power front seats with NuLuxe vinyl upholstery and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. Leather, heated and ventilated seats, a heated steering wheel with power tilt/telescoping adjustments, a backup camera, front parking sensors, a navigation system and the aforementioned safety tech are optional.\n\nIS 250, IS 350 in the Market\nLexus claims the IS has younger customers than the 3 Series, A4 or C-Class. That should play well into the model mix, where the brand expects 80 percent of shoppers to choose the IS 250. The car’s practical improvements should boost its appeal to that crowd, which may weigh the drivability aspects less. Lexus won’t conquer the segment with the new IS, but the results should still find enough new buyers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "How much would you pay for a sporty Lexus?\n\nIf you answered $50,000, you certainly know the upscale nature of Toyota’s luxury division. But your guess would be about $15,000 to $20,000 too rich when pondering the tested 2006 Lexus IS 250 luxury sport sedan.\n\nAn IS 250 with a six-speed manual starts at 10 bucks short of $30,000. A top-tier IS 250 with all-wheel drive – the tested model – starts at $34,285.\n\nOK, that’s not pocket change. But considering that a Lexus SC 430 convertible goes for more than $65,000 these days, a Lexus bearing a sticker price around $35,000 deserves a close look.\n\nLexus know this; that’s why it builds the IS 250 and markets it as an entry-level bargain for folks who like the brand but whose budgets might not normally absorb a pricey Lexus purchase.\n\nThe IS 250 is a pretty impressive package for the price.\n\nIt looks good, with elegant, sporty lines – a classic wedge with an abrupt chop at the back bumper. The car’s exterior skin is flared at the wheel wells, a nice, subtle touch.\n\nOn the move, the IS 250 cuts through the air smoothly and almost soundlessly. The comparatively small, 2.5-liter V-6 with variable valve timing generates a robust 204 horsepower.\n\nNailing the accelerator at a standing start does not produce a dragster-like blastoff – the advertised zero-to-60 mph time is a somewhat sedate 8.3 seconds – but the power plant dishes up performance smoothly and forcefully as the seamless, six-speed automatic runs through the gears.\n\nAll-wheel-drive handling in the tester was admirable. The IS 250 took on slalom runs, freeway merges, surface-street scoots and uphill climbs with stability and little jarring of driver and passengers.\n\nSteering had that perfect match of responsiveness and feel. For me, that means it was not so light that the car would jump two lanes right or left if I sneezed.\n\nBrakes are a big deal on this car. The standard offering includes electronic brake force distribution and brake-assist. In the tester, the four-wheel discs stopped the IS 250 on a dime, even on slick surfaces. Very nice.\n\nInside, an attractive dash/center control stack layout was a source of enjoyment. However, three back-seat passengers had to do a little creative leaning and leg folding to approach comfort.\n\nA lengthy list of standard safety features included side-curtain air bags.\n\nWhat’s not to like? Here’s where it gets relative.\n\nThe purchaser of a basic IS 250 must – horror of horrors – manually adjust the steering wheel. And those heated/ventilated seats are going to cost extra.\n\nIn fact, a veteran Lexus customer will find that many of the goodies normally included as standard are listed as optional on the IS 250. That’s particularly true in the comfort/convenience department.\n\nThis will likely prompt the veteran Lexus driver to ask: Why buy the IS 250 when I can get so much more on other Lexus models?\n\nGood question. But it misses the point.\n\nThe IS 250 is not the poor person’s Lexus; it has too much on it to be in that ballpark. But it is a comparatively economical choice for a buyer who wants some of that well-established Lexus flash, reliability and engineering for the price of an upper-end Toyota Camry Solara.\n\nAnd if the snobs poke fun at you for getting a “bargain” $35,000 Lexus, you can drive to the bank, smiling over the money you’ve saved.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the IS 250 has a more muscular sibling – the IS 350, equipped with a 3.5-liter V-6 with 306 horsepower. Lexus touts the zero-to-60 mph trip in that car as a quick 5.6 seconds.\n\nSo if performance matters most, make a point of testing the IS 350 and weighing its manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $35,440.\n\nOutside the Lexus loop, the IS 250 also faces competition from BMW’s 3 Series lineup, which includes similarly alluring prices from a luxury/performance automaker.\n\nBut in my experience, that kind of Lexus-or-BMW angst is going to occur in relatively few cases. For whatever reason, Lexus fans seem to turn up their noses at BMW cars – and vice versa.\n\nDon’t ask me why; I flunked Upscale Car Sociology & Related Trends 101 when I was in college.\n\nAll I know is that my week in the IS 250 produced two memorable impressions: Nice Lexus, nice price.\n\n– – –\n\nThe Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2011 about the 2011 Lexus IS 250. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Lexus has presented luxury shoppers an unlikely offering in the IS, a rear-wheel-drive sport sedan from a brand best known for cushy comfort. The gamble worked: The IS drives better than most of its Lexus siblings. It does not, however, get there without a penalty.\n\nWhile the Lexus IS sedan performs well, it makes drivers give up ride comfort and roominess in ways that its competitors don’t.\n\nLexus restyled a few elements on the IS for 2011, which you can compare with the 2010 model here. The car comes in IS 250 or IS 350 form, representing the size of each one’s V-6 engine. Both are also available as a convertible, denoted by “C” in the model name. Compare them here. The lineup’s high-performance IS-F sedan is covered separately on Cars.com. All-wheel drive is optional on the IS 250 and 350 sedans; in previous years, it was optional only on the IS 250.\n\nWe evaluated two cars: a rear-wheel-drive IS 250C convertible and an all-wheel-drive IS 350 sedan.\n\nQuick, or Not So Much\nEven carrying an extra 176 pounds of driveline, the all-wheel-drive IS 350 moves out. Lexus’ direct-injection V-6 feels on par with the powerhouse six-cylinders in the BMW 335i and Infiniti G37. It pulls strongly, sounds muscular and can generally overtake slower traffic whenever your right foot desires. Aided by a quick-shifting six-speed automatic, the 306-horsepower IS 350 is a confident beast. One editor thought the automatic shifted a bit harshly sometimes, but most agreed it’s a responsive gearbox — not the usual pedigree from parent company Toyota. Still, I wish the IS 350 had a manual transmission. Most competing sedans offer one with their larger engines. Manuals might not sell well, but having one available would make the IS more attractive to performance enthusiasts.\n\nThe 204-hp IS 250 does offer a stick, and you’ll probably need it to wring the most out of the engine. Our test car’s pint-sized V-6 felt two cylinders short. It reminded me of a Mercedes-Benz C240 — the cheapest six-cylinder Mercedes of its time, discontinued in 2006. Like the old Benz, the IS 250’s oomph from a stop is modest, though it’s better in the drivetrain’s Power mode — activated by a dashboard switch — which noticeably hastens accelerator and transmission response (at some cost to fuel efficiency). With three people inside, our convertible needed the drivetrain’s full reserves to reach highway speed.\n\nLexus quotes a zero-to-60 time of 8.4 seconds for the 250 convertible, which is pokey for a luxury car. Weighing 375 pounds less, the rear-drive IS 250 sedan hits the mark in 7.9 seconds, Lexus says. (Incidentally, that’s not far off the C240, which hit the mark in about 8.2 seconds.) Among today’s entry-level sport sedans, the BMW 328i is quicker, and the turbocharged Audi A4 beats both. Lexus has some catching up to do.\n\nRide & Handling\nAs a group, sport sedans ride firmly, but the IS sedan takes things to an extreme that could turn off many shoppers. Wearing 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires, our IS 350 sedan picked up all sorts of bumps, from slight expansion joints to sizable potholes. Our editors agreed it’s uncomfortable, and that’s a sacrifice you don’t necessarily have to make. The 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class ride decidedly better. Believe it or not, you could probably get the IS to ride even worse: Options include 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, as well as a performance-tuned F-Sport suspension.\n\nThanks to distinct suspension tuning, the convertible rides blessedly softer. Our IS 250C, which had the same 17-inch wheels, isolated road imperfections the sedan played up harshly. On the flip side, it didn’t have the most rigid structure. With the top down, the windshield frame shuddered a bit over broken pavement, but that’s a common characteristic in four-seat convertibles.\n\nSome may want more power steering assist at low speeds, in the vein of the A4 or C-Class, but the IS exhibits better feedback than either of those cars. The nose pushes a bit at first when barreling into sweeping curves, but the car settles on its rear nicely on the way out, proving nearly as drift-happy as a 3 Series or G37. My only gripe involves body roll, which was noticeable in both our cars.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin’s businesslike tones and low-gloss textures are typical Lexus traits, but our test cars’ faux metal trim and rubberized dash contours drew criticism. The door and center armrests felt short on padding. The A4 and G have better cabins, and just about every competitor is roomier. The IS’ cramped dimensions are apparent no matter where you’re sitting. Two editors bemoaned tight headroom in the sedan, and several noted the cabin’s narrowness, in part due to a wide center console that encroaches on hip and knee room.\n\nThe power-adjustable front seats are supportive and generally comfortable, and their long adjustment range should accommodate adults up to the low-6-foot range — backseat space be damned. And damned it is; legroom is as miserable there as in the 3 Series sedan, and headroom is tenable only because the seat sits low to the floor. Adults’ knees will either be raised in the air or digging into the front seatbacks, or both. Indeed, with 86 cubic feet of cabin volume, the IS sedan is among the smallest cars in its class. By the EPA’s standards, it’s a subcompact car. Similar money can get you a car one or two sizes larger, in the G37 or A4, and the Acura TL is even roomier. It’s 2011, and a sport sedan need not be this cramped.\n\nLexus offers the usual gamut of luxury options, from heated and ventilated front seats to a power rear sunshade. The optional Mark Levinson stereo, however, is worth skipping. We don’t often get deep into audiophile territory, but three editors remarked on their strong lack of love for the Levinson. No matter our adjustments, the treble was crashy and distorted, and the bass was a muddled mess. In a league with such aural standouts as the TL’s ELS stereo or the A4’s Bang & Olufsen system, Lexus disappoints.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the IS sedan earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side impacts. However, rear and roof-strength ratings were just Acceptable — one rung down from Good. It’s important to note these scores don’t translate to the IS convertible, which hasn’t been tested. Standard features include chest and knee airbags, plus seat-mounted side-impact airbags and two-row side curtain airbags in the sedan. The IS convertible has no curtain airbags, but its side-impact airbags include head extensions. Click here for a full list of features. On automatic convertibles, a collision warning system comes with the optional adaptive cruise control.\n\nReliability for the IS sedan has been good, but the convertible has performed below average. The stick-shift IS 250 starts at $33,295. That’s not bad given its generous list of standard features: an iPod/USB-compatible stereo, eight-way power front seats with power lumbar, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof and leather upholstery. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, a power rear sunshade, a navigation system, the Mark Levinson audio system and a backup camera. The IS 350 starts at $39,720 but comes standard with the automatic transmission. So do all-wheel-drive variants, which add $2,460 to $3,630 to the price tag, depending on the engine. Load up an all-wheel-drive IS 350, and the price nears $50,000. The IS convertible tops out near $57,000.\n\nIS in the Market\nThe IS has never put much of a dent in 3 Series sales. It’s been as popular as Audi’s A4 and S4, which are distant second-tier players in the heady entry-level luxury class. Lexus, however, looks to be on the verge of a product renaissance, in the vein of what happened to the brand mid-decade. Here’s hoping the IS’ coming makeover solves its practical issues — but doesn’t water down what’s good.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Lexus IS 250 isn’t your average family sedan. Lexus says it can fit five occupants, but my family of four would respectfully disagree with that number. I practically had to cram my whole family into the IS 250. After spending a week test-driving it, I think I’ve found its place in a mom’s life: The IS 250 is the car you get once you become an empty-nester.\n\nWhat makes this the perfect car for when you’re on your own? You don’t have to share it with anyone, and you won’t have to worry about your teen sneaking it out (because they will try, you know it’s true). Just think, once the kids are out of the house, you’ll be responsible for just you (and maybe your husband); you can finally indulge a little. Yay for you (I think I’m a little jealous)!\n\nIf you’re still considering the IS 250 for your small family, I understand why you would. With this Lexus you can indulge in luxury car for less dough; the IS 250 has an MSRP of $34,785. Yes, that’s a pretty penny to be sure, however, you get leather seats, a moonroof, a fabulous stereo system, all-wheel drive (if you are more of a race-car mama, rear-wheel drive is available, too), and a bevy of safety features. This makes the entry-level IS 250 pretty tantalizing.\n\nThe IS 250 is a lot of fun to drive, but I can’t help feeling that it should have a manual transmission with its V-6 engine. The automatic with paddle shifters almost makes me forget that I wish the IS 250 had a little more power. I know it’s not very, um, fuel-efficient of me, but I must floor the IS 250 everywhere I go to get that goofy, speed-induced grin. Thankfully, this car gets an EPA-estimated 20/26 mpg city/highway, so I can feel less guilty when I floor it. The IS 250 also has responsive brakes and steering. As a result, the IS 250 made me happiest when it was just me and her, with no complaints of car sickness from the backseat.\n\nExterior\n\nThe IS 250 is a sporty-looking four-door number that looks completely different in different colors. My silver test car was sharp-looking, but even sharper was a black IS 250 I saw while driving around in the IS. It looks beautiful in every color offered, but the color really changes the vibe of the car.\n\nRegardless of color, I love the way the IS 250 looks. The front is aggressive-looking, while the rear end has lovely taillights and nice lines. Much of the time, a car’s rear looks neglected by its designers. That’s not so with the IS 250. The reverse lights are L-shaped and match the logo’s lines. Love it.\n\nI also liked the power-folding and heated side mirrors. It’s one of those wonderful luxuries that you don’t want to live without.\n\nThere aren’t any visibility problems in the IS 250. My kids didn’t have any problems getting in or out of the IS 250, but the complaints started once they were situated inside.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nInterior\n\nThe kids liked the IS 250 best when it was just me and only one of them in the car; otherwise they felt cramped when they were both in the backseat. You know who else will feel cramped? The person sitting in front of a rear-facing infant-safety seat. The Latch connectors are easy to locate and access (they’re under a leather flap), but you’ll likely be driving with your knees at your chin if you have an infant seat in back of you. Yes, the IS 250 would probably still be a kick to drive in that scenario, but it’s less than ideal, people. If you have one child, you’re golden. Have two and … well, you know where I’m going with this. Maybe consider the IS 250 as a second car.\n\nThe seat belts were deceiving because they seemed to be recessed, which is a big hurdle for smaller kids trying to buckle themselves in. I was getting ready to gripe when the receptors came out from their little recessed hole, making my complaint almost moot. I say almost moot because some kids – most likely kids who are new to booster seats – will struggle with the flimsy receptors.\n\nOnce I got the kids off to school, I had some me-time in the IS 250 and found there’s a lot to like. I love the layout of the interior because everything was within reach. The center stack has a simplistic design to it. I was insanely, perfectly comfortable in the eight-way power-adjustable leather seats, too. I also was relieved that my test car didn’t have a navigation system; a navigation system with a backup camera is available. I know it’s my job to review these technological wonders and report back to you, but navigation systems really make me crazy. It was so refreshing to get into a nicely appointed, beautiful car and not be confronted with screens forcing me to press a button to accept that driving while nav-ing is dangerous just so I can get to the stereo controls.\n\nI think the IS 250 liked it best when it was just the two of us because she only has one cupholder that’s easily accessible in the front seat. The second cupholder is in the center console, under the lid. This isn’t a travesty, given many who buy this car probably won’t use it as a family truckster. However, consider yourself warned.\n\nThe IS 250 has one of my favorite over-the-top test car features: ventilated seats. Ventilated seats mitigate the argument against black-colored leather seats that become hot in the sun and burn the backs of your thighs. Yes, the argument that black leather scuffs too easily and shows too much gunk is still relevant, but I’m sure Lexus is working on that. Right, Lexus?\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nSafety\n\nWriting a Lexus review always means there’s a long list of safety features to discuss, and the IS 250 is no different. The IS 250 comes with antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. It has eight airbags, including front-, side-impact and side curtain airbags, as well as knee airbags for the driver and front passenger. The power windows have pinch protection to protect little fingers.\n\nI’ve invented a game called the Mystery Button. Whenever I get a test car, I find a button that no one can figure out what it does. Trust me, every car has one, and it can take awhile to figure out the mystery button’s purpose. In the IS 250, the mystery button is for the Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. This is a great feature that uses radar to detect a car in front of you. If a car is detected, the IS 250 will reduce its speed to keep your car at a safe distance. This allows you to use cruise control more effectively when there are other cars on the road.\n\nAn optional Pre-Collision System also uses radar to detect impending collisions. The system tenses up the seat belts and preloads the brakes if it senses a collision.",

      "expert_review": "For more than 10 years, Lexus has presented luxury shoppers an unlikely offering in the IS, a rear-wheel-drive sport sedan from a brand best known for cushy comfort. The gamble worked: The IS drives better than most of its Lexus siblings. It does not, however, get there without a penalty.\n\nWhile the Lexus IS sedan performs well, it makes drivers give up ride comfort and roominess in ways that its competitors don’t.\n\nLexus restyled a few elements on the IS for 2011, which you can compare with the 2010 model here. The car comes in IS 250 or IS 350 form, representing the size of each one’s V-6 engine. Both are also available as a convertible, denoted by “C” in the model name. The lineup’s high-performance IS-F sedan is covered separately on Cars.com. All-wheel drive is optional on the IS 250 and 350 sedans; in previous years, it was optional only on the IS 250.\n\nWe evaluated two cars: a rear-wheel-drive IS 250C convertible and an all-wheel-drive IS 350 sedan.\n\nQuick, or Not So Much\nEven carrying an extra 176 pounds of driveline, the all-wheel-drive IS 350 moves out. Lexus’ direct-injection V-6 feels on par with the powerhouse six-cylinders in the BMW 335i and Infiniti G37. It pulls strongly, sounds muscular and can generally overtake slower traffic whenever your right foot desires. Aided by a quick-shifting six-speed automatic, the 306-horsepower IS 350 is a confident beast. One editor thought the automatic shifted a bit harshly sometimes, but most agreed it’s a responsive gearbox — not the usual pedigree from parent company Toyota. Still, I wish the IS 350 had a manual transmission. Most competing sedans offer one with their larger engines. Manuals might not sell well, but having one available would make the IS more attractive to performance enthusiasts.\n\nThe 204-hp IS 250 does offer a stick, and you’ll probably need it to wring the most out of the engine. Our test car’s pint-sized V-6 felt two cylinders short. It reminded me of a Mercedes-Benz C240 — the cheapest six-cylinder Mercedes of its time, discontinued in 2006. Like the old Benz, the IS 250’s oomph from a stop is modest, though it’s better in the drivetrain’s Power mode — activated by a dashboard switch — which noticeably hastens accelerator and transmission response (at some cost to fuel efficiency). With three people inside, our convertible needed the drivetrain’s full reserves to reach highway speed.\n\nLexus quotes a zero-to-60 time of 8.4 seconds for the 250 convertible, which is pokey for a luxury car. Weighing 375 pounds less, the rear-drive IS 250 sedan hits the mark in 7.9 seconds, Lexus says. (Incidentally, that’s not far off the C240, which hit the mark in about 8.2 seconds.) Among today’s entry-level sport sedans, the BMW 328i is quicker, and the turbocharged Audi A4 beats both. Lexus has some catching up to do.\n\nRide & Handling\nAs a group, sport sedans ride firmly, but the IS sedan takes things to an extreme that could turn off many shoppers. Wearing 17-inch wheels and P225/45R17 tires, our IS 350 sedan picked up all sorts of bumps, from slight expansion joints to sizable potholes. Our editors agreed it’s uncomfortable, and that’s a sacrifice you don’t necessarily have to make. The 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class ride decidedly better. Believe it or not, you could probably get the IS to ride even worse: Options include 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires, as well as a performance-tuned F-Sport suspension.\n\nThanks to distinct suspension tuning, the convertible rides blessedly softer. Our IS 250C, which had the same 17-inch wheels, isolated road imperfections the sedan played up harshly. On the flip side, it didn’t have the most rigid structure. With the top down, the windshield frame shuddered a bit over broken pavement, but that’s a common characteristic in four-seat convertibles.\n\nSome may want more power steering assist at low speeds, in the vein of the A4 or C-Class, but the IS exhibits better feedback than either of those cars. The nose pushes a bit at first when barreling into sweeping curves, but the car settles on its rear nicely on the way out, proving nearly as drift-happy as a 3 Series or G37. My only gripe involves body roll, which was noticeable in both our cars.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin’s businesslike tones and low-gloss textures are typical Lexus traits, but our test cars’ faux metal trim and rubberized dash contours drew criticism. The door and center armrests felt short on padding. The A4 and G have better cabins, and just about every competitor is roomier. The IS’ cramped dimensions are apparent no matter where you’re sitting. Two editors bemoaned tight headroom in the sedan, and several noted the cabin’s narrowness, in part due to a wide center console that encroaches on hip and knee room.\n\nThe power-adjustable front seats are supportive and generally comfortable, and their long adjustment range should accommodate adults up to the low-6-foot range — backseat space be damned. And damned it is; legroom is as miserable there as in the 3 Series sedan, and headroom is tenable only because the seat sits low to the floor. Adults’ knees will either be raised in the air or digging into the front seatbacks, or both. Indeed, with 86 cubic feet of cabin volume, the IS sedan is among the smallest cars in its class. By the EPA’s standards, it’s a subcompact car. Similar money can get you a car one or two sizes larger, in the G37 or A4, and the Acura TL is even roomier. It’s 2011, and a sport sedan need not be this cramped.\n\nLexus offers the usual gamut of luxury options, from heated and ventilated front seats to a power rear sunshade. The optional Mark Levinson stereo, however, is worth skipping. We don’t often get deep into audiophile territory, but three editors remarked on their strong lack of love for the Levinson. No matter our adjustments, the treble was crashy and distorted, and the bass was a muddled mess. In a league with such aural standouts as the TL’s ELS stereo or the A4’s Bang & Olufsen system, Lexus disappoints.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the IS sedan earned the top score, Good, in frontal and side impacts. However, rear and roof-strength ratings were just Acceptable — one rung down from Good. It’s important to note these scores don’t translate to the IS convertible, which hasn’t been tested. Standard features include chest and knee airbags, plus seat-mounted side-impact airbags and two-row side curtain airbags in the sedan. The IS convertible has no curtain airbags, but its side-impact airbags include head extensions. Click here for a full list of features. On automatic convertibles, a collision warning system comes with the optional adaptive cruise control.\n\nReliability for the IS sedan has been good, but the convertible has performed below average. The stick-shift IS 250 starts at $33,295. That’s not bad given its generous list of standard features: an iPod/USB-compatible stereo, eight-way power front seats with power lumbar, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof and leather upholstery. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, a power rear sunshade, a navigation system, the Mark Levinson audio system and a backup camera. The IS 350 starts at $39,720 but comes standard with the automatic transmission. So do all-wheel-drive variants, which add $2,460 to $3,630 to the price tag, depending on the engine. Load up an all-wheel-drive IS 350, and the price nears $50,000. The IS convertible tops out near $57,000.\n\nIS in the Market\nThe IS has never put much of a dent in 3 Series sales. It’s been as popular as Audi’s A4 and S4, which are distant second-tier players in the heady entry-level luxury class. Lexus, however, looks to be on the verge of a product renaissance, in the vein of what happened to the brand mid-decade. Here’s hoping the IS’ coming makeover solves its practical issues — but doesn’t water down what’s good.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Lexus positions the IS series as a BMW 3-Series fighter, and while it certainly is on paper, it doesn’t quite make that point in person. At least until this year, when Lexus introduced the V-8-powered, 416-horsepower IS F, the first time this model has had a genuine performance version to rally around.\n\nLikely Lexus is hoping the electricity from the limited-edition IS F rubs off a little on the rest of the IS lineup, like the test car, a 2008 IS 250, meaning it has a 2.5-liter V-6 engine. The IS 350 has a 3.5-liter V-6. The IS is the entry-level Lexus, though many people think of the ES as the least expensive model. The front-wheel-drive ES 350 is essentially a deluxe version of the Toyota Camry, targeted at a more mature demographic than the IS. The rear-wheel-drive IS really doesn’t have a platform counterpart in the U.S. Toyota lineup. The test IS 250, while the least expensive model in the family, is hardly a stripped-down model: Standard equipment includes leather upholstery, a power moon roof, a 13-speaker sound system and most all the safety equipment presently offered, including stability control, anti-lock disc brakes with brakeforce distribution and brake assist; side and side-curtain air bags, and even knee air bags for the front seats. And, very BMW-like, there’s a first-aid kit, and a tool kit.\n\nBase price on the test car was $31,625, and that’s with a six-speed automatic transmission. The IS 250 is offered for slightly less with a manual transmission, but few Lexus buyers have shown much interest in shifting for themselves.\n\nThat’s fine: The six-speed automatic, with steering wheel-mounted shifter paddles should you be in the mood to shift, works very well, which is good, since the little 2.5-liter, 204-horsepower V-6 needs all the help it can get. It’s a very good engine, just taxed a bit with a fairly heavy car. Since the V-6 engine in the Toyota Camry has 268 horsepower, the 204-horse engine in the premium Lexus is not exactly a selling point. That said, fuel mileage isn’t bad, at an EPA-rated 21 mpg city, 29 mpg highway.\n\nInside, the IS 250 is comfortable up front, a little cramped in the rear. Instruments and controls are thoughtfully designed, and the navigation system is very easy to use, one of the best offered.\n\nOn the road, the IS 250 is quick and sure-footed, aided in this case by larger 18-inch tires and wheels, an $830 option over the standard 17-inchers. Also optional: That navigation system with a rear back-up camera ($2,550), a premium package with upgraded leather upholstery, heated and cooled front seats and wood trim ($1,290), and upgraded lighting ($875). Shipping and a few smaller options raised the list price to $38,254.\n\nThe IS 250’s 2.5-liter V-6 is adequate in every situation, but the IS 350’s 306-horsepower engine more befits a luxury brand. That engine adds more than $4,000 to the price and gets worse fuel mileage.The Lexus IS series are all excellent cars, but there are a lot of excellent cars in this class, including the aforementioned BMW 3-Series, the Audi A4 and the Infiniti G35. It’s tough to go wrong in this category.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Lexus IS 250. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Lexus IS boasts a number of practical improvements — and that, rather than the hit-and-miss drivability, is what might appeal most to sport-sedan shoppers.\n\nWith its redesigned third-generation IS sedan, Lexus throws down a familiar gauntlet: It wants to build the most fun-to-drive sport sedan in its segment. Yeah, but so does everyone else — and every major luxury brand, from Acura to Volvo, has a gladiator in this arena. The IS has its moments, but Lexus doesn’t drub the class on the fun-to-drive scale. The car’s strengths extend beyond that, however.\n\nThe 2014 IS 250 and IS 350 sedans go on sale this summer. As before, either car comes with rear- or all-wheel drive, with sportier F-Sport packages optional for either car. At a press preview in Austin, Texas, I drove various rear-drive configurations of the IS 250 and IS 350.\n\nMolten Styling\nThe IS’ headlights steal attention from Lexus’ spindle grille, which now graces almost every car in the brand’s lineup. The headlights sort of melt into the front bumper, with a swoosh of LED daytime running lights strung a few inches ahead. Get the F-Sport Package and the melting spreads. The grille swaps straight crossbars for a hulking mesh abyss, and the whole of it swims in a droopier front bumper. I prefer the styling on the standard IS; Dorothy threw water on this one.\n\nStandard dual tailpipes are a nice touch — some competitors have single pipes with their base engines — and an interesting cutline sweeps from the rocker panel through the rear taillights. Overall length is up 3.4 inches, and wheelbase increases 2.7 inches. Despite the extra size, overall curb weight stays about the same. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, with 18s optional.\n\nCabin Quality\nThe cabin features overlapping layers and splashes of upscale stitched vinyl here and there — a welcome improvement over the Toyota Camry-grade molded faux stitching in the Lexus ES. Materials are decent, with consistent graining toward the center console and optional real wood trim. Even the F-Sport’s fake carbon fiber has a convincing 3-D pattern. The shoe drops on materials below knee level, but the IS has eye candy where you see it.\n\nAtop the dash, a standard 7-inch display governs the CD stereo, which includes HD radio, USB/iPod integration plus Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. Lexus’ available Enform system integrates various apps — Bing, Facebook Places, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable, Pandora and Yelp — from compatible smartphones. Skip the optional Mark Levinson stereo, however; it sounds no better than the last IS’ lackluster Levinson system.\n\nLexus’ NuLuxe vinyl upholstery is standard, with leather seating optional. Most sport sedans have gone that way for years, though the Audi A4 and Acura TL beat the norm with standard leather. Lexus fakes it well. Minus the faint smell of cowhide, the NuLuxe looks and feels like its pricier counterpart. Eight-way power seats are standard, with a longer adjustment range this year. They should suit drivers of all sizes; my 6-foot 6-inch co-driver even said he had enough room.\n\nOverall cabin volume is now 90.2 cubic feet; that’s up a significant 4.5 cubic feet versus the last IS. Lexus cites a full inch of extra headroom and 1.5 inches of extra shoulder room up front, plus 1.6 inches of additional rear legroom. Adults should find backseat legroom fine. That’s a big change from the last IS, which we named one of seven backseats to avoid (read it here).\n\nA standard 60/40-split folding backseat replaces last year’s fixed seat — a welcome addition given competitors like the Acura TL still have a fixed seatback. It’s a high point for an otherwise diminished cargo situation. Trunk room measures 10.8 cubic feet, which is down from last year’s 13 cubic feet and near the bottom of the segment. Worse still, the IS’ arm hinges now swing into the trunk space versus the last IS’ hinges — and the ones in every major competitor — that tuck into separate channels.\n\nThe F-Sport Package has high-bolster sport seats that are supportive and comfortable. Citing leather as too slippery for performance driving, Lexus offers them only in NuLuxe. Slippage be damned; Lexus should offer leather in the F-Sport. Other differences include a unique steering wheel, more faux-metal accents and an LCD gauge cluster inspired by Lexus’ short-lived $375,000 LFA. Check out the photos to see the gauges in action.\n\nSame Engines\nThe segment has largely moved toward turbocharged four-cylinder engines, as in the A4, Cadillac ATS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series. There’s something to be said for a normally aspirated V-6, even a small one. The 204-horsepower IS 250 has linear, if modest, power delivery. It’s pokier than the torque-rich competition, but you always know what you’re getting with the V-6; some turbo fours deliver peaky, uneven power. (I’m looking at you, Mercedes.) The IS 250’s six-speed automatic has to work harder to keep up the pace; it’s sometimes hunting gears to make the most of the engine’s modest 185 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nLexus says the rear-drive IS 250 hits 60 mph in 7.7 seconds (8.3 seconds with all-wheel drive). Any way you cut it, that’s slow — particularly in a group whose quickest four-cylinder players hit the mark in the 5- and 6-second range. The sluggishness doesn’t pay off much in fuel efficiency: Lexus expects the IS 250 to attain 21/30/24 mpg (city/highway/combined), which matches the old car; all-wheel drive sacrifices 1 mpg overall. Several turbo-four competitors rate 1 to 2 mpg higher in combined EPA figures. All drivetrains require premium fuel — a disadvantage over competitors like the 3 Series and Audi A4, which merely recommend it.\n\nLexus expects just one in five IS buyers to choose the 306-hp IS 350. That’s a shame. It’s a capable car with strong acceleration and overall EPA mileage just 2 mpg worse than the IS 250. All-wheel-drive IS 350s have a six-speed automatic, and the rear-drive IS 350 now gets an eight-speed auto. The engine employs both direct and port fuel injection — two injectors per cylinder — and the result lends strong, muscular acceleration through the eight-speed’s short middle gears.\n\nDespite the new transmission, the IS 350 matches its predecessor’s 5.6-second zero-to-60 time, Lexus says. All-wheel drive has little effect (5.7 seconds). Citing scant demand in the prior generation, Lexus says it has no plans to offer a manual transmission with either engine. Bah. Less than 2 percent of all 3 Series, ATS and TL sedans in Cars.com inventory have stick shifts, but each nameplate reaps untold credibility with performance enthusiasts simply for offering it.\n\nRide & Handling\nSuspension changes should have liberated the third-gen IS from its predecessor’s choppy ride, but I question whether they did. Driving the new Lexus and its predecessor back to back, I observed no clear differentiation. Damping in the 2014 IS is firm but controlled, with a similar character among all three suspension options: the base setup, the IS 250 F-Sport’s sport-tuned suspension or the IS 350 F-Sport’s new adaptive suspension. The C-Class and softer versions of the 3 Series ride better, and the cruising-oriented Volvo S60 beats the whole crowd.\n\nBut Lexus shines in rapid elevation changes, staying poised in up-and-down pavement where some float. I drove the IS 350 F-Sport and a few competitors at Driveway Austin Motorsports, a technical road course with replicas of world-famous racetrack sections that include Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca’s infamous corkscrew. Challenge the IS with such off-camber fare and it hunkers down and barrels through. The IS 350 F-Sport’s variable-ratio steering feels deliberate — almost heavy — and dials in precise angles, but the nose pushes earlier than the 3 Series, which stands as the drift king of this class. (Fixed-ratio steering is standard.) Even at its firmest setting, the IS 350 F-Sport’s adaptive suspension allows a touch too much body roll for such maneuvers, and with either steering system, sliding the tail out takes practice.\n\nAll IS models get Lexus’ Drive Mode Select system with Eco, Normal and Sport modes that affect power-steering response, drivetrain sensitivity and, in the case of Eco, air conditioning. (EPA ratings were not calculated using Eco mode, Lexus says, and the brand has no internal estimates of the mode’s fuel-efficiency benefits, if any.) Sport mode’s alleged reduction in power-steering assist feels minimal, but it holds lower gears longer and downshifts sooner — both appreciated, especially in the IS 250. The real magic comes from the IS 350 F-Sport, which dispenses Sport mode for “Sport S” and “Sport S+” modes. The latter puts all systems at full boil. Drive the car hard and it’s a reliable ally. The accelerator responds instantly; the eight-speed automatic downshifts aggressively when entering corners and keeps the engine at power-spewing revs when coming out.\n\nThe front disc brakes measure just 11.7 inches in the rear-drive IS 250, which is tiny for this crowd. The IS 350 has larger discs — 13.2 inches up front — and all F-Sport cars get high-friction brake pads, which shave off speed with linear pedal action and strong overall stopping power, a relative weakness by contrast in the C-Class and TL.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe IS has not yet been crash-tested. Ten standard airbags include a twin-chamber front passenger airbag, which aims to reduce facial contact. The required electronic stability system and antilock brakes are also standard. Safety options run the luxury gamut. Blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam headlights and lane departure warning are optional. So is adaptive cruise control with a forward collision warning system and automatic braking at the point of no return. Like all such systems, it aims to mitigate — not necessarily prevent — collisions.\n\nLexus will release pricing closer to the IS’ on-sale date this summer. Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, keyless access with push-button start, a moonroof, power front seats with NuLuxe vinyl upholstery and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. Leather, heated and ventilated seats, a heated steering wheel with power tilt/telescoping adjustments, a backup camera, front parking sensors, a navigation system and the aforementioned safety tech are optional.\n\nIS 250, IS 350 in the Market\nLexus claims the IS has younger customers than the 3 Series, A4 or C-Class. That should play well into the model mix, where the brand expects 80 percent of shoppers to choose the IS 250. The car’s practical improvements should boost its appeal to that crowd, which may weigh the drivability aspects less. Lexus won’t conquer the segment with the new IS, but the results should still find enough new buyers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
