      "expert_review": "I’m not gonna lie, self-driving cars freak me out a little bit. It takes a shift in expectations and perceptions to push a button, sit back and let a 3-ton automobile guide itself down the highway at 75 mph while you just sit with your hands in your lap. First of all, we need to reiterate that no car on the market today has an actual fully autonomous self-driving system, not GM’s Super Cruise, not Tesla’s Autopilot. All these systems are driver-assist systems meant to be used by drivers who are still present, conscious and cognizant of the vehicle’s operation and environment. \n\nI’ve sampled such driver-assist systems in a number of different automakers’ offerings, from Mercedes-Benz to GM, and now I’ve sampled the latest partial hands-free system from Toyota in the form of Lexus Teammate, built into prototypes of the Lexus LS 500h luxury flagship sedan and demonstrated recently at Toyota’s North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. \n\nRelated: What’s New From Lexus for 2021?\n\nLexus Teammate system | Manufacturer image\nWhat Is Lexus Teammate? \n\nLexus Teammate is the latest iteration of years of development work, sensor fusion, software creation and human-machine interaction studies to create a Level 2 semi-autonomous system: meaning it has the ability to accelerate, stop and steer the vehicle, but it still very much requires a human monitoring its actions at all times. How much monitoring? More than one might expect.\n\nLexus’ Teammate has two functions: Advanced Drive and Advanced Park. I sampled Advanced Drive on the highways of suburban Dallas. It will be available in the all-wheel-drive 2022 Lexus LS 500h later this fall. It’s meant as a system that augments the driver for additional safety and to ostensibly reduce fatigue; Lexus is not billing it as a self-driving system, but a driving assistant. Through a combination of sensors and high-definition maps downloaded from a central server, it allows varying degrees of semi-autonomous, hands-free cruise control. But it’s more than just advanced cruise control, because it has a predictive feature that analyzes the route and traffic, and can do things like decide to overtake an adjacent vehicle when changing lanes, or slow the vehicle for an off-ramp or connecting ramp between highways. It can also exit the highway entirely, and it provides the driver with an up to 6-mile plan of what it intends to do. This is useful in warning drivers when they’ll be required to fully take over piloting the vehicle, but in my experience with the Teammate system, the driver never truly gives up control of the vehicle. Let me explain.\n\nLexus Teammate system | Manufacturer image\nHow Is It Different From Super Cruise?\n\nThe majority of my experience with semi-autonomous driver-assist systems comes in the form of GM’s latest Super Cruise. GM’s Super Cruise was the latest version I’ve been in, having driven it in a new 2021 Cadillac Escalade equipped with the new software that also allows hands-free lane changes. Where Teammate seems to differ most from other systems is in the level of involvement and constant attention required from the driver. For instance, Super Cruise will work very hard to maintain a hands-off approach, while Teammate will insist you put a hand on the wheel at seemingly random times for no obvious reason. It may steer autonomously for a few miles, insist you put a hand on the wheel for a few minutes, and then go back to not requiring you to touch the wheel, despite the conditions and road surface not noticeably changing. \n\nIf you want to engage a lane change, Super Cruise has you engage the signal and then it scans to make sure the way is clear in the adjacent lane before guiding the car over there itself. Teammate requires extra steps: The driver must physically check mirrors or turn their head before executing the lane change; it has an infrared camera pointed at the driver’s face the whole time to make sure the driver does one of those things or it won’t engage the automatic lane change. It also may decide not to allow the lane change you’ve requested if it doesn’t like where you want to do it — maybe there’s a highway on-ramp coming up or you’ve just passed one, or for some other reason not made clear to you. Super Cruise makes no such judgments because it trusts you’re already looking to see if the way is clear and its scan merely confirms the environment, and it moves the vehicle as you’ve requested. In a nutshell, Lexus Teammate is fussier, seemingly less trusting of the driver, and requires a significantly greater level of driver participation and monitoring in what is supposed to be a Level 2 semi-autonomous system.\n\nLexus Teammate system | Manufacturer image\n\nWhile Teammate requires the driver to be a much more active participant in the experience, there’s one area where Teammate stands out compared to Super Cruise: Teammate ties into the car’s navigation system, so you can input your destination and the car knows essentially how to drive you there. Super Cruise doesn’t match this yet. It’s not a “fire and forget” kind of system (yet); it requires you to be an active participant as described above, but the system knows where you’re going, and the predictive nature of Teammate is employed to change highways on connecting ramps by selecting the lanes you need to be in to exit a highway at the exit you need, automatically moving the car to them (conditions permitting). It can pick speeds for those ramps, and it can even exit the highway and send you through a tollbooth. Teammate cuts out once you’ve left the highway, but it also warns you exactly when you’ll need to take over — just make sure you let it know you have taken over by touching the brake or accelerator. Touching the wheel or steering yourself doesn’t do that, annoyingly. \n\nLexus Teammate system | Manufacturer image\nWhat Does It Do Better Than Super Cruise?\n\nThat’s a premature question, for the moment. The version I drove was not the final production software, so there might be more refinement before Teammate hits the streets later this year. In some ways, GM’s Super Cruise is better — it seems to maintain more autonomous control over the vehicle for longer periods of time and in more conditions than Lexus Teammate. Teammate requires a lot more operator attention and involvement, to the point that I begin to question its purpose.  If I’m expected to be doing everything I would normally be doing while driving a car (turning my head to check blind spots, keeping my hands on the wheel), what’s the point of engaging a semi-autonomous drive system? I may as well just drive the car myself. \n\nBut the Lexus system’s ability to tie into the navigation system and control more aspects of the car’s operation to guide you to that destination gives it a tasty advantage in that area. But until then, the trade-offs of the aggressive level of monitoring and the highly conservative ethos of where and when the system will properly engage have me leaning toward Super Cruise still being the best system of the two. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2021?\nUpdated 2021 Lexus IS Gets Updated Pricing, Starts at $40,025\n2021 Lexus IS: ‘I’ Is for Improved, ‘S’ is for Sort Of\n2021 Lexus ES Offers AWD, Smaller Engine and Black Line Special Edition\n2021 Lexus IS 350 Review: Refocused but Not Rejuvenated\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: An old-school luxury sedan that struggles with modern-day life, the 2024 Lexus LS 500h is a comfy but dated throwback to an earlier time.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s not as spacious, not as sophisticated and not as modern or stylish as its German and Korean competitors, but Lexus’ uncomplicated approach just might be what its loyal customers are looking for.\n\nFull-size luxury sedans are getting complicated. Look at the new Mercedes-Benz models: The E-Class and S-Class have glass cockpits and multimedia systems so crazy you need astronaut training to adjust the temperature. The latest BMW 7 Series isn’t any better, and I often wonder how older buyers — who are precisely the target market for expensive, traditional luxury sedans — are supposed to be able to use these tech-laden new cars when I, an experienced automotive journalist, often have trouble figuring them out. \n\nBucking this trend, the Lexus LS 500h does not suffer from overcomplication. That’s partly by design — it features a lot of dedicated buttons and knobs instead of touch-based controls — and partly due to circumstances. Lexus’ flagship luxury sedan hasn’t seen a redesign in years, debuting in its current guise for the 2018 model year and getting a mild interior refresh for 2021. But can its throwback charm stand up to the new wave of competitors’ glass-cockpit luxury flagships? We drove a hybrid-powered LS 500h for a week to find out.\n\nRelated: Haku, Kiriko and Teammate: 2024 Lexus LS Priced From $80,685\n\nWe’ve Seen This Look Before\n\nTo be blunt, the LS 500h looks too much like last year’s Toyota Camry. Its styling was updated in its 2018 redesign, making it more swoopy. Its then-new lower roofline and big spindle grille were de rigueur for Lexus models last decade, but they’ve been toned down on the brand’s latest offerings (see the 2024 RX and TX SUVs). \n\nEven so, Lexus’ whole sedan lineup feels like a derivative of the Toyota lineup (or maybe it’s vice versa), which makes sense given Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand. The two lineups feature similar squinty headlights, big “fish-mouth” grilles and slim taillights. It’s an almost biological look, with more flowing, organic shapes than you see on, say, a Genesis G90, which features more formal, upright and angular surfaces. It’s not unattractive, but it is overly familiar and well used. With Toyota sedans now going for a new look, we’re looking forward to what the next Lexus sedan family look will be — and hoping it’s quite different from what we have now. \n\nA Classy, Simple Interior\n\nIf all the latest touch controls in German luxury cars have your head spinning, longing for the days when you could accomplish a simple task using a simple, easy-to-use button, then the LS 500h is absolutely your luxury sedan. An update for 2021 saw the interior get a new touchscreen-based multimedia system, but Lexus didn’t move all the LS’ ancillary controls — things like climate, audio and seat controls — into that screen. There are still rows and banks of buttons (but not too many), all of which are easily identifiable and usable (except, perhaps, the ones Lexus and Toyota have for decades placed by your left knee). Get out of a new 7 Series or S-Class and into an LS, and you’ll immediately breathe a sigh of relief. Everything inside is intuitive and easy to operate; you won’t need a week’s worth of training to figure out how to operate the air vents or select a radio station. Some may say the LS feels old-fashioned by comparison, but perhaps it would be better described as “good-fashioned.” \n\nThe shapes and artistry of the interior are quite nice, even if the materials don’t feel much more premium than those in most vehicles these days. Lexus vehicles lost their “specialness” in this area a long time ago; really only the LC 500 coupe and convertible offer up cabins that can truly be called impressive. The LS isn’t too shabby, but my 500h’s interior could have been snazzier. The dour black upholstery made the whole cabin a somber affair, but brighter tan or white leather upholstery is available, and even a bright red interior can be had if you go for the F Sport model instead of the hybrid. Comfort is excellent, with supportive seats front and rear, along with excellent legroom. Headroom is a bit tight, however, and the cabin does feel a bit tighter overall than competitors’ — especially the limousine-like G90.\n\nThe Experience\n\nWhile the interior may be a bit behind the times, the powertrain doesn’t feel old. The LS 500h has a gas-electric hybrid system that uses a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, good for a total of 354 horsepower, while the gas-only LS 500 uses a 416-hp, twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6. The LS 500h hybrid has standard all-wheel drive and what Lexus calls a “multi-stage hybrid” transmission. It’s not a plug-in hybrid, so there’s no all-electric range or port to charge it, but the LS 500h allows for limited low-speed electric operation in certain environments, like parking lots. The hybrid system can also shut the engine down at cruising speeds for added efficiency — and efficiency is the name of the game with this model, along with smooth, quiet operation. With an EPA rating of 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined, fuel economy is decent for such a large vehicle. My week with the LS 500h, which included highway use between Detroit and Chicago, saw it net an impressive 30 mpg overall. \n\nAs you’d expect from a Lexus flagship, acceleration is quiet and creamy-smooth, coming on in a seamless rush that integrates the electric and gasoline systems quite well. Most other aspects of the LS are just as smooth, including braking operation, steering feel, ride quality and handling. It’s all appropriately muted and calm. \n\nOne foible occurs in lower-speed, around-town operation, where the transmission seems to hunt for the right combination of gas and electric integration, occasionally resulting in a confused surge that isn’t entirely what you called for. If you want a more athletic feel, there’s an F Sport option for the LS 500 but not for the LS 500h hybrid. This is a cruiser, not a bruiser, and it’s designed to provide a coddling, isolating experience, not a spirited one. \n\nThe LS works just fine for that: Comfort and serenity are its two main goals, followed by luxury and efficiency. It’s a fine flagship, even if its style and design might be a bit behind the latest and greatest. If you’re interested in a more traditional style of luxury isolationism, which Lexus made its bones delivering, the LS 500h is still a good choice. \n\nProblem Tech\n\nThis isn’t to say Lexus hasn’t been trying out some new technology on the LS. This car does have Lexus Teammate, a hands-free driving system in the vein of GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise. It debuted on the LS two years ago, and it’s standard on the 2024 LS 500h, but the system hasn’t shown up on any other offerings in Lexus showrooms just yet. Lexus Teammate is one of the most comprehensive systems on the market, with laser range finders, radar and a system of driver checks and status reports. It’s designed to allow users to let the vehicle operate hands-free on mapped roads at certain speeds, conditions permitting. I first experienced it three years ago at a Toyota event in Texas and came away with concerns about how well it worked, its intrusiveness and whether or not it actually delivered on its promise of creating a more relaxed driving experience. \n\nAs I stated then, “In a nutshell, Lexus Teammate is fussier, seemingly less trusting of the driver, and requires a significantly greater level of driver participation and monitoring in what is supposed to be a Level 2 semi-autonomous system.” That’s a direct comparison with competitors’ systems, including Super Cruise and BlueCruise. Simply put, GM’s Super Cruise remains the benchmark for these types of systems; it seemingly places far more trust in the car’s abilities than Lexus is willing to do. \n\nLexus describes its system as a driving aid, but it requires nearly the same amount of attention and involvement from a driver as it takes to drive a car yourself, right down to having to turn your head to check blind spots when using the semi-automated overtaking function. I tried using it again in the 2024 LS, and after several boneheaded maneuvers during a highway stint to Chicago — a few of which seriously rattled my passenger — I switched it off and didn’t bother with it again. In the three years since I drove a prototype of the system, it hasn’t been demonstrably improved over that initial software, whereas GM’s Super Cruise system continues to astound and amaze with its sophistication. The fact that this remains the only Toyotaverse vehicle to have hands-free cruise control might suggest just how well its development and rollout is going. (Which is to say, slowly.) \n\nThis really is the only tech problem in the LS. Its multimedia system works fine — it’s an uncomplicated system, perhaps not the most advanced one on the market, but that fits the theme of this car. It’s easy to use and learn, and its operation shouldn’t confuse older drivers . \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Lexus LX Line Adds Hybrid 700h, Off-Road Overtrail Trim\n2025 Lexus LC 500 Get More Bracing, Priced From $100,425\n2025 Lexus RX Adds Standard Equipment, Black Line Special Edition\nBack to Black: 2025 Lexus ES Priced From $43,190, Black Line Special Edition Returns\nShop for a 2024 Lexus LS 500h\nThe Bargain Flagship?\n\nPricing of the LS range is curious, as it starts considerably below all its direct competitors. A rear-wheel-drive LS 500 starts at $80,685 (all prices include destination fee), and pricing approaches $90,000 for an AWD F Sport model. That’s tens of thousands of dollars less than anything else in the full-size luxury sedan class: The Genesis G90 starts at $90,450, the Audi A8 starts a hair under $92,000, the base BMW 7 Series is $97,575, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class tops them all with its $118,900 base price. \n\nThe price gap between the conventional LS 500 and the LS 500h hybrid, however, is considerable: The hybrid starts at $115,560 — or nearly $35,000 more than a base LS 500. There are very few options; my test car came in at $119,380 thanks to some special metallic paint. All told, that’s a 48% premium over the base LS — which you’ll never recover in gas savings, making non-hybrid versions of the LS the more appealing ones. If you’re looking for a luxurious, quiet, easy-to-use and comfortable full-size sedan — at what amounts to a bargain price versus other luxury brand offerings — the LS should definitely be on your list. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Lexus chose to do light updates for the 2023 model year but focused on where it counts, with new technology leading the charge alongside a revised $77,535 starting price (all prices include a $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: The 2022 Lexus LS 500h Has a Hands-Free Driving System; We Try It\n\nLexus Adds New Tech to Give a Digital Edge\n\nAt first glance, you’d be hard-pressed to find any differences between model-year 2022 and 2023 versions of the LS 500 and LS 500h, with the bulk of the cars being largely carried over. However, slip inside and you’ll see an all-new 12.3-inch infotainment system that comes equipped with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as well as a voice command feature that can perform various tasks when prompted. This interface also pitches the old touchpad controller and is perhaps the closest the brand has come to matching the poise and usability offered by competitors. Lexus also threw in more USB ports to give occupants more places to charge their mobile devices when out on the move.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Lexus LS 500 and LS 500h will arrive in showrooms later this year. Rear-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive adds $3,250; the hybrid is AWD only. Full pricing for the lineup is below:\n\nLS 500: $77,535\nLS 500 F Sport: $81,135\nLS 500h: $113,435\n\nThe LS 500 continues to use a 416 horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. The 500h carries over its 3.5-liter V-6 that’s paired with two electric motors for a system total of 354 hp; it is also bundled with the Lexus Teammate driver-assistance system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2019 Lexus LS 500?\n2018 Lexus LS 500 and 500h: Our View\nWhich SUVs, Minivans and Sedans Have the Most Cargo Space?\nWhat’s New With Lexus for 2022?\nResearch the Lexus LS 500\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A decade since its last full redesign, the Lexus LS sedan is all-new, going on sale in February 2018 for roughly $75,000. The long-wheelbase version has been discontinued, but the LS 500h hybrid returns, now offering rear- as well as all-wheel drive, just like the regular LS 500. This review covers both vehicles.\n\nI drove three versions: an LS 500 with optional AWD, an F Sport version with standard RWD, and an LS 500h hybrid with RWD at a Lexus event in and around San Francisco. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging for such events.)\n\nBarrier to Entry\n\nThere’s something you’ll have to get past if you’re going to buy a Lexus LS, and it’s not the giant grille. Actually, you’ll have to get past that, too, but I think it’s a relatively low hurdle. A taller hurdle is the Remote Touch interface system, which comprises an impressively large, 12.3-inch mid-dashboard display and a touchpad controller on the center console. Historically, we’ve called this a multimedia system, but that term underrepresents its importance. It’s a foundational interface through which the driver controls many of the car’s features, and there are a lot of those in this car.\n\nProspective buyers have to accept the controls in any car, but I single this one out because it’s been one of the least popular among our editors and consumers. In lieu of a touchscreen (our preferred interface), some automakers separate the display from the means of controlling the onscreen menus — usually a rotary knob on the center console that also has a joystick motion and press-to-enter function. This isn’t a great way to get a cursor around a screen, but unfortunately, Lexus’ solutions to that problem — mouses and touchpads — have been controversial at best. We find the touchpads especially difficult to use when the car is in motion, but at least the generation in the new LS seems a little better than that in the RC coupe and NX SUV. It also helps that these cars are more docile and smoother-riding, so disruptions are fewer — but on the flip side, this car’s menus are more numerous and complex, so you’ll need to use Remote Touch more frequently. One step forward, one back.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDriving the LS shows how thoroughly reengineered it is in all its versions. The 2018 replaces the LS 460’s 4.6-liter V-8 engine with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. The switch boosts rather than hurts performance: The new LS 500 packs 416 horsepower versus the old V-8’s 386 hp. Torque is 442 pounds-feet at 1,600-4,800 rpm versus 367 pounds-feet at 4,100 rpm with the V-8. The 2018 also has two additional gears — a 10-speed automatic transmission — to get the most out of the engine. Lexus estimates a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.6 seconds with rear-wheel drive. That’s a full second quicker than the 2017 LS 460.\n\nDespite the specifications and the additional gears, the LS 500 doesn’t have quite the off-the-line immediacy one might expect. Still, it’s plenty quick once it gets going, and the drivetrain behaves very nicely. As automatic transmissions have added gears, they’ve too often been stricken with indecision and hesitation, but the Lexus 10-speed is admirably responsive whether you jab the accelerator pedal or operate the steering wheel’s shift paddles.\n\nDriving modes — selectable via a dashboard knob positioned at roughly 2 o’clock behind the steering wheel — include Eco, Normal, Comfort, Custom, Sport S and Sport S Plus. Accelerator pedal and downshifting sensitivity increase progressively with almost every step (Normal and Custom are the same in terms of acceleration, but the modes change other vehicle characteristics, as well). Engine sound also increases in the two sport modes, augmented through the audio system — another near-universal technique in the age of turbocharged engines. (BMW was the first.)\n\nIt’s unclear at this early stage which suspension features will be standard and which will be optional on the various trim levels, but all the cars I drove included Lexus’ air suspension (in lieu of coil springs) and variable-firmness shock absorbers, called Adaptive Variable Suspension. With these features, the LS is both comfortable and capable — a mix that isn’t ensured merely because the technology is present. To the contrary, Lexus is one of many non-European brands that spent years pursuing so-called European handling and ended up with cars that were neither as lavishly comfortable as the original LS nor as sporty as their benchmarks.\n\nWith these suspensions, the 2018 finally has it dialed in nicely, leaning toward the comfort you want in a large luxury sedan but with the option of enhanced sportiness for street driving. The front-to-rear weight distribution seems more balanced, and the steering has a very good feel on-center, recalling the LC 500. Body motions are well-controlled even without the optional active stabilizer bars, with which my F Sport was equipped. (The F Sport cornered remarkably flat, but I would have preferred if a tad more body roll were programmed in to make it feel more real and less like I was driving in a video game.)\n\nF Sport\n\nEven in the softer modes, like Comfort, the F Sport’s suspension is a bit firmer, but comfort remains the order of the day. Again recalling the LC 500, activating the Sport S and Sport S Plus settings on less-than-perfect pavement is more likely to introduce mild vibration than jarring bumps. Though the adaptive shock absorbers aren’t magnetic (arguably the best type), the new model year brings continuously variable firmness where the previous generations had just a few fixed levels.\n\nWhile the F Sport treatment is mostly cosmetic, in addition to the suspension differences this package replaces the standard four-piston front brake calipers and 14-inch rotors with six-piston calipers and 15.7-inch discs. The rear brakes go from two to four pistons and gain an inch of disc diameter, up to 14 inches.\n\nThe brakes were the most dramatic difference between the regular and F Sport versions of the LS 500. I had no problem with the standard setup, but I found the F Sport’s braking to be stronger and more confidence-inspiring for spirited driving, with superior pedal feel.\n\nA Real Hybrid\n\nThe most improved award goes to the LS hybrid, now dubbed the LS 500h, which for the first time provides what you might want from a hybrid — high gas mileage. (Duh!) The LS 600h L, last sold as a 2016, increased mileage by a whopping 1 and 2 mpg (combined) versus the rear- and all-wheel-drive non-hybrids, respectively, and it started at $121,415 versus $83,280 for an LS 460 L AWD. No amount of PR spin was able to head off our mockery of this vehicle.\n\nThe EPA hadn’t published estimates for the LS 500h as of publication, but Lexus estimates mileage of 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 23/31/26 mpg with AWD. That’s an enormous improvement over the 600h’s estimated 19/23/20 mpg (AWD only). It’s also a healthy increase over the non-hybrid LS 500’s mileage, which Lexus estimates at 19/29/23 mpg (RWD) and 18/27/21 mpg (AWD). These are respectable gains over the 2017 model’s combined ratings of 19 and 18 mpg for rear- and all-wheel drive, respectively. All the LS sedans require 91-octane premium gasoline.\n\nIf Lexus’ estimates are accurate, the LS 500 trails the less powerful 2018 BMW 740i by 1 to 2 mpg combined, depending on driveline, but beats the more powerful 750i by 2 to 3 mpg combined. As for hybrid competition, the BMW 740e — an all-wheel-drive plug-in hybrid — beats the LS 500h AWD by 1 mpg but trails the RWD version by 1 mpg. The BMW also goes an estimated 14 miles on electric power, but I wasn’t impressed when I reviewed it.\n\nHow does it drive? Quite well. It feels like the electric motor gives the 500h a little more oomph off the line, even though the hybrid system’s total power is 354 hp — less than the non-hybrid. Lexus estimates zero-to-60-mph times of 5.1 seconds (RWD) and 5.2 seconds (AWD).\n\nThere’s no question it’s a hybrid, as you’ll notice the non-turbocharged version of the 3.5-liter V-6 engine starting and stopping, and acceleration isn’t perfectly linear, though it feels more natural than, say, a Prius. The usual Toyota hybrid drivetrain — two motor/generators and a gas engine connected through a “power-split” gearset — has continuously variable properties that are efficient but may delay response or lead to engine drone at unexpected times.\n\nIn the 500h, those same components combine with what’s essentially a built-in four-speed transmission, and the system is programmed to add artificial rev-and-shift action, so the whole shebang feels like a 10-speed automatic. (Not exactly like one, but enough to quell complaints.) On some level, this extra hardware and stair-stepping diminishes efficiency a little, but it compensates by increasing driver acceptance a lot.\n\nIn the end, if you’re picky about acceleration and braking — which feels good but undeniably hybrid in the LS 500h — you’ll probably prefer the LS 500, but the 500h improves on drivability versus earlier hybrids.\n\n21st-Century Interior Design\n\nI find the cabin much improved, thanks especially to Lexus’ efforts to bring in new materials and textures. The technology will always be there, but if you want relatively conservative environs, you can get traditional glossy wood trim and the like.\n\nWhere the new LS really stands out is with optional ornamentation, such as gemlike Kiriko cut-glass door appliques whose facets complement aspects of the interior design, including the backlit, translucent panel in front of the passenger. The laser-etched wood does the same thing. Other patterned wood trim options, like Herringbone and Organic Art, recall the design innovation for which Audi is revered. I can’t emphasize enough that you must see these daring additions in person, because photos (including mine) all make them look louder and more conspicuous than they are in real life — none more so than the origami-inspired pleated-cloth door panels. It’s truly neat stuff to check out in person, and it’s exclusive to Lexus.\n\nThe extended-wheelbase LS is gone, but the backseat gained 2.2 inches of legroom over the LS 460. (The front seats lost 2.7 inches, but at 6 feet tall, I didn’t miss it a bit.) I had plenty of room in back, too, along with an optional touchscreen in the center armrest for controlling the rear climate zones, lighting, audio and more.\n\nI was duly impressed with the optional Executive Power Rear Seat with Ottoman. The motorized ballet as it reclines is just as appealing as it was in the BMW 7 Series, but Lexus has done a better job of keeping the front passenger seat from obstructing the driver’s view when it’s scooted forward. (The BMW even issues a warning to the driver as a precaution.)\n\nTechnology by Lexus, Not Apple\n\nLexus has stepped up its game with safety and convenience technology. One tech omission is that the LS isn’t compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The LS includes basic connectivity via two USB ports in front, and my test vehicles had two in the backseat armrest, as well, to charge mobile devices with a healthy 2.1 amps.\n\nMore ground is broken in the safety area. In addition to rear cross-traffic alert, which is becoming common in vehicles with blind spot warning, the LS adds the less common rear auto braking and pedestrian protection. Even more exclusive, the LS offers the same for the front of the car with the optional Advanced Package. With it, when you’re creeping into an intersection the LS alerts you to cars or pedestrians coming from either side.\n\nWhat really sells it is the optional, giant color head-up display image, which measures 24 inches wide by 6 inches high in the driver’s field of view. It flashes arrows showing which side has the threat, and the car can also brake automatically. The configurable HUD’s size allows it to show a wealth of other information, as well. If you like HUDs you’ll welcome this one, but its size probably won’t convert any detractors.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPrecise comparisons aren’t yet possible pending complete pricing information, but at “roughly $75,000,” according to Lexus, the LS 500 will continue to offer a price discount of about eight to 20 grand versus German competitors — more in line with the Jaguar XJ. It brings bold styling and distinctive Lexus character inside and out, and it’s more appealing that it’s been in many years.",

      "expert_review": "A decade since its last full redesign, the Lexus LS sedan is all-new, going on sale in February 2018 for roughly $75,000. The long-wheelbase version has been discontinued, but the LS 500h hybrid returns, now offering rear- as well as all-wheel drive, just like the regular LS 500. This review covers both vehicles.\n\nI drove three versions: an LS 500 with optional AWD, an F Sport version with standard RWD, and an LS 500h hybrid with RWD at a Lexus event in and around San Francisco. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging for such events.)\n\nBarrier to Entry\n\nThere’s something you’ll have to get past if you’re going to buy a Lexus LS, and it’s not the giant grille. Actually, you’ll have to get past that, too, but I think it’s a relatively low hurdle. A taller hurdle is the Remote Touch interface system, which comprises an impressively large, 12.3-inch mid-dashboard display and a touchpad controller on the center console. Historically, we’ve called this a multimedia system, but that term underrepresents its importance. It’s a foundational interface through which the driver controls many of the car’s features, and there are a lot of those in this car.\n\nProspective buyers have to accept the controls in any car, but I single this one out because it’s been one of the least popular among our editors and consumers. In lieu of a touchscreen (our preferred interface), some automakers separate the display from the means of controlling the onscreen menus — usually a rotary knob on the center console that also has a joystick motion and press-to-enter function. This isn’t a great way to get a cursor around a screen, but unfortunately, Lexus’ solutions to that problem — mouses and touchpads — have been controversial at best. We find the touchpads especially difficult to use when the car is in motion, but at least the generation in the new LS seems a little better than that in the RC coupe and NX SUV. It also helps that these cars are more docile and smoother-riding, so disruptions are fewer — but on the flip side, this car’s menus are more numerous and complex, so you’ll need to use Remote Touch more frequently. One step forward, one back.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDriving the LS shows how thoroughly reengineered it is in all its versions. The 2018 sedan replaces the LS 460’s 4.6-liter V-8 engine with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. The switch boosts rather than hurts performance: The new LS 500 packs 416 horsepower versus the old V-8’s 386 hp. Torque is 442 pounds-feet at 1,600-4,800 rpm versus 367 pounds-feet at 4,100 rpm with the V-8. The 2018 also has two additional gears — a 10-speed automatic transmission — to get the most out of the engine. Lexus estimates a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.6 seconds with rear-wheel drive. That’s a full second quicker than the 2017 LS 460.\n\nDespite the specifications and the additional gears, the Lexus LS 500 doesn’t have quite the off-the-line immediacy one might expect. Still, it’s plenty quick once it gets going, and the drivetrain behaves very nicely. As automatic transmissions have added gears, they’ve too often been stricken with indecision and hesitation, but the Lexus 10-speed is admirably responsive whether you jab the accelerator pedal or operate the steering wheel’s shift paddles.\n\nDriving modes — selectable via a dashboard knob positioned at roughly 2 o’clock behind the steering wheel — include Eco, Normal, Comfort, Custom, Sport S and Sport S Plus. Accelerator pedal and downshifting sensitivity increase progressively with almost every step (Normal and Custom are the same in terms of acceleration, but the modes change other vehicle characteristics, as well). Engine sound also increases in the two sport modes, augmented through the audio system — another near-universal technique in the age of turbocharged engines. (BMW was the first.)\n\nIt’s unclear at this early stage which suspension features will be standard and which will be optional on the new LS trim levels, but all the cars I drove included Lexus’ air suspension (in lieu of coil springs) and variable-firmness shock absorbers, called Adaptive Variable Suspension. With these features, the LS is both comfortable and capable — a mix that isn’t ensured merely because the technology is present. To the contrary, Lexus is one of many non-European brands that spent years pursuing so-called European handling and ended up with cars that were neither as lavishly comfortable as the original LS nor as sporty as their benchmarks.\n\nWith these suspensions, the 2018 finally has it dialed in nicely, leaning toward the comfort you want in a large luxury sedan but with the option of enhanced sportiness for street driving. The front-to-rear weight distribution seems more balanced, and the steering has a very good feel on-center, recalling the LC 500. Body motions are well-controlled even without the optional active stabilizer bars, with which my F Sport was equipped. (The F Sport cornered remarkably flat, but I would have preferred if a tad more body roll were programmed in to make it feel more real and less like I was driving in a video game.)\n\nF Sport\n\nEven in the softer modes, like Comfort, the F Sport’s suspension is a bit firmer, but comfort remains the order of the day. Again recalling the LC 500, activating the Sport S and Sport S Plus settings on less-than-perfect pavement is more likely to introduce mild vibration than jarring bumps. Though the adaptive shock absorbers aren’t magnetic (arguably the best type), the new model year brings continuously variable firmness where the previous generations had just a few fixed levels.\n\nWhile the F Sport treatment is mostly cosmetic, in addition to the suspension differences this package replaces the standard four-piston front brake calipers and 14-inch rotors with six-piston calipers and 15.7-inch discs. The rear brakes go from two to four pistons and gain an inch of disc diameter, up to 14 inches.\n\nThe brakes were the most dramatic difference between the regular and F Sport versions of the LS 500. I had no problem with the standard setup, but I found the F Sport’s braking to be stronger and more confidence-inspiring for spirited driving, with superior pedal feel.\n\nA Real Hybrid\n\nThe most improved award goes to the LS hybrid, now dubbed the LS 500h, which for the first time provides what you might want from a hybrid — high gas mileage. (Duh!) The LS 600h L, last sold as a 2016, increased mileage by a whopping 1 and 2 mpg (combined) versus the rear- and all-wheel-drive non-hybrids, respectively, and it started at $121,415 versus $83,280 for an LS 460 L AWD. No amount of PR spin was able to head off our mockery of this vehicle.\n\nThe EPA hadn’t published estimates for the LS 500h as of publication, but Lexus estimates fuel economy of 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 23/31/26 mpg with AWD. That’s an enormous improvement over the 600h’s estimated 19/23/20 mpg (AWD only). It’s also a healthy increase over the non-hybrid LS 500’s mileage, which Lexus estimates at 19/29/23 mpg (RWD) and 18/27/21 mpg (AWD). These are respectable gains over the 2017 model’s combined ratings of 19 and 18 mpg for rear- and all-wheel drive, respectively. All the LS sedans require 91-octane premium gasoline.\n\nIf Lexus’ estimates are accurate, the LS 500 trails the less powerful 2018 BMW 740i by 1 to 2 mpg combined, depending on driveline, but beats the more powerful 750i by 2 to 3 mpg combined. As for hybrid competition, the BMW 740e — an all-wheel-drive plug-in hybrid — beats the LS 500h AWD by 1 mpg but trails the RWD version by 1 mpg. The BMW also goes an estimated 14 miles on electric power, but I wasn’t impressed when I reviewed it.\n\nHow does it drive? Quite well. It feels like the electric motor gives the 500h a little more oomph off the line, even though the hybrid system’s total power is 354 hp — less than the non-hybrid. Lexus estimates zero-to-60-mph times of 5.1 seconds (RWD) and 5.2 seconds (AWD).\n\nThere’s no question it’s a hybrid, as you’ll notice the non-turbocharged version of the 3.5-liter V-6 engine starting and stopping, and acceleration isn’t perfectly linear, though it feels more natural than, say, a Prius. The usual Toyota hybrid drivetrain — two motor/generators and a gas engine connected through a “power-split” gearset — has continuously variable properties that are efficient but may delay response or lead to engine drone at unexpected times.\n\nIn the 500h, those same components combine with what’s essentially a built-in four-speed transmission, and the system is programmed to add artificial rev-and-shift action, so the whole shebang feels like a 10-speed automatic. (Not exactly like one, but enough to quell complaints.) On some level, this extra hardware and stair-stepping diminishes efficiency a little, but it compensates by increasing driver acceptance a lot.\n\nIn the end, if you’re picky about acceleration and braking — which feels good but undeniably hybrid in the LS 500h — you’ll probably prefer the LS 500, but the 500h improves on drivability versus earlier hybrids.\n\n21st-Century Interior Design\n\nI find the cabin much improved, thanks especially to Lexus’ efforts to bring in new materials and textures. The technology will always be there, but if you want relatively conservative environs, you can get traditional glossy wood trim and the like.\n\nWhere the new LS really stands out is with optional ornamentation, such as gemlike Kiriko cut-glass door appliques whose facets complement aspects of the interior design, including the backlit, translucent panel in front of the passenger. The laser-etched wood does the same thing. Other patterned wood trim options, like Herringbone and Organic Art, recall the design innovation for which Audi is revered. I can’t emphasize enough that you must see these daring additions in person, because photos (including mine) all make them look louder and more conspicuous than they are in real life — none more so than the origami-inspired pleated-cloth door panels. It’s truly neat stuff to check out in person, and it’s exclusive to Lexus.\n\nThe extended-wheelbase LS is gone, but the backseat gained 2.2 inches of legroom over the LS 460. (The front seats lost 2.7 inches, but at 6 feet tall, I didn’t miss it a bit.) I had plenty of room in back, too, along with an optional touchscreen in the center armrest for controlling the rear climate zones, lighting, audio and more.\n\nI was duly impressed with the optional Executive Power Rear Seat with Ottoman. The motorized ballet as it reclines is just as appealing as it was in the BMW 7 Series, but Lexus has done a better job of keeping the front passenger seat from obstructing the driver’s view when it’s scooted forward. (The BMW even issues a warning to the driver as a precaution.)\n\nTechnology by Lexus, Not Apple\n\nLexus has stepped up its game with safety and convenience technology. One tech omission is that the LS isn’t compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The LS includes basic connectivity via two USB ports in front, and my test vehicles had two in the backseat armrest, as well, to charge mobile devices with a healthy 2.1 amps.\n\nMore ground is broken in the safety area. In addition to rear cross-traffic alert, which is becoming common in vehicles with blind spot warning, the LS adds the less common rear auto braking and pedestrian protection. Even more exclusive, the LS offers the same for the front of the car with the optional Advanced Package. With it, when you’re creeping into an intersection the LS alerts you to cars or pedestrians coming from either side.\n\nWhat really sells it is the optional, giant color head-up display image, which measures 24 inches wide by 6 inches high in the driver’s field of view. It flashes arrows showing which side has the threat, and the car can also brake automatically. The configurable HUD’s size allows it to show a wealth of other information, as well. If you like HUDs you’ll welcome this one, but its size probably won’t convert any detractors.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPrecise comparisons aren’t yet possible pending complete pricing information, but at “roughly $75,000,” according to Lexus, the LS 500 will continue to offer a price discount of about eight to 20 grand versus German competitors — more in line with the Jaguar XJ. It brings bold styling and distinctive Lexus character inside and out, and it’s more appealing that it’s been in many years.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus LS?\n\nThe five-seat LS 500 is Lexus’ flagship full-size luxury sedan. It’s powered by a 416-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that drives a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, along with a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain in the 354-hp LS 500h. The LS competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Genesis G90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus LS?\n\nAll models get a new 12.3-inch touchscreen, and numerous refinements have been made to the suspension, interior and conventional and hybrid drivetrains to improve ride quality, passenger comfort and performance. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus LS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nHands-free power trunk lid\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats \nPower rear sunshade \nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking \nLane departure warning with steering assist\nFull-speed adaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic glass roof \nAir suspension \nHead-up display \nHeated rear seats \nPower-adjustable massaging rear seats\nMark Levinson premium stereo\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus LS?\n\nThe LS is less expensive than its German luxury competitors, but the Genesis G90’s starting price undercuts it a little. If you’re looking for eco-friendliness in a large luxury sedan, the LS 500h’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is impressive. Lexus’ Remote Touch multimedia controller remains frustrating to use, which makes the new touchscreen all the more welcome.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus LS?\n\nThe five-seat LS 500 is Lexus’ flagship full-size luxury sedan. It’s powered by a 416-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 that drives a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, along with a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain in the LS 500h. The LS competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Genesis G90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus LS?\n\nA limited-edition Inspiration Series joins the LS lineup. It features Deep Garnet exterior paint, 20-inch black-chrome wheels, a white semi-aniline leather interior, Kiriko glass trim and a Mark Levinson premium stereo. Only 300 Inspiration Series LS sedans will be produced. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus LS Are Most Important?\n\nThe LS reminds you it’s a no-compromises luxury sedan by offering standard features like a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, a power rear sunshade, navigation with a 12.3-inch screen, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and a hands-free power trunk lid. Options include a panoramic glass roof, an air suspension, a head-up display, heated rear seats and power-adjustable rear seats with a massage function. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus LS?\n\nThe LS is less expensive than its German luxury competitors, but its starting price is similar to the G90’s. Ride quality is controlled, while the steering is direct.  If you’re looking for eco-friendliness in a large luxury sedan, it’s worth noting that the LS 500h’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is impressive. Unfortunately, the Remote Touch multimedia controller continues to be frustrating to use; be sure to test the system thoroughly before buying.",
