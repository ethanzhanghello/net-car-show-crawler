      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus UX?\n\nThe Lexus UX is a five-seat subcompact luxury SUV. Its hybrid powertrain uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a pair of electric motors to generate 196 horsepower. All-wheel-drive models add a third electric motor to drive the rear wheels in a setup that’s lighter and more efficient than mechanical AWD. The front-drive UX earns an impressive EPA-rated 45/41/43 mpg city/highway/combined, while the AWD version is rated 44/40/42 mpg. The UX’s rivals include the BMW X1 and X2, the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class and the Volvo XC40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus UX?\n\nFor 2025, the UX gets a new hybrid powertrain that’s both more powerful and slightly more efficient than its predecessor, necessitating a name change from UX 250h to UX 300h. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster is newly available, and more advanced safety tech is standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus UX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB-C ports\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nForward collision warning\nPedestrian detection\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nEmergency steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nLED fog lights\nFoot-activated power liftgate\n10-speaker stereo\nDigital key\nMoonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nRain-sensing wipers\nHead-up display\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus UX?\n\nWith its excellent build quality, lengthy roster of standard features, great fuel economy and maneuverable size, the Lexus UX is a solid buy. That size does, however, come with compromises, including backseat space and cargo room. Shoppers without children will likely find nothing to complain about — unless you have taller passengers you’ll have to ask to fold into the backseat.",
