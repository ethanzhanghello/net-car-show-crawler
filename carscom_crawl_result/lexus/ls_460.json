      "expert_review": "The first Lexus LS 400 was a groundbreaking car when it appeared in 1989, and the luxury segment hasn’t been the same since.\n\nThe current car is the fourth-generation LS, and in many ways it is just as significant as the first car in terms of defining the brand. The LS 460 has a magic-carpet ride. It has an uncanny smoothness regardless of the road surface, yet it handles with precision. The 380-horsepower V-8 can return in excess of 24 mpg at highways speeds.\n\nFor 2009, Lexus will offer all-wheel drive. All-wheel-drive versions have a drivetrain that is almost identical to the one used on the hybrid LS600h. A Torsen limited-slip differential distributes drive torque between the front and rear wheels. The front-to-rear bias is set at 40:60, but it can change to 30:70 depending on conditions. All-wheel-drive versions will come standard with air suspension, variable-gear-ratio steering and adaptive variable suspension.\n\nThe LS is available in two sizes, and all-wheel drive is optional on either. The standard model has a 116.9-inch wheelbase while the LS 460L has a 121.7-inch wheelbase. The long wheelbase provides extra length for a reclining rear seat that “transports its rear-seat passengers in an environment whose luxury features closely resemble those of a private jet,” according to Lexus press materials.\n\nThe test car was a 2008 LS 460L, and its base price was $72,000.\n\nPrices for 2009 start at $63,675 for the standard model and $67,200 for all-wheel drive. The long-wheelbase model begins at $73,585 while one with all-wheel drive starts at $77,110.\n\nAs you would expect from a car in this segment, the LS 460 is loaded with technology. The butter-smooth V-8 cranks out 380 horsepower, and it’s mated to the industry’s first eight-speed automatic transmission. The LS can also be equipped with a self-parking system.\n\nThe engine is all new, and it combines both port and direct fuel injection. Electric motors control the variable valve timing and electronic intake cam. Lexus said it is the first to use such a design. To reduce friction and vibration, parts of the crankshaft are polished mirror-smooth. During assembly, the engine is cranked by an electric motor as technicians measure for vibration.\n\nAccording to Lexus, the paint process is a story in itself. The company invented six-axis robots, capable of three-dimensional movements, to polish the body before paint is applied. It took six months just to devise the software to make them work. Then, as successive layers of paint go on, the car is hand-sanded twice.\n\nAttention to detail is evident when you slide behind the wheel. Out on the road, the LS is as quiet as a football stadium on Monday and as serene as Queen Elizabeth. It rolls so smoothly you would swear the wheels are hardly touching the ground.\n\nBut don’t let the smoothness fool you. Stamp the throttle and the LS accelerates with authority, more like a sports car than a luxury sedan. That level of performance is certainly different from earlier models that were spirited, but not quite like this.\n\nThe LS 460 is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds. The engine meets standards for ultra-low-emissions vehicles and is rated at 19 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway. That’s excellent for a car of this size and with this much horsepower.\n\nInside, the cabin’s elegance is understated. The leather seats are deep and cozy, and they have a wide range of adjustment. They are, of course, heated and cooled. The optional power rear seat is heated and has a memory setting.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com",

      "expert_review": "Let me start by saying: I have long considered the Lexus flagship sedan to be the uber four-door model in the luxury passenger car segment.\nI thought so when it was called the Lexus LS 400. Ditto when it became the Lexus LS 430.\nBut with the new-for-2007 Lexus LS 460, I’m not so sure.\nDon’t get me wrong. The tested LS 460 L — with the “L” designating the long-wheelbase edition of the sedan — is a spectacular car. It’s a sweet-driving, powerful, technologically mind-blowing masterpiece of automotive engineering.\nBut packed with so many techno marvels and starting at an eye-popping $71,000, the top-of-the-line four-door Lexus now feels like it has stepped up to some higher plane … out of reach of the mainstream car buyer.\nYes, the more-basic 2007 LS 460 starts at $61,000, but even it appears galaxies removed from the good old days when a flagship Lexus sedan was priced in the $50,000s.\nAlas, times change. Things get bigger, better. And this is the luxury segment we’re talking about. So, like it or not, the Lexus LS 460 is what it is.\nFor those who can afford the hefty fare, rest assured that you’ll be getting an extraordinary machine.\nHow extraordinary? I’m sure many of you have heard the stories by now. They’re all true.\nYes, the tester can park itself — back-in and parallel — thanks to the amazing Advanced Parking Guidance System. The exotic option employs a back-up camera, sonar sensors and electric power steering to pull off this magic trick.\nThe Lexus has a world-first eight-speed automatic transmission. In my weeklong ride, it functioned well but occasionally seemed momentarily lost when I made quick throttle adjustments during crowded freeway commutes.\nOtherwise, the sedan drove like a Boeing 747 on a cloudless, dead-calm day … which is to say it was rock-solid and buttery smooth. Cruising at 70 miles per hour felt like 40 mph.\nThe 4.6-liter, 380-horsepower V-8 engine is not a dragster-style power plant, but it’s instantly responsive and delivers strong rear-drive acceleration when the revs are up. Steering is light but firm.\nIf you’re going to pay $71,000 for a car, you want an extensive list of standard goodies. Lexus does not disappoint on this score.\nBesides the usual power-leather-everything one expects from Toyota’s high-end division, the monster list of standard features on the tester included electronic brake force distribution, automatic electronic parking brake, auto-leveling headlamps with high-intensity beams, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated exterior mirrors, voice-activated navigation system, back-up camera, rear heated seats, power trunk lid, heated steering wheel, headlamp washers … I could go on and on, but I have to finish this review today.\nInterior comfort is exquisite; the nearly 122-inch wheelbase on the LS 460 L translates to plenty of leg room.\nEven at high speed, the cabin is reading-room quiet. Besides the no-hands parking system, the tested LS 460 L had extras that included power/cooled rear seats and an absolutely kickin’ Mark Levinson surround-sound audio system with — I kid you not — 19 speakers\nOpulent? This thing’s a Four Seasons hotel on four wheels.\nPricey? With options, the sticker’s bottom line on my test car read $79,125.\nTechnology-laden? I need another week in the car, because I didn’t get halfway through the LS 460 L’s 650-page owner’s manual.\nWell, I guess my biggest gripe with this luxury liner is that it now seems so far out of reach for — how can I say this? — the rest of us.\nBut last time I looked, it’s no crime to sell a dazzling, pocketbook-crushing car in this nation. And to be sure, there are plenty of other cars on the road with even higher prices.For those fortunate enough to afford this new level of Lexus luxury, I salute you. And, yeah, I envy you, too.\n  2007 Lexus LS 460 at a glance\nMake/model: Lexus LS 460 L  Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, rear-drive, long-wheelbase luxury sedan  Base price: $71,000 (as tested, $79,125)  Engine: 4.6-liter V-8 with 380 horsepower at 6,400 revolutions per minute and 367 foot-pounds of torque at 4,100 rpm  EPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city; 27 mpg highway (premium unleaded required),br> Transmission: Eight-speed automatic with overdrive  Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion  Brakes: Four-wheel, ventilated discs with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features  Suspension: Independent, multi-link on front and rear  Fuel tank: 22.2 gallons  Passenger volume: 103 cubic feet  Maximum cargo volume: 18 cubic feet (12 cubic feet when equipped with rear air-conditioning system)   Curb weight: 4,332 pounds  Height: 57.7 inches  Length: 202.8 inches  Wheelbase: 121.7 inches  Width: 73.8 inches  Track: 63.5 inches on front; 63.7 inches on rear  Ground clearance: 6.1 inches   Tires: P235/50R18 all-season radials  Port of entry: Long Beach",

      "expert_review": "Lexus’ attempt to turn the 2013 Lexus LS 460 into a sporty limo was only somewhat successful, for in the translation to an F-Sport model, the regular LS 460’s opulence was lost to a cold functionality that seems out of place in a Lexus flagship.\n\nWhen the original Lexus LS 400 debuted in 1989, it turned the luxury car market on its head. It looked better than any Cadillac, proved more reliable than any Mercedes-Benz and cost less than almost any of its competitors. That LS and successive Lexus models propelled the brand to the top of the U.S. luxury sales market for nearly a decade.\n\nNow, the fifth-generation Lexus LS 460 attempts to inject a little spice into a marque known for high-quality vanilla with the first-ever F-Sport model of its top sedan. F-Sport comes as an option package with either rear- or all-wheel drive on the regular LS 460, but is not available on the extended LS 460L. See the updated LS 460 compared with the 2012 model here.\n\nStyling\nThe most obvious update to the new 2013 Lexus LS 460 is up front. Love it or loathe it, the Lexus family spindle grille has arrived. The F-Sport Package on our test vehicle adds more aggressive elements, including a black honeycomb grille insert with larger air intakes in the lower bumper that incorporate LED fog lights. Combined with the 19-inch, multispoke gray alloy wheels and a lower stance, it looks more menacing than a standard LS 460. It’s hard to make a silver car stand out, but our car’s impressive Liquid Platinum color positively glowed at nearly any time of day, setting off the subtle curves of the sedate bodywork. Still, the LS’ shape is not going to grab anyone’s attention, but the Lexus buyer has never truly been interested in that kind of notoriety to begin with, so that matters little.\n\nPowertrain\nLexus has always excelled at delivering massive thrust with minimal drama, and the LS 460 F-Sport is no different, hustling through traffic in near silence. It only makes the 4.6-liter V-8’s presence known when the driver plants a foot to call up all the engine’s abilities. The V-8 engine makes a robust 360 horsepower in AWD versions, like my test car, while rear-wheel-drive cars enjoy a higher 386 hp — a significant difference that should make the lighter rear-drive car even quicker.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission is gelato-smooth with practically imperceptible shifts, making the LS feel almost like a single-gear electric car. The F-Sport Package includes transmission paddle shifters behind the steering wheel that will almost certainly never be used more than once by any owner — and that likely only during the initial test drive. The full-time AWD on our tester worked seamlessly when morning snow showers coated local roads in ice.\n\nThe F-Sport Package brings with it a host of advanced components meant to make the Lexus LS 460 F Sport more “engaging,” to use Lexus’ word. Chief among them is an adjustable air suspension, with six driver-selectable modes that include Eco, Comfort, Normal, Sport S, Sport S+ and Snow. In Normal mode, the LS rides and handles as one would expect it to, which is to say, like it has since Day One in 1989: like a big, plush yacht of a car whose goal is to isolate drivers from their external environment, not involve them in it. Switching to Comfort mode only brings more of this isolation, ironing out road imperfections so they can only be heard through the big wheels and tires, not actually felt. Eco changes the throttle and transmission pattern to create a more relaxed response regardless of how you’re actually driving, a provision designed to use less fuel.\n\nMoving the dial into Sport modes changes a few settings throughout the car. Sport S mode remaps the transmission and throttle response, making for slightly more responsive acceleration. With Sport S+, the same things happen, plus the steering and suspension firm up — but only marginally so, perhaps most notably at highway speeds, as steering effort rises and the car feels more planted. But in twisty switchbacks, the firmer settings cannot mask the fact that there is a lot of mass being thrown around. The selector button doesn’t magically transform the smooth, sedate LS 460 into a snarling Porsche Panamera, not even in the most aggressive Sport S+ mode. Most drivers will find the differences to be minor, with the gauge cluster’s change from blue to red lighting the only real indication. The brakes are a strong point, however, with massive six-piston, black-painted brake calipers that provide excellent feel and bring the big LS to a stop with little drama and a lot of confidence.\n\nInterior\nWhile the F-Sport Package’s exterior changes are generally positive, the same cannot be said for the inside. The package replaces the real wood trim in the base and hybrid LS 600h with stamped metal trim, made from real aluminum and piano black lacquer, presumably made from real pianos. Black leather covers the seats and doors, with white piping and perforations on the seating surfaces.\n\nBut what comes across as modern and opulent in wood comes across as dark and dull in aluminum. Arguably the best interior color combination comes in the LS 600h L long-wheelbase hybrid, which can be had with a light bamboo wood trim that contrasts beautifully with the black upper instrument panel and available flaxen (tan) leather seats and doors. These colors emphasize the dramatic shapes and cut-lines of the interior panels, evoking a modern Danish furniture aesthetic that is truly attractive. Unfortunately, it does so in a $120,805 hybrid that gets 23 mpg on the highway — the same highway mileage as the all-wheel Lexus LS 460 and 1 mpg worse than the rear-drive version.\n\nFeatures\nThe driver can control entertainment and other functions through a massive 12.3-inch display panel that is surprisingly not a touch-screen. It’s controlled by a joystick on the center console that requires the user to lay a hand on a handrest and move a cursor around the screen via a fingertip selector. Having to remotely move a cursor around on the screen adds an extra step to the process, which during a more complicated action — like hunting for a song or playlist on an iPod — becomes frustrating.\n\nThe benefits are a screen that never gets smudged by fingerprints (because you’re not touching it) that’s located high up in the dash to minimize the time your eyes are off the road. The on-screen graphics, however, are shockingly behind the times, featuring a clarity and sophistication that appears two generations behind the best systems on the market, and one generation behind graphics in mass-market brands like Ford and Buick. Controls for climate control and audio systems still have some dedicated buttons, however, meaning use of the electronic display screen can be minimized. Voice controls work well — and quickly, too — with flawless on-the-fly navigation operation in my first attempt, something other brands struggle to do.\n\nA 19-speaker premium Mark Levinson sound system can replace the standard 10-speaker system as a stand-alone option, but I found it to be oddly biased toward the center channel speakers in all modes. I was also surprised at how it struggled to hit high-end frequencies, particularly in vocal performances. In short, the electronic features offered in the top-of-the-line Lexus flagship struggle to outperform systems now common in mass-market compacts, which is either a testament to how much these systems have trickled down into lesser vehicles, or a statement on how much work Lexus has in front of it to remain a leader in the field.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, only a frontal crash test has been conducted on the 2013 LS, by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in which it received the top mark of Good. Additional tests by IIHS and the federal government will likely come later. Airbags abound in the Lexus LS 460, including front knee bags, side airbags and side curtain airbags. As is required in all new cars starting with the 2012 model year, the LS has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nLexus also has an available electronic pre-collision system with Collision Avoidance Assist. The system helps detect obstacles and can even brake the car to a full stop from 24 mph on its own.\n\nFor full specs and safety equipment listings, click here.\n\nIn the Market\nThe LS luxury sedan range starts at $72,885 for a basic rear-wheel-drive model and stretches up to an eye-popping $120,805 for the long-wheelbase LS 600h hybrid (all prices include destination charges). Our AWD model started at $75,830 but added blind spot monitoring, the Mark Levinson sound system, a cargo net and a trunk mat, along with the F-Sport Comfort Package, which includes heated and cooled front seats, a power rear sunshade, power-opening and closing trunk, and heated rear seats. The F-Sport Package itself included 19-inch, 10-spoke wheels, an adaptive air suspension, black leather interior, paddle shifters, and the interior and exterior styling changes mentioned earlier. All that brought the total for our tester to $88,029.\n\nUnlike earlier LS generations, which undercut the European flagships, this Lexus LS 460 is priced close to other luxury brands’ top offerings, including the BMW 7 Series, the Audi A8 and even the Jaguar XJ. All those are better-handling driver’s cars that offer considerably more choices in everything from powertrains to exterior colors. One hesitates to include the Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the competitor set, however, seeing how its base price is nearly $20,000 higher, at $93,255. Click here to compare the Lexus LS 460 with its competitors.\n\nOriginally meant to compete with these models head-to-head, the big Lexus simply hasn’t kept pace with the technology or exclusive feel of the German body-type counterparts that it once upset. The same formula is applied today as it was nearly 25 years ago — a big, quiet, cushy, V-8-powered sedan that does things well and with minimal drama, but whose main goal is isolation and precision, not passion or ostentation. One buys the Lexus LS for the same reason one buys an Omega watch — it’s still a luxury item, just not the craziest, most expensive one of its kind. It’s highly competent, but not likely to get noticed — for better or for worse.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLexus’ flagship LS 460 full-size sedan is available in standard form and as a limousine-like long-wheelbase LS 460 L model that stretches nearly 203 inches from bumper to bumper — 5 inches more than the standard model. Competitors include the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. An optional Advanced Parking Guidance System lets the car park itself and is the car’s most intriguing feature. A hybrid version of the LS 460 L sedan, dubbed LS 600h L, is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2009\nLexus adds an all-wheel-drive version for both regular and extended-wheelbase trims of the LS 460 for 2009.\n\nExterior\nEach new Lexus becomes incrementally more sculpted, with market pressure by more adventurous competitors eroding the company’s traditionally conservative lines. The LS features an aerodynamically laid-back grille, headlights and windshield, with the hint of a BMW trunk at the rear.\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nHigh-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable 19-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nIn the long-wheelbase variant, Lexus aims to replicate the environment of a business jet with optional massaging, 45-degree-reclining rear seats that include an ottoman for leg support.

      "expert_review": "The best way to test the 2010 Lexus LS 460L is in the backseat.\n\nFor once, let someone else do the driving. Adjust your seat, plug in a movie, spread some Grey Poupon on your sandwich and you’ll be surprised how fast you get there.\n\nThe executive class seating package (a $13,200 option) provides just about everything a Wall Street tycoon would want: leg rests, reclining seat and a delicate massager.\n\nThe wood trim in the back is nicer than the furniture most people have in their home. Even the air the passenger breathes is better than what we unwashed masses have to suck down on a daily basis. This vehicle has an air purifier.\n\nSo there are you, breathing your filtered air, drinking your filtered bubbly water (your faithful driver would have to provide you with that), watching your movie or listening to Mark Levinson surround sound stereo with 19 speakers, the bright sun blocked from your eyes with the electric shades on the rear doors and back, as tiny electric motors massage your back. It almost makes you want to become a tycoon of some sort just to enjoy some of the finer luxuries in life.\n\nYou don’t even have to worry if the LS 460L can park itself or not; it can. The driver takes care of those details.\n\nOf course, he or she will be pretty happy cruising in the flagship for the No. 1 luxury brand in the United States. The car’s 4.6-liter V-8 lets the driver blast off with 380 horsepower and 367 pound-feet of torque. (The all-wheel drive model drops its power to 357 horsepower and 344 pound-feet of torque.)\n\nThe driver can get this big boy rolling at 60 mph in under six seconds, another impressive performance number. (It has a top speed of 130 mph, which is electronically limited.)\n\nThey may not like the electric power steering though, which is rather loose and a little numb, especially at slower speeds, but it seems to tighten up nicely when cruising on the highway.\n\nIf they get lost and you haven’t fired them, they can use the optional navigation system, which includes a large color LCD screen on the dash.\n\nReally, the driver will like just about every feature in the front. There’s Bluetooth connections for your assistant to place phone calls and set up appointments. Everything is laid out nicely and the seats are extremely comfortable up front too, though they lack any massage features (something the help doesn’t need access too anyway).\n\nThe driver already has a tilting, telescoping steering wheel and an electric seat that moves back slightly when the car is stopped to make ingress and egress easier. (This is also important so he can get your door even faster.)\n\nThere are also new telematics this year in the LS 460L. The system is called Lexus Enform with Safety Connect. This system includes a response center and works similar to General Motors Co.’s OnStar system.\n\nRefreshed look\n\nFor the 2010 model year, Lexus refreshed the new sedan’s look. It changed the front fascia, replaced the headlights and tail lamps.\n\nThe look remains understated with a wide grille and overall solid, well-proportioned stance. It’s the vehicle of dignitaries or, at least, apprentices fired by Donald Trump — though I don’t know if they still get whisked away engulfed in that much luxury.\n\nThere’s a graceful curve to the car’s roofline and thick d pillar, which just makes this car look elegant. People may not be able to identify the car by name, but they will know it’s expensive. (It starts at $73,750; my test vehicle included more than $22,000 in options and sticker price over $95,000.)\n\nBut if you’ve got the money, flaunt it. At least that’s what a Lexus dealer might suggest.\n\nNo bumps\n\nThe ride from the backseat is superb. You’re not likely to spill any coffee on your Armani suit because the optional air suspension will eat up any big bump. The LS 460L is also extremely quiet.\n\nNow, to address the elephant in the other backseat. Yes, Toyota Motor Corp. has had a tough time this year.\n\nAnd yes, Lexus announced Friday that it will recall some LS 460s for a steering problem.\n\nMy advice: Have your driver take your LS 460L to a Lexus dealer and have them give it a good going over.\n\nWhile the recent Toyota recalls have cooled the carmaker’s bright star, only a fool would underestimate this company. And after getting a taste of what Detroit has gone through for decades, my guess is the company is going to do everything it can to avoid having similar problems in the future. We all hit rough patches, and we learn to get over them too.\n\nLexus still makes good cars. The LS 460L is proof of that. Even from the back seat, I can see that.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLexus’ flagship LS 460 full-size sedan is available in standard form and as a limousine-like long-wheelbase LS 460 L model that stretches nearly 204 inches from bumper to bumper — 5 inches more than the standard model. The LS can seat up to five people, and both sizes are available with rear- or all-wheel drive. Competitors include the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. An optional Advanced Parking Guidance System lets the car park itself and is one of the car’s most intriguing features.\n\nA hybrid version of the LS 460 L sedan, dubbed LS 600h L, is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2012\nAn LS Sport Authentic Special Edition is new for 2012. Based on the regular-wheelbase rear-wheel-drive LS 460, the model includes 19-inch forged alloy wheels with summer tires, Brembo brakes, a sport-tuned air suspension, a unique grille, power door closers, paddle shifters, front sport seats, a black and topaz interior color scheme, and a navigation system. Production is limited to 250 copies.\n\nExterior\nThe side mirrors have integrated turn signals, and the standard 18-inch wheels have a 10-spoke design. Exterior features include:\n\n\nXenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nPower moonroof\nAvailable 19-inch wheels\nAvailable power rear sunshade\n\n\nInterior\nIn the long-wheelbase variant, Lexus aims to replicate the environment of a business jet with an optional massaging 45-degree-reclining rear seat that includes an ottoman for leg support. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable voice-activated navigation system\nAvailable 19-speaker Mark Levinson stereo\nAvailable rear flip-down DVD screen on long-wheelbase models\nLong-wheelbase model offers an optional Executive Class Seating Package with a reclining right-side rear seat, a rear center console with a tray table, ventilation controls and a drink cooler\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 4.6-liter V-8 engine uses direct fuel injection along with traditional port fuel injection. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n380-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 with 367 pounds-feet of torque (rear-wheel drive)\n357-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 with 344 pounds-feet of torque (all-wheel drive)\nEight-speed automatic transmission\nElectronic power steering\nAvailable air suspension with selectable comfort modes\n\n\nSafety\nThe optional Advanced Pre-Collision System, which helps detect pedestrians and apply strong braking power, is available with a camera that monitors the orientation of the driver’s face. It can activate warnings if the driver isn’t looking ahead for more than a few seconds. Other safety features include:\n\n\nElectronically controlled antilock brakes with brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nFront knee airbags\nAvailable rear-seat side-impact airbags\nAvailable backup camera with navigation system",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2013 about the 2013 Lexus LS 460. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLexus’ attempt to turn the 2013 LS 460 into a sporty limo was only somewhat successful, for in the translation to an F-Sport model, the regular LS 460’s opulence was lost to a cold functionality that seems out of place in a Lexus flagship.\n\nWhen the original Lexus LS 400 debuted in 1989, it turned the luxury car market on its head. It looked better than any Cadillac, proved more reliable than any Mercedes-Benz and cost less than almost any of its competitors. That LS and successive Lexus models propelled the brand to the top of the U.S. luxury sales market for nearly a decade.\n\nNow, the fifth-generation LS 460 attempts to inject a little spice into a marque known for high-quality vanilla with the first-ever F-Sport model of its top sedan. F-Sport comes as an option package with either front- or all-wheel drive on the regular LS 460, but is not available on the extended LS 460L. See the updated LS 460 compared with the 2012 model here.\n\nStyling\nThe most obvious update to the new 2013 LS 460 is up front. Love it or loathe it, the Lexus family spindle grille has arrived. The F-Sport Package on our test vehicle adds more aggressive elements, including a black honeycomb grille insert with larger air intakes in the lower bumper that incorporate LED fog lights. Combined with the 19-inch, multispoke gray wheels and a lower stance, it looks more menacing than a standard LS 460. It’s hard to make a silver car stand out, but our car’s impressive Liquid Platinum color positively glowed at nearly any time of day, setting off the subtle curves of the sedate bodywork. Still, the LS’ shape is not going to grab anyone’s attention, but the Lexus buyer has never truly been interested in that kind of notoriety to begin with, so that matters little.\n\nPowertrain\nLexus has always excelled at delivering massive thrust with minimal drama, and the LS 460 F-Sport is no different, hustling through traffic in near silence. It only makes the 4.6-liter V-8’s presence known when the driver plants a foot to call up all the engine’s abilities. The V-8 engine makes a robust 360 horsepower in all-wheel-drive versions, like my test car, while rear-wheel-drive cars enjoy a higher 386 hp — a significant difference that should make the lighter rear-drive car even quicker.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission is gelato-smooth with practically imperceptible shifts, making the LS feel almost like a single-gear electric car. The F-Sport Package includes transmission paddle shifters behind the steering wheel that will almost certainly never be used more than once by any owner — and that likely only during the initial test drive. The full-time all-wheel drive on our tester worked seamlessly when morning snow showers coated local roads in ice.\n\nThe F-Sport Package brings with it a host of advanced components meant to make the LS 460 more “engaging,” to use Lexus’ word. Chief among them is an adjustable air suspension, with six driver-selectable modes that include Eco, Comfort, Normal, Sport S, Sport S+ and Snow. In Normal mode, the LS rides and handles as one would expect it to, which is to say, like it has since Day One in 1989: like a big, plush yacht of a car whose goal is to isolate drivers from their external environment, not involve them in it. Switching to Comfort mode only brings more of this isolation, ironing out road imperfections so they can only be heard through the big wheels and tires, not actually felt. Eco changes the throttle and transmission pattern to create a more relaxed response regardless of how you’re actually driving, a provision designed to use less fuel.\n\nMoving the dial into Sport modes changes a few settings throughout the car. Sport S mode remaps the transmission and throttle response, making for slightly more responsive acceleration. With Sport S+, the same things happen, plus the steering and suspension firm up — but only marginally so, perhaps most notably at highway speeds, as steering effort rises and the car feels more planted. But in twisty switchbacks, the firmer settings cannot mask the fact that there is a lot of mass being thrown around. The selector button doesn’t magically transform the smooth, sedate LS 460 into a snarling Porsche Panamera, not even in the most aggressive Sport S+ mode. Most drivers will find the differences to be minor, with the gauge cluster’s change from blue to red lighting the only real indication. The brakes are a strong point, however, with massive six-piston, black-painted brake calipers that provide excellent feel and bring the big LS to a stop with little drama and a lot of confidence.\n\nInterior\nWhile the F-Sport Package’s exterior changes are generally positive, the same cannot be said for the inside. The package replaces the real wood trim in the base and hybrid LS 600h with stamped metal trim, made from real aluminum and piano black lacquer, presumably made from real pianos. Black leather covers the seats and doors, with white piping and perforations on the seating surfaces.\n\nBut what comes across as modern and opulent in wood comes across as dark and dull in aluminum. Arguably the best interior color combination comes in the LS 600h L long-wheelbase hybrid, which can be had with a light bamboo wood trim that contrasts beautifully with the black upper instrument panel and available flaxen (tan) leather seats and doors. These colors emphasize the dramatic shapes and cut-lines of the interior panels, evoking a modern Danish furniture aesthetic that is truly attractive. Unfortunately, it does so in a $120,805 hybrid that gets 23 mpg on the highway — the same highway mileage as the all-wheel-drive LS 460 and 1 mpg worse than the rear-drive version.\n\nFeatures\nThe driver can control entertainment and other functions through a massive 12.3-inch display panel that is surprisingly not a touch-screen. It’s controlled by a joystick on the center console that requires the user to lay a hand on a handrest and move a cursor around the screen via a fingertip selector. Having to remotely move a cursor around on the screen adds an extra step to the process, which during a more complicated action — like hunting for a song or playlist on an iPod — becomes frustrating.\n\nThe benefits are a screen that never gets smudged by fingerprints (because you’re not touching it) that’s located high up in the dash to minimize the time your eyes are off the road. The on-screen graphics, however, are shockingly behind the times, featuring a clarity and sophistication that appears two generations behind the best systems on the market, and one generation behind graphics in mass-market brands like Ford and Buick. Controls for climate control and audio systems still have some dedicated buttons, however, meaning use of the electronic display screen can be minimized. Voice controls work well — and quickly, too — with flawless on-the-fly navigation operation in my first attempt, something other brands struggle to do.\n\nA 19-speaker premium Mark Levinson sound system can replace the standard 10-speaker system as a stand-alone option, but I found it to be oddly biased toward the center channel speakers in all modes. I was also surprised at how it struggled to hit high-end frequencies, particularly in vocal performances. In short, the electronic features offered in the top-of-the-line Lexus flagship struggle to outperform systems now common in mass-market compacts, which is either a testament to how much these systems have trickled down into lesser vehicles, or a statement on how much work Lexus has in front of it to remain a leader in the field.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, only a frontal crash test has been conducted on the 2013 LS, by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in which it received the top mark of Good. Additional tests by IIHS and the federal government will likely come later. Airbags abound in the LS 460, including front knee bags, side airbags and side curtain airbags. As is required in all new cars starting with the 2012 model year, the LS has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nLexus also has an available electronic precollision system with Collision Avoidance Assist. The system helps detect obstacles and can even brake the car to a full stop from 24 mph on its own.\n\nFor full specs and safety equipment listings, click here.\n\nIn the Market\nThe LS sedan range starts at $72,885 for a basic rear-wheel-drive model and stretches up to an eye-popping $120,805 for the long-wheelbase LS 600h hybrid (all prices include destination charges). Our all-wheel-drive model started at $75,830 but added blind spot monitoring, the Mark Levinson sound system, a cargo net and a trunk mat, along with the F-Sport Comfort Package, which includes heated and cooled front seats, a power rear sunshade, power-opening and closing trunk, and heated rear seats. The F-Sport Package itself included 19-inch, 10-spoke wheels, an adaptive air suspension, black leather interior, paddle shifters, and the interior and exterior styling changes mentioned earlier. All that brought the total for our tester to $88,029.\n\nUnlike earlier LS generations, which undercut the European flagships, this LS 460 is priced close to other luxury brands’ top offerings, including the BMW 7 Series, the Audi A8 and even the Jaguar XJ. All those are better-handling driver’s cars that offer considerably more choices in everything from powertrains to exterior colors. One hesitates to include the Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the competitor set, however, seeing how its base price is nearly $20,000 higher, at $93,255. Click here to compare the LS 460 with its competitors.\n\nOriginally meant to compete with these models head-to-head, the big Lexus simply hasn’t kept pace with the technology or exclusive feel of the German counterparts that it once upset. The same formula is applied today as it was nearly 25 years ago — a big, quiet, cushy, V-8-powered sedan that does things well and with minimal drama, but whose main goal is isolation and precision, not passion or ostentation. One buys the Lexus LS for the same reason one buys an Omega watch — it’s still a luxury item, just not the craziest, most expensive one of its kind. It’s highly competent, but not likely to get noticed — for better or for worse.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Lexus LS 460 falls short of the exceptional drivability we’ve come to expect from the car’s German rivals, but its value and craftsmanship are still impressive.\n\nThe years are piling up on Lexus’ LS flagship sedan, which hasn’t been fully redesigned since 2007. But the brand has maintained a steady trickle of updates and face-lifts, and the LS still costs thousands less than comparable rivals.\n\nLexus’ attention to detail leaves no stone unturned (or B-pillar uncovered), and the current generation is as reliable as high tide. It lacks the fierce acceleration and cloudlike ride that other flagships now bring to the table, but there’s still plenty to like.\n\nAn extended wheelbase turns the Lexus LS 460 into the LS 460 L. It adds roughly 5 inches to the car’s length and wheelbase, and it’s the only way you can get the pricier LS 600h L hybrid. For 2015, the LS gets some multimedia upgrades; click here to compare the 2015 and 2014 Lexus LS 460 engine and vehicle details. We cover the Lexus LS 600h L separately on Cars.com. Click here to see it.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHeavily updated three years ago with Lexus’ so-called spindle grille, the LS has stayed abreast of Lexus’ styling zeitgeist. F Sport versions swap the standard 18-inch alloy wheels for 19s; they also get a unique, darker grille, a lowered suspension and slightly more aggressive bumpers.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe LS’ defining attribute remains smoothness, but it misses the target (if barely) of absolute isolation from the road. Road and wind noise are near-silent, and ride quality with the car’s base coil suspension is composed over everything but the worst disruptions. Still, broken pavement and manhole covers reveal a degree of disturbance that the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series sedans we’ve driven filter out. We’ve also driven an LS with the optional air suspension, and that brings the Lexus closer to its German rivals in terms of outright comfort, but it’s still not quite there.\n\nCharacteristic of Lexus’ silky-smooth steering, the LS’ wheel spins as if the rack sat in a tub of butter, even in Lexus’ driver-selectable Sport mode. Work the sedan into a turn, and the nose points predictably, but slowly, into corners. The suspension limits body roll after a few degrees of initial wallow, but the movements all seem too gradual for much fun. That keeps with the LS’ character, though the F Sport might be more dynamic; RWD versions get a limited-slip differential.\n\nOur all-wheel drive (AWD) Lexus LS 460 had a 360-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission. In a class plagued by accelerator lag, I welcome the car’s predictable pedal response. The drivetrain upshifts seamlessly and provides quiet, steady power, but it shows moments of confusion as you catapult to highway speeds — upshifting too soon from one gear, holding the next too long. The rear-wheel (RWD) Lexus LS 460 gets another 26 hp and more torque to boot, but we’ve driven it, and it’s safe to say no LS can match the seat-pinning acceleration of the sport-tuned turbocharged V-8s in the S-Class, 7 Series and Audi A8.\n\nInterior\nMeticulous attention to detail is a hallmark of top-flight luxury sedans, and the LS doesn’t disappoint. Generous, stitched cushioning adorns touch-points like the upper doors and center console. Leather dashboards have many imposters these days, but the LS’ semi-aniline cowhide, which can optionally cover lower portions of the dash, looks and feels lush. Even the consistency of materials is impressive, with uniform, top-of-the-line graining and padding over virtually every inch of the cabin. BMW and Mercedes can’t claim that.\n\nBoth of those automakers can claim more features, however. The LS does have all manner of available extras, from massaging rear seats to quad-zone climate control, but many of the innovations elsewhere in this segment are unavailable. Massaging front seats, heated armrests, 360-degree cameras and panoramic moonroofs — all offered by one or more competitors — are not available in the Lexus.\n\nIn long-wheelbase models, the extra inches translate to just one more inch of backseat legroom, and shoulder room actually decreases half an inch. Fortunately, the regular-length LS is roomy enough, with legroom to spare for adult passengers.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUpgraded for 2015, Lexus’ standard Enform system includes app integration for a slew of apps, including Pandora, Slacker and iHeartRadio internet radio services, Bing search and Yelp reviews. Navigation, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, Siri Eyes Free integration, USB/iPod inputs and umpteen stereo speakers are also standard. The standard HD radio can pause, rewind and fast-forward up to 15 minutes; such DVR-like capabilities are spreading to a lot of vehicles.\n\nLexus’ standard Remote Touch Interface controls the action on a massive, 12.3-inch center screen. It lacks the laptop-style touchpad that Lexus has added to a few models (but now seems to be moving away from in future redesigned models). Some Cars.com editors have criticized the console-mounted mouse-like touchpad harshly.\n\nMark Levinson premium audio with a CD/DVD changer is optional. We’ve sampled the system in past Lexus LS 460 sedans, however, and it’s disappointing.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTypical of a luxury vehicle, cabin storage is marginal. Trunk room, though, is a generous 18 cubic feet. The optional power-adjustable rear seats diminish that space, but Lexus doesn’t have specific measurements for that configuration.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the LS earned top scores in moderate-overlap frontal and head-restraint tests. IIHS has not conducted side, roof-strength or small-overlap frontal crash tests.\n\nStandard features include adaptive headlights, a backup camera and eight airbags. Optional rear side-impact airbags and a knee airbag for the optional, passenger-side rear-seat ottoman bring the maximum total to 11. A blind spot monitor, full-speed adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with auto-braking are optional. Lexus’ Advanced Pre-Collision System adds a driver attention monitor and corrective steering movement to keep you in your lane.\n\nClick here to see the LS’ standard safety features and here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe LS steamrolls the competition in one area: reliability. The current generation, which dates back to the 2007 model year, has a squeaky-clean record for dependability. You might find that less important if you’re looking to lease the vehicle, but mishaps are still mishaps, and the LS will likely have fewer.\n\nThe RWD LS starts around $73,500, which ranges from a small discount to a huge savings versus German competitors. Standard features include self-closing doors, heated leather seats with umpteen power adjustments, a moonroof and the multimedia system detailed earlier. The F Sport runs about $8,000 more. Throw in AWD drive ($2,945 to $3,485), the extended wheelbase ($6,300 to $6,840, unavailable on the F Sport) and a bevy of four-figure option packages, and the LS can top out well into the $100,000 range.\n\nStill, the vehicle commands transaction prices well below many of its top rivals. The Lexus LS 460 is not the best sedan in its class, but it’s competitive in many areas, and the value equation should turn some shoppers in Lexus’ direction.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
