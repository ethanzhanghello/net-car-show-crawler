      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLexus’ popular ES, a premium sedan that plays up luxury over sportiness, received a range of updates at the 2015 Shanghai auto show. As we expected last week, the ES is an update of the current generation, not a full redesign. The car has additional structural reinforcements to improve body stiffness and handling, Lexus says, while more dashboard insulation aims to hush engine noise.\n\nExteriorThe ES wears an updated version of Lexus’ “spindle” grille, with more visual continuity between the upper and lower sections. New LED headlights separate L-shaped daytime running lights into offset sections. Vertical brightwork now frames the fog lights, which sit higher and closer to the car’s corners.\n\nThe taillights have a more-distinctive “L” shape within their frames, but apart from that, the sedan’s rear design mostly carries over. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard. The ES 350 has optional 20s; the outgoing car topped out at 18s.\n\nInteriorThe ES’ new steering wheel has a smaller hub, more-prominent spokes and more controls. The dashboard carries over last year’s layered approach, but areas around the center tunnel add some stitched trim, and the gated transmission shifter now has a leather boot, to, uh, boot.\n\nIt’s good to see the ES went the way of the redesigned RX, rejecting capacitive temperature controls (RC, IS) and the trackpad-style version of Lexus’ Remote Touch Interface (RC, NX) that’s irked some Cars.com editors. Instead, it has physical climate controls and the older — and more sensible — knob-style RTI, now with separate “enter” buttons along each side.\n\nLexus’ NuLuxe faux-leather upholstery is standard. Optional leather comes in regular or semi-aniline grades. Available trim includes piano black, wood or matte-finish bamboo.\n\nUnder the HoodWhile international versions of the ES have some powertrain changes (including the ES 200, pictured), engines in the U.S. carry over. The ES 350 gets a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, while the ES 300h hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors for 200 hp combined. The ES 350 has a six-speed automatic, while the ES 300h has a continuously variable transmission; both transmissions drive the front wheels.\n\nSafetyLexus’ new Lexus Safety System Plus combines adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic braking into a single option package.",

      "expert_review": "When Lexus launched in 1989, it only had two models in its lineup. One of them was the ES — so the sedan has a long history with the brand, and the newly redesigned-for-2019 ES is the seventh generation of the car. It’s been changed inside and out with a new platform, new powertrains and updated styling.\n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus ES 350 and ES 300h First Drive: So Close to Greatness\n\nThe ES shares the most in common with the Toyota Avalon, which was also redesigned for 2019 — and the two share more than just a passing resemblance. They have the same wheelbase, same overall length and mechanically identical powertrains, just with some slight tuning differences.\n\nFrom the side, the two models look fairly identical, but the ES has a few styling cues that let you know it’s a Lexus — starting with the grille. Most versions of the ES come with a spindle grille with vertically oriented slats; if you opt for an F-Sport model, you’ll get a more aggressive overall look, but also a 3-D sort of chainmail mesh grille that’s more in-your-face.\n\nThe ES will be offered in gas and hybrid versions. The ES 350 gas version of the car will get a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 302 horsepower. The ES 300h features Lexus’ fourth-generation hybrid system with a total output of 215 hp, and its estimated fuel economy matches the Avalon’s at 44 mpg combined.\n\nAcceleration from the gas engine is adequate — I wouldn’t say it’s mind-blowing, and that actually makes me prefer the hybrid version because you get that big advantage of fuel economy. Now, there is one catch going with the ES: It’s going to be front-wheel drive only. Pretty much all of its other competitors offer some sort of all-wheel drive, so it’s weird that Lexus wouldn’t choose to put some kind of AWD system in the ES — and that makes it stick out for the wrong reasons.\n\nFor more info, including full driving and interior impressions, watch the video below.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Lexus ES trades some substance for gimmicks with its all-new design, but it should draw interest for adventurous styling and a first-ever ES hybrid version.\n\nCharacterizing an ES has always been like trying to distinguish the flavors in oatmeal — a porcelain bowl of it from room service at the Hyatt, but oatmeal nonetheless. Lexus’ best-selling sedan boasts incremental handling improvements and refined ride quality in its sixth-generation redesign, but the interior is a mixed bag, and so is my verdict.\n\nAvailable as a V-6 ES 350 or first-ever hybrid ES 300h, the ES grew longer and taller for 2013. It now hails from the Toyota Avalon’s longer platform rather than the Camry, with which it traditionally shared underpinnings. At a media preview, I drove both ES drivetrains alongside the prior generation.\n\nThe Sharpest-Looking ES Yet\nThe front-wheel-drive ES adopts Lexus’ “spindle” grille — more of a fat hourglass — up front, drawing similarities to the recently reinvented rear-drive GS sedan. It’s actually a touch longer than that pricier sibling, and its creased lines stand out like no ES before. There is no ground-hugging F-Sport Package, as Lexus offers on a few other cars, but the ES needs none: It looks dynamic enough. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 18s optional on the ES 350.\n\nHow It Moves\nThe ES 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 moves out with a muscular exhaust note if standing on the gas. A Lexus spokesperson told me it’s a few ticks slower than the last ES — a tradeoff for better gas mileage — but crank the Lexus’ Drive Mode Select to Sport mode, as opposed to Eco or Normal, and sharper accelerator progression renders an even quicker climb. Alas, the six-speed automatic transmission still suffers befuddling inconsistencies: Sometimes it kicks down a gear or two for immediate passing power; other times it hunts aimlessly for the right gear.\n\nSport mode reduces power-steering assist for palpably better steering feedback. The prior ES had a tendency for the wheel to snap suddenly back to center. Its successor steers more naturally, with quicker reflexes. A redesigned suspension with uprated shocks and additional bracing also has been added, but does little to quell the car’s modest body roll.\n\nRide quality — a trademark of the previous car — remains sound. All ES models share the same suspension tuning. An adaptive suspension, which Lexus offered in two prior generations of the ES, is currently unavailable.\n\nThe ES remains front-wheel drive only with no all-wheel-drive option unlike competition from Acura, Infiniti, BMW, Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes. The Lexus GS does offer the option.\n\nThe hybrid ES 300h pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with two motor-generators and a continuously variable automatic transmission for 200 combined horsepower versus the ES 350’s 268 hp. At full bore, the car hustles well enough, but it lacks the passing confidence deserving of a luxury badge, and the droning, here-it-comes CVT sounds anything but refined.\n\nLike any full hybrid, the 300h can run on electric power at low speeds for short distances; an EV mode, activated via Drive Mode Select, raises the threshold where the car transitions to engine power. Drive Mode Select blocks EV mode if the car’s nickel-metal-hydride battery power is too low or if you press the gas for too much power. Stand on the pedal, even in EV mode, and the ES 300h springs to full power in moments.\n\nThanks to lower curb weight and better aerodynamics, EPA mileage in the ES 350 is up to 21/31 mpg city/highway, an overall improvement of about 2 mpg over the last ES. That’s near the head of the luxury competition, edging out the Acura TL, Audi A4 and Infiniti G37 by 1 mpg or more. The BMW 328i and four-cylinder Lincoln MKZ eke out another 1 to 2 mpg, however. One plus: The ES runs fine on regular gasoline; several competitors recommend or require premium.\n\nNo rating for the ES 300h has been given at this time, but Lexus says it expects the combined rating to be 39 mpg. That would make it the most efficient luxury sedan on the market, though the EPA has yet to give estimates for the redesigned Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.\n\nRoomy Cabin\nThe front seats have stiffer side bolsters, which became apparent alongside the prior ES. Where the prior car’s front seats allowed too much sliding, these hold you in — without constraining on long-haul drives. Although it moved to the larger Avalon’s platform, the ES’ cabin room falls closer to that of the redesigned Camry: Total volume is 100.1 cubic feet, up 5.2 cubic feet from the last ES, which falls in line with a moonroof-equipped Camry. The biggest change comes in the backseat, which gains 4.1 inches of legroom and 0.7-inch headroom. It’s roomy back there, with decent knee room and no center floor hump. Manual sunshades in the doors and a power rear shade are optional, but the rear shade requires hollering to the driver, as the deployment controls are up front only. Heated rear seats and a rear climate zone — both available in the Avalon — are unavailable.\n\nTrunk volume in the ES 350 is 15.2 cubic feet, up 0.5 cubic feet versus the last ES. That’s between the improved BMW 3 Series’ 17 cubic feet and the Acura TL’s surprisingly small 13.1 cubic feet. Typical of a hybrid, the ES 300h places its battery behind the rear seats, which lowers trunk volume to 12.1 cubic feet. Like the prior generation, the ES 350 gets a center pass-through but no folding backseat; the ES 300h has no opening at all. A power-closing trunk is optional.\n\nStop With the Gimmicks\nLuxury touches include piano-black or genuine wood trim, with real bamboo in the ES 300h, and optional ambient lighting below the door and dashboard inlays. Lexus’ NuLuxe faux-leather upholstery, offered in cars like the CT 200h, is standard. Last year’s ES had standard leather. The NuLuxe feels synthetic, but it’s softer than the often-stiff leatherette, aka vinyl, competitors serve up.\n\nHeated and ventilated seats are optional, but the ventilation borders on useless. That’s ironic since the Avalon has cooled seats that turned your chaps to ice. Similarly, the optional heated wood-and-leather steering wheel heats just the portions at 3 and 9 o’clock. Touch anywhere else and the wheel stays cold. I’m calling foul: If Chrysler can heat the wood portion of the 300’s wheel, Lexus should, too.\n\nThe gimmicks continue with an optional panoramic moonroof. It’s more like two small roofs separated by a massive divider, with clunky manual sunshades that short drivers won’t like yanking. Others — the Hyundai Azera and Cadillac CTS — have near-continuous panoramic panels that let more light, with power sunshades to boot.\n\nThe cabin trades last year’s chrome inlays for silver plastic, and the faux-leather dashboard trim is little more than a stitched veneer, which Lexus calls a stitched slush mold. Other entry-luxury cars, including Lexus’ own CT 200h, have more-convincing dashboard stitching, and Chrysler’s sedan can come wrapped in genuine leather. Similar stitching to the ES adds a classy vibe to the plebeian Camry, but in the pricier Lexus, it rings cheap.\n\nThe standard stereo includes USB/iPod compatibility, a six-CD changer — this is the brand that kept a tape deck long into the iTunes era — and Bluetooth phone operation. Options include a 7-inch display that works through a center-console knob or an 8-inch navigation system that works through Lexus’ second-generation Remote Touch Interface. Both systems add HD radio and Bluetooth audio streaming, which ought to be standard — and the six-CD changer dumped.\n\nRemote Touch plays out like a computer mouse, with haptic feedback to fast-track your pointer to the on-screen options, which include a suite of smartphone-tethered applications such as Yelp, Pandora and Facebook Places via Lexus’ Enform system. While the ES lacks the stunning expanse of the GS’ 12.3-inch system, it’s intuitive enough to work when the car is stopped. Still, I find well-sorted knob systems — like Mercedes’ Comand — easier to manage on the road. Mark Levinson audio is optional in navigation-equipped cars.\n\nSafety & Features\nThe ES has not been crash-tested, but Toyota engineers said they expect Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a harder-to-get five stars out of five overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Standard features include head-protecting side airbags and brake-pedal override, plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. New safety options include a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high-beam headlights. Lane departure warning — but not mitigation — is also optional. Per forthcoming federal requirements, the ES 300h has an audible warning to alert nearby pedestrians when the car is in EV mode below 12 mph.\n\nStandard features on the ES 350 include keyless access with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, power front seats, a USB/iPod-comparable CD stereo, Bluetooth phone operation and faux leather upholstery. Real leather, heated and ventilated seats, front and rear parking sensors, a navigation system and a panoramic moonroof are among the options.\n\nLexus ES in the Market\nAs of this writing, Toyota’s luxury division has yet to price the ES, which hits dealerships later this year. But the prior-generation sedan ranged from the mid-$30,000s to the mid-$40,000s as options ballooned. No competing luxury sedan has the ES beat across the board, but others chip away at its various weaknesses.\n\nThe ES is no tarted-up Toyota; the quality gains versus a loaded Camry are apparent, and its strengths are clear. This is the sharpest-looking ES in at least three generations, and the hybrid’s 39-mpg EPA combined rating should all but guarantee more interest. But too many surprise-and-delight features fall flat. Lexus needs to take a page from Audi: Ax the ventilated seats and faux-leather dashboards and invest in consistent quality instead.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Lexus ES 300h hybrid drives like a conventional car, but its overly firm ride is disappointing, its multimedia interface is distracting and its estimated gas mileage trails the competition.\n\nThe ES 300h was new for the 2013 model year, and the front-wheel-drive car uses the same hybrid system as the Toyota Camry Hybrid to get its EPA-estimated 40/39/40 mpg city/highway/combined. Changes for 2014 include newly available Siri Eyes Free Mode for compatible iPhones; to see how the 2013 and 2014 models compare, click here, or check out how the ES 300h stacks up against its main competitor, the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, here.\n\nThe ES 300h starts at $40,410 including a $910 destination charge. Features include aluminum wheels, push-button start, power front seats, a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, Bluetooth and a USB port. Optional features like heated and ventilated front seats, a navigation system with a backup camera, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and bamboo wood trim raised the price of our test car to $44,710.\n\nHow It Drives\nLexus has overcome the driving-experience quirks that have plagued many hybrids. Acceleration from a stop is smooth and predictable — even when the gas engine turns on for supplemental power. Its performance is similar to a strong, gas four-cylinder drivetrain, as opposed to a V-6 one, but the car is swift enough for city driving.\n\nOn the highway, though, there’s little reserve power; the ES 300h cruises easily at speed but makes more noise than acceleration when you press the gas pedal to the floor.\n\nApart from a slight shudder and the associated noise when the gas engine automatically turns on, the only thing that reminds you you’re in a hybrid is brake-pedal responsiveness. Hybrids have regenerative braking technology that uses the car’s kinetic energy to charge the hybrid battery pack. The ES 300h’s brake pedal feels linear, if a little soft, but what’s bound to catch drivers by surprise is the immediacy with which the brakes engage. The regenerative braking system starts slowing the car with just the slightest brake-pedal pressure. Unlike most conventional brake systems, there’s no initial dead space before the brakes engage.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of the ES 300h is how the car rides. Even small cracks and bumps in the road produce a hard, sharp response. It feels like a high-performance sports car, which is all the more tiresome because the ES 300h doesn’t handle like a performance car in the slightest. It’s not dynamic or engaging. Lexus seems to be on a mission to make all its cars sporty, but most ES 300h buyers are probably more interested in comfort, and it’s lacking here.\n\nThe hybrid system includes multiple driving modes: Eco, Normal, Sport and EV. The car starts in Normal when you turn it on, and I like the gas pedal’s responsiveness in this mode. Eco mode severely diminishes gas pedal response, and it wasn’t long before I got fed up with it and switched back to Normal. Sport mode switches the hybrid power meter in the instrument panel to a tachometer and makes the steering a little heftier. EV mode lets the car operate on electric power alone at slow speeds for short distances.\n\nThe ES 300h’s 40/39/40 mpg estimate trails the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid’s 45/45/45 mpg, and my observed gas mileage in the Lexus was about 25 percent lower than the EPA combined estimate of 40 mpg. According to the trip computer, I averaged 29.8 mpg during a 108-mile stretch, with an average speed of 19 mph.\n\nThat depressing average speed aside, it was very cold during most of my driving, with outside temperatures in the single digits and low teens. Cold temperatures tend to hurt gas mileage, particularly for hybrids, and the ES 300h was rarely operating on just electric power — even during slow-moving rush-hour traffic when you’d expect it to. My driving also included some stretches on fast-moving highways and suburban streets.\n\nThe extremely low temperatures also hurt the hybrid system’s seamlessness in heavy traffic. In stop-and-go driving the gas engine would abruptly start as you crept forward.\n\nInterior\nThe ES 300h’s cabin styling emphasizes the car’s width with its focus on horizontal lines. The optional Premium Package included light-colored bamboo wood trim that looked great and provided an eye-pleasing contrast to the rest of the cabin, which was finished mostly in black materials.\n\nOne aspect of the cabin that’s a little off-putting is the upper door trim. I sometimes like to rest my elbow there, and even though it’s technically a soft-touch surface because it has some give to it, it came across as being relatively hard. I expect softer trim in a luxury car.\n\nThe front bucket seats are wide and comfortable, and it was especially nice to have optional seat heaters during the chilly days I spent with the car. The seats warmed up quickly, but the center-console dial for setting the heat level was difficult to use when wearing gloves — even thinner fleece ones.\n\nBackseat comfort is very good for a midsize car; it’s nearly as comfortable as many full-size sedans. The outer rear seats have the same wide, comfortable feel as the front buckets, and legroom is good for taller passengers. The middle seat’s cushioning is harder and you sit a little higher, but the flat floor — there’s no center floor hump like many cars have — means more room for your feet.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nOur test car had Lexus’ Remote Touch interface, which is optional for the ES 300h. It consists of a mouse-like controller on the center console that moves a cursor on the dashboard screen. It works like a computer mouse.\n\nThe familiar interface should give Remote Touch a leg up on some of its competitors, like BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes’ Comand, but it doesn’t. It’s not a good interface for a moving vehicle. Even with the system’s haptic feedback that draws the cursor to on-screen menus, the cursor still jumps around too much. It’s distracting, and the result is that you end up paying extra attention to the system that would be better spent watching the road. This isn’t an issue with iDrive or Comand, both of which use knob-based controllers to jump from one on-screen menu to the next.\n\nBluetooth connectivity isn’t standard — surprising for a car that starts at more than $40,000 — but it’s included with the optional Display Audio and navigation systems. My iPhone connected easily using Bluetooth, and the multimedia system downloaded my address book quickly. The Bluetooth streaming audio function worked well, too.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe ES 300h’s trunk measures 12.1 cubic feet, which is about 3 cubic feet smaller than the cargo area of the ES 350, its gas-only sibling. The trunk opening is large and the cargo area has a nice shape, but unlike the ES 350, the ES 300h doesn’t have a pass-through for carrying long, skinny items inside the car.\n\nStorage areas include a small glove box (which is mostly occupied by the large stack of owner’s manuals), a decent-sized center console bin, average front door pockets and a small bin on the dashboard to the left of the steering wheel.\n\nSafety\nThe ES 300h received a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its crash-test performance.\n\nOptional safety features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, a backup camera and a Pre-Collision System that can warn you about oncoming obstacles as well as tighten the seat belts and autonomously brake the car.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nLexus has managed to get the difficult things right with the ES 300h, like relatively seamless hybrid system operation, but the car is lacking in areas you wouldn’t necessarily expect, like ride comfort and the standard features list (leather upholstery, Bluetooth and a backup camera are optional).\n\nWith hybrids, it’s always tempting to see how many years it’ll take to recoup the added expense of the technology (comparing base versions of the ES 300h and ES 350, the payback time is 3.4 years). Saving money isn’t the only motivating factor when it comes to buying a hybrid, however, especially when there’s a luxury badge on the grille.\n\nFuel efficiency for its own sake matters more for some, and the ES 300h’s 40 mpg combined rating lags behind mainstream models like the Honda Accord Hybrid (47 mpg) and Ford Fusion Hybrid (47 mpg) as well as luxury ones like the MKZ Hybrid (45 mpg). This is only the ES 300h’s second year on the market, but already Lexus has some catching up to do.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus ES sedan, along with the LS sedan, dates back as long as the Lexus brand itself, to 1989. Nearly three decades later, the ES is still kicking, but not well — the 2018 model proved the car was in dire need of an update. \n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus ES: More Sass, More Class\n\nI wrote last year that I preferred the new 2018 Toyota Camry to a 2018 ES 350 even though the Camry cost about 10 grand less as tested. Luckily, both gas (ES 350) and hybrid (ES 300h) versions of the ES get a full redesign for 2019. \n\nThe changes are familiar; many of them echo the updates to the 2019 Toyota Avalon I tested earlier this year that improved it vastly over its predecessor. Would the ES make the same leap? I headed to a national media introduction Nashville, Tenn., to find out (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events). \n\nHow It Drives\n\nGone is the sedate, calculated look of the old car. It’s replaced by a heavy dose of Lexus’ signature spindle grille and an elongated profile that gives it sleeker proportions. One could look at the aggressive new styling and think that it’s going to be sporty; this was part of Lexus’ effort to remake the car as more of a sports sedan. But I didn’t end up buying it — this car is still destined to be a cruiser, which it’s great at, but it’s no sport sedan. There isn’t quite enough power, and even the F Sport version (a first for the ES) suffers from the same problem as the Avalon Touring, which also has the adaptive suspension. Even with the car cranked all the way up to the Sport Plus mode (unique to the F Sport), there isn’t enough differentiation, and though the ride is firmer, it doesn’t seem to pay real dynamic dividends.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe ES’ powertrains are mechanically identical to those found in the 2019 Avalon and Avalon Hybrid, which also share the ES’ global GA-K platform. That means the ES 350 features a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 267 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic. The Lexus ES 300h combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a pair of electric motor/generators to produce 215 hp. A continuously variable automatic transmission is standard on the hybrid. \n\nThe updated ES rides more confidently and has significantly improved steering feel and feedback over the previous ES, a sloppy-driving car that drifted around on the highway and wallowed in corners. Despite a few unique suspension tricks and some tuning differences, the driving experience in both models of the ES is very similar to what you get in the Avalon, which is a good thing. \n\nIt’s not an identical experience, however. I noticed it the most under heavy braking when the ES remained firmly planted down to a stop, a circumstance under which the Avalon’s tail gets a little wiggly. Differences between the Toyota and Lexus may come from steps taken to increase the ES’ structural rigidity, including an added brace behind the backseats and additional structural adhesives and laser screw welds. For whatever good it might do, the added brace means the rear seats won’t fold down; all you get is a small center-seat pass-through that won’t accommodate an object as wide as a snowboard.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 300h | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nBoth models come with front-wheel drive only, though the ES’ luxury competitors offer all-wheel drive. When I asked Lexus about this, representatives said that the matter was “under study,” but it’s a big omission, especially for those living in the northern part of the U.S.\n\nIt’s worth calling out the fuel efficiency of the ES 300h, which doesn’t have official EPA figures yet but which Lexus estimates as 44/45/44 mpg city/highway/combined, a serious step up from the previous generation’s 40/39/40 mpg. Mileage remains substantially more efficient than the gas-only ES 350, which for 2019 Lexus estimates at 22/33/26 mpg, itself an increase over the 2018’s 21/30/24 mpg EPA rating. \n\nIn the Cabin\n\nInside, there are big improvements to both the styling and materials in both the front and rear. It’s now a thoroughly modern cabin, with an available 12.3-inch multimedia display and plenty of charging options (including a pair of USB ports and a 12-volt port behind the center storage bin). Buyers who opt for the F Sport version are treated to a pair of excellent front sport seats.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nAdditional sound deadening throughout keeps the ES’ cabin serene, in both gas and hybrid guise. Hybrid models get even more sound deadening, including extra three-layered padding at the firewall that’s designed to keep out high-pitched noises from the electric components. It is effective: I didn’t notice as much whine from the electric motor, but a lot of unpleasant four-cylinder noise still comes through. Even the V-6 in the ES 350 sounds tame, and though F Sport models supposedly pipe in engine sounds to the cabin artificially, it didn’t register with me (even with the radio off).\n\nSafety features have also gotten a bump. The ES comes with the Lexus Safety System Plus 2.0 which adds lane-tracing assist (an enhanced lane keep assist system that centers the car more accurately in its lane), low-light pedestrian detection, bicyclist detection and the ability to read road signs. \n\nMultimedia Struggles\n\nThe 2019 ES fixes many problems that plagued the previous versions of the car, but one big problem remains unanswered: the multimedia system.\n\nBesides the larger screen, the new system replaces Lexus’ mouselike controller with a touchpad. The touchpad isn’t an improvement; as in past Lexus vehicles, I just can’t use the system safely while driving. The menu structure is unintuitive, many common features are buried in submenus that require you to move the cursor long distances and the split-screen views often get jumbled up.\n\nLexus needs to take a cue from Apple CarPlay, which seems to work much better than the Lexus portion of the multimedia system. When activated, it uses the whole width of the screen and puts commonly used features as icons on the display. That makes it easier to get to the apps or functionality you’re looking for, which is a big part of making the whole kit and caboodle easier to use.\n\nApple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa Not Ready for Launch\n\nThere are caveats regarding both Apple CarPlay and the new Amazon Alexa connectivity when the ES launches. Lexus says that Apple CarPlay will be included initially on ES models equipped with optional navigation but not those without it until models built starting in October. With the car’s launch scheduled for September, that means there will be some models that come without it. A representative said the vast majority of cars will be equipped with navigation, and those without it will number in the single-digit percentages of the 50,000 or so ES sedans Lexus expects to sell in the first year (a little journalist math tells us that’s around 4,500 vehicles). Cars that come without Apple CarPlay cannot add it later. You’ll be stuck without it, so if you find yourself at a dealership and aren’t certain, test the system with your phone or look for the date of manufacture on a sticker on the driver’s doorjamb.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 300h | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe Amazon Alexa integration also has a catch. For those who want to get the full use of the integration through the Lexus + Alex app (which is required along with the Lexus Enform app), it will be available only on Android phones as of launch. Lexus said the iPhone app won’t appear in the App Store until late 2018. Once the app is released for iPhones, the system will also need to be updated to get the integration to work fully. Lexus is not yet sure if the update will be over the air or if it will require a stop at the dealership. And remember: If you want to take full advantage of the Alexa capability, you’ll need an Amazon account with other subscriptions, like Amazon unlimited music.\n\nLexus also didn’t offer a timeframe for potential Android Auto integration, which remains a bummer.\n\nVersus the Avalon and Luxury Competitors\n\nI deemed the 2019 Avalon a “road trip hero,” but that title may already be ceded to the 2019 Lexus ES. Its incrementally improved ride quality and composure plus better cabin materials and safety features give it some clear advantages over the Avalon, not to mention that fact that the ES looks better, too.\n\nThen again, the Avalon comes with Apple CarPlay standard, with no delay, and has a multimedia system that doesn’t make me want to punch a hole in the center console. And that’s enough to make me unsure of which I actually prefer out of the two.\n\nLooking at the price difference between the two further complicates things. Lexus would only say that the ES 350 will have a starting price of around $39,000, with ES 300h hybrid trim models commanding a $3,000 premium over the gas-only versions. (Avalon Hybrid models are only $1,000 more than their gasoline counterparts.) This puts the ES in fairly close competition to the Avalon, which starts at $36,420 and tops out at $43,120 for Touring models. That’s not much of a gap, so it might just come down to what you find most important. The multimedia edge goes to Avalon, the luxury edge to the ES.\n\nThe ES has more value when you start to compare it beyond the Avalon. Its price fits in between the compact and mid-size luxury classes while providing nearly full-size cabin space. More size for less dollars is not a bad proposition.\n\nThe ES’ multimedia drawbacks aren’t novel; I’ve encountered them in other Lexus vehicles. But it sticks out more in the ES because the rest of the car is so dramatically improved. The 2019 ES is this one change away from getting a full-throated recommendation from me — it would be a big change, admittedly, but something needs to be done. \n\nWe’ll have more details on the pricing and technology updates for the ES 350 and ES 300h as we get closer to the car’s on-sale date in September.\n\n2019 Lexus ES 350 F-SPORT | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chrysler 300, Genesis G80, Toyota Avalon\n\nLooks like: A dead ringer for … the 2020 ES\n\nPowertrain: Newly available 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and eight-speed automatic transmission (ES 250 AWD); 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic (ES 350); 215-system-hp, 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder and electric motor with continuously variable automatic (ES 300h)\n\nHits dealerships: Early fall\n\nLexus redesigned its ES sedan for the 2019 model year, giving it a more aggressive-looking design that uses the brand’s signature spindle grille. For 2020, Lexus added Android Auto smartphone connectivity as well as blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert as a stand-alone option. Now in this generation’s third model year, the 2021 ES gains a new ES 250 AWD powered by a four-cylinder engine and paired with all-wheel drive, as well as a new Black Line Special Edition.\n\nRelated: Volvo and Hyundai Are Tops, Tesla Not Too Shabby in J.D. Power Tech Survey\n\nExterior\n\nThe ES retains its same dimensions and basic styling regardless of model, including the signature spindle grille with trim-specific patterns — mesh made of interlocking L’s for F Sport models and vertical bars for non-F Sport versions.\n\nThe new Black Line Special Edition, based on the ES 350 F Sport, offers some cosmetic changes, including black side mirrors, “darkened” F Sport wheels and a black rear lip spoiler.\n\nInterior\n\nChanges are minimal inside, as well. Ultra Luxury models will get a new semi-aniline leather upholstery and wood trim combination of Rich Cream leather and Espresso wood. Base, Luxury and F Sport models use faux leather upholstery, and the Black Line model will feature an F Sport-specific two-tone white and black interior.\n\nEngine, Transmission and Fuel Economy\n\nMost significantly, the ES is now available in an all-wheel-drive variant, the ES 250, which can be had in all standard ES trims, including the F Sport. The ES 250 AWD is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The newly available smaller engine makes 203 hp and, even with the added weight of AWD, Lexus estimates the ES 250 AWD offers the best fuel economy of any gas-only ES at 28 mpg combined.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6-powered ES 350, meanwhile, offers 26-mpg ratings estimates to go with its 302 hp. It’s also paired to an eight-speed auto but only powers the front wheels. \n\nFor the more eco-minded buyer, there’s the hybrid ES 300h, pairing a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and battery pack for 215 total system hp. The ES 300h now uses a lithium-ion battery pack instead of a nickel-metal pack, and the battery has been relocated from the trunk to below the rear seat. Lexus says this benefits trunk space and the car’s weight distribution, improving handling.\n\nBoth the ES 250 AWD and ES 350 are available in F Sport trim, which adds an adaptive suspension and 19-inch wheels to both models.\n\nSafety\n\nThe previously available blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard on all ES models except the base, and the Lexus Safety System Plus 2.0 suite of advanced safety tech is standard on all models.\n\nLSS Plus 2.0 includes forward collision detection and automatic emergency braking, including daytime bicyclist detection and day- and nighttime pedestrian detection. It also adds other features including adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with lane keep assist and a lane trace assist feature that can work with the adaptive cruise control for a semi-autonomous driving experience.\n\nRelease Date\n\nThe 2021 Lexus ES should arrive at Lexus dealerships in early fall.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a five-seat mid-size luxury sedan that comes in gas (ES 350) and gas-electric hybrid (ES 300h) form. The ES 350 is powered by a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the ES 300h’s hybrid drivetrain features a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with total system output of 215 hp. Both models have front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Acura TLX and Lincoln MKZ.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nAndroid Auto smartphone connectivity joins Apple CarPlay, and most versions of the ES now have power-folding side mirrors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning with steering assist. Available features include heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES is a distinctively styled luxury sedan, and while the addition of Android Auto is welcome, the car’s Remote Touch multimedia system interface remains a frustration. The hybrid’s estimated gas mileage is underwhelming, too.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Acura TLX, Cadillac CT5, Infiniti Q50, Toyota Avalon\n\nLooks like: The 2021 ES with some very subtle updates\n\nPowertrains: 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with eight-speed automatic, all-wheel drive (ES 250); 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with eight-speed auto, front-wheel drive (ES 350); 215-system-hp, 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder and electric motor with continuously variable automatic transmission, FWD (ES 300h)\n\nHits dealerships: Late fall\n\nWe celebrated when Lexus added touchscreen displays to its popular RX line of SUVs, which eliminated the need to use a confusing and easily distracting touchpad controller to operate many of the car’s functions. The brand is continuing its touchscreen evolution by installing them in its updated 2022 ES sedans, while also giving the exterior a very mild touch-up and adding a new F Sport trim level to the ES 300h hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD Review: A Peculiar but Needed Lexus ES\n\nExterior\n\nWhen we say “very mild touch-up,” we mean it. The headlights are redesigned bi-LED units that are standard on all ES models, and every ES but the F Sport variants gets a new grille mesh pattern. The wheels, which range from standard 17-inchers to optional 18s or F Sport-exclusive 19s are redesigned, as well. Without a 2021 ES next to a 2022, though, it’ll be tough to tell them apart.\n\nInterior\n\nThe addition of a touchscreen is the big news inside the 2022 ES. An 8.0-inch unit will be standard and a 12.3-inch display optional. As in the RX, Lexus has also moved the display location forward — 4.3 inches in the ES — to make it easier to use as a touchscreen. The touchpad controller is still on the center console for those who want to control the screen functions in that manner or for those who can’t reach the touchscreen. Having been in the new RX with the touchscreen, however, I did my best to avoid the touchpad; it’s difficult to use and potentially distracting, and the touchscreen interface is a significant improvement over the touchpad. Lexus says it has also updated the instrument panel design for 2022.\n\n2022 Lexus ES 350 F Sport | Manufacturer image\nCarryover Power\n\nIn contrast to the interior, Lexus hasn’t announced any engine updates for the ES line. The all-wheel-drive ES 250 will use the same 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with eight-speed automatic transmission from 2021. The more powerful front-wheel-drive ES 350 has a 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 under the hood and also uses an eight-speed auto. Hybrid shoppers can choose the ES 300h and its 215 system hp from a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and electric motor; instead of an eight-speed, the ES 300h uses a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nNew for the more enthusiast-oriented hybrid shopper is the ES 300h F Sport that, according to Lexus, will be sold in “Western states” for the 2022 model year. On the ES 300h, however, the F Sport trim is mostly an appearance package: It gets darker, sportier exterior trim pieces and badging, a rear spoiler and black 19-inch wheels on the outside, and an F Sport-specific steering wheel, front seats, pedals, gear selector and gauges.\n\nA Dynamic Handling Package is available on the ES 350 F Sport, adding an adaptive suspension and additional Sport Plus and Custom drive modes; previously, the adaptive suspension with Sport Plus mode was a stand-alone option. The new package also adds Intuitive Parking Assist, which doesn’t seem all that related to sportier driving but is a nice-to-have feature.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2021 Lexus ES 250 a Good Car? 4 Things We Like and 3 We’re Not Crazy About\nHere Are 5 Great Affordable Luxury Cars You Can Buy Right Now\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2021?\n2021 Lexus RX 450h: 6 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2021?\nSafety\n\nThe 2022 ES comes standard with Lexus Safety Sense Plus 2.5. New in version 2.5 is Intersection Turning Assist, which can detect oncoming traffic when making a left turn or pedestrians during left and right turns and, if necessary, automatically activate the brakes to avoid or mitigate a collision. It also adds Emergency Steering Assist to enhance steering inputs during evasive maneuvers, and Lexus says the adaptive cruise control has improved behavior when passing a slower vehicle.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nLexus will announce pricing for the updated 2022 ES closer to its on-sale date, which will be sometime later in the fall.\n\nRelated Video: 2019 Lexus ES: First Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A 2022 update gave the Lexus ES a long-awaited touchscreen along with improved safety features. For 2023, the brand’s bestselling sedan returns with a new multimedia system, redesigned center console and updated F Sport models. These changes come with a larger price tag for each of the three powertrain variants: the six-cylinder 350, four-cylinder 250 and 300h four-cylinder hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus ES 350 Review: Now More Reasons to Buy\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 ES uses the latest version of the Lexus Interface multimedia system, featuring a higher resolution touchscreen and antiglare technology, as well as standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition to its welcomed touchscreen functionality, the system comes with an advanced voice assistant that makes voice controls more intuitive, says Lexus. Additionally, the ES is eligible for Lexus’ new 10-year trial period for the brand’s connected services plans.\n\nThe interior’s other updates include new trim options and a redesigned center console. Ash bamboo trim is added to previously available open-pore brown walnut and open-pore black options, and a new Macadamia interior color replaces Rich Cream. The center console also is updated with a new sunglass holder and cupholders, plus wireless charging.\n\nF Sport Selections\n\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nWhile the F Sport trim isn’t new to the ES, Lexus has expanded the options for 2023. Previously, all three powertrain variants offered an F Sport model with unique exterior and interior styling elements for a sportier look; however, only the 350 came with an available F Sport Dynamic Handling Package for performance-oriented distinctions. Now, Lexus has split up its F Sport offerings into two separate trims: F Sport Design and F Sport Handling.\n\nThe F Sport Design can be had with all powertrain options. Mainly an appearance package with some interior upgrades, the F Sport Design adds 19-inch gloss-black alloy wheels; a unique front bumper, grille surround and rear spoiler; and standard collision warning. Shoppers looking for sportier performance will find it in the F Sport Handling variant that replaces the Dynamic Handling Package. In addition to the visual elements of the F Sport Design, the F Sport Handling offers standard Sport Plus and Custom drive modes as well as an F Sport-tuned adaptive variable suspension. It can now be found on the 350 and 300h.\n\nIn addition to the exterior cues outlined above, F Sport models add interior upgrades like a premium Mark Levinson sound system, a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen, a head-up display, panoramic roof, and power open and close trunk with a kick sensor.\n\nPowertrain Trio\n\nThe three available powertrains for the ES carry over from 2022. The ES 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive; the ES 350 gets a 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic that only comes with front-wheel drive; and the ES 300h pairs a four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a continuously variable automatic for a combined 215 hp and FWD exclusively.\n\nTech and Safety\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new multimedia system in the ES is accessed through a standard 8-inch touchscreen or an available 12.3-inch display. The Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 suite is once again standard and includes advanced driver-assist features like blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. In the 2022 update, the system received camera and radar enhancements, new Intersection Turning Assist and Emergency Steering Assist features plus improved adaptive cruise control.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Lexus ES is on sale now.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a mid-size luxury sedan that coddles you with its quiet cabin and, when equipped with its available V-6, surprisingly quick acceleration. Motivating the base ES 250 is a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive. The optional 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the ES 350, however, is more in keeping with this sedan’s luxury image and overall refinement. Also available is an ES 300h hybrid variant that delivers 215 hp and an EPA-estimated 44 mpg in combined city-highway driving. ES competitors include the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES is essentially carried over for 2025. The only change of note is a new limited-edition Black Line Special Edition Package for the ES 350 F Sport Handling trim. The package adds black mirror housings, lip spoiler and sills, as well as F Sport puddle lamps, a head-up display, a 12.3-inch touchscreen and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nFaux leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nMoonroof\n10-speaker audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHead-up instrument display\nWireless device charging\n17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power trunk lid\nSurround-view parking camera\nAmbient lighting\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather upholstery\nInterior wood trim\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a smart choice for luxury sedan shoppers who prioritize comfort and quality. While the standard four-cylinder engine keeps the price low (and comes standard with AWD), the available V-6 is simply the better choice. It offers seamless acceleration and operates in near silence. Cabin quality is another aspect of the ES range that deserves high praise; there are soft-touch surfaces and nicely damped controls everywhere you look (and touch). The ES is not, however, a particularly sporty ride, even in its optional F Sport trim. But its overall refinement, ample feature content and strong safety scores make the ES worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a mid-size luxury sedan that coddles you with its quiet cabin and, when equipped with its available V-6, surprisingly quick acceleration. Motivating the base ES 250 is a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive; we think the optional 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the ES 350, however, is more in keeping with this sedan’s luxury image and overall refinement. Also offered is an ES 300h hybrid variant that delivers 215 hp and an EPA-estimated 44 mpg in combined city/highway driving. ES competitors include the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES gets available 18-inch wheels in a Vapor Chrome finish, along with a Technology Package that bundles previously available features.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nFaux leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nMoonroof\n10-speaker audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHead-up instrument display\nWireless device charging\n17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power trunk lid\nSurround-view parking camera\nAmbient lighting\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather upholstery\nInterior wood trim\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES family is a smart choice for luxury sedan shoppers who prioritize comfort and quality. While the standard four-cylinder engine keeps the price low (and comes standard with AWD), the available V-6 is simply the better choice. It offers seamless acceleration and operates in near silence. Cabin quality is another aspect of the ES range that deserves high praise; there are soft-touch surfaces and nicely damped controls everywhere you look (and touch). True, the ES is not a particularly sporty ride even in its optional F Sport trim, but its overall refinement, ample feature content and strong safety scores make the ES worth a test drive.",
