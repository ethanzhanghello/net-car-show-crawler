      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThis aggressively styled four-seat coupe debuted for 2015 as the RC 350 with a 306-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive as another step in Lexus’ ongoing effort to attract younger buyers. Rear-drive RC 350s use an eight-speed automatic transmission while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Cadillac ATS.\n\nThe RC 350 was later joined by the RC F, a rear-drive performance model with a V-8 engine. The RC F is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2016\nTwo new engines expand the RC lineup. The RC 200t is powered by a 241-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder while the RC 300 has a 255-hp version of the RC 350’s 3.5-liter V-6. The RC 200t comes with rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic, and the RC 300 comes with all-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic. The F Sport versions of the RC 200t and rear-drive RC 350 now offer optional orange brake calipers and a limited-slip differential.\n\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nLED headlights and running lights\nHeated side mirrors\nKeyless entry with push-button start\nAutomatic climate control\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\n60/40-split folding backseat\nBluetooth streaming audio\nCD stereo with 7-inch dashboard screen and USB/iPod connectivity\nBackup camera\nSafety Connect emergency communication system with one-year trial subscription\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n241-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (RC 200t)\n255-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (RC 300)\n306-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (RC 350)\nEight-speed automatic transmission (rear-wheel drive)\nSix-speed automatic transmission (all-wheel drive)\nNavigation system\nMark Levinson surround-sound audio system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBlind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert\nPrecollision system with adaptive cruise control\nMoonroof\nAdaptive suspension (F Sport)",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus RC lineup is receiving light updates for the 2023 model year, mostly regarding the cabin, in an attempt to help it stay competitive against rivals like the BMW 4 Series. The changes bump costs up $1,500 to start, and the luxury coupe now is priced from $45,470 (all pricing includes the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RC F Track Edition Quick Spin: Is the Ultimate RC Enough to Finally Find Love?\n\nThe interiors for the RC 300, RC 350 and line-topping RC F are largely carried over, but the infotainment system lineup has been shuffled around. All models get an 8-inch touchscreen standard, but an updated 10.3-inch touchscreen is also available. Trim on the glove box, instrument panel and side registers has also been revised, as well.\n\nThe RC’s exterior styling remains much the same, but for the RC 350, an available F Sport Special Appearance Package adds a two-tone exterior color combination, 19-inch Enkei dark-alloy wheels and a new paint color called Incognito. The RC F Track Edition will now also offer the Incognito color.\n\nPerformance hardware will once again include a trio of engine options. The base RC 300 comes with rear-wheel drive and is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while all-wheel-drive variants get a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. RC 350 models get a 311-hp version of the V-6, and RC F models retain the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 472 hp and comes with RWD only. RWD variants use an eight-speed automatic transmission; AWD models get a six-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Lexus RC and RC F are expected to arrive in dealerships early in 2023. Full pricing is below:\n\nRC 300: $45,470\nRC 300 AWD: $48,160\nRC 300 F Sport: $50,090\nRC 300 F Sport AWD: $52,380\nRC 350: $48,400\nRC 350 AWD: $50,565\nRC 350 F Sport: $53,020\nRC 350 F Sport AWD: $54,745\nRC F: $67,845\nRC F Track Edition: $100,720\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Lexus RC 300 F Sport Quick Spin: Less Than Meets the Eye\n2020 Lexus RC F and RC F Track Edition: Performance Pumped\nOur view: 2016 Lexus RC 350\nWhat’s the Best Lexus Performance Car?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four people and features four engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. RWD and AWD  versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The RWD RC uses an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus also sells the high-performance RWD RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. With the discontinuation of the Audi A5 coupe and convertible for 2025, the RC competes primarily with the BMW 4 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nThe bulk of the RC lineup sees no significant changes for 2025, the car’s swan-song year. The exception is the line-topping RC F, which now comes solely in a specially trimmed (and extra-pricey) Final Edition version with cosmetic upgrades that include BBS wheels and a carbon-fiber roof, plus luxury features such as heated and ventilated front seats and additional leather trim. The RC F Final Edition also gets a standard 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but — like a lot of coupes — its backseat is snug. And while the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sports coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. The RC’s core design is a decade old, and the market for two-door coupes of any stripe has waned considerably in recent years, making the RC’s discontinuation not too surprising. Even so, all versions of the RC have their charms; if you fancy this car’s blend of style, performance and luxury, you’ll want to act fast.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nThe 2020 Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Covered separately in the Cars.com Research section, the high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. \n\nRear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard convenience features include push-button start, dual-zone air conditioning, power-adjustable front seats and a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Options include a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, a power moonroof, navigation and a Mark Levinson premium stereo. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, the backseat is snug. We’re also not fans of Lexus’ touchpad-based multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four. There are three engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Rear-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series. \n\nLexus also sells the high-performance rear-wheel-drive RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard. A new Black Line Special Edition based on the F Sport trim features triple-beam LED headlights, 19-inch black-chrome wheels, darkened exhaust tips, a black interior with silver-colored stitching, ash wood trim and a two-piece Zero Halliburton luggage set. Just 350 will be produced. \n\nRarer still is the new RC F Fuji Speedway Edition that’s limited to 60 units. It features Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a titanium exhaust system, carbon fiber aerodynamic elements and red leather-trimmed seats with Alcantara simulated-suede trim. A limited-production MSTR watch with design cues inspired by the car is also included.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPush-button start\nDual-zone air conditioning\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof \nHeated steering wheel \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation \nMark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus RC?\n\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, the backseat is snug. We’re also not fans of Lexus’ touchpad-based multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nThe Lexus RC is a luxury sports coupe that seats four people, with four engine choices: The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. RWD and AWD  versions of the RC 350, meanwhile, get a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The RWD RC uses an eight-speed automatic transmission, while AWD models have a six-speed automatic.\n\nLexus also sells the high-performance RWD RC F, which is powered by a 472-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The RC competes with the Audi A5 and BMW 4 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nAside from a few new color options and available 19-inch Enkei wheels, the 2024 RC is unchanged from last model year’s car. It is, however, the last year Lexus will offer the RC F Track Edition, a pricey (six-figure) performance-oriented special edition that features a carbon-fiber hood, roof and rear wing, as well as Hitachi shock absorbers, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, and a unique black-and-blue synthetic suede interior.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus RC Are Most Important?\n\n Standard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\n60/40-split folding backseat\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport suspension\nLimited-slip differential\nRear-wheel steering\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation\n17-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus RC?\n\nGood visibility and a roomy front cabin are highlights of the RC, but like a lot of coupes, its backseat is snug. Competitors like the Audi A5 and S5 and the BMW 4 Series have fresher designs than the Lexus, and their more modern powertrains return better fuel economy. While the RC F’s V-8 is perhaps the best-sounding engine in the high-performance sport-coupe subcategory, the rest of the car feels outclassed by BMW’s M4. Also, the Lexus Track Edition’s nearly $33,000 upcharge over the base RC F feels awfully steep for some carbon-fiber body panels.",

      "expert_review": "I’ve always been a fan of the Lexus RC from a distance, for mostly shallow reasons. I think the way it looks inside and out is striking, with a slinkiness to the exterior and a snug interior that envelops the driver without feeling claustrophobic. It’s one of my favorite cars to look at and sit in, but when it came to driving, it left much to be desired.\n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus RC Coupe: 3 Updates to Look Forward to in Paris\n\nOnce behind the wheel, the adjectives I’d use to describe the RC flip from “slick” and “striking” to “lackadaisical” and “vague,” mostly due to a lack of immediacy from both drivetrain and the steering. However, for 2019, the RC is getting its first set of updates since its 2015 debut, and many of them are aimed directly at solving those problems.\n\nWhat’s New\n\nWe previously covered the changes for the 2019 RC, which made its debut at the 2018 Paris auto show. They include exterior and interior cosmetic updates, a technology update that adds Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa connectivity, and — most important — better handling, according to Lexus. The F Sport model, which I tested, also gets some added aggression to its styling with new 19-inch wheels and a striking front grille. (The car’s grille continues to be the make-or-break characteristic in the eyes of many shoppers.)\n\nTo be a relatively expensive coupe largely devoid of utility (it’s not what I would call a “usable” backseat), it must deliver when rampaging over pavement — otherwise, what’s the point? My test vehicle, a rear-wheel-drive 2019 RC 300 F Sport, ran $53,415 (including destination), and at that price, you can get some very good driver’s cars — our Best of 2019 winner, the Genesis G70, included.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nLexus says the updated RC carries with it grippier tires and stiffer suspension bushings, the goal of which is to make the car feel sharper and improve feedback. Those changes seem to work for the most part. Though the RC’s steering is still a touch dull for my tastes, the front end never feels lost, and if you give the wheel a quick tug, the nose dutifully rounds into place. I drove the RC on a pretty twisty road with plenty of elevation changes, and there were a couple of spots on tighter turns (especially pointed downhill) where the nose pushed slightly. But for the most part, the suspension and steering didn’t let me down, and the RC gets credit for these improvements.\n\nHowever, it’s what Lexus didn’t touch that puts a wet blanket on the experience: the powertrain. The RC 300 is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 258 pounds-feet of torque and comes mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. My car was RWD, but AWD versions of the RC 300 get a different engine entirely — a 3.5-liter V-6 and a six-speed automatic. I’m starting to think that maybe the AWD car might have been a better option.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Lexus RX and RXL Preview: Rejuvenating an Aging Icon\n2019 Lexus UX Scores Top Safety Pick Award\nResearch the 2019 Lexus RC 300\n2020 Toyota Supra: Everything You Need to Know\n\nThere are cars in which it feels like the transmission is letting the engine down, or vice versa. If one of those pieces falls out of sync, it can make the car feel lethargic or slow to react to inputs. In the case of the RC, it’s both; drive it even in its most aggressive setting, and the powertrain responds only after a few beats. Resort to the paddle shifters, and even if you keep the engine high in the rev range, it never feels crisp. Even shifts executed with the paddles feel slow — it’s like the entire powertrain is slogging through a swamp.\n\nContrast this with the latest turbocharged 2.0-liter powertrains from BMW or even the ones in the latest round of Hyundais (the Veloster, namely), and the experience is totally different. Even if those engines do feel a bit peaky at times, when you get them into the powerband, they rip. That experience is missing in the RC 300.\n\nWhat It Means\n\nThough the 2019 RC 300 is notably improved, especially for those with iPhones, its fundamental problems persist: There are too many good options in this price range that offer more utility and are more fun to drive. Beyond the G70 mentioned earlier, there’s also the Alfa Romeo Giulia, BMW 3 and 4 Series, Audi A5 and Jaguar XE that immediately come to mind. And if you take a look to parent company Toyota, it will sell you a Supra that starts at $50,920 — even lower than the RC I tested.\n\nI wanted to like the RC, and still enjoyed the way it felt with its great seats and that attractive Lexus circle tachometer in front of me. But cars are meant to move, not sit, and if you’re going to be an expensive 2+2 with scant cargo room and an unusable backseat, you’d better be competent on the road instead of just looking like it.\n\n2019 Lexus RC 300 F Sport Quick Spin | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
