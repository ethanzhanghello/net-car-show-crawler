      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe gold standard for unassuming luxury SUVs, the five-seat RX is a cornerstone of Lexus’ hybrid efforts and the brand’s runaway bestseller, accounting for more than a third of Lexus vehicles sold in the U.S.\n\nBuyers can choose from four powertrains in the RX. The base RX 350 uses a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 275 horsepower; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The RX 350h hybrid gets a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors for a total output of 246 hp; it has a continuously variable automatic transmission and standard AWD. The RX 450h+ plug-in hybrid pairs the 2.5-liter engine and CVT with two stronger motors for a total of 304 hp, and it can travel up to an EPA-rated 37 miles on electricity alone. (It exceeded that range estimate in our own test.) The most athletic RX is the RX 500h hybrid, which comes with a sport-tuned AWD system and six-speed automatic transmission. It combines the turbocharged 2.4-liter with a pair of motors to generate 366 hp. The RX’s rivals include the BMW X5, Cadillac XT5, Genesis GV80 and Lincoln Nautilus.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe RX was redesigned for the 2023 model year and gained its RX 450h+ trim for 2024. It sees minor changes for 2025, including a standard 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a limited-production Black Line Special Edition version of the RX 500h and an F Sport Design trim level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED exterior lighting\nKeyless entry and start\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen \nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport-tuned F Sport suspension\nMoonroof\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDriver’s seat memory settings\nPerforated leather upholstery\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\n21-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nWireless charging pad\nAutomated parking assist \nTraffic jam assist\nParking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe Lexus RX is a solid value, similar in size to vehicles like the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE, but priced against the smaller X3 and GLC. Lexus isn’t hitting that price by skimping on standard features, either, as the base RX comes well equipped. The RX is quiet and comfortable, and the hybrid 350h and PHEV 450h+ both deliver fuel economy in the mid-30-mpg range in combined city/highway driving. Shoppers interested in something fun to drive will want to look elsewhere, though; even the RX 500h isn’t particularly invigorating compared with similarly powerful class rivals.",

      "expert_review": "There’s a legitimate argument to be made that electric vehicles are not right for everyone. Maybe you have nowhere to charge at home, maybe you’ve heard horror stories about the state of public charging, with broken fast chargers and long lines, or maybe you take lots of long road trips and just don’t want the hassle of stopping to charge. But maybe you also like the idea of having an electric car — motoring without emissions and paying less for every commute. In that case, a plug-in hybrid might be exactly what you need.\n\nRelated: Is the Redesigned 2023 Lexus RX a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like, 5 Things We Don’t\n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThat’s what we have here. The latest and greatest mid-size luxury SUV from Lexus is the RX 450h+ plug-in hybrid — “h” for hybrid, “+” for plug-in (in Lexus speak). The 450h+ has a much bigger battery than the hybrid RX 350h and can drive for an extended range at higher speeds in all-electric mode, but it also has a gasoline engine so it can keep going when the battery is depleted. \n\nWe took a brief spin in the new ’24 RX 450h+ at an event in Austin, Texas, for the launch of the new 2024 Lexus TX SUV. We didn’t get much all-electric driving time, thanks to the battery already being depleted when we got into the SUV, but we were still able to get a good impression of what it’s like to drive.\n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nSpecial Equipment\n\nThe RX 450h+ uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that’s mated to Toyota’s proven continuously variable automatic transmission hybrid drivetrain. Instead of the nickel-metal-hydride battery that’s found in the non-plug-in RX hybrid, it uses a lithium-ion battery pack and is able to go up to 37 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates. \n\nThe gas engine alone puts out 180 horsepower and 168 pounds-feet of torque, but with one stab at the go-pedal in the RX 450h+ you’ll quickly realize that system torque is considerably more than that. Lexus hasn’t said what the system’s combined torque is, but total system output is 304 hp. Lexus says this SUV can jet from 0-60 mph in 6.2 seconds, so given it has a curb weight of 4,750 pounds, you know it has to be putting out a healthy amount of torque.\n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMy brief 30-minute stint in the RX 450h+ started off in gas-electric hybrid mode, not electric-only mode, because the battery had been drained by multiple test drives prior to my own. Although the battery is meant to be charged using a Level 2 charging system — and can do so in about 2.5 hours thanks to its onboard 6.6-kilowatt charger (DC fast charging is not available) — it also has a charge mode in which the engine will run both to provide propulsion and to charge the battery. I used this mode when I got in the RX, and after a 15-mile drive to a turnaround point, the gauge cluster meter told me I’d built up a couple of miles of electric range. I then switched it into EV Mode and drove back to the starting point.\n\nIn hybrid mode, the RX drives like most Toyota-based hybrids – smooth and quiet, with gasoline-to-electric transitions that are silky smooth and unobtrusive. Toyota and Lexus are the original masters of this kind of powertrain, and it shows in just how refined and lovely they are to drive today. And when you switch it into EV Mode, it only gets better. \n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nYou won’t find full-power acceleration in the RX 450h+’s EV Mode, but it’s still plenty quick for around-town driving and the twisty hills I negotiated in the hills west of Austin. EV Mode is a mostly normal driving experience, just without any powertrain noise — which to me only makes a luxury vehicle feel even more luxurious. This is the same powertrain you’ll find in the smaller Lexus NX 450h+ plug-in hybrid, but the RX has a bit more weight to cart around than that compact SUV. Accordingly, it’s a tick slower to 60 mph, according to Lexus, arriving in 6.2 seconds instead of the NX’s 6 seconds flat. \n\nThat said, acceleration numbers aren’t all that relevant here; nobody’s ripping off 0-60 sprints in the RX 450h+ – that’s not the purpose of the thing. It’s instead meant to be a comfortable, luxurious bridge between a normal hybrid vehicle that gets good fuel economy and a full electric vehicle, which doesn’t use gas at all. With 37 miles of driving range, the RX 450h+ provides something of the best of both worlds – enough electric range for many users’ daily commute, plus good fuel economy after the battery is depleted. (The RX 450h+ is rated 36/33/35 mpg city/highway/combined). If your commute is less than 37 miles round trip and you have somewhere to plug in at home, you could theoretically commute every day without gasoline but still have a gas engine right there for longer trips. No range or charging anxiety in sight.\n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nStandard RX\n\nThe rest of the RX 450h+ is pretty much your standard RX SUV, albeit at the top-level Luxury trim. Other RX trim levels include base, Premium, Premium+, and F Sport. This means that the interior features in the RX 450h+ are the nicest combinations of leather and wood you can get in an RX, and there are a ton of amenities — and the sticker price reflects that. The cheapest RX you can get is a base RX 350 with front-wheel drive, which starts at $49,950 (all prices include destination fee). The RX 450h+ Luxury AWD that I tested starts at $70,080, and the as-tested price was $75,330. That’s a lot for any mid-size luxury SUV, but it does represent the pinnacle of the RX’s offerings. \n\nThe RX is one of the best-selling mid-size luxury crossover SUVs on the market, and it’s often credited as the one that created the class. Lexus has kept it fresh, with new technology, a proliferation of powertrains that run from gas to hybrid to plug-in hybrid, and styling that’s in keeping with the brand’s motif without being too weird. The price of an RX 450h+ is steep, but for the right buyer it’s going to be the sweet spot between electric drive indulgence and RX familiarity. \n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Lexus RX 450h+: The RX Finally Plugs In \n2024 Lexus RX Plugs In, Base Pricing Starts at $49,950\n2023 Lexus RX Review: Still a Comfort Option?\n2023 Lexus RX 350 Vs. 2024 Mazda CX-90: Which SUV Has the Nicer Interior?\nAll-Electric 2023 Lexus RZ: Overachieving on Space, But Not Range\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
