      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with four engine options, including two hybrid models. The entry-level NX 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; all other NXs are AWD-only. The NX 350 gets a 275-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder that provides considerably stronger acceleration and passing power than the NX 250. The NX 350h hybrid has a four-cylinder that’s paired with two electric motors for a total output of 240 hp. The line-topping NX 450h+ has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that makes 302 hp and provides an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 37 miles. The NX’s competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Genesis GV70 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX was redesigned from the ground up for the 2022 model year and receives only minor trim changes and option updates for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\n10-speaker stereo\nVoice recognition\nDual-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nMark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic roof\nHead-up instrument display\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\n360-degree camera system\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAmbient interior lighting\nLeather upholstery\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a smooth operator among luxury compact SUVs, though it doesn’t drive quite as sporty as it looks — even in its available F Sport trim. The NX 450h+’s PHEV powertrain is a rare feature among premium compact SUVs, but it commands an eye-watering price premium over its stablemates. On the opposite end of the model line, we appreciate the NX 250’s relative affordability and nod to fuel economy, though its poky engine seems out of character for a premium vehicle. The NX’s cabin quality is excellent across the board, however, which is something we expect in a Lexus. Space in both the backseat and cargo area are OK, if not exemplary. All in all, the 2024 NX delivers what many car shoppers are looking for in a premium SUV even if it doesn’t stand out in any one way.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a compact five-seat luxury SUV with four engine options, including two hybrid variants. The entry-level NX 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic with front- or all-wheel drive; all other NXs are AWD-only. The NX 350 gets a 275-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder that provides considerably stronger acceleration and passing power than the NX 250. The NX 350h hybrid has a four-cylinder that’s paired with two electric motors for a total output of 240 hp. The line-topping NX 450h+ has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that makes 302 hp and provides an EPA-estimated electric driving range of 37 miles. The NX’s competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Genesis GV70 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX receives only minor updates for the 2025 model year, with two new USB-C ports in the center console, a wireless charger, a power liftgate, and front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking now standard across the line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\n10-speaker stereo\nVoice recognition\nDual-zone climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors with automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic roof\nHead-up instrument display\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\nSurround-view parking camera\nFront cross-traffic alert\nAmbient interior lighting\nLeather upholstery\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX is a smooth operator among compact luxury SUVs, though it doesn’t drive quite as sporty as it looks — even in its available F Sport trim. The NX 450h+’s plug-in hybrid powertrain is a rare feature among premium compact SUVs, but it commands an eye-watering price premium over its stablemates. On the opposite end of the model line, we appreciate the NX 250’s relative affordability and nod to fuel economy, though its poky engine seems out of character for a premium vehicle. The NX’s cabin quality is excellent across the board, however, which is something we expect in a Lexus. Space in both the backseat and cargo area are OK, if not exemplary. All in all, the NX delivers what many car shoppers are looking for in a premium SUV, even if it doesn’t stand out in any one way.",

      "expert_review": "Following an extensive redesign for 2022, Lexus has announced updated pricing for the 2023 NX compact SUV. Expected to go on sale in late October, it carries over a plethora of tech improvements and powertrain options — but with no changes other than a $255-$405 price bump for 2023 depending on the variant, shoppers can save by going with a 2022 model while it’s still available.\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus NX Review: A Day Late, Not as Short\n\nThe Powertrain Quadrant\n\nThe 2023 NX once again offers a pick of four engine options, with two gas-only models, a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. Gas-only variants are the base NX 250 (203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine) and NX 350 (275-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder). The hybrid NX 350h gets a combined 293-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with two electric-drive motor-generators, and the 450h Plus PHEV is powered by a 302-hp, 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder mated with a lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe NX 250 comes with front- or all-wheel drive; all other variants are AWD-only. The NX 250 is EPA-rated at 28 mpg combined for both FWD and AWD, while combined figures for the rest are 25 mpg for the NX 350, 39 mpg for the 350h and a rating of 84 mpg-e or 36 mpg as a hybrid for the 450h Plus.\n\nTech and Safety\n2022 Lexus NX 450h | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nNotable tech improvements came as part of the NX’s 2022 redesign, but there are no substantive changes for 2023. Gone is the prior generation’s frustrating remote touchpad, as the SUV now employs Lexus’ new multimedia system with voice recognition and a standard 9.8-inch touchscreen or optional 14-inch screen. Other key tech features include standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an optional 10-inch head-up display, available wireless charging, an optional digital rearview mirror and enhanced navigation.\n\nThe Lexus Safety System Plus 3.0 safety suite comes standard and adds advanced features like oncoming vehicle detection, enhanced road-sign assist and dynamic radar cruise control with curve speed management.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2022 Lexus NX 350 F Sport | Manufacturer image\n\nIn addition to the four powertrain variants, the 2023 NX comes in three trim levels: base, Premium and Luxury. The 350 and 450h Plus have an available F Sport Handling Package that adds performance enhancements like an active variable suspension and front and rear performance dampers with trim-specific visual elements. Inside, the F Sport Handling Package adds graphite aluminum details, a unique steering wheel, sport seats and black and red interior trim; the exterior gets a dedicated grille, black roof rails and 20-inch gloss-black wheels.\n\nStarting prices for the 2023 NX are listed below (includes $1,150 destination). The F Sport Handling Package adds $2,050 to the NX 350’s starting price and $1,250 to the 450h Plus’ cost of admission.\n\nNX 250: $39,755 (FWD); $41,355 (AWD)\nNX 350: $43,515\nNX 350 F Sport: $48,615\nNX 350h: $43,105\nNX 450h Plus: $57,705\nNX 450h Plus F Sport: $58,955\nVersus the Competition\n\nThe base NX’s sub-$40,000 starting price undercuts many of its luxury compact SUV rivals, including the 2022 Acura RDX (starting at $43,995), the 2023 Audi Q5 at $44,695 and the 2023 Volvo XC60 at $44,745.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Lexus NX Is Redesigned to Plug-In ‘N Play\n2022 Lexus NX Brings Smart Looks, Smart Tech\nRedesigned 2022 Lexus NX: 5 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\nResearch the Lexus NX\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

For the redesigned 2022 Lexus NX compact SUV, ”better” means smarter and more electrified. The NX arrives with a new multimedia system, more power for its gas model and a first-ever NX plug-in hybrid model. Here’s what to expect from the upcoming 2022 NX.  \n\nRelated: 2021 Lexus NX Sees Blind Spot, Rear Traffic Alerts Among Standard Adds\n\nThe Devil Is in the Exterior Details\n\nLexus didn’t take drastic measures with the exterior styling of the 2022 NX, instead choosing to focus on the significant updates in the cockpit and under the hood. To freshen up its compact SUV, the automaker took a chisel to the front and rear. A new spindle grille design is constructed from U-shaped blocks for a 3D appearance, while optional three-projector headlamps and L-shaped  daytime running lights create the updated lighting signature. \n\nThe rear of the NX trades the familiar L badge for a new Lexus logo that takes a prominent position on the liftgate. The rear lighting consists of a full-width blade lamp borrowed from the UX SUV and IS sedan along with a separated L-shaped lamp on the rear fender.\n\nA Tech-Packed Interior\n\nInside the cabin, the changes to the 2022 Lexus NX are focused on improving the vehicle’s digital experience. Driver information is now projected via two new features in the NX including a high-definition 7-inch multi-instrument display and an optional 10-inch head-up display. A standard 9.8-inch touchscreen can be supersized to an optional 14 inches, which is a first for the NX. Along with the technology upgrades, Lexus claims to have reduced noise in the NX’s cabin, redesigned the seats, and added headroom, legroom and additional storage space in the rear cargo area. The NX also gains an optional panoramic moonroof for 2022. \n\nNew Multimedia System\n\nThe new Lexus Interface multimedia system is smarter thanks to a new user interface and Virtual Assistant that uses voice recognition to access features like navigation, phone, climate control and other vehicle settings. Navigation is enhanced to become faster and more accurate with an offline mode that detects areas with poor connectivity and downloads maps preemptively. The 2022 Lexus NX comes standard with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity and available wireless charging. \n\nSafety Upgrades\n\nLexus updates the 2022 NX with its latest Lexus Safety System Plus 3.0, adding oncoming vehicle detection to the precollision system, enhanced road sign assist and dynamic radar cruise control that now features curve speed management. Another notable safety feature added to the NX is an optional digital rearview mirror. \n\nNX 350: Bigger Engine, More Power\n\nLexus offers two gas-powered NX models for 2022. In addition to the base NX 250, which comes with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and makes 203 horsepower, the NX 350 gets a more powerful turbocharged 2.4-liter engine. . Compared to the 2021 NX 300’s turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, the new engine boosts horsepower to 275 from 235, and torque to 317 pounds-feet, up from 258. Lexus says performance is improved thanks to a new eight-speed transmission, increased torsional rigidity and enhanced aerodynamics. \n\nChoose Your Poison (or Electrified NX) \n\nThe outgoing NX is offered in hybrid form with the 2021 NX 300h. The 2022 NX lineup will expand the model’s electrified options with a new NX 350h hybrid and a first-ever 450h Plus plug-in hybrid. \n\nNX 350h Hybrid\n\nThe 2022 NX 350h features Lexus’ Hybrid Drive system that marries a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric-drive motor-generators for increased power and better mpg over the 2021 NX 300h. The new 350h gets a combined 239 hp, which is 45 more horses than the 300h. The hybrid also gets an estimated 36 mpg combined, up from 31 mpg for the current model. The hybrid comes with standard all-wheel drive and gets a f0-60-mph time of 7.2 seconds.\n\nFirst-Ever NX 450h Plus Plug-In Hybrid\n\nFor the first time, the 2022 NX will be available as a plug-in hybrid model in addition to the gas and regular hybrid variants. The 2022 NX 450h Plus offers a Lexus-estimated 36-mile all-electric range thanks to a high-capacity lithium-ion battery. Using the maximum charging current of 240 volts, the NX plug-in hybrid can be fully charged in approximately two and a half hours with the optional 6.6-kilowatt onboard charger. Charge times climb to four and a half hours when the standard 3.3-kW onboard charger is used. \n\nThe vehicle’s electric output is combined with a 302-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and is expected to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.0 seconds. The plug-in hybrid comes with an electronically controlled, full-time AWD system and offers the benefit of Predictive Efficient Drive that learns the driver’s habits to optimize when the hybrid battery is engaged to improve fuel consumption. \n\nF Sport Returns \n\nThe gas and plug-in hybrid NX models can be enhanced with a handling and appearance upgrade in the form of the F Sport handling model. The NX F Sport’s sportier handling comes courtesy of an active variable suspension and front and rear performance dampers. \n\nThe F Sport gets exclusive styling inside the cabin with unique graphite aluminum details, new steering wheel, sport seats, and black and red interior trim. The exterior gets a dedicated grille, unique front and rear bumpers, black roof rails and 20-inch gloss black wheels with color-key overfenders.\n\nLexus says the 2022 NX will begin production in the third quarter of 2021; pricing will be revealed closer to the on-sale date. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHere’s Every Car That Earned an IIHS Top Safety Award for 2021\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2021?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Lexus NX 300h?\n2021 Lexus RX 450h Review: The Best RX?\n2021 Lexus RX 450h: 6 Things We Like and 2 Things We Don’t\n\nRelated Video: 2020 Lexus RX: Review\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
