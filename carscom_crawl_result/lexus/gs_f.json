      "expert_review": "Even though I prefer cheap eats, I see the value and appeal of fine dining — the kind that requires reservations, real shoes and maybe even utilizing the valet (which violates my free-parking ethos). But if I’m going to pony up for it, everything about the experience better match up to the price, from the service to the ambiance. And the food better be worth it, too, or I’m going to feel cheated and stop by the taco truck on the way home.\n\nThe 2017 Lexus GS F has a fine-dining price tag, and with that comes a lot of expectations, especially when it comes to performance — the main course of any high-performance sedan. Look around this price range and you’ll find formidable competitors: the Audi S6, the Mercedes-AMG E43 and the Cadillac CTS-V. Compare all four here.\n\nLexus has made a few key changes for 2017, the most important being the addition of an active suspension. Compare the new version to last year’s model here. Be aware that the GS F is a distinct model, not to be confused with a lesser GS 200t or a GS 350 equipped with the optional F Sport package, which adds modest performance and cosmetic upgrades.\n\nStyling\n\nThere are a few details that distinguish the GS F from regular GS models in addition to its distinctive V-8 exhaust note. Up front, the spindle grille gets the mesh treatment, and the front bumper has additional air inlets. The rear features a carbon-fiber-wrapped lip spoiler, a rear diffuser and quad exhaust pipes — a Lexus F Series signature. Inside are carbon-fiber trim pieces, seats adorned with the “F” logo and, in our test vehicle, a Circuit Red color scheme right from BMW’s styling playbook.\n\nOverall, the GS F looks close to regular GS models; it wears its high-performance credentials modestly until you get up close.\n\nHigh-Performance Parts\n\nForced-air induction has become the new normal for high-performance luxury cars, but Lexus has forgone turbocharging and stuck with large displacement. The GS F has the same 5.0-liter V-8 found in the RC F and the LC 500, which makes 467 horsepower and 389 pounds-feet of torque. The GS F comes only with rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Brembo brakes are also standard for added stopping power, with 14.9-inch slotted rotors up front and 13.5-inch slotted rotors in the rear.\n\nThe 2017 model year also brings suspension updates to the GS F. There’s now a linear adaptive variable suspension that can adjust shock absorber firmness to keep the car more balanced during cornering. There’s also a torque-vectoring differential that can shift power between the left and right drive wheels. The diff has selectable settings: Normal (for everyday use), Slalom (for an emphasis on steering response) and Track (high-speed handling and stability).\n\nFuel-economy figures are an EPA-estimated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gasoline.\n\nBut How Does It Drive?\n\nOn paper the GS F has impressive credentials: a claimed zero-to-60-mph time of 4.5 seconds, a new adaptive suspension and that trick rear differential. From behind the wheel, though, the experience is lacking for a few important reasons.\n\nFirst, Lexus just doesn’t do steering feel well. Although the wheel had decent heft to it, feedback was lacking and the nose felt a bit languid on turn-in. This isn’t helped by the fact that the GS F is not svelte; it’s 4,034 pounds, and the suspension struggles to handle that weight effectively. Dive into a corner and the heft pushes the GS F into understeer.\n\nAnother problem I had with the GS F was keeping the engine in the power band. Though the throttle proved to be responsive, maximum torque doesn’t come on until 4,800 rpm, which means you have to really lean into the engine to sling a GS F back up to speed.\n\nThe GS F’s transmission and engine work well together. I’ve had problems with Lexus’ eight-speed automatic hunting around a lot, but it was solid in this application. It seems like the additional power from the V-8 makes it easier for the transmission to pick a gear and stick with it. Grip from the standard Michelin Pilot Super Sport summer tires is plentiful, though the tires make a lot of noise when the car is pushed.\n\nComfortable Yet Frustrating Interior\n\nI’m a fan of the GS F’s cabin. It’s comfortable and has great materials. I was similarly enamored with the red upholstery in my test car, which played well against the white exterior and added necessary visual contrast. The front seats are extremely comfortable — bolstered without being too aggressive — and the standard heated and ventilated seats are tied to the climate control, so they can be instructed to turn on automatically to help regulate the temperature.\n\nAs much as I liked the rest of the interior, however, I disliked the multimedia system. This complaint is starting to get repetitive, but Lexus needs to do something about it (and fast) because the system is way too hard to control as it’s currently configured.\n\n$$IMAGE 28, 30, 20$$\n\nThe small joystick moves a mouselike cursor around the screen. It’s kind of cool at first: When you move from button to button, the joystick transmits a small tactile bump to let you know. But then you quickly realize that actually using the system is cumbersome and distracting; confirming that you’ve selected what you intended seems to require extra glances. I found it difficult to use the system and safely operate the vehicle at the same time.\n\nWhere’s the Value?\n\nThe GS F starts out expensive ($84,915 including destination charges) and just gets even more so. My test vehicle added a Mark Levinson premium sound system for $1,380, plus 19-inch, 10-spoke alloy wheels ($600), bringing the total cost to $86,895. That’s a lot of money whichever way you slice it, and the unfortunate truth is that the GS F doesn’t offer enough luxury or performance to justify its price tag, especially when like-priced competitors overwhelm it both on the spec sheet and on the road.\n\nCadillac says the CTS-V does the sprint from zero-to-60 in 3.7 seconds, and it’s capable of 200 mph. By Audi’s estimation, the S6 is only a touch faster to 60 mph than the GS F (4.4 seconds), but it also costs more than $13,000 less.\n\nFor the GS F to remain competitive with these vehicles in this price range, it needs more of everything: more power, a better suspension and, above all, better steering feel. Lexus has done promising work with its designs of late (the LC 500 being the prime example), but it’s time to put up on the performance front, as well.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nThe 2020 Lexus GS is a mid-size luxury sedan that seats five people. The GS 350 is powered by a 311-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission goes in rear-wheel-drive models while all-wheel-drive versions get a six-speed automatic. The sporty rear-wheel-drive GS F features a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Volvo S90 and Audi A6. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nA new Black Line Special Edition for F Sport versions of the GS 350 is available. Limited to 200 units, the cosmetic package includes gloss-black wheels, gloss-black grille inserts, black mirror caps and a black rear spoiler. Inside, the black leather interior is accented by red trim and carbon fiber. Meanwhile, the GS F adds standard matte-black 19-inch wheels and optional blue brake calipers.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus GS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include a 12.3-inch dashboard screen, navigation, a power-adjustable steering column and a moonroof. Standard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, automatic high-beam headlights, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist.\n\nOptions include a Mark Levinson premium stereo, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel and a power trunk lid. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS continues to offer plenty of refinement, not to mention real straight-line speed in GS F form. The GS 350’s available all-wheel drive is another bonus, especially for anyone cross-shopping this luxury sedan with a similarly posh SUV. It’s too bad the multimedia system interface is overly complicated.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe 2019 Lexus GS is a mid-size luxury sedan that seats up to five people. The GS 300 is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the GS 350 uses a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The GS 300 comes with rear-wheel drive; the GS 350 can have rear- or all-wheel drive. A high-performance rear-wheel-drive GS F features a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS 300 and GS 350 have no significant changes. The GS F, meanwhile, now offers a limited-edition 10th Anniversary Special Edition that features matte-gray paint, blue Brembo brake calipers, black 19-inch BBS wheels with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, and blue interior accents. Lexus will build only 100 for the U.S. market.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus GS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include LED headlights, heated side mirrors, a power moonroof, an 8-inch multimedia screen and a power-adjustable steering column. Standard active safety features include full-speed adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist.\n\nOptions include built-in navigation with a 12.3-inch screen, a Mark Levinson premium stereo, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, a powered trunk lid and a limited-slip differential.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS' interior quality and comfort impress, along with its ride and handling, but we're not fans of the Remote Touch multimedia interface, and the optional Mark Levinson stereo was disappointing.",
