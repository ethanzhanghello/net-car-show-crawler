      "expert_review": "To test the redesigned 2006 Lexus LX 470, we headed out to Los Angeles with another couple for a sightseeing vacation.\n\nWhat better way to put the Japanese luxury sport-utility vehicle — the expensive sibling of the Toyota Land Cruiser — through its paces than to load it up with four adults and a week’s worth of luggage?\n\nThe LX 470’s chronic weak point, an underpowered engine, has been addressed on the ’06 model. Its 4.7-liter V-8 engine now makes an extra 40 horsepower compared with last year. But despite the improvements, the Lexus still felt a bit old and due for a major overhaul.\n\nWe drove an amply equipped, eight-passenger LX 470, with five options. Bottom line: $73,108, including shipping.\n\nSHE: We spent a lot of time in L.A. hitting the tourist attractions. But the time we spent in the LX 470 was pretty entertaining, too. For 2006, Lexus has made the impressive 11-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio system standard on its flagship SUV. You can get a rear-seat video entertainment system for an additional $2,469 and even the optional night-view system triggered some oohs and ahhs as we navigated our way down dark Mulholland Drive one night. That system projects a picture that looks like a black-and-white TV screen onto the windshield just above the steering wheel. It’s designed to improve your nighttime vision.\n\nHE: In fact, it does just the opposite. I found the night-vision system distracting, especially when I was trying to negotiate some of those tight turns on Mulholland in a tall vehicle that weighs too much and has a steering system that feels disconnected from the road. I’d advise you to save your $2,200 — or spend it on some of the other amenities, like the video entertainment system.\n\nSHE: Big picture: The Lexus was a trusty road companion, providing lots of room for four adults and lots of luggage. We all were grateful for the standard navigation system, which helped us find landmarks. There was a bit of a learning curve figuring it out.\n\nHE: I don’t like to come back from vacation feeling crabby, but I had some gripes about the Lexus. No. 1, we got lousy gas mileage. According to the dashboard readout on our test vehicle, we averaged just over 11 mpg over three days. And gas was not cheap in California. Toyota may have tweaked the LX 470’s looks a tiny bit –redesigning the front grille, the taillights and the 18-inch alloy wheels — but the overall silhouette is still the same. By that I mean, boxy, traditional styling that no longer seems to merit a second look on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nSHE: The ride was occasionally bumpy, depending on where we had set the adaptive variable suspension, and our friends complained that the running boards on the LX 470 needed to be wider to help passengers hoist themselves up into this tall vehicle. Our friend Ken said the amenities back there weren’t very user-friendly, either. He griped that you have to twist your wrist to reach the rear-window switch and that the rear light needs a dimmer feature so a passenger can peruse a guidebook en route without blinding the driver. These may seem like small things, but the expectations are high when you are riding in a $70,000-plus vehicle.\n\nHE: I appreciated the additional boost in power, which was sorely needed. Toyota hiked the output from 235 to 275 horsepower, and nudged the torque from 320 to 332 pounds-feet. The extra horses are really noticeable when you’re zipping around the Hollywood Hills, although it probably matters less when you’re off camping in the deep woods or down at the beach.\n\nSHE: I imagine that few owners will go off-roading in the Lexus, which feels more country club than campsite, with its upscale wood and leather cabin. And you can’t argue about the safety features, either, which are plentiful and include standard side curtain air bags, antilock brakes, vehicle skid control and a sophisticated tire-pressure monitoring system. I’d say the LX 470 still possesses a certain amount of star quality in the SUV world.\n\nPaul and Anita Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an automotive information services company.\n\n– – –\n\n2006 Lexus LX 470\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, eight-passenger SUV.\n\nPrice: Base, $67,945 (inc. $650 destination charge); as tested, $73,108.\n\nEngine: 4.7-liter V-8; 275 hp; 332 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 13 mpg city/ 17 mpg highway.\n\nWhere built: Japan.\n\nEstimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan : $2,080.\n\n– – –\n\nAnita: 4 (out of 5)\n\nLikes: Accommodates four adults and lots of luggage with ease. Command seating gives you great view of the road. Conservative, yet pleasing cabin. Great safety features. Lexus Link communications system helps with emergency calls, directions. Lots of amenities, including standard navigation with rear back-up camera. Bright white gauges pop at night.\n\nDislikes: Ride can be bumpy, especially for rear-seat passengers. Navigation system not intuitive. Rear-seat amenities need a bit more work. Difficult to get in and out. Boxy, traditional styling needs an update.\n\nPaul: 3 (out of 5)\n\nLikes: Decent, but not stunning acceleration. Gorgeous light wood in the cabin. Comfortable front seats. Great audio system.\n\nDislikes: Too pricey. Dismal fuel economy. Steering felt disconnected from road. Night-vision system was more distracting than helpful. Bulky and difficult to park. Narrow running boards are dangerous when wet and slippery.",

      "expert_review": "What a difference a letter makes.\n\nLexus manufactures two sport-utility vehicles with very similar names — the GX 470 and the LX 470 — but considering that getting an “L” instead of a “G” costs nearly an extra $20,000, it’s a good idea to know exactly what you want before writing that check at the dealership.\n\nHaving tested both SUVs with full-time four-wheel drive, I can tell you that the mechanical differences between the two are not that great. Luxury-and amenities-wise, it’s another ballgame.\n\nTo put it in Monopoly board-game terms, the GX 470 is Pennsylvania Avenue, and the LX 470 is Boardwalk.\n\nFor those who have never played Monopoly, let’s take it a step at a time and start with the new-for-2003 GX 470. It’s a big step up from the entry-level Lexus SUV — the RX 300, soon to become the RX 330.\n\nSweetly styled with smooth lines, fender flares and swept-back, integrated headlamps, the GX 470 oozes Lexus-level class. The story was the same inside the tested model — leather to the max with a nice blend of maple wood trim all about, including the steering wheel.\n\nStandard seating in the GX 470 is five, but a third row can be added to accommodate three more passengers. Personally, if I had my eye on the vehicle, I’d stick with the five-seat arrangement and use the back for transporting cargo alone. I had the optional third-row seat — with a back-bench air conditioner also thrown in — and it would be a tight squeeze for three adults.\n\nRolling, the GX 470 was most impressive. The 4.7-liter V-8 with a robust 235 horsepower and an even more impressive maximum torque rating of a 320 foot-pounds dug in and effortlessly zipped the vehicle ahead of traffic accelerating from stoplights (80 percent of the torque kicks in at a mere 1,100 revolutions per minute). Merging onto local freeways was a breeze.\n\nEven when working hard, the GX 470 showed little strain. The SUV went about its work quietly, and a rock-solid suspension kept the ride smooth. Special features controlling ride height and the damping rate of shock absorbers undoubtedly contributed to the silky feel.\n\nThose cavalier enough to take a vehicle with a starting price of nearly $45,000 off-road will find that chore made easier with the GX 470’s “Downhill Assist Control,” which automatically holds the SUV to a low target speed during steep descents.\n\nA fuel-saver the GX 470 is not. The federal ratings are 15 miles per gallon in city driving and 18 mpg on the highway. My own monitoring came in about 1 mpg less on both counts.\n\nAll in all, however, the GX 470 is a formidable middle-range luxury offering, certainly a competitor against other SUVs in the $40,000-plus segment.\n\nNaturally, there are those who want more, and for them there is the LX 470. My tester started at $63,125 and had a bottom line of $66,703. For these prices, a vehicle should have a lot — and the LX 470 does.\n\nThe tested LX 470 came with the same engine and four-wheel-drive system as the GX 470, and many of the handling enhancements on the two vehicles were identical. The LX 470 is not even that much bigger than the GX 470 (although three people in the third-row seat have more room to spread out in the LX 470).\n\nBut the LX 470 justified its pricing with a host of comfort, convenience and luxury features befitting the top-of-the-line SUV in the Lexus fleet. The list of goodies included a standard DVD-based navigation system, power-folding exterior mirrors and dual-zone climate control with smog-sensing technology.\n\nThe tested LX 470 also came with a $2,200 option called the “Night View System,” the greatest night-driving feature since the invention of the headlight and the best two-grand-plus you can spend for a little safety and security. Yes, similar systems have been on the market — Cadillac has touted its worthy offering for years — but the new Lexus system is state of the art.\n\nThe system projects near-infrared beams from two lamps built into the front bumper. The light reflects back to what Lexus calls a “Charged Coupled Device camera” mounted inside the SUV, at the top of the windshield. There, a computer processes images that are then projected onto the lower section of the windshield, just under the driver’s normal field of vision.\n\nIn contrast to infrared systems that detect sources of heat but blur surrounding objects, the Lexus system projects basically a clear, black-and-white television picture of everything nearly 500 feet ahead of the vehicle — including trees, boulders and road edges. During a late-night run from Lake Tahoe to Sacramento on Highway 50, I was able to clearly see sharp curves and various woodland features way before my eyes could see them.\n\nSimply put, NVS is an enormous safety aid. It truly could be a lifesaver.\n\nGrumbles on the LX 470? Well, it pains to see fuel-economy ratings of 13 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on the highway. A typical driver is likely to pay more than $1,600 a year for gasoline; a busy traveler is going to spend enough in a year to buy that Night Vision System.\n\nThe LX 470 tips the scales at about 1,000 pounds more than the GX 470, which means that the 4.7-liter V-8 has to work much harder to move the former. From a standing start, the GX 470 is much more satisfying in the performance department.\n\nAll things considered, it boils down to choice. As for me, I’d probably take the GX 470 as a vehicle that gives me plenty of what I need on the roadways. My guess is that many dedicated SUV drivers looking to move up in class will feel the same way.\n\nIf you want the whole Lexus experience and are fortunate enough to have the financial juice to swing it, the LX 470 should absolutely please you.\n\nWhatever the choice, Lexus’ SUV lineup is now more loaded than ever.",

      "expert_review": "If consumers were willing to stand in line and beg salesmen to take the $25,000 out of their hands in exchange for a compact sport-utility vehicle, they probably would do somersaults as they waived $50,000 at those salesmen   to get an even bigger luxury sport-ute with a status nameplate.\n      So Lexus, Acura and Infiniti rushed to market with dolled-up machines coated in metallic paint and bathed in leather and wood grain interior trim.\n      But in the rush to take    advantage of consumer eagerness to part with cash for a loaded sport-ute, Lexus simply added leather and wood to the Toyota Land Cruiser and Infiniti the Nissan Pathfinder. Acura borrowed an Isuzu Trooper and called it the SLX.\n      So Lexus ended up  with an LX450 name plate on a spiffed-up Land Cruiser, as much as you can spiff up a vehicle with ride and handling characteristics like those vehicles with “Brinks” lettered on their door panels.\n      But the rush to market was successful, as many    people paid for a prestige nameplate. More important, none of the Big Three domestic automakers had a competitor.\n      For 1998, it’s time for Lexus to pause, take a breath and bring out a sport-ute in which the luxury is built in, not added on,       because, after all, even bucking broncos come with leather seats.\n      Enter the LX470–just what Lexus needed. Actually, it’s just what the Lexus LX450 needed. The LX450 has become the LX470, giving the luxury sport-utility vehicle a much-needed more powerful, yet far more quiet and civil engine. The 4.5-liter in-line six has been replaced by a 4.7-liter V-8, driving the name change.\n      The 4.7-liter, 230-horsepower, 32-valve V-8 is smooth and whisper-quiet. It is based on the 4-liter V-8 in the Lexus LS400 sedan.\n      The 4.5-liter 6 produced 212 h.p. and 235 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 r.p.m. The 4.7 develops 230 h.p. and 320 foot-pounds of torque at 3,400 r.p.m. In other words, when you tap the pedal, the 4.7 knows what to do and does   it without hesitation.\n      The price you pay for quick vehicle response to pedal input is watching the fuel gauge move whenever the LX470 does. The mileage rating is 13 miles per gallon city/16 highway. The tank holds 25 gallons, but not for long. A  larger tank would help extend travel range, though a larger tank would also add more weight for the 4.7 to pull and defeat the purpose. One solution would be to lighten the vehicle, but then you’d have a 4Runner and Toyota doesn’t carry the same status as Lexus does.\n      By the way, that same 4.7-liter V-8 will power the full-size Toyota pickup truck being built in Indiana and coming to market in about a year. It is Toyota’s first full-size rival to the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet C/K as well as its   first V-8 powered pickup.\n      Other than fuel economy, the LX470 has only a few problems, one of which only is a problem if                                                                                                                                you are shorter than 5 feet 10 inches. The LX470 stands tall and when someone says, “climb aboard” the word “climb” must be taken literally. The shorter the inseam, the tougher the climb.\n      Inside, there are a few annoyances, as annoying as an      interior can be that penetrates your senses with the smell of leather from soft, very supportive seats. You probably could nap in those seats if you didn’t have to stay on the lookout for fuel pumps, or, in Lake Forest,to try to spot your one and only     Mickey D’s, which there is called “Le Mick’s.”\n      Lexus’ big sport-utility is less of a brute for 1998. Front and rear tracking were widened to improve stability and cornering, but adaptive suspension similar to that of Cadillac is the main          contributor.\n      With this system, the shock settings automatically and continuously adjust to the road surface and driving habits when you accelerate, brake or take a corner or curve. The shocks provide optimum ride and handlin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and minimal shake, rattle, roll, sway, pitch or dive so you and your vehicle maintain equilibrium.\n      Ride and handling also benefit from the rack-and-pinion steering added for the first time for more precise reaction to wheel input.\n      The    LX470 employs full-time four-wheel-drive. A little transfer case lever is out of the way on the corner of the center console. You use that lever to get out of full-time 4WD high and into full-time 4WD low, but only if you intend to do some serious         off-roading or climb mountains or travel sandy sea shores or if “Le Mick’s” is up to its arches in snow and you just gotta have a Big Mac.\n      A very nice feature is the addition of a third seat in back. Up front there are two buckets and behind      those are two buckets and behind those is a little bench to hold two. In truth, with all those seats, most of which will never be used, it looks a bit congested inside, and when you peer back out the rear window, you get headrests blocking your            vision.\n      But that third bench is neat. It splits in half and each half folds up and against the sidewall. A plastic strap and clip attaches to a holder in the ceiling to keep those seats in place and open cargo capacity in the rear.\n      When  those seats are lifted and housed in the sidewall, you look down and see the exposed metal seat latches in the floor. Hmm. Metal latches can scrape cargo. Don’t want to do that. So you pop out the plastic covers on the bottoms of those seats in the        sidewall and they fit tightly in the metal holders in the floor over the latches so you won’t scrape anything. Very nice touch.\n      It’s also nice that the rear deck lid is a dual-mode unit. You can open just the glass window or the window and deck   lid as one unit. And the load height is low enough to present no problems getting your cargo on board.\n      The LX470 had one feature we would have liked to appreciate, and probably would have if we’d understood it better: The vehicle can go up or     down with a little prompting from a button in the console. Press the button and vehicle rides lower for on-road or higher for off-road clearance.\n      But to regulate the height, the vehicle must be in park and standing still except when in high and   not low and traveling at speeds ofmore than 31 m.p.h. and less than 12.5 m.p.h. and . . . have your salesman explain it to you.\n      All we know is it didn’t help get our short inseams in or out any easier.\n   We test drove a prototype and Lexus    says the production model will come with a running board. We hope.\n      Anyway, anyone who needs to raise vehicle height to take a $50,000 machine off-road through boulders, gravel and sport-ute-body-devouring trees, bushes and shrubs should have his  or her melon examined.\n      Along with the new engine, LX sheet metal gets a slight cosmetic makeover to make it look bigger and bolder. The split sliding rear quarter windo                                                                               ws have been replaced by a one piece glass for a cleaner, less cluttered look.\n      Overall exterior length grew 2.8 inches, interior cabin room 3.5inches, thanks to moving the windshield farther forward.\n      Standard features include all the     power goodies plus compact-disc changer, air conditioning, outside temperature gauge, electronic tilt and telescoping steering column, first-aid kit, tool kit, dust filter and nine cupholders.\n      New as standard for 1998 are individually reclining   second seats, heated front seats, power swing out rear quarter windows, one-touch open/close windows and moonroof, heated and retracting (to prevent carwash damage) outside mirrors, automatic on/off headlamps and a trio of auxiliary power plugs.\n       Safety features include dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, daytime running lamps and a jam prevention mechanism on each power window that stops the glass and lowers it seven inches if there is an obstruction.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Lexus LX470 and restyled ’98 Toyota Land Cruiser, share the 4.7-liter V-8 but to separate the two and give Lexus more luxury, the LX470 gets a few items that Land Cruiser doesn’t, such as automatic load-leveling suspension, active suspension, height   control, CD changer, rear-seat air conditioning, tilt and telescoping steering wheel, memory setting for driver seat/mirrors/steering column, programmable garage door opener, self-dimming mirrors and power folding mirrors that tilt down toward the curb    when you engage reverse.\n   >> 1998 Lexus LX470      Wheelbase: 112.2 inches    Length: 192.5 inches    Engine: 4.7-liter, 230-h.p.

      "expert_review": "When Toyota needed a sport-utility vehicle to supplement its line of Lexus luxury cars, it didn’t have to look further than its own Toyota Land Cruiser to come up with the full-size Lexus LX 450.\n There was some disappointment with the LX 450      among those shopping for a large limousine-like SUV, however. The first problem was the inline six-cylinder engine, which some shoppers found to be a bit anemic for a 2 1/2-ton truck.\n Other problems included the tight middle seat, which wasn’t as      comfortable as it should be in a vehicle that cost $50,000 and was meant to be a luxury eight-passenger people-mover; and the Land Cruiser/LX 450’s ride, which was a bit too harsh for a vehicle in this cushy-ride class.\n But all of those problems have  been addressed with the all new 1999 Lexus LX 470, which made its debut earlier this year alongside an all-new ’99 Toyota Land Cruiser. The only components carried over from the previous models are the four-speed automatic transmission and the two-speed   transmission transfer case for low-range off-roading.\n The new LX 470 and Land Cruiser now are powered by a 4.7-liter V-8 engine based on the 4.0-liter V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan. Horsepower has increased from 212 with the previous       six-cylinder to 230 with the V-8, but more importantly, torque has improved dramatically, from 275 foot-pounds with the six-cylinder to a whopping 320 foot-pounds with the V-8.\n Even more important is the fact that 80 percent of that torque is          available at engine speeds as low as 1,100 rpm, which is extremely important to get this heavy vehicle moving quickly off the line.\n As heavy as it is, the LX 470 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in just 10 seconds, which is unmatched in the          full-size SUV class. Neither of the LX 470’s two top rivals — the Lincoln Navigator and the Range Rover — are quite that quick.\n The LX 470 interior.\n The LX 470’s ride is much smoother and softer than before, and the vehicle doesn’t lean in tight turns as dramatically as the LX 450 does. That’s due in part to a new independent double-wishbone front suspension system that uses lower torsion bars rather than coil springs for better on-road performance, while allowing for exceptionally long travel to handle uneven off-road surfaces.\n Two high-tech additions also help give the LX 470 a limo-like ride:\n An adjustable height control that sets the body at one of three different levels from up high for the best off-road clearance to down low for the  best road-hugging performance. This doesn’t improve the ground clearance, it just raises or lowers the body on the frame. At the lowest point, which is the setting most people will use most of the time, the vehicle is low enough to the ground for easy     entry and exit. The highest level, for off-roading, works only below 18 mph; it automatically switches to a lower setting above that speed.\n Adaptive variable suspension, a fancy name for a computer-controlled variable shock ab                          sorber system. This system has driver-selectable ranges that control a computerized shock absorber setup that can choose from among 64 different settings, from extra cushy for bumpy roads to extra firm for interstate cruising. Although the driver can set  one of three ranges from soft to firm, the computer does the work automatically after that, detecting road surface and ride harshness and adjusting the shock absorber firmness accordingly (as quickly as 2.5 milliseconds).\n The third seat row, which was best left to the kids before, is even tighter now, thanks to extra room given to the middle seat. You won’t want to stick adults back there. In the new vehicle, the third seat is easier to fold down or remove than before, and many people will want to take it out for extra cargo space on trips if it isn’t needed for passengers.\n While most of the changes from the previous model have been good ones for a luxury on-road SUV, there have been some trade-offs that affect the LX 470’s of-r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      d performance.\n The Land Cruiser and LX 450 were arguably the best stock-equipped off-road vehicles on the market, primarily because of the suspension system that allowed for extra leaning (and therefore better agility over rocks and logs), and a       better four-wheel-drive system.\n The basic full-time four-wheel drive of the older models continues on the LX 470, minus two highly important features for serious off-roading: the previously available locking front and rear differentials. The LX 470    still has the locking center differential, which forces power to both front and rear when locked; but no locking front differential is offered and the locking rear differential is available only on the Land Cruiser version of this car.\n The LX 470 has  only a limited-slip rear differential, which isn’t as effective in sand and mud as a locking mechanism. The wheels, unfortunately, will slip when the going gets tough — something you never had to worry about with the former models.\n Now, even though   the LX 470 is still a capable off-road machine in most situations, it no longer is the champ in the toughest stuff; that crown goes to the Range Rover.\n But Lexus made these trade-offs knowing that most people won’t ever do any rough off-roading with   the LX 470; its use will be primarily as a luxury on-road, high-profile people mover, and in that regard, it has no equal.\n Among the luxury fittings, which are almost identical to what you get with the LS 400, are walnut interior trim, leather seats,  power-everything, heated outside mirrors (designed to dry up raindrops as well as melt ice), separate front and rear automatic climate control with smog sensor and air filter, premium 250-watt AM/FM/cassette stereo with seven speakers and a six-disc       in-dash compact-disc player, cruise control, remote entry, lots of cup holders, power tilt and telescopic steering column, and a programmable garage-door opener.\n Off-roaders or anyone trying to park this big truck in a tight space, like a parking      garage, will appreciate the electric fold-in exterior mirrors, controlled from a dashboard switch.\n Safety features include dual front air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes, which also work in low-range transmission mode. There is a computerized     control that decreases anti-lock braking effort at low off-road speeds for better driver control on steep slopes, however; this was almost a requirement to keep the LX 470 up to standards for off-roading.\n The base price of $54,950 (plus $495           transportation) brings almost everything as standard equipment. The only options on ours were a tilt-and-slide moon roof ($1,270), floor mats ($112), cargo mat ($65), towing-hitch receiver with wiring harness ($264), and roof luggage rack ($545).\n      Total price, including transportation, was $57,701, which put the LX 470 on par with the Range Rover 4.0 SE ($56,625), but well below the Range Rover 4.6 HSE ($64,125). The LX 470 still is way above the four-wheel-drive Lincoln Navigator’s                 $43,300, however.\n EPA fuel-economy estimates are 13 miles per gallon in the city and 16 mpg on the highway, which is slightly better than the 13/15 with the LX 450’s six-cylinder engine.\n The tank holds 25.4 gallons of gasoline; the vehicle can     operate on regular gas, but high-test is recommended.\n1999 LEXUS LX 470 SPORT-UTILITY WAGON\n The Package: Full-size, four-door, eight-passenger, V-8 powered, full-time four-wheel-drive, luxury sport-utility wagon, an all-new replacement for the LX   450.\n Highlights: Power has increased from the previous model, thanks to an upgrade from an inline six-cylinder to a high-torque V-8 engine; excellent ride and handling on and off the road; superb luxury in a massive people-mover.\n Negatives:        Off-road performance isn’t as good as with the LX 450; the front and rear locking differentials are no longer available; only a limited-slip rear differential is offered.\n Major competitors: Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator.\n EPA fuel conoy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            13 miles per gallon city, 16 highway.\n Base price: $54,950 plus $495 transportation.\n Price as tested: $57,701, including transportation.\n On The Road rating: A-plus.",
