      "expert_review": "During my test of the 2010 Lexus GX 460, I was routinely asked what I was driving. The only way I could get the questioners to grasp how the GX 460 stands out in Lexus’ lineup was to tell them it was the SUV that failed a Consumer Reports test of its stability control system. They instantly knew which SUV it was after that.\n\nQuickly, I reminded them that Lexus adjusted the system and that it is now presumably a “safe” SUV. But even so, during my time with the relatively short, narrow and very tall SUV, it exhibited body lean that was unsettling to me, despite my years of testing and owning large SUVs.\n\nIf the lone strike against the GX were its body lean, I’d still recommend it to shoppers in this segment, especially the many fans of its previous generation, the GX 470. Unfortunately, though, the strikes against the GX 460 just kept piling up during my test drive.\n\nNo $60,000 vehicle of any size or shape should be so flawed — especially when most models costing far less do far better in nearly every respect.\n\nExterior\nThe GX looks like a huge, lumbering SUV, but that’s mostly a misleading trick of the eye. The GX is actually shorter and narrower than competitors like the Acura MDX and Buick Enclave. It’s the SUV’s height that makes it seem bigger.\n\nAt 73.8 inches tall, it’s 5.6 inches taller than the MDX and 1.3 inches taller than the Enclave. It’s more than 4 inches narrower than both, as well. This added height and narrower stance — along with nearly 700 pounds more weight than the MDX — contribute to the body lean the GX exhibits.\n\nThe GX is handsome, with intricate headlights, a strong grille and lots of sharp angles befitting an SUV. It sure doesn’t try for a streamlined approach, as does its larger sibling, the LX 570.\n\nInterior\nThe level of luxury inside is pretty high. I found it to be nearly as rich as the larger, more expensive LX. Standout treatments included a leather-wrapped steering wheel and dash, with stitching befitting a Range Rover.\n\nI found the first- and second-row seats to be about average for the luxury class in terms of comfort, perhaps just a bit on the stiff side. The third-row seats now fold flat into the floor of the SUV; the previous setup featured two jump seats that folded to either side of the cargo area. It was this design that flagged the GX as one of the first luxury SUVs to offer a third row, and I think that’s why it became so beloved.\n\nAs it is, the new GX’s third row is nearly impossible to fit into as an adult, even after adjusting the second-row seats, which slide forward. My feet just had nowhere to go.\n\nPerformance\nEven if you like the looks inside and out — which many likely will — there is nothing endearing about the driving experience.\n\nFirst there’s the body-lean issue. When you take a highway off-ramp at speed — which the Consumer Reports’ test does — the GX leans at a significant angle. I don’t recall experiencing a lean so extreme since I’ve been testing cars professionally, which includes most of the past decade.\n\nIf you’re an attentive and safe driver, you should have no trouble navigating tight corners in the GX. But then you’re still left with an anemic 301-horsepower V-8 engine that’s saddled by all the weight mentioned above. Its power rating is nearly identical to the 300-hp V-6 MDX, but it’s less fuel-efficient. The GX is rated at 15/20 mpg city/highway, while the MDX gets 16/21 mpg.\n\nThe GX lumbers down the highway and barely musters a grunt when passing other cars. Brake feel is soft and somewhat mushy, an attribute shared by many Lexus and Toyota models. In a large SUV, though, it’s more unsettling.\n\nWhile the high ride reminds me of driving a truck, the GX rides better than your typical pickup. Because of extensive work to make the GX off-road capable, however, it doesn’t sail down the freeway like the larger LX, or like the MDX or Lincoln MKT. It’s noisier at highway speeds, too, and takes bumps at slow speeds with more body motion than you’d expect. Again, this is something at which the Lexus LX excels. \n\nTo recap, the GX neither rides, accelerates, turns nor brakes very well.\n\nCargo\nIf getting to your destination isn’t enjoyable, loading up the GX is even more exasperating. To get to the cargo area, you have to open a huge swing gate. While most SUVs have moved to a liftgate that rises upward, the GX sticks with the sideways move. That’s an issue both for parking and for petite users who may find its weight and size cumbersome.\n\nThen try lifting anything into the cargo area. It’s high — like, gut-high, which for me, at 5-foot-10, should be considered too high. Usually an SUV’s cargo area is thigh-high or, at worst, waist-high. But not the GX. It’s also not enormous. At 46.7 cubic feet with the third row folded, you can fit a fair amount of items from your local discount club in there, but not the largest of boxes or, say, an office chair. In terms of specs, it bests the MDX by a few cubic feet but falls far behind the Buick Enclave’s 67.5 cubic feet.\n\nIf the third row is raised, there’s just 11.6 cubic feet back there, according to Lexus, but I found it barely usable even for a few grocery bags. A child’s backpack might have trouble wedging in.\n\nSafety\nEven with the issues Consumer Reports raised and the sales halt that followed, the federal government has not yet crash-tested the GX. Nor has it issued a rollover rating. Most large SUVs, like the Ford Explorer, have a three-star rollover rating. Other luxury makes, like the MDX and Enclave, earn four-star rollover ratings.\n\nThe GX comes equipped with an above-average arsenal of airbags, including knee airbags for both the driver and front passenger. Seat-mounted side airbags are also standard for first- and second-row passengers, and there are curtain airbags for all three rows. There is also an optional collision-warning system.\n\nGX in the Market\nA decade ago, the GX was unique. Now every luxury brand has a three-row crossover. Most are excellent machines, and almost all can be had for prices similar to the GX. When you factor in all the GX’s negatives, buyers likely won’t even try to rationalize the cost.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Lexus GX 460 is a behemoth to drive, but the Premium trim I drove had a few redeeming qualities, specifically space and upscale extras including a heated steering wheel and power-folding third row.\n\nI recently embarked on a rare solo weekend outing featuring a quaint and quiet bistro lunch followed by an unhurried trip to the bookstore. I started out in the 2013 Lexus GX 460 hoping for some driving Zen — but bumbling through my neighborhood in this trucky SUV put a wrench in the qi of my alone time, so I turned around and ditched the Lexus for my own car.\n\nThe GX 460 hasn’t evolved much since the 2012 model year; see the two compared side-by-side here. If you’re in the market for a large luxury SUV, you may also want to look at the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Infiniti QX56. Compare all three here.\n\nThe 2013 GX 460 comes in two trims, Base and Premium. You can see their major differences here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe GX 460’s styling is pure Lexus. It’ll fool you a bit, coaxing you inside with its rich color palette, chrome trim accents, sporty rear spoiler, inviting running boards that help you step up into the SUV and an upscale Lexus grille. However, once you turn the key, start this puppy up and take her for a drive, your bubble might just burst.\n\nThe passenger doors were easy enough for my three daughters (ages 8, 10 and 12) to reach and open on their own; however, younger children will probably need assistance to reach the door pulls. My children could not, however, manage the weight of the extra-large, manually opening, mind-boggling, side-swinging cargo door on their own. Quite frankly, for $66K (as-tested) I’d expect a power-operated liftgate instead.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe GX 460’s interior is well-equipped for lugging the entire family around. We were able to fit our three kids plus an extra comfortably for a trip to the botanic gardens winter lights show. All three rows have air vents, which helped warm all the kids up in short order after our frigid walk. The second row also features heated seats in the outboard positions, which the non-booster-seat-using members of my brood jockeyed for.\n\nThe second row slides back and forth, creating more legroom in either the second or third row as you need it, and the third row stows away out of sight with a touch of a button. Accessing the enlarged cargo space, however, was an exercise in patience thanks to that door. Rather than lifting up, like most rear doors on SUVs do, the cargo door opens to the side like a giant, hinged refrigerator door. We were unable to use it inside our garage. The kids came around on the right side of the vehicle (based upon where I can park a car in our garage) with armfuls of backpacks, lunchboxes and display boards for their science fair. I attempted to swing open the cargo door with its hinge on the right side of the vehicle, and — bump — the door wouldn’t open completely without hitting the garage door, and in the process completely blocked the children from accessing the cargo area. I had to close the cargo door, have the kids squeeze past the dirty bumper to get to the left side of the car, then reopen the cargo door enough to jam their projects in. Opening the garage door first wasn’t an option, lest we risk ruining their project boards in a slushy downpour of snow.\n\nDespite the fact that the GX 460 has less cargo space than either the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class (93.8 cubic feet) or the Infiniti QX56 (95.1 cubic feet), the GX 460’s 91.9 cubic feet was enough for my family’s day-to-day needs.\n\nPassengers in the second row have access to storage pockets on the seatbacks in front of them, as well as in-door storage bins. Third-row passengers are practically out of luck when it comes to storage, with nothing more than a single cupholder for all their stuff.\n\nInside the GX 460, the trim design up front appears just as antiquated as the cargo door design. The square, angular design of the dash, while consistent with the angular look of the exterior, looks like a glorified old-school Toyota truck. Its square-jawed, masculine appeal doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo that women can vote and drive too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample-Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDespite its hefty 4.6-liter V-8 engine, the GX felt underpowered. My husband commented that it was tiresome to drive on the highway. Where many cars seem almost to propel themselves, with barely more than a thought from the driver, this one felt like it needed constant tending — like a fireplace — to keep its flames roaring and up to speed on the highway.\n\nI had a difficult time finding a comfortable ride in the GX 460. The Kinetic Dynamic Suspension system lets drivers choose between Comfort and Sport modes, and one didn’t feel any better than the other for my taste. The Sport mode was harsh and stiff, and the Comfort mode had me bumbling along, feeling like my kids must feel riding atop their inflatable Bubble Bum booster seats. Every bump in the road felt exaggerated.\n\nThe engine is very loud at startup and continues to be loud while trying to coax the car up to speed, then settles down a bit at higher speeds.\n\nThe GX 460’s full-time four-wheel drive and ability to tow up to 6,500 pounds (when properly equipped) makes me think this SUV is better suited for the adventurous, off-road, camping family than the one that uses it as a daily urban or suburban crawler. It has EPA-estimated mileage of 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined and requires premium fuel, which may not appeal to families who need an SUV to carry them through the daily grind.\n\nSAFETY\nCrash-test results on the 2013 Lexus GX 460 are not available. As has been required since the 2012 model year, the Lexus GX 460 has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. Dual-stage front airbags, front-seat-mounted side airbags, front knee airbags and side curtain airbags that extend to protect all three rows are standard.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in all three rows are on stable bases and easy for young children in booster seats with limited dexterity to buckle on their own. There are two sets of Latch connectors (in the two outboard seating positions of the second row). The lower anchors are concealed within a slit in the seat bight. For a complete Car Seat Check of the Lexus GX 460, click here.\n\nThe GX 460 comes equipped with a one-year free trial of Lexus’ Safety Connect system, which offers automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle location, enhanced roadside assistance and an emergency assist button.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus GX 460 gets modern front-end styling for the 2014 model year, but this luxury SUV still has a throwback feel in the way it drives and accommodates passengers.\n\nThe GX holds up to seven in three rows of seats and comes standard with a Low-range four-wheel-drive system for off-road (or simply difficult) driving conditions. With its body-on-frame construction, the GX is one of two traditional SUVs in Lexus’ lineup, the other being the flagship LX 570.\n\nBesides its all-new front-end look, there are new clear-lens taillights for 2014. The 2014 GX also offers a revised multimedia system and newly available safety features, like a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert. To see how the 2014 GX compares with the 2013 model, click here, or see how the GX’s specs compare to the Land Rover LR4, Mercedes-Benz M-Class and Audi Q7 here.\n\nThe GX starts at $49,995 (all prices include a $910 destination charge). Our test car was an uplevel Luxury trim, which starts at $61,625. The significantly higher price tag includes features like an adaptive suspension with rear auto-leveling, mahogany wood trim in the cabin, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, a power-folding third row, semi-aniline leather upholstery and three-zone automatic climate control. Our GX also had a $1,145 Mark Levinson surround-sound system, which brought the as-tested price to $62,770.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIt’s hard to miss the new GX — whether you’re standing right next to it or across a parking lot. The defining feature is Lexus’ hourglass-style grille, which has been incorporated across the brand’s lineup of cars and SUVs.\n\nIn typical luxury-SUV tradition, the grille is gigantic; it stretches from the hood all the way to the bottom of the front bumper. It’s a daring design — some might say gaudy — and it commands your attention in a way few SUVs do. The grille’s aggressive shape is quite a contrast from the rest of the SUV, which has relatively reserved looks.\n\nHow It Drives\nYou’re reminded of the GX’s traditional SUV construction the moment you start driving. It’s not hard to get accustomed to the SUV’s size, but the amount of brake dive and low-speed body roll are a blast from the era of SUVs past. You just don’t encounter it that often anymore, especially in the luxury segment.\n\nOnce you get up to midrange and highway speeds, however, the driving experience evolves into something more contemporary. The ride is comfortable, if a little firm, and the GX tracks with a secure feel whether the roads are clear or snow-covered. There’s a switch on the center console for the adaptive suspension with Normal, Sport and Comfort settings, but ride-quality differences are slight; Sport tightens up the suspension a little and provides more road feel, while Comfort softens the ride some.\n\nThe GX’s sole engine is a 301-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 that works with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the engine is tasked with moving about 5,200 pounds of SUV. The GX doesn’t feel underpowered, but it’s wise to plan your high-speed passes so you have plenty of space to make them. On the highway, the GX cruises easily at 70 mph and the cabin is relatively quiet.\n\nThe GX gets an EPA-estimated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined. The LR4, which has a new supercharged V-6 for 2014, is rated 14/19/16 mpg, while the twin-turbo V-8 ML550 also gets an estimated 14/19/16 mpg. The Q7 offers a supercharged gas V-6, and its estimated gas mileage is 16/22/18 mpg. According to the trip computer in the GX, I got 18.8 mpg during a 158-mile trip that included a lot of highway driving. It was quite cold when I tested the SUV, though, and that may have adversely affected gas mileage. Premium gas is required.\n\nIf you drive anywhere remotely civilized, the GX’s true capabilities will go unused most of the time, but certain situations make you appreciate what this SUV can do. The Chicago region was digging out from more than a foot of snow when I tested the GX, but with 8.1 inches of ground clearance and standard full-time four-wheel drive, driving around on unplowed side streets and alleys was a non-issue. The GX just plowed ahead and made its own path.\n\nInterior\nIt’s a bit of a climb into the driver’s seat, but standard running boards make things easier. Large windows enhance visibility, especially when checking your blind spots.\n\nThe GX’s mostly upscale materials include available mahogany wood trim and premium leather upholstery, but vast amounts of silver-colored trim put a damper on the cabin’s luxury vibe. It covers the middle of the dashboard and center console and is glaringly out of place in a $60,000-plus SUV.\n\nThe front seats offer a large-leather-recliner kind of comfort, but the second row isn’t ideal for adults. The seat slides forward and backward and also reclines, but the bottom cushions are close to the floor, so you sit with your knees angled up and don’t have a lot of thigh support. It’s another reminder of the GX’s body-on-frame platform, a design that’s not typically as space-efficient as the unibody construction used in crossovers.\n\nThe second row has a passenger-side walk-in feature to make third-row access easier, but the third row is small and really fit only for children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMany Lexus models have adopted the automaker’s Remote Touch interface, which features a mouse-like controller that operates a cursor on a dashboard screen, but the GX still uses a touch-screen setup. It might not be as high-tech as Remote Touch, but it’s easier to operate while driving. The touch-screen’s home screen is now configurable and can show up to three different system features, but I would like to see physical fan-speed buttons added to the center control panel so you don’t have to use the touch-screen to make adjustments.\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard, and it was easy to pair my iPhone with the multimedia system. Music quality over Bluetooth is good. However, another editor who tried playing music from his iPhone through a USB port had trouble getting the connection to work.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith all three rows of seats in place there’s only 11.6 cubic feet of cargo room, but that’s still more than the LR4 (9.9) and Q7 (10.9) offer. The GX’s third row nearly touches the rear window, leaving a shallow space for luggage that’s not very usable. Folding the third row increases cargo space to 46.7 cubic feet, and with the second row also folded there’s 64.7 cubic feet. The LR4 (90.3) and Q7 (72.5) both offer more maximum cargo room. The 60/40-split second-row backrest is spring-loaded, which makes it easy to fold but hard to raise — particularly the larger section.\n\nThe GX is one of the few SUVs that still has a swing gate instead of a liftgate. Since it doesn’t go up in the air, shorter people might find a swing gate easier to close, but this design makes it harder to load cargo when parked on a street. Hinged on the passenger side, the wide door opens to the curb and forces you to walk around it to get to the cargo area, which could be a problem if there’s a car immediately behind you. The GX’s considerable ground clearance and body-on-frame construction mean you have to clear a high cargo floor when loading luggage, too.\n\nStorage amenities include a deep center console bin and large cupholders. A large owner’s manual takes up most of the glove box, however.\n\nSafety\nThe GX hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of this writing.\n\nOptional safety features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, a wide-view camera system designed to help you see around blind corners, and a forward-collision warning system that monitors the driver’s focus and includes mild autonomous braking and automatic front-seat seat-belt cinching.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOnce commonplace, true luxury SUVs are a dwindling breed as automakers turn to luxury crossovers to give shoppers better on-road driving dynamics and gas mileage.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2014 about the 2014 Lexus GX 460. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Lexus GX 460 gets modern front-end styling for the 2014 model year, but this luxury SUV still has a throwback feel in the way it drives and accommodates passengers.\n\nThe GX holds up to seven in three rows of seats and comes standard with a Low-range four-wheel-drive system for off-road (or simply difficult) driving conditions. With its body-on-frame construction, the GX is one of two traditional SUVs in Lexus’ lineup, the other being the flagship LX 570.\n\nBesides its all-new front-end look, there are new clear-lens taillights for 2014. The 2014 GX also offers a revised multimedia system and newly available safety features, like a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert. To see how the 2014 GX compares with the 2013 model, click here, or see how the GX’s specs compare to the Land Rover LR4, Mercedes-Benz M-Class and Audi Q7 here.\n\nThe GX starts at $49,995 (all prices include a $910 destination charge). Our test car was an uplevel Luxury trim, which starts at $61,625. The significantly higher price tag includes features like an adaptive suspension with rear auto-leveling, mahogany wood trim in the cabin, a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, a power-folding third row, semi-aniline leather upholstery and three-zone automatic climate control. Our GX also had a $1,145 Mark Levinson surround-sound system, which brought the as-tested price to $62,770.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIt’s hard to miss the new GX — whether you’re standing right next to it or across a parking lot. The defining feature is Lexus’ hourglass-style grille, which has been incorporated across the brand’s lineup of cars and SUVs.\n\nIn typical luxury-SUV tradition, the grille is gigantic; it stretches from the hood all the way to the bottom of the front bumper. It’s a daring design — some might say gaudy — and it commands your attention in a way few SUVs do. The grille’s aggressive shape is quite a contrast from the rest of the SUV, which has relatively reserved looks.\n\nHow It Drives\nYou’re reminded of the GX’s traditional SUV construction the moment you start driving. It’s not hard to get accustomed to the SUV’s size, but the amount of brake dive and low-speed body roll are a blast from the era of SUVs past. You just don’t encounter it that often anymore, especially in the luxury segment.\n\nOnce you get up to midrange and highway speeds, however, the driving experience evolves into something more contemporary. The ride is comfortable, if a little firm, and the GX tracks with a secure feel whether the roads are clear or snow-covered. There’s a switch on the center console for the adaptive suspension with Normal, Sport and Comfort settings, but ride-quality differences are slight; Sport tightens up the suspension a little and provides more road feel, while Comfort softens the ride some.\n\nThe GX’s sole engine is a 301-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 that works with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the engine is tasked with moving about 5,200 pounds of SUV. The GX doesn’t feel underpowered, but it’s wise to plan your high-speed passes so you have plenty of space to make them. On the highway, the GX cruises easily at 70 mph and the cabin is relatively quiet.\n\nThe GX gets an EPA-estimated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined. The LR4, which has a new supercharged V-6 for 2014, is rated 14/19/16 mpg, while the twin-turbo V-8 ML550 also gets an estimated 14/19/16 mpg. The Q7 offers a supercharged gas V-6, and its estimated gas mileage is 16/22/18 mpg. According to the trip computer in the GX, I got 18.8 mpg during a 158-mile trip that included a lot of highway driving. It was quite cold when I tested the SUV, though, and that may have adversely affected gas mileage. Premium gas is required.\n\nIf you drive anywhere remotely civilized, the GX’s true capabilities will go unused most of the time, but certain situations make you appreciate what this SUV can do. The Chicago region was digging out from more than a foot of snow when I tested the GX, but with 8.1 inches of ground clearance and standard full-time four-wheel drive, driving around on unplowed side streets and alleys was a non-issue. The GX just plowed ahead and made its own path.\n\nInterior\nIt’s a bit of a climb into the driver’s seat, but standard running boards make things easier. Large windows enhance visibility, especially when checking your blind spots.\n\nThe GX’s mostly upscale materials include available mahogany wood trim and premium leather upholstery, but vast amounts of silver-colored trim put a damper on the cabin’s luxury vibe. It covers the middle of the dashboard and center console and is glaringly out of place in a $60,000-plus SUV.\n\nThe front seats offer a large-leather-recliner kind of comfort, but the second row isn’t ideal for adults. The seat slides forward and backward and also reclines, but the bottom cushions are close to the floor, so you sit with your knees angled up and don’t have a lot of thigh support. It’s another reminder of the GX’s body-on-frame platform, a design that’s not typically as space-efficient as the unibody construction used in crossovers.\n\nThe second row has a passenger-side walk-in feature to make third-row access easier, but the third row is small and really fit only for children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMany Lexus models have adopted the automaker’s Remote Touch interface, which features a mouse-like controller that operates a cursor on a dashboard screen, but the GX still uses a touch-screen setup. It might not be as high-tech as Remote Touch, but it’s easier to operate while driving. The touch-screen’s home screen is now configurable and can show up to three different system features, but I would like to see physical fan-speed buttons added to the center control panel so you don’t have to use the touch-screen to make adjustments.\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard, and it was easy to pair my iPhone with the multimedia system. Music quality over Bluetooth is good. However, another editor who tried playing music from his iPhone through a USB port had trouble getting the connection to work.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith all three rows of seats in place there’s only 11.6 cubic feet of cargo room, but that’s still more than the LR4 (9.9) and Q7 (10.9) offer. The GX’s third row nearly touches the rear window, leaving a shallow space for luggage that’s not very usable. Folding the third row increases cargo space to 46.7 cubic feet, and with the second row also folded there’s 64.7 cubic feet. The LR4 (90.3) and Q7 (72.5) both offer more maximum cargo room. The 60/40-split second-row backrest is spring-loaded, which makes it easy to fold but hard to raise — particularly the larger section.\n\nThe GX is one of the few SUVs that still has a swing gate instead of a liftgate. Since it doesn’t go up in the air, shorter people might find a swing gate easier to close, but this design makes it harder to load cargo when parked on a street. Hinged on the passenger side, the wide door opens to the curb and forces you to walk around it to get to the cargo area, which could be a problem if there’s a car immediately behind you. The GX’s considerable ground clearance and body-on-frame construction mean you have to clear a high cargo floor when loading luggage, too.\n\nStorage amenities include a deep center console bin and large cupholders. A large owner’s manual takes up most of the glove box, however.\n\nSafety\nThe GX hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of this writing.\n\nOptional safety features include a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, a wide-view camera system designed to help you see around blind corners, and a forward-collision warning system that monitors the driver’s focus and includes mild autonomous braking and automatic front-seat seat-belt cinching.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOnce commonplace, true luxury SUVs are a dwindling breed as automakers turn to luxury crossovers to give shoppers better on-road driving dynamics and gas mileage. The GX’s capability in extreme conditions is impressive, but so is that of its main competitor, the Land Rover LR4, which offers a more refined driving experience overall for similar money.\n\nIf you can live without real SUV capability, though, one of the models from the vast and expanding luxury crossover segment might be a better match for your everyday driving needs.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe seven-seat GX 460 is Lexus’ midsize truck-based SUV. The luxury vehicle features a V-8 engine, and it competes against models like the Land Rover LR4 and Mercedes-Benz M-Class.\n\nNew for 2012\nMinor changes include new bodyside molding for the base model, storage bin and cupholder lighting and a temperature readout incorporated into the multi-information display.\n\nExterior\nThe GX 460 has a tall stance, and its body sides are accented by large front and rear fender flares. Its face has an uncanny resemblance to Subaru’s Outback wagon, thanks to similar headlights. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nRear window can be opened independently of the gate\n\nInterior\nSeven-person seating in three rows is standard. The second-row bench seat can slide forward and backward for optimal legroom, and the seat’s backrest also reclines. When more cargo room is needed, the standard power-folding third row folds flat with the floor.\n\nThe cabin features a symmetrical dashboard design with a large center control panel finished in silver-colored trim. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard leather seat trim\nStandard heated and ventilated power front seats\nStandard moonroof\nOptional navigation system\nOptional Mark Levinson stereo\nOptional backseat entertainment system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GX’s 4.6-liter V-8 makes 301 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque and teams with a six-speed automatic transmission. The full-time four-wheel-drive system incorporates a low range that’s designed for off-road excursions. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nAvailable adaptive suspension\nMaximum towing capacity of 6,500 pounds when properly equipped\n\n\nSafety\nTen airbags are standard, including frontal airbags, side-impact airbags for the front and outboard second-row seats, front knee airbags and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. Other safety features include:\n\n\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system\nStandard active front head restraints\nOptional Pre-Collision System, which can tighten the front seat belts and ready the brakes for stronger stopping performance",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: Comfortable, quiet and nimbler than the larger and more expensive LX 570, the Lexus GX 460 is an old-school luxury SUV — with all the pros and cons that come along with that.\n\nVersus the competition: The Lexus fits in well with competitors on price and electronic safety equipment, but its onboard multimedia tech, powertrain, packaging and driving dynamics have all been improved upon by others’ more modern offerings.\n\nLuxury SUVs have been around for decades, replacing big luxury sedans as the ultimate in posh, all-weather transportation. Lexus wasn’t the first on the scene, but it didn’t wait long to capitalize on the craze; the GX 460 you see here dates back to 2002. The 2016 model isn’t much different from that SUV. It still rides on a more luxury-oriented, modified body-on-frame (truck) platform that shares some components with the Toyota 4Runner and a Land Cruiser Prado that Toyota sells abroad. It still has full-time four-wheel drive with a Low range that enables it to go places most luxury SUVs can’t. And it still has a big V-8 engine and seating for seven.\n\nChanges from 2015 to 2016 (compare the two here) are limited to some new features for the Lexus Enform Service Connect and Enform Remote concierge services.\nExterior & Styling\nThe  GX 460 received Lexus’ latest styling treatment for the 2014 model year, adding a new spindle grille and LED swoosh-style headlights. In other vehicles, this outrageous prow looks awkward and overdone, but it somehow works on the GX — maybe due to the truck’s already cartoonish proportions.\n\nThe GX looks every bit the traditional SUV that it is, with a short wheelbase and long overhangs front and rear topped off by an upright, boxy cabin. If you’re a fan of the trucky look, the GX should push all your buttons.\nHow It Drives\nPowering the GX is a traditional engine, as well: a 4.6-liter V-8 making an unremarkable 301 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque. It’s smooth and silent — most of the time — announcing its presence with a roar only if you need to call up some big acceleration.\n\nWhen tasked to do it, the Lexus GX460 responds in a relaxed manner to accelerator input, with the truck’s rather unimpressive power output combining with its 5,199-pound curb weight to make for an unhurried but not underpowered pace. Competitors do out-muscle it, however: The GMC Yukon Denali offers up 420 hp from its much bigger 6.2-liter V-8; the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit pumps out 360 hp from its 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; and even the Land Rover LR4 comes up with 340 hp from its smaller, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe GX does have the ability to tow 6,500 pounds. That bests the rating of the Jeep Grand Cherokee but falls short of the abilities of a Yukon or LR4.\n\nPower is routed through a six-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels through a full-time four-wheel-drive system. It has a Torsen limited-slip center differential and a driver-selectable electronic differential lock for when you’d like a bit more control. Toyota’s Crawl Control feature is offered as an optional part of the advanced four-wheel-drive system and, while I didn’t take the GX off-road (as most owners won’t), I’ve sampled this system in other vehicles and can declare it to be most impressive.\n\nWinning stoplight drag races isn’t what the GX 460 is about; it’s about comfortable, luxurious cruising over just about any terrain you throw at it, and it does well with this mission. Its ride is well-damped and smooth, ironing out road imperfections before they disturb occupants. Tall tire sidewalls on 18-inch wheels help with that, but the Lexus’ electronic active suspension systems (including a rear air suspension with automatic load-leveling function) deserve most of the credit.\n\nThe softness does result in a fair bit of body roll in corners, plus forward dive under heavy braking — issues the Lexus Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System doesn’t completely resolve. If you’re used to driving big, old-style SUVs, the dynamics of the GX 460 will be familiar to you. It behaves much like the Land Rover LR4, with a tall, tippy body and large windows, and feels less planted than the wider GMC Yukon or Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nAlong with the old-school ride and handling come some old-school fuel economy numbers: The Lexus GX 460 is EPA-rated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined. Indeed, my week of mixed city and highway driving returned about 16.8 mpg. But that really isn’t any worse than the competition, which stacks up similarly: 15/21/17 mpg for the Yukon Denali, 14/22/17 for the Grand Cherokee V-8 and a truly awful 15/19/16 mpg for the Land Rover LR4. In the Grand Cherokee, you can opt for a smaller gasoline V-6 that changes your numbers to 18/25/21 mpg, or even a truly fuel-efficient 3.0-liter, turbocharged diesel V-6 that returns a thrifty 21/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Lexus GX 460 carries over the traditional SUV feel inside, as well, with a tall and narrow aesthetic that looks as if nothing’s changed since the late 1990s. The color scheme in my test car was appealing, with a high-quality, creamy beige leather and dark brown dash motif that was attractive, but that appeal was offset by cheap-feeling plastics on the center console and doors. For this price, I expect higher-quality materials — not an interior that looks as if it belongs in a much less expensive Toyota that’s been given some wood appliques.\n\nWhile it may not look especially impressive, though, the Lexus LX 460 is quite comfortable, with big seats up front and plenty of room for occupants. Backseat dwellers aren’t as fortunate, with tight legroom and a seating position that’s lower than ideal. The third row is only for children or Olympic gymnasts, given its diminutive dimensions and ingress and egress that are frustrated by the limited motion of the right rear passenger seat’s tilt-and-fold function.\n\nAt speed, the Lexus is supremely quiet, as one expects from a Lexus. Still, the degree to which road and wind noise are muffled is surprising for a vehicle that looks like it was chiseled from a cinder block. Credit goes to thick glass and plenty of sound insulation.\n\nCompared with much of its competition, however, the GX falls short in luxury. The GMC Yukon has a similar interior but, being a larger truck it provides considerably more occupant space. The LR4 is one of the oldest offerings in the segment and it looks it — yet it still wraps much of its interior in high-quality leather and wood, and it offers tons of headroom. The Grand Cherokee is a testament to how well Jeep has maintained its upscale image, with the Summit model featuring a lot of high-quality materials and a more comfortable backseat than the Lexus — but no third-row option.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhile other Lexus products, including its flagship LX 570 SUV, all employ Lexus’ Remote Touch multimedia controller, the GX 460 soldiers on with a touch-screen. This is a good thing, as the Lexus system isn’t bad when you’re not forced to control it with a mouse-like remote. It works quickly, is easy to use while driving and provides everything you’ll need — except Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are not offered and won’t be anytime soon, according to Lexus.\n\nThe standard Lexus Enform multimedia suite provides a concierge service that’s free for your first year and subscription-based thereafter. My test vehicle came with an optional Mark Levinson 17-speaker audio system that sounded pretty terrific, as well as a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system to help keep backseat passengers quiet on longer drives. GMC’s IntelliLink and Jeep’s Uconnect systems are a bit more user-friendly in their operation, but the Lexus isn’t far behind and it beats out the clunky Land Rover system quite handily.\nCargo & Storage\nBeing an SUV, the Lexus GX 460 is ostensibly meant to be able to carry a lot of people and stuff while offering luxurious surroundings. With the third row up, you can indeed carry people, but not a whole lot of stuff; cargo room behind the third row is tight at 11.6 cubic feet of room. That’s just enough for a duffel or two. Fold the third row flat, however, and you’re granted a more spacious cargo area, although Lexus hasn’t published specs on exactly how much room you get. Stow the second and third rows and you get 64.7 cubic feet of room. That’s on the small side for a midsize SUV, given the Grand Cherokee has 68.3 cubic feet and the Land Rover LR4 somehow manages 90.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. That’s just 4.4 cubic feet shy of the GMC Yukon Denali’s 94.7 cubic feet.\n\nWhat truly makes the GX unique is its swing gate door, which opens to the right. The rear window can be raised independently, in the manner of a common liftgate. The swing gate is of mixed utility; on one hand, shorter operators don’t have to reach up to try and grab the overhead door. On the other hand, it provides no shelter from a downpour as you’re trying to load the cargo bay with groceries. It also makes things difficult if you’ve pulled up to a curb on a two-way street and need to load something into the cargo area; the hatch swings the wrong way for that — a holdover from the Lexus’ origins as a Japanese-market, right-hand-drive vehicle.\nSafety\nThe Lexus GX 460 has not been crash-tested. If it ever is, results will be posted here.\n\nUpdates made for the 2014 model year brought a host of modern safety features, such as standard blind spot warning with cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Opt for the Driver Support Package and you’ll get a wide-view front and side camera monitor, adaptive cruise control with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, an attention monitor and the aforementioned off-road Crawl Control system. See all the GX’s standard features here.\nValue in Its Class\nLexus doesn’t give its premium SUVs away cheaply. There are three trims of the Lexus GX 460 available: Base, which starts at $51,730 including destination; Premium, which adds LED fog lights, a perforated leather interior, navigation, heated and ventilated power-assist front seats, heated split-bench rear seats, three-zone climate control and rain-sensing wipers and starts at $56,175; and Luxury, which starts at $63,105 and adds an adaptive suspension, power folding mirrors, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, blind spot monitors with cross-traffic alert, and a power-folding third row.\n\nI tested a Luxury trim with the optional Mark Levinson premium audio system and dual-screen rear entertainment system, and it came to an as-tested price of $66,220. Adding the Driver Support Package, which brings electronic safety features like lane departure warning and Crawl Control, bumps the price up just short of $70,000. Build one your way here.\n\nWhile there are plenty of luxury SUVs to compare with the GX, matching one up exactly is a little challenging given the Lexus’ true truck-style SUV nature. It’s a body-on-frame midsize truck, not a car-based crossover, so that limits the field somewhat.\n\nIn terms of price, luxury accommodations, equipment and abilities, the GMC Yukon Denali is an interesting matchup. It, too, is a body-on-frame truck and, though its proportions put it more in competition with the larger Lexus LX 570, its price makes it a more spacious alternative to the GX 460 — which it out-performs in powertrain, on-board connectivity tech and towing capacity.\n\nThe Land Rover LR4 is an excellent match for the GX, with similar proportions, construction, throwback looks and onboard tech. But it’s likely not long for this world, with the all-new, crossover-like Land Rover Discovery on its way soon.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee may not seem like a direct competitor (as Jeep isn’t a luxury brand), but many people cross-shop the Grand Cherokee specifically against luxury SUVs. That’s why Jeep offers expensive top trims like the Overland and Summit. While it seats only five, the Grand Cherokee has luxurious appointments in its top trims that allow it to easily go head-to-head with the Lexus GX 460 — plus a choice of powertrains, a sophisticated off-road system and plenty of towing capacity. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Lexus GX460 was written in August 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nLuxury SUVs have been around for decades, replacing big luxury sedans as the ultimate in posh, all-weather transportation. Lexus wasn’t the first on the scene, but it didn’t wait long to capitalize on the craze; the GX 460 you see here dates back to 2002. The 2016 model isn’t much different from that SUV. It still rides on a more luxury-oriented, modified body-on-frame (truck) platform that shares some components with the Toyota 4Runner and a Land Cruiser Prado that Toyota sells abroad. It still has full-time four-wheel drive with a Low range that enables it to go places most luxury SUVs can’t. And it still has a big V-8 engine and seating for seven. \n\nChanges from 2015 to 2016 (compare the two here) are limited to some new features for the Lexus Enform Service Connect and Enform Remote concierge services.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe GX 460 received Lexus’ latest styling treatment for the 2014 model year, adding a new spindle grille and LED swoosh-style headlights. In other vehicles, this outrageous prow looks awkward and overdone, but it somehow works on the GX — maybe due to the truck’s already cartoonish proportions. \n\nThe GX looks every bit the traditional SUV that it is, with a short wheelbase and long overhangs front and rear topped off by an upright, boxy cabin. If you’re a fan of the trucky look, the GX should push all your buttons.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the GX is a traditional engine, as well: a 4.6-liter V-8 making an unremarkable 301 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque. It’s smooth and silent — most of the time — announcing its presence with a roar only if you need to call up some big acceleration. \n\nWhen tasked to do it, the GX 460 responds in a relaxed manner to accelerator input, with the truck’s rather unimpressive power output combining with its 5,199-pound curb weight to make for an unhurried but not underpowered pace. Competitors do out-muscle it, however: The GMC Yukon Denali offers up 420 hp from its much bigger 6.2-liter V-8; the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit pumps out 360 hp from its 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; and even the Land Rover LR4 comes up with 340 hp from its smaller, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. \n\nThe GX does have the ability to tow 6,500 pounds. That bests the rating of the Jeep Grand Cherokee but falls short of the abilities of a Yukon or LR4. \n\nPower is routed through a six-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels through a full-time four-wheel-drive system. It has a Torsen limited-slip center differential and a driver-selectable electronic differential lock for when you’d like a bit more control. Toyota’s Crawl Control feature is offered as an optional part of the advanced four-wheel-drive system and, while I didn’t take the GX off-road (as most owners won’t), I’ve sampled this system in other vehicles and can declare it to be most impressive. \n\nWinning stoplight drag races isn’t what the GX 460 is about; it’s about comfortable, luxurious cruising over just about any terrain you throw at it, and it does well with this mission. Its ride is well-damped and smooth, ironing out road imperfections before they disturb occupants. Tall tire sidewalls on 18-inch wheels help with that, but the Lexus’ electronic active suspension systems (including a rear air suspension with automatic load-leveling function) deserve most of the credit. \n\nThe softness does result in a fair bit of body roll in corners, plus forward dive under heavy braking — issues the Lexus Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System doesn’t completely resolve. If you’re used to driving big, old-style SUVs, the dynamics of the GX 460 will be familiar to you. It behaves much like the Land Rover LR4, with a tall, tippy body and large windows, and feels less planted than the wider GMC Yukon or Jeep Grand Cherokee. \n\nAlong with the old-school ride and handling come some old-school fuel economy numbers: The GX 460 is EPA-rated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined. Indeed, my week of mixed city and highway driving returned about 16.8 mpg. But that really isn’t any worse than the competition, which stacks up similarly: 15/21/17 mpg for the Yukon Denali, 14/22/17 for the Grand Cherokee V-8 and a truly awful 15/19/16 mpg for the Land Rover LR4. In the Grand Cherokee, you can opt for a smaller gasoline V-6 that changes your numbers to 18/25/21 mpg, or even a truly fuel-efficient 3.0-liter, turbocharged diesel V-6 that returns a thrifty 21/28/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe GX 460 carries over the traditional SUV feel inside, as well, with a tall and narrow aesthetic that looks as if nothing’s changed since the late 1990s. The color scheme in my test car was appealing, with a high-quality, creamy beige leather and dark brown dash motif that was attractive, but that appeal was offset by cheap-feeling plastics on the center console and doors. For this price, I expect higher-quality materials — not an interior that looks as if it belongs in a much less expensive Toyota that’s been given some wood appliques. \n\nWhile it may not look especially impressive, though, the LX 460 is quite comfortable, with big seats up front and plenty of room for occupants. Backseat dwellers aren’t as fortunate, with tight legroom and a seating position that’s lower than ideal. The third row is only for children or Olympic gymnasts, given its diminutive dimensions and ingress and egress that are frustrated by the limited motion of the right rear passenger seat’s tilt-and-fold function. \n\nAt speed, the Lexus is supremely quiet, as one expects from a Lexus. Still, the degree to which road and wind noise are muffled is surprising for a vehicle that looks like it was chiseled from a cinder block. Credit goes to thick glass and plenty of sound insulation. \n\nCompared with much of its competition, however, the GX falls short in luxury. The GMC Yukon has a similar interior but, being a larger truck it provides considerably more occupant space. The LR4 is one of the oldest offerings in the segment and it looks it — yet it still wraps much of its interior in high-quality leather and wood, and it offers tons of headroom. The Grand Cherokee is a testament to how well Jeep has maintained its upscale image, with the Summit model featuring a lot of high-quality materials and a more comfortable backseat than the Lexus — but no third-row option.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nWhile other Lexus products, including its flagship LX 570 SUV, all employ Lexus’ Remote Touch multimedia controller, the GX 460 soldiers on with a touch-screen. This is a good thing, as the Lexus system isn’t bad when you’re not forced to control it with a mouse-like remote. It works quickly, is easy to use while driving and provides everything you’ll need — except Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are not offered and won’t be anytime soon, according to Lexus. \n\nThe standard Lexus Enform multimedia suite provides a concierge service that’s free for your first year and subscription-based thereafter. My test vehicle came with an optional Mark Levinson 17-speaker audio system that sounded pretty terrific, as well as a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system to help keep backseat passengers quiet on longer drives. GMC’s IntelliLink and Jeep’s Uconnect systems are a bit more user-friendly in their operation, but the Lexus isn’t far behind and it beats out the clunky Land Rover system quite handily.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nBeing an SUV, the GX 460 is ostensibly meant to be able to carry a lot of people and stuff while offering luxurious surroundings. With the third row up, you can indeed carry people, but not a whole lot of stuff; cargo room behind the third row is tight at 11.6 cubic feet of room. That’s just enough for a duffel or two. Fold the third row flat, however, and you’re granted a more spacious cargo area, although Lexus hasn’t published specs on exactly how much room you get. Stow the second and third rows and you get 64.7 cubic feet of room. That’s on the small side for a midsize SUV, given the Grand Cherokee has 68.3 cubic feet and the Land Rover LR4 somehow manages 90.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. That’s just 4.4 cubic feet shy of the GMC Yukon Denali’s 94.7 cubic feet. \n\nWhat truly makes the GX unique is its swing gate door, which opens to the right. The rear window can be raised independently, in the manner of a common liftgate. The swing gate is of mixed utility; on one hand, shorter operators don’t have to reach up to try and grab the overhead door. On the other hand, it provides no shelter from a downpour as you’re trying to load the cargo bay with groceries. It also makes things difficult if you’ve pulled up to a curb on a two-way street and need to load something into the cargo area; the hatch swings the wrong way for that — a holdover from the Lexus’ origins as a Japanese-market, right-hand-drive vehicle.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Lexus GX 460 has not been crash-tested. If it ever is, results will be posted here.\n\nUpdates made for the 2014 model year brought a host of modern safety features, such as standard blind spot warning with cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Opt for the Driver Support Package and you’ll get a wide-view front and side camera monitor, adaptive cruise control with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, an attention monitor and the aforementioned off-road Crawl Control system. See all the GX’s standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nLexus doesn’t give its premium SUVs away cheaply. There are three trims of the GX 460 available: Base, which starts at $51,730 including destination; Premium, which adds LED fog lights, a perforated leather interior, navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, heated backseats, three-zone climate control and rain-sensing wipers and starts at $56,175; and Luxury, which starts at $63,105 and adds an adaptive suspension, power folding mirrors, a leather-and-wood steering wheel, blind spot monitors with cross-traffic alert, and a power-folding third row. \n\nI tested a Luxury trim with the optional Mark Levinson premium audio system and dual-screen rear entertainment system, and it came to an as-tested price of $66,220. Adding the Driver Support Package, which brings electronic safety features like lane departure warning and Crawl Control, bumps the price up just short of $70,000.\n\nWhile there are plenty of luxury SUVs to compare with the GX, matching one up exactly is a little challenging given the Lexus’ true truck-style SUV nature. It’s a body-on-frame midsize truck, not a car-based crossover, so that limits the field somewhat. \n\nIn terms of price, luxury accommodations, equipment and abilities, the GMC Yukon Denali is an interesting matchup. It, too, is a body-on-frame truck and, though its proportions put it more in competition with the larger Lexus LX 570, its price makes it a more spacious alternative to the GX 460 — which it out-performs in powertrain, on-board connectivity tech and towing capacity. \n\nThe Land Rover LR4 is an excellent match for the GX, with similar proportions, construction, throwback looks and onboard tech. But it’s likely not long for this world, with the all-new, crossover-like Land Rover Discovery on its way soon. \n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee may not seem like a direct competitor (as Jeep isn’t a luxury brand), but many people cross-shop the Grand Cherokee specifically against luxury SUVs. That’s why Jeep offers expensive top trims like the Overland and Summit. While it seats only five, the Grand Cherokee has luxurious appointments in its top trims that allow it to easily go head-to-head with the GX 460 — plus a choice of powertrains, a sophisticated off-road system and plenty of towing capacity.

      "expert_review": "When Lexus finally added a third-row seat to a stretched version of the RX SUV, we thought the GX’s days were numbered. You see, the GX is an old-school, truck-based SUV with all the associated shortcomings, such as space and fuel inefficiency. Its main reasons for being included higher towing capacity, off-road ability and a third row (in a Lexus model smaller than the hulking LX 570).\n\nAs it turned out, though, the RX 350L had a smaller third row than the GX, which perversely may give this truck another reason to stick around. We decided to give it a fresh look. I’ll zero in on what you get from this holdout Lexus — and what you might sacrifice.\n\nYou Get Towing\n\nThe primary thing you get from this design that you can’t get from the RX 350L is a high towing capacity: 6,500 pounds, which is just 500 pounds shy of the maximum offered by the larger Lexus LX SUV (see them compared). The RX tops out at 3,500 pounds, as does the Acura MDX, which is a more affordable model that competes with the GX in other ways. As for other non-Lexus choices, the Infiniti QX60 and Volvo XC90 max out at 5,000 pounds of trailer weight (see them compared). The more expensive Mercedes-Benz GLS450 can tow more than 7,000 pounds, as can the five-seat GLE400 and Porsche Cayenne, which are closer to the GX in price. If you want the best of all worlds, the Land Rover Discovery has three rows of seats, can tow an eye-popping 8,201 pounds and costs $53,595 to start — a close match to the base GX 460 at $53,380 (all prices include destination charges). See these four compared.\n\nYou Get Off-Road Capability\n\nBeyond four-wheel drive for foul weather and off-pavement use, there’s very little need for true off-road features, which is why few SUVs have them. In luxury models, off-road abilities seem even less desirable, though that isn’t Land Rover’s or Lexus’ perspective. The main things that distinguish most Rovers and the GX and LX from common SUVs are heavy-duty suspensions and four-wheel-drive systems with an additional Low range for crawling over obstacles. The GX also has adjustable suspension height, though the difference among the three settings isn’t dramatic. Because the four-wheel drive is permanent (there’s no two-wheel-drive operation), most of the controls on the center console will go untouched by most drivers. There are switches to raise and lower the body and activate the transfer case’s 4-Low range, as well as buttons and switches to activate and adjust the optional Crawl Control, which is like cruise control for off-road situations.\n\nYou Get A Workable Third Row?\n\nYour perspective on the GX 460’s third-row seat will depend on whether you compare it with other Lexus models or the rest of the market. The GX and RX defy logic for mid-size SUVs of their respective construction. On paper, I’d expect the new RXL to have a larger third row and the truck-based GX a smaller one, but it’s the opposite: Typical of boxy designs, the GX’s third row has a headroom advantage, with a specified 35.2 inches versus the RXL’s 34.8 inches. Both models have sliding second rows for flexibility, but it’s clear from the second- and third-row legroom specifications alone that the advantage belongs to the GX (34.1 and 29.3 inches, respectively) versus the RXL (30.9 and 23.5 inches). If you want more third-row space from a Lexus, you’ll need to get the LX 570, which has 34.4 inches of legroom for both the second and third rows, plus superior headroom of 38.9 inches.\n\nThe GX’s third-row legroom specification is an inch and a half shy of the QX60’s and 2.6 inches less than the XC90’s. The MDX has slightly less space than the GX with its second row fully back, about an inch and a half more with it slid forward.\n\nIn use, the GX’s third row proves workable for any adult who’s willing to climb back there — and it is a climb.\n\nYou Get a Control System You Won’t Loathe\n\nAdd this to my growing list of backhanded compliments: The GX is old enough that its multimedia system isn’t maddening. Almost all Lexuses have a display in their dashboard controlled by Remote Touch Interface: a mouselike device or touchpad on the center console. Despite their years of revisions, we just don’t like it, and we’re not alone. The GX, however, has a simple touchscreen and — again, because it’s older — doesn’t incorporate the controls for too many essential features.\n\nPerspective is everything sometimes. The serpentine gate through which the gear selector lever slides in older Toyota and Lexus models (including the GX) used to annoy me. Then Lexus and competitors started implementing push-buttons and springy levers instead, and I’ve recognized things can always be worse …\n\nYou Sacrifice Gas Mileage\n\nWith EPA-estimated highway mileage in the teens, the GX 460 is a throwback in the worst way. Its full rating is 15/18/16 mpg city/highway/combined, which is distant from the RX 350L AWD’s 18/25/21 mpg. (The RXL also comes in a hybrid version, the 450h L, which is rated an impressive 29/28/29 mpg.) Like the RX, other car-based SUVs typically rate more than 20 mpg combined. Non-hybrid AWD versions of the MDX, QX60 and XC90 rate as high as 22 or 23 mpg combined.\n\nOther three-row SUVs with higher towing capacities are pretty thirsty, too, but both the Mercedes GLS450 and the Discovery are rated better than the GX, at 18 mpg combined on gasoline. (A diesel Discovery is rated 23 mpg; all other vehicles mentioned here require premium gasoline.) If you can live without the third-row seat, the GLE400 and BMW X5 xDrive40i are rated 20 and 22 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nSome of this conspicuous consumption comes from the GX’s boxy shape and inherent weight disadvantage, but the 4.6-liter V-8 and an automatic transmission with just six gears also play a part. On the upside, the drivetrain behaves very nicely — better than some transmissions with more gears — and a zero-to-60-mph time of 7.8 seconds is more than adequate; it’s even better than the RX 350L AWD’s 8.1 seconds (both Lexus estimates).\n\nYou Sacrifice Handling\n\nOne of the reasons SUVs made the move to unibody construction was to give them more carlike ride and handling. The GX 460 didn’t, and it doesn’t, though it manages to ride reasonably well in a straight line for a body-on-frame model. It’s when you make turns and accelerate or brake forcefully that the GX falls behind competitors, especially the car-based ones. It may have adaptive shock absorbers, load-leveling rear springs and a Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System that’s claimed to combat body lean, but we found the GX’s body to lean easily and frequently. Similarly, it exhibits more nosedive than most vehicles when braking, and there’s a little rear-end squat when the V-8 revs up and digs in.\n\nTo be clear, once you get into taller and larger SUVs, they don’t exactly drive like cars regardless of the platform. Refinement might be there, but they aren’t nimble and sporty. But even with that disclaimer, the GX is a step or two behind.\n\nYou Sacrifice a Liftgate\n\nMost SUVs have a hatch that swings upward — a liftgate. The GX has a swing gate, which is less than ideal because it requires more space behind the vehicle to open. It’s also hinged on the curb side, which means you’re more likely to load cargo from the street side. The only true advantage to a swing gate is that it can hold a spare tire outside the vehicle, keeping it from taking up space inside or compromising ground clearance in the undercarriage. Alas, the GX has run-flat tires, so that doesn’t come into play. Lexus does mitigate the limitations by incorporating a flip-up rear window, and I give them credit for the keyless-entry lock and unlock buttons by the gate release. Many liftgates don’t give you a lock button, requiring you to walk around to the side door or remove the key fob from your pocket. For what it is, the swing gate is modern and well-executed, but it’s a downside overall.\n\nYou Don’t Sacrifice as Much as You Might Expect\n\nThough the inefficiency is baked in, I can’t really accuse Lexus of neglecting this model unduly. It falls behind some Lexuses and competitors in terms of active-safety features and driving aids, but it isn’t devoid of them — and the same could be said of other models on the market that are younger overall but likewise haven’t been updated in a few years. Though the GX’s available adaptive cruise control doesn’t work below 20 mph, I relied on it for hundreds of miles between Chicago and Detroit. It can have lane departure alert where many models now have steering assist, as well. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is also available. As for cameras, it has three rather than the usual four: front, rear and one under the side mirror on the curb side only, which can show where your right front wheel is.\n\nPutting the latest and greatest feature on some but not all models within a brand is common practice, and we can’t say the GX’s shortcomings are all out of the ordinary.\n\nShould I Buy the Lexus GX 460?\n\nIf you’re a Lexus loyalist and you want a more usable third row of seats — without having to buy the full-size LX 570 — the GX 460 might be a choice you can justify. But it comes with substantial downsides that aren’t all necessary if you’re willing to look at other makes. The GX earns its keep primarily as an SUV with three rows of seats that can tow up to 6,500 pounds.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 GX 460 has lots of charm despite its age, but it hasn’t had a major redesign since the 2010 model year, leaving a lot to be desired both on the inside and under the hood. \n\nVersus the competition: The GX 460 can keep up with other cushy-but-capable off-roaders when the pavement ends, but it lacks the interior sophistication of similarly priced rivals.\n\nIf the 2022 Lexus GX 460 were a house, real estate agents would say it has “good bones.” There’s a lot to like about the capable body-on-frame SUV — known outside the U.S. as the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado — but, as with many houses with good bones, the GX 460 needs a gut rehab. Its larger sibling, the Lexus LX 600, underwent a comprehensive redesign for 2022 that updated its platform, powertrain, technology and more; if the GX is going to stick around, getting it the LX treatment should be a priority.\n\nRelated: What’s New With Lexus for 2022?\n\nOur test vehicle was a 2022 GX 460 with a new Black Line optional appearance package that, as its name suggests, blackens the interior and exterior trim; its sticker price was $62,045 (including a $1,075 destination fee). The GX squares off against rivals like the Land Rover Defender and Jeep’s Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L.\n\nBig Ol’ V-8 Engine Is Indeed Big and Old\n\nUnder the hood of the GX is an engine that feels like it’s always been under the hood: a 4.6-liter naturally aspirated V-8. Despite being a V-8, its power figures are relatively modest — 301 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque — and it moves the GX’s 5,100-plus pounds with deliberation. The V-8’s responsiveness is welcome, and its six-speed automatic transmission shifts smartly. With Lexus and parent automaker Toyota moving increasingly to forced-induction engines, however, a big naturally aspirated V-8 like this one doesn’t feel long for this world.\n\nAlso not long for this world is how many miles the GX can travel on a single tank of (premium) gas: The GX has a less-than-stellar 15/19/16 mpg city/highway/combined EPA fuel-economy rating. Even with a 23-gallon fuel tank, that translates to a maximum range of less than 450 miles. Those numbers are, however, par for the course in this class, as both the V-8-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee L and Land Rover Defender 110 are rated similarly, at 17 and 16 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nThat said, both of those SUVs are more powerful than the GX. The GX’s V-8 may just be one of the least powerful V-8s still being sold today. The LX 600 got a turbocharged V-6 in its recent redesign, and it seems high time the GX go the forced-induction route, too.\n\nThe GX 460’s maximum towing capacity is 6,500 pounds, and it comes with built-in trailer sway control. With that towing capacity, a trailer brake controller is probably a good idea (really, if you’re towing and your trailer has its own brakes, it’s always a good idea), but the GX has no integrated controller. If you want one, you’ll have to go the aftermarket route.\n\nWell-Cushioned Ride\n\nThe GX may not be especially powerful, but it makes up for that with stellar off-road potential. An optional Off-Road Package adds extra underbody protection, an improved camera system, a terrain management system and Crawl Control (essentially low-speed off-road cruise control).\n\nYet even without all of that, the GX still has a lot going for it, including excellent outward visibility, more than 8 inches of ground clearance, full-time four-wheel drive, a torque-sensing limited-slip differential, a two-speed transfer case and an electronically locking center differential. Despite not having the Off-Road Package, our test vehicle made short work of heavy snow during our drive, and the standard suspension was nicely cushioned; bumps and potholes never bothered it. Pricier GX models can have an adaptive suspension allowing drivers to choose among Normal, Sport and Comfort settings.\n\nOld and New Interior (But Mostly Old)\n\nThe GX 460’s interior has a bit of a way-back machine feel to it. It’s loaded with physical controls that are easy and intuitive to use, as well as controls I haven’t seen in some time on a Lexus (or a Toyota). Remember rotary dial controls for heated and ventilated seats? What about a toggle switch to change the cabin temperature? If those throwbacks aren’t enough nostalgia, how about a CD player in a luxury vehicle from 2022? While these things may be old, though, they work and they’re intuitive, so I’m not going to complain about it.\n\nWhat I am going to complain about is that Lexus’ Remote Touchpad controller is still around. It’s difficult to use, it’s distracting, and it needs to go. Fortunately, the 2022 GX 460 gets a 10.3-inch touchscreen display (with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), meaning the only thing you need the touchpad for now is its menu button.\n\nIn the GX 460 Black Line, you get a very, very dark interior with matte-black ash wood trim. From certain angles, the matte finish of the wood looked more like upholstery to me, but it’s a nice touch. The interior is nice overall, but it feels more premium than luxury. Both Jeep and Land Rover have the GX beat in this department.\n\nAs for annoyances, materials quality dips somewhat the farther back you go in the GX, but what really takes a dive is interior room. With sliding and reclining seats, the second row is a fine place for adults to be; the seats are somewhat close to the floor, raising passengers’ knees a bit, but not so badly that a long trip would be out of the question. An adult sitting in the tiny third row, however, is out of the question — and that may be true for kids, too. Getting back there was difficult with the second-row bench seat in our test vehicle (captain’s chairs are available), and there’s hardly any space once you’re back there. I recommend keeping the seats folded down and pretending you have a two-row SUV.\n\nSame goes for the cargo area. With the third row in place, there’s hardly any cargo space. Lexus cites 11.3 cubic feet of space, but we measured it at 3.2 cubic feet. Fold the third row down (manually, as in our test vehicle, or powered in pricier GXs), and there’s a useful amount of space behind the second row. Our measurement was 18.5 cubic feet, which is on the low side for something the GX’s size. Lexus reports 46.7 cubic feet. (Our measurements tend to skew lower than manufacturer specs.)\n\nAccessing the cargo area from the rear, however, can be annoying thanks to the GX’s rear swing gate. Rather than a liftgate that’s hinged at the top, the GX’s rear door is hinged on the curb side and swings outward. It means a full-size spare tire can be mounted there, but it also makes it hard to access the cargo area when parked in close quarters. The rear windscreen does flip up independently, but accessing the back through that higher opening could be problematic, particularly with heavy loads.\n\nThe wood trim mentioned above is also found on the steering wheel, meaning the available heated steering wheel warms up only the leather-wrapped portions at 3 and 9 o’clock. Yes, that’s where your hands should be while driving, but some low-speed maneuvers — like, say, backing a cold car out of a parking space — require lots of movement around the wheel, and the wood gets cold. It’s a minor complaint, but a complaint nonetheless.\n\nSafety\n\nThe GX 460 hasn’t yet been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and it doesn’t seem likely that it will be. Should that change, results can be found here and here.\n\nLexus made its Lexus Safety System Plus suite of advanced safety technologies standard on every 2022 Lexus, meaning the GX 460 includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Front and rear parking sensors are also newly standard on the 2022 GX 460.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\n2022 Lexus LX 600 Up Close: First-Class Perks for First and Second Rows; Third Row? Don’t Ask\n2022 Lexus LX 600 Brings Lavish Accommodations for Rough Terrain\nLexus RX: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nMore Lexus News\nGo for a GX?\n\nAssuming the next GX we see will be a redesign, the 2022 GX may be a great choice for buyers looking for a mostly sorted-out luxury SUV. The touchscreen display fixes lots of problems caused by the touchpad controller, there are still lots of physical controls, and given this is the 13th model year of this generation of the GX, Lexus should have worked out most of the manufacturing kinks by now.\n\nOff-roaders looking for a solid starting vehicle should make a note to look for a used 2022 GX 460 in a few years’ time. The GX has robust aftermarket support, and a discounted 2022 GX 460 would make for a great overlander or rock crawler with a few modifications.\n\nThe 2022 GX 460 isn’t the most luxurious vehicle you can buy for $60,000-$70,000, but for that kind of money it is one of the best combinations of luxury and off-road capability out there.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi Q5, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX 350L, Mercedes-Benz GLE\n\nLooks like: A more refined GX 460; the Toyota 4Runner; the Lexus LX 570 shrunk in the wash\n\nDrivetrain: 4.6-liter V-8 producing 301 horsepower and 329 pounds-feet of torque; six-speed automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: TBD, though likely late 2019\n\nLexus has given its mid-size, off-road-capable GX 460 SUV a light facelift for 2020, as well as standard active safety features and some extra off-road tech. The stalwart body-on-frame SUV gets an updated spindle grille that eschews the horizontal bars and lower opening for a faux mesh pattern more in line with the rest of the Lexus lineup.\n\nRelated: 2019 Lexus GX 460 Review: An Aged Model Earns Its Keep for the Wrong Reasons\n\nSpeaking of being in line with the rest of the Lexus lineup, the 2020 GX 460 is the last Lexus model to gain standard Lexus Safety System Plus, completing the brand’s goal of offering standard active safety features on every model.\n\nExterior\n\nThere’s not much to say beyond the changes to the GX’s grille. It’s still a boxy, trucklike SUV in a world of swooping car-based designs. Fortunately, as Cars.com reviewer Joe Wiesenfelder pointed out in his review of the 2019 model, that boxy design does give it a headroom advantage, particularly in the third row, when compared to its more coupelike competitors.\n\nInterior\n\nChanges to the interior are also minimal. There’s a new Rioja Red leather seat color, plus some updates to the multimedia system — though Wiesenfelder found the 2019 model’s older design preferable to current Lexus systems in many ways. One year of Lexus Enform Remote service is included with ownership, giving owners the ability to control some basic features of the car via smartphone, smartwatch or other smart device with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nSame old, same old here, as power still comes from a 4.6-liter V-8 paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. There’s also still the available Crawl Control, a sort of off-road cruise control found on other Lexus and Toyota models. New for 2020 is an Off-Road Package for Luxury trim models that combines multiple camera systems to help plot your course through off-road obstacles, a transmission cooler, fuel tank protection, and the Multi-Terrain Select system that manages throttle and brake response for specific types of terrain.\n\nSafety\n\nLexus made it a goal to have all of its models equipped with standard active safety features, and the 2020 GX is the last vehicle on its roster to gain standard Lexus Safety System Plus, which has automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert, intelligent high-beam headlights and adaptive cruise control.\n\nPricing and on-sale information should follow soon, but expect the 2020 Lexus GX 460 to cost a little more than a comparable 2019 model and to be available toward the latter end of 2019.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Lexus GX 460 is a reminder of how SUVs used to be, with the model being the last V-8-powered SUV remaining in the brand’s lineup. The model is expected to receive a major redesign in the future, but before the GX goes under the knife, Lexus is giving it some updates for 2023. The 2023 GX 460 starts at $57,575, an increase of $300 versus the outgoing model (all prices include a $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus GX 460 Review: Good Bones, But LX Updates Have to Wait\n\nBlack Line Special Edition Returns, Gains New Features\n\nThe GX 460 Black Line Special Edition first made an appearance in 2022, and strong sales prompted Lexus to bring it back for the 2023 model year. Like before, the Black Line builds upon the Premium trim level, adding black accents to both the interior and exterior of the SUV. The package now also comes with a 360-degree camera system that provides drivers with better visibility when maneuvering the big SUV in tight areas.\n\nThe color lineup for the Black Line has also been updated slightly, as Eminent White Pearl replaces Starfire Pearl and joins the exclusive Nori Green Pearl hue. Meanwhile, the Luxury trim gets a standard Mark Levinson Premium Surround Sound Audio system.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Lexus GX 460 is available now. Lexus didn’t make any major changes to the pricing ladder, and the full lineup is listed below. The 2023 GX 460 is still powered by an aging 4.6-liter V-8 engine that makes 301 horsepower mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; four-wheel drive is standard on all trims.\n\nBase: $57,575\nPremium: $58,910\nBlack Line Special Edition: $62,310\nLuxury: $68,230\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Lexus GX 460?\n2020 Lexus GX 460 Remains Refreshingly Resistant to Change\n2019 Lexus GX 460 Review: An Aged Model Earns Its Keep for the Wrong Reasons\nToyota, Lexus Offer 10 Years of Connected Services on Some Models\nMore Lexus News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
