      "expert_review": "The road was rough and rocky, laced with sharp dips and steep inclines, enough to rattle your teeth in most vehicles.\n\nNot so in the Lexus GX 470. The up-market version of the redesigned Toyota 4Runner, the new-for-2003 GX was able to strut its stuff through the desert mayhem with poise and stamina, and a compliant suspension that soaked up all that nastiness.\n\nWhile the Lexus was doing all the work, the people inside were busy marveling at how well it performed and how well it smoothed out the trail. Actually, it seemed rather incongruous and even bizarre to be crunching this high-end status symbol through the washes. Statistically, few drivers will ever experience the GX or any other sport utility vehicle in this environment or anywhere more challenging than a dirt driveway or parking-lot speed bump.\n\nToo bad. Despite its luxury style and trappings, the GX is a rugged vehicle equipped to take the abuse while still delivering the kind of highway ride and handling demanded by upscale SUV drivers.\n\nWhat it is:\n\nThe GX 470 is a new midsize sport utility vehicle for Lexus. Though based on the chassis of the 4Runner, the GX has a completely different body, interior, engine, suspension, drive system and features. Just slightly smaller than the Lexus SUV flagship, the LX 470, the GX fills yet another niche in the broad lineup of sport utilities for Toyota and its luxury division. With an optional third row of seats, GX boasts eight-passenger capability.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nThe most striking difference between 4Runner and GX 470 is the ultra-smooth 4.7-liter V-8 that powers the Lexus, delivering 235 horsepower along with a stump-pulling 320 pound-feet of torque. This refined, 32-valve engine pulls the 4,675-pound GX as if it were a lightweight, while still being docile in traffic and unobtrusive on the highway.\n\nEven under hard acceleration or climbing a steep grade, the engine is remarkably quiet. Gas mileage is in the hopper.\n\nHandling, drivability:\n\nHere is a shining example of how electronics has changed our world and provide the GX with remarkable capability and flexibility. The full-time four-wheel-drive adjusts for wheel spin and steering input automatically. Climbing a steep hill with loose stones, sand and slick bedrock surfaces, the Lexus adjusted easily, crawling uphill with minimal fuss.\n\nThe suspension rises and lowers, making it adaptable for off-roading and can be made softer for comfort or stiffer for handling. There also is an Adaptive Variable Suspension system that continuously changes each shock absorber according to road conditions, speed, steering and braking input and general vehicle movement, while preventing front dive in braking or rear squat in acceleration.\n\nThere also is Downhill Assist Control, which allows the GX to creep down the steepest incline without braking; Hill-start Assist Control, which keeps the truck from rolling back when starting on steep grades; Vehicle Skid Control, which uses throttle and brake inputs to help avoid skids; Active TRAC traction control, which provides the extra traction of locking differentials; Brake Assist, which boosts brake pressure during panic stops; and Electronic Brake Force Distribution, which applies the brakes evenly to each wheel.\n\nOn the road, the GX drives and handles as a Lexus should, civilized and nicely behaved. The sport setting for the suspension is best for pavement, allowing the truck to handle sharply and predictably. Variable-gear rack-and-pinion steering, in which the rack gearing gets wide toward the ends, provides quick response and easy maneuverability.\n\nStyling:\n\nAttractive and understated, the GX 470 avoids the chrome-plated excesses of most of the latest luxury SUVs.\n\nInterior:\n\nLexus always does a nice interior, and the GX is no exception. A very luxurious feel, with soft leather and walnut accents, including a wood-rimmed steering wheel and loads of high-end features. It comes standard with climate control, six-disc CD audio system and a full-range of power and convenience gizmos.\n\nThe optional third-row seat has enough space for three people, as long as they’re not too big. The seat splits in the middle and folds up and out of the way on either side for cargo loading, although the folded seat halves still intrude on cargo space.\n\nThe test truck included a rear video system with DVD player, and a superb Mark Levinson audio system. The optional GPS navigation system includes Lexus Link emergency communication system.\n\nThe video display combines navigation, audio and climate controls, a setup that I always find troublesome. There’s too much fiddling and switching required for such things as audio or climate display.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe GX 470 is a luxury vehicle with loads of features and priced accordingly. Base price is a significant $44,925. The test truck included the navigation and audio upgrade, $2,700; DVD system, $1,560; third-row seating with air-conditioning, $2,030; trailer hitch, $430; cargo mats, $92; and shipping $575. The total is $52,312.\n\nBottom line:\n\nGX 470 is another tour de force from Lexus, the best-selling luxury brand in the United States. It combines excellent road manners, full luxury and performance features and real off-road capability. Expensive, but loaded with value.\n\nLexus GX 470\n\nVehicle type: Eight-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, four-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $44,925.\n\nPrice as tested: $52,312.\n\nEngine: 4.7-liter V-8, 235 horsepower at 4,800 rpm, 320 pound-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 109.8 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,675 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 15 city, 18 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nOn- and off-road performance.\n\nAdvanced features.\n\nOverall refinement.\n\nLows:\n\nMediocre gas mileage.\n\nVideo-display issues.\n\nExpensive options.",

      "expert_review": "If the baby Lexus SUV, the RX 330, is too carlike for you, and the top-of-the-line model, the LX 470, is a bit of overkill, then you just might want to consider one of my favorites — the GX 470, which is positioned midway between the two.\n\nThe biggest difference between the GX 470 and the smaller RX 330 isn’t just the price; the GX is a real truck-based SUV that has lots of luxury features, and whose price makes it a bit more practical than the LX 470 and other more-expensive competitors.\n\nStarting at $46,225 (plus $650 freight), our test vehicle for the week — the 2005 GX 470 — offers true off-road capabilities that are lacking in the RX 330. That’s because while the RX 330 is based on the chassis of the Toyota Camry/Lexus ES 330 sedans, the GX 470 is a truck underneath, and is designed for all type of weather and all road surfaces.n With this SUV, if you’re so inclined, the fun begins where the pavement ends. You can take it just about anywhere.\n\nToyota took its newest-generation 4Runner, which debuted for 2003, and created the GX 470 as a fancier Lexus version to give luxury SUV consumers an option to such vehicles as the Mercedes-Benz M500 and the BMW X5, both of which also are heavy-duty luxury SUVs that can be taken far off-road. For 2005, the GX 470 also competes directly against the new Land Rover LR3, which essentially the same starting price and the same kind of on- and off-road capabilities. As the more-expensive LX 470 — $65,000-plus — competes directly against the new Range Rover Sport and the higher-priced Range Rovers, the GX 470 is positioned directly opposite the LR3.\n\nThe current 4Runner is the latest version of the venerable and long-running Toyota sport utility line that originally (in the mid-80s) was nothing more than a compact Toyota pickup with the bed closed in to add a second seat and protected cargo area. Some critics of the idea of creating another Lexus sport utility from the new 4Runner thought that the better choice would be to create a third Lexus SUV model from the Toyota Sequoia, which is a truck-based vehicle designed to emulate the Ford Expedition.\n\nWe still may see such a Lexus — Toyota officials have said that their new San Antonio truck plant, which opens next year, eventually might also build a new full-size Lexus SUV.\n\nBut for now, we have the GX 470, and if you want a vehicle like the 4Runner but with a bit more standard content and the presitious Lexus name, this is as good as it gets.\n\nIn its third year, the GX 470 got a few changes for 2005, including a bit more power for the 4.7-liter I-Force V-8 engine — up to 270 horsepower from last year’s 235. This is a version of the V-8 engine also used in the Toyota Tundra pickup and the LX 470, as well as in the new 4Runner (the first V-8 in that line).\n\nThe extra power comes from adding variable valve timing with intelligence, as well as a new electronic throttle-control system, the company said. Torque also was boosted slighty, to 330 foot-pounds, up from 320 last year.\n\nAlso new for ’05 is a sport package ($1,800, included on our test model, that gives the GX 470 black bird’s eye maple interior trim, chrome exhaust tip, and a new “kinetic dynamic suspension.” smoked front and rear light bezels, as well as 17-inch alloy wheels and a roof rack, both with a dark-graphite finish.\n\nThe kinetic suspension uses a “simple hydraulic-control system acting on both front and rear stabilizer bars” to reduce “the degree of roll stiffness” in response to varying road conditions, the company said in a technical description of the system.\n\nThe optional navigation system ($3,050), which also was included on our vehicle, comes with Bluetooth wireless capability for 2005.\n\nWith its decent styling and Toyota/Lexus’ legendary quality, the GX 470 is a great choice for luxury SUV buyers who want a vehicle that is considerably more rugged the the car-based crossovers such as the Infiniti FX45, yet still very refined.\n\nWhile the RX 330 is favored by female buyers or primary drivers, more than half of GX 470 buyers or primary drivers are men, with a median age in the mid-40s, and most of them married. At this price, the car attracts consumers whose average household incomes range from $150,000 to $210,000, the company said.\n\nAlthough most people are loathe to take a $50,000-plus vehicle off road, one of the top selling points for the GX 470 is that it can go just about anywhere at just about any time, thanks to its full-time four-wheel drive, which includes low-range gearing for serious hill-climbing or mud-running. Lexus owners typically enjoy such leisure activities as snow skiing, so they’ll appreciate a vehicle such as the GX 470, which can get them to thje slopes during the middle of winter.\n\nHelping the GX 470 make its way over rugged trails are such features as its torque-sensing center differential and a hill-descent feature that allows the vehicle to crawl safely down steep trails with no braking necessary. There also is a special hill-hold feature that will keep the vehicle from rolling backward (with no pressure on the brake pedal) if the vehicle is paused on a steep uphill grade. The vehicle has a standard body-on-frame truck platform, but nevertheless is designed to ride like a car on the highway.\n\nThere is room for up to eight people in the GX 470 with the optional third-seat package ($2,030), which also includes a rear air conditioning unit. That’s an improvement over the previous-generation 4Runner, which had no third seat capability. The GX 470 is 188.2 inches long — compared with 192.5 for the LX 470, and it weighs 915 pounds less than the LX. That means that with the same engine, there is a bit more zip because there is less weight to move down the highway.\n\nThe engine is connected to a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission, which is shared with the 4Runner. In fact, the whole vehicle is very close to what you get in a 4Runner Limited model, which sells for about $9,000 less than the base price of the GX 470.\n\nIf saving money is more important than any perceived status you might get from the Lexus name, you could opt for the 4Runner. Either way, you can be assured that you are getting a quality vehicle that will hold its value longer than many other brands.\n\nOur review model, with just about everything you can get on the GX 470, rang up at $55,538. But really, you can get a very nice GX 470 without all the extra gadgetry for the $46,225 base price. Among the other extras on our vehicle was a rear-seat DVD entertainment system ($1,560), with a pair of wireless headphones and remote control. The LCD screen folds down from the ceiling. This is great for the kids, particularly on long trips. The navigation system also brought a wonderful Mark Levinson audio system, which includes a 14-speaker, 240-watt premium stereo with a six-disc CD changer in the glove box.\n\nStandard equipment on the GX 470 includes the fulltime four-wheel drive, rear adjustable height control with automatic leveling, four-wheel power disc antilock brakes, 17-inch alloy wheels with mud and snow tires, front and side airbags, vehicle stability control, theft-deterrent system, automatic headlights with integrated foglights, rain-sensing intermittent wipers, rear wiper and washer, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather interior with bird’s-eye maple trim, heated/power front seats, power tilt and telescopic steering column, one-touch power up/down windows, power/heated outside mirrors with manual fold-away, overhead console with storage and map lights, cruise control, power door locks with remote control, and a separate rear-seat audio system (allows the rear passengers to listen to something other than what the folks in front are listening to, and is separate from the rear DVD system).\n\nCargo space is limited with the third seat in place — just 13.2 cubic feet — which could be a problem on a long trip with a full crew. But if you don’t need the rear seat, fold it to the side to increase cargo space to 39.8 cubic feet, or remove it entirely to get 49.7 cubic feet of space.\n\nA tow package on the GX 470 allows it to tow up to 6,500 pounds.\n\nFuel economy is not as bad as it is in some luxury SUVs. EPA ratings are 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the highway.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Maybe I’m spoiled, but I like nice things. I especially like nice cars with rich leather seats, premium sound systems, powerful engines and super-cool features. These are some of the things that make this mama happy. One would assume that the 2009 Lexus GX 470 would fall right into the Things-I-Like category, but it left me scratching my head. I just don’t understand who Lexus is targeting with the GX 470.\n\nSeveral of its features make the GX seem like a throwback to the ’80s. Yes, the GX has seats aplenty and luxuries galore, but there’s nowhere to put my mommy gear. Folding the third row was a workout for both my upper body and my higher reasoning skills. Luxury is supposed to make things easier, right? Well, in the GX luxury seems a bit dated.\n\nDriving the GX was easy, though. The ride was smooth as silk, and there was enough power to really tempt me. Its huge V-8 engine humbled hills; the full-time four-wheel drive left lesser cars in the dust. Its gas mileage was a reflection of that powerful engine, but really, it wasn’t as bad as I expected with its EPA-estimated 14/18 mpg city/highway. Of course, I got 13 mpg in combined driving, but I was testing out the GX’s abilities to pass uphill. That’s not exactly economical driving. What’s not so economical was the GX’s recommended 91-octane premium gas. Oh well – luxury rarely comes cheap.\n\nThe ride in the GX was luxurious, too; it wasn’t even slightly truckish. It was so smooth, in fact, that it seemed almost unconnected to the road. It was more like flying or floating than driving. Personally, I’d like a bit more feedback from the tires, but I can’t really complain about an SUV being too smooth (well, I can, but…). There was some of that roly-poly feeling in the turns, which reminded me that I was in a large SUV, and maneuvering around parking lots was a bit of a trial.\n\nExterior\n\nThere’s no argument that the GX 470 is a pretty SUV. This was a full-sized mama with curves in all the right places. The GX was big without being bulky or obnoxious, like some of the other huge SUVs on the road. Instead, it’s softly rounded and delicately accessorized. The GX was way too classy to be dripping in chrome, which only appears on the front grille, door handles and in a single strip under the windows. The rest of the sparkle comes from a gorgeous metallic paint. My test car was a fabulous Salsa Red Pearl, a deep red that was fun without being over the top.\n\nThe passenger doors opened easily, even for the little ones, and stayed where you put them. The armrest on the rear door worked as a grab handle when kids were climbing in, and the running boards meant that the higher climb-in height was still manageable. In the back, a flat stepping area gave solid footing to passengers climbing into the third row.\n\nThe rear cargo door, however, was one of those things that made me wonder what Lexus was thinking. The door opened to the side instead of upward like most SUVs. It’s really odd and rather awkward, because the rear door is big. Most luxury SUVs have a power liftgate feature that makes opening the cargo door a breeze, but the GX is its own woman. Er, person? Car? Let’s just say it’s unique.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe GX’s interior looked and felt great with its comfy, heated leather seats and gorgeous wood trim, but it fell short when it came to usable space and practical features.\n\nIf you’re a smoker, then the GX is your friend with a cigarette lighter and three ashtrays. If, however, neither you nor your children smoke, those ashtrays aren’t much help. The ashtray in the front was the only place to set my cell phone, as I usually have a couple of beverages sitting in the cupholders. The center console came with two fold-out cupholders; if they’re in use, there’s absolutely nowhere to stash anything else. When I picked up my test GX, the wireless headphones were stored in the center console. I think that’s the intended storage location, considering the way the headphones fold and fit perfectly into the bin. I found it more helpful to put them in the bins in the rear-passenger doors. That way the kids could reach the headphones by themselves, and I had somewhere to stick that vital pack of baby wipes.\n\nThe stereo and rear entertainment systems in the GX felt either dated or thrown in. The audio system had a cassette player. Wow. The optional navigation system had a nice-looking color touch-screen that made managing audio systems and Bluetooth connections easy. There was an AUX port for plugging in MP3 players, but no USB port. The AUX port was at the bottom of the center stack, which meant the cord was exposed. Since there’s nowhere to stash your iPod, things got messy between all the cords and chargers. In the rear, there was an available DVD system with wireless headphones, but it didn’t seem well-planned. I’m not a big fan of the system because the DVD player is on the ceiling of the backseat area. I didn’t feel safe loading a movie while driving, and younger kids can’t reach the DVD player to do it themselves.\n\nThe GX’s third row was another thing that left me scratching my head. Technically there’s seating for three people back there, but only three very small people would be comfortable. In fact, I couldn’t even tell there was a center seat in the third row because it was so small. There wasn’t much legroom because the second row didn’t slide forward.\n\nMy main complaint about the third row was the way it folds. The seat is split 50/50 and each seat folds to the side instead of down into the floor. It took folding, hooking and strapping each seat to stow the third row; once it’s stowed, visibility out the rear side windows is completely zero. I’d have loved to have kept the third row in place, but then there’s very little cargo space. I managed to carefully stack a modest grocery run back there, but when I got home and opened the cargo door, the bags toppled out. Not cool.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nThere were plenty of safety features in the Lexus GX, but they weren’t exactly cutting-edge. Newer safety features like a blind spot warning system and a radar-based collision preparation system haven’t made their way to the GX.\n\nWhat you do get is airbags, including front- and side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows but not the third row. It also had antilock brakes, stability control, traction control and emergency brake assist that senses panic braking and helps stop the SUV.\n\nThe seat belts in the GX fit well and were easy to manage, even for little fingers. The center seat belt comes out of the top of the seat, so it won’t impede your visibility. The Latch connectors are clearly marked and easily accessed; a Velcro flap keeps them covered when they’re not in use. An available tracker system helps police recover the GX if it should be stolen.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The ride is as smooth as baby’s bottom.\n\nIn School: Running boards and flat step-in areas make it easy for little ones to climb aboard.\n\nTeens: Teens won’t be thrilled by the lack of legroom and rear charging points.",
