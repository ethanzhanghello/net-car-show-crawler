      "expert_review": "I don’t know about you, but I have enough excitement in my life — familymatters, girlfriend matters and, of course, the awful four-letter word,w-o-r-k.\n\nSo it’s always a welcome relief at the end of the day, after having racedwith the rats, to strap into a soothing sophisticated piece of machinery likethe Lexus ES 300.\n\nThis is not a car for Dale Earnhardt wannabes. This is a car for swift,comfortable transport. Even if it’s not the most daring sheet-metal sculptingjob under the sun, this car sets the standard at the bottom end of the luxurycar field. This is the car the other automakers aim for.\n\nAnd this year, Toyota has raised the standard.\n\nThe styling is no radical departure, but then Lexus customers aren’t aradical bunch. The styling is an improvement over the previous model, however.A rounded greenhouse and crisper lines around the flanks help move it awayfrom its previous blobby looks. The sculpted hood helps give the front apowerful presence.\n\nIt might not look longer, but it is, having grown 2.4 inches. According toToyota, this gives the car more legroom than a BMW 5-series or Mercedes-BenzE-class. Certainly, it’s roomier than the previous model, particularly forrear-seat passengers.\n\nBut cars aren’t bought for legroom alone. There are many factors. In thisregard, the ES 300 is like an obedient butler, catering to your every whim.\n\nThe engine, Toyota’s familiar four-cam, 24-valve 3.0-liter all-aluminum V6,gets its power bumped up to 200 horses and 214 foot-pounds of torque. Theresult is sufficient to briskly whisk away worries (except for, say, speedingtickets. Top speed is 141 mph. Zero-to-60 takes 8.6 seconds). In typical Lexusfashion, there’s little to be heard here but silence. There’s no road noiseand little engine noise. Forget tire noise. This isolation chamber is free ofrattles and bothers.\n\nThe “Adaptive Variable Suspension” has settings from cushy to kidney belt.This car seems happier at thesofter and of the spectrum, although thesportier setting eliminates the body lean present in other modes. Braking isgreat, courtesy of four-wheel discs with anti-lock. The ride overall iscomfortable and the handling competent, with the adaptive suspension provingmore useful than gimmicky.\n\nInside, the refined feel of the suspension and drive train is mirrored inthe interior layout. Comfy front bucket seats covered in optional leathertreat its occupants better than some the world’s finest thrones. Heaters areavailable for the optional leather seats.\n\nThe center console design is one for which Lexus has set the standard, onethat other luxury marques have copied. It is a study in making the complicatedlook simple, housing climate controls and an excellent 195-wattAM/FM-cassette/CD player. Controls are easy to understand and operate. The oneglitch is the omission of an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, an important onefor the ES 300’s older customers.\n\nThe best part is tha t this new ES 300 feels better than ever. The chassisis stiff, which pays dividends when you open the power moon roof. Safety isimproved as well, with stronger bumpers, standard anti-lock brakes andtraction control.\n\nIf there’s anything that’s missing, it’s glitches. But then, that’s whyLexus, and the ES 300, constantly top the J.D. Power owner satisfactionsurveys. That’s the joy of this car: Like that dutiful servant, this ES 300helps make the world a little easier to get along in. You might even want toname it Jeeves.\n\nThat stated, it can also be said the Lexus lacks character, but we’resplitting hairs here — after the day I just had, this car goes down like hotchocolate after the storm of the century.\n\nLexus ES300Standard: 3.0-liter double-overhead cam 24-valve V6, four-speed electronicallycontrolled transmission, four-wheel independent MacPherson-strut suspension,front and rear stabilizer bars, four-wheel power-assisted disc brakes withanti-loc , 205 /65R15 V-rated tires with aluminum wheels, dual front air bags,dual outside power mirrors with defoggers, auto on-off headlights, theftdeterrent system, walnut interior trim, power windows with driver’s side autodown, retained accessory power, power door locks, keyless entry, power frontseats with driver’s lumbar support, tilt wheel, overhead console, front andrear cupholders, automatic climate control, 195-watt, seven-speakerAM/FM-cassette audio system, rear glass-mounted radio antenna.Options: Leather trim package with driver’s seat memory, in-dash six-CDchanger, power moon roof, “Adaptive Vehicle Suspension,” wheel locks, floormats, trunk mat.Base price: $29,900As tested: $34,922EPA rating: 19 mpg city, 26 mpg highwayTest mileage: 21 mpg",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus ES300 – and before it, the Lexus ES250 – has always been the entry-level Lexus, based on the platform of its corporate cousin, the Toyota Camry. Lexus has done a good job of making that connection less than obvious, never more successfully than with the all-new 2002 ES300.\n\nSince the car was new for last year, it enters 2003 with only one notable addition: Optional power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals. Besides making for a more comfortable driving position, adjustable pedals allow people of varying heights to sit the recommended distance from the steering wheel and its airbag.\n\nThe ES went on sale in September, 1989, as the ES250, and then two years later, became the ES300. The numbers indicate the engine size – the ES300 has a 3.0-liter V-6. The 1997 ES300 was the third-generation model, and last year, the new ES was the fourth generation.\n\nEach model ES can only be as good as the current Camry is, since so many parts are shared. The 2002 Camry is an excellent car, and consequently, so is the ES300. Last May, the ES300 outsold the Cadillac DeVille, making the Lexus the best-selling luxury car in the U.S.\n\nUnlike the Camry, the Lexus has no available four-cylinder engine or manual transmission. The only powertrain available is the 210-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6, with a responsive five-speed automatic transmission. The Camry is built in the U.S., but the Lexus is built in Japan, where it is sold as the Windom.\n\nWhile there are obvious differences outside, it’s inside where Lexus justifies charging you more. (About $2,500 more over a loaded Camry, but that can vary according to options.) The ES300 interior is rich and handsome and exceptionally comfortable.\n\nThe test car had a $2,130 “Premium Package” that added leather trim and a six-disc CD changer to the stereo, plus a wood-and-leather steering wheel that added $330, and was worth it. There’s nothing wrong with the Camry interior, but the company saved the class for the Lexus.\n\nThe rear seat in the ES300 is pretty accommodating for two adults, and passable for three. There’s 14.5 cubic feet of trunk space, good for a car this size.\n\nOn the road, the ES300 gives a good ride, but it isn’t as plush as some luxury cars. Handling is crisp, enhanced by the standard 16-inch tires and wheels, but there’s some mild body roll when asked to corner sharply. Overall, it’s a nice compromise between comfort and agility. The test car had the optional ($650) anti-skid control, which uses onboard sensors to detect when the car is skidding, then it applies individual braking until control is regained.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 is a superb engine, and with the five-speed automatic transmission, acceleration is above average. Fuel mileage isn’t – it’s rated at 21 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. The engine prefers premium gasoline, but runs fine on regular.\n\nThe 2003 ES300 is, as the ES models before it, essentially viceless; if there is a cri ticism, it’s that it is lacking personality. People who complain about that might prefer the Lexus IS300 – it’s more than a foot shorter, but much sportier.",

      "expert_review": "I met the Lexus ES 300 a decade ago, when we both were young and looking for different things.\n\nIt wanted stardom, but it was a celebrity without talent, a gilded remake of the workaday Toyota Camry sedan.\n\nI wanted spark and authenticity. The first ES 300 had none. We parted company, and remained apart over the intervening years.\n\nChance brought us together again. I inadvertently agreed to put the 2001 ES 300 on the test schedule. I was thinking BMW, as in 330i sedan, when the scheduler was saying “Lexus.” I realized my error when the car arrived — too late to say “No” without embarrassment, or inconvenience.\n\nWe were together for a week, the initial portion of which I spent in denial. The new ES 300 was good, discernibly better than its predecessor. It no longer looked or felt like a Camry, though it shared many Camry components, including structural elements and electrical switches.\n\nBut bias has its comfort zone. It prefers not to be disturbed by facts or other developments that challenge its hold on the mind and soul. Yet, some things are hard to ignore. They include excellent ride and handling, tightness, the beauty of polished California walnut trim, and the rich smell and feel of supple leather — all of which are part of the new ES 300.\n\nThe car also had something the Camry never had — sex appeal.\n\nMy wife, for example, never marveled over a Camry, which she likened to a shopping cart. But she drove the new ES 300 and fell in love. “I could drive it forever,” she said.\n\nWhen your wife says something like that, and says it with a mischievous smile that seems to be saying something more, you take note. You say, “Yeah, baby. Ummm, hmmm. Wanna go for a ride?” I mean, if you have any sense, you say that, which is what I said. And, so, we went for a long ride.\n\nIt was a great date. A cheap one, too. The ES 300 didn’t use much gas. It got a teeny bit more than 26 miles per gallon on the highway — not bad for a car equipped with a 210-horsepower V-6 engine. The car ran well on regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nIt occurred to me that I no longer cared that the ES 300, stripped of its finery and mechanical tweaks, was just a good, solid family car. Hot-rodders won’t like it, but that’s okay. They can buy the flashier Lexus IS 300 sport sedan and pretend they’re driving a BMW 3-series model, or something better.\n\nBut I no longer need such pretense, which is fruitless anyway in comparisons of Lexus and BMW. The two makes are palpably different. Lexus is more genteel, more accommodating. It is to driving what a southern drawl is to speech. BMW is excruciatingly precise, demanding. Its speech is terse, guttural. It does not pretend to be anything else, let alone a Lexus.\n\nNo matter. Things worked out with the new ES 300. I did not want to argue or fight with or conquer this car. I wanted comfort, beauty and a goo d ride. It gave me what I wanted. I was happy.",

      "expert_review": "Lexus’ antidote to the serene driving experience of the front- wheel-drive, Camry-derived ES 300, is the rear-wheel-drive IS 300. For 2002, Lexus has introduced a special model, the Sportscross.\n\nThe Sportscross isn’t as large as a wagon, nor is it as small as a hatchback. Rather it falls somewhere between the two in size. While the car shares the sedan’s 105.1 inch wheelbase, it’s a half- inch longer. Overall size is about that of a Toyota Corolla. But the Sportscross possesses a sleeker shape and funkier demeanor. It’s more distinctive than the sedan.\n\nThe Sportscross also shares its powerful, refined 215-horsepower 3-liter V-6 hooked to a five-speed automatic transmission. It features electronically-operated manual shift controls similar to those on the larger Lexus GS sedans. Using steering-wheel mounted buttons, a driver can shift manually without doing any clutch work. The six-speed manual available on the IS300 sedan is not offered on the Sportscross.\n\nIt’s the combination of small size and powerful\n\ndrivetrain coupled with an expertly tuned suspension that makes the Sportscross such a blast to drive. The ride is quite firm, and the P225/45R17 tires that do so much for grip also communicate more information than is customary in a Lexus. Wet weather can cause the performance-oriented tires to lose their footing, but Vehicle Stability Control does a good job of keeping things safe.\n\nThe interior also is a carryover from the IS 300 sedan. The extremely supportive seats are covered in a velour-like fabric. The dash has a sporty feel, with a chronograph-style instrument cluster that is a triumph of form over function.\n\nThe rear cargo area can be expanded, thanks to split rear fold- down seats. A retractable cargo cover and a false floor add space for hiding valuables.\n\nThe car starts at $32,305. For those of you who equate size with prestige, this won’t seem like a bargain. But for those of you who like to drive, you might think otherwise.\n\nIf you want this engaging little Lexus, grab one fast. Lexus plans to import a mere 5,000 annually.\n\nThe rest of you will have to settle for a more sedate entry- level Lexus.\n\nLexus ES 300\n\nEngine: 3-liter V-6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nTires: P215/60VR16\n\nWheelbase: 107.1 inches\n\nLength: 191.1 inches\n\nWidth: 71.3 inches\n\nWeight: 3,439 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 14.5 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $31,505\n\nAs tested: $39,935\n\nEPA rating: 21 city, 29 highway\n\nTest mileage: 23 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: Tsutsumi, Japan",

      "expert_review": "In some quarters of the automobile business, it’s been said that Lexus has redefined the luxury car market.\n\nWith its series of cars during the 1992 model run, from an ES 300 sedan on the bottom of the price scale to an LS 400 on the top, Lexus cut a wide swath among the makers of upscale automobiles.\n\nParticularly notable was the highly styled, high- performance SC 400 coupe that won Motor Trend magazine’s 1992 Car Of The Year award. Not one to tinker with an eminently successful formula, Lexus has chosen for the time being to refine its established models for 1993.\n\nThe next new model will be a GS 300 sports sedan that will come out around March of next year. Details still are a bit on the cloak-and-dagger side. But Dave White, general manager of Tom Wood Lexus, said, “It will lie between the ES 300 and the LS 400 and be a rear-wheel drive.”\n\nUnder the present scheme of sedans, the ES 300 is a front-drive and the LS 400 a rear-drive.\n\nA little Lexus history\n\nThe Lexus nameplate was established in 1987 during its January introduction at the 1988 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show. Its Midwest debut was the next month at the Chicago Auto Show.\n\nSince then Lexus, which is a division of Toyota Motor Co., has never looked back. By the time all the numbers were tallied in December 1991, Lexus had become the No. 1 luxury import, selling 71,206 cars. For 1992, White says it looks like the total is going to be about 90,000.\n\n“We’ll build on that for these ’93 models,” he said. “We’re projecting (for Lexus) about 100,000 cars.”\n\nNew features for ’93\n\nThe ’93 automobiles have been updated with new electronic support systems, cellular telephone wiring, and passenger air bags. An automatic locking retractor system has been added for passenger and rear-seat safety restraints.\n\nAll the models are pre-wired for an optional cellular telephone system that has to be one of slickest accessory items around. Called the Portable Plus cellular telephone, the phone features voice activation that makes carrying on a conversation while driving safer and easier.\n\nWith short verbal commands, the phone will dial preprogrammed calls without a driver having to take his or her hands off the steering wheel.\n\n“The cars incorporate a lot of suggestions from the customers, ” White said.\n\nLexus from the outset went the high-tech route in its power plant offerings, with the 300 series cars utilizing 3.0-liter in- line 6 and V-6 engines, and the 400 series sporting 4.0-liter V-8s.\n\nThe upscale version among the 300 cars is the in-line 6 SC coupe, which is a reversal of traditional design in that it is bigger than the V-6 sedan. Wheelbases are 105.9 inches for the SC 300 coupe vs. 103.1 inches for the ES sedan. Overall length for the coupe is 191.1 inches against 187.8 inches for the four-door.\n\nThe 400 cars conform more to accepted design parameters in that the LS sedan at 191.1 inches of overall length is 5.4 inches longer than the SC coupe. The two automobi les are aimed at different customer bases, with the LS designed to provide the conveniences of family luxury motoring.\n\nThe sedan’s wheelbase of 110.8 inches is the same as in ’92, but at 3,858 pounds it’s almost 100 pounds heavier than its predecessor.\n\nCoupe offers speed, style\n\nThe coupe is for those who want to fly, but be ensconced in all the trappings of the good life while doing so. It’s not too difficult to see how it captured the Import Car Of The Year award.\n\nRather than try to carve an SC coupe out of an LS sedan, stylists at Toyota’s design center in Newport Beach, Calif., gave the model its own look. Its low rounded nose, long hood, flowing window and roof lines, and short rear deck are a real eye catcher.\n\nFor the interior, there is a strong Lexus family aura with a dash of sports flavor so that the leathers and woods look as if they are right at home in a high-speed sports-orientedautomobile.\n\nUnder the hood there is a four-cam, four-valves-per-c ylinder V-8 good for 250 horsepower. It’s the same engine as is in the LS, but the coupe’s lighter weight lets all those horses paw the ground in a rather impressive fashion.\n\nThe coupe at 3,585 pounds has a 273-pound advantage over the sedan, and that lets the fliers achieve a ground-level velocity of 0- 60 miles per hour in 6.9 seconds. Top speed is 150 mph.\n\nIf you really want to get technical in the performance department, run the SC 400’s optional rear spoiler. The coefficient of drag with the spoiler is 0.31. Without the spoiler it’s 0.32.\n\nFollowing the European concept, the coupe has the overall design of a high-speed touring car. Dirt-track racing may be lots of fun, but it doesn’t quite measure up to zipping along while surrounded by leather, wood, and symphonic sounds of the stereo.\n\nBecause it’s a rear-drive, the 400 coupe is an automobile that you can play racer with, but primarily owners are not of the helmet-and-goggles set. Not unexpectedly, White says the SC 400 coupe’s price will run between $42,000 and $46,000.\n\nHigher-priced models sell\n\nIn most automobile lines, the lower-priced vehicles are the major sellers. But not Lexus. White says the average price for an ES 300 will be about $28,000 and rise to $52,000 for the most expensive LS 400.\n\nHowever, sales are pretty evenly split between the LS 400 and the ES 300 sedans. The national split for the ’93 cars is expected to be 40,000 400s, 40,000 300s, and 20,000 coupes.\n\n“That’s 40 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent” White said. “And that’s just about what we’re selling.”",

      "expert_review": "Is the Toyota Lexus ES250 simply a glorified Toyota Camry?\n\n“The media thought so more than our buyers,“ said J. Davis Illingworth, general manager of Lexus.\n\nThe fact both were built off the same platform and featured the same engine and transmission and bore styling that played up the heritage helped lead to charges that the Lexus was a Camry for several thousands of dollars more.\n\nToyota and Lexus want to put the Camry/ES250 kinship twinship to rest. So two years after it was introduced as a 1990 model, the Lexus ES250 is being replaced in the 1992 model year by the ES300.\n\nYou should understand that the ES300 and `92 Camry are built off the same platform and share engines and transmissions, but Toyota promises the Camry will look noticeably different.\n\nThe ES250 and Camry for 1991 were such good cars, the fuss over who begot whom is, well, misbegotten.\n\nThe ES300 four-door luxury sedan differs from the ES250 it replaces on two major fronts: It boasts a larger, more powerful 3-liter, 185-horspower, 6- cylinder engine as standard rather than the ES250`s 156-h.p. 4, and it features styling that makes it look like a mini version of the $40,000 LS400 sedan.\n\nLexus, it seems, would much rather have the media confuse the $25,000 ES300 with the $40,000 LS400 than with the $15,000 Camry.\n\nYou`d rather have your kid mistaken for Princess Di than Prince Charles, too, unless your kid`s first name is Ralph.\n\nActually there`s one more difference of note. The ES250 started at about $22,000, the ES300 starts at $25,250 with 5-speed manual, $26,150 with 4-speed automatic. Cosmetic surgery doesn`t come cheap.\n\nWe test drove the ES300 with 4-speed automatic.\n\nThe most visible change is the sheet metal. The ES250 was boxy, the ES300 is rounded and more angular and nearly a direct copy of the LS400 sedan.\n\n“We did that family heritage on purpose,“ said Illingworth. “We did ourhomework to make the ES300a Lexus.“\n\nThe ploy worked. While driving the ES300 around Detroit, a fellow motorist honked and gestured wildly for our attention while stopped at the light.\n\n“Is that the big Lexus? “he asked, wondering whether the vehicle in our hands was the $40,000 version.\n\nHad Illingworth been in the passenger seat, he would have beamed.\n\nFrom the entry-level ES300 running through the SC400 and SC300 coupes and LS400 sedan, the crew looks alike. It`s more than somewhat ironic that such styling similarity once made Cadillac and Oldsmobile the butt of jokes.\n\nThough theES300 is 3 inches wider at 70 inches, 5 inches longer at 187.8 inches and is built on a 1-inch longer wheelbase at 103.1 inches, the rounded sheet metal makes it appear smaller than the rectangularES250. A low, slanting front end also adds to the illusion.\n\nHowever, inside there`s more than ample room up front, good space in back if you don`t mind sn uggness for the knees, and a spacious trunk.\n\nControls are well positioned for easy sight and use. A nice touch was placement of the remote fuel filler door and trunk release buttons in the driver`s door under the handle and the hidden dual cupholders that spring from the dash when the cover door is pushed.\n\nThe 3-liter V-6 is lively, even with automatic. More important, it`s whisper quiet, so much so that some owners are sure to make the major faux paus of turning the ignition key after the engine is started. Makers of rebuilt starters surely will forgive the error.\n\nThe EPA mileage rating is 18 miles per gallon city/24 m.p.g. highway with automatic, 19/25 with manual.\n\nTo increase driving range, the fuel tank was enlarged to hold 18.5 gallons, 2.6 gallons more than the ES250.\n\nBy the way, a 4-cylinder will be standard in Camry, this V-6 an option.\n\nThe suspension offers a choice of two settings, normal and firm. Normal was our choic . It provided adequate road hugging without the stiffness from the firm dial setting.\n\nWhen the streets were wet, the ES300 held well to the pavement without wandering. When the roads were dry, there was almost no lean or sway in corners or turns. When the road ahead unexpectedly veered sharply left under a bridge and then just as abruptly to the right after the bridge, the car sat flat through the brisk maneuver performed at 65 miles per hour.\n\nThe suspension, 15-inch radial tires and speed-sensitive power steering contributed to vehicle control, though we have to admit that on the bridge course, we paid homage to a being who spends no time in the Toyota engineering labs.\n\nIn terms of safety, anti-lock brakes and driver`s side air bag are standard. The bag, luckily, didn`t have to be tested. ABS did. When a driver decided to make a sudden and unexpected U-turn ahead, the ABS kept the ES300 from autographing her car at driver`s door level.\n\nWhat we found odd is that the ABS performed as designed, but there was too much brake pedal play in normal stopping. We prefer a pedal with quick, firm response when called upon.\n\nBase price of the test car was $26,150. Standard equipment included power brakes and steering, ABS, driver`s air bag, fully independent suspension, gas pressurized shocks, 15-inch radials, tilt steering, power windows and door locks, cruise control, air conditioning, power seats, AM/FM stereo and remote door lock/unlock activated by pushing a button on the ignition key.\n\nOptions added were a remote six-disc compact disc player in the trunk at $900, heated front seats at $300, leather seats and trim for $1,200, power moonroof for $900, plus freight at $400. The sticker read $29,850.\n\n>> 1992 Lexus EX300\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches Length: 187.8 inches Engine: 3 liter, 24valve, 185 h.p. V-6. Transmission: 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic optional.
