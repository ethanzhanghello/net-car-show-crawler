      "expert_review": "A 2022 update gave the Lexus ES a long-awaited touchscreen along with improved safety features. For 2023, the brand’s bestselling sedan returns with a new multimedia system, redesigned center console and updated F Sport models. These changes come with a larger price tag for each of the three powertrain variants: the six-cylinder 350, four-cylinder 250 and 300h four-cylinder hybrid.\n\nRelated: 2022 Lexus ES 350 Review: Now More Reasons to Buy\n\nWhat’s New?\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 ES uses the latest version of the Lexus Interface multimedia system, featuring a higher resolution touchscreen and antiglare technology, as well as standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition to its welcomed touchscreen functionality, the system comes with an advanced voice assistant that makes voice controls more intuitive, says Lexus. Additionally, the ES is eligible for Lexus’ new 10-year trial period for the brand’s connected services plans.\n\nThe interior’s other updates include new trim options and a redesigned center console. Ash bamboo trim is added to previously available open-pore brown walnut and open-pore black options, and a new Macadamia interior color replaces Rich Cream. The center console also is updated with a new sunglass holder and cupholders, plus wireless charging.\n\nF Sport Selections\n\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nWhile the F Sport trim isn’t new to the ES, Lexus has expanded the options for 2023. Previously, all three powertrain variants offered an F Sport model with unique exterior and interior styling elements for a sportier look; however, only the 350 came with an available F Sport Dynamic Handling Package for performance-oriented distinctions. Now, Lexus has split up its F Sport offerings into two separate trims: F Sport Design and F Sport Handling.\n\nThe F Sport Design can be had with all powertrain options. Mainly an appearance package with some interior upgrades, the F Sport Design adds 19-inch gloss-black alloy wheels; a unique front bumper, grille surround and rear spoiler; and standard collision warning. Shoppers looking for sportier performance will find it in the F Sport Handling variant that replaces the Dynamic Handling Package. In addition to the visual elements of the F Sport Design, the F Sport Handling offers standard Sport Plus and Custom drive modes as well as an F Sport-tuned adaptive variable suspension. It can now be found on the 350 and 300h.\n\nIn addition to the exterior cues outlined above, F Sport models add interior upgrades like a premium Mark Levinson sound system, a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen, a head-up display, panoramic roof, and power open and close trunk with a kick sensor.\n\nPowertrain Trio\n\nThe three available powertrains for the ES carry over from 2022. The ES 250 is powered by a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive; the ES 350 gets a 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic that only comes with front-wheel drive; and the ES 300h pairs a four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a continuously variable automatic for a combined 215 hp and FWD exclusively.\n\nTech and Safety\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new multimedia system in the ES is accessed through a standard 8-inch touchscreen or an available 12.3-inch display. The Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 suite is once again standard and includes advanced driver-assist features like blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. In the 2022 update, the system received camera and radar enhancements, new Intersection Turning Assist and Emergency Steering Assist features plus improved adaptive cruise control.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2023 Lexus ES | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Lexus ES is on sale now.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a mid-size luxury sedan that coddles you with its quiet cabin and, when equipped with its available V-6, surprisingly quick acceleration. Motivating the base ES 250 is a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive; we think the optional 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the ES 350, however, is more in keeping with this sedan’s luxury image and overall refinement. Also offered is an ES 300h hybrid variant that delivers 215 hp and an EPA-estimated 44 mpg in combined city/highway driving. ES competitors include the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES gets available 18-inch wheels in a Vapor Chrome finish, along with a Technology Package that bundles previously available features.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nFaux leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nMoonroof\n10-speaker audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHead-up instrument display\nWireless device charging\n17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power trunk lid\nSurround-view parking camera\nAmbient lighting\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather upholstery\nInterior wood trim\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES family is a smart choice for luxury sedan shoppers who prioritize comfort and quality. While the standard four-cylinder engine keeps the price low (and comes standard with AWD), the available V-6 is simply the better choice. It offers seamless acceleration and operates in near silence. Cabin quality is another aspect of the ES range that deserves high praise; there are soft-touch surfaces and nicely damped controls everywhere you look (and touch). True, the ES is not a particularly sporty ride even in its optional F Sport trim, but its overall refinement, ample feature content and strong safety scores make the ES worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a mid-size luxury sedan that coddles you with its quiet cabin and, when equipped with its available V-6, surprisingly quick acceleration. Motivating the base ES 250 is a 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with all-wheel drive. The optional 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the ES 350, however, is more in keeping with this sedan’s luxury image and overall refinement. Also available is an ES 300h hybrid variant that delivers 215 hp and an EPA-estimated 44 mpg in combined city-highway driving. ES competitors include the Acura TLX, Audi A6, Cadillac CT5, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe ES is essentially carried over for 2025. The only change of note is a new limited-edition Black Line Special Edition Package for the ES 350 F Sport Handling trim. The package adds black mirror housings, lip spoiler and sills, as well as F Sport puddle lamps, a head-up display, a 12.3-inch touchscreen and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus ES Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nFaux leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nMoonroof\n10-speaker audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHead-up instrument display\nWireless device charging\n17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound stereo\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHands-free power trunk lid\nSurround-view parking camera\nAmbient lighting\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather upholstery\nInterior wood trim\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus ES?\n\nThe Lexus ES is a smart choice for luxury sedan shoppers who prioritize comfort and quality. While the standard four-cylinder engine keeps the price low (and comes standard with AWD), the available V-6 is simply the better choice. It offers seamless acceleration and operates in near silence. Cabin quality is another aspect of the ES range that deserves high praise; there are soft-touch surfaces and nicely damped controls everywhere you look (and touch). The ES is not, however, a particularly sporty ride, even in its optional F Sport trim. But its overall refinement, ample feature content and strong safety scores make the ES worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A new touchscreen for multimedia and vehicle controls makes the 2022 Lexus ES 350 a much better option than previous versions.\n\nVersus the competition: In a class of small, sporty luxury sedans, the ES 350 remains a comfy, quiet option best experienced in its non-F Sport versions.\n\nIncremental changes have kept the Lexus ES sedan fresh since its 2019 model-year redesign, including a four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive ES 250 in 2021. But the 2022 ES is the best version yet — and it didn’t take an entire redesign or even a significant refresh to get there; all it took was a touchscreen.\n\nRelated: Updated 2022 Lexus ES Addresses One of Its Greatest Misses\n\nFinally, a Touchscreen\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOver years and through generations of Lexus ES sedans, drivers primarily controlled the car’s multimedia and other features through a wonky touchpad controller or a polarizing joystick. I preferred the 2014-18 joystick over the more recent touchpad, but neither was great.\n\nThe redesigned 2022 Lexus NX SUV got a whole new touchscreen system, and while the 2022 ES has kept its touchpad controller, its best upgrade is a new touchscreen to replace the previous non-touch display. It gives the ES 250 and ES 350 the usability we expect from a new car, including the ability to use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as they’re intended: by touch. Apple CarPlay even stretches across the whole screen, which isn’t a given with the proliferation of large screens in cars these days. I tested a top Ultra Luxury trim of the ES 350, and its 12.3-inch touchscreen was high-resolution and high-quality, with the same crisp graphics it had before to go along with its new touchscreen functionality — prompting a big sigh of relief. (A smaller 8-inch touchscreen is standard.)\n\nIn transforming its display to a touchscreen, Lexus positioned the new unit 4.3 inches closer to the driver than was the outgoing non-touchscreen. It’s a noticeable shift that puts the screen right at arm’s length. The Lexus RX 350 SUV received a similar update for 2020, but the screen remained a bit too far away for easy reach. That’s not the case in the ES. It’s like the manual transmission gearshift on a Mazda MX-5 Miata: exactly where you want and expect it to be.\n\n2022 Lexus ES 350 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nA lowly touchscreen may not seem like much, but it’s done away with the ES’ biggest red flag: The touchpad that was the primary controller before the touchscreen was truly hard to use while driving, requiring more steps than simply touching a screen, and it was inconsistent in its movement and activation. If you did like the touchpad controller (and I say “you,” singular, because that’s how many fans of it I think there are out there), know that it’s sticking around for now. Areas that still need improvement are the backup camera and 360-degree camera system displays. For how high-quality the native graphics are, the 360-degree camera system display lacks clarity, and its images stretch unnaturally across the screen.\n\nWhat Else Changed?\n\nThe rest of the ES is relatively unchanged, with respectable size and interior quality for the money. You can read our thoughts on its interior space and quality in our original review of the redesigned ES, as well as our review of the new-for-2021 ES 250 F Sport. While the touchscreen is the most notable change for 2022, there are some other ones, including additional standard safety features thanks to the inclusion of Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 (replacing the 2.0 version), which adds blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert to the automaker’s suite of standard safety features. The new standard features were optional on base trims of the 2021 ES but standard on all others.\n\nOther additions to Lexus Safety System Plus 2.5 include camera and radar enhancements that open up some newly available functions, including Intersection Turning Assist. In certain situations, this feature can identify an oncoming car or pedestrian and apply precollision system warnings and intervention. The adaptive cruise control feature adds Curve Speed Reduction to slow the vehicle through tight curves, and the lane-centering function is said to have better course recognition than the past version. In my testing, however, the lane-centering system was inconsistent when it came to keeping the car in a single position in a lane, and it often held uncomfortably to the right side of the lane.\n\nThe brake pedal is larger, and the brake system’s master cylinder and brake booster have been updated for more linear brake pedal feel and response; the previous braking system didn’t bother me, but if it did you, it might be worth revisiting.\n\nOn the outside, every trim except the F Sport gets a newly styled front grille. The car I tested had a grille with additional horizontal slots versus the 2021 version, breaking up the former grille’s humpback whale vibes. Also, the ES 300h hybrid gains the F Sport treatment for the first time.\n\nES 350: The Best ES\n\nF Sport is a sleek, attractive package that gives the ES a healthy dose of aggressive looks, but  its ride harshness and unique suspension tuning — even with the optional adjustable-firmness shock absorbers — make any handling gains not worth the price of admission. With the sporty GS sedan no longer available, the ES F Sport does have a place — but its looks, ironically, will be the driving factor for buyers, not how it drives. The base-suspension ES 350 exudes classiness and composure in its ride at highway speeds, and it accelerates with refined smoothness from its silky 302-horsepower V-6; the F Sport degrades some of that smooth ride.\n\nWhen I reviewed a then-new 2021 ES 250 F Sport — a four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive ES — I was disappointed in its acceleration and the wheeziness of the four-cylinder. Driving this ES 350 a year later validated my belief that the ES 350 remains the ES to buy — unless you absolutely need all-wheel drive — especially considering it has exactly the same starting price as the ES 250: $41,875, including destination fee. That pricing parallels what’s available in Cars.com’s national inventory: The average ES 350 listing price was $47,373 in November 2021, while the average list price for the ES 250 was $46,807, though there were only 291 of those cars in our inventory versus 2,448 ES 350s (meaning you have a better chance of finding an ES 350 anyway).\n\nIt’s a shame the ES 350 remains front-wheel-drive only because its front wheels are easily overpowered by its punchy V-6 engine. It’s the V-6 that needs all-wheel drive to retain the ES’ acceleration and pleasing engine soundtrack. The traction control does a fine job slowing the car’s wheel speed, but it notably hampers acceleration because it often has to work overtime: With all traction assistance off, the ES 350 blazes its tires.\n\nGiven my complaints about the V-6’s limited traction, it may sound contradictory to say I prefer the ES 350 over the ES 250 AWD. Easy enough solution, right? Buy the 250 and its AWD. But most of the times you think you need AWD, you could likely get by with a set of dedicated winter tires, and when you’re not digging out of the snow, the V-6 is simply the more appropriate — and more enjoyable — engine for the ES.\n\nMore From Cars.com:  \n\nHere Are 5 Great Affordable Luxury Cars You Can Buy Right Now\nWhat’s New From Lexus for 2022?\nHere’s Every Car That Earned an IIHS Top Safety Award for 2021\n2021 Lexus ES Offers AWD, Smaller Engine and Black Line Special Edition\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Lexus ES 350?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Lexus ES gets all-wheel drive for the first time, though it might not be what you’d expect: Four-wheel traction is paired only with a noisy, modestly powered four-cylinder engine. \n\nVersus the competition: With disappearing competition, the ES remains one of the last large, affordable luxury cars on the market that isn’t hellbent on being sporty. \n\nThe 2019 redesign of the Lexus ES made it a more accomplished luxury car with a higher-quality interior and improved isolation from road and wind noise, but that wasn’t the end of the updates for the ES: For 2021, Lexus has added a gas-only four-cylinder model, called the ES 250, that brings all-wheel drive to the party for the first time. Strangely, it’s not really appropriate to call the four-cylinder a “base” engine, because the ES 250 with AWD has a starting price identical to the front-wheel-drive-only V-6 ES 350, at $41,025 (all prices include destination charges).  \n\nRelated: 2021 Lexus ES Offers AWD, Smaller Engine and Black Line Special Edition\n\nThe ES faithful will find this newest AWD, four-cylinder variant very different from what they’re used to, but the ES faithful may not be the market for the new version. Mid-size luxury sedans aren’t exactly a hot ticket right now, as luxury and non-luxury automakers alike have increasingly turned their focus to SUVs. The ES 250 may instead serve multiple consumers: buyers looking for SUV-like all-season capability in a familiar sedan package, and those looking for an alternative to the discontinued Lexus GS, which was previously Lexus’ sportier mid-size sedan. (The ES F Sport variant will be the best bet for these shoppers.)\n\nMaking the ES 250: Fewer Cylinders, More Drive Wheels\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nAll-wheel drive is new for 2021, but it’s only available with the also-new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 203 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. Strangely, the ES 350’s accomplished and refined 3.5-liter V-6, which often overpowers the front tires on that car, can only have front-wheel drive. The ES 250’s power is a bit underwhelming for a 3,780-pound sedan — a Toyota RAV4’s power-to-weight ratio is more favorable. In my experience, though, the Lexus’ eight-speed automatic transmission reacts more quickly while passing than in similar front-wheel-drive Toyota/Lexus applications, so the four-cylinder doesn’t feel underpowered. It’s not as rewarding an experience as you get from the base turbocharged four-cylinders in the BMW 3 Series or Audi A4, and the ES 250’s grainy-sounding four-cylinder is unbecoming of the otherwise buttoned-up sedan. \n\nIn other cars, Toyota’s 2.5-liter is a commendable engine with surprising torque and linear power delivery, but it seems mismatched in the ES thanks to its rough soundtrack. Both during moderate acceleration and near redline, the engine wheezes through its powerband. That’s less of an issue in the non-luxury setting of parent-company Toyota’s cars and SUVs, where this engine more frequently appears, but it stands out in the Lexus. Competitors’ turbocharged four-cylinders don’t have to rev as high or as frequently, and turbos — driven by exhaust gases — act as an additional muffler to help hide ugly engine sounds. The Lexus is not turbocharged.\n\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe ES 250’s power and acceleration deficits are substantial compared with the ES 350, making 99 fewer horsepower and 83 fewer pounds-feet of torque (the V-6 is rated 302 hp and 267 pounds-feet of torque). Lexus says the ES 250 accelerates from 0-60 mph in 8.6 seconds, making it the slowest ES in the lineup. The ES 350 makes that run in 6.6 seconds, and even the ES 300h hybrid sprints to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds. The hybrid also uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, but it pairs with an electric motor for a combined 215 hp. Two seconds slower to 60 mph is a difference you feel in the seat of your pants. In addition to having the least power in the lineup, the ES 250 AWD is also the heaviest ES — by 90 pounds over the 350 and 50 pounds over the 300h.\n\nThe second attribute making the ES 250 unique is its new all-wheel-drive system, which can direct as much as 50 percent of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels for traction. I put the ES 250’s AWD to the test during a snowstorm that dumped 8 inches of snow overnight, burying the Lexus to its rocker panels in wet, heavy snow. The ES did its job clawing out of my uncleared driveway and unplowed neighborhood streets, all the way to a major street that had been plowed — and that’s really all this kind of system needs to do.\n\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nIt wasn’t flawless, though. The snow scraped the car’s underbelly thanks to its sedan ground clearance, and it hesitated briefly when accelerating from a stop as the all-season tires spun for grip. It was slowed by its traction control system, but the ES eventually gained steam without having to change drive modes or disable traction control for more wheel speed. \n\nThe ES 250’s all-wheel-drive system is a now-common type with front-to-rear torque transfer and the ability to decouple for increased fuel economy. It’s the same type you’ll find on the related Toyota Avalon and smaller Toyota Camry, but it’s really more similar to the AWD systems you’d find on small SUVs — not so much a performance-minded luxury sedan. The Acura TLX, for example, has a mechanical torque-vectoring rear axle for on-road dynamics, and the discontinued Buick LaCrosse was an odd host for impressive dynamics with its twin-clutch torque vectoring rear axle (RIP). The ES 250’s system does little, if anything, for on-road performance driving — but it isn’t much needed, considering that on dry roads the less-powerful four-cylinder mitigates the ES 350 V-6’s power-on-traction disadvantage anyway.\n\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOther than driveline, much of the ES 250 AWD is unchanged from the ES 350. The same is true of the 250 F Sport I drove, which uses the same wheels, tires and suspension tuning as the 350 F Sport, though the ES 350 F Sport is also available with an optional adjustable firmness suspension. The ES F Sport has a taut ride with more road feel than previous generations, but it’s not offensive or uncontrolled. It’s firm enough, however, that you’d best pass up the F Sport if you’re looking for the classic ES ride quality. The ES F Sport is essentially a proficient handling package, but it’s still not as eager to drive spiritedly as the outgoing rear-wheel-drive Lexus GS F Sport. That said, it also doesn’t crash over rough roads like other F Sport treatments (on the Lexus RC, for example), where large impacts shudder through the whole chassis. As a whole, the ES F Sport is quite livable.\n\nSame ES, for Better and Worse\n\nWhat hasn’t changed with the new engine and all-wheel-drive system is the ES’ generous occupant and cargo dimensions for the price, though it doesn’t have a folding backseat like the related Toyota Avalon. The ES is considerably larger and more comfortable than a BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 or Lexus IS. In fact, few remaining competitors match the ES’ price-to-size ratio. The Buick LaCrosse used to, but it’s gone now. The previous-generation Genesis G80 was close, until its pricing ballooned with its 2021 redesign.\n\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhat’s left? The Cadillac CT5 (formerly the CTS) is a compelling alternative that has some of the comfort vibe of the ES, but with more balanced ride and handling and without having to splurge for an additional performance suspension option. The last CT5 I tested had the optional 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with all-wheel drive, which Cadillac says goes from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds; as-tested, it stickered at $52,155. The ES 250 F Sport with AWD that I tested for this review cost $53,400, but it had a lot more advanced driver-assist tech than the CT5. The ES comes standard with full-speed adaptive cruise control and lane centering, and all trims except the base model have blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\n2021 Lexus ES 250 AWD | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nLittle else on the ES has changed since 2019, which means it has a commendably rich interior for its price; it showed off well in our test car’s red interior. I can’t say the same about the CT5. The ES, however, remains saddled with a touchpad-based multimedia and control system — no touchscreen. The available 12.3-inch screen is at least high resolution, and it includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s easy to view while driving, if hard to control. Lexus may be at a turning point, however, as the RX SUV received a well-done touchscreen for 2020 without a major redesign to the whole car, which means there’s hope yet that this major sticking point will be resolved with an update in the (near?) future.\n\nShould You Buy the ES 250 AWD or ES 350?\n\nIn the weirdest turn of the model year, the ES 250 and ES 350 have identical pricing, both starting at $41,025. Their standard features are nearly identical, but the ES 350 can be equipped with a panoramic glass roof and adaptive shocks, while the ES 250 can’t. As for gas mileage difference, it’s minor: The ES 350’s 22/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined is only 2 mpg combined less than the ES 250’s 25/34/28 mpg. Both cars make their maximum power on regular octane — not premium, like most luxury cars — so between the two powertrains you’re looking at an estimated gas price difference of only $100 per year, based on 15,000 miles a year at current fuel prices: $1,350 for the ES 250 and $1,450 for the ES 350. So, if fuel economy and price aren’t much of a consideration, what is? Honestly, it’s whether you need AWD.\n\nIf you have good snow removal — or little snow — and flat ground, a FWD ES 350 with good tires (all-seasons rated well in snow or dedicated winter tires) will most often be fine. All-wheel drive is most useful in deep snow or on roads/driveways with inclines. If you don’t need AWD, there’s little reason to consider the four-cylinder ES, given it’s not less expensive, it’s considerably pokier and louder, and its AWD doesn’t make the ES a more engaging sports sedan on dry roads. What it does do, however, is make the ES more appealing to a crowd that would otherwise be looking at an SUV. There’s comfort knowing you’ll be ready for just about any weather condition, and the ES 250 starts a full $5,000 less than a comparably sized mid-size Lexus RX SUV. \n\nAs for its qualifications as a GS 350 replacement, the AWD ES 250 is pretty far off. There’s no hope on the horizon for GS loyalists, either, as a Lexus spokesperson says there are no plans to add AWD to the ES 350 in the near future.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
