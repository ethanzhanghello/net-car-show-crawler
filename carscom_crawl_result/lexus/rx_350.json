      "expert_review": "My friend (and next-door neighbor) Jane has a 2000 Lexus RX 300. She has two very tall sons, 12-year old Sean is about 5′ 9″, and 16-year old Kyle is 6′ 4″. Jane, her sons, and her husband (who is also 6′ 4″) fit comfortably in the RX. They even like to take it on a couple of camping and road trips each year. Jane mentions that they did not want to buy a full size SUV for just a few trips a year and aside from the fact that they have to use a rooftop cargo carrier (affectionately known as “the turd”), they really like the car. The turd and a set of rotten cup holders are cited as the reasons they merely like their car, not love it. Now, I’m not one to completely dismiss a vehicle based on its cup holders but the one in Jane’s RX are flimsy and infuriating. If I’m going to spend that kind of money, I’d like to know that RX wouldn’t be improved with a purchase of those cup holders from Auto Zone that fit in the slot between the window and door. Anyway, that was the first thing Jane inspected, saying that she would not get a new RX unless this fatal design flaw had been fixed.\n\nRest assured the 2007 RX350 has stunning cup holders. Jane was actually plotting and scheming how to get hers replaced with the ones that come in the 2007 model. There are lots of them too (seven). They are all covered by lovely, wood-grain doors that camouflage them when they are not in use. See if you can find them in the picture! Other happy features include heated seats, and armrests built in to the front seats. I really dig the fact that I’m not resting my arm on the center console; it makes me feel like the car fits me that much better. There is a bit of space in front of the console below the gearshift to store a small to medium-sized purse, a feature that always wins a thumbs-up from me.\n\nI love the fact that the RX will grow with your family. Infants, toddlers and youngsters in car seats fit wonderfully in the RX350, and the kids can climb in easily by themselves. Well, not the infants, obviously. As Jane knows, teenagers fit very nicely too. I like that this car doesn’t feel like a family truckster but performs like one, handling various errands and tight parking spaces with ease and grace. My husband can hang out in the RX350 and not feel like he’s in a mom car or chick car. No evading errands for him if we owned one!\n\nIf I owned one, I might just pick the same color paint as the one on my test car. The dark grey-green is gorgeous. Hey, speaking of green, the RX350 comes in a hybrid version, the Lexus RX450h. That’s a family friendly feature I’m on board with too! Luxury and hybrid? What’s not to love? That’s a different review for a different time.\n\nIn any case, the RX350 leaves no stone unturned with its appointments. Leather, sunroof, and a DVD system that’s easy to use are just the beginning. I love the quiet ride and the good acceleration as well as the air suspension that has four different settings. I can set it on “Access” to ease getting in, or low, medium or high depending on my needs. Nice. And, of course, one of my all-time favorites, a power rear door. It comes standard on the RX350! Yay! Car seats are a cinch to install, and there is plenty of room for strollers in the cargo area.\n\nThe crazy feature that takes a little getting used to is the Adaptive Front Lighting System. When I turn the steering wheel to the left, the left headlight turns to the left and the right one stays pointing forward. Turning to the right (obviously), the right headlamp turns to the right and the left one stays forward. The road in front of me is more illuminated this way. The eerie sensation that I’m driving with eyeballs instead of headlights fades quickly as I grow to love it. It adds a human touch to the vehicle.\n\nWith all the love in the RX350, it’s still a family car for smaller families. As seen in Jane’s case, it needs a little help for larger journeys. It is a flexible car, handling almost anything and doing it well. I really enjoy my time in the RX, Grande Mocha included in its beautiful cup holder.\n\n*For more information on the 2007 Lexus RX350 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "The funny-looking Toyota concept Sport Luxury Vehicle bowed at the 1997 Chicago Auto Show as an alternative to the station wagon and minivan.\n\nWhen visitors, who vote with purses and wallets, gave it a big thumbs up, it was approved for production and renamed RX300 for sale in March 1998.\n\nIt quickly became the best-selling vehicle for Toyota’s Lexus division and a segment that has been growing in leaps and bounds.\n\nThe newest rendition, the 2010 RX350, is available in front-wheel drive for warm climes and all-wheel drive for the Snow Belt, with the hybrid RX450h due this summer.\n\nWe tested the AWD version. It packs a 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 teamed with a 6-speed automatic, an upgrade from a 3.5-liter, 270-h.p. V-6 with 5-speed automatic. Though it has a little more muscle, the V-6 gets better mileage as well, 18 m.p.g. city/24 highway with AWD, up from 17/22. Not bad, considering the security of AWD and capacity for five people and luggage, with neither stacked horizontally.\n\nOn a trip to Michigan and back along Interstate Highway 94, the RX never lacked for energy when passing or merging. And it cruised comfortably and quietly at 80 m.p.h., the local idling speed. Only time the RX had to back down is when conservation police in their sedans napped in the passing lane.\n\nThe RX has proved most popular among women, who make up the majority of drivers. So while energetic, its ride also is smooth and jostle-free. No tossing folks around the cabin.\n\nSince women are the primary drivers, and kids the most frequent passengers, Lexus focuses on safety with stability and traction control. Combined with AWD, the RX350 is nearly bulletproof in keeping the wheels down. Just in case, anti-lock brakes and side-curtain air bags with rollover sensors are standard too.\n\nAs part of a $2,000 comfort package, the test vehicle added adaptive front lighting in which the headlamps turn in the same direction as the front end. The comfort package includes rain-sensing wipers that start up when the drops fall down, intelligent high-beam headlamps that use sensors in the sideview mirrors to revert to low beams when a car approaches, and heated, ventilated seats.\n\nA pre-collision cruise-control option uses radar to keep a safe distance from vehicles ahead, though it wasn’t on the test car. Instead, it had a $4,980 package, with voice-command navigation, a rear-seat entertainment system with screens in the front-seat headrests and a backup camera that gives you a look in the navi screen at what’s behind.\n\nThere also are nozzles to clean headlamps and a power hatchlid as part of a $4,800 luxury package, and remote start ($175) to warm or cool the car before you get in. Keyless entry with push-button start is a novelty-a no-cost option.\n\nLexus improved the voice command of its navi system, which also includes audio and climate controls. Rather than the old stilted way of talking-“phone Bob” or “radio on” or “air conditioning on” or “restaurant, Japanese”-you can be conversational-“call Bob at home” or “make it cooler” or “let’s find XM Channel 150” or “Gimme a Japanese restaurant.” Still waiting for “Hey, dude, text my ‘American Idol’ vote.”\n\nNice touches include tool and first-aid kits, though both are in the cargo hold, so it’s not handy if a bandage is needed. There’s room for a purse under the center console, and illuminated cupholders to help spot the coffee at night to avoid having to pull over and reach into the cargo hold for first-aid kit to treat any burns.\n\nOther nice touches include a shade to hide packages in the cargo hold, pull handles to release rear-seat backs and a small stowage space under the cargo floor.\n\nUnlike BMW and its complex iCommand, the Lexus gizmo is a mouselike control in the center console to call up such things as radio and climate settings on the info screen. To turn on the radio, for example, you press the menu button, slide the arrow on the navi screen to the radio icon, then reach back and press Enter on the side of the mouse.\n\nOr, you touch the radio button on the instrument panel and the radio turns on to the dismay of the techno-wizards.\n\nThe RX350 with AWD starts at $38,200, with all power goodies standard. The front-wheel-drive version is $36,800. Opt for the adaptive lighting, power moonroof and navi system with magical mouse, and add just under $12,000 to the sticker.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLexus’ popular five-seat RX crossover shares a lot of components with the Toyota Venza crossover. All-wheel drive is optional. Rivals include the Acura MDX, Buick Enclave and Lincoln MKX.\n\nThe RX comes as a gas-powered RX 350 or gas-electric hybrid RX 450h. The latter model is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe RX 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine is now rated for regular gas, and a new Appearance Package features 19-inch seven-spoke wheels and darker headlight housings.\n\nExterior\nThe RX 350 has a downright wagonlike stance. In back are frosted taillight effects. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 19-inch wheels\nWater-repellant front door glass\nAutomatic on/off headlights\n\n\nInterior\nThe RX’s interior has swooping panels and futuristic controls. Chief among them is Lexus’ Remote Touch system, which uses a knob to navigate menus with a mouselike cursor on the dashboard screen. Other features include voice-recognition software that Lexus says will pick up conversational prompts rather than formal, specific commands.\n\nHigh-tech options include a head-up display with LED lighting that’s purportedly bright enough to read even on a sunny day. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth seats are standard; leather is optional\nReal wood interior trim\n10-way power front seats\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 275-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is standard; it works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Maximum towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, a rating the MKX can match and the MDX and Enclave can beat. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard front-wheel drive\nOptional all-wheel drive\nAutomatic transmission features clutchless-manual mode\n\n\nSafety\nTen standard airbags include four in front — the two required chest airbags plus two knee airbags — as well as seat-mounted side-impact airbags for both rows of seats. Head-protecting side curtain airbags cover both rows, too.\n\nLexus’ Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management system, which better integrates the electronic stability system with various other systems, is optional. So is a radar-based Pre-Collision System that can cinch the seat belts and prime the brakes for maximum response should it detect an imminent impact. An optional side-mirror-mounted camera system gives drivers a wide view of the adjacent lane. Additional standard safety features include:\n\n\nActive front head restraints\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "It might be hard to believe, but luxury crossovers and decent gas mileage aren’t mutually exclusive. Just take a look at Lexus’ popular RX 350. Now going on its 11th model year, the RX is one of the most fuel-efficient crossovers available today; the front-wheel-drive model is rated at 18/23 mpg city/highway. That’s not far behind some V-6-powered midsize sedans, including the Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion.\n\nLuxury Crossover Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)*\n\t2WD\t4WD\n2008 Infiniti EX35\t17/24\t16/23\n2009 Lexus RX 350\t18/23\t17/22\n2008 Lincoln MKX\t16/24\t15/22\n2009 Cadillac SRX V-6\t15/23\t14/22\n2008 Acura MDX\t—\t15/20\n*Sorted by highway gas mileage estimates for 4WD models.\n\nIt takes a lot more than decent gas mileage to make a luxury crossover, though, and the RX 350 delivers on most fronts, even in the face of newer competitors like the Acura MDX and Infiniti EX35. However, it does have its share of quirks on the inside.\n\nStyling\nOne thing that’s helped the RX 350 age well is its exterior styling, which even today looks fresh and modern. The crossover features sleek styling, whether you’re looking at the front or the back, with its angled grille and forward-swept D-pillars. Cargo room suffers a little from this kind of styling, but from the outside the RX 350 brings a distinctive look to the luxury segment.\n\nOne change for the 2009 model year is the newly available Pebble Beach Edition for the RX 350. My test model was equipped with this package, which costs $3,880 and features unique styling cues, including a restyled grille that’s quite different from the one regular RX 350s wear, special 18-inch alloy wheels, special badges and an exclusive paint color: Truffle Mica. The changes definitely spiff up the crossover, though it’s still unmistakably an RX (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nRide & Handling\nThe RX 350 is one of the better examples of the crossover ideal: the blending of SUV styling with carlike ride comfort. If you didn’t know any better, you might think you were in one of Lexus’ passenger cars when driving the RX; the comfortable ride, smooth steering response and general refinement are all there. You do sit higher than in a passenger car — which is part of the appeal of crossovers like this — but not so high that you have to climb up into the driver’s seat like you do in some large SUVs. A height-adjustable air suspension is optional.\n\nThe driving experience doesn’t change markedly at highway speeds, where the RX 350 remains a comfortable cruiser. Another nice plus — and one that’s common in Lexus models — is that the cabin is quiet.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe RX 350 has a refined powertrain to go along with its refined ride quality. The standard 270-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 provides strong acceleration that’s accompanied by a muted growl, and the five-speed automatic transmission makes quick kickdowns when called upon. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are offered.\n\nStopping is just as important as accelerating, if not more so. The RX 350 is fitted with disc brakes at all four corners, and they do a good job. This sure-footed stopping power is accompanied by a progressive brake pedal that offers good brake feel, which aids driver confidence.\n\nThe Inside\nAs with its exterior, the RX 350’s cabin has aged remarkably well when you consider that this generation was first offered for the 2004 model year, as the RX 330. It’s especially noteworthy, in light of the attention automakers are giving to interior quality these days, to see an interior at the end of its lifecycle that’s still competitive with those of brand-new luxury crossovers. I do have my share of quibbles with the cabin’s design, however, and they concern the center control panel.\n\nFirst of all, I’m not a fan of silver-colored buttons in whatever kind of vehicle they rear their heads, and they’re all over the place in the RX 350. That said, one button I wish were present — even in silver — is one for the air conditioning fan. Rather than having a button on the dashboard, models with the optional navigation system, like the one I tested, make you call up the climate settings on the touch-screen to change the fan speed.\n\nLexus lets you choose whether the navigation system’s screen should default to the map or stay on another menu you’ve selected, like the one for the audio presets, while driving. It’s nice to have this choice, but whenever you put the gear selector in Reverse — activating the backup camera — and then shift back to Drive, the screen returns to the map regardless of whether you want it to. Small stuff, for sure, but annoying nonetheless.\n\nThose things aside, cabin highlights include comfortable front bucket seats with armrests attached to the inner side of each backrest. Leather seats are optional, which is a little surprising seeing that a number of the RX 350’s competitors get standard leather seats.\n\nThe three-place rear bench seat is pretty spacious for adults. The backseat’s two sections slide forward and backward, which is handy if you happen to have a child-safety seat attached to one of them and want to bring it closer to the front seats so it’s easier to reach. This also lets you give more room to either the passengers or the cargo area, whichever you need.\n\nThe backseat also reclines, and while I appreciate this feature, I don’t like where Lexus placed the lever: It’s positioned on the upper-outside corner of the backrest, and if you want to recline the backrest while sitting there you have to twist around to lift it. The same goes for trying to bring the seat back up. A better location for this lever — and one that Audi’s chosen for the reclining second row in its Q7 SUV — would’ve been somewhere on the outside edge of the seat cushion, where it’d be easy to reach.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe RX 350 offers 38.3 cubic feet of cargo room, and it also includes three underfloor storage compartments for valuables you’d rather keep out of sight. The flipside of this feature is that it relegates the spare tire to a spot underneath the crossover rather than under the cargo floor, which means it’s both exposed to the elements and harder to reach.\n\nFolding the split backseat is simple — just lift the same handle used to recline the seats, then fold the backrest forward. When folded, the backrests are nearly level with the cargo floor, which makes for an unobstructed extended load floor and 84.7 cubic feet of total cargo room.\n\nThe base RX 350 is rated to tow up to 2,000 pounds. When equipped with the optional Towing Prep package, which includes a heavy-duty radiator and transmission cooler, the maximum towing capacity increases to 3,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nThe RX 350 has standard antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset crash test, the RX received an overall score of Good, which is the best possible rating. IIHS hasn’t subjected the RX to its side-impact test.\n\nRX 350 in the Market\nEven though Lexus won’t say whether a redesigned RX is on the way, it’s highly likely there’s one right around the corner — possibly even for the 2010 model year. Having been around for six model years since its last redesign, the current RX is at that age when Lexus likes to revamp its popular models. While its eventual successor will undoubtedly have improvements, you won’t go wrong with this generation of the RX.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "After a week test-driving the 2011 Lexus RX 350, a headline in the Wall Street Journal’s April 18, 2011, edition caught my eye: “Lexus Falls Behind Rivals.” The timing of this article was fortuitous because I’d been grappling with the fact that I really didn’t love the RX 350 during my test drive. I was eager to drive it since I’ve seen so many of them around town and assumed there must be something extraordinary about this car since it’s such a hot commodity. As it turned out, the RX 350 is extraordinary in how ordinary it is.\n\nThe RX 350 is the blue blood of luxury crossovers; it’s well-appointed but sometimes it’s just too reserved to elicit any excitement and pales in comparison to some of its rivals.\n\nAcceleration, braking and everything in between was smooth. So smooth in fact that I barely even noticed any of it. However, I’d still recommend this car; it’s comfortable, user-friendly in its simplicity and roomy enough for a family of four. However, if you want a car with a third row, an exciting driving experience and lots of high-tech standard features, this isn’t it. The RX 350’s competition — the Acura MDX, Cadillac SRX or BMW X3 or X5 — offers plenty of those things, though. The RX 350 is a crossover your mom would adore, but your younger brother would find totally dull, so make sure you know who you’re shopping for (even if it’s yourself) before you buy.\n\nBesides a few new exterior colors and a new brake override system that is now standard across the line, the RX 350 doesn’t have many new features for 2011. The 2011 Lexus RX 350 with all-wheel drive that I tested had a price tag of $51,234, though the base trim’s starting MSRP is $39,075.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2011 RX 350 says luxury without being ostentatious and offers soft lines and curves that create a perfectly well-rounded facade. From the outside, it’s easy to see why so many people drive this five-passenger crossover.\n\nMy test car had the optional 19-inch alloy wheels, folding heated side mirrors and headlamp cleaners. The retractable mirrors came in handy when I parked the RX in a crowded city lot on a busy Friday night. The parking spaces were tight, yet we had no problem getting in and out of it and no fear that anyone would skim the mirrors when walking by or pulling in next to us.\n\nThe featherweight doors and liftgate are great. They’re not flimsy; they’re lightweight and easy for me and my children to maneuver. With a car this easy to get in and out of with the kids, I might someday experience a life without neck and shoulder pain since the usual lifting of kids was kept to a minimum.\n\nThe power liftgate also made life easier. The rear cargo space was large enough and offered a cargo cover, net and under-floor compartment. There really was a place for everything.\n\nGiven my depiction of the Lexus as the blue blood of luxury cars, it was befitting that my test car came in a color called Satin Cashmere Metallic. Nothing says luxury like cashmere, and my test car’s color spiced things up a bit.\n\nThe 2011 RX 350’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine delivers 275 horsepower and uses premium fuel. The front-wheel-drive RX gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway, and my all-wheel-drive test car gets 18/24 mpg. I split my time with the RX almost evenly between the city streets and the highway and ended up averaging upward of 22 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe interior of the RX 350 is surprisingly understated and simple. The wood trim looks nice, but the black- and silver-colored plastic surfaces could have appeared more upscale.\n\nAfter testing a few cars whose center stacks resembled those of airplane cockpits, the simplicity of the RX 350’s center stack was unique. While some have complained about the joystick-operated multimedia system, I found it intuitive and easy to use. That’s not to say it was the fastest or most efficient system — at times searching for a song on my iPod was like using an antiquated PC mouse to scroll through a document — but overall, it got passing marks.\n\nEverything else was easy to find and use, as well. The SmartAccess passive entry system anticipated my approach and unlocked the RX for me. Delightful. The RX also offers the opportunity to be organized. The center console, glove box, rear pull-down armrest and side pockets in the front doors all had a variety of tiers, shelving or convenient compartments. Another bonus was the extra cupholder to the left of the steering wheel. This enabled me to keep my water in the center-console cupholder and my tea in the extra one.\n\nMost of the luxury features on this car came as part of optional packages. It seems to me that some of these options — leather seats, heated seats, USB input — would be standard on a luxury car. The $4,900 Luxury Package added the leather seats and leather-and-wood steering wheel, one-touch moonroof, USB input, power liftgate, driver’s seat and steering-wheel memory, and passenger-side-mirror-mounted wide-view camera. For a few more thousand dollars, the interior was spruced up with heated and ventilated front seats, a Mark Levinson stereo and navigation system with voice activation, and a backup camera.\n\nWith or without the optional packages, road noise in the RX 350 is quite high. It was loud enough to hinder conversations my children tried to have with me and caused them to yell. Between the yelling toddlers and the road noise, it was never exactly a peaceful ride inside the cabin.\n\nThe good news, in this case, is only two of my children fit in the RX 350 at a time, so I never had all three of them screaming at me at once. Additionally, should you ever decide to leave the kids at home and bring a few adults along for a ride, three can fit in that second row. The person on the middle “hump” won’t even complain about being crowded.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Lexus RX 350 received a Top Safety Pick award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, roof-strength and rear crash tests. It also has a standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe RX 350 is loaded with standard safety features such as front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, active head restraints in the front row and nine airbags, including side curtains and side-impact airbags for both rows. Also of note is the standard mini tool kit and first-aid kit in the rear of the car. I’m a sucker for little extras like this and think of them as tantamount to the warm cookies and Champagne that you get when you fly first class. They’re small things that make a big difference.\n\nThe RX’s optional safety features included all-wheel drive, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, a head-up display, backup camera, front and rear parking sensors and wide-view camera.\n\nThe only safety downfall in the 2011 RX 350 came in the form of the two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. I had to excavate them from the seats. This left me disgruntled and in need of a manicure. It’s a pain to have to struggle to get your car seats installed. It should be easier, but it rarely is.\n\nThere was room enough for an infant seat, a convertible and a booster (just barely) across the second row, but since none of my children are in a booster yet, this configuration was lost on me. However, with just an infant seat and a convertible installed, or even two convertibles, the RX 350 offered plenty of legroom for the kids and the front driver and front passenger.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Lexus RX 350 here.",

      "expert_review": "One of life’s sinking feelings comes from waking up just before sunup, looking outside and seeing that you left an interior light on in the car all night long. In the old days, that scenario guaranteed a dead battery.\n\nI had that feeling recently, at 5:30 a.m. on a cold Sunday. I saw the dome light shining inside today’s test car, a 2008 Lexus RX 350. It was both a beacon to tell the neighbors I was a nitwit and a signal that I wasn’t going back to sleep, not while wondering whether the battery still had enough juice left to start the engine.\n\nThe night before, I managed to synch my cellphone with the Lexus Bluetooth system and also programmed a few numbers into the car’s memory. But I forgot to turn the dome light off. So in the predawn, I padded outside in sweats.\n\nOpening the Lexus door at night is a revelation. Beside the dome lights, there is classy lighting everywhere, including puddle lamps under the outside mirrors that turn on when the doors are unlocked.\n\nInside, there are the footlights in the leg wells, a lighted Lexus nameplate in the doorsill, lighted cupholders, lighted front console, and lighted glove box. It’s an immediate example of how to equate lighting with luxury.\n\nDespite all the bulbs, including the dim one in the driver’s seat, our Lexus fired up right away. And what better time to go for a joy-ride than at 6 a.m. on a winter Sunday, even if it’s under the pretext of recharging the battery?\n\nTime and sales have proven that Lexus got the formula right when it introduced the RX 300, as it was first called, in 1998. That gave the company an early leadership in the midsize luxury segment and it added to that refinement as the vehicle became the RX 330 in 2003, and eventually the RX 350 when it went to the present 3.5-liter engine in 2006.\n\nBoth the front and rear lights of the RX 350 are molded into the body as a part of the styling with LED tail lights adding another subtle signal of luxury. Up front, the adaptive headlights turn with the vehicle and also adjust height automatically to maximize forward visibility without distracting oncoming drivers. These headlights can make a dramatic difference in the nighttime driving experience, especially when you’re switching from an older car with sandblasted (from road debris) headlight covers.\n\nThe keywords that come to mind in describing the RX 350 are luxury, safety, comfort, refinement, and reliability.\n\nPerformance is more than adequate, but the Lexus doesn’t have to corner as if it’s on rails, boast about its tuned exhaust, or have great appeal to the tuner market. Nor has it squeezed a third-row seat in back, though that may be an option when the third generation vehicle comes along in a year or two.\n\nMeanwhile, the RX 350 remains a benchmark for the segment with a smooth V6 that’s plenty powerful for the car-based architecture, delivers roughly 20 miles per gallon, and gets you there in as much comfort as you should ever desire. Buyers seeking a greener version can opt for the 400h hybrid version.\n\nOur test vehicle had more than 19,000 miles on it, but other than some winter dirt on the front carpets there were no rattles or signs of wear.\n\nIt had a base price of $38,800. Our two favorite options were the $665 package that added multistage heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, headlight washers, and a $160 towing prep package that added a transmission cooler, heavy-duty alternator, and radiator.\n\nMore pricey were the Generation 5 Nav system with Bluetooth, voice-activation, and rear back-up camera ($2,650) and the luxury value package ($2,060) which added leather interior trim, power tilt/telescoping wheel with memory, high-discharge and adaptive headlights, illuminated entry, and one-touch moonroof.\n\nBut sometimes what you appreciate most is the fact it will start at the turn of the key – even if you leave the reading light on all night.\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nBase price/as tested $38,800 / $47,395 Fuel economy 20.3 miles per gallon in Globe testing\n\nTHE EARLY LINE\n\nIn this case, the early line is actually a late line. The RX 350 is nearing the end of its second generation, but remains relevant and competitive in the midsize luxury SUV segment.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\n\nDrivetrain 3.5-liter V6, 5-speed automatic transmission and full-time all-wheel drive\n\nSeating 5 passengers\n\nHorsepower 270\n\nTorque 251 lb.-ft.\n\nOverall length 186.2 inches\n\nWheelbase 106.9 inches\n\nHeight 66.1 inches\n\nWidth 72.6 inches\n\nCurb weight 4,090 pounds\n\nTHE SKINNY\n\nNice touch The user-friendly Bluetooth and navigation system.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nThe mirror adjustments, rear gate, and fuel door release all are located low on the left side of the instrument panel, out of sight for a taller driver.\n\nWatch for The RX 350’s cousin, the Toyota Highlander, has been reintroduced, so look for a third-generation RX in a year or two.\n\nConsider shopping it against Acura MDX, Cadillac SRX, Infiniti Fx35, Land Rover LR3, Nissan Murano, Volvo XC90.",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus RX 350 was arguably the first luxury crossover on the market. I don’t know about you, but I tend to overlook it: It’s been around forever (since 1998), it hasn’t made any Extreme Makeover-like changes to capture my attention, and it’s driven by seemingly every high-income suburban mom in the carpool lane.\n\nHowever, there’s a reason why so many of them are on the road, and that’s what I had forgotten before driving the 2013 model refreshed my memory.\n\nWith the exception of a few gripes, the 2013 Lexus RX 350 is an absolute pleasure to get into every morning, comforting me in my hectic family routine and offering me support around every corner.\n\nThere are a few updates to the 2013 Lexus RX, most notably a new front-end design. Compare the 2012 and 2013 versions here. The base 2013 model comes with either front- or all-wheel drive. A new F Sport version includes an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, dynamic handling with sport suspension, and a more aggressive-looking grille and front bumper. See the three trim levels compared side by side here. My test car was a base, AWD version equipped with the Comfort Package, Luxury Package, Navigation Package and Intuitive Parking Assist system.\n\nThe Lexus RX competes directly with five-seaters like the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX; see them compared here. If you need more seating for your family, you may want to look into the Acura MDX and Infiniti JX35, which have three rows of seats. See the three models compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen the RX first hit the market, it was incredibly progressive with its sleek, rounded lines and low-profile design. Today, that’s the general look that nearly every crossover on the market has emulated. While Lexus should be proud of setting the tone (it’s the highest form of flattery, right?), the downside is that every year the RX slips just a bit further into design obscurity while the rest of the market continues to evolve.\n\nThe step-in height of the RX is just a smidgen high for me to slide into the seat without effort. At 5 feet 3 inches, I need to reach up just a bit on my tippytoes to get in easily, which is great news for the rest of the average-height population. Sliding in and out is assisted by a power seat and steering wheel that automatically adjust to create more space. Keyless entry and start and a power-operated liftgate also make life easier.\n\nMy kids (ages 8, 10 and 12) had no trouble hopping in and out of the RX unassisted.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe RX’s interior is a mix of thoughtful refinement and an apparent attempt to keep its age at bay (like my mom trying to look like a hipster at Starbucks with her MacBook Air, even though she’s still a little unclear about the difference between the internet and email). It initially felt upscale and luxurious, but my discriminating husband couldn’t stop griping about the abundance of “cheap-looking” plastic trim on the steering-wheel and radio surrounds and the trim above the glove box. Honestly, I may not have noticed it if it weren’t for him pointing it out, but once he did I had a hard time ignoring it. There were a few areas with the new high-end-looking black bird’s-eye maple wood trim in my test car, but this should have been carried throughout the cabin.\n\nNote that the RX 350’s standard seats have cloth upholstery. Leather seats come standard on the RDX, Q5, MDX, JX35 and several other competitors.\n\nLexus’ supposedly forward-thinking Enform communications center went mostly unused during my test drive. I wasn’t a fan of the mouse-like joystick used to control the screen. (I’d really just prefer a touch-screen, though neat freaks will appreciate not having to obsessively wipe fingerprints off the screen.) While Toyota’s Enform can pair with your smartphone to offer access to apps such as Bing, OpenTable, iHeartRadio and MovieTickets.com through your vehicle’s interface, quite frankly, I’d rather just stick to the familiar interface of my iPhone if I need to make dinner reservations or buy movie tickets on the fly (of course, not while actually driving). I prefer Google to Bing for web and map searches, Urbanspoon to Yelp for restaurant reviews, and Flixster to MovieTickets.com for movie times and tickets. In short, I don’t want my car telling me which apps to use.\n\nIt seems I’m not the only one disenchanted with Enform. User reviews of the accompanying iPhone app range from calling it a “gimmick that doesn’t work” to others who can’t even log in to the system from their phones, instead getting a “permanent rather than intermittent error message.” Yikes. Seems Lexus needs to call a do-over on this one.\n\nThe Connect portion of Enform offers safety services such as roadside assistance, stolen-car recovery and airbag deployment notification. They seem antiquated compared with Hyundai’s Blue Link system, which allows you to preset curfew, geofence and maximum speed limits for the car, and sends you text and email notification alerts when the car goes outside those boundaries. Even GM’s OnStar system gives you access to a live operator to help you through just about anything.\n\nThere were plenty of storage compartments throughout the RX’s interior. I especially appreciated the extra-large pop-out bins in the front door panels. When closed, the low-profile design is unobtrusive, but when popped open they expand to hold water bottles, snacks and all the trash I tend to accumulate through the course of a week.\n\nThe two standard cupholders in the center console for the driver and front passenger have a cover to close them up, streamlining the look of the interior. This is a great feature if, like me, you tend to use your cupholders to store myriad small items (lip balm, tissues, etc.) and you want a quick and easy way to clean up your car. It’s a little like throwing all your stuff in a closet before guests arrive. A third cupholder for the driver pops out of the dash to the left of the steering wheel, just in front of the air vent. I loved having that extra place to store a cup, but since it was right in front of the air vent, stashing my hot latte there cooled my coffee down instead of me.\n\nAn additional small pass-through storage bin under the center console was a great place to stash a small evening bag, though it wasn’t large enough to store my daytime purse, which remained relegated to the passenger footwell.\n\nI really appreciate that the RX gives the driver and front passenger equal seat comfort and adjustability. Both sides feature standard eight-way power adjustment (including adjustable thigh support, which is awesome in our family, given my husband is nearly a foot taller than me). When we’re together as a family, I often ride as a passenger and I hate getting shafted out of the luxury of the driver’s seat. On cold mornings, however, I would definitely be fighting for the driver’s seat in the RX thanks to the heated steering wheel in my test car. Both the driver and passenger seat were heated and cooled, part of a $1,340 Comfort Package. A memory function on the driver’s seat is part of a $4,520 Luxury Package.\n\nMy three girls had more than enough backseat legroom for their legs and their obese backpacks — up to 36.8 inches of it thanks to a sliding rear seat. The seats also recline a bit, which is a huge bonus for my two youngest, who still like to nap in their high-back boosters. I could recline the seat just enough to take the edge off so they could sleep comfortably without slumping forward over their seat belts.\n\nThe kids had access to in-door bottle holders, storage pockets on the back of the front seats, and a center seatback that folded down to provide an armrest with cupholders in it.\n\nThe rear seats are split 40/20/40 and fold flat, expanding the cargo area from 40 cubic feet up to 80.3 cubic feet. These dimensions handily beat the other five-seat models mentioned. The RX’s volume is actually within a few cubic feet of the three-row models — both with their third rows folded and with both rows folded.\n\nYou can fold the Lexus RX 350’s seats from the seatback itself or from the cargo area, where you can pull a spring-mounted lever that makes the seats fold down.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDriving the 3.5-liter V-6, AWD Lexus RX350 was generally a pleasurable experience, given this isn’t a racecar and isn’t meant to be driven like one. I found its acceleration to be responsive for family-hauling, even while tootling up the hills in my high-altitude ‘hood getting to and from my children’s school. The suspension in the base model was soft enough for the car to be comfortably used as a daily driver. For those wanting a “sportier” ride, the F Sport and its sport tuning is a logical upgrade.\n\nCornering in the RX is about like you’d expect: not as roly-poly as a truck-based SUV, yet not as tight as smaller crossovers, like the Infiniti EX. Falling somewhere in the middle is sure to attract the middle-ground consumer who just wants an easy ride for daily driving chores.\n\nThe RX surprisingly takes regular gas, and with AWD it gets EPA-estimated fuel economy of 20 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The front-drive version gets an estimated 21 mpg combined. This performance is slightly below average among five-seaters and on the better side compared with larger crossovers. A hybrid version, the Lexus RX 450h, is rated 30 or 29 mpg combined with FWD or AWD, respectively.\n\nWhile the interior of the RX can be incredibly quiet, filtering out an immense amount of road and engine noise, the extra-large side mirrors create more wind noise than expected.\n\nSAFETY\nThe AWD 2013 Lexus RX 350 received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (four stars for frontal crash, five stars for side crash and four stars for rollover resistance). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet performed crash tests on the 2013 RX. As is required of all new cars since the 2012 model year, the RX 350 has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. The RX features 10 airbags, including driver and front passenger dual-stage twin chamber airbags, driver and front passenger knee airbags, front- and rear-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, and front and rear side curtain airbags.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the lower anchors of the Latch system are buried deep within the seat bight and are difficult to access. However, older kids in booster seats will appreciate the easy-to-use seat belt buckles in the two outboard rear seats. They’re on stable bases, making it easy for little hands with limited dexterity to buckle up on their own.\n\nWhile the RX seems to have just about every safety feature on the market today, the lack of a standard blind spot monitor was an annoyance in my test car. Given the super-large side mirrors, I kept hoping they’d have some additional function above and beyond just being a mirror. A blind spot monitoring system is optional. Front and rear parking sensors, pre-collision alert system and a rear backup camera are also options on the RX.\n\nSee all of the RX’s standard safety features here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Wild styling draws attention to the 2016 Lexus RX 350, but uninspired handling, lackluster brake feel and a lack of innovative features won’t win it many new friends.\n\nSince its introduction in 1998, the Lexus RX midsize luxury SUV has been a hit. It’s one of the few luxury vehicles of any type that regularly sells more than 100,000 units a year in the U.S. It’s been a boon for the Lexus brand. But Lexus has always played it safe with the Lexus RX, with styling that was warm but never hot and driving dynamics that were pleasing but never entertaining.\n\nThe new 2016 RX 350 and RX 450h hybrid are the latest attempts to inject some youthful exuberance into the Lexus lexicon, but with many changes that don’t go much more than skin-deep, has Lexus gone far enough to attract new buyers?\n\nExterior & Styling\nTo paraphrase style maven Tim Gunn, the 2016 Lexus RX has a whole lot of look. From the pointed, gaping, spindle-shaped grille up front to the hash work of character lines down the side and a floating roof element that is dangerously close to becoming the latest styling element that every automaker incorporates, the new RX is highly distinctive. And yet, it works.\n\nThis may be the first instance of Lexus’ dramatic new styling coming together cohesively in an appealing manner. The new RX looks modern and distinctive, and the proportions are well-suited to the look. It’s a little bit longer and marginally wider, mostly to give backseat passengers more legroom, but the RX looks good from any angle.\n\nLED headlights and taillights can be had, and even an upgraded premium tri-lens package light can be optioned, which features LED cornering lights and rear turn signals. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard, but 20-inch wheels are optional, an inch larger than the 2015 unit offered. They fill out the wheel wells nicely and add to the RX’s high-tech look.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe RX comes in four flavors: the base Lexus RX 350, the Lexus RX 350 F Sport, the Lexus RX 450h hybrid and new for 2016, a Lexus RX 450h F Sport. The base model’s 3.5-liter V-6 is basically unchanged from 2015 aside from a modest 25-horsepower bump. The eight-speed automatic that was only available on the 2015 Lexus RX 350 F Sport is now standard on the RX 350 too. The result is an acceptably quick SUV that delivers thrust in a smooth flow, with shifts that are unobtrusive and practically seamless.\n\nThe transmission does hunt a bit during spirited driving, but with eight speeds to play with, that’s to be expected. The result of that hunting is a vehicle that’s always ready with power when you need it; the powertrain, in fact, is the best part of the RX experience.\n\nIf you’d rather pay a little more money for better fuel economy, the RX 450h hybrid isn’t a bad way to do it, with just as much power on tap when you need it, but the added benefit of limited EV operation when you don’t. It makes a total of 308 system hp from a combination of the V-6 and electric motors. The hybrid still uses a heavy nickel-metal-hydride battery instead of a lighter, more power-dense lithium-ion one, but it’s been repackaged so it no longer intrudes into the cargo or rear passenger space.\n\nFrom a powertrain standpoint, there isn’t much of a downside to opting for the hybrid. Throttle response is delayed a bit as it passes through an initial EV mode before employing the gasoline engine, but the hybrid performs remarkably similarly to the gas-only model. It’s worlds better than the outgoing RX hybrid.\n\nThe rest of the RX 350 is less entertaining.\n\nIts steering is nicely balanced, but it feels slow to react. In normal driving through parking lots and interstate roads, it won’t be an issue, but when trying to negotiate switchbacks or mountain twisties, it becomes more apparent. The RX 350 is prone to understeer in both front- and all-wheel-drive versions, with pronounced body roll that makes the heavy SUV push through corners instead of slice neatly through them.\n\nIt is not nearly as athletic as a BMW X5 or Audi Q5, but its heft and damping give it a solidity and stability that is lacking from vehicles like the Cadillac SRX. The brakes are unimpressive, providing little feedback. Using them almost feels like you’ve pushed a “brakes button” instead of a pedal — they’re working, but it doesn’t feel like there’s much mechanical action happening underfoot; the RX’s mass once again is acutely felt.\n\nBoth the Lexus RX 350 and Lexus RX 450h can be had with an F Sport trim aimed at changing the driving experience to something more appealing to German-luxury buyers. The F Sport trim doesn’t get any more power; its mechanical changes are limited to firmer suspension tuning, a special transmission shift program and less power-steering assist, for better feedback. There are also some added appearance items inside and out.\n\nRequired steering effort goes up noticeably in F Sport versions. If you use the multimode selector dial to switch into Sport S or Sport S+ modes, it goes up even more dramatically. Transmission and accelerator responsiveness also get much more aggressive, and the adaptive suspension that’s unique to the F Sport stiffens the ride considerably. Unfortunately, none of this translates into a more capable vehicle. It’s still just as heavy as the base model and features significant understeer and body roll.\n\nIt may feel sportier, but the F Sport’s changes don’t improve the RX’s abilities. I would opt for a base RX 350 over the F Sport and its more heavily bolstered sport seats (which are too small, too firm and too rigidly bolstered) and less informative gauge package. The more affordable version is much more pleasant to drive, more comfortable and quieter to boot.\n\nFuel economy is above average for both RX models. The Lexus RX 350 is estimated to achieve 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 19/26/22 mpg with AWD. The 450h is a bit better, with an estimated 31/30/30 mpg in front-drive models and 30/28/30 mpg with AWD. Most of the benefit comes in city driving thanks to the gasoline-electric hybrid’s gas-saving low-speed EV mode.\n\nIn comparison, the Acura MDX gets nearly identical numbers, with 20/27/23 mpg and 19/26/22 mpg with front- and all-wheel drive, respectively. Cadillac’s SRX gets a much worse 17/24/19 mpg and 16/23/18 mpg. The larger Infiniti QX60 isn’t quite as powerful but manages 21/27/23 mpg with front-wheel and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive, thanks to its continuously variable automatic transmission. The hybrid QX60 has been discontinued for 2016.\n\nInterior\nInside, the Lexus RX gets a makeover with more luxurious materials and better trim and color options. Four colors of leather are available (including dark red, exclusive to the F Sport), as are five trim materials, four of which are real wood veneer in some lovely patterns. The standard 10-way power-adjustable front seats can be upgraded with the optional Luxury Package. With it, they come wrapped in semi-aniline leather and have power lower cushion lengtheners, making these the most comfortable seats in the whole lineup.\n\nIt’s comparable to the quality of an Acura MDX inside, and nicer than a Cadillac SRX or Infiniti QX60. The RX does, however, still trail the German luxury cars in terms of sophistication and feel.\n\nBackseat room is decent, with more legroom than before thanks to a longer wheelbase. Headroom is plentiful, front and rear. All the surfaces you’re likely to touch with either hands or elbows have a premium look and feel, aside from the buttons and switches, which look like they could easily have come from a high-end Toyota-brand model. On the upside, the buttons are mechanical rather than touch-sensitive panels.\n\nOutward visibility is pretty good, with the exception of the rear three-quarters view. Those funky pillars in the cargo area inhibit the view out back, but every other direction offers plenty of open views.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe gauges in base models are clear and easy to read, but the F Sport’s Lexus LFA-inspired gauges are less useful at a glance. The optional premium Mark Levinson audio system is fantastic, but even the mid-grade 12-speaker non-branded system is impressive.\n\nMuch less impressive is the RX’s multimedia system that produces the music as well as navigation and other tech. It doesn’t feature the maddening trackpad like the smaller NX, but it still has a joystick and selector buttons on the console by your hand. Imagine driving down the road while using a laptop computer, with the display screen sitting on the dash and your wireless mouse in your lap, as you try to identify icons on the screen and navigate the cursor to them to select them. This is essentially what Lexus is having drivers do with the RX’s Remote Touch Interface system, and it’s horrible.\n\nThe company is long overdue for rethinking how it approaches its multimedia system, and given that neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are even planned for the RX, it seems the whole multimedia strategy needs a redo if the brand wants to attract younger buyers.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Lexus RX 350 features 18.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, expandable to 56.3 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. The seats do not fold perfectly flat, but it’s close enough as to not matter.\n\nThese numbers, however, are a bit misleading, as they differ considerably from the 2015 model. The 2015 RX 350 had a stated 40.0 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, expandable to 80.3 cubic feet, and the space this year is about the same. We chalk up this model’s smaller numbers to a difference in how Lexus is now measuring cargo space (see an explanation of the problems with measuring cargo space here). The Cadillac SRX has 29.8 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 61.1 cubic feet. Both the MDX and QX60 have third-row seating, expanding their usable passenger area. The MDX features 15.0 cubic feet behind the third row, opening to 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 68.4 cubic feet with all rows stowed. The QX60 is similarly sized, with 15.8 cubic feet behind its third row, 40.8 behind the second and a total cargo volume of 76.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 RX 350 and 450h have not yet been crash-tested.\n\nLexus has bundled many of the RX’s safety features into a new package, called Lexus Safety System Plus. It combines radar-based cruise control, lane keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights, pre-collision preparation with pedestrian cross-traffic detection, blind spot detection, autonomous braking and a few other features into a single high-value package.\n\nWhile the distance-keeping cruise control with automatic stop-and-go worked well, the lane keep assist feature is overly sensitive, vibrating the steering wheel and nudging you back into your lane if you even approach the center line, much less actually cross it. After a couple miles of being forced to meticulously maintain the center of my lane lest my steering wheel continue to vibrate, I switched the feature off. See all the RX 350’s standard safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOverall, legions of happy buyers of the previous three generations of RX SUVs will be perfectly pleased with the new fourth-generation model. If you don’t ask too much of it in terms of spirited driving, it will deliver a quiet, comfortable commute.\n\nPricing for the new Lexus RX was not yet available at publication time, but is not expected to change much from previous years.\n\nBody-type competitors are numerous and varied in their styles, with the big choice seemingly coming in configuration (front- or rear-wheel drive) and interior capacity (two rows or three). The Acura MDX is the competitor most often considered: it’s priced nearly identically, based off a car platform, and has a V-6 and front-wheel drive. It’s a bit bigger than the RX, though, offering three-row seating.\n\nThe same can be said for the Infiniti QX60, which is based on the Nissan Pathfinder and has specs nearly identical to those of the MDX. The Cadillac SRX is a bit smaller than the Lexus RX 350 and decidedly older, but it’s also a five-seat model and features V-6 power and front-wheel drive. It is, however, due to be replaced in 2016 by the heavily revised and larger Cadillac XT5.\n\nemail",

To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Lexus RX 350 was arguably the first luxury crossover on the market. I don’t know about you, but I tend to overlook it: It’s been around forever (since 1998), it hasn’t made any Extreme Makeover-like changes to capture my attention, and it’s driven by seemingly every high-income suburban mom in the carpool lane.\n\nHowever, there’s a reason why so many of them are on the road, and that’s what I had forgotten before driving the 2013 model refreshed my memory.\n\nWith the exception of a few gripes, the 2013 Lexus RX 350 is an absolute pleasure to get into every morning, comforting me in my hectic family routine and offering me support around every corner.\n\nThere are a few updates to the 2013 Lexus RX, most notably a new front-end design. Compare the 2012 and 2013 versions here. The base 2013 model comes with either front- or all-wheel drive. A new F Sport version includes an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, dynamic handling with sport suspension, and a more aggressive-looking grille and front bumper. See the three trim levels compared side by side here. My test car was a base, all-wheel-drive version equipped with the Comfort Package, Luxury Package, Navigation Package and Intuitive Parking Assist system.\n\nThe Lexus RX competes directly with five-seaters like the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX; see them compared here. If you need more seating for your family, you may want to look into the Acura MDX and Infiniti JX35, which have three rows of seats. See the three models compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen the RX first hit the market, it was incredibly progressive with its sleek, rounded lines and low-profile design. Today, that’s the general look that nearly every crossover on the market has emulated. While Lexus should be proud of setting the tone (it’s the highest form of flattery, right?), the downside is that every year the RX slips just a bit further into design obscurity while the rest of the market continues to evolve.\n\nThe step-in height of the RX is just a smidgen high for me to slide into the seat without effort. At 5 feet 3 inches, I need to reach up just a bit on my tippytoes to get in easily, which is great news for the rest of the average-height population. Sliding in and out is assisted by a power seat and steering wheel that automatically adjust to create more space. Keyless entry and start and a power-operated liftgate also make life easier.\n\nMy kids (ages 8, 10 and 12) had no trouble hopping in and out of the RX unassisted.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe RX’s interior is a mix of thoughtful refinement and an apparent attempt to keep its age at bay (like my mom trying to look like a hipster at Starbucks with her MacBook Air, even though she’s still a little unclear about the difference between the internet and email). It initially felt upscale and luxurious, but my discriminating husband couldn’t stop griping about the abundance of “cheap-looking” plastic trim on the steering-wheel and radio surrounds and the trim above the glove box. Honestly, I may not have noticed it if it weren’t for him pointing it out, but once he did I had a hard time ignoring it. There were a few areas with the new high-end-looking black bird’s-eye maple wood trim in my test car, but this should have been carried throughout the cabin.\n\nNote that the RX 350’s standard seats have cloth upholstery. Leather comes standard on the RDX, Q5, MDX, JX35 and several other competitors.\n\nLexus’ supposedly forward-thinking Enform communications center went mostly unused during my test drive. I wasn’t a fan of the mouse-like joystick used to control the screen. (I’d really just prefer a touch-screen, though neat freaks will appreciate not having to obsessively wipe fingerprints off the screen.) While Enform can pair with your smartphone to offer access to apps such as Bing, OpenTable, iHeartRadio and MovieTickets.com through your vehicle’s interface, quite frankly, I’d rather just stick to the familiar interface of my iPhone if I need to make dinner reservations or buy movie tickets on the fly (of course, not while actually driving). I prefer Google to Bing for web and map searches, Urbanspoon to Yelp for restaurant reviews, and Flixster to MovieTickets.com for movie times and tickets. In short, I don’t want my car telling me which apps to use.\n\nIt seems I’m not the only one disenchanted with Enform. User reviews of the accompanying iPhone app range from calling it a “gimmick that doesn’t work” to others who can’t even log in to the system from their phones, instead getting a “permanent rather than intermittent error message.” Yikes. Seems Lexus needs to call a do-over on this one.\n\nThe Connect portion of Enform offers safety services such as roadside assistance, stolen-car recovery and airbag deployment notification. They seem antiquated compared with Hyundai’s Blue Link system, which allows you to preset curfew, geofence and maximum speed limits for the car, and sends you text and email notification alerts when the car goes outside those boundaries. Even GM’s OnStar system gives you access to a live operator to help you through just about anything.\n\nThere were plenty of storage compartments throughout the RX’s interior. I especially appreciated the extra-large pop-out bins in the front door panels. When closed, the low-profile design is unobtrusive, but when popped open they expand to hold water bottles, snacks and all the trash I tend to accumulate through the course of a week.\n\nThe two standard cupholders in the center console for the driver and front passenger have a cover to close them up, streamlining the look of the interior. This is a great feature if, like me, you tend to use your cupholders to store myriad small items (lip balm, tissues, etc.) and you want a quick and easy way to clean up your car. It’s a little like throwing all your stuff in a closet before guests arrive. A third cupholder for the driver pops out of the dash to the left of the steering wheel, just in front of the air vent. I loved having that extra place to store a cup, but since it was right in front of the air vent, stashing my hot latte there cooled my coffee down instead of me.\n\nAn additional small pass-through storage bin under the center console was a great place to stash a small evening bag, though it wasn’t large enough to store my daytime purse, which remained relegated to the passenger footwell.\n\nI really appreciate that the RX gives the driver and front passenger equal seat comfort and adjustability. Both sides feature standard eight-way power adjustment (including adjustable thigh support, which is awesome in our family, given my husband is nearly a foot taller than me). When we’re together as a family, I often ride as a passenger and I hate getting shafted out of the luxury of the driver’s seat. On cold mornings, however, I would definitely be fighting for the driver’s seat in the RX thanks to the heated steering wheel in my test car. Both the driver and passenger seat were heated and cooled, part of a $1,340 Comfort Package. A memory function on the driver’s seat is part of a $4,520 Luxury Package.\n\nMy three girls had more than enough backseat legroom for their legs and their obese backpacks — up to 36.8 inches of it thanks to a sliding rear seat. The seats also recline a bit, which is a huge bonus for my two youngest, who still like to nap in their high-back boosters. I could recline the seat just enough to take the edge off so they could sleep comfortably without slumping forward over their seat belts.\n\nThe kids had access to in-door bottle holders, storage pockets on the back of the front seats, and a center seatback that folded down to provide an armrest with cupholders in it.\n\nThe rear seats are split 40/20/40 and fold flat, expanding the cargo area from 40 cubic feet up to 80.3 cubic feet. These dimensions handily beat the other five-seat models mentioned. The RX’s volume is actually within a few cubic feet of the three-row models — both with their third rows folded and with both rows folded.\n\nYou can fold the RX 350’s seats from the seatback itself or from the cargo area, where you can pull a spring-mounted lever that makes the seats fold down.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDriving the 3.5-liter V-6, all-wheel-drive RX 350 was generally a pleasurable experience, given this isn’t a racecar and isn’t meant to be driven like one. I found its acceleration to be responsive for family-hauling, even while tootling up the hills in my high-altitude ‘hood getting to and from my children’s school. The suspension in the base model was soft enough for the car to be comfortably used as a daily driver. For those wanting a “sportier” ride, the F Sport and its sport tuning is a logical upgrade.\n\nCornering in the RX is about like you’d expect: not as roly-poly as a truck-based SUV, yet not as tight as smaller crossovers, like the Infiniti EX. Falling somewhere in the middle is sure to attract the middle-ground consumer who just wants an easy ride for daily driving chores.\n\nThe RX surprisingly takes regular gas, and with all-wheel drive it gets EPA-estimated fuel economy of 20 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The front-drive version gets an estimated 21 mpg combined. This performance is slightly below average among five-seaters and on the better side compared with larger crossovers. A hybrid version, the Lexus RX 450h, is rated 30 or 29 mpg combined with front- or all-wheel drive, respectively.\n\nWhile the interior of the RX can be incredibly quiet, filtering out an immense amount of road and engine noise, the extra-large side mirrors create more wind noise than expected.\n\nSAFETY\nThe all-wheel-drive 2013 Lexus RX 350 received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (four stars for frontal crash, five stars for side crash and four stars for rollover resistance). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet performed crash tests on the 2013 RX. As is required of all new cars since the 2012 model year, the RX 350 has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. The RX features 10 airbags, including driver and front passenger dual-stage twin chamber airbags, driver and front passenger knee airbags, front- and rear-seat-mounted side-impact airbags, and front and rear side curtain airbags.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, the lower anchors of the Latch system are buried deep within the seat bight and are difficult to access. However, older kids in booster seats will appreciate the easy-to-use seat belt buckles in the two outboard rear seats. They’re on stable bases, making it easy for little hands with limited dexterity to buckle up on their own.\n\nWhile the RX seems to have just about every safety feature on the market today, the lack of a standard blind spot monitor was an annoyance in my test car. Given the super-large side mirrors, I kept hoping they’d have some additional function above and beyond just being a mirror. A blind spot monitoring system is optional. Front and rear parking sensors and a rear backup camera are also options on the RX.\n\nSee all of the RX’s standard safety features here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nThe Lexus RX mid-size luxury SUV is available in gas RX 350 or hybrid RX 450h form. There’s also a performance-oriented F Sport model and extended three-row L versions. All use a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and the RX 450h adds electric motors. The RX 350 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, and the RX 450h is all-wheel-drive only with an electric motor driving the rear wheels. Competitors include the Cadillac XT5 , Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nThe RX’s remote function adds smart watch and Amazon Alexa device compatibility.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard Lexus Safety System Plus includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. The RX 450h’s fuel-saving hybrid drivetrain achieves 30 mpg combined in EPA testing.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nOften credited with creating the luxury crossover SUV class, the Lexus RX continues to please buyers looking for refinement. However, our editors find it less engaging to drive than some competitors and are continually frustrated with its optional Remote Touch multimedia interface.  The cramped third-row seat in extended L versions is of dubious usefulness, too.",

      "expert_review": "The Lexus RX was an early entry into the field of luxury crossover/SUVs — vehicles that wouldn’t look out of place parked in a country club parking lot instead of towing dirt bikes — and it has remained one of the most successful models of all time.\n\nFor 2015, the Lexus RX 350 is a soft, almost numb, car that impresses with its responsive engine and general comfort, but comes up short at offering both a rewarding driving experience and exceptional interior luxury.\n\nThe Lexus RX five-seat SUV comes as both the RX 350 we tested and a hybrid RX 450h version. Sold as the RX 350 since the 2007 model year, the RX was completely redesigned in 2010 and refreshed for the 2013 model year. For 2015, changes are minimal; compare the 2015 with the 2014 here.\n\nThe field that the RX essentially launched in 1999 with the RX 300 has grown, and the RX 350 now faces many competitors, including the Acura MDX, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX. (Run through their highlights here.)\n\nI drove an AWD 2015 Lexus RX 350. The only official trim levels are base and F Sport, but there are many option packages that change the RX’s feature set. Our test vehicle’s Comfort Package added xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, rain-sensing wipers, and heated and ventilated seats. A Navigation Package brought a GPS navigation system with voice command and Lexus’ Enform telematics system, and the Premium Package included, among other things, blind spot monitoring, heated side mirrors, memory seats and roof rails, as well as a wood- and leather-trimmed shift knob and steering wheel.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Lexus RX 350 is powered by a 270-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that’s combined with a six-speed automatic transmission for both front- and all-wheel-drive models. Lexus also offers an F Sport, higher performance trim of the RX 350 that mates the same engine to an eight-speed transmission. F Sport models come only with all-wheel drive and a sport suspension.\n\nThe engine and transmission in our all-wheel-drive test model was the standout positive feature of the car. The Lexus RX 350 responds willingly when you press the gas. It gets up and goes, whether that’s from a stoplight or when you need to pass. One picky editor noticed some hunting for gears in the transmission, but that issue never reared its head in my drive, nor did other editors raise the issue.\n\nThe standout negative feature is the steering: It’s overboosted to the point that there’s no feel for what the car is doing at any speed. Driving around parking lots, that’s a good thing; you’re parking a car, not doing a workout or racing a grand prix. On highway ramps, though, it’s too easy to turn the steering wheel too sharply and wind up in the next lane; there’s nothing at any point to suggest you’re turning the car too tightly for the speed you’re going.\n\nWhy that’s especially bad is that the Lexus RX 350 isolates you from bumps and outside noise really well.  At highway speeds, it was eerie how there was simply no discernable wind noise. That’s nice, but until I got used to the RX 350, I took a few highway off-ramps too quickly because my speed wasn’t immediately obvious.\n\nThe too-light steering meant there were a few anxious moments. Instead of feeling the road, I was looking at it and sort of guessing what was going on. The RX 350 reduces your communication with the road to a whisper.\n\nOverall, the Lexus RX 350 is best-suited for long drives on long, straight interstates, where you’d just as soon relax, take your time and arrive at your destination not feeling like you just got out of a bar fight. For that, it’s one of the better entries in the field.\n\nWhen it comes to cruising along, it’s worth noting that FWD Lexus RX 350 models are rated 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined. All-wheel-drive models with the six-speed automatic transmission get 18/24/20 mpg, and RX 350s with the eight-speed transmission get slightly higher mileage estimates, at 18/26/21 mpg. Premium fuel is recommended.\n\nInterior\nJust judging the quality of materials and general layout, my first thought was, “Boy, this is one nice Toyota.” (Toyota is the parent company of Lexus.) The problem is, you’re paying Lexus prices — including $2,760 for the Premium Package — to get that interior.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying the Lexus RX 350’s interior is ugly or has poor quality. I just wasn’t wowed the way I have been by other vehicles in the class — notably the Acura MDX and Audi Q5. Also, I felt like some of the knobs and buttons would look right at home in a Toyota Highlander. That’s not what you want in a luxury offering.\n\nAs I got to know the Lexus more, though, there were a few things I really liked. For starters, in this age, when more and more luxury cars have adjustments for suspension settings, steering response and transmission shift points, the Lexus doesn’t confound you with choices right away. Instead, the driver’s impression will be that the engineers have sorted it all out for you; you just need to get in and drive.\n\nAnother welcome feature is that backseat room is acceptable for taller adults. I’m 6-foot-2, and I had decent headroom and legroom sitting behind the driver’s seat where I’d positioned it to drive. The seat is somewhat low, so my knees were raised a bit more than I’d want them to be for a long drive, but it didn’t feel as tight or claustrophobic as some competitors.\n\nFinally, those same buttons and knobs I mentioned earlier had a solid feel that does Lexus credit. However, Lexus altered one major control for 2015, and in doing so messed up a good thing. Other Lexus models use a controller knob that you manipulate like a mouse to select various menu items. It was a nice system. I was a fan of it.\n\nThis version misses the mark. There’s little feedback, and it’s virtually impossible to land on the menu item you want. It’s not that the appearance of the knob has changed, but it’s a different configuration that’s a lot harder to use. Where there used to be buttons beside the controller that could be used to make a selection, those buttons are now gone and you have to make selections by pressing down on the controller knob. It’s too easy to “slip” when manipulating the knob and select, say, the wrong letter while inputting an address.\n\nThe best way to imagine it is thus: Picture there are three menu items and you want to select the middle item. You can’t. Well, OK, technically you can, but if you can select it the first time — without first skipping over it — I commend you, because I certainly couldn’t. (And I’m a child of the video game generation, for Pete’s sake.) It’s so disconnected and numb it feels impossible to do; it’s frustrating, and it never got any easier despite repeated attempts.\n\nFortunately, Lexus provides many buttons in the interior that allow you to skip the controller. That’s not just nice, it’s necessary — and the fact that the buttons are necessary suggests there’s a flaw in the setup.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Lexus RX 350 offers a large cargo area that you’d hope to find in an SUV. Nice touches include levers in the side of the cargo bay that fold flat the spring-tensioned seats. Also, there are four cargo tie-downs that are necessary if you’re using a cargo net, and nice to have if you’re securing something like a bike.\n\nWith 40.0 cubic feet of space behind the seats, the RX 350 bests the Acura MDX (38.4 cubic feet), Audi Q5 (29.1) and Cadillac SRX (29.8 cubic feet) when you’re carrying people in the backseat. It’s the same story with the seats folded, as the RX 350’s overall cargo room (80.3 cubic feet) beats its competitors by more than 11.5 cubic feet. (Compare maximum luggage volume here.)\n\nThe RX 350 has a 40/20/40-split backseat, which reclines and slides without exposing a gap in the cargo floor, as some SUVs do. Pull the handles in the cargo area to lower it and it automatically retracts to its farthest-back position (if it’s slid forward) to ensure no gap. The lack of a gap is a thoughtful detail.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Lexus RX 350 has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but a spokesperson for the institute said results from 2014 should carry over to the 2015 model. The 2014 model was a Top Safety Pick for the institute, meaning it scored the institute’s highest rating of good in all crash tests. As of this writing, the institute has no plans to put the RX 350 through its small overlap front-impact crash test, which would determine the RX 350’s eligibility for the institute’s highest rating of Top Safety Pick Plus.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the 2015 Lexus RX 350 earned four stars overall out of five when equipped with front-wheel drive and five out of five with all-wheel drive. NHTSA says the difference is because of the additional weight of the all-wheel-drive hardware, as well as a slightly lower center of gravity for the all-wheel-drive model that resulted in a better rollover score and, thus, a better overall rating.\n\nStandard safety features include Lexus’ Safety Connect feature that calls for help automatically when an airbag is deployed. The system also provides an SOS button to request emergency assistance. This feature, while standard, is free only for one year; after that, owners must pay a subscription.\n\nOur test car came with the Premium Package that, among other features, also includes a blind spot monitoring system and a pre-collision system that includes adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning. A pre-brake system that cinches the seat belts and readies the brakes for stronger stopping power is also included in the package.\n\nFinally, see how child-safety seats fit in our Car Seat Check, and check out the RX’s full list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOur test model rolled in at $51,000, including a $910 destination charge and a $1,400 premium for AWD, as well as nearly $8,000 in options. Still, that falls within the range of competitors such as the Acura MDX, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX.\n\nThe Lexus RX 350 is in the middle of a mileage competition with the Acura, Audi and Cadillac. The RX 350 with FWD gets an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined, which trails the Acura MDX’s 23 mpg and the AWD, gas-powered Q5’s 23 mpg, but beats the SRX’s combined mileage of 19 mpg.\n\nWith all-wheel drive, it’s the same story: The RX 350 is rated 20 mpg combined for the version we tested, which trails the Acura’s 21 mpg and the Audi’s 23 mpg, but beats the Cadillac’s 18 mpg.\n\nThe numbers are close, but if mileage is the criterion, it’s worth considering the higher-mileage RX 450h hybrid version, which gets an EPA-estimated 32/28/30 mpg with front-wheel drive and 30/28/29 mpg with all-wheel drive. That car could conceivably be cross-shopped with the TDI (diesel) version of Audi’s Q5 with standard all-wheel drive, which is rated 24/31/27 mpg by the EPA.\n\nBetween its front-wheel-drive, all-wheel-drive and hybrid versions, there is at least one RX that can help shoppers interested in saving money. But “value” isn’t always about being the cheapest; it’s delivering on the money that’s invested. Here, the Lexus largely does well, but there are tradeoffs. The driving experience isn’t rewarding for those who want to be involved. The car’s too numb for that. Also, I really think the controller inside is worth calling out because it just doesn’t work well. I never got comfortable with it, and flipping through multimedia/information screens has become more common in cars than manually shifting gears. It’s not an area an automaker can afford to mess up, and I feel Lexus has.\n\nThe positives are what you’d want in a luxury car: It’s soft, quiet and really eats up the miles on the highway. In other words, that same “numb” sensation that dulls the pleasures of sporty drivers pays off for those willing to be more relaxed in getting where they’re going. It’s a very comfortable car.\n\nThe RX is still a very good luxury SUV. After breaking new ground many years ago, Lexus has not screwed it up overall, but the company hasn’t universally improved it, either.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Lexus RX 350 was written in October 2015, but little has changed for 2017 aside from many safety features now being made standard, plus the addition of a front-wheel-drive F-Sport model. To see everything that’s changed for 2017, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of model years, click here.\n\nSince its introduction in 1998, the Lexus RX midsize luxury SUV has been a hit. It’s one of the few luxury vehicles of any type that regularly sells more than 100,000 units a year in the U.S. It’s been a boon for the Lexus brand. But Lexus has always played it safe with the RX, with styling that was warm but never hot and driving dynamics that were pleasing but never entertaining.\n\nThe new 2016 RX 350 and RX 450h hybrid are the latest attempts to inject some youthful exuberance into the Lexus lexicon, but with many changes that don’t go much more than skin-deep, has Lexus gone far enough to attract new buyers?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nTo paraphrase style maven Tim Gunn, the 2016 Lexus RX has a whole lot of look. From the pointed, gaping, spindle-shaped grille up front to the hash work of character lines down the side and a floating roof element that is dangerously close to becoming the latest styling element that every automaker incorporates, the new RX is highly distinctive. And yet, it works.\n\nThis may be the first instance of Lexus’ dramatic new styling coming together cohesively in an appealing manner. The new RX looks modern and distinctive, and the proportions are well-suited to the look. It’s a little bit longer and marginally wider, mostly to give backseat passengers more legroom, but the RX looks good from any angle.\n\nLED headlights and taillights can be had, and even an upgraded premium tri-lens package light can be optioned, which features LED cornering lights and rear turn signals. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard, but 20-inch wheels are optional, an inch larger than the 2015 unit offered. They fill out the wheel wells nicely and add to the RX’s high-tech look.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe RX comes in four flavors: the base RX 350, the RX 350 F Sport, the RX 450h hybrid and new for 2016, an RX 450h F Sport. The base model’s 3.5-liter V-6 is basically unchanged from 2015 aside from a modest 25-horsepower bump. The eight-speed automatic that was only available on the 2015 RX 350 F Sport is now standard on the RX 350 too. The result is an acceptably quick SUV that delivers thrust in a smooth flow, with shifts that are unobtrusive and practically seamless.\n\nThe transmission does hunt a bit during spirited driving, but with eight speeds to play with, that’s to be expected. The result of that hunting is a vehicle that’s always ready with power when you need it; the powertrain, in fact, is the best part of the RX experience.\n\nIf you’d rather pay a little more money for better fuel economy, the RX 450h hybrid isn’t a bad way to do it, with just as much power on tap when you need it, but the added benefit of limited EV operation when you don’t. It makes a total of 308 system hp from a combination of the V-6 and electric motors. The hybrid still uses a heavy nickel-metal-hydride battery instead of a lighter, more power-dense lithium-ion one, but it’s been repackaged so it no longer intrudes into the cargo or rear passenger space.\n\nFrom a powertrain standpoint, there isn’t much of a downside to opting for the hybrid. Throttle response is delayed a bit as it passes through an initial EV mode before employing the gasoline engine, but the hybrid performs remarkably similarly to the gas-only model. It’s worlds better than the outgoing RX hybrid.\n\nThe rest of the RX 350 is less entertaining.\n\nIts steering is nicely balanced, but it feels slow to react. In normal driving through parking lots and interstate roads, it won’t be an issue, but when trying to negotiate switchbacks or mountain twisties, it becomes more apparent. The RX 350 is prone to understeer in both front- and all-wheel-drive versions, with pronounced body roll that makes the heavy SUV push through corners instead of slice neatly through them.\n\nIt is not nearly as athletic as a BMW X5 or Audi Q5, but its heft and damping give it a solidity and stability that is lacking from vehicles like the Cadillac SRX. The brakes are unimpressive, providing little feedback. Using them almost feels like you’ve pushed a “brakes button” instead of a pedal — they’re working, but it doesn’t feel like there’s much mechanical action happening underfoot; the RX’s mass once again is acutely felt.\n\nBoth the RX 350 and RX 450h can be had with an F Sport trim aimed at changing the driving experience to something more appealing to German-luxury buyers. The F Sport trim doesn’t get any more power; its mechanical changes are limited to firmer suspension tuning, a special transmission shift program and less power-steering assist, for better feedback. There are also some added appearance items inside and out.\n\nRequired steering effort goes up noticeably in F Sport versions. If you use the multimode selector dial to switch into Sport S or Sport S+ modes, it goes up even more dramatically. Transmission and accelerator responsiveness also get much more aggressive, and the adaptive suspension that’s unique to the F Sport stiffens the ride considerably. Unfortunately, none of this translates into a more capable vehicle. It’s still just as heavy as the base model and features significant understeer and body roll.\n\nIt may feel sportier, but the F Sport’s changes don’t improve the RX’s abilities. I would opt for a base RX 350 over the F Sport and its more heavily bolstered sport seats (which are too small, too firm and too rigidly bolstered) and less informative gauge package. The more affordable version is much more pleasant to drive, more comfortable and quieter to boot.\n\nFuel economy is above average for both RX models. The RX 350 is estimated to achieve 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. The 450h is a bit better, with an estimated 31/30/30 mpg in front-drive models and 30/28/30 mpg with all-wheel drive. Most of the benefit comes in city driving thanks to the hybrid’s gas-saving low-speed EV mode.\n\nIn comparison, the Acura MDX gets nearly identical numbers, with 20/27/23 mpg and 19/26/22 mpg with front- and all-wheel drive, respectively. Cadillac’s SRX gets a much worse 17/24/19 mpg and 16/23/18 mpg. The larger Infiniti QX60 isn’t quite as powerful but manages 21/27/23 mpg with front-wheel and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive, thanks to its continuously variable automatic transmission. The hybrid QX60 has been discontinued for 2016.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the RX gets a makeover with more luxurious materials and better trim and color options. Four colors of leather are available (including dark red, exclusive to the F Sport), as are five trim materials, four of which are real wood veneer in some lovely patterns. The standard 10-way power-adjustable front seats can be upgraded with the optional Luxury Package. With it, they come wrapped in semi-aniline leather and have power lower cushion lengtheners, making these the most comfortable seats in the whole lineup.\n\nIt’s comparable to the quality of an Acura MDX inside, and nicer than a Cadillac SRX or Infiniti QX60. The RX does, however, still trail the German luxury cars in terms of sophistication and feel.\n\nBackseat room is decent, with more legroom than before thanks to a longer wheelbase. Headroom is plentiful, front and rear. All the surfaces you’re likely to touch with either hands or elbows have a premium look and feel, aside from the buttons and switches, which look like they could easily have come from a high-end Toyota-brand model. On the upside, the buttons are mechanical rather than touch-sensitive panels.\n\nOutward visibility is pretty good, with the exception of the rear three-quarters view. Those funky pillars in the cargo area inhibit the view out back, but every other direction offers plenty of open views.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe gauges in base models are clear and easy to read, but the F Sport’s Lexus LFA-inspired gauges are less useful at a glance. The optional premium Mark Levinson audio system is fantastic, but even the mid-grade 12-speaker non-branded system is impressive.\n\nMuch less impressive is the RX’s multimedia system that produces the music as well as navigation and other tech. It doesn’t feature the maddening trackpad like the smaller NX, but it still has a joystick and selector buttons on the console by your hand. Imagine driving down the road while using a laptop computer, with the display screen sitting on the dash and your wireless mouse in your lap, as you try to identify icons on the screen and navigate the cursor to them to select them. This is essentially what Lexus is having drivers do with the RX’s Remote Touch Interface system, and it’s horrible.\n\nThe company is long overdue for rethinking how it approaches its multimedia system, and given that neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are even planned for the RX, it seems the whole multimedia strategy needs a redo if the brand wants to attract younger buyers.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe RX 350 features 18.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, expandable to 56.3 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. The seats do not fold perfectly flat, but it’s close enough as to not matter.\n\nThese numbers, however, are a bit misleading, as they differ considerably from the 2015 model. The 2015 RX 350 had a stated 40.0 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, expandable to 80.3 cubic feet, and the space this year is about the same. We chalk up this model’s smaller numbers to a difference in how Lexus is now measuring cargo space (see an explanation of the problems with measuring cargo space here). The Cadillac SRX has 29.8 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 61.1 cubic feet. Both the MDX and QX60 have third-row seating, expanding their usable passenger area. The MDX features 15.0 cubic feet behind the third row, opening to 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 68.4 cubic feet with all rows stowed. The QX60 is similarly sized, with 15.8 cubic feet behind its third row, 40.8 behind the second and a total cargo volume of 76.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 RX 350 and 450h have not yet been crash-tested.\n\nLexus has bundled many of the RX’s safety features into a new package, called Lexus Safety System Plus. It combines radar-based cruise control, lane keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights, pre-crash preparation with pedestrian detection, autonomous braking and a few other features into a single high-value package.\n\nWhile the distance-keeping cruise control with automatic stop-and-go worked well, the lane keep assist feature is overly sensitive, vibrating the steering wheel and nudging you back into your lane if you even approach the center line, much less actually cross it. After a couple miles of being forced to meticulously maintain the center of my lane lest my steering wheel continue to vibrate, I switched the feature off. See all the RX 350’s standard safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nOverall, legions of happy buyers of the previous three generations of RX SUVs will be perfectly pleased with the new fourth-generation model. If you don’t ask too much of it in terms of spirited driving, it will deliver a quiet, comfortable commute.\n\nPricing for the new RX was not yet available at publication time, but is not expected to change much from previous years.\n\nCompetitors are numerous and varied in their styles, with the big choice seemingly coming in configuration (front- or rear-wheel drive) and interior capacity (two rows or three). The Acura MDX is the competitor most often considered: it’s priced nearly identically, based off a car platform, and has a V-6 and front-wheel drive. It’s a bit bigger than the RX, though, offering three-row seating.\n\nThe same can be said for the Infiniti QX60, which is based on the Nissan Pathfinder and has specs nearly identical to those of the MDX. The Cadillac SRX is a bit smaller than the RX 350 and decidedly older, but it’s also a five-seat model and features V-6 power and front-wheel drive. It is, however, due to be replaced in 2016 by the heavily revised and larger Cadillac XT5.",

      "expert_review": "Up until the 2020 Lexus RX, every modern Lexus came with an annoying asterisk: Yes, it was a fine vehicle, but the touchpad or mouselike multimedia controls were so confounding and frustrating that it eventually made you think Luddites had it pretty good. So what’s changed for 2020? The updated 2020 Lexus RX ditches the mouse and adds a touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, addressing one (or is it several?) of the luxury SUV’s weakest areas.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX and RXL Preview: Rejuvenating an Aging Icon\n\nThe 2020 Lexus RX isn’t without its quirks; the asterisk is just a little smaller. The touchscreen and tech enhancements are the most significant changes for 2020, though a bunch of little things — new smartphone holder, over-the-air updates, expanded F-Sport line — have similar executions: They sound great on paper but are a little less impressive in practice. The bulk of the RX is unchanged, available in five-seat RX 350 and hybrid RX 450h variants, along with an L version of each that includes a small third row for a total of six or seven seats.\n\nBring on the Touchscreen!\n\nWe all gasped when we heard Lexus was getting a touchscreen — actually, it was a sigh of relief — because the way the previous Lexus RX controlled the non-touch display distracted drivers, requiring them to use the mouse to select a little button. No longer, as the 2020 RX gets a standard 8-inch touchscreen or the optional, vibrant 12.3-inch touchscreen I sampled. Lexus moved the screen 5 inches closer to the driver for 2020, though that might not be enough. I’m 6 feet tall with long arms and like to sit fairly close to the wheel, so I didn’t have a problem using the screen while driving, but the touchscreen might prove too far to be useful if you have shorter arms and/or like to sit farther back; I had to fully extend my arm to reach the far end of the screen. Oddly, Lexus’ Remote Touchpad, seen in other models, snuck into the party when no one was looking, but it’s relatively obsolete in this application because of the touchscreen, and I used it only for the menu button during my short drive. If you can’t reach the touchscreen, the touchpad is how you’ll have to control CarPlay/Android Auto; Godspeed, you poor short-armed bastard.\n\nMy preference is the RX’s widescreen format — a style also offered on the BMW X5 — versus the vertically oriented touchscreen in a Volvo XC90. I exclusively use Apple CarPlay while driving, and CarPlay fills the entire display on widescreens like the Lexus, versus on a Volvo where CarPlay is stuck in a little box on the bottom half of the screen, barely larger than the plus-sized phone providing the function. In the RX, all 12.3 inches show CarPlay, so the buttons are large and easy to press (if you can reach them), and annoyingly long podcast titles that would normally be cut off in a small screen are fully displayed.\n\nOver-the-Air Map Updates\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor those who don’t use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which provide navigation from a smartphone, the optional built-in navigation system is quite good and boosted for 2020 with more humanized voice recognition (it recognized numerous ways I asked to get to the nearest Starbucks). Most notable is that there are now over-the-air navigation updates that replace the need for a physical SD card. This isn’t the first Lexus to receive the system, named Dynamic Navigation, but it’s new to the RX. When maps are updated, the update comes straight into the RX via the onboard cellular connection. The functionality is active only if you subscribe to Lexus’ Enform cellular service, however, which comes with a free three-year trial before a subscription is required, and the updates are good only for navigation. Unlike the Tesla Model X, you won’t be getting vehicle functionality or systems updates. Those kinds of updates aren’t out of scope, however, as Lexus College senior product specialist Bob Gleich says there are numerous regulatory hoops Lexus must hop through first before that can happen.\n\nCellphone Holder — Brilliant Idea, So-So Execution\n\nLexus has an intriguing solution for storing phones, a center console cellphone pocket. The sizable slot was large enough to hold my iPhone Plus, which is impressive because my monster of a phone is wrapped in a toddler-proof thick, shock-resistant case. The holder stands the phone up vertically so it’s not using storage space in the cubby if laid down flat. Another bonus: The phone won’t fly out of a bin when accelerating like it does in some cars. On the downside, this cubby won’t wirelessly charge your phone, and CarPlay isn’t wireless as in some BMWs and Audis, so you’ll have to string a data/charge cable across the cupholders to the center console. Oddly, the USB ports literally right next to the phone holder are charge only, and not data ports that stream CarPlay/Android Auto and music to the media system like in the center console storage bin.\n\nDouble the F Sport\n\nThe sportier RX F Sport trim comes in two flavors for 2020, a regular F Sport with unique grille, tuned-up shock absorbers and fancy wheels, while an F Sport Performance is new, though I question the value in that package. The $4,850 F Sport Performance Package adds adaptive shocks with adjustable firmness similar to the Lexus LC 500 sports car, which is perhaps the one Lexus where its goofy controls can be glossed over because it’s that good. Lexus calls this adaptive variable suspension, but the RX with this heightened package remains one of the more buttery riding SUVs out there, even in the most aggressive Sport Plus mode that you don’t get on lesser RXs. The RX F Sport Performance Package remains perfectly comfortable for everyday use while giving you a shred of road feel you don’t get on the base suspension car (non-F Sport). When thrown into a corner, however, there aren’t the chops that would make you want to do it again, and the Sport Plus mode doesn’t do the engine and transmission any favors because it shifts conservatively, upshifting mid-corner and trying to get to the next gear as soon as possible. The paddle shifters work well here for maintaining a gear, but it’s not unique to the F Sport any longer because all RXs get steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual gear control, even the hybrid RX 450h.\n\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe F Sport Performance Package adds a sound tube for an extra bit of noise from under the hood, doing it mechanically versus electronic augmentation, according to Gleich, and you can hear a little extra muscly sound between 5,000 and 6,000 rpm, though only briefly. I haven’t driven the non-Performance-Package F Sport, but compared with the regular RX I drove, I don’t think you’ll be missing much if you skip the F Sport Performance Package.\n\nShould You Buy the 2019 or 2020 Lexus RX?\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne new feature worth mentioning is the RX’s newly available kick-to-open tailgate, which like many of the 2020 additions normalizes the RX a tad more. Previously, you had to hold your hand over the Lexus badge to open it (doesn’t make much sense for a hands-free system), and now with a handful of groceries the rear power tailgate can be opened with a quick kick under the center of the bumper. In my testing, this worked five out of five times, an accomplishment for these types of systems that don’t always trigger when asked.\n\nIf you’ve deemed the RX’s size and price a good fit, then actively seek out the 2020 RX, which addresses one of the RX’s biggest shortcomings thanks to a more normalized control system and a host of new connectivity features.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThe five-seat Lexus RX mid-size luxury SUV is available in gas RX 350 or hybrid RX 450h form. There’s also a performance-oriented F Sport model and a three-row L version that seats up to seven. All use a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and the RX 450h adds electric motors.\n\nThe RX 350 is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The RX 450h is all-wheel-drive only, with an electric motor driving the rear wheels. Competitors include the Cadillac XT5, Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather-trimmed interior\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nMark Levinson premium stereo\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nOften credited with creating the luxury crossover SUV class, the Lexus RX continues to please buyers looking for refinement, but our editors find it less engaging to drive than some competitors. The Remote Touch multimedia interface remains frustrating, but the inclusion of a touchscreen makes it less of an issue than it was previously. The cramped third row in extended L versions is of dubious usefulness.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert and power-folding, auto-dimming side mirrors now standard; wireless charging now available; new Glazed Caramel interior color available; F Sport Performance Package renamed F Sport Handling Package\n\nPrice change: $920 for two-row; $600 for three-row L versions\n\nOn sale: Early fall\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? The price increase for L models is modest enough that it seems worth it for the additional content compared to a 2020. Two-row models may require more careful consideration of price and features. \n\nAfter significant updates for the 2020 model year, Lexus announced mild updates to its popular RX line of SUVs for 2021, including additional standard safety technology and convenience features.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX Review: Just What the Doctor Ordered\n\nPricing\n\nPricing for the entry-level models is below. Two-row models increase by $920 while the three-row L versions are $600 more expensive.\n\n2021 RX 350 (FWD): $46,095 (up $920 over 2020)\n2021 RX 450h (AWD): $48,745 (up $920)\n2021 RX 350L (FWD): $48,925 (up $600)\n2021 RX 450hL (AWD): $52,135 (up $600) \nOptions\n\nBuyers can add an F Sport appearance package to the two-row 350 and 450h for an additional $3,480, giving the SUV a more aggressive look and adding things like F Sport-specific front seats. \n\nOn top of that, there’s an F Sport Handling (nee Performance) Package that adds an adaptive suspension, sport steering, sound enhancement and, in the 350, Lexus’ Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management system (already standard on the hybrid 450h). That will cost an additional $2,400 on the 350 and $2,320 on the 450h, on top of the $3,480 for the appearance package. (Technically, the Handling package is only $1,050 or $970, respectively, but it seems to require the addition of a power moonroof and aluminum roof rails for an extra $1,350.) \n\nThe Black Line appearance package is available on the RX 350 and 450h F Sport. Building on the F Sport, for an additional $685 it adds trendy darkened exterior accents.\n\nThree-row models don’t offer F Sport anything, but can be upgraded with a $6,000 Luxury Package that adds higher-quality interior materials, different wheels and additional comfort and convenience features.\n\nRelease Date\n\nLexus says 2021 models should start arriving at dealerships early this fall, so expect to see them available soon.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Lexus RX is a bold redesign of a comfort-focused favorite that adds a large amount of flair without destroying its relaxed ride quality.\n\nVersus the competition: The RX’s new turbocharged four-cylinder engine isn’t unexpected in the class, but it struggles to offer a premium experience in the RX 350. Other qualities, however, are successfully luxurious.\n\nThe Lexus RX is known and loved as a comfortable luxury SUV with a roomy interior and smooth, quiet driving manners. The 2023 RX is coming in with a ground-up redesign with claims of athleticism, including a new RX 500h F Sport Performance hybrid with all-wheel drive and advertisements that even show an RX on a racetrack (gasp). I appreciated the previous RX’s place in the class as an aggressive-looking crossover, but one that didn’t have a firm, unpleasant ride — so my biggest question going into Lexus’ first drive event for the 2023 RX was whether we’ve lost one of our favorite comfort options in the class. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2023 Lexus RX Sports New Platform, Powertrains, Performance Variant\n\nNo More V-6 Engine\n\nOne thing that’s for sure gone is the previous generation’s 295-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. What was a buttery smooth, refined V-6 has been replaced by a 275-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, which isn’t an uncommon engine type among the competitors Lexus is targeting, including the Volvo XC90 and Mercedes-Benz GLE; the Acura MDX and BMW X5, two other competitors, use six-cylinder holdouts. However, while the RX’s new four-cylinder is more efficient by 2 mpg in combined ratings (22 mpg for the V-6 with AWD versus 24 mpg for the four-cylinder with AWD), it now requires more expensive premium fuel versus regular gas like the old V-6. With only a paltry increase in fuel economy ratings but a significant difference in the price of premium versus regular, at gas prices as of this writing, the new engine will cost buyers more to refuel than the outgoing V-6.\n\nThe question now becomes: Does the performance difference make the new engine more enticing? The answer: Not really. The 2.4-liter has 20 fewer horsepower, but even 50 more pounds-feet of torque than the V-6 can’t help the driving experience feel premium. The 317 pounds-feet of torque helps acceleration at lower engine speeds, but it’s not transformative and there’s not much zip in its acceleration overall (0-60 mph arrives in 7.2 seconds with AWD, according to Lexus). Like many of the entry-level turbo four-cylinders in competitors, the 2.4-liter’s sound is coarse and unrefined. There’s also less consistent power delivery than the old V-6; a prod of the accelerator often results in significant acceleration lag. Shoppers coming from luxury brands that already use turbo four-cylinders might not think twice about the new engine’s sound, but Lexus faithful will miss their V-6.\n\nThere’s more goodness in other powertrains. Now dubbed the RX 350h instead of RX 450h, the hybrid is the sweet spot in the RX lineup, though Lexus is projecting just 17% of sales will be the RX 350h. With a combined 246 hp from its gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain that includes a rear traction motor for standard AWD, the 350h is more responsive than the turbocharged 2.4-liter — perhaps thanks to its boost coming from electrons versus exhaust gases — and uses a quick-acting continuously variable-style automatic transmission. Sure, the non-turbo 2.5-liter gas engine is noisy, too, and requires premium fuel like the outgoing hybrid, but it makes up for that annoyance with a 12 mpg improvement in combined fuel economy versus the base four-cylinder with a rating of 36 mpg combined; that’s an impressive 6 mpg better than the previous-generation hybrid. Add in the barely perceivable difference in acceleration between the hybrid and the base engine — 0-60 mph in 7.4 seconds for the hybrid, just 0.2 second slower than the AWD RX 350 — and the RX 350h is a highlight of the RX lineup.\n\nThere’s a third variant available at launch: the RX 500h F Sport Performance AWD hybrid, which uses its hybrid powertrain to boost performance, not fuel economy — a divergence from Lexus’ typical hybrid strategy. By pairing the RX 350’s turbocharged 275-hp engine with an EV-spec, 80-kilowatt rear electric motor and six-speed automatic transmission, the combined output is 366 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque. Fuel economy is 27 mpg combined versus 24 mpg for the 350 AWD and 36 mpg for the hybrid.\n\nThe RX 500h F Sport Performance delivers great passing power, but power delivery surges between the two power units versus acting as one unified propulsion force. We were driving early pre-production units (production doesn’t start until October), so Lexus has time for more fine-tuning ahead of production if they decide to make changes.\n\nThen there’s the overall modest acceleration for a “performance” variant: 0-60 mph in a claimed 5.9 seconds, which feels less impressive on the road where the reality of trying to move 4,750 pounds with 366 hp sets in. There’s enough oomph for the RX 500h F Sport Performance to serve as a more powerful alternative to the base variant, but calling it a “performance” model is a stretch.\n\nThe fourth powertrain is the RX 450h Plus, a gas-electric plug-in hybrid with short all-electric range (at least compared with a full EV). As of publication, there are few details on the RX 450h Plus and no announced on-sale date for what will surely be a hot item.\n\nRemains Roomy — for Some\n\nThe previous two-row, five-seat Lexus RX wasn’t short on interior space, but the three-row L version was stretched pretty thin. The L model has been dropped for 2023, and the redesigned RX has a longer wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear wheels) that Lexus says offers more rear legroom than the previous SUV. A redesigned rear suspension is more compact than before, said to provide additional cabin space for people and cargo.\n\nTo my eyes, the RX has a striking new design, but what’s indisputable is how that new shape affects interior room because the car is lower overall and the roof has an aggressive slope. Compared with the 2022 RX, the new model’s dimensions are similar up front and it’s roomy in back, too, but rear headroom might be an issue for taller passengers when the SUV is equipped with the available panoramic moonroof that stretches into the backseat. With it, rear headroom is cut 1.6 inches versus the normal roof and standard moonroof, and my head hit the top of the interior when the reclining backseat was in its fully upright position (I’m 6 feet tall). I could alleviate the head contact by reclining the seat, but that resulted in an uncomfortable seating position. Those needing to carry taller people in the backseat should consider an RX with the standard moonroof because of its greater rear headroom.\n\nInterior quality is a step up from the previous generation. Quality is more consistent throughout the cabin, and while the interior quality itself isn’t a knockout punch to any competitors, it’s more competitive. The old RX has great details in some areas, like the dashboard padding and stitching, but it cheaped out elsewhere. One area that stands out in the new RX is an available suede door panel design, which is standard on the RX 350 Luxury, RX 350 F Sport Handling and RX 500h F Sport Performance AWD trim levels. The suede insert is subtle, but it’s the first thing you see when you step into the cabin and the last thing you see before closing the door, so the material and design leaves a high-quality impression.\n\nStill the Comfort Option?\n\nI feel fairly confident the RX remains a comfort option in the class, though I am curious how well it will drive on the poor roads surrounding Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters versus the coastal California roads Lexus chose for its drive event program. Lexus brought a previous-generation RX 350 to drive for comparisons, and the back-to-back experience showed where Lexus most significantly improved the RX’s ride quality. The RX is built on a new platform with increased rigidity that helps decrease noise, vibration and harshness, as well as improve ride and handling.\n\nThe previous generation rode softly, but it didn’t have sophisticated chassis and suspension control, so it felt uncontrolled when you hit significant road imperfections. The new RX has a connected driving feel rather than the soft but sloppy handling of the previous SUV, and it does this while maintaining decently soft ride quality that won’t turn off comfort-oriented buyers. Even with large available 21-inch wheels, it rides well, which is no small feat. The new RX is quieter, too, with less road noise on the highway, which makes it not only a suitable successor to the previous RX, but also a stout highway cruiser when compared with the competition.\n\nAn available adjustable-firmness adaptive suspension goes in the RX 350 F Sport Handling and RX 500h F Sport Performance AWD, and Lexus says it offers a comfortable ride with improved stability and superior steering response. No matter which suspension you get, however, the RX’s reflexes don’t feel especially sharp, and a lot of that is because the steering wheel is very well isolated from road feel. That’s great for a luxury car, but not so great for a performance vehicle. There are other reasons to pick the F Sport Handling or F Sport Performance hybrid, like styling or more power, but being fun to drive isn’t one of them.\n\nI also couldn’t tell much of a difference in ride firmness or handling while playing with the SUV’s drive modes, which was strange because adaptive suspensions often have the ability to change a vehicle’s character; perhaps the differences will come through more when we spend time with the RX on familiar roads. The RX 500h’s handling is more defined by its powertrain torque split than suspension tuning, however, because the rear motor actively helps the SUV accelerate versus only being a tractive force when front wheel slippage is detected. This approach gives the RX 500h rear-wheel-drive-like flair; punch the accelerator from a stop and the rear wheels will spin, wiggling the rear end.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe 2023 RX has a standard 9.8-inch touchscreen as well as an available 14-inch touchscreen that’s the eye-catcher of the interior more than any cabin quality highlight. More importantly, there’s no more console-mounted touchpad controller, so we can all rejoice for (mostly) normalized controls.\n\nThe screen showcases vibrant colors, high resolution and is the primary way users interact with aspects of the SUV, including the climate control, heated and ventilated seats, and heated steering wheel. Thankfully, Lexus surfaces them on the screen so they’re easy to access rather than burying them.\n\nThe available head-up display may be a point of frustration for some because with it comes a unique control system for the steering wheel controls. Instead of the steering wheel’s directional pads being marked with symbols, they’re blank, and their assignment changes based on what function you’re controlling, which is shown in the HUD. If you can see the HUD, it’s fine, but the HUD can be distorted by polarized sunglasses, and that can make it difficult to use the steering wheel controls to change audio tracks or use adaptive cruise control functions.\n\nAll media screens have wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and CarPlay, unlike with some automakers’ media systems, stretches across the whole screen rather than using a portion of it.\n\nOther trick technology includes an available under-car camera that provides a see-through view from the top down via the center touchscreen. While this technology was initially used to aid off-road driving, it’s just as useful in urban parking situations. One feature that might get turned off the next time I drive an RX, however, is the available driver monitor system, which can be overly aggressive with beeps and alerts even when you’re paying attention to the road.\n\n2023 Lexus RX in the Market\n\nWithout knowing pricing, which wasn’t available at publication, it’s hard to gauge the 2023 RX’s value. The 2022 RX 350 starts around $47,000 (including destination), which undercut many competitors that started in the $50,000-plus range. Some areas of the outgoing RX were definitely value-oriented, but even if the 2023 model is slightly more expensive, the standard-configuration RX would offer great value based on how it drives. That said, the entry-level turbocharged four-cylinder engine does have room for improvement.\n\nOne thing’s for sure with this redesign: Lexus didn’t totally abandon the qualities that many Lexus faithful appreciate. The automaker predicts a third of 2023 RX buyers will be RX loyalists, while 43% are predicted to come from competing brands. Regardless, the sweet spot for all shoppers may be the RX 350h hybrid.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Lexus RX: 6 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nIs the 2022 Lexus GX 460 a Good SUV?

      "expert_review": "Following the SUV’s significant overhaul for the 2023 model year, the Lexus RX largely carries over for 2024 with only minimal color and trim changes. The biggest news is the addition of a plug-in hybrid variant, known as the RX 450h+. Lexus has released full pricing of the luxury SUV, which is the brand’s bestselling model so far in 2023, and the 2024 RX has a starting price of $49,950 (all prices include a $1,350 destination fee).\n\nRelated: 2024 Lexus RX 450h+: The RX Finally Plugs In\n\nLuxury Plugged In\n\nNew for 2024 is the 450h+ variant, which resides at the top of the RX family tree and is equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to two electric motors and standard all-wheel drive. Combined output is 304 horsepower and, according to Lexus, the PHEV needs 6.2 seconds to accelerate from 0-60 mph.\n\nThe RX 450h+’s 35 miles of electric range is competitive with its rivals, and according to Lexus, it gets a combined rating of 83 mpg-equivalent. With a 6.6-kilowatt onboard charger, the brand also says that the SUV can be recharged in approximately 2.5 hours at 240 volts. For comparison, the 2023 BMW X5 xDrive45e has a 31-mile electric-only range and returns an EPA-estimated 50 mpg-e rating.\n\nThe RX 450h+ is notably equipped in the upscale Luxury trim, which adds features such as a head-up instrument display, navigation, leather seating surfaces, 14-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 21-inch alloy wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, panoramic sunroof and ambient cabin lighting.\n\nPowertrain Specs\n\nOnce again, a total of six trims are available: Standard, Premium, Premium+, Luxury, F Sport Handling and F Sport Performance.\n\nThe standard powertrain in the RX 350 consists of a 275-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Moving up to the RX 350 F Sport Handling adds standard AWD, racier exterior and interior styling details, and an adaptive suspension.\n\nNext is the RX 350h, a hybrid model that combines a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, two electric motors, a continuously variable automatic and AWD. Total output is 246 hp, and it returns an EPA-estimated 36 mpg combined.\n\nAs the former range-topping version of the RX, the RX 500h F Sport Performance features a 366-hp powertrain consisting of a 2.4-liter turbo-four, two electric motors, AWD and a six-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nLexus says the 2024 RX lineup will be available by the end of 2023, and AWD adds $1,600 to the RX 350. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nRX 350: $49,950\nRX 350h: $51,800\nRX 500h: $63,800\nRX 450h+: $70,080\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Lexus RX Lineup Priced to Pair With Redesign\n2023 Lexus RX Review: Still a Comfort Option?\n2023 Lexus RX Sports New Platform, Powertrains, Performance Variant\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\nThese Are the Most Dependable 3-Year-Old Cars, Says J.D.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe gold standard for unassuming luxury SUVs, the five-seat RX is a cornerstone of Lexus’ hybrid efforts and the brand’s runaway bestseller, accounting for more than a third of Lexus vehicles sold in the U.S.\n\nBuyers can choose from four powertrains in the RX. The base RX 350 uses a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 275 horsepower; it’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The RX 350h hybrid gets a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors for a total output of 246 hp; it has a continuously variable automatic transmission and standard AWD. The RX 450h+ plug-in hybrid pairs the 2.5-liter engine and CVT with two stronger motors for a total of 304 hp, and it can travel up to an EPA-rated 37 miles on electricity alone. (It exceeded that range estimate in our own test.) The most athletic RX is the RX 500h hybrid, which comes with a sport-tuned AWD system and six-speed automatic transmission. It combines the turbocharged 2.4-liter with a pair of motors to generate 366 hp. The RX’s rivals include the BMW X5, Cadillac XT5, Genesis GV80 and Lincoln Nautilus.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe RX was redesigned for the 2023 model year and gained its RX 450h+ trim for 2024. It sees minor changes for 2025, including a standard 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a limited-production Black Line Special Edition version of the RX 500h and an F Sport Design trim level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED exterior lighting\nKeyless entry and start\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\n9.8-inch infotainment touchscreen \nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport-tuned F Sport suspension\nMoonroof\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDriver’s seat memory settings\nPerforated leather upholstery\n14-inch infotainment touchscreen\n21-speaker Mark Levinson audio system\nHead-up display\nWireless charging pad\nAutomated parking assist \nTraffic jam assist\nParking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lexus RX?\n\nThe Lexus RX is a solid value, similar in size to vehicles like the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE, but priced against the smaller X3 and GLC. Lexus isn’t hitting that price by skimping on standard features, either, as the base RX comes well equipped. The RX is quiet and comfortable, and the hybrid 350h and PHEV 450h+ both deliver fuel economy in the mid-30-mpg range in combined city/highway driving. Shoppers interested in something fun to drive will want to look elsewhere, though; even the RX 500h isn’t particularly invigorating compared with similarly powerful class rivals.",
