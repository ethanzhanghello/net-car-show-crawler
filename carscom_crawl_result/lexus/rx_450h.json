      "expert_review": "There’s no denying the charms of Lexus’ redesigned RX crossover. It’s extremely comfortable; it packs a sophisticated, upscale interior; and, in the hybrid version, it returns the mileage of a midsize sedan — a four-cylinder one.\n\nWith all that going for it, the RX 450h hybrid has one fatal flaw: It drives like a hybrid from five years ago before most companies had worked out the odd kinks of the fuel-efficient cars, like spotty braking and herky-jerky acceleration. Aside from that, the RX is a sublime crossover.\n\nPerformance\nEvery good mark the RX line up earns in other areas is discredited by the hybrid’s performance attributes. To get such excellent mileage, the V-6 engine is teamed with an electric motor and a large battery pack, along with regenerative brakes that send brake force to recharge the battery. This is one of the main reasons hybrids get such great mileage.\n\nThe RX’s brakes, however, are horrendous. Just as in the first hybrid I ever tested, the RX’s brakes engage when you push down on the pedal, then release briefly and engage again. It’s a disconcerting feeling that likely hampered hybrid sales when they were first introduced. Oddly enough, Toyota’s redesigned Prius has excellent brakes, with none of the hesitation that the RX displays. Those engineers clearly didn’t work on the RX’s brakes.\n\nThe acceleration is just as stilted. When you tap the gas pedal, the engine — which often shuts off at idle — kicks on with a lurch before there’s any get-up-and-go. Again, this is a hybrid trait of the past. The new 2010 Prius and Ford Fusion Hybrid don’t act this way. In all other performance metrics you’ll experience on a daily drive, from highway passing to steering feel, the front-wheel-drive RX I tested is acceptable — if not good — for its class. There’s little to no engine noise, even when the gas engine is running full tilt.\n\nThe suspension is slightly on the cushy side, but luxury buyers expect such comfort. I never expected a sportier driving experience in a Lexus crossover.\n\nOne bonus of Toyota’s hybrid system in the RX is the ability to drive in electric-only mode up to 25 mph. This is a great thing to use in bumper-to-bumper commutes, as I recently discovered in the Prius. I engaged the RX’s electric mode on my morning commute, and it lasted nearly 2 miles before running through the battery charge. The Prius topped out at 2.4 miles before it switched to gas power on my morning commute. However, I was only able to use the EV mode twice during my week-long test drive, with the car always citing not enough charge to switch over. The Prius’ EV mode at least turned on during every drive I took, even if it didn’t always manage 2.4 miles.\n\nI averaged 26.6 mpg during my test, which involved four days of my daily 50-mile round-trip drive to work in very heavy traffic, which should boost mileage in a hybrid vehicle. That bests a four-cylinder Toyota Camry’s 26 mpg combined, but the EPA rates the front-wheel-drive RX I tested at 32/28 mpg city/highway and 30 mpg combined. Since I rarely used the air conditioning and temperatures were mild, in the 50- to 60-degree range, I was a bit unimpressed with the RX’s real-world results. Still, most crossovers this size barely break the 20 mpg combined figure. The standard RX 350 rates just 21 mpg combined.\n\nAn all-wheel-drive version of the RX 450h is available. It gets 30/28 mpg city/highway and 29 mpg combined.\n\nExterior\nThe new RX is clearly an evolution of the past generation’s design, not a groundbreaking new look. That’s OK, because the previous generation is the benchmark for the class; competing automakers tell us that directly, which is a compliment. The previous RX sold extremely well, and the new one is also selling well. That’s why the new design, while slightly more aggressive up front, remains nondescript everywhere else, which shouldn’t turn off any buyers.\n\nThe biggest change comes to the grille, which has an interesting vertical swoop at the bottom and, as far as I could tell, was actually made of metal — a rarity in today’s plastic, fake-chrome world.\n\nInterior\nWhere the RX really shines is in the cabin. The base RX 350 has a terrifically upscale interior for $37,250. Even at the hybrid’s starting price of $42,110, it seems lush and well worth the money. The leather is rich and soft — like a really nice couch, not a luxury car. The driver’s seat is especially comfortable, with plenty of thigh support and a wide back. Some luxury cars have seats that are overly stiff, but not the RX.\n\nFrom that cushy perch, your eyes glance over the dash and its scoop-like center control cluster with the shifter directly below. It’s an odd place for a shifter, but I got used to it during my test. There’s no escaping, however, the fact that the buttons directly above it are hard to reach. They’re also quite small.\n\nTo control most of the advanced features, like navigation with voice commands (available in a $2,465 option package) you have to use a computer mouse-like controller that Lexus calls Remote Touch. It works almost exactly like a computer’s mouse and is located right below the shifter. It’s comfortable to put your hand around and easy to move the arrow on the center-mounted LCD screen, but most commands don’t require such precise cursor placement. A simple clickwheel like you find in Mercedes and Audi cars would be preferable. Because it reminded me so much of a mouse, it also kind of reminded me of the cubicle I spend my days in … while I was driving. That wasn’t a good mindset to be in.\n\nI didn’t like the heated and cooled seat controls hidden under the sliding armrest/center console cover. If you left one on you wouldn’t be able to shut it off — or even see what setting it was on — if you or a passenger slid the armrest up.\n\nThe backseat is spacious, and I easily fit both an infant and convertible child-safety seat back there using the Latch anchors. Legroom for adults is beyond plentiful, as is headroom.\n\nFeatures\nWhile the RX 450h is reasonably priced to start at $42,110, adding options quickly ratchets up the sticker price. Items you might find standard on other cars in this class, like those heated and cooled seats, are an additional $640 (or $825 in a package along with rain-sensing wipers). To get a power moonroof, you need to add a $2,400 Premium Package, which also adds heated outside mirrors, a power hatch, a USB adapter, and memory settings for the driver’s seat and steering wheel. Add in my test vehicle’s navigation system ($2,465), a surround-sound audio system ($1,610), and LED headlights ($1,825), and the sticker was $52,110.\n\nAs a music fan who took the RX on a long commute, I was not impressed by the audio system. The sound was crisp, but it had no low end or midrange; it made even the most laid-back rock ‘n’ roll sound shrill. The navigation and entertainment settings, accessed using Remote Touch, were a pain to use.\n\nCargo\nOne winning attribute for the RX is its spacious cargo area. At 40 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 80.3 cubic feet with them folded, you’ll be hard-pressed to find another two-row crossover — or perhaps even a three-row crossover — that tops it. Audi likes to compare its new Q5 crossover with the RX, but the Q5 packs just 29.1 cubic feet in back. The redesigned Cadillac SRX has 29.8/61.1 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nPacked with 10 airbags and the requisite safety features found in luxury cars these days, the 2010 RX was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2009. For 2010, those ratings will include a roof-strength test, which the RX has not yet undergone. The RX should, however, meet most car shoppers’ safety thresholds.\n\nAdditional options — like a pre-collision warning system and a subscription service that contacts roadside assistance for tire changes and emergency responders for crashes — are peace-of-mind features we like to see in this class. The pre-collision warning system detects when traffic ahead is stopped or moving too slowly and sounds an alert in the cabin, and it initiates braking when needed. It’s part of a $1,500 option package that also comes with speed-sensitive cruise control that adjusts your speed to match traffic in front of you.\n\nRX 450h in the Market\nI’ve personally never understood car shoppers’ desire to get a hybrid version of a luxury car or SUV, even if the mileage gains are significant, as they are in the RX; these buyers can afford more expensive gas if (when) prices spike. If the hybrid is also a pleasure to drive, it makes much more sense. An example of that is Lexus’ own LS 600h sedan. When the driving experience is crippled by the hybrid system, as it is in the RX, there’s no reason to buy. That’s unfortunate, because the RX 350 is terrific and decently priced for what you get.\n\nAdding the cost of the hybrid system to the cost of your daily driving happiness — even minus the huge mileage savings — is a tough equation for a car shopper to work through. There’s no crossover — nor is there any SUV or minivan — that offers so much room with such great gas mileage, luxury badge or not. Even a four-cylinder Toyota Venza requires more stops at the pump.\n\nGreen drivers who can stomach the driving tradeoffs are the buyers who will gravitate to the RX 450h. I don’t suspect anyone else will, but in today’s increasingly eco-conscious world that might not be such a small group.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLexus redesigned its five-seat RX crossover for 2010, with the gasoline RX 350 carrying over a similar V-6 drivetrain. Because its electrically assisted V-6 grew to 3.5 liters from 3.3 liters, the RX 400h became the RX 450h. Slight exterior tweaks differentiate the RX 450h from its non-hybrid sibling.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional. The non-hybrid RX 350 is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for the 2012 model year.\n\nExterior\nThough it’s a few hairs taller than its predecessor, the RX 450h looks more carlike than ever; its dimensions give the crossover a wagonlike stance. In back are frosted taillight effects similar to those on the previous RX. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 19-inchers optional. Exterior features include:\n\n\nBlue-trimmed Lexus logos\nUnique grille and front bumper design\nBlue-tinted headlights and taillights\nOptional LED headlights\n\n\nInterior\nLike Lexus’ other hybrids, the RX 450h’s display screen can show the power flow between the drivetrain’s electric motors, engine and battery. In place of the RX 350’s tachometer is a gauge showing electric-motor assist versus battery recharging. Other features include voice-recognition software that Lexus says will pick up conversational prompts rather than traditional formal, specific commands.\n\nHigh-tech options include a head-up display with LED lighting that’s purportedly bright enough to read on a sunny day. The optional navigation system features Lexus’ Remote Touch interface, which uses a joystick-like device to navigate menus on the dashboard screen. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth seats standard, leather optional\nReal wood trim\n10-way power front seats\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe RX 450h uses a gasoline 3.5-liter V-6 that’s assisted by electric motors, creating 295 combined horsepower. It can cruise on electric-only power at low speeds. Like other hybrids, its electric motors draw power from the friction of deceleration, called regenerative braking. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard front-wheel drive\nOptional all-wheel drive\nSeparate motors power front and rear wheels in all-wheel-drive models\nContinuously variable automatic transmission\nTowing capacity of 3,500 pounds with optional package\n\n\nSafety\nTen standard airbags include four in front — the two required chest airbags plus two knee airbags — as well as seat-mounted side-impact airbags for both rows. Head-protecting side curtain airbags cover both rows. Other standard safety features include:\n\n\nActive front head restraints\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Think of the 2013 Lexus RX 450h as the ideal vehicle to carry you along the path to spiritual enlightenment: It is supremely quiet, enshrouds you in the comfort and safety, and moves you forward without feeling the need to compete with anyone else on the road.\n\nOf course, to get all of this you have to pay a small premium, but silence is golden — particularly if you’re a parent of small children — and the promise of enlightenment is too tempting to forego.\n\nThe “h” stands for hybrid and 2013 RX 450h runs about $6,600 more than the non-hybrid RX models. You’d spend that much going to an ashram in India, and driving this car is like an everyday mini-retreat.\n\nIf you demand driving excitement, the RX 450h is not for you. It glides along the street; there’s no burly acceleration, just an easygoing build-up to higher speeds. However, don’t be fooled into thinking it’s not powerful. The RX 450h makes a combined 295 horsepower that ensures it easily gets over the highest peaks.\n\nThe RX is a midsize crossover that’s not ideal for larger families like mine, but if you have two children or fewer there is plenty to recommend it. It’s been refreshed for 2013, with updates to the grille and rear taillights as well as a few new exterior paint color options. A power liftgate and a USB input are now standard.\n\nThe 2013 Lexus RX 450h with front-wheel drive has a starting price of $47,205, including an $895 destination charge. Choosing all-wheel drive adds $1,400. My all-wheel-drive test car with a DVD entertainment system, navigation, blind spot warning and an upgraded stereo cost $64,339.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 RX 450h features Lexus’ new horizontal grille. A rear spoiler as well as all-new headlights, daytime running lights and taillights complete the crossover’s sleek look. Overall, the car’s exterior has a demure quality that allows you to slide in and out of traffic, parking spots and the many roles you play with ease.\n\nThe doors and step-in height were all manageable for my kindergartener. Younger ones will need some help, but you’re so blissed out in this crossover that you don’t mind doing it.\n\nThe cargo area is sizable with 40.0 cubic feet of space behind the backseat. The rear seats are split 40/20/40 and fold to create 80.3 cubic feet of space.\n\nThe RX 450h has a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired to electric motors and a high-voltage battery to provide 295 hp. On all-wheel-drive models, like the one I tested, there’s an additional electric motor to power the rear wheels. The all-wheel-drive RX 450h gets an EPA-estimated 30/28 mpg city/highway; the front-wheel-drive version gets 32/28 mpg. It runs on premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nAs any guru will teach you, interior comfort is paramount to the pursuit of enlightenment. Thankfully, the RX450h provides plenty of it. The center console, steering wheel and interior trim and accents have all been refreshed for 2013. Everything looks and feels soothing.\n\nOne fun new feature is the ambient blue lighting around the gauges whenever you’re driving efficiently. It’s understated but especially fun for nighttime drives and subtly challenges you to drive with greater consciousness.\n\nMy test car’s rich, cognac-colored leather seats are part of the Luxury Package ($6,135). There’s plenty of support in all seating positions, and with the 10-way power adjustable front seats and sliding and reclining rear seats, it’s easy to make room for the people you’ll tote around on a daily basis.\n\nStorage is a mixed bag. There are five cupholders plus four bottleholders, a glove box and center console that don’t fit larger items, and a small fold-down storage bin in the middle of the rear seats. There is also a storage area under the center stack that can’t fit a large purse but can hold some DVDs and a small bag of bite-size cupcakes (essential to my children’s Friday afternoon enlightenment).\n\nThe available DVD entertainment system has dual screens that can display different shows, giving you the omnipotence to calm the warring factions in the crossover’s rear seats. However, like many entertainment systems, it’s controlled predominantly by a remote control. This is great for older kids, but for younger ones like mine, the onus of operation falls to the driver (me) and that’s tough. It eventually involved pulling over. The multimedia system, however, is controlled more easily with a mouse that allows you to navigate the various screens. It’s also worth noting that for a high-tech system, the center stack is refreshingly uncomplicated.\n\nWhile this car has all the trappings of a peaceful, luxurious family car, it is not a viable everyday car for a family like mine with three small kids. Fitting three child-safety seats across the backseat was a stretch, and we had to forego some things (like my husband’s skis) for a weekend trip to the snowy mountains due to limited space. If we had one less child, we could have put the 40/20/40-split seats to use, folding the middle section down and fitting my hubby’s skis in the RX. Alas, we couldn’t decide which child to leave on the side of the road so we left the skis instead.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 RX 450h with all-wheel drive has earned an overall safety score of five stars and the front-wheel-drive version received four stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard rear seats, and they’re relatively easy to access, though not a breeze to use with the somewhat stiff leather upholstery. Three top tether hooks sit at the midway point of the rear seatbacks, but don’t let that fool you into thinking you can fit three car seats. Read Cars.com’s Car Seat Check to find out how the RX deals with child-safety seats.\n\nStandard features are front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control, active front head restraints and 10 airbags, including knee airbags and side-impact airbags for the front and rear outboard seats. As if that weren’t enough, you get a free year of Lexus Safety Connect, which alerts the authorities in the event of a serious collision and puts you in touch with a 24/7 response center at the touch of a button.\n\nOptional features are all-wheel drive, auto leveling xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a blind spot warning, lane departure warning, precollision warning system, adaptive cruise control and front and rear parking sensors. There’s also an optional head-up display, which projects driver information onto the windshield thereby keeping your eyes on the road.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Lexus RX 450h.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nThe Lexus RX mid-size luxury SUV is available in gas RX 350 or hybrid RX 450h form. There’s also a performance-oriented F Sport model and extended three-row L versions. All use a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and the RX 450h adds electric motors. The RX 350 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, and the RX 450h is all-wheel-drive only with an electric motor driving the rear wheels. Competitors include the Cadillac XT5 , Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nThe RX’s remote function adds smart watch and Amazon Alexa device compatibility.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard Lexus Safety System Plus includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. The RX 450h’s fuel-saving hybrid drivetrain achieves 30 mpg combined in EPA testing.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus RX?\n\nOften credited with creating the luxury crossover SUV class, the Lexus RX continues to please buyers looking for refinement. However, our editors find it less engaging to drive than some competitors and are continually frustrated with its optional Remote Touch multimedia interface.  The cramped third-row seat in extended L versions is of dubious usefulness, too.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLexus redesigned its five-seat RX crossover for 2010, with the gasoline RX 350 carrying over a similar V-6 drivetrain. Because its electrically assisted V-6 grew to 3.5 liters from 3.3 liters, the RX 400h became the RX 450h. Slight exterior tweaks differentiate the RX 450h from its non-hybrid sibling.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional. The non-hybrid RX 350 is covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nWhat’s New for 2011\nChanges are minimal for this model year. A 12-volt outlet has moved from inside the center console to outside for easier access, and models with the optional navigation system lose the compass from the inside mirror because the nav system has its own compass. The Sport Package is no longer offered. The RX 350 adds a brake override system for 2011, but that feature was already standard on the RX 450h.\n\nExterior\nThough it’s a few hairs taller than its predecessor, the RX 450h looks more carlike than ever; its dimensions, now also wider and longer, give the crossover a wagonlike stance. In back are frosted taillight effects similar to those on the previous RX. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 19-inchers optional. Exterior features include:\n\nBlue-trimmed Lexus logos\nUnique grille and front bumper design\nBlue-tinted headlights and taillights\nOptional LED headlights\n\nInterior\nLike Lexus’ other hybrids, the RX 450h’s display screen can show the power flow between the drivetrain’s electric motors, engine and battery. In place of the RX 350’s tachometer is a gauge showing electric-motor assist versus battery recharging. Other features include voice-recognition software that Lexus says will pick up conversational prompts rather than traditional formal, specific commands. High-tech options include a head-up display with LED lighting that’s purportedly bright enough to read on a sunny day. The interior also features Lexus’ Remote Touch system, which uses a knob to navigate menus on the dashboard display screen. Interior features include:\n\nCloth seats standard, leather optional\nReal wood interior trim\n10-way power front seats\nThird-row seat not offered\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe RX 450h uses a gasoline 3.5-liter V-6 that’s assisted by electric motors, creating up to 295 combined horsepower and estimated city gas mileage of 30-32 mpg. It can cruise on electric-only power at low speeds. Like other hybrids, its electric motors draw power from the friction of deceleration, called regenerative braking. Mechanical features include:\n\nStandard front-wheel drive\nOptional all-wheel drive\nSeparate motors power front and rear wheels in all-wheel-drive models\nContinuously variable automatic transmission\nPremium fuel recommended\nTowing capacity of 3,500 pounds with optional package\n\nSafety\nTen standard airbags include four in front — the two required chest airbags plus two knee airbags — as well as seat-mounted side airbags for the first and second rows. Head-protecting side curtain airbags span both rows. Other standard safety features include:\n\nActive front head restraints\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control",

      "expert_review": "Wild styling draws attention to the 2016 Lexus RX 350, but uninspired handling, lackluster brake feel and a lack of innovative features won’t win it many new friends.\n\nSince its introduction in 1998, the Lexus RX midsize luxury SUV has been a hit. It’s one of the few luxury vehicles of any type that regularly sells more than 100,000 units a year in the U.S. It’s been a boon for the Lexus brand. But Lexus has always played it safe with the RX, with styling that was warm but never hot and driving dynamics that were pleasing but never entertaining.\n\nThe new 2016 RX 350 and RX 450h hybrid are the latest attempts to inject some youthful exuberance into the Lexus lexicon, but with many changes that don’t go much more than skin-deep, has Lexus gone far enough to attract new buyers?\n\nExterior & Styling\nTo paraphrase style maven Tim Gunn, the 2016 Lexus RX has a whole lot of look. From the pointed, gaping, spindle-shaped grille up front to the hash work of character lines down the side and a floating roof element that is dangerously close to becoming the latest styling element that every automaker incorporates, the new RX is highly distinctive. And yet, it works.\n\nThis may be the first instance of Lexus’ dramatic new styling coming together cohesively in an appealing manner. The new RX looks modern and distinctive, and the proportions are well-suited to the look. It’s a little bit longer and marginally wider, mostly to give backseat passengers more legroom, but the RX looks good from any angle.\n\nLED headlights and taillights can be had, and even an upgraded premium tri-lens package light can be optioned, which features LED cornering lights and rear turn signals. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard, but 20-inch wheels are optional, an inch larger than the 2015 unit offered. They fill out the wheel wells nicely and add to the RX’s high-tech look.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe RX comes in four flavors: the base RX 350, the RX 350 F Sport, the RX 450h hybrid and new for 2016, an RX 450h F Sport. The base model’s 3.5-liter V-6 is basically unchanged from 2015 aside from a modest 25-horsepower bump. The eight-speed automatic that was only available on the 2015 RX 350 F Sport is now standard on the RX 350 too. The result is an acceptably quick SUV that delivers thrust in a smooth flow, with shifts that are unobtrusive and practically seamless.\n\nThe transmission does hunt a bit during spirited driving, but with eight speeds to play with, that’s to be expected. The result of that hunting is a vehicle that’s always ready with power when you need it; the powertrain, in fact, is the best part of the RX experience.\n\nIf you’d rather pay a little more money for better fuel economy, the RX 450h hybrid isn’t a bad way to do it, with just as much power on tap when you need it, but the added benefit of limited EV operation when you don’t. It makes a total of 308 system hp from a combination of the V-6 and electric motors. The hybrid still uses a heavy nickel-metal-hydride battery instead of a lighter, more power-dense lithium-ion one, but it’s been repackaged so it no longer intrudes into the cargo or rear passenger space.\n\nFrom a powertrain standpoint, there isn’t much of a downside to opting for the hybrid. Throttle response is delayed a bit as it passes through an initial EV mode before employing the gasoline engine, but the hybrid performs remarkably similarly to the gas-only model. It’s worlds better than the outgoing RX hybrid.\n\nThe rest of the RX 350 is less entertaining.\n\nIts steering is nicely balanced, but it feels slow to react. In normal driving through parking lots and interstate roads, it won’t be an issue, but when trying to negotiate switchbacks or mountain twisties, it becomes more apparent. The RX 350 is prone to understeer in both front- and all-wheel-drive versions, with pronounced body roll that makes the heavy SUV push through corners instead of slice neatly through them.\n\nIt is not nearly as athletic as a BMW X5 or Audi Q5, but its heft and damping give it a solidity and stability that is lacking from vehicles like the Cadillac SRX. The brakes are unimpressive, providing little feedback. Using them almost feels like you’ve pushed a “brakes button” instead of a pedal — they’re working, but it doesn’t feel like there’s much mechanical action happening underfoot; the RX’s mass once again is acutely felt.\n\nBoth the RX 350 and RX 450h can be had with an F Sport trim aimed at changing the driving experience to something more appealing to German-luxury buyers. The F Sport trim doesn’t get any more power; its mechanical changes are limited to firmer suspension tuning, a special transmission shift program and less power-steering assist, for better feedback. There are also some added appearance items inside and out.\n\nRequired steering effort goes up noticeably in F Sport versions. If you use the multimode selector dial to switch into Sport S or Sport S+ modes, it goes up even more dramatically. Transmission and accelerator responsiveness also get much more aggressive, and the adaptive suspension that’s unique to the F Sport stiffens the ride considerably. Unfortunately, none of this translates into a more capable vehicle. It’s still just as heavy as the base model and features significant understeer and body roll.\n\nIt may feel sportier, but the F Sport’s changes don’t improve the RX’s abilities. I would opt for a base RX 350 over the F Sport and its more heavily bolstered sport seats (which are too small, too firm and too rigidly bolstered) and less informative gauge package. The more affordable version is much more pleasant to drive, more comfortable and quieter to boot.\n\nFuel economy is above average for both RX models. The RX 350 is estimated to achieve 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. The 450h is a bit better, with an estimated 31/30/30 mpg in front-drive models and 30/28/30 mpg with all-wheel drive. Most of the benefit comes in city driving thanks to the hybrid’s gas-saving low-speed EV mode.\n\nIn comparison, the Acura MDX gets nearly identical numbers, with 20/27/23 mpg and 19/26/22 mpg with front- and all-wheel drive, respectively. Cadillac’s SRX gets a much worse 17/24/19 mpg and 16/23/18 mpg. The larger Infiniti QX60 isn’t quite as powerful but manages 21/27/23 mpg with front-wheel and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive, thanks to its continuously variable automatic transmission. The hybrid QX60 has been discontinued for 2016.\n\nInterior\nInside, the RX gets a makeover with more luxurious materials and better trim and color options. Four colors of leather are available (including dark red, exclusive to the F Sport), as are five trim materials, four of which are real wood veneer in some lovely patterns. The standard 10-way power-adjustable front seats can be upgraded with the optional Luxury Package. With it, they come wrapped in semi-aniline leather and have power lower cushion lengtheners, making these the most comfortable seats in the whole lineup.\n\nIt’s comparable to the quality of an Acura MDX inside, and nicer than a Cadillac SRX or Infiniti QX60. The RX does, however, still trail the German luxury cars in terms of sophistication and feel.\n\nBackseat room is decent, with more legroom than before thanks to a longer wheelbase. Headroom is plentiful, front and rear. All the surfaces you’re likely to touch with either hands or elbows have a premium look and feel, aside from the buttons and switches, which look like they could easily have come from a high-end Toyota-brand model. On the upside, the buttons are mechanical rather than touch-sensitive panels.\n\nOutward visibility is pretty good, with the exception of the rear three-quarters view. Those funky pillars in the cargo area inhibit the view out back, but every other direction offers plenty of open views.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe gauges in base models are clear and easy to read, but the F Sport’s Lexus LFA-inspired gauges are less useful at a glance. The optional premium Mark Levinson audio system is fantastic, but even the mid-grade 12-speaker non-branded system is impressive.\n\nMuch less impressive is the RX’s multimedia system that produces the music as well as navigation and other tech. It doesn’t feature the maddening trackpad like the smaller NX, but it still has a joystick and selector buttons on the console by your hand. Imagine driving down the road while using a laptop computer, with the display screen sitting on the dash and your wireless mouse in your lap, as you try to identify icons on the screen and navigate the cursor to them to select them. This is essentially what Lexus is having drivers do with the RX’s Remote Touch Interface system, and it’s horrible.\n\nThe company is long overdue for rethinking how it approaches its multimedia system, and given that neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are even planned for the RX, it seems the whole multimedia strategy needs a redo if the brand wants to attract younger buyers.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe RX 350 features 18.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, expandable to 56.3 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. The seats do not fold perfectly flat, but it’s close enough as to not matter.\n\nThese numbers, however, are a bit misleading, as they differ considerably from the 2015 model. The 2015 RX 350 had a stated 40.0 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, expandable to 80.3 cubic feet, and the space this year is about the same. We chalk up this model’s smaller numbers to a difference in how Lexus is now measuring cargo space (see an explanation of the problems with measuring cargo space here). The Cadillac SRX has 29.8 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 61.1 cubic feet. Both the MDX and QX60 have third-row seating, expanding their usable passenger area. The MDX features 15.0 cubic feet behind the third row, opening to 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 68.4 cubic feet with all rows stowed. The QX60 is similarly sized, with 15.8 cubic feet behind its third row, 40.8 behind the second and a total cargo volume of 76.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 RX 350 and 450h have not yet been crash-tested.\n\nLexus has bundled many of the RX’s safety features into a new package, called Lexus Safety System Plus. It combines radar-based cruise control, lane keep assist, automatic high-beam headlights, pre-crash preparation with pedestrian detection, autonomous braking and a few other features into a single high-value package.\n\nWhile the distance-keeping cruise control with automatic stop-and-go worked well, the lane keep assist feature is overly sensitive, vibrating the steering wheel and nudging you back into your lane if you even approach the center line, much less actually cross it. After a couple miles of being forced to meticulously maintain the center of my lane lest my steering wheel continue to vibrate, I switched the feature off. See all the RX 350’s standard safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOverall, legions of happy buyers of the previous three generations of RX SUVs will be perfectly pleased with the new fourth-generation model. If you don’t ask too much of it in terms of spirited driving, it will deliver a quiet, comfortable commute.\n\nPricing for the new RX was not yet available at publication time, but is not expected to change much from previous years.\n\nCompetitors are numerous and varied in their styles, with the big choice seemingly coming in configuration (front- or rear-wheel drive) and interior capacity (two rows or three). The Acura MDX is the competitor most often considered: it’s priced nearly identically, based off a car platform, and has a V-6 and front-wheel drive. It’s a bit bigger than the RX, though, offering three-row seating.\n\nThe same can be said for the Infiniti QX60, which is based on the Nissan Pathfinder and has specs nearly identical to those of the MDX. The Cadillac SRX is a bit smaller than the RX 350 and decidedly older, but it’s also a five-seat model and features V-6 power and front-wheel drive. It is, however, due to be replaced in 2016 by the heavily revised and larger Cadillac XT5.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Up until the 2020 Lexus RX, every modern Lexus came with an annoying asterisk: Yes, it was a fine vehicle, but the touchpad or mouselike multimedia controls were so confounding and frustrating that it eventually made you think Luddites had it pretty good. So what’s changed for 2020? The updated 2020 Lexus RX ditches the mouse and adds a touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, addressing one (or is it several?) of the luxury SUV’s weakest areas.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX and RXL Preview: Rejuvenating an Aging Icon\n\nThe 2020 Lexus RX isn’t without its quirks; the asterisk is just a little smaller. The touchscreen and tech enhancements are the most significant changes for 2020, though a bunch of little things — new smartphone holder, over-the-air updates, expanded F-Sport line — have similar executions: They sound great on paper but are a little less impressive in practice. The bulk of the RX is unchanged, available in five-seat RX 350 and hybrid RX 450h variants, along with an L version of each that includes a small third row for a total of six or seven seats.\n\nBring on the Touchscreen!\n\nWe all gasped when we heard Lexus was getting a touchscreen — actually, it was a sigh of relief — because the way the previous Lexus RX controlled the non-touch display distracted drivers, requiring them to use the mouse to select a little button. No longer, as the 2020 RX gets a standard 8-inch touchscreen or the optional, vibrant 12.3-inch touchscreen I sampled. Lexus moved the screen 5 inches closer to the driver for 2020, though that might not be enough. I’m 6 feet tall with long arms and like to sit fairly close to the wheel, so I didn’t have a problem using the screen while driving, but the touchscreen might prove too far to be useful if you have shorter arms and/or like to sit farther back; I had to fully extend my arm to reach the far end of the screen. Oddly, Lexus’ Remote Touchpad, seen in other models, snuck into the party when no one was looking, but it’s relatively obsolete in this application because of the touchscreen, and I used it only for the menu button during my short drive. If you can’t reach the touchscreen, the touchpad is how you’ll have to control CarPlay/Android Auto; Godspeed, you poor short-armed bastard.\n\nMy preference is the RX’s widescreen format — a style also offered on the BMW X5 — versus the vertically oriented touchscreen in a Volvo XC90. I exclusively use Apple CarPlay while driving, and CarPlay fills the entire display on widescreens like the Lexus, versus on a Volvo where CarPlay is stuck in a little box on the bottom half of the screen, barely larger than the plus-sized phone providing the function. In the RX, all 12.3 inches show CarPlay, so the buttons are large and easy to press (if you can reach them), and annoyingly long podcast titles that would normally be cut off in a small screen are fully displayed.\n\nOver-the-Air Map Updates\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor those who don’t use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which provide navigation from a smartphone, the optional built-in navigation system is quite good and boosted for 2020 with more humanized voice recognition (it recognized numerous ways I asked to get to the nearest Starbucks). Most notable is that there are now over-the-air navigation updates that replace the need for a physical SD card. This isn’t the first Lexus to receive the system, named Dynamic Navigation, but it’s new to the RX. When maps are updated, the update comes straight into the RX via the onboard cellular connection. The functionality is active only if you subscribe to Lexus’ Enform cellular service, however, which comes with a free three-year trial before a subscription is required, and the updates are good only for navigation. Unlike the Tesla Model X, you won’t be getting vehicle functionality or systems updates. Those kinds of updates aren’t out of scope, however, as Lexus College senior product specialist Bob Gleich says there are numerous regulatory hoops Lexus must hop through first before that can happen.\n\nCellphone Holder — Brilliant Idea, So-So Execution\n\nLexus has an intriguing solution for storing phones, a center console cellphone pocket. The sizable slot was large enough to hold my iPhone Plus, which is impressive because my monster of a phone is wrapped in a toddler-proof thick, shock-resistant case. The holder stands the phone up vertically so it’s not using storage space in the cubby if laid down flat. Another bonus: The phone won’t fly out of a bin when accelerating like it does in some cars. On the downside, this cubby won’t wirelessly charge your phone, and CarPlay isn’t wireless as in some BMWs and Audis, so you’ll have to string a data/charge cable across the cupholders to the center console. Oddly, the USB ports literally right next to the phone holder are charge only, and not data ports that stream CarPlay/Android Auto and music to the media system like in the center console storage bin.\n\nDouble the F Sport\n\nThe sportier RX F Sport trim comes in two flavors for 2020, a regular F Sport with unique grille, tuned-up shock absorbers and fancy wheels, while an F Sport Performance is new, though I question the value in that package. The $4,850 F Sport Performance Package adds adaptive shocks with adjustable firmness similar to the Lexus LC 500 sports car, which is perhaps the one Lexus where its goofy controls can be glossed over because it’s that good. Lexus calls this adaptive variable suspension, but the RX with this heightened package remains one of the more buttery riding SUVs out there, even in the most aggressive Sport Plus mode that you don’t get on lesser RXs. The RX F Sport Performance Package remains perfectly comfortable for everyday use while giving you a shred of road feel you don’t get on the base suspension car (non-F Sport). When thrown into a corner, however, there aren’t the chops that would make you want to do it again, and the Sport Plus mode doesn’t do the engine and transmission any favors because it shifts conservatively, upshifting mid-corner and trying to get to the next gear as soon as possible. The paddle shifters work well here for maintaining a gear, but it’s not unique to the F Sport any longer because all RXs get steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual gear control, even the hybrid RX 450h.\n\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe F Sport Performance Package adds a sound tube for an extra bit of noise from under the hood, doing it mechanically versus electronic augmentation, according to Gleich, and you can hear a little extra muscly sound between 5,000 and 6,000 rpm, though only briefly. I haven’t driven the non-Performance-Package F Sport, but compared with the regular RX I drove, I don’t think you’ll be missing much if you skip the F Sport Performance Package.\n\nShould You Buy the 2019 or 2020 Lexus RX?\n2020 Lexus RX 350 F Sport | Cars.com Photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne new feature worth mentioning is the RX’s newly available kick-to-open tailgate, which like many of the 2020 additions normalizes the RX a tad more. Previously, you had to hold your hand over the Lexus badge to open it (doesn’t make much sense for a hands-free system), and now with a handful of groceries the rear power tailgate can be opened with a quick kick under the center of the bumper. In my testing, this worked five out of five times, an accomplishment for these types of systems that don’t always trigger when asked.\n\nIf you’ve deemed the RX’s size and price a good fit, then actively seek out the 2020 RX, which addresses one of the RX’s biggest shortcomings thanks to a more normalized control system and a host of new connectivity features.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Lexus RX 450h’s hybrid powertrain, quality interior and improved tech make it a solid fuel-efficient family-hauler, despite some minor blemishes.\n\nVersus the competition: A stylish interior and relatively new touchscreen help the RX 450h keep pace with other fashionable hybrid SUVs, and its added fuel efficiency and standard all-wheel drive make a case for it as the best Lexus RX on the market.\n\nLexus’ line of RX SUVs might not be the biggest or most capable on the automaker’s SUV roster, but it’s certainly the one that put the brand on the map — and the RX is its bestselling vehicle. And of that notable bunch, the hybrid RX 450h version might just be the best.\n\nThe big updates to the RX line happened in 2020, when Lexus didn’t exactly ditch its much-maligned center-console touchpad controller, but instead gave a choice of two touchscreen displays — measuring 8 or 12.3 inches — that let drivers control nearly everything via the display, not the confusing and distracting touchpad.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lexus RX Review: Just What the Doctor Ordered\n\nOur test vehicle featured the RX’s most significant update for the 2021 model year: a new special Black Line edition trim level that adds black exterior accents, including a horizontal black stripe above the rocker panels that’s reminiscent of Porsche’s GTS trims. The trim also brings 20-inch black wheels, a unique interior treatment and a set of matching Halliburton luggage. We didn’t get to play with the luggage set, but it didn’t cause an environmental disaster, so we’ll call it a win. Our test vehicle’s price came to $59,380 as-equipped, including a $1,025 destination fee.\n\nThe RX 450h competes against vehicles like the 2021 Volvo XC60 Recharge plug-in hybrid, the redesigned 2022 Acura MDX and its own sibling, the gas-powered RX 350.\n\nDriving\n\nThe 450h makes 308 total horsepower with a gasoline-powered V-6 that works with a set of three electric motor-generators and a nickel-metal-hydride battery pack. It’s not a remarkable figure, but it’s enough to get the SUV going briskly and provide ready passing power, even with a slightly hesitant continuously variable style of automatic transmission (the gas RX 350 gets a traditional automatic with eight gears). The only minor issue I had with the powertrain was a slightly unrefined droning noise.\n\nIn fact, the most remarkable thing about the RX 450h driving experience is how unremarkable it is. Besides a powertrain that never leaves you wanting for power, the steering feel is communicative for a mid-size SUV, and the suspension is just this side of firm. An optional F Sport handling package, which was not included on the vehicle we drove, adds an adaptive suspension and retunes the steering ratio. I suspect, though, that this would not make for a vastly different ride or handling experience. The latest iteration of Lexus’ F Sport packages, at least on the SUVs, seem to be mostly about appearances. If that’s the look you want, go for it (I actually prefer it, aesthetically), but if you don’t care for the looks of the F Sport package or are indifferent to them, save yourself the money.\n\nThe biggest surprise about driving the RX 450h is its braking — or rather, the fact that I didn’t find its brake pedal behavior annoying. Most vehicles in Toyota’s hybrid family have a spongy, nonlinear brake pedal feel that can take some getting used to — and lead to some tense moments in higher-speed braking (like when a traffic jam suddenly appears). The RX 450h’s brake pedal feel was more linear than I expected, almost like a non-hybrid car. We’d like more of that in your other hybrids, Toyota and Lexus.\n\nAlso worth noting: While testing the RX 450h in Chicago, we experienced a heavy snowfall, and the SUV struggled a bit in deeper, heavy, wet snow. That may be down to the efficiency-minded Bridgestone Ecopia tires it wore, which consumers rate 3.3 out of 10 points for winter/snow performance on Tirerack.com. Michelin Premier LTX tires, which are also listed as original equipment on this model and trim level, scored 7.1 in the same category. It’s a helpful reminder: AWD is not a free pass when it comes to traction in snow, and oftentimes the tires are the culprit.\n\nWe didn’t conduct an official fuel-economy test during our time with the RX 450h, but the EPA rates it a solid 31/28/30 mpg city/highway/combined. Compared with competitors, it significantly bests the 2021 RX 350 AWD’s 19/26/22 mpg and the 2022 MDX AWD’s 19/25/21 mpg. Its 30 mpg combined also tops the 2021 Volvo XC60 Recharge’s 27 mpg combined rating, though that vehicle is a plug-in hybrid with 19 miles of pure electric driving range when fully charged. The RX 450h continues a tradition of Toyota and Lexus hybrids offering an electric-only driving mode that functions at extremely low speeds for incredibly short periods, rendering it nearly pointless.\n\nInterior and Cargo\n\nDespite the presence of the dreaded touchpad controller (I’ll get to it in a second once I prepare myself), the interior of the RX 450h — and really any Lexus, in my book — is one of its strongest suits. The materials are high-quality, and the knobs and switches all feel first-rate. The test vehicle’s two-tone upholstery might not be for everyone, but it still feels nice.\n\nThe RX 450h’s interior is roomy enough for adults front and rear, and there’s so much headroom that adding the optional moonroof, which the RX we drove didn’t have, likely wouldn’t be a problem. Cargo space is also solid, with a Lexus-measured 16 cubic feet with the backseat in place and 32.6 cubic feet with it folded down. Those are identical measurements to the RX 350, so there’s no cargo space penalty when choosing the hybrid.\n\nThe touchpad controller, on the other hand … stinks. Its action is imprecise and requires a lot of attention, which really ought to be reserved for, oh, I don’t know, driving. I actually prefer the older joystick-based system, because with that one I could at least keep my eyes on the road more and have a better idea of where the cursor was going. But all that doesn’t really matter now that the display is a touchscreen. The only time my hand went deliberately toward the touchpad was to hit the Home button, which is located there, not on the display itself. Other than that, I never used it.\n\nThe display’s graphics are starting to look dated, and the menu structure isn’t the most user-friendly one out there, but for now I’m willing to give Lexus a pass because the system is finally at least usable. Another nit to pick, however, is that most functions on the 12.3-inch display use only about two-thirds of the screen, but that’s less a problem than a wasted opportunity. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa connectivity are all standard, regardless of screen size.\n\nSafety\n\nThe RX 450h comes standard with Lexus’ Safety System Plus 2.0, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with lane-keeping assist, lane-centering steering, forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and high-beam assist. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is newly standard for 2021 models. Our test vehicle also included an optional head-up display; it was helpful when it wasn’t being washed out by the polarized sunglasses I wore.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2021 Lexus RX, which includes both the gas-only 350 and hybrid 450h but not the three-row L versions, a Top Safety Pick for 2021, representing top scores for crashworthiness, crash prevention with other vehicles and a child seat anchor rating. It scored slightly lower for its headlight performance and crash prevention with pedestrians. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the 2021 RX 450h at four stars overall.\n\nShould You Buy an RX 450h?\n\nIf you’re deciding between an RX 350 and an RX 450h, the hybrid makes a very compelling case. It offers a similar driving experience, identical interior and significantly better fuel efficiency for a starting price just $1,250 higher than an AWD RX 350.\n\nIn terms of price and efficiency, the RX 450h also makes a strong case — at least on paper — compared with competition outside the Lexus family.\n\nUltimately, the RX 450h’s strongest argument is that it offers the benefits of a hybrid without most of the penalties and annoyances of the usual “unique” hybrid experience.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThe five-seat Lexus RX mid-size luxury SUV is available in gas RX 350 or hybrid RX 450h form. There’s also a performance-oriented F Sport model and a three-row L version that seats up to seven. All use a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, and the RX 450h adds electric motors.\n\nThe RX 350 is available with front- or all-wheel drive. The RX 450h is all-wheel-drive only, with an electric motor driving the rear wheels. Competitors include the Cadillac XT5, Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Lexus RX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather-trimmed interior\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\nNavigation with 12.3-inch touchscreen\nMark Levinson premium stereo\nRear automatic braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Lexus RX?\n\nOften credited with creating the luxury crossover SUV class, the Lexus RX continues to please buyers looking for refinement, but our editors find it less engaging to drive than some competitors. The Remote Touch multimedia interface remains frustrating, but the inclusion of a touchscreen makes it less of an issue than it was previously. The cramped third row in extended L versions is of dubious usefulness.",
