      "expert_review": "You are a builder of world-class sedans.\n\nYou are Lexus, upscale brand of Toyota, and you make them as well as anyone on the planet.\n\nBut now you want to offer a sports car. Not only to attract younger buyers, but also the older faithful who want a certain pizzazz of their own.\n\nThat calls for compromise. Jaguar bridged the gap by making available superchargers, and Mercedes-Benz did it with its great new line of SLKs. Porsche will go the other way — the company is planning a sedan it hopes to sell based on the aura of its sports cars.\n\nLexus first tinkered with the sports car concept in the early 1990s, but its early SC sport coupes were just OK. They were blown away by emerging cars from European and other Asian builders, and were also blinded by the glare of the great Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nSo what to say about today’s test car, the 2006 Lexus SC 430?\n\nThe company has almost accomplished its mission.\n\nGranted, if you are a Palm Springs matron or Manchester-by-the-Sea man of a certain age looking for that buzz without sacrificing luxurious amenities, have I got something for you.\n\nFirst, this is a brilliant car, and certain younger buyers whose wallets are fatter than their verve factor may well go for it.\n\nIt is hard to find this much luxury, power, quiet, and smoothness all together in a two-seater. (There is a back seat, but that’s where you park the toy poodle and your Gucci bag, not human beings.) And the trunk is useless if you want to travel top down and also carry luggage.\n\nThe SC 430 is pleasantly powerful, with a 4.3-liter V-8 engine that produces 288 horsepower and tough-tugging 317 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nYou can get Fifi to her shampoo appointment and back in world-class time in this baby.\n\nBut I fear I am being too cynical.\n\nIf what you are after is a sports car look — and the looks of this one are distinctive — with a luxurious ride, feel, and interior sense of entitlement, the SC 430 is hard to beat.\n\nConsider that even the little panels that open and close over its inner storage areas are made of wood. Knock (or touch) wood and it obeys like an electronic switch given a command.\n\nThe front seats are deep and enveloping. The interior includes such standard features as leather seats, adaptive headlights, a navigation system, a subtly booming nine-speaker sound system, wood trim galore, leather everywhere, and an aluminum-alloy roof that rises and drops in just over 20 seconds.\n\nFor safety, you get an antilock brake system, electronic brake force distribution (it handles emergency braking as soon as it senses that is where you are headed and beats you to it), front- and side-impact air bags, and traction/stability control.\n\nNew for 2006 is a six-speed automatic transmission with a sequential shifting option, meaning that you can truly be in charge of your shifts if you want to play race car driver. Unlike many other sequentials, it does not lurch forward with each upshift, but instead delivers feather-light gear changes. It also senses when you have downshifted on a hill and holds the lower gear (no need for braking), letting you wind the engine for full thrust when you want power for climbing, passing, or getting rapidly off corners.\n\nIt sounds like a sports car, and in many ways behaves like one.\n\nSo is it? Maybe it’s a sports car trimmed in mink.\n\nBut for the right person, in the right mood, and with the correct size wallet, the SC 430 is a perfect car.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "A lovely alternative\n\nLexus’ SC430 seems made for the female driver. But just what constitutes a ‘chick car,’ anyway?\n\nWhen I drive the Lexus SC430, I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and let’s just leave it at that, hmmm?\n\nThe SC430 — as polished as a manor house banister, as smooth as Napoleon brandy strained through Naomi Wolf’s silk stocking — is that mightily maligned thing: a chick car.\n\nThe term is a put-down, of course, with the same kind of derisive energy as the phrase “chick lit,” referring to female-centered fiction — tales of diva domesticity, cell-phone courtships and shoe-intensive anomie. Volvo recently rehabilitated the chick-car phrase, sort of, when it unveiled its YCC sport coupe at this year’s Geneva Auto Show. The YCC (Your Concept Car) was designed entirely by female Volvo employees and included features such as oversized rubber bumpers, automatic parking system, floral seat-cover and carpet sets, and rocker panels that rotated away as the doors opened to keep road grime from getting on dresses. Apparently, Volvo has more summer cotillions than other car companies.\n\nThe well-meant YCC illuminates one of the mysteries of cars and gender: car design that attempts to cater to women instead tends to patronize them as if they were deficient in some way. The YCC — whose perfect driver seems to be a parking-impaired debutante — is no more stereotype-sensitive than Chrysler’s notoriously pink Dodge LaFemme of 1955. The LaFemme offered features such as Jacquard upholstery, color-coordinated umbrella, mirror compacts, lipsticks and camera; it was the automotive equivalent to the Eisenhower-era pearls and sweater sets. No wonder housewives abused Valium.\n\nSo what is the connection between car design and gender? Industry researchers have only a few certainties to work with. One is that both men and women tend to shy away from vehicles with a “chick car” label.\n\nIt’s instructive to note that in Europe, the equivalent term for a chick car is a “hairdresser’s car.” Gay, in other words. A chick car is not only feminine in some ineffable way, but feminizing. It imputes femininity — or perhaps a kind of gender-preference valence — upon its owner/driver. Men don’t like having their male credentials called into question; women resist the onus of femininity in the second-sex sense described by Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nConsider the SUV: Few in Detroit could have predicted that these truck-based, hard-to-park, skirt-splitting vehicles would become so popular with women. But women love them, and often the bigger the better. In owner’s surveys, women SUV drivers extol their vehicle’s high seating position and commanding outward view, their sense of invulnerability — in a word, their empowerment.\n\nSo, women want what men want? Not necessarily. Very few women — Angelyne notwithstanding — drive Corvettes, for instance. Corvette has long since pass ed into the popular imagination as a vehicular codpiece, a high-performance sock-in-the-crotch favored by men of a certain age and hairline. This image is as durable as it is patently unfair — the Corvette is one of the world’s great sports cars and I’d take one in a minute, regardless of the snide whispers behind my back. Yet, inescapably, the Corvette is masculine, just as a white VW Rabbit Cabriolet is feminine.\n\nIt’s worth pondering how cars become invested with gender.\n\nThe British poet Caroline Bird has written that “femininity appears to be one of those pivotal qualities so important no one can define it.” But I think, at least when it comes to cars, there are some formal qualities that consumers and observers read as feminine.\n\nOne of these is scale. Cars that are much smaller than average strike us — in the primitive centers of our brains — as feminine. Big vehicles, such as SUVs, are masculine. This schema almost certainly arises from our evolutio ary development where the discernment of sexually dimorphic characteristics at a distance was important to survival. Are those females or males coming over the hill? Never mind, hand me my club.\n\nIt’s not simply a matter of wheelbase and track, however. The Miata, the Mini Cooper, the New Beetle and the PT Cruiser all have diminutive quality about them, a preciousness, a daintiness. They are cute, which is to say they pack a lot of styling attitude in a short space, in ways that utilitarian compacts such as the Hyundai Accent or Mitsubishi Lancer do not.\n\nAggressiveness: the male’s calling card. Three stylistic qualities rule our perception of aggressiveness in car styling: angularity, balance and stance. When BMW redesigned the Z roadster (the Z3 to the Z4), one of the design team’s goals was to give the car a harder edge, an angularity that would be perceived as more masculine. And so the Z3’s previously smooth and sinuous lines were peaked and sharpened like lapels and pants creases, given what BMW’s then-design chief Chris Bangle called “flame surfacing” styling.\n\nOn the other hand, a polished smoothness, a kind of tumescent fullness, tends to be perceived as feminine, as it does in the New Beetle.\n\nBalance refers to the forward-aft placement of the cockpit. Cars with rear-biased cockpit placement, which creates a long-hood, short-deck profile, read as more masculine. It’s easy to mock this styling as phallocentric, because it is. Forty years ago, when front-engine sports cars ruled road racing, the priapic profiles of Jaguars, Aston Martins and Ferraris were the consequence of large inline engines crammed under the hoods. Today, engines are far more compact. But the long-hood look still conveys masculinity, a potent elegance.\n\nConversely, cars with long rear decks and overall symmetry front to rear tend to read as more feminine, cars like the New Beetle, Ford Thunderbird and even the Porsche Boxster.\n\nStance has to do with the car’s position over its wheels. Generally, cars that are lower and wider, with their wheels pushed farther to the corners of the fuselage, have a more aggressive stance. The Mini Cooper’s extremely aggressive stance saves it from terminal cuteness. Cars that are relatively tall compared to their overall length, meanwhile, tend to have a goofy, just-squeeze-them cuteness, like the adorable Suzuki Aerio, Toyota Echo and Scion xB.\n\nSo what about the Lexus SC430? By the standards outlined above, does it read masculine or feminine? Surprisingly, the Lexus casts a shadow almost exactly the same size as the Corvette — the main difference is that the Corvette is some 5 inches lower. Yet at a glance the Lexus appears quite a bit smaller. So it has compactness about it, but it would be hard to classify the car as cute, any more than a Louis Vuitton clutch purse is cute.\n\nThe bodywork is like a river stone. No chin spoilers, air scoops and gills. This conver tible is smooth and ovoid — would “egg-like” be loading the argument? The cockpit is dead amidships so that the hood and rear deck are virtually the same length (a fact that gives the SC430 9 cubic feet of trunk space).\n\nPerhaps the defining difference between SC430 and its competitors — the Jaguar XK8, the Mercedes SL, the Cadillac XLR — is the car’s chic refinement, the ease with which it wears its beauty. It is a car of almost supernatural elegance, from its highly figured wood cabinetry to its nail lacquer finish. Lexus says that the car’s designers found their inspiration in the Cote d’Azur, in the shapes of and textures of Riva powerboats and Cannes catwalks. Cadillac, meanwhile, found inspiration in the Stealth fighter.\n\nGenerally, the more expensive a car, the more expressive the styling, since the design is less constrained by functionality and production costs. Perhaps as a reflection of the disparity of earning power between women and men, luxury cars te d to be aimed at a male audience. Even setting aside the exotic sports cars like swaggering Ferraris and Lamborghinis, luxury sedans — Lexus’ own LS430, BMW’s 745iL, the Mercedes S-class and Audi’s A8L — all have a drawing room heaviness about them, a paternalistic heft.\n\nThe SC430 may be the only luxury car on the market — the first? — that tilts in favor of the mature woman’s tastes, insofar as we dare define them. And that is worth celebrating. As impeccable as a Cole Porter rhyme, as graceful as a Noel Coward smoke ring, the SC430 is about as masculine as either.\n\nAssigning gender specifics to objects in the designed and engineered world may seem like folly — mine, thank you — and yet for reasons not well understood, everybody gets it. It’s well documented that men and women respond differently to color and fine art. Why not car design?\n\nWhile I wait for my NEA research grant, I’m happy to drive the SC430. I don’t feel in any way ambiguous. After all, gender is only skin deep but beauty goes right to the bone.\n\n2004 Lexus SC430\n\nBase price: $63,500\n\nPrice, as tested: $64,109 (including $625 destination fee)\n\nPowertrain: 4.3-liter DOHC 32-valve V8 with variable-valve timing, five-speed automatic transmission, rear-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 300 horsepower at 5,600 rpm\n\nTorque: 325 pound-feet at 3,400 rpm\n\n0-60 mph: 5.9 seconds\n\nCurb weight: 3,840 pounds\n\nLength: 177.8 inches\n\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches\n\nEPA mileage: 18 miles per gallon city, 23 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: There ain’t nothing like a dame",

      "expert_review": "It starts out rather innocently. I’m informed that my next test car won’t really fit into my “normal” demographics. No problem, I’m trying my best not to typecast moms by choosing only stereotypical mom-mobiles to drive; a hatchback, a little sedan, maybe even a coupe – some families might be perfectly comfortable in cars like these.\n\nThen I see it pull into my driveway: a shining, “absolutely red” Lexus SC430 – a premium luxury hardtop convertible. My eyes glass over with daydreams of a night out on the town, hair blowing in the wind, sultry music slinking through the Mark Levinson Stereo System, stopping only to dance the night away with my husband (who hasn’t danced much since our wedding night nearly eight years ago).\n\nIn spite of having a back seat for two with Latch connectors, the SC430 doesn’t comfortably house my kids’ car seats – my hands are tied, I’ll just have to get a babysitter. Before I can even think about it, my fingers are dialing. “You’re available both Friday AND Saturday night?! Great!”\n\nFriday night rolls around and the stars are aligning perfectly. My children both fall asleep for a late nap, leaving me alone to primp without the normal distractions of kids knocking on the shower door, or my favorite lip gloss disappearing only to be discovered later oozing into the carpet in my toddler’s bedroom.\n\nThe babysitter shows up right on time, and my husband meets me downstairs cleanly shaved and smelling delicious. We jump into the SC430 (so red that people just can’t help but stare), hold a small button down and the car that looks nothing like a convertible transforms magically into my dream date-mobile – top-down and all.\n\nArmed with a favorite CD, we crank up the bass. The speakers vibrate through the seats giving me a cheap thrill. Foot on the gas – whoa this thing’s fast. Foot on the gas just a little less and we’re off.\n\nOn the highway, my husband exclaims, “Whoo-hooooo!” I’ve finally found a car that impresses my hubby, who is the most practical and down-to-earth person I know. I ask what he likes about the car. “The wind inside the car is blowing your skirt up.”\n\nOK, so in spite of being practical and down to earth, he’s still a guy after all.\n\nIt’s obvious that the 2005 Lexus SC430 is a great excuse for date night, but my mom instincts aren’t far behind. I appreciate the fact that this car comes with a tire pressure monitoring system (a system that alerts the driver if a tire looses pressure, helping to avoid blowouts) and optional run flat tires (for an additional $400).\n\nWe escape the evening without running over any nails in our construction zone of a neighborhood. However, if we had, we could have driven an additional 100 miles at a whopping 55 MPG without an issue. This is a great feature for moms who may otherwise be stuck on the side of the road for hours on end with hungry and crabby children, waiting for roadside assistance.\n\nI also enjoy the practically sized trunk, well practical as you can get in a sporty number like this: 9.7 cubic feet to be exact. If I absolutely had to, I could fit all my kid-toting equipment and have room left over.\n\nWhen all is said and done, date night is a huge success. We return home feeling reconnected, rejuvenated, and re-energized enough to handle a few more dateless months until the next impractical test car arrives forcing us to head out without the children. It’s only in the interest of thorough journalism that I take this chore upon myself.\n\nLet’s Talk Numbers LATCH connectors: 2 Passenger seating (including driver): 4\n\nIt’s the Little Things That Count Storage Compartments (puny, fair, ample, galore): fair Cargo/Trunk Space (puny, fair, ample, galore): fair\n\nSense and Style Family Friendly (not really, fair, great, excellent): not really Fun-Factor (None, some, good times, groove-on): groove-on",

      "expert_review": "There has been a stylish luxury coupe in the Lexus lineup ever since the Toyota luxury division began more than a decade ago. But the SC430 is the first with a top that goes down.\n\nThe distinctive styling of this lovely Lexus guarantees lots of stares, and the occasional glare, from those appreciative of its handsome contours or envious of its driver. Top up, it’s a snug little hardtop with a long but nicely proportioned rear aspect. Top down, it’s a sporty cruiser looking for some fun.\n\nSC430 is a limited-production car for Lexus, with just 12,000 being made this year and 10,000 planned for subsequent years. That guarantees exclusivity but so does the $58,000-plus base price.\n\nThere’s some Audi TT and a little bit of Mercedes-Benz in the sculpted body design, though SC430 manages to carve its own niche in the ever-broadening ranks of two-seater sports cars.\n\nOh, did I say two-seater? Actually, the SC430 has a leather-trimmed back “seat,” laughably provided with head rests and seat belts, as if two legless, emaciated beings might fit back there.\n\nThe roadster’s signature feature is a foldaway roof similar in style and execution to those on Mercedes’ sports cars: the compact SLK and mighty SL roadster. On the Lexus, it lowers in a graceful ensemble of whirring motors and folding panels, the trunk opening rearward, then closing over the stowed roof. The top takes up most of the trunk, though with the roof up, there is decent room for baggage.\n\nThough small and sporty-looking, the SC430 is really a high-end luxury craft that emphasizes personal comfort and sedate cruising. SC430’s placid ride and light steering feel very much like Lexus sedans, competent and inoffensive, seeming to take the middle road between slick and stodgy. SC is saved from being a flat-out poseur by its roaring V-8 and quirky attitude. This car may be a softy, but it succeeds as a driving toy.\n\nThe engine is the same 4.3-liter, 300-horsepower V-8 found in the performance-oriented GS430 and the high-end LS430 sedan, which is the only Lexus more expensive than the SC430. The brawny engine whips the little SC to 60 mph in less than six seconds, according to Lexus’ figures. The small V-8 is a bit light on torque at lower RPMs but pulls like a husky as the revs climb.\n\nStill, SC430 has a laid-back attitude. It’s a car that inspires sunset drives on quiet roads rather than race-track shenanigans. The only transmission is a smooth five-speed automatic that does not include a manual-shift feature, as do many other sporty cars.\n\nThe interior is quite lush, with its high-end features, thickly padded seats, bird’s-eye wood trim and fabulous stereo. A pair of superfluous but attractive wood covers close over the stereo controls and GPS navigation screen.\n\nAt its base price, the SC400 comes loaded with luxury, performance and technological features, including a nine-speaker Mark Levinson stereo-CD that adjusts its volume when the top is lowered or raised; a tire monitoring system that warns you if a tire is low on air (but it doesn’t say which); an electronic braking system that varies for each wheel depending on traction; Vehicle Skid Control, traction control, anti-lock brakes and brake assist, all of which help drivers stay on course, start smoothly and stop quickly; and side glass that repels water in a rainstorm (not that we’ve seen many of those lately).\n\nA big plus that draws people to the SC430 is the reputation for quality and reliability that Lexus shares with Toyota. The SC feels carefully constructed, solid as a vault.\n\nTo rank the SC430 among the roadster clan: The engine power may be right up there, but all-round performance pales in relation to some of the fine driving machines in this class, including Mercedes SLK320, Porsche Boxster S, Honda S2000, BMW M3, and, of course, Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nSC430 is really more akin to the retro Ford Thunderbird or even Jaguar XK-8, all attractive luxury cruisers built for styling and profiling. And those twilight cruises.",
