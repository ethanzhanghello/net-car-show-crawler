      "expert_review": "The Lexus LS 400 and GS 400:\n\nBoth are built by the same luxury-car division of Toyota Motors. Both are expensive, have four doors and are powered by nearly identical V-8 engines. Yet they are as different as Abbott and Costello.\n\nThe LS 400 is Lexus’ bread-and-butter luxury sedan, its flagship and traditional standard bearer. Comfortable, prestigious, laden with features, the LS is a boulevard cruiser designed for the best neighborhoods.\n\nThe LS 400 is where Lexus first made its mark, showing the world that a Japanese automaker could compete head-on with the high-end luxury marques of Europe and the United States. It’s a big, competent sedan that does everything with poise and precision, but which often is faulted for lacking spirit, flair or personality.\n\nThat’s where the GS 400 comes in. The GS is agile, athletic and as fast as a ’60s muscle car. The GS is firm where the LS is soft. The GS is hyper where the LS is sedate. The GS’ handling is taut and its steering is responsive, where the LS rolls with the punches and steers with the lightest touch.\n\nThe LS gently coddles its passengers, riding like a cloud over the bumps and heaves, isolating driver and passengers from the rough edges of the outside world. The GS is firm, allowing some jostling of the human cargo but still keeping harshness at bay.\n\nPersonally, the LS is the kind of car that makes me yawn. Its styling and behavior shout, “I’m lush and expensive,” but not much else. Sure, I can appreciate the easy-chair comfort and the fabulous stereo, but I don’t relish the limousine ride.\n\nThe GS, on the other hand, has the kind of performance edge that keeps me interested. I never could own a car like this, though. It’s just too quick, too easy to roar past the speed limit without a glance back, at least until you see those blinking red lights coming up in the rearview mirror.\n\nThere is also a GS 300, powered by a 225-horsepower V-6, which should perform most tasks as enjoyably as the V-8 model, only without the strong acceleration.\n\nThe GS 400 works well as a performance sedan, along the lines of BMW 540i, Mercedes-Benz C43 or even Cadillac Seville STS. It’s a car built to inspire, especially on winding desert blacktop where one can sample the precise suspension and balance of this rear-wheel-drive car, and enjoy the opportunity to make the engine sing.\n\nJust be careful not to overdo it. The acceleration is intoxicating, smooth as silk and so easy to push to the limit. The engine roar is heavily muffled, the urgent sound audible from the driver’s seat but not howling for attention.\n\nYes, this is a toy for grown-ups, not kids.\n\nStill, part of the complaint about the LS carries over to the GS. The feeling of strength, precision and excellent engineering is evident throughout the car, but somehow it fails to impart much of a visceral impression. It’s a great machine, but it failed to touch me on an emotional level.\n\nNow, that’s pretty subjective stu ff, and maybe the problem is mine and not the automobile’s. It’s just that some cars make you feel like a partner, even a pal, sharing their abilities and making them your own.\n\nThe GS always seems to be trying to impress, which it does. Matter of fact, this felt like one of the quickest cars I’ve ever driven, whatever the numbers say. What they do say is the 300-horsepower V-8 and five-speed automatic will pull the trim sedan from zero to 60 in less than 6 seconds. That’s pretty fast in anyone’s book.\n\nThe LS is no slouch in the acceleration department, sprinting to 60 in about 6.6 seconds, Lexus says, the slightly greater weight and slightly less horsepower slowing things just a bit, compared with GS. Indeed, the Lexus literature touts the performance abilities of the LS, noting that it is a car of “dual personalities,” luxurious and sporting.\n\nI found it heavily weighted on the luxury side of the equation.\n\nThe test-car GS came with buttons on the steeri ng wheel for man ual shifting, if desired, which I found useful when downshifting into and powering out of a curve. The Lexus system also is more helpful and easier to use than the push-button shifting systems offered on other sporting cars. Still, it’s kind of a gimmick, and most drivers rarely would use the feature, if ever, once the novelty wears off.\n\nThe LS 400 was equipped with a global positioning system, with a video display showing maps and directions. It worked well, but as part of a $5,400 package of GPS, compact-disc changer and power moonroof, it seems overly expensive. In the GS, a CD changer and moonroof were just over $2,000 extra.\n\nThe GS styling looks trim and muscular, tucked in around the edges to make the midsize sedan look smaller than it really is. The 2-year-old body style is distinctive and instantly recognizable, though in some ways it looks almost like a variation on the current Mercedes E-class. The LS obviously takes some of its overall styling cues from the Benz design book.\n\nInside, the GS is fairly spacious, with lots of room behind the wheel for tall drivers and enough room in the back seat for tall offspring.\n\nThe LS feels even more roomy and accommodating, designed with lots of wood and leather. The dashboard looks European, rather like an Audi’s or even a Jaguar’s, with controls and gauges that are well-designed and logically arranged.\n\nDitto for the GS, though its interior seems more distinctive and less derivative.\n\nNaturally, both of these pricey sedans come equipped with a full boatload of accessories, convenience equipment and safety features. A standard Vehicle Control System makes use of the anti-lock braking and traction control to help you keep things under control.\n\nThough the GS is just 2 years old, I’m confident that it will enjoy the same sort of dependability of all Lexus products. That’s part of the draw for these high-end cars, whichever side of the coin you choose: the indisputable fact that they are well-made and extremely reliable.\n\n1999 Lexus LS 400 & GS 400\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedans, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "The Lexus GS series suffered the same fate of any sibling caught in themiddle.\n\nCaught between the entry level ES series and top-drawer LS series, the GSseries seemed like an ignored middle child.\n\nOh, sure. Lexus tried to excite buyers by saying this sedan was thesporting Lexus. But somehow, it never quite gelled.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWith the all-new 1998 GS 300 and GS 400, Toyota finally has endowed thisLexus model with a significant chunk of personality, especially in the 400trim level.\n\nAnd it is all-new. Only front suspension components, crankshaft assemblyand battery were carried over from the previous model.\n\nThis was a serious rethink, but the design took the existing shape and gaveit a decided edge. The greenhouse is rounded, ending in a very short reardeck. Lighting in front and back is gem-like with the front headlamps styledin a unique post-modern fashion. With the optional rear spoiler and a set ofhigh-performance tires on chrome wheels, this car is no visual shrinkingviolet. The often-heard criticism of “me-too” Japanese design can’t be saidof this car.\n\nAnd it’s certainly no shrinking violet in performance terms, either. Thisis one Lexus that loves to party hard.\n\nThe 300 obtains adequate power from its 3.0-liter double overhead-cam six,which pumps out a more than respectable 225 horsepower and 7.6-second 0-60times. But the 400 houses Lexus’s 4.0-liter 32-valve V8, with a six-second0-60 time and a healthy 300 horsepower. It’s a smooth, seamless power plantwith gobs of guts.\n\nPower is fed through the rear wheels courtesy of a five-speed automatictransmission. Shifts are firm and prompt. Speed builds, along with theG-forces, and this car storms down the road with authority.\n\nHandling is sportier than in other Lexi and that also means a firmer ride.But it’s never jarring, merely fun. Make that fun with a capital F.\n\nFor control freaks, the automatic transmission features manual-shiftcapability, courtesy of buttons on the steering wheel spokes. It takes somegetting used to, but can be fun. It seems a little unnatural for thoseaccustomed to the usual stick shifter, but it makes the car stand apart fromits brethren. But why anyone would use it is a mystery. The car shifts betteron its own — and much more smoothly — when left in its automatic mode.\n\nWith all this power, keeping it in check is important, so the car comeswith traction control and anti-lock brakes, which together help prevent skids.Even engine power is retarded to prevent loss of control.\n\nWhen everything does go south, the car comes equipped with front and sideair bags, as well as seat belt pretensioners, which reduce seat belt slack tohold you in place at critical moments.\n\nThe test car came equipped with optional P235/45ZR-17 tires, which providedthe expected performance benefit of quick turn-in and excellent stoppingability. The ride is quite good, with decent road feel. Expansion joints werenot iced, but never harsh, thanks to a firm chassis that controlled the firmride.\n\nA car of this standing deserves a suitable interior. With its rowdyintentions clear, the dash makes a different statement for Lexus.\n\nThe instrument cluster, which consists of three round dials set into hoodsa la a 1971 Ford Torino, are black on white and have a decidedly post-modernlook. A nice touch: Rather than make the speedometer needle opaque in thecenter, one can see the speed through the center stripe.\n\nThe controls are typical Lexus and by now have been copied by almost everymajor luxury car manufacturer. Perched atop the center of the dash are theautomatic climate controls, with individual settings for each passenger. Belowthat is Lexus’ typically excellent audio system, consisting of an AM/FM/cassette/CD player. The CD changer is located conveniently in the glove boxand delivers truly superb sound.\n\nThe seats are very firm, and some might find them too much so. The driv ingp osition is good, aided by a tilt/telescopic steering column and powerdriver’s seat. Room is decent in the back, although this is more of a roomyfour-seater than a true five-seater. Trunk space seems better than theprevious model and is easy to access. Thumbs down, though, for the goosenecktrunk hinges that rob the trunk of some space.\n\nNeedless to say, this car is fun to drive and comfortable in which to ride.The engine is incredibly quiet, except when revved. This car’s lustfulcharacter, speaks of Toyota’s desire to break the Lexus image of being avehicle for a more mature buyer.\n\nIt’s enough to bring out the spoiled brat in all of us, whether we’re themiddle child or not.\n\nAnd isn’t that what cars are supposed to do?\n\n1998 Lexus GS400 Standard: 4.0-liter 32-valve V8 engine, five-speed automatic transmissionwith steering-wheel-mounted shift buttons, four-wheel independentdouble-wishbone suspension, speed-sensitive power rack and pinion steering,four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, 225/55VR-16 tires on aluminum wheels, dualfront and side air bags, electrochromatic mirrors, intermittent wipers,outside mirror defrosters, fog lamps, theft-deterrent system with engineimmobilizer, walnut wood trim, leather trimmed interior, memory system,one-touch express power windows, power door locks, keyless entry, integratedgarage door opener, power front seats, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, dualzone automatic climate control, AM/FM/cassette audio system.
