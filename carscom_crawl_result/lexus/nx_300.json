      "expert_review": "CARS.COM\n\nCompetes with: Audi Q5, Lincoln MKC, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC\n\nLooks like: An angry Pokemon\n\nDrivetrains: Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or 2.5-liter hybrid-electric four-cylinder engine; six-speed automatic or two-speed continuously variable transmission; front- or all-wheel drive\n\nHit dealerships: TBD\n\nLexus has taken the wraps off its new NX compact SUV at the 2017 Shanghai auto show, the first refresh of the popular luxury model since its introduction three years ago. For the 2018 model year, Lexus has kept the updates simple: lightly updated styling, a mildly redone interior, some new displays and new interior trim. A sportier looking F Sport trim is available with more aggressive jet-black trim, exclusive wheels and metallic interior trim.\n\nExterior\n\n\nLexus has updated the NX’s front and rear styling with new grilles, bumpers, lights and trim. Up front, the NX gets a restyled hood and lights that flow better into the doors and fenders, while the new three-projector headlights evoke the look of the ultra-luxury LC500 coupe. In back, new taillights and a new rear bumper complete the look with longer L-shaped light elements and chrome-tipped exhaust pipes. It also gets a new 18-inch wheel design.\n\nInterior\n\n\nNot too much is new inside, and the biggest news is the new 10.3-inch display screen sitting atop the center control panel, replacing the smaller 7-inch model. It’s still a display only, however, with the controls for it on the center console. The remote touch interface pad is now larger for easier operation with a larger palm rest for better comfort. The climate control buttons also have been revised for easier use, and everything gets a new satin paint finish.\n\nIn back, the NX gets a foot-swipe-operated hatch to let you pop open the door while your arms are full.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nPowertrains carry over this year, with the base model NX300 (formerly called the NX200t) getting a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 235 horsepower in the 2017 trim, and Lexus did not mention any changes for 2018. An optional hybrid model, the NX300h, is available with a 154-hp gas-electric powertrain. The turbo gets a six-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid comes with a continuously variable unit. Front-wheel drive is standard on the NX300 with all-wheel drive an option; AWD is standard on the hybrid.\n\nLexus has updated the NX’s suspension with retuned springs, stabilizer bars and bushings for improved turn-in response and cornering behavior. The ride should be improved thanks to new shock absorbers, and a new adaptive variable suspension that uses tuning from the LC500 coupe is available.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAs before, the new NX comes standard with the Lexus Safety System Plus. That package includes a precollision system, dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert and automatic high beams.\n\nLook for the new NX in showrooms sometime later this year.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission; the NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lexus NX?\n\nModels built after Oct. 1, 2018, include Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Meanwhile, the subscription-based Lexus Enform Remote feature adds functionality, allowing users to access remote start and door lock features using a smart watch in addition to their smartphone.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nBesides standard Apple CarPlay for 2019, all NX trims include a host of electronic safety and convenience features, including a Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after initial trial), pedestrian detection with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high-beam headlights. The hybrid NX 300h has standard all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined – 6 mpg better than the front-drive NX 300.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized and easy-to-handle package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad interface isn’t great to use, either.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nModels built after Oct. 1, 2019, include Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A power-adjustable steering wheel is also standard.\n\nA Black Line Special Edition of the NX 300 is also available. Limited to 2,000 copies, it features 18-inch bronze wheels, a black grille surround, black foglight housings and black mirror caps. Interior features include bronze accent stitching and a black headliner.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nBesides standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, all NX trims include a host of electronic safety and convenience features, including a Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after initial trial), automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. The hybrid NX 300h has standard all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined – 6 mpg better than the front-drive NX 300.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad interface isn’t great to use, either.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nThe Lexus NX 300 compact luxury SUV and its hybrid variant, the NX 300h, slot below the RX in Lexus’ lineup. The NX 300 gets a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The NX 300h’s hybrid drivetrain includes a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motors for a total system output of 194 hp. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on the NX 300, while the NX 300h is only available with all-wheel drive. Both models seat up to five people and compete with the Acura RDX, Infiniti QX50 and Volvo XC60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is now standard, along with power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus NX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nDual-zone climate control\nPower-adjustable steering wheel\n8-inch multimedia screen\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity \nWi-Fi hot spot with free trial \nAutomatic emergency braking \nAdaptive cruise control \nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPower moonroof\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation with 10.3-inch screen\nMark Levinson premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus NX?\n\nThe NX offers a high-quality interior with a surprisingly roomy backseat in a reasonably sized package. While the NX 300h gets better mileage, its drivetrain responses and mushy brakes diminish the driving experience. The SUV’s touchpad multimedia interface isn’t great to use, either.",
