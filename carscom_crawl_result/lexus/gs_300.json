      "expert_review": "Most of the attention generated by the new Lexus GS sedans has been dominated by the GS 400 and its 300-horsepower V8. But its little sister, the GS 300, may be the most sensible.\n\nI came to that conclusion while rolling past the endless cornfields of central Illinois on my way back to Kansas City from visiting my father. Sure, the GS 400’s muscular V8 would be fun, as would the finger-tip shifting of the five-speed automatic transmission, but the price begins around $45,000. The GS 300, which has a 6-cylinder engine, starts around $37,000, has the same space-efficient design, the same Vehicle Skid Control system and the same 5-speed automatic transmission, minus fingertip shifting. True, not many folks who shop in this mid-luxury segment are price-conscious, but why not save what you can when you can?\n\nIn place of the GS 400’s V8 sits a 3.0-liter, 6-cylinder with four-valves per cylinder, Variable Valve Timing and 225 horsepower. This engine has been thoroughly reworked for this year. It is uncommonly smooth, and is strong enough to push the 300 to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, versus 6 seconds for the 400. Its EPA fuel economy rating is 20 mpg city and 25 highway.\n\nTwo-hundred and twenty-five horsepower moves this car along smartly, which I found while passing trucks on a two-lane highway. Whether I rolled into the throttle or manually shifted down to third, the big six had more than enough punch to leap around 18-wheelers like they had shifted into reverse. The sound it makes at high rpm is positively delightful.\n\nThe standard aural cues, such as the howl from the wind and road, have been subdued, and that makes this car deceptively fast. If you drive by ear you are likely to find yourself running way past the speed limit, especially on empty roads where the lack of traffic confounds your frame of reference.\n\nThe GS is new from the ground up. Wide-eyed styling dominates the front, while the small flares that bulge over each wheel create a muscular look. Although it has a 110.2-inch wheelbase, extremely short overhangs front and rear keep overall length to 189 inches. The passenger compartment, however, has not been sacrificed. Interior volume exceeds both the BMW 5-series and the Mercedes-Benz E-class. The back seat can hold three people, although two is more comfortable.\n\nThe back seat does not fold down, and that limits the size and scope of things that can be carried in the trunk.\n\nHandling is precise, but not at the expense of a harsh ride. The double-wishbone independent suspension uses aluminum upper arms in back for less weight. Fling it into a turn and body roll is moderate but not excessive. The front-engine/rear-wheel-drive configuration gets traction control and anti-lock brakes standard. Vehicle Skid Control, also standard, uses the anti-lock brake and traction control sensors to help avoid skids by applying an individual brake when the computer detects the vehicle needs assistance.\n\nUp fro nt, the cabin is comfortable, yet its sporty design appeals to enthusiast drivers. The three-spoke wheel has perforated leather sections for your hands; gauges have “Optitron” lighting that silhouettes the pointers and numbers against an off-white background; and wood accents bring warmth to the all-leather upholstery. The automatic climate control system has separate controls for each side, a charcoal filter to remove dust and pollen from the air and an air pollution sensor that recirculates interior air when it detects contamination outside.\n\nBoth the windows and sunroof have one-touch open and close, with pinch protection.\n\nDuring a six-hour drive I found the front seats to be quite good, although I would have liked a bit more under-thigh support. The seat back tilts back almost flat, which is good when your passenger wants to nap (mine did). Side airbags are built into the seats and pretensioners remove the slack from the seatbelts in an accident.\n\nThe seven-spea r, five-amplifier stereo system is excellent. Our car was equipped with the optional six-disc CD changer that fits in the dash where the glove box would normally be.\n\nThe storage bin in the center console has a power outlet which is good for a portable phone.\n\nWhile the GS 300 does not have the outright power the GS 400, it offers a balanced package of performance, handling and price that makes it most attractive.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $36,800. Options included leather trim and heated seats, in-dash CD player, power sunroof, floor mats and wheel locks. The sticker price was $41,704.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The GS 300 offers a good combination of performance, handling, comfort and fuel economy. Not as fast as the V8-engined GS 400, it has more than enough power for most folks. The interior is plush, functional and big enough for five.\n\nCounterpoint: I would like to see a split-folding back seat to increase the hauling capacity of the trunk.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.0-liter, 6-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 110.2 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,635 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $36,800\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $41,704\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 25 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "In just three short years Toyota’s Lexus division has unseated Mercedes-Benz to become the most popular make of imported luxury cars sold in the United States.\n\nWith such vehicles as the LS 400 sedan and SC 400 sport coupe, Lexus has earned a reputation for exceptional quality and unequaled value.\n\nYet one of those elements – unequaled value – is missing in the newest Lexus, the GS 300 mid-size sports sedan.\n\nThe GS 300 is an expensive car that, when compared to its rivals, comes up a bit short on performance and interior room.\n\nBMW, Mercedes, Volvo and other European sports sedans offer reasonable alternatives. So do rival Japanese autos from Acura and Infiniti.\n\nAnd some equally priced American cars, such as the Cadillac Seville STS, Lincoln Mark VIII, easily top the newest Lexus. For instance, you get high-performance V-8s in the Cadillac and Lincoln, but only a six-cylinder in the GS 300.\n\nOne other note: To illustrate how expensive Japanese vehicles have become, the GS 300 is priced higher than the top-of-the-line Lexus LS 400 when that vehicle debuted in November of 1989.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nMechanically, the GS 300 is the result of a marriage between the SC 300 coupe and the LS 400 luxury sedan.\n\nThe GS 300’s 3.0-liter, 24-valve six-cylinder is the same engine that powers the SC 300. It develops 220 horsepower and runs as smoothly as a sewing machine.\n\nAll GS 300s come with the transmission that is used in the LS 400, an exceptionally smooth-shifting, computer-controlled, four-speed automatic. No manual gearbox is available, and one isn’t likely to be offered, according to Lexus officials.\n\nLexus quotes a 0-to-60 mph time of 8.5 seconds. That seems a little optimistic. The 3,672-pound car felt quick – but not that fast.\n\nAs with every other Lexus, mechanical noises are so well-muffled, you can’t really hear what’s going on. That’s too bad, because in a sporty car, I like to hear a slight growl from the exhaust and the high-pitched whine of camshafts. It makes the driving experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nFuel consumption was reasonable at 22 miles per gallon on a trip from Miami to Orlando. In the city, the GS 300 returned 16 mpg of premium unleaded.\n\nHANDLING\n\nLexus engineers ripped a page out the BMW bible of high-performance suspension systems when they created the GS 300.\n\nFor starters, the anti-lock brakes on the GS 300 are tremendous. Powerful, strong and fade-free, the four-wheel ventilated discs can make the speedometer needle return to zero in a heartbeat.\n\nOf all the features on the GS 300, the brakes were the most impressive. They added greatly to the overall feeling of safety and performance.\n\nThe same can’t be said for the steering, which seemed a bit flaccid. The power-assisted rack and pinion steering is what engineers call vehicle-speed-sensitive. That means the effort required to turn the wheel varies with the speed of the car, not the speed of the engine.\n\nWhen you are parallel parking, for example, the wheel is very easy to turn. However, when bolting down the interstate at 65 mph, the steering takes a bit more effort. That helps give the driver a better feel for the road.\n\nIfelt the steering was too light at all speeds. Also, the front wheels did not center themselves quickly after a turn. However, the steering is responsive. There’s little play, and lane changes require little more than a slight flick of the wrist.\n\nCorners can be negotiated very crisply. The turning circle is a respectable 36.1 feet.\n\nAs with other Lexus models, the independent suspension system dispenses with most bumps.\n\nThe suspension is quite firm, but the ride does not punish the driver.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe GS 300 is equipped with the same style of analog gauges as the LS 400. That is, they are encased in an instrument cluster that is covered with dark plastic. When you turn the ig ition key, the gauges light up.\n\nAs in the LS 400, the gauges are classy, easy-to-read, and nicely la id out.\n\nAlso borrowed from the LS 400 is the electronically adjustable steering wheel. Move a joystick-like switch and the wheel automatically tilts and telescopes.\n\nIf the GS 300 has a weak point, it would be a lack of interior room.\n\nFor instance, I didn’t have enough foot room when driving. With the cruise control engaged and my foot off the accelerator, I could find no comfortable place to set my foot.\n\nRear seat passengers over 6 feet may find the GS 300 a bit cramped. Leg room in the rear is tight, and rear vision is not good. The high rear trunk makes looking out the back a bit of a chore. What might help is a longer rear-view mirror.\n\nOptions in the test car pushed the price of the GS 300 into another class. The built-in phone, CD player, leather package and sunroof added a whopping $3,713 to the $37,500 base price.\n\nIn any case, the front bucket seats were comfortable, but, in general, the interior lacked a sense of warmth.\n\nIf you compare the GS 300 to the Infiniti J30, you’ll see what I mean.\n\nThe J30 looks inviting, and its classy antique-looking clock helps give that car’s interior a bit of personality and class.\n\nThe GS 300 comes off as a bit cold, maybe it’s because there’s really nothing new here.\n\nOutside, the styling is the strongest of any Lexus sedan. It still demonstrates a Mercedes-Benz influence, but without being too bland.\n\nTruett’s tip: The newest Lexus sports European styling, and offers decent performance and excellent handling. But, because of its high price, the GS 300 may be the first Lexus that fails to be an overwhelming success.",

      "expert_review": "As I get into this “Champagne Pearl” Lexus, I immediately notice its catchy, soft lines, accentuated with just the right amount of chrome. It’s curvy, graceful, and elegant. Once inside, I take note that the cabin is highlighted with a subtle touch of stylish wood and leather.\n\nJaunting along, I enjoy a perfect moment in time, completed by the stereo’s lyrical accompaniment. The sun filters through the moon roof and radiates off the light interior. The car’s gold exterior glistens and gleams in the sun. I feel as though I have been outfitted with sparkly gold-plated armor for the day, which will have me emerge victorious in whatever mommy-battle I may face … that is, until my 1-year-old hurls his sippy cup clear across the car into the front passenger seat. Apparently, he has taken note of his mother’s brief indulgence in pure delight. I am jolted back to the “here and now.”\n\nLet’s get right down to function. The back-up camera is a mommy’s dream. As a typical frazzled mom, I have had only near misses with the recycling bin when backing out of the driveway. With this camera, I don’t have to play the weekly guessing game of, “Just where exactly did the garbage men leave the bin?” Furthermore, and more importantly, I can verify with my own eyes if a little tyke has set up shop or left his “toolbox” behind my vehicle, especially critical since my 4-year-old likes repairing everything from toilets to automobiles.\n\nI can also make great use of the compass in the rearview mirror. My inattentiveness to directions is commonplace (I blame it on the kids), and this guide prevents me from ending up at the state line. Glimpsing at the compass while playing my preschooler’s new favorite game of, “what direction are we driving?” I notice a little surprise: an overhead compartment for sunglasses. How stellar!\n\nMy fingers are put to task with the following steering wheel buttons: Audio Control (channel seek, volume), Bluetooth Phone Connect/Disconnect, and Voice Recognition. The voice recognition allows me to operate yet another critical setting, the climate control. All hands-free operations are a big plus in my book as I am forever tempted to blindly fish around my diaper bag for items such as wipes, cheese sticks, toys and sippy cups.\n\nThankfully, the park assist guide enables me to parallel-park swiftly in a tight spot, without having to wave down a passerby for help. As I get close to the car behind me, the computer screen flashes a series of lines, which refer to the distance until impact.\n\nThe keyless entry feature wins my seal of approval. Since the car recognizes my remote, I am able to open the door by pulling the handle, while successfully balancing the baby, diaper bag, water bottle, keys, mail, pacifier, etc. Later, while locking the car, I juggle everything from above plus the trash that’s accumulated and multiplied while driving. I push the black button on the handle as I close the door. Simple, logical, no hassle … you bet!\n\nThe trunk is my least favorite aspect of the Lexus GS 300. While running errands, I think up every excuse not to pull my stroller out of the itsy-bitsy trunk opening. I opt to carry my 1-year-old around, while I pick up a few (a.k.a. way more than a few) things. Out of desperation, I revert back to the use of my Baby Bjorn. I also decide that the much needed power-walk, to work off last night’s cheese/chocolate fondue smorgasbord can wait a few more days until after I return the car – all to avoid the much-dreaded trunk visit. I could desperately use some protective gear, as it is a battle that leaves me scraped, scratched and stained. Yuck! On a more positive note, an umbrella stroller family would be just fine.\n\nI am sorry to see the Lexus GS 300AWD leave so soon, although I must confess, I am looking forward to stroller outings and power-walks again. Also, even though, I am able to snuggly fit 2 boosters and 1 car seat in the back, things do get a bit cramped with “bambinos.” My last thoughts on the subject: Quintessential Chic Femme Mobile? Definitely. Cosmopolitan?

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe 2019 Lexus GS is a mid-size luxury sedan that seats up to five people. The GS 300 is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the GS 350 uses a 311-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The GS 300 comes with rear-wheel drive; the GS 350 can have rear- or all-wheel drive. A high-performance rear-wheel-drive GS F features a 467-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS 300 and GS 350 have no significant changes. The GS F, meanwhile, now offers a limited-edition 10th Anniversary Special Edition that features matte-gray paint, blue Brembo brake calipers, black 19-inch BBS wheels with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, and blue interior accents. Lexus will build only 100 for the U.S. market.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lexus GS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include LED headlights, heated side mirrors, a power moonroof, an 8-inch multimedia screen and a power-adjustable steering column. Standard active safety features include full-speed adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist.\n\nOptions include built-in navigation with a 12.3-inch screen, a Mark Levinson premium stereo, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, a powered trunk lid and a limited-slip differential.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lexus GS?\n\nThe GS' interior quality and comfort impress, along with its ride and handling, but we're not fans of the Remote Touch multimedia interface, and the optional Mark Levinson stereo was disappointing.",
