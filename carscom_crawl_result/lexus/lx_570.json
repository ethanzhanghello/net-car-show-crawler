      "expert_review": "For 2009, Lexus made its vastly improved top-of-the-line SUV more luxurious.\n\nLipstick on a dinosaur? Far from it — no matter what some groups may shout in an overly shrill voice. SUVs still serve a purpose. They still have unmatched capabilities and still can do things crossovers and cars can only dream about.\n\nDuring January’s heavy snowfall, I hopped into the new Lexus LX 570 and burrowed my way down the road without a problem. The full-time four-wheel drive ate up snow and ice like “Survivor Man” in the Canadian Rockies. Detroit’s unplowed streets were a mild urban safari that might have disabled lesser vehicles. But this SUV provides confidence in bad weather and can easily handle much more dire conditions. From behind the wheel of the LX 570, you can hum “Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow” all day long.\n\nWhile it has the raw power to muscle its way through most problems, it uses a much more sophisticated approach.\n\nThe four-wheel active traction control employs the vehicle’s brakes and throttle to control wheel spin, while the stability control helps keep the LX 570 moving in the right direction. But the power is there.\n\nUsing the same powertrain as the Toyota Tundra pickup, the LX 570 has 383 horsepower and a stump-yanking 403 pound-feet of torque at its disposal. The low-end torque (90 percent is available at 2,200 rpm) is especially useful. While I imagine most Lexus owners keep their boats in a slip, they could tow one (up to 8,500 pounds) with the LX 570.\n\nScience and gee-whiz gadgetry\n\nThe beauty behind this brawny powerplant is the science involved. It uses all kinds of gee-whiz gadgetry to push performance and efficiency. There’s the dual variable valve timing on the intake and exhaust valves to create more power without producing more emissions. There is an acoustic control induction system to improve torque throughout the engine’s range. These are just a few reasons to love science.\n\nThe end result is a 6,000-pound SUV that can go from 0-60 mph in just 7.4 seconds. It still manages to get 12 miles per gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway — respectable numbers when you look at serious competitors such as the all-wheel-drive Cadillac Escalade (12 mpg city / 19 mpg highway) and Mercedes Benz GL 550 (13 mpg city and 17 mpg highway).\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission remains silky smooth despite the high torque numbers. There’s a manual override on the system for downshifting or sportier driving, though most of the time that feels unnecessary. The LX 570’s height makes it uncomfortable to push hard through corners. The body rolls like a yacht on rough waters. However, the braking, which I expected to be underwhelming due to the vehicle’s size, was remarkably good.\n\nBuilt for rugged conditions\n\nLike most LX 570 drivers, I never tested the vehicle’s real off-road prowess, though I have no doubt it would perform quite well. Built on the same underpinnings as the Toyota Land Cruiser — an extreme off-roader proven under real-world conditions in some of the most desolate places on Earth — this Lexus should offer the same extreme capabilities with luxury appointments.\n\nFor war-torn landscapes or just steep trails, the LX 570 includes a crawl feature that allows the SUV to transverse rugged conditions. Crawl Control monitors vehicle speed, engine output and braking to maintain one of three speeds. The system can work in conjunction with the vehicle’s hill-start assist feature, which prevents the LX 570 from rolling backward when starting from a stop on a steep hill.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting feature on the LX 570 is the Active Height Control, which can lower the LX 570 by 2 inches to make ingress and egress easier. The system can also lower the LX 570’s body by about an inch when on the highway. This is the equivalent to an airplane that changes its wings as it flies faster — and something you should expect to see a lot more of in future vehicles. Switch the LX 570 into a low gear and the SUV will lift up the body. This can change the vehicle’s approach angle, that measure that determines if you’ll clear a big rock, by 2 degrees, from 29 degrees in normal mode to 31 degrees in high.\n\nFor customers seeking luxury\n\nPolishing the inside of the LX 570 was a tall order. After all, it was pretty nice to begin with.\n\nThere’s a relaxing curve to the current generation of Lexus vehicles. All of the materials are high-end and the touch points are soft. Even the old-fashioned turning dials for the heated seats feel right — plus there’s the bonus of the seat always remaining in the on position when you start this SUV. Nothing is more annoying than realizing your heated seat is off and you lost 15 minutes of toasty goodness on your drive to work.\n\nFor the 2009 model year, Lexus added a Bubinga wood trim around the cabin. There’s also a new cool box in the big center console to keep soda at a drinkable temperature.\n\nBut the luxury doesn’t end there. When you’re cruising along at night, bathed in cool blue lighting, looking down at the six dash-mounted dials and center display screen, you feel as if the world is at your finger tips. For the most part, it is.\n\nLexus knows how to make American drivers feel comfortable. From the push-button start and the cooled seats to the rear entertainment system and the 30-gigabyte hard drive system, the interior caters to luxury customers.\n\nThe Mark Levinson surround sound stereo belts out 450-watts of music and the system’s hard drive can store 2,000 songs. The second row is as comfortable as the front and Lexus keeps the climate throughout at just the right temperature. There are 28 vents to make sure everyone is comfortable. The third row is a little snug for adults, offering 28.3 inches of legroom, but otherwise there are few complaints.\n\nSafety features big plus\n\nI really liked the way Lexus has included the power retractable third row. Just open the liftgate with the remote and press a button and watch the seats fold up and out of the way. With the third row folded up, there is 41 cubic feet of space. Fold down the 40/20/40 second row and there is more than 83 cubic feet of space. That keeps the U in SUV.\n\nAnother advantage to this big vehicle is all of the safety features. Lexus has loaded it up with 10 standard air bags, including front and second-row side mounted air bags and side-curtain air bags for all three rows. There is also active head rests in the front, a pre-collision system that prepares the vehicle for an accident before it happens. There is also the wide-view front and side monitor that allows the driver to press a button for better front and passenger side views to squeeze into tight spots.\n\nOf course, this is needed because of the vehicle’s size. The lines of sight are limited and the cameras help in places like parking spots and garages. It can take a week getting used to driving a big vehicle, but the LX 570 takes less time.\n\nAs soon as you adjust to driving this SUV, you’ll never want to go back to something less luxurious. That’s one of the beauties of these big vehicles. The high riding position, the available power, that wonderful leather smell every time you open the door, they all play a part in improving your day.\n\nThis is an SUV that comes without apologies: So why should its drivers say they’re sorry?\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Despite being refreshed this year, the Lexus LX 570 still feels like an old-school SUV, with sluggish road manners that reflect its portliness.\n\nVersus the competition: As far as big, three-row luxury SUVs go, the Lexus is mostly competitive, lacking few amenities aside from some of the more advanced safety technologies, but its dated SUV design and behavior won’t appeal to some buyers.\n\nThe Lexus LX 570 is the flagship SUV of Toyota’s luxury brand and a rarity on American roads. Lexus doesn’t sell many of these battlewagons, and for good reason: They’re extremely expensive.\n\nBuilt off the Toyota Land Cruiser and sharing that SUV’s many, highly capable electronic 4×4 systems, the LX 570 represents an upgrade of sorts. It can do everything the already expensive and luxurious Land Cruiser can do (and arguably more, thanks to its air suspension), but does so while swaddling passengers in a cocoon of leather, wood and sound insulation.\n\nThe LX received a refresh for 2016 (compare it with the outgoing 2015 model here), gaining new styling, a new transmission, a new multimedia system, some interior refinements and a bunch of new electronic safety systems. The price has gone up a hair, as well. But with the Toyota Land Cruiser’s price landing within just a few thousand dollars of the fancier Lexus, the question becomes: Is the LX different enough to justify paying even more?\nStyling & Exterior\nOn some Lexus models, the new spindle grille and Nike-swoosh headlights work. On others, like on the LX 570, they look like the angry helmet from a Battlestar Galactica Cylon robot. With the long overhangs, relatively short wheelbase and styling that doesn’t know when to quit, it just has to be said: The LX is a special kind of ugly.\n\nYou can’t fault Lexus for making it distinctive, but the Toyota Land Cruiser is a far more attractive, elegant and clean-looking design. I guess when one isn’t terribly worried about fuel economy, one can do crazy things with slats, creases, folds, grilles and strakes — and Lexus certainly has.\n\nYou’re not likely to mistake the LX 570 for anything else on the road, except perhaps the Infiniti QX80, which somehow manages to be equally odd-looking. The Cadillac Escalade, by comparison, is oversized but elegant, with sharp creases and clean lines, while the newly refreshed 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class successfully brings the S-Class sedan’s sweeping lines to a more upright vehicle. Anything from Land Rover is better-looking, as well. It just didn’t need to look like this, Lexus.\nHow It Drives\nYour first clue that this is an old-school SUV is the short wheelbase and big overhangs at the front and rear. The second clue is the way it drives, which is slow and ponderous. It feels like a heavy truck because it is. Though smaller than the Escalade, GLS or QX80, at 6,000 pounds it’s the heaviest of the four. Combine that with the least-powerful engine in the group — a 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 — and you have an SUV with lazy around-town acceleration and a general distaste for changing directions quickly. The LX 570 isn’t underpowered, but it’s tuned toward relaxed responses: acceleration is only moderate unless you really plant your foot, gear shifts are smooth but come early, and the steering behavior is slow and highly boosted.\n\nHighway travel is subdued and stress-free, unless you happen to be driving through a windy environment, where crosswinds play havoc with the Lexus’ straight-line stability. The LX 570’s air suspension provides for a remarkably smooth and quiet ride, and it can also be set to automatically lower the truck when parked and keyed off, which is helpful when it comes to getting in and out of the tall SUV.\n\nBraking performance is also strong, with a firm pedal that brings the heavy truck to a halt with confidence.\n\nThe LX 570 has a host of electronic four-wheel-drive features that reportedly make it quite the mountain goat in rough stuff, but the idea of going off-road anywhere but the fields of the local polo club in an SUV this big and expensive seems unlikely.\n\nAll-wheel drive is provided via a Torsen limited-slip center differential that can be locked by the driver. A Multi-Terrain Select system then allows the driver to choose a setting for the all-wheel-drive system that matches the environment: Rock, Rock and Dirt, Moguls, Loose Rock, or Mud and Sand. A low range is also available for serious off-roading, as is the electronic Crawl Control that’s been so ably demonstrated on other Toyota SUVs. But all its fancy plastic cladding will still limit the LX’s abilities over more challenging terrain.\n\nThe LX 570’s competitors all feature luxurious, quiet motoring experiences similar to the Lexus, but they all feel nimbler and quicker. The new Mercedes-Benz GLS offers four powertrains, but in price and equipment, the GLS550 matches up best with the LX 570 thanks to its 449-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.7-liter V-8 and nine-speed automatic transmission. The Cadillac Escalade Platinum also compares favorably, with its enormous 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic. Even the Infiniti QX80 outguns the LX with its 400-hp, 5.6-liter V-8, but it makes do with just a seven-speed automatic.\n\nThe LX 570 is the heaviest of this group and possesses the aerodynamics of an apartment building, and it shows at the pump. Its gas mileage is rated 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined, and it delivers on that rating; my week in the LX included a jaunt from Detroit to Toronto during which I netted 15 mpg overall. That’s about the same as the four-wheel-drive Infiniti QX80, which is rated 13/19/15 mpg, but the Mercedes-Benz GLS550 is rated slightly better, at 14/18/16 mpg. Topping them all, surprisingly, is the biggest truck with the biggest engine: The four-wheel-drive Cadillac Escalade is rated 15/21/17 mpg, which still isn’t very good.\nInterior\nI once criticized the Toyota Land Cruiser for being an excellent $50,000 SUV that costs $80,000, and a big reason for that was its plain, if well-built, interior. The Lexus comes a lot closer to being worth its price ($96,905 for the loaded version I drove) than the Toyota, with significant upgrades to the cabin that make it more competitive with other luxury SUVs. Real wood and lots of leather abound, but it’s more than just slapping on some expensive materials; the dash is completely different, as is the multimedia system. The second and third rows are both power-folding affairs instead of being manually manipulated, and gazing around the interior of the LX 570 is far more pleasant than beholding the SUV from the outside.\n\nThe interior is comfortable, too, with big seats up front that have standard heating and optional cooling. The second row has plenty of legroom and even a power sliding function, but the third row remains fit for children only due to a lack of legroom. Lexus says you can fit three abreast in the third row, but that would likely be three children.\n\nVisibility is good thanks to a high seating position and tall windows all around. But that same high seating position also makes for an unusual driving setup, with the steering wheel angled more horizontally than in newer SUVs — like that of a city bus or an RV. You get used to it, but it’s a little disconcerting at first.\n\nWhile the Lexus’ interior is upscale, it’s still outdone by the latest from Mercedes-Benz. The new 2017 GLS-Class also feels far more premium than the Infiniti QX80, and it gives the posh Cadillac Escalade (which is let down by touch-sensitive controls) a run for its money.\n\nAs for overall interior room, the Lexus is quite large. Only the Cadillac offers more passenger space, rated at 172 cubic feet versus the Lexus’ 159 cubic feet. The Infiniti is third, at 152 cubic feet, while the Mercedes-Benz is rather small, with only 144 cubic feet to play with inside.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe update to the LX brought a new multimedia system, which, sad to say, includes the reviled mouse-like controller we’ve come to hate in other Lexus products. To say that it’s hard to use and a massive distraction while driving is an understatement. Imagine trying to use a laptop and mouse on the center console while you’re driving 70 mph, or negotiating a busy city street. That’s essentially our impression of Lexus’ multimedia system; it’s in dire need of a rethink. When compared with the multidirectional knob in the Mercedes-Benz or even Cadillac’s touch-screen CUE system, the Lexus system falls well short of being competitive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered, either.\nCargo & Storage\nThe LX 570 is a big truck, but its cargo area is compromised by the design of its third row. Like in the Land Cruiser, in order to store the third row the seatbacks must fold forward, then the split seats fold up against the sides of the cargo area. This leaves a decent space in the middle and plenty of height for larger items, but not much width. Cargo volume is rated 15.5 cubic feet behind the third row and is expandable to a maximum of 83.1 cubic feet. Most of these big, three-row SUVs have similar cargo room behind the third row, but the Lexus shows a deficiency in max room — the GLS comes with 93.8 cubic feet of total cargo space, the Escalade is expandable to 94.2 cubic feet and the Infiniti QX80 has 95.1 cubic feet.\nSafety\nThe 2016 LX 570 has not yet been crash-tested, but results will be posted here if and when it is.\n\nThe LX has received a number of updates to its electronic safety systems for 2016, including the arrival of Lexus’ Safety System Plus, which now includes a pre-collision preparation system, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, all-speed dynamic cruise control, and an intelligent high-beam system for the headlights. A panoramic around-view camera and parking sensors are standard, but more advanced systems like forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are not available. See all the LX 570’s standard safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nLike the Toyota Land Cruiser, the fancier Lexus LX 570 does not come cheap, but nor does it need much added; almost everything comes standard. The LX 570’s base price is $89,830 including destination fee, and there are just a few options you can add, including a Mark Levinson 19-speaker audio system; a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system; a luxury package with upgraded leather, cooled front seats and heated second-row seats; and a head-up display. All those options brought my as-tested price up to $96,905.\n\nThere are several competitors in this price class, each with varying levels of off-road ability and luxury content. The Mercedes-Benz GLS550 is a solid competitor, featuring a more powerful twin-turbocharged V-8, a more luxurious interior, a better multimedia system and more interior cargo room than the LX 570. It can also tow more, with a maximum 7,500-pound trailer rating versus the Lexus’ 7,000-pound rating.\n\nThe Infiniti QX80 has a similar pedigree as the Lexus; it’s based on the Nissan Patrol SUV, which competes internationally with the Toyota Land Cruiser. Like the Lexus, the Infiniti has been considerably upgraded, with a much nicer interior, a powerful engine and a higher price, though it isn’t quite as dear as the Lexus’ sticker.\n\nThe Cadillac Escalade is one of the original big luxury SUVs, and in recent years its price has been creeping up, along with its sophistication. You can option one up to just shy of $100,000, but it’ll include features such as Cadillac’s outstanding Magnetic Ride Control suspension, a Driver Assist Package of safety tech including automatic emergency braking, a four-color head-up display and more. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Luxury SUV buyers don’t drive in the same world as the rest of us. Clearly, if they can afford $70,000-plus SUVs they can afford gas that costs $4 a gallon — or more for the premium gas that many luxury SUVs require. That’s why the new Lexus LX 570 can come on the scene with its head held high, showing off an all-new look inside and out, plus a much more powerful engine that, yes, gets gas mileage that’s nearly identical to the outgoing model, the LX 470. Check out a comparison of the 2007 and 2008 models here.\n\nIs it enough? While the eight-seat Lexus LX 570 is certainly a remarkable update of the previous model, it competes with an array of tough competition from Land Rover, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and even Cadillac. In the end, its best weapon is that it is a Lexus through and through. It offers the cushy, quiet ride you expect, along with plenty of space for the family, but there are few SUVs on the market with such a high price tag.\n\nLooks\nIt would have been hard for Lexus not to improve on the slab-sided look of the LX 570’s predecessor, but making an SUV of this magnitude look stylish is a tough task. The LX 570 is still a bit slab-sided, but the oversized grille borders between menacing and elegant and flows well into the hood.\n\nThe rear is a bit less interesting. A huge rear window, which is great for visibility, is hard to design around, and Lexus left things pretty much bare back there except for a pair of wraparound taillights. It’s an interesting idea, but a lot of sheet metal was left with no design touches at all.\n\nLuckily, minimalism works, and Lexus buyers aren’t traditionally looking for the wildest designs. Almost all of the LX 570’s competition is more stylish, from the Land Rover Range Rover to the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. Those who want their SUVs to flaunt their wealth have much better choices.\n\nInterior\nThis is going to be tough to explain. How do you tell readers that an SUV with a $74,700 base price just isn’t “nice enough” inside to warrant that sum? Well, it starts with the dashboard. The same thing is true in Lexus’ large sedan, the LS 460, whose dashboard isn’t of significantly better quality than its much-lower-priced ES 350 sibling. While the plastic buttons in the LX 570 are nicer than those in a Chevy Tahoe, there is no elegance like you’d find on the interface in a Mercedes, or even the rugged take on ergonomic controls that the Range Rover exhibits. The LX 570’s gauges are also quite boring, with simple numerals and blue and white lighting. They’re legible, but they’re also about as luxurious as the gauges in a Honda Civic.\n\nThe surfaces on the doors and dash are also not up to the level of luxury you’d expect at this price. They’re not bad, per se, and I’d rave about them if this were a $50,000 SUV, but for this price I expect more attention to detail. The saving grace of the interior is the comfort of the leather seats. The front seats are large and accommodating for any size frame. The seating position is relatively straight up, but it doesn’t have that “bus driver” vibe like you’ll often get in a minivan.\n\nPerformance\nThere’s one chief expectation drivers have when hopping into most Lexus vehicles — that it will have a quiet, comfortable ride. That is indeed the case with the LX 570. Despite giving this SUV a powerful engine, Lexus knows what its buyers want: They want to ride on a magic carpet.\n\nOK, that might be an exaggeration, but Lexus knows that isolation — in terms of lessening road and wind noise, vibration, and, yes, even that powerful engine’s note — is what is expected. For its immense size and blocky shape, the LX travels at high speeds with little wind noise. Road noise is muted, though it still intrudes slightly, mostly due to the large 20-inch wheels and tires. The engine is nearly silent unless the gas pedal is hammered on.\n\nWhen you do stretch that right foot, the 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 awakens and launches the SUV down the highway. Passing isn’t a concern here. Even with all that power, the LX is always refined, thanks to the six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThere’s no escaping how tall the LX is, though. Anything this top-heavy is going to lean in turns, especially on steep highway off-ramps. That’s just one of the tradeoffs when you drive a large SUV like this.\n\nBecause you can’t really compare the handling of large SUVs to that of cars, I always try to figure out how easy it is to navigate beasts like these in real-world driving. Parking ease, making tight turns and judging where the corners are is of paramount importance. Being able to test these things in a large city like Chicago comes in handy.\n\nI park off a narrow alley behind my three-flat in a tandem parking spot. That means I have to make a tight left turn into the spot behind my wife’s car. It was easy to squeeze the LX 570 into the spot. The Range Rover I drove a few weeks earlier wasn’t nearly as good in this regard. I had to get out of the Range Rover a few times to check my parking job. I just couldn’t tell where the heck the corners were. In the LX 570, there was no question. I usually only had to make one correcting move, which is true of most cars I test.\n\nThen there are the potholes. I told my wife that the LX 570 is actually the perfect city car because it swallows potholes and spits them out without complaint. On the roughest of Chicago’s pothole-littered streets, the LX 570 was still composed; the suspension handled the jolts without making the cabin shake or even mildly jostle. I can’t recall any car or SUV I’ve tested that was this good on imperfect roads.\n\nHowever, if the engine is still the most important performance component to you, you can tell people the LX 570 has more horsepower than the V-8s in the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Range Rover. It even beats the Mercedes-Benz GL550 by 1 hp. Only the Cadillac Escalade’s V-8 has significantly more power, at 403 hp. I will say the Escalade is more fun to drive, but it’s nowhere near as comfortable.\n\nCargo & Seating\nOne of the unique things about the LX 570 compared to other three-row SUVs is that the third row folds sideways, up to the side of the car instead of down into the floor. This is an odd setup even when it’s executed well, as it is here. By folding the seats up against the rear windows, you theoretically reduce visibility. I didn’t really notice the reduction in my own driving, but shorter drivers might.\n\nYou would think the resulting cargo area would be smaller than with other setups because of the big, bulky seats, but the space is so vast it never became an issue. What I didn’t like was the split opening in back, with its larger upper liftgate and smaller flip-down tailgate. This clamshell setup is used in some Land Rovers as well. I dislike it in almost every application. While there may be times you want to reach down into the cargo area, the LX 570 is so far off the ground it wasn’t comfortable for me to do so, and I’m 5-foot-10. Also, because of its high load height, it’s a pain to put luggage in the back.\n\nHowever, it does hold a lot of luggage. When two Cars.com staffers joined me for a road trip, our luggage and computer gear all fit with plenty of room to spare. We even served as a shuttle at an event, fitting four folks and all of their luggage just fine. Cargo volume for the LX 570 versus the Mercedes-Benz GL550 is almost identical, at 83.1 cubic feet and 83.3 cubic feet, respectively with both the second and third rows folded flat.\n\nWith the third row in place, space is obviously smaller, but it’s still competitive for the segment. Comfort in the third row is also about average. I’ve yet to be extremely comfortable in a third row, and I thought maybe this would be the one. Alas, it wasn’t. I especially wouldn’t want to be the one in the middle of the third row.\n\nOff-Road & Towing\nThe LX 570 is a very capable off-roader with full-time four-wheel drive and a two-speed transfer case. The specs say it has a maximum trailering capacity of 8,500 pounds, yet it doesn’t offer a dedicated tow or haul mode. Still, it should be plenty capable of towing a boat. I expect 90 percent of LX 570 buyers will never even see gravel, let alone a true offroad trail.\n\nFeatures\nAs you would expect from such an expensive SUV, most features come standard. These include leather seats, real wood trim, a navigation system, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, four-zone climate control, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a moonroof, power-folding side mirrors, power-folding third-row seats, a power-sliding second row, illuminated scuff plates and rain-sensitive windshield wipers.\n\nHeated and cooled front seats and a heated second row are an additional $890; they’re often standard on cars this expensive. Park Assist is $1,000, and a rear-seat entertainment system with wireless headphones is $1,990. A Technology Package with a 19-speaker sound system, hard disk drive and a six-CD/DVD changer goes for $4,200.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend the sound system at any price. I like a good stereo, and with 19 speakers I expected a lot more from Lexus’ system. The sound was tinny, with too much treble. Rock music did not sound robust, and bass-heavy tunes were anemically powered. Even talk radio was hard to hear unless turned up very loud. The optional system in a Ford Focus compact car sounds better than this unit; asking $4,200 for it is ludicrous.\n\nSafety\nThe LX 570 has all the safety features you’d expect in a vehicle of this class. Obviously there’s the standard front airbags, as well as seat-mounted side airbags for both the first and second rows. Side curtain airbags protect all three rows.\n\nStability control is also standard. As of this writing, the LX 570 hasn’t been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nLX 570 in the Market\nThere isn’t a big market for $75,000 SUVs. Only a few exist, and the LX 570 certainly attempts to prove it’s worth all that cash. Perhaps in some ways it is, but there are a few luxury three-row SUVs that cost less and deliver a more luxurious-feeling interior, like the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GL450, the GL550’s less-powerful sibling. The Cadillac Escalade is a bargain in this bunch, too, but it isn’t as nice inside. Even the overlooked Mercedes R-Class crossover offers a nice alternative for buyers only interested in carting the family around, and it costs about $20,000 less.\n\nBut the LX 570 competes directly with just the Range Rover and GL550, and the Range Rover doesn’t have three rows of seats. That leaves the GL550 and LX 570 going head-to-head. For the driving experience, you’d have to take the LX 570. For the luxury and looks, the winner is the GL550. How do you want to spend your $75,000?\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Lexus LX 570 is a vehicle of extremes. It’s the biggest Lexus on the road, and it has a massive V-8 engine to go with it. It also has tons of cupholders, stereo speakers, air vents, ride-control options, safety features and road presence. It goes through gas like there’s an endless supply of the stuff. This luxury SUV is not fooling around.\n\nI had a split reaction to the LX 570. The kid in me, who’s a materialistic, fun-loving speed demon, loved it. I loved pushing all the buttons and listening to the engine’s roar as it hauled its massive body up the steep hills of my neighborhood. I loved knowing that I had room enough for the most outrageous carpool –  this SUV can carry eight people – or even the most irresponsible of shopping sprees. It was just fun. However, the mature, eco-conscious killjoy of a practical parent in me just winced at the excess of it all. The adjustable ground clearance and four-wheel-drive crawl control system was wasted on my suburban roads. And the price tag? My test car, which had the Luxury Package, cost $83,860. The LX 570 starts at $76,905. This is not my idea of economical.\n\nThough the all-wheel-drive LX is based on the Toyota Sequoia, the ride is all Lexus, with a three-mode adaptive suspension. The LX 570 doesn’t drive like a truck or a bus, which is what I expected. While there’s virtually no road feel, there’s also little roly-poly heaviness in the turns. I was comfortable tackling twisty roads and poorly maintained highways in this full-size SUV. The only place I didn’t enjoy driving the LX was in tight parking lots because of its gigantic size. The LX 570 has plenty of power to haul its bulk around, plus anything you’d like to tow up to 8,500 pounds.\n \nEXTERIOR\n\nFor its gigantic size, the LX 570 isn’t particularly stylish or exciting looking. It’s a huge, rounded-off square of an SUV, with a piggy snout and bulgy rear that don’t add any sleekness to the LX. The huge headlights, situated at the far corners of the front, manage to dwarf the chrome grille. Without any hard edges, this SUV manages to look soft. In spite of all that the LX looks big and expensive, which, I’m sure, was the Lexus’ goal. Mission accomplished.\n\nThe LX has Active Height Control, which allows you to choose one of three ride heights with the push of a button. It also has an automatic setting that drops the LX to its lowest ride height when you turn the SUV off. This made getting in and out of it much easier. It’s also kind of like an amusement park ride. I couldn’t stop playing with it. Up! Down! Wheeee! Getting in and out of the LX was also easy because of its big, wide-swinging doors, which somehow weren’t too heavy for my kiddos to manage. The running boards doors helped them out, too. They also made access to the third row less of a struggle.\n\nThe rear cargo door is split into a power liftgate and a manual tailgate. Rather than mess with the tailgate, I mostly just pushed the button to open the upper liftgate. I had to lift groceries and luggage over the closed tailgate, but I considered it a shoulder workout.\n\nThe LX 570 has a 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 engine and gets 12/18 mpg city/highway. With that poor gas mileage, you’ll be frequently stopping at the gas station where you’ll have to buy premium gas for this luxury SUV. Ouch.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nIf I wasn’t wild about the exterior looks of the LX 570, the interior comfort made it up to me. Huge, soft leather seats embraced me with heat or air conditioning, which is optional, at the touch of a button. While I reveled in the luxury of a warmed or cooled tushy, the perforated seats that provided such comfort also collected crumbs and mystery grunge. Those are the trade-offs, I guess.\n\nWarm wood trim softened the cool gray tones of the dashboard. A recessed rubberized pad held my iPhone, while the Bluetooth connectivity not only made the phone functions hands-free but streamed my music almost magically. My only beef with the audio system was the volume seemed to move in such small increments that I felt like I was cranking the volume just to hear the lyrics.\n\nI also could have used more storage in the front seat. The center console bin is cooled and insulated, but it’s on the small side. While that’s certainly a nifty feature, I never turned it on. I’d rather have someplace to stash my baby wipes and crayons. In the LX, I usually just tossed everything on the front passenger seat, which makes for a mad scramble whenever another adult tries to climb in.\n\nI find Lexus’ center stack to be clumsy and hard to use. The touch-screen is at its center and requires the driver to look away from the road to do anything. Options fade in and out as the car comes to a stop and begins to move again, and some functions seem to be voice control only, which is confusing. The voice-control system works well, but it’s slow and cumbersome, with long pauses between prompts and responses. I don’t think it liked me very much. I may have gotten snippy with it.\n\nIn the backseat, there’s plenty of room for three adults, three kids or three child-safety seats, but it’s virtually impossible to buckle the center seat belt. It’s much easier to toss that third or fourth kiddo in the third row. To get to the third row, second-row seats tumble forward easily, with a one-handed release. The second row’s power-sliding feature creates additional legroom for the third row when it’s in use.\n\nThere’s a large armrest that folds down in the second row, and it not only provides cupholders but a shallow storage bin, as well. This was great for stowing the optional rear entertainment system’s remote control and a couple of DVDs. In the third row, the kids were pretty comfortable, but adults might find it a tight fit. I could sit back there, but I wouldn’t want to for very long. There are also cupholders and a storage bin below the windows in the third row.\n\nLexus has stayed with its odd folding mechanism, which folds the back of the seats downward and then lifts the whole seat up toward the sides of the car. This is made fairly painless by a power-folding function, but it still impedes rear visibility. I’d rather see the seats fold into the floor.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nIn the three-row LX 570, there are only two sets of lower Latch anchors. They’re located in the outboard seats in the second row and hidden behind small leather flaps that are held in place with Velcro. Once the flap is down, they’re easy to access, and there’s no digging or searching for the anchors.\n\nInstalling car seats is a breeze, thanks to the wide, flat seats that accommodate a variety of styles. On the downside, hoisting heavy car seats up into the LX 570 might be a back injury waiting to happen. Suddenly, the Active Height Control looks less ridiculous.\n\nThe LX 570 comes with standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, active front head restraints, an electronic stability system with traction control, all-wheel drive, a backup camera and 10 airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front and second rows, knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side curtains for all three rows. It also has adaptive headlights, which swivel around curves as the driver turns the steering wheel. Each light swivels independently, based upon the degree of the turn, the speed of the vehicle and math I won’t pretend to understand.\n\nOptional safety features on the LX 570 include a Pre-Collision System with adaptive cruise control ($1,500). This system uses radar to gauge the distance between the LX and other vehicles in front of it and maintains one of three following distances using both the throttle and the brakes. Freeway driving becomes close to painless because of this feature. This same system determines when a collision is imminent – even when the cruise control is off – and it primes all the safety systems to prepare for a crash.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Lexus LX 570 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2014 about the 2014 Lexus LX 570. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Lexus LX 570 needs a giant leap to stay competitive in a class of more modern three-row luxury SUVs.\n\nThe LX 570 isn’t offensively outdated, but once you step into an Infiniti QX80, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class or Land Rover Range Rover Sport — the latter newly available with a third row — the LX 570’s $83,540 price (including a $910 destination charge) will be harder to fork over.\n\nThe eight-seat LX 570’s interior hasn’t been overhauled since the SUV’s last full redesign, for the 2008 model year, and it shows in design and usefulness. Very few cars can stand the test of that much time without an intervention. Compare the LX 570 with its competitors here.\n\nThe LX 570 continues to excel on the road, however, with buttery smooth ride quality and a refined engine and transmission. Off the road, the LX 570 is deceivingly go-anywhere ready with genuine off-road hardware. Restyled for 2013, the LX 570 skipped 2012, so compare the 2011 to the 2013 and 2014 here.\n\nStyling\nStarting with the 2013 model year, the LX 570 wears Lexus’ hourglass “spindle” grille. The grille treatment varies from mild to wild across the Lexus lineup, but it looks just right on the LX 570. Though the 2013 styling update brought LED daytime running lamps, new headlights and larger fog light bezels, the LX 570’s shape behind the grille is unchanged and fairly generic compared with the curvaceous QX80, the long and low GL-Class and the devilish Range Rover Sport.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe honkin’ 383-horsepower V-8 engine, six-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive comprise the LX 570’s only drivetrain, so gas mileage is take it or leave it at 12/17/14 mpg city/highway/combined. Fuel economy isn’t likely a top priority for any shopper eyeballing a 6,000-pound, off-road-capable, three-row luxury SUV. Still, shoppers can choose a more-efficient diesel engine in the GL350 (19/26/22 mpg) or a supercharged V-6 in the Range Rover (17/23/19 mpg) in addition to V-8 options from both. The LX 570 burns through gas like it has a personal vendetta against your wallet. I observed 15.9 mpg driving 294 miles from the Chicago suburbs to Detroit, averaging 66 mph. It’s otherwise a great road-tripper, though, with a comfortable ride, a great seating position and sofa-like front seats.\n\nThe 5.7-liter V-8 is a gem of an engine that hauls the massive SUV effortlessly. It’s quiet and refined, yet potent enough to never leave you wanting more power. A six-speed automatic transmission with smart programming never skips a beat with the V-8. Getting that power to the ground is a full-time four-wheel-drive system with a 40:60 torque split between the front and rear wheels; the rear bias helps agility during normal driving.\n\nA center differential distributes torque on demand between the front and rear wheels and is lockable for challenging weather or off-road conditions. A selectable Low-range gear is part of the package, which works in conjunction with the standard adjustable-height suspension to raise ground clearance by 2 inches to clear off-road obstacles. Selectable terrain modes for Rock & Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock or Mud & Sand tailor driving characteristics to each road condition.\n\nThe LX is surprisingly agile in tight spaces, though I did observe front wheel chatter on occasion. Ride quality is top-notch considering the traditional body-on-frame chassis. The suspension is anything but traditional, with adaptive and height-adjustable characteristics. Potholes or abandoned compact cars are no problem for the LX 570 to roll over, with little indication the road surface changed. (No compact cars were injured in the making of this review.) Comfort, Normal and Sport modes adjust the suspension’s firmness, and I found the best ride quality in Comfort and kept it there; there’s no need for the LX 570 to be driven sportily.\n\nEven in Sport mode there was undesirable body roll and body motion in corners; more so than a Range Rover Sport or a QX80 with the optional Hydraulic Body Motion Control. The LX 570 doesn’t hide its 6,000-pound curb weight, and it feels every bit as massive as it looks. You know you’re slinging around a lot of weight when you drive this SUV, unlike the QX80 and Range Rover Sport’s more carlike rides.\n\nThe LX 570’s 7,000-pound tow rating comes up short against the GL-Class’ 7,500-pound rating, the QX80’s 8,500-pound rating and even the considerably lighter Range Rover Sport’s 7,716-pound trailer rating.\n\nInterior\nFor those who want a tall seating position and accompanying commanding view of the road, the LX 570’s elevated view from the cockpit is practically what the pilot of a low-flying Cessna sees. You’ll never lose the LX 570 in a parking lot, as it towers over everything around. An extremely tall seating position doesn’t mean the LX 570 is difficult to step into thanks to an adjustable height suspension that can lower the ride height automatically when the ignition is turned off for easy access.\n\nBesides the tall seating position, other interior high points include the nicely appointed leather seating surfaces and various leather trimmings with contrast stitching that fit together impeccably. Our test vehicle wore the optional semi-aniline leather trim that’s part of a $1,510 Luxury Package, which also includes a heated steering wheel, cooled front seats, mahogany wood trim and a beverage-chilling Cool Box. Despite the top-notch leather and build quality, the interior shows signs of aging. The silver highlights around the center console, climate vents and gear selector reek of old Lexus — not as modern-looking as Lexus’ recently redesigned products like the GS or IS line of sedans.\n\nThe overall design is aging, though not as badly as I expected from a six- to seven-year-old interior. Switches, buttons and the off-road system’s toggle gear are the LX’s tell that it’s not quite the spring chicken any longer. Other SUVs, like the QX and GL-Class, have taken an almost carlike approach to interiors, and you’d be hard-pressed to distinguish them from each automaker’s sedans. Conversely, the LX is clearly an SUV, with a tall, vertical and wide center control panel. Bottom line: You’re not getting Lexus’ most modern and attractive offering like you would from the other brands mentioned.\n\nBoth the first and second rows are exceptionally comfortable, with supple cushioning that pairs well with the SUV’s soft ride quality. Considering the SUV’s size, though, I expected more than 34.4 inches of legroom from the three-passenger second row, and I didn’t have a lot of extra room to unwind like I did in the QX80 (41 inches) we tested at the same time. Comfort in the LX’s three-passenger third row is about even with the QX80’s third row, but the Infiniti’s third row is much easier to access.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe first step I take in any late-model Lexus is to turn off the “Auto screen” feature within the depths of the Lexus Enform system. Auto screen automatically reverts to a default display after sitting idle, rather than staying on the radio or media display. The LX’s Enform multimedia system uses a touch-screen and real buttons for controlling navigation, stereo and climate systems, as opposed to Lexus’ mouse-style controller, a multi-function knob or capacitive buttons. It works well, with the exception that the display is borderline too far away for a touch-screen.\n\nStandard features include navigation; in-car apps for Pandora, Bing, Yelp and more; USB/iPod, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio; HD radio with iTunes tagging; and satellite radio with a 90-day free trial subscription. An available Mark Levinson stereo bumps the speaker count from nine to 19 and includes an in-dash six-CD player, though I wasn’t blown away by the $2,350 option. I also wanted somewhere to put phones and music players to match the generous range of connectivity. There isn’t much room besides the two cupholders and a shallow pad to store devices.\n\nMy LX 570 tester was priced at $88,555 including a $910 destination charge, stereo and other options like a rear-seat DVD player and Lexus’ Luxury Package. One feature I could do without was the Cool Box in the storage area between the front seats. It attempts to keep the items in the box cool with air from the air conditioning system, and it didn’t work very well on my five-hour road trip. It works only when the engine is running, so it doesn’t even have the benefits of a cooler.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSecond- and third-row versatility is another sign of the LX’s age. The second row’s power sliding and tumbling feature isn’t as seamless as Infiniti’s QX80, whose one-touch motion is so easy it’s doable with one finger.\n\nThe LX’s 50/50-split, power-operated third row doesn’t fold down, but rather up. Each split seat folds up to the passenger and driver side of the rear cargo area, but it’s slow and bulky, and even when the seatbacks are folded down for both rows they don’t create a flat load floor like the QX80 does; they’re elevated about a foot off the main cargo floor. Maximum cargo capacity is 83.1 cubic feet, which is short of the QX80’s 95.1 cubic feet and the GL-Class’ 93.8 cubic feet, but it’s a lot larger than the Range Rover Sport’s 62.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo space.\n\nOut back is a clamshell-style hatch with a bottom section that folds down like a pickup truck’s tailgate and a top half that opens like a regular liftgate. This style has been exiting the mainstream for a while, and I’m not convinced it should be around any longer considering the extra reach it takes to place items in the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nThe LX 570 has not been crash-tested.\n\nOne of the biggest oversights in our tester was a lack of parking assists. The backup camera isn’t enough by itself to make parking the huge LX 570 a confidence-inspiring experience. The driver’s significant other should prepare to get out and spot if the buyer doesn’t choose the $1,000 Intuitive Park Assist with front and rear cameras and parking sensors. Infiniti’s base QX80 is more than $20,000 less expensive and includes the company’s great Around View Monitor, a top-down camera system with front and rear sonar parking sensors, standard, which makes parking the equally massive QX80 as easy as parking a midsize sedan compared with the LX 570.\n\nThe LX’s standard safety equipment includes side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating. Adaptive front lighting illuminates corners as it turns with the steering angle, and rain-sensing wipers are also standard, along with Entune’s Safety Connect with automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle locator and an emergency assist button. See here for more safety equipment.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the LX 570 in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nLexus doesn’t churn out many LX 570s; it was the luxury automaker’s lowest-volume model in 2013 — besides the LFA supercar and the discontinued HS — selling 4,625 units. The QX80 sold 13,148 and the GL-Class raked in 29,912 sales. Low sales don’t always indicate an underperformer, but there are more features and fuel economy for the money in the three-row luxury SUV competition from Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz and Land Rover.\n\nThe aging LX 570 sits on a great platform for comfort and off-road capability, and a redesign could take everything we like about Lexus’ more modern models and make a much more competitive luxury three-row SUV.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Lexus LX 570 needs a giant leap to stay competitive in a class of more modern three-row luxury SUVs.\n\nThe LX 570 isn’t offensively outdated, but once you step into an Infiniti QX80, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class or Land Rover Range Rover Sport — the latter newly available with a third row — the Toyota-like feel of the LX 570’s $83,540 price (including a $910 destination charge) will be harder to fork over.\n\nThe eight-seat LX 570’s interior hasn’t been overhauled since the SUV’s last full redesign, for the 2008 model year, and it shows in design and usefulness. Very few cars can stand the test of that much time without an intervention. Compare the LX 570 with its competitors here.\n\nThe Lexus LX 570 continues to excel on the road, however, with buttery smooth ride quality and a refined engine and transmission. Off the road, the LX 570 is deceivingly go-anywhere ready with genuine off-road hardware. Restyled for 2013, the LX 570 skipped 2012, so compare the 2011 to the 2013 and 2014 here.\n\nStyling\nStarting with the 2013 model year, the LX 570 wears Lexus’ hourglass “spindle” grille. The grille treatment varies from mild to wild across the Lexus lineup, but it looks just right on the LX 570. Though the 2013 styling update brought LED daytime running lamps, new headlights and larger fog light bezels, the LX 570’s shape behind the grille is unchanged and fairly generic compared with the curvaceous QX80, the long and low GL-Class and the devilish Range Rover Sport.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe honkin’ 383-horsepower V-8 engine, six-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive comprise the LX 570’s only drivetrain, so gas mileage is take it or leave it at 12/17/14 mpg city/highway/combined. Fuel economy isn’t likely a top priority for any shopper eyeballing a 6,000-pound, off-road-capable, three-row luxury SUV. Still, shoppers can choose a more-efficient diesel engine in the GL350 (19/26/22 mpg) or a supercharged V-6 in the Range Rover (17/23/19 mpg) in addition to V-8 options from both. The LX 570 burns through gas like it has a personal vendetta against your wallet. I observed 15.9 mpg driving 294 miles from the Chicago suburbs to Detroit, averaging 66 mph. It’s otherwise a great road-tripper, though, with a comfortable ride, a great seating position and sofa-like front seats.\n\nThe 5.7-liter V-8 is a gem of an engine that hauls the massive SUV effortlessly. It’s quiet and refined, yet potent enough to never leave you wanting more power. A six-speed automatic transmission with smart programming never skips a beat with the V-8. Getting that power to the ground is a full-time four-wheel-drive system with a 40:60 torque split between the front and rear wheels; the rear bias helps agility during normal driving.\n\nA center differential distributes torque on demand between the front and rear wheels and is lockable for challenging weather or off-road conditions. A selectable Low-range gear is part of the package, which works in conjunction with the standard adjustable-height suspension to raise ground clearance by 2 inches to clear off-road obstacles. Selectable terrain modes for Rock & Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock or Mud & Sand tailor driving characteristics to each road condition.\n\nThe LX is surprisingly agile in tight spaces, though I did observe front wheel chatter on occasion. Ride quality is top-notch considering the traditional body-on-frame chassis. The suspension is anything but traditional, with adaptive and height-adjustable characteristics. Potholes or abandoned compact cars are no problem for the Lexus LX 570 to roll over, with little indication the road surface changed. (No compact cars were injured in the making of this review.) Comfort, Normal and Sport modes adjust the suspension’s firmness, and I found the best ride quality in Comfort and kept it there; there’s no need for the LX 570 to be driven sportily.\n\nEven in Sport mode there was undesirable body roll and body motion in corners; more so than similar body types, such as a Range Rover Sport or a QX80 with the optional Hydraulic Body Motion Control. The Lexus LX 570 doesn’t hide its 6,000-pound curb weight, and it feels every bit as massive as it looks. You know you’re slinging around a lot of weight when you drive this SUV, unlike the QX80 and Range Rover Sport’s more carlike rides.\n\nThe LX 570’s 7,000-pound tow rating comes up short against the GL-Class’ 7,500-pound rating, the QX80’s 8,500-pound rating and even the considerably lighter Range Rover Sport’s 7,716-pound trailer rating.\n\nInterior\nFor those who want a tall seating position and accompanying commanding view of the road, the LX 570’s elevated view from the cockpit is practically what the pilot of a low-flying Cessna sees. You’ll never lose the LX 570 in a parking lot, as it towers over everything around. An extremely tall seating position doesn’t mean the LX 570 is difficult to step into thanks to an adjustable height suspension that can lower the ride height automatically when the ignition is turned off for easy access.\n\nBesides the tall seating position, other interior high points include the nicely appointed leather seating surfaces and various leather trimmings with contrast stitching that fit together impeccably. Our test vehicle wore the optional semi-aniline leather trim that’s part of a $1,510 Luxury Package, which also includes a heated steering wheel, cooled front seats, mahogany wood trim and a beverage-chilling Cool Box. Despite the top-notch leather seats and build quality, the interior shows signs of aging. The silver highlights around the center console, climate vents and gear selector reek of old Lexus — not as modern-looking as Lexus’ recently redesigned products like the GS or IS line of sedans.\n\nThe overall design is aging, though not as badly as I expected from a six- to seven-year-old interior. Switches, buttons and the off-road system’s toggle gear are the LX’s tell that it’s not quite the spring chicken any longer. Other SUVs, like the QX and GL-Class, have taken an almost carlike approach to interiors, and you’d be hard-pressed to distinguish them from each automaker’s sedans. Conversely, the LX is clearly an SUV, with a tall, vertical and wide center control panel. Bottom line: You’re not getting Lexus’ most modern and attractive offering like you would from the other brands mentioned.\n\nBoth the first and second rows are exceptionally comfortable, with supple cushioning that pairs well with the SUV’s soft ride quality. Considering the SUV’s size, though, I expected more than 34.4 inches of legroom from the three-passenger second row, and I didn’t have a lot of extra room to unwind like I did in the QX80 (41 inches) we tested at the same time. Comfort in the LX’s three-passenger third row is about even with the QX80’s third row, but the Infiniti’s third row is much easier to access.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe first step I take in any late-model Lexus is to turn off the “Auto screen” feature within the depths of the Lexus Enform system. Auto screen automatically reverts to a default display after sitting idle, rather than staying on the radio or media display. The LX’s Enform multimedia system uses a touch-screen and real buttons for controlling navigation, stereo and climate systems, as opposed to Lexus’ mouse-style controller, a multi-function knob or capacitive buttons. It works well, with the exception that the display is borderline too far away for a touch-screen.\n\nStandard features include navigation; in-car apps for Pandora, Bing, Yelp and more; USB/iPod, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio; HD radio with iTunes tagging; and satellite radio with a 90-day free trial subscription. An available Mark Levinson stereo bumps the speaker count from nine to 19 and includes an in-dash six-CD player, though I wasn’t blown away by the $2,350 option. I also wanted somewhere to put phones and music players to match the generous range of connectivity. There isn’t much room besides the two cupholders and a shallow pad to store devices.\n\nMy Lexus LX 570 tester was priced at $88,555 including a $910 destination charge, stereo and other options like a rear-seat DVD player and Lexus’ Luxury Package. One feature I could do without was the Cool Box in the storage area between the front seats. It attempts to keep the items in the box cool with air from the air conditioning system, and it didn’t work very well on my five-hour road trip. It works only when the engine is running, so it doesn’t even have the benefits of a cooler.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSecond- and third-row versatility is another sign of the LX’s age. The second row’s power sliding and tumbling feature isn’t as seamless as Infiniti’s QX80, whose one-touch motion is so easy it’s doable with one finger.\n\nThe LX’s 50/50-split, power-operated third row doesn’t fold down, but rather up. Each split seat folds up to the passenger and driver side of the rear cargo area, but it’s slow and bulky, and even when the seatbacks are folded down for both rows they don’t create a flat load floor like the QX80 does; they’re elevated about a foot off the main cargo floor. Maximum cargo capacity is 83.1 cubic feet, which is short of the QX80’s 95.1 cubic feet and the GL-Class’ 93.8 cubic feet, but it’s a lot larger than the Range Rover Sport’s 62.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo space.\n\nOut back is a clamshell-style hatch with a bottom section that folds down like a pickup truck’s tailgate and a top half that opens like a regular liftgate. This style has been exiting the mainstream for a while, and I’m not convinced it should be around any longer considering the extra reach it takes to place items in the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nThe Lexus LX 570 has not been crash-tested.\n\nOne of the biggest oversights in our tester was a lack of parking assists. The backup camera isn’t enough by itself to make parking the huge LX 570 a confidence-inspiring experience. The driver’s significant other should prepare to get out and spot if the buyer doesn’t choose the $1,000 Intuitive Park Assist with front and rear cameras and parking sensors. Infiniti’s base QX80 is more than $20,000 less expensive and includes the company’s great Around View Monitor, a top-down camera system with front and rear sonar parking sensors, standard, which makes parking the equally massive QX80 as easy as parking a midsize sedan compared with the LX 570.\n\nThe LX’s standard safety equipment includes side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating. Adaptive front lighting illuminates corners as it turns with the steering angle, and rain-sensing wipers are also standard, along with Entune’s Safety Connect with automatic pre-collision notification, stolen vehicle locator and an emergency assist button. See here for more safety equipment.\n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the LX 570 in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nLexus doesn’t churn out many LexusLX 570s; it was the luxury automaker’s lowest-volume model in 2013 — besides the LFA supercar and the discontinued HS — selling 4,625 units. The QX80 sold 13,148 and the GL-Class raked in 29,912 sales. Low sales don’t always indicate an underperformer, but there are more features and fuel economy for the money in the three-row luxury SUV competition from Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz and Land Rover.\n\nThe aging Lexus LX 570 sits on a great platform for comfort and off-road capability, and a redesign could take everything we like about Lexus’ more modern models and make a much more competitive luxury three-row SUV.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Lexus LX570 was written in September 2016, but little has changed for 2017. Click here to see what’s new for 2017, or click here for a comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Lexus LX 570 is the flagship SUV of Toyota’s luxury brand and a rarity on American roads. Lexus doesn’t sell many of these battlewagons, and for good reason: They’re extremely expensive. \n\nBuilt off the Toyota Land Cruiser and sharing that SUV’s many, highly capable electronic 4×4 systems, the LX 570 represents an upgrade of sorts. It can do everything the already expensive and luxurious Land Cruiser can do (and arguably more, thanks to its air suspension), but does so while swaddling passengers in a cocoon of leather, wood and sound insulation.\n\nThe LX received a refresh for 2016 (compare it with the outgoing 2015 model here), gaining new styling, a new transmission, a new multimedia system, some interior refinements and a bunch of new electronic safety systems. The price has gone up a hair, as well. But with the Toyota Land Cruiser’s price landing within just a few thousand dollars of the fancier Lexus, the question becomes: Is the LX different enough to justify paying even more?\n\nStyling & Exterior\n\nOn some Lexus models, the new spindle grille and Nike-swoosh headlights work. On others, like on the LX 570, they look like the angry helmet from a Battlestar Galactica Cylon robot. With the long overhangs, relatively short wheelbase and styling that doesn’t know when to quit, it just has to be said: The LX is a special kind of ugly. \n\nYou can’t fault Lexus for making it distinctive, but the Toyota Land Cruiser is a far more attractive, elegant and clean-looking design. I guess when one isn’t terribly worried about fuel economy, one can do crazy things with slats, creases, folds, grilles and strakes — and Lexus certainly has. \n\nYou’re not likely to mistake the LX 570 for anything else on the road, except perhaps the Infiniti QX80, which somehow manages to be equally odd-looking. The Cadillac Escalade, by comparison, is oversized but elegant, with sharp creases and clean lines, while the newly refreshed 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class successfully brings the S-Class sedan’s sweeping lines to a more upright vehicle. Anything from Land Rover is better-looking, as well. It just didn’t need to look like this, Lexus.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYour first clue that this is an old-school SUV is the short wheelbase and big overhangs at the front and rear. The second clue is the way it drives, which is slow and ponderous. It feels like a heavy truck because it is. Though smaller than the Escalade, GLS or QX80, at 6,000 pounds it’s the heaviest of the four. Combine that with the least-powerful engine in the group — a 383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 — and you have an SUV with lazy around-town acceleration and a general distaste for changing directions quickly. The LX 570 isn’t underpowered, but it’s tuned toward relaxed responses: acceleration is only moderate unless you really plant your foot, gear shifts are smooth but come early, and the steering behavior is slow and highly boosted. \n\nHighway travel is subdued and stress-free, unless you happen to be driving through a windy environment, where crosswinds play havoc with the Lexus’ straight-line stability. The LX 570’s air suspension provides for a remarkably smooth and quiet ride, and it can also be set to automatically lower the truck when parked and keyed off, which is helpful when it comes to getting in and out of the tall SUV. \n\nBraking performance is also strong, with a firm pedal that brings the heavy truck to a halt with confidence. \n\nThe LX 570 has a host of electronic four-wheel-drive features that reportedly make it quite the mountain goat in rough stuff, but the idea of going off-road anywhere but the fields of the local polo club in an SUV this big and expensive seems unlikely. \n\nAll-wheel drive is provided via a Torsen limited-slip center differential that can be locked by the driver. A Multi-Terrain Select system then allows the driver to choose a setting for the all-wheel-drive system that matches the environment: Rock, Rock and Dirt, Moguls, Loose Rock, or Mud and Sand. A low range is also available for serious off-roading, as is the electronic Crawl Control that’s been so ably demonstrated on other Toyota SUVs. But all its fancy plastic cladding will still limit the LX’s abilities over more challenging terrain.\n\nThe LX 570’s competitors all feature luxurious, quiet motoring experiences similar to the Lexus, but they all feel nimbler and quicker. The new Mercedes-Benz GLS offers four powertrains, but in price and equipment, the GLS550 matches up best with the LX 570 thanks to its 449-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.7-liter V-8 and nine-speed automatic transmission. The Cadillac Escalade Platinum also compares favorably, with its enormous 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic. Even the Infiniti QX80 outguns the LX with its 400-hp, 5.6-liter V-8, but it makes do with just a seven-speed automatic. \n\nThe LX 570 is the heaviest of this group and possesses the aerodynamics of an apartment building, and it shows at the pump. Its gas mileage is rated 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined, and it delivers on that rating; my week in the LX included a jaunt from Detroit to Toronto during which I netted 15 mpg overall. That’s about the same as the four-wheel-drive Infiniti QX80, which is rated 13/19/15 mpg, but the Mercedes-Benz GLS550 is rated slightly better, at 14/18/16 mpg. Topping them all, surprisingly, is the biggest truck with the biggest engine: The four-wheel-drive Cadillac Escalade is rated 15/21/17 mpg, which still isn’t very good.\n\nInterior\n\nI once criticized the Toyota Land Cruiser for being an excellent $50,000 SUV that costs $80,000, and a big reason for that was its plain, if well-built, interior. The Lexus comes a lot closer to being worth its price ($96,905 for the loaded version I drove) than the Toyota, with significant upgrades to the cabin that make it more competitive with other luxury SUVs. Real wood and lots of leather abound, but it’s more than just slapping on some expensive materials; the dash is completely different, as is the multimedia system. The second and third rows are both power-folding affairs instead of being manually manipulated, and gazing around the interior of the LX 570 is far more pleasant than beholding the SUV from the outside. \n\nThe interior is comfortable, too, with big seats up front that have standard heating and optional cooling. The second row has plenty of legroom and even a power sliding function, but the third row remains fit for children only due to a lack of legroom. Lexus says you can fit three abreast in the third row, but that would likely be three children. \n\nVisibility is good thanks to a high seating position and tall windows all around. But that same high seating position also makes for an unusual driving setup, with the steering wheel angled more horizontally than in newer SUVs — like that of a city bus or an RV. You get used to it, but it’s a little disconcerting at first. \n\nWhile the Lexus’ interior is upscale, it’s still outdone by the latest from Mercedes-Benz. The new 2017 GLS-Class also feels far more premium than the Infiniti QX80, and it gives the posh Cadillac Escalade (which is let down by touch-sensitive controls) a run for its money. \n\nAs for overall interior room, the Lexus is quite large. Only the Cadillac offers more passenger space, rated at 172 cubic feet versus the Lexus’ 159 cubic feet. The Infiniti is third, at 152 cubic feet, while the Mercedes-Benz is rather small, with only 144 cubic feet to play with inside.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe update to the LX brought a new multimedia system, which, sad to say, includes the reviled mouse-like controller we’ve come to hate in other Lexus products. To say that it’s hard to use and a massive distraction while driving is an understatement. Imagine trying to use a laptop and mouse on the center console while you’re driving 70 mph, or negotiating a busy city street. That’s essentially our impression of Lexus’ multimedia system; it’s in dire need of a rethink. When compared with the multidirectional knob in the Mercedes-Benz or even Cadillac’s touch-screen CUE system, the Lexus system falls well short of being competitive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered, either.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe LX 570 is a big truck, but its cargo area is compromised by the design of its third row. Like in the Land Cruiser, in order to store the third row the seatbacks must fold forward, then the split seats fold up against the sides of the cargo area. This leaves a decent space in the middle and plenty of height for larger items, but not much width. Cargo volume is rated 15.5 cubic feet behind the third row and is expandable to a maximum of 83.1 cubic feet. Most of these big, three-row SUVs have similar cargo room behind the third row, but the Lexus shows a deficiency in max room — the GLS comes with 93.8 cubic feet of total cargo space, the Escalade is expandable to 94.2 cubic feet and the Infiniti QX80 has 95.1 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 LX 570 has not yet been crash-tested, but results will be posted here if and when it is. \n\nThe LX has received a number of updates to its electronic safety systems for 2016, including the arrival of Lexus’ Safety System Plus, which now includes a pre-collision preparation system, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, all-speed dynamic cruise control, and an intelligent high-beam system for the headlights. A panoramic around-view camera and parking sensors are standard, but more advanced systems like forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are not available. See all the LX 570’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nLike the Toyota Land Cruiser, the fancier Lexus LX 570 does not come cheap, but nor does it need much added; almost everything comes standard. The LX 570’s base price is $89,830 including destination fee, and there are just a few options you can add, including a Mark Levinson 19-speaker audio system; a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system; a luxury package with upgraded leather, cooled front seats and heated second-row seats; and a head-up display. All those options brought my as-tested price up to $96,905.\n\nThere are several competitors in this price class, each with varying levels of off-road ability and luxury content. The Mercedes-Benz GLS550 is a solid competitor, featuring a more powerful twin-turbocharged V-8, a more luxurious interior, a better multimedia system and more interior cargo room than the LX 570. It can also tow more, with a maximum 7,500-pound trailer rating versus the Lexus’ 7,000-pound rating. \n\nThe Infiniti QX80 has a similar pedigree as the Lexus; it’s based on the Nissan Patrol SUV, which competes internationally with the Toyota Land Cruiser. Like the Lexus, the Infiniti has been considerably upgraded, with a much nicer interior, a powerful engine and a higher price, though it isn’t quite as dear as the Lexus’ sticker. \n\nThe Cadillac Escalade is one of the original big luxury SUVs, and in recent years its price has been creeping up, along with its sophistication. You can option one up to just shy of $100,000, but it’ll include features such as Cadillac’s outstanding Magnetic Ride Control suspension, a Driver Assist Package of safety tech including automatic emergency braking, a four-color head-up display and more.

      "expert_review": "Their modern designs make it easy to overlook the fact that Lexus and parent company Toyota make some of the most old-school vehicles around, including the legendary Toyota Land Cruiser and its luxurious counterpart, the Lexus LX 570.\n\nWhile most modern SUVs trend toward urban performance with car-based platforms and low-slung profiles, the Lexus LX 570 is a dinosaur from a different era. It has body-on-frame construction, high sides and upright styling that has little regard for aerodynamics, and it drives off-road with aplomb. That’s why it’s hard to find direct competitors for the LX 570 outside of Toyota’s Land Cruiser. The Land Rover Range Rover is one exception; it’s priced close to the LX and can go virtually anywhere despite having unibody construction.\n\nOther models that compete on size and/or price include the Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80 and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. Compare the LX 570 with those vehicles here.\n\nAs good as it may be on a trail, however, I don’t think that’s how most Lexus LX 570 buyers will end up using their big ute, so I set out to see if the old dog had any tricks on the highways and byways of Los Angeles.\n\nNew for 2018: Two-Row Version\n\nFor 2018, the one major change for the LX 570 is the addition of a two-row, five-seat version aimed at those who don’t need a third row and want to gain some cargo room. In the traditional Lexus LX 570, the third-row seats are more of an obstruction when stowed than in many vehicles because they fold up to the sides rather than down into the floor. That LX has eight seats in three rows, but only 44.7 cubic feet of cargo volume behind its second row. The two-row jumps up to 50.5 cubic feet, a 13 percent increase.\n\nThere’s more good news: The two-row version comes with a $5,000 price decrease and starts at $86,575, but it’s mono-spec, meaning there are no trim packages available for it. While the three-row is comparably equipped to start, you can add a luxury package (including perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front- and second-row seats, and a four-zone climate control system) and a rear-seat entertainment system that brings a pair of 11.6-inch screens.\n\nCompare the 2018 LX 570 with the 2017 model here.\n\nPowertrain\n\nThe Lexus LX 570 comes with an old-fashioned 5.7-liter V-8 that makes 383 horsepower and 403 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive that offers an additional low gear via a switch in the center console. Next to that is a control for Lexus’ impressive crawl-control system, which can be set to maintain a slow pace over rough terrain without the driver having to manipulate the pedals. This system is standard, along with an air suspension that offers a variety of ride heights. I’d recommend letting the suspension automatically do its own thing on the road; raising it too high on your own can negatively impact ride quality.\n\nOn the street, the LX 570 drives like a more refined version of a large truck. The ride is butter smooth over pavement, and though there’s some extra body roll in the corners, the Lexus LX 570 doesn’t feel sloppy; its suspension gets it back upright slowly rather than explosively. The V-8 gets the LX 570’s 5,800 pounds moving easily and — most importantly — pulls hard between 40 and 70 mph, so passing is a breeze.\n\nRoad and tire noise are well-controlled — more so than in other vehicles that ride on truck-based platforms. Fuel economy is, predictably, not a strong point: 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nLet’s start with the positives: Materials and fit and finish are big highlights in the LX 570. It feels the part of a nearly $90,000 luxury SUV, and even though tan leather isn’t particularly my style (I’d always be afraid of spills or stains), it was very impressive. The front seats are also exceptionally comfortable, and the Lexus LX 570 comes with a feature called Climate Concierge, which employs multiple sensors around the vehicle to control the ventilation system, heated and ventilated seats and heated steering wheel (if equipped) to either cool or warm the car more comfortably for occupants.\n\nWhen it comes to misses, two big ones stem from Lexus’ insistence on using a weird knoblike mouse controller for its infotainment systems and continuing to resist smartphone connectivity options (Android Auto and Apple CarPlay). Lexus is starting to change this in some newer vehicles, but those changes are too late to help the LX 570. It wouldn’t be as much of a con if the built-in system were good, but its structure is confusing, the navigation map is a mess and it’s uncomfortably difficult to use while driving.\n\nThere was also one weird quirk I found in the LX 570’s backseat: The floor is quite high, which elevates passengers’ knees and raises their thighs off the seat’s lower cushioning — unfortunate, because that’s some good Lexus-grade cushioning down there. You won’t notice on a short trip, but it will affect passengers on the longer jaunts I think Lexus envisions owners taking in this vehicle.\n\nSafety Technology Much Appreciated\n\nI came to appreciate many of the Lexus LX 570’s safety systems, which all worked flawlessly in my week with the SUV. I drove it in traffic and in cities, parallel parked it on city streets and somehow squeezed it into my apartment’s compact parking space. Though visibility is pretty good thanks to large windows all around and a commanding seating position, negotiating tight spaces would be nerve-wracking without the standard 360-degree camera system and parking sensors, which were very helpful without being overbearing.\n\nRounding out the list of standard safety features are all-speed adaptive cruise control, automatic wipers, forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, blind spot monitors and lane keep assist.\n\nUnashamedly Old-School\n\nThe 2018 LX 570 ended up being pretty much what I expected it to be: big and luxurious, with plenty of capability for adventuring (it can tow 7,000 pounds), but lacking in a few key areas around multimedia technology and drivability. I like the LX 570’s trucklike feel, but some customers will be looking for an SUV that, to be frank, doesn’t ride and drive like one.\n\nThat’s why when my time with the LX 570 ended, I found myself a little sad. I would hate for this to be the last one I drive, but I can see the world changing around it to the point where it may not make sense for Lexus to keep it in production. Having the LX 570 in the lineup in lieu of a large three-row crossover — that would likely cost much less and get better fuel economy — doesn’t really make sense. But for now, I’m glad it’s holding on.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Only 500 will be built.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Lexus LX 570 Are Most Important?\nFour-zone automatic air conditioning\n12.3-inch multimedia screen with navigation\nPower-operated second and third rows\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nHead-up display available\nWireless device charging available\nDual-screen rear entertainment system available\nShould I Buy the 2021 Lexus LX 570?\n\nThe LX 570 is comfortable, powerful and quiet, and it offers more off-road capability than most owners will utilize. However, its gas mileage isn’t great, and it’s a bit of a climb to get into. We’re also not fans of the Remote Touch multimedia interface.",

      "expert_review": "Their modern designs make it easy to overlook the fact that Lexus and parent company Toyota make some of the most old-school vehicles around, including the legendary Toyota Land Cruiser and its luxurious counterpart, the Lexus LX 570.\n\nWhile most modern SUVs trend toward urban performance with car-based platforms and low-slung profiles, the Lexus LX 570 is a dinosaur from a different era. It has body-on-frame construction, high sides and upright styling that has little regard for aerodynamics, and it drives off-road with aplomb. That’s why it’s hard to find direct competitors for the LX 570 outside of Toyota’s Land Cruiser. The Land Rover Range Rover is one exception; it’s priced close to the LX and can go virtually anywhere despite having unibody construction.\n\nOther models that compete on size and/or price include the Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80 and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. Compare the LX 570 with those vehicles here.\n\nAs good as it may be on a trail, however, I don’t think that’s how most Lexus LX 570 buyers will end up using their big ute, so I set out to see if the old dog had any tricks on the highways and byways of Los Angeles.\n\nNew for 2018: Two-Row Version\n\nFor 2018, the one major change for the LX 570 is the addition of a two-row, five-seat version aimed at those who don’t need a third row and want to gain some cargo room. In the traditional Lexus LX 570, the third-row seats are more of an obstruction when stowed than in many vehicles because they fold up to the sides rather than down into the floor. That LX has eight seats in three rows, but only 44.7 cubic feet of cargo volume behind its second row. The two-row jumps up to 50.5 cubic feet, a 13 percent increase.\n\nThere’s more good news: The two-row version comes with a $5,000 price decrease and starts at $86,575, but it’s mono-spec, meaning there are no trim packages available for it. While the three-row is comparably equipped to start, you can add a luxury package (including perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front- and second-row seats, and a four-zone climate control system) and a rear-seat entertainment system that brings a pair of 11.6-inch screens.\n\nCompare the 2018 LX 570 with the 2017 model here.\n\nPowertrain\n\nThe Lexus LX 570 comes with an old-fashioned 5.7-liter V-8 that makes 383 horsepower and 403 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive that offers an additional low gear via a switch in the center console. Next to that is a control for Lexus’ impressive crawl-control system, which can be set to maintain a slow pace over rough terrain without the driver having to manipulate the pedals. This system is standard, along with an air suspension that offers a variety of ride heights. I’d recommend letting the suspension automatically do its own thing on the road; raising it too high on your own can negatively impact ride quality.\n\nOn the street, the LX 570 drives like a more refined version of a large truck. The ride is butter smooth over pavement, and though there’s some extra body roll in the corners, the Lexus LX 570 doesn’t feel sloppy; its suspension gets it back upright slowly rather than explosively. The V-8 gets the LX 570’s 5,800 pounds moving easily and — most importantly — pulls hard between 40 and 70 mph, so passing is a breeze.\n\nRoad and tire noise are well-controlled — more so than in other vehicles that ride on truck-based platforms. Fuel economy is, predictably, not a strong point: 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nLet’s start with the positives: Materials and fit and finish are big highlights in the LX 570. It feels the part of a nearly $90,000 luxury SUV, and even though tan leather isn’t particularly my style (I’d always be afraid of spills or stains), it was very impressive. The front seats are also exceptionally comfortable, and the Lexus LX 570 comes with a feature called Climate Concierge, which employs multiple sensors around the vehicle to control the ventilation system, heated and ventilated seats and heated steering wheel (if equipped) to either cool or warm the car more comfortably for occupants.\n\nWhen it comes to misses, two big ones stem from Lexus’ insistence on using a weird knoblike mouse controller for its infotainment systems and continuing to resist smartphone connectivity options (Android Auto and Apple CarPlay). Lexus is starting to change this in some newer vehicles, but those changes are too late to help the LX 570. It wouldn’t be as much of a con if the built-in system were good, but its structure is confusing, the navigation map is a mess and it’s uncomfortably difficult to use while driving.\n\nThere was also one weird quirk I found in the LX 570’s backseat: The floor is quite high, which elevates passengers’ knees and raises their thighs off the seat’s lower cushioning — unfortunate, because that’s some good Lexus-grade cushioning down there. You won’t notice on a short trip, but it will affect passengers on the longer jaunts I think Lexus envisions owners taking in this vehicle.\n\nSafety Technology Much Appreciated\n\nI came to appreciate many of the Lexus LX 570’s safety systems, which all worked flawlessly in my week with the SUV. I drove it in traffic and in cities, parallel parked it on city streets and somehow squeezed it into my apartment’s compact parking space. Though visibility is pretty good thanks to large windows all around and a commanding seating position, negotiating tight spaces would be nerve-wracking without the standard 360-degree camera system and parking sensors, which were very helpful without being overbearing.\n\nRounding out the list of standard safety features are all-speed adaptive cruise control, automatic wipers, forward automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, blind spot monitors and lane keep assist.\n\nUnashamedly Old-School\n\nThe 2018 LX 570 ended up being pretty much what I expected it to be: big and luxurious, with plenty of capability for adventuring (it can tow 7,000 pounds), but lacking in a few key areas around multimedia technology and drivability. I like the LX 570’s trucklike feel, but some customers will be looking for an SUV that, to be frank, doesn’t ride and drive like one.\n\nThat’s why when my time with the LX 570 ended, I found myself a little sad. I would hate for this to be the last one I drive, but I can see the world changing around it to the point where it may not make sense for Lexus to keep it in production. Having the LX 570 in the lineup in lieu of a large three-row crossover — that would likely cost much less and get better fuel economy — doesn’t really make sense. But for now, I’m glad it’s holding on.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
