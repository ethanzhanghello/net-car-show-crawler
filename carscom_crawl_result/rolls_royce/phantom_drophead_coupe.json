      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Phantom Drophead Coupe is a convertible version of Rolls-Royce’s Phantom sedan. It competes in a small segment of ultra-luxurious, highly customizable convertibles that includes the Bentley Azure T convertible.\n\nNew for 2011\nRolls-Royce marks the centennial of its Spirit of Ecstasy “flying lady” hood ornament with the Spirit of Ecstasy Centenary Collection, 100 Phantom models that can be ordered with exclusive exterior colors and trim, wood veneers and interior trim, and commemorative plaques.\n\nExterior\nThe automaker says the Phantom sedan and convertible share no major exterior panels, though they look similar enough that Rolls-Royce aficionados will easily identify the tree this Drophead fell from. Rolls-Royce says the rear-hinged coach doors give easy access for rear passengers and add to the overall strength of the body by allowing an uninterrupted front roof pillar. Exterior features include:\n\n\nRear trunk gate flips down for what Rolls-Royce calls “picnic” seating for two\n21-inch wheels with run-flat tires\nVariety of optional 21-inch wheels\nAvailable brushed stainless steel hood, teakwood deck\n\nInterior\nThe four-seat interior comes drenched in wood, leather and chrome. Rolls-Royce says it avoided bleaches, stains and lacquers in favor of natural surfaces. The seats boast flat leather surfaces designed to be wiped free of moisture. The interior design isn’t limited to the automotive realm, as inspiration is said to be taken from 1930s yachts. Interior features include:\n\n\nHand-stitched leather interior\n15-speaker stereo\nAvailable mahogany, elm, oak and rosewood interior veneers\nAvailable iPod integration\nAvailable front and rear cameras\nAvailable embroidered head restraints with Rolls-Royce logo or customer’s design\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Drophead’s 6.8-liter V-12 makes 453 horsepower and 531 pounds-feet of torque. The engine, transmission and driveshaft are positioned as low as possible to give a lower center of gravity for a sportier ride.\n\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nSelf-leveling air suspension\nZero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds\n150 mph top speed (governed)\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nRollover protection system automatically deploys reinforced bars from behind the backseat head restraints\nSeat-mounted and side-impact airbags\nActive front head restraints",
