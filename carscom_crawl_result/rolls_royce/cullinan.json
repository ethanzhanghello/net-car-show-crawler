      "expert_review": "This is your fault, internet Land. The reason this thing exists is because of your crazy SUV love affair. When Rolls-Royce discovered you were parking your Ghost next to an SUV — probably a Mercedes-Benz G-Class or an Audi Q7 — the automaker decided it needed to be parked next to a Rolls-Royce SUV, so the automaker created this: the Rolls-Royce Cullinan.\n\nRelated: Rolls-Royce Cullinan (Not) SUV Revealed in All Its Absurdity\n\nThe Cullinan is the first SUV from the ultra-luxury brand, and it’s as extraordinary as you might guess, starting with its price tag. This thing costs more than the average family’s home with a starting price around $325,000; the one I tested clocked in at $420,000.\n\nRear-opening coach doors reveal a backseat that is the definition of comfort with a two-position backseat decked in Arctic White leather and Black Lambswool carpet. A third seat can be added to the backseat if the lounge configuration is selected upon order, but that deletes the center console arm rest, which includes such essentials as the whisky decanter and Champagne refrigerator.\n\nThe driving experience is also ultra-luxurious. For $400,000-plus, you’d expect a smooth ride, and the Cullinan delivers with excellent isolation from the road. Even its twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V-12 is smooth and quiet for overall serene road manners.\n\nBut wait, SUVs are supposed to offer extra utility over a sedan or a wagon, right? The Cullinan’s brand of utility is extra special. After getting to your brood’s equestrian championship, activate what Rolls-Royce calls a viewing suite, which is fancy for tailgating seats. The two-seat leather bench with matching cocktail table pops out at the push of a cargo-area button. Pass the caviar.\n\nWant to see more of the Cullinan’s outrageous features?
