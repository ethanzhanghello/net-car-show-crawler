      "expert_review": "Polestar continues to grow its lineup with the upcoming 3 luxury SUV and this, the 4, which Polestar calls a “performance SUV coupe.” We recently had the chance to get an up-close look at the all-electric 4, and while many of its design elements are similar to what you see on other Polestar models, its lack of a rear window is a departure from most everything else on the road.\n\nRelated: 2025 Polestar 4 Debuts With Up to 544 HP, No Rear Window\n\nSleek Looks Outside\n\nThe 4’s relatively low ride height gives it a hot hatch look, but these days most everything with an open cargo area is called an SUV — especially, it seems, when it comes to EVs. Just look at the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5 for two electric SUVs with carlike ride heights.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the 4 isn’t a handsome-looking EV. It has the same classy, sharp-but-understated look of other Polestar models, and the front end features an evolution of the brand face with bisected headlights and a large lower opening instead of the more traditional grille design that’s on the Polestar 2 passenger car.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe 4’s most unusual feature — the solid panel where the rear glass would normally be — is more subtle than you might think and is easily overlooked in passing. Rear visibility is instead provided by a rearview camera mirror — a feature increasingly available on models that still have rear windows — that uses a roof-mounted camera to show the driver what’s behind the vehicle.\n\nEven with a low, sloping roofline, the Polestar 4 has a decent amount of cargo space. The cargo area is relatively deep, and a dual-level cargo floor lets you add some height to the cargo space. A small front trunk under the hood gives you some additional luggage space, but just a bit more; the 4’s frunk is smaller than the ones in the Tesla Model Y and Mustang Mach-E.\n\nRelatively Roomy Interior\n\nFor a low-slung SUV, the 4 has decent front headroom, and the standard glass roof deserves some credit for that. The driving position is comfortable overall, and the seats of the model we saw were finished in an available woven fabric that has an upscale appearance. The driver faces a slim digital instrument panel that looks a little like a phone that’s been tipped on its side, and next to it in the center of the dash is a large 15.4-inch touchscreen. The infotainment system runs Google Built-In, but some of its features, like the on-screen controls for the air vents, are similar to what you’ll find in a Tesla.\n\nThe front bucket seats are separated by a center console that has familiar elements like cupholders, but there’s also an open storage area below for larger items. It’s a good use of the EV’s available interior space.\n\nThe backseat is quite accommodating for taller passengers, as the glass roof aids rear-seat headroom just like it does in front. Decent visibility out the side windows helps keep any feelings of claustrophobia at bay, but the seat cushion is close to the floor, resulting in a knees-up seating position that doesn’t offer much thigh support.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPolestar Flexible Lease Program Minimizes Commitment\nMore Powerful, Longer-Range 2024 Polestar 2 Priced, Starts at $51,300\n2024 Polestar 3 Up Close: 3 Is Greater Than 2 … Sort Of\n2024 Polestar 2 Adds More Power, Gets Up to 300 Miles of Range\nShop New Polestar Models\nSpecs, Pricing and On-Sale Time Frame\n\nWith 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.8 seconds for the 544-horsepower all-wheel-drive version, according to Polestar, the Polestar 4 offers a level of performance to back up its sporty looks. (However, Polestar says the rear-wheel-drive model is considerably slower to 62 mph, taking 7.4 seconds.) We’re looking forward to driving it to see whether the lack of a rear window is all that jarring, and you’ll be able to see what it’s like for yourself later in 2024 when the 4 goes on sale at a starting price of $56,300.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
