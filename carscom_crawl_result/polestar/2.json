      "expert_review": "The verdict: A highly entertaining sports sedan packed with Scandinavian design, but its range, room and price keep it from true greatness.\n\nVersus the competition: There’s only one big target here: the Tesla Model 3. Compared with that car, the Polestar 2 is pricier, less roomy and has a shorter range, but it’s much more conventional to drive and easily as entertaining — plus, its features are decidedly higher-quality.\n\nWhen you’re first to the game and wildly successful, a target gets painted on your back. Such is the case with the Tesla Model 3, the California automaker’s more affordable compact electric sports sedan that’s quickly become one of the best-selling luxury vehicles in the world regardless of power source. Everyone else has been playing catchup to Tesla, and we’re starting to see some of those efforts trickle in: the Audi E-Tron, Jaguar I-Pace, Porsche Taycan and now the Polestar 2.\n\nIt’s a brand you’ve likely never heard of, as it was recently spun off by Volvo and its Chinese parent company, Geely. Polestar used to be a high-performance tuner division whose name appeared on Volvo trim levels, and it still is to some extent, but that will eventually become less common as Polestar begins to flesh out its own lineup. As the Polestar 2 is the latest (but not last) effort to challenge the benchmark Model 3, we took it for an afternoon spin to see if it could hit that swift, silent, popular target. \n\nRelated: Polestar 2 Arrives to Challenge Tesla Model 3\n\nVolvo Family Genes\n\nYou don’t have to look too hard at the Polestar 2 to see its Swedish family heritage; despite being branded a Polestar, there’s obvious Volvo lineage in every facet of its styling. From the Thor’s hammer-style headlights and upright, chunky stance to the design of the taillights, nobody would’ve batted an eye had this thing debuted as the Volvo E60. Polestar representatives acknowledge this, saying both this car and the Polestar 1 two-door plug-in hybrid sports coupe definitely have visual ties back to Volvo, but that the next model, an SUV called the Polestar 3, will not. A hint at the unique design language that car and all future Polestars will use can be seen in the Precept concept car that Polestar put out in February, which was supposed to have debuted at the canceled 2020 Geneva International Motor Show.\n\nThe look is definitely a departure from most of the rest of the segment. It’s blockier than the Model 3 and less SUV-like than the Jaguar I-Pace or Audi E-Tron, despite the Polestar 2 having a four-door hatchback configuration. It sits a little higher than a traditional sports sedan but not as high as a new-style crossover; if you remember the old Subaru Outback sedan, that’s the vibe it gives off. It’s attractive in a spare, spartan Scandianavian aesthetic, which makes it stand out in its own way. Sadly, the visual interest does not extend to the paint color palette, which is a boring gradient between white and black; even my supposedly blue test car felt like just another variant of gray. Between the blocky styling and muted hues, the Polestar 2 feels practically invisible out on the road. Considering what the car can do, though, that might not be a bad thing.\n\nIs This the Future of Sports Sedans?\n\nVolvo builds some pretty spectacular sedans, so it’s no surprise the Polestar 2 inherited a lot of what made Volvo’s Polestar high-performance versions so fantastic. The new Polestar 2 is a legitimate electric sports sedan, especially when decked out with the optional Performance Pack my test vehicle had. \n\nBefore the options, though, it starts with the powertrain: a dual electric-motor setup powering the front and rear wheels independently, with rear bias. They produce 408 system horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque, good enough for a 0-60-mph time of less than 4.5 seconds, Polestar says. Being electric, the car’s torque curve is formidable, meaning acceleration comes on in a massive, seamless rush when you plant your foot. Initial acceleration is fairly calm, however; it’s not tuned to be jumpy, but rather efficient and laid back, delivering that quickness only when you’ve well and truly called for it. There’s no sport setting or mode changing at all, just some different settings for regenerative braking aggressiveness and steering settings.\n\nThe Polestar 2’s ride and handling is on the firm side of sporty, but it is adjustable — manually. The test vehicle I drove was equipped with the Performance Pack option, which includes 20-inch wheels, high-performance Brembo brakes and special Ohlins shock absorbers with 15 settings. My test car was set in the middle of the firmness scale, which I found to be too firm for everyday driving on Michigan’s broken roads. If you live somewhere that takes care of its roads, it would likely be fine, but I would have cranked those dampers all the way over to their softest setting in order to make it tolerable. I would have had to do so manually, however, as they’re not electronically adjustable — and I don’t know many people who’d take the time to change their damper settings. \n\nThat said, the balance and ride quality of the Polestar 2 was impressive. It handles beautifully, with the electric steering assist easily switchable among three settings requiring light to strong effort. I kept it in the middle, which provided sufficient sportiness and control without sacrificing ease of use. I did the same for the three regenerative braking settings — the strongest is too strong and the lightest doesn’t do anything, but the middle setting provided good balance. There was some accelerator liftoff regen activation, but it didn’t impede rolling momentum too much. The upgraded brakes made quick work of bleeding off any extra, unwanted momentum, with a solid pedal and no fade in repeated stops during aggressive backroads driving.\n\nDriving the Polestar 2 is similar to driving any number of EVs: It’s deceptively quick, able to blow past slower traffic with astonishing speed and next to no noise. Turns out, you don’t need sound to make fury, and I surprised more than one doddering RV driver with a sudden, silent blast past their window. It’s quick like the Tesla Model 3 and Jaguar I-Pace, but where the Polestar 2 delivers over other expensive EV experiences is in its chassis refinement. It truly feels like a premium European sports sedan, solid and unflappable, delivering a rewarding driving experience through the kind of feedback that’s often missing in computerized EVs. \n\nElectric Range: How Far Can It Go?\n\nThe battery itself is a 78-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion pack using LG Chem pouch-style cells. An EPA range rating was not yet available at publication time, but based on the European cycle — which tends to be considerably more optimistic than American testing methods — it’s good for 291 miles on a full charge. In the interest of having some real-world numbers, Polestar commissioned an independent range test between two new Polestar 2s (a regular version and one with the Performance Pack and 20-inch wheels), a Tesla Model 3, a Jaguar I-Pace and an Audi E-Tron. Performed by a testing lab on a closed 3-mile oval course, all cars were charged and set to run at 70 mph, with the climate control at 72 degrees, until they could no longer maintain 70 mph. As expected, the Tesla Model 3 went farthest, at 234 miles. The two Polestar 2s were next best, with the regular Polestar 2 going 205 miles and the Performance Pack model going 197 miles (Polestar estimates the EPA range will come in around 250 miles). The Jaguar I-Pace came in next, at 188 miles, followed by the Audi E-Tron, which brought up the rear at 187 miles. \n\nSwedish-Style Interior\n\nThe interior is perhaps the most obvious place where the Polestar 2 distinguishes itself from the Tesla Model 3. Like the E-Tron and I-Pace, it’s a much more conventional layout, in keeping with traditional automotive design: There’s a gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, dedicated buttons as well as touch-sensitive panel controls, and pleasing shapes that actually evoke some artistry. The Tesla is a tub with a central screen, but Polestar decided instead to maintain a more familiar setup — to good effect. It doesn’t feature the warm colors and wood tones you’ll find in a Volvo, but that’s intentional; Polestar’s aesthetic is cool and technological versus Volvo’s warm and organic. \n\nThat said, while the interior looks considerably more attractive than anything from Tesla, it doesn’t necessarily feel better. Some of the artistry doesn’t work so well, like the tiny air vents atop the dashboard that barely articulate and the fact that nearly everything employs a fingerprint-magnet black touchscreen. And for the price, the interior appointments feel rather cheap. There’s a good bit of hard plastic that feels thin and hollow when you knock on it. The environmentally friendly, vegan “WeaveTech” fabric on the seats (leather is optional) feels like chintzy wetsuit material, not something I’d expect on a car I’m paying more than $70,000 to drive. And sadly, the colors inside are just as drab as the colors outside unless you get the expensive leather option, which enables you to specify tan upholstery instead of gray or black. \n\nFront-seat comfort is good even if the seats do feel a little flat. The rear seats are less comfortable, with tight legroom and headroom despite the Polestar 2’s fairly upright roofline. The car looks bigger in photos than it actually is; you’re reminded it’s based on the Volvo XC40 subcompact SUV when you’re inside it. You don’t exactly sit low in the Polestar, but it still has the feeling of sitting in a tub thanks to squat windows and a high beltline. Outward visibility, however, isn’t bad — even through the rear window, thanks to a cutout in the rear roof that allows you to see farther down the road than you otherwise could. There’s a standard glass roof overhead, but it doesn’t have a shade, just some UV protection and tinting. Overall, it feels about as spacious for occupants as a Jaguar I-Pace, but less so than a Tesla Model 3 or the much larger Audi E-Tron. \n\nGoogle on Board\n\nThe Polestar 2 has the unique distinction of being the first production automobile to use the full Google Android Automotive operating system, meaning the entire central display — which controls not only the multimedia system but also vehicle systems like climate control, settings and others — uses software developed by Google. Why? Because it’s cheaper and easier for a low-volume vehicle, Polestar says. Developing a new interface, multimedia system and unique native apps to handle things like navigation and audio systems is expensive, especially when you don’t plan on making hundreds of thousands of cars to spread the cost around. The Polestar’s system allows you to share between personal Google accounts and the car, enabling downloads of media and apps from the Google Play store to the vehicle itself. Preferences can be shared between driver accounts and the car, or you can create an account specifically for the car — or you can not sign in at all and just use the systems the car comes with if you’d rather not share all your information with anyone who might use the car without you in it. \n\nThankfully, the Google system works quite well; the central display is huge and easy to use on the go, featuring quick navigation between screens, easy-to-find controls and a minimum number of menus to scroll through to find the appropriate controls. Certain features still have dedicated buttons, but they’re very few; Polestar instead dedicates space on the big tablet-style screen for functions like climate control. Color contrast is good, as are speed and responsiveness, and I had no complaints about the tablet-style controls aside from the typical gripes about lack of feedback from flatscreen “buttons” that simply don’t feel luxurious.\n\nThe central gauge cluster is also digital and reconfigurable. It’s not as easy to read as the big tablet display, but it can also display navigation and map information. What it oddly does not display is any audio system information, so unless you have the audio screen up on the central tablet display, there’s no way to know what radio station you’re listening to or what song is playing. It’s a curious omission from a digital screen given just about every other manufacturer features it in their partial or fully digital instrument panels.\n\nPrice May Be a Problem\n\nFull pricing for the American version of the Polestar 2 has not yet been announced, and seeing as how only the Launch Edition is for sale for the 2020 model year (lesser trim levels will come for 2021) and it’s already largely sold out, it may not matter much. That said, the base price for a 2020 Polestar 2 is $61,200 (all pricing includes destination fee). That includes two feature bundles that will be broken out into option packages for lesser trims in the future: the Pilot and Plus packages. Pilot includes adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, rear collision warning and mitigation, forward collision warning, lane keep assist, parking assist and more. Plus includes the panoramic glass roof, pixel LED headlights, heated wiper blades and steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, Harman Kardon premium audio and a few other interior goodies. \n\nYou can also add the Performance Package with its sporting equipment for $5,000, while a leather interior is another $4,000 option. If you load the Polestar 2 up with every conceivable option, you’re looking at more than $72,000. My test car did not have leather, but it still stickered at a lofty $67,550. You can drop that a little bit, though, because Polestar qualifies for a federal $7,500 tax credit, and some states and localities still offer tax rebates and incentives for purchasing an electric vehicle. \n\nPart of the Polestar’s high price is due to American import tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles — to the tune of 25% at the time of this writing. That’s one thing the California-built Tesla Model 3 doesn’t have to worry about, and its starting price is $36,200. Even a Model 3 Performance trim, which is a better match for the Polestar 2, starts at $56,190 — thousands of dollars less than the Polestar. Note, however, that Teslas are no longer eligible for a federal tax credit, as the company’s allotment has been exhausted. Base trim levels of the Audi E-Tron and Jaguar I-Pace match up better with the Polestar, with starting prices between $67,000 and $71,000, respectively. \n\nPolestar has created an interesting competitor for other luxury EVs on the market. It has a decidedly sporty bent to it, and it’s genuinely entertaining to drive. Its interior quality won’t thrill anyone coming out of an Audi, Jaguar or Mercedes-Benz, but it’s a notable step up from what Tesla offers. If not for the cringeworthy pricing, it would be more of a slam dunk choice versus the likes of the American Tesla; as it stands, however, it’s merely a solid, stylish alternative.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Polestar 2?\n\nDepending on your perspective, the Polestar 2 is either a low-slung SUV or a tallish sedan with a rear hatch. Either way, it’s a compact electric vehicle produced by Volvo’s fully electric subsidiary, Polestar. For 2024, the Polestar 2 was available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive in several trims with differing horsepower outputs and options; for 2025, the lineup is reduced to a single line-topping AWD trim with 476 horsepower. The Polestar 2’s competitors include BMW’s i4 Gran Coupe and i5, as well as the Genesis GV60 and Tesla Model 3.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Polestar 2?\n\nIn addition to its pared-down lineup and a couple of minor trim updates, the Polestar 2’s output has been boosted from 455 hp to 476.  \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Polestar 2 Have?\n\nThe Polestar 2 has an EPA-estimated driving range of 254 miles.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Polestar 2?\n\nEvery Polestar 2 has an 82-kilowatt-hour battery pack. On a typical Level 2 home charger, it can charge from 0% to 100% in about 8 hours. On a public DC fast charger, the 2 can replenish its battery pack from 10% to 80% in as little as 28 minutes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Polestar 2 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n20-inch wheels\nAdjustable suspension dampers\nBrembo brakes\nPanoramic moonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nSynthetic leather seating\nHeated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n11.2-inch touchscreen\nHarman Kardon sound system\nNavigation\nGoogle Built-In\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning with steering assist\nSurround-view camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNappa leather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 Polestar 2?\n\nThe Polestar 2 is an off-the-beaten path choice even among unconventional EVs. Its powertrain specs are certainly impressive, but more affordable vehicles — and ones with longer ranges — are not hard to find in its competitive set, nor are ones built by brands with wider dealer and service networks.",

      "expert_review": "The Polestar 2, an all-electric sports sedan from Geely-owned EV brand Polestar, aims to compete with the top-selling Tesla Model 3 by adding range and lowering the starting price. Polestar announced the arrival of a single-motor version of its Polestar 2 for the 2022 model year with a manufacturer-estimated 265-mile range and a starting price of $47,200 (all prices include destination).\n\nRelated: 2021 Polestar 2 Review: Is This the Future of Sports Sedans?\n\nFor 2021, the Polestar 2 was available exclusively with a dual electric-motor powertrain  with an EPA-estimated range of 233 miles and a starting price of $61,200. When we tested the vehicle for our review linked above, we enjoyed its strong acceleration, precise handling and distinct styling. But there were some drawbacks: The Polestar 2’s range paled in comparison to the Tesla Model 3’s maximum of 353-miles, and it carried a hefty price premium over Tesla’s entry-level car. The standard range Model 3, with a significantly lower starting price of $36,200, also offered a higher range of 263 miles.\n\n2022 Polestar 2 Single-Motor: Better Positioned to Compete\n\nThe longer-range, single-motor 2022 Polestar 2’s price is $14,000 less than the 2021 Polestar 2, and that’s before any local or federal EV tax credits. The increased range is slightly higher than the standard-range Model 3’s, and the price is also more competitive, especially since federal tax credits have expired for Tesla.\n\nPolestar 2 Dual-Motor Returns With Added Range\n\nPolestar has yet to reveal performance specs for the single-motor variant of the Polestar 2, but the automaker says the 408-horsepower dual-motor version will return for 2022. Its range also increases by 16 miles to an estimated 249. The dual-motor Polestar 2 will start at $51,200 before tax credits.\n\nPackages and Release Date\n\nBoth versions of the 2022 Polestar 2 can be upgraded with two packages. The Plus Pack ($4,000) adds a panoramic glass roof and premium interior as well as a mechanical heat pump that Polestar says increases the vehicle’s range by up to 10% “under certain climate conditions.” The Pilot Pack ($3,200) adds adaptive cruise control, Pilot Assist, a blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, a 360-degree camera system and more.\n\nThe dual-motor Polestar 2 is also available with a $5,000 Performance Pack, which adds adjustable suspension dampers, forged 20-inch alloy wheels, Brembo brakes and performance tires.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPolestar 2 Arrives to Challenge Tesla Model 3\n2021 Polestar 2: 7 We Like and 5 Things We Don’t\nPolestar 2 Packed With New Safety Tech That’s Very Volvo\n2021 Polestar 2 to Take on Tesla Model 3 With $61K Starting Price\nWanna Buy a Polestar?

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Sportier than the prior model year thanks to a change in driven wheels, the rear-wheel-drive 2024 Polestar 2 is more engaging to drive, but it still falls short in terms of user-friendliness and onboard technology.\n\nVersus the competition: The Polestar 2 RWD is not as quick as many competitors, and it’s not as engaging to drive as a Tesla Model 3 Performance, BMW i4 or even a Hyundai Ioniq 6. It’s comfortable and useful as a hatchback, but its interior feels less luxurious than those of its rivals.\n\nJust looking at the Polestar 2 pictured here, it’s hard to tell it apart from the one that debuted from the Chinese-controlled (Volvo-affiliated, ostensibly Swedish) electric luxury brand. It certainly looks the same; there aren’t even any new or interesting colors to be had on the 2024 version of Polestar’s entry-level four-door hatchback EV. But the pictures don’t show a massive change made for the new year: Polestar switched up the base 2’s standard single-motor setup, moving that motor from the front wheels to the back wheels.\n\nRelated: 2024 Polestar 2 Adds More Power, Gets Up to 300 Miles of Range\n\nThat’s the beauty of electric-car platforms: Most of them are essentially a kind of “skateboard” — with motors at each end and batteries in the middle — on top of which rides a “top hat” structure (the car body). So what Polestar has done is fairly simple, but the result is a big change in the dynamic of the 2’s lineup of single- and dual-motor models: It now includes a rear-wheel-drive vehicle and a rear-biased all-wheel-drive variant, ostensibly making it more attractive to an enthusiast crowd. We got one for a week to see if the switch makes any real difference in daily use. \n\nAll the Things You Cannot See\n\nForget the way the ‘24 Polestar 2 looks; all that’s changed is a new front-end panel between the headlights to accommodate some new sensors. Polestar didn’t give it any major style updates for the model year, and there are only a couple of color changes for the ‘25 model year (but they’re all still boring, muted “urban-inspired” hues). The Polestar 2 is still a four-door, five-seat hatchback with a fixed glass roof, and it’s still a stylish Scandinavian take on an electric compact car. \n\nWe certainly don’t hate that it’s a hatchback, as the utility gained from this body style is undeniable; most duties don’t require an SUV when you have this level of cargo space utility. The 2’s design doesn’t stand out in any way, allowing it to fly under the radar most of the time — especially in the dark Midnight Metallic color my test vehicle was painted. If you’re looking to go unnoticed by civilians and constabulary alike, a muted-hue Polestar 2 is, frankly, a good way to go about it. \n\nThe big changes for the 2024 Polestar 2 are all under the skin, and they come in two areas. First is the aforementioned switch from FWD to RWD for the base single-motor model. Power, battery capacity and range are all up, too. My test vehicle was a single-motor RWD Plus trim level with 299 horsepower and 361 pounds-feet of torque — both healthy bumps over the ‘23 model’s 231 hp and 243 pounds-feet. Polestar says the increase in power has made a significant improvement in acceleration, knocking 1.1 seconds off the car’s 0-60 mph time, which now sits at a Polestar-reported 5.9 seconds. The single-motor ‘24 Polestar 2 uses a larger 82-kilowatt-hour battery (79 kWh usable) that contributes to improved range over the ‘23 model; this version’s range tops out at 320 miles, according to the EPA. The company says this version will go from a 10%-80% charge on a DC fast charger in about 28 minutes at up to 205 kilowatts (if the stars, temperatures and conditions align, of course). So, how do the changes made to the 2024 Polestar 2 add up? Does it feel any different?\n\nOut on the Street\n\nFor most people driving a Polestar 2 every day — commuting on highways, byways, two-lanes and boulevards — the answer is no. You won’t notice the switch from FWD to RWD. The change really only shows up when you drive aggressively, as you might on a twisty back road or when canyon-carving down your favorite mountain pass. The old Polestar 2 would understeer at its limits even with AWD, but this new one is much more tail-happy, allowing you to adjust the car’s trajectory in corners using the accelerator pedal. But the Polestar 2 isn’t really built for that kind of driving; there’s no Sport mode, just adjustable steering effort. You’ll notice the rear-drive feel when executing turns from a stop, such as when pulling out onto a road and accelerating hard, but the traction and stability control systems intervene quickly, before the rear tires can break loose. Overall, the feel of the rear-drive car is more sporty and engaging, but, again, only when driven aggressively. You might notice the RWD layout in slippery conditions or snow, but if you live somewhere with inclement weather, all-season or winter tires will make much more of a difference than front- versus rear-wheel drive. \n\nThe rest of the Polestar 2 behaves much as before. The ride and handling balance is excellently tuned, with a compliant, bump-absorbing suspension that avoids the wallowy nature that’s often associated with heavy electric sedans. Handling is reasonably sharp, but if you’re really looking for a sporting experience, an available Performance Pack that can be added to the dual-motor AWD version is really the way to go. The 2’s adjustable-effort steering can go from video-game numb to decently involving, but it’s not particularly communicative or sporting. The brakes are strong and provide decent feedback, and a more aggressive one-pedal driving mode is available for increased regenerative braking if you’d rather have a full-on EV experience. \n\nIn a nutshell, the added power and switch to a rear-drive setup has helped make the Polestar 2 more appealing to enthusiasts, but it hasn’t transformed the base model into a true sporty EV. Throwing down with a BMW i4 would show that in stark detail, as the BMW is much sharper in its responses. A Hyundai Ioniq 6 sedan is also just as entertaining to drive as the Polestar, while a Tesla Model 3 Performance is a considerably sharper tool. \n\nCabin and Tech Woes\n\nThe bit that hasn’t changed for the better is the 2’s cabin and technology. It’s reasonably comfortable up front in the Polestar 2 — though the backseat is a little cramped for headroom and legroom — and the shapes and designs inside are just as Scandi as the outside. It’s a clean, simple look that’s nicer than most of what Tesla offers, but it falls short in a number of areas. The designs might be attractive, but the colors and materials are dour and depressing; there’s no color in any of the Polestar lineup, it seems, inside or out. Everything is grayscale, with a few dark blues thrown in and an occasional gold highlight on things like the brake calipers and seat belts in vehicles with performance options. The rest of the interior is just dark, rubbery, neoprene-feeling materials. The rubberized recycled materials on the dash and seats give the interior the distinct smell of a wetsuit, which isn’t terribly inviting. The Ioniq 6 has an equally modern interior with equally appealing shapes, but surprisingly superior materials. The BMW i4’s interior quality and materials choices are vastly superior.\n\nThings haven’t improved with the Polestar 2’s Android Automotive operating system, either, which powers the multimedia and gauge displays. It uses Google Built-In, so if you’re well entrenched in the Googleverse with all of your personal data and communications applications via mobile phone and other outlets, all you’ll need to do is add the Polestar 2 to your pantheon of Google devices. For Apple users, it’s more of a burden to integrate, though CarPlay connectivity is included. But regardless of how much you want to bring the Polestar 2 into your life’s data infrastructure, its multimedia system just isn’t great. It’s a bit confusingly organized, almost all controls are in the touchscreen (including the climate controls, which we detest), and it doesn’t offer much in the way of customization or reconfigurability. \n\nFor being a digital screen, the gauge cluster itself is remarkably spartan — no audio information is available in the cluster, and it can only switch back and forth between the gauges or a full-width navigation screen. You can’t customize it at all, which smacks of cheapness; isn’t one big point of a digital display the ability to make it suit your needs? Again, Hyundai and BMW are worlds ahead in this department, offering far more interesting displays with myriad options and tons of selectable information.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Polestar 2 Gets Longer Range, More Options\n2025 Polestar 3 Adds Rear-Drive, Single-Motor Base Variant\n2025 Polestar 4 Up Close: New ‘SUV Coupe’ Looks (Only) Ahead\n4, 5, 6: 2025 Polestar 4 Electric SUV Pricing Released, Starts at $56,300\nShop for a 2024 Polestar 2\nNot Getting What You Pay For?\n\nOne of my original complaints about the Polestar 2 was that it simply didn’t feel as sophisticated, luxurious or technologically advanced as its price seems to necessitate. Despite getting a boost to its performance chops and driving engagement, that remains the 2024 Polestar 2’s dominant fault. With a starting price of $51,300 (all prices include destination fee), the Polestar 2 should be far and away more luxurious, opulent and advanced than a $38,650 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE Standard Range, but it’s not. In fact, a fully loaded AWD Ioniq 6 Limited, which will run you $55,800, is a far better deal than that basic Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor RWD for $51K. The BMW i4 Gran Coupe has similar specs to the Polestar but again features a much more appealing interior for similar money. Of course, the EV to beat in this segment is still the Tesla Model 3, which is much cheaper in RWD form, starting at $40,380. It’s  fairly even money with a Polestar 2 in the Model 3’s Performance AWD trim, but the Tesla blows the 2 away in terms of performance. We’re talking a 2.9-second 0-60 time for around $56,000; that money gets you a 0-60 mph time of roughly four seconds in an AWD Polestar 2 — and that’s before you consider the $7,500 federal tax credit that the Tesla qualifies for. The Polestar 2 is only eligible for that credit on leases.\n\nThat really is the Polestar 2’s ultimate problem: It’s not a style standout, it’s not a performance standout, and it doesn’t do EV things in a particularly unique way or better than anyone else. It doesn’t offer the kinds of features and customization you can get elsewhere for less money, and it’s not a particularly good value. That makes it hard to recommend the Polestar 2 in the still-nascent luxury electric car class. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Polestar 2 all-electric sedan enters the 2023 model year with some enhancements to its performance and range, additional equipment and increased prices. If you already bought a Polestar 2, however, you shouldn’t feel left out; many of these updates are or will be available as over-the-air updates.\n\nRelated: 2022 Polestar 2 Price Shrinks by $14,000, Range Grows\n\nDual-Motor Gets More Range\n\nRange for the dual-motor variant is expected to hit 260 miles — up 11 miles from the 2022’s 249 miles, itself a 16-mile increase from the 2021. Polestar says this is because of software updates that improve the mechanical heat pump’s effectiveness. The manufacturer says the pump, which is part of the optional Plus Pack, will now improve range in temperatures from 20 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. Polestar also says a free over-the-air update is coming that will give existing models with the heat pump the same operating range, but it didn’t provide a specific timetable.\n\nThe Plus Pack also adds a new cabin air filter along with an air-quality sensor and app that Polestar says will display information about the air quality in the cabin and outside the car, including pollen types.\n\nMore Performance From Performance Pack\n\nIn previous model years, the optional, dual-motor-exclusive Performance Pack added suspension, brake, and wheel and tire upgrades. For 2023, it will also include a power upgrade, adding 68 horsepower and 15 pounds-feet of torque.
