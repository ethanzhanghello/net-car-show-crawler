      "expert_review": "What’s the difference between a sports car and a grand touring car? It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one when discussing expensive or exotic machinery like the 2018 Maserati GranTurismo convertible seen here. This grand touring car, a “GT,” is meant to be fast, but it’s not meant to be a track star. You could take a GT onto a track for some fun, but you’re much more likely to take one down a coastal road to dinner on the shore with a couple of friends along. GTs tend to have more seats, a softer ride and handling, and more creature comforts than sports cars. The Maserati GranTurismo I spent some time with recently fits this role perfectly.\n\nThe public thinks Maseratis are pretty special. The Italian luxury brand (owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) slots in above FCA’s Alfa Romeo brand in terms of prestige, but much of the road-going public still thinks of Maserati as something akin to Lamborghini, Ferrari or McLaren in terms of exoticness. It’s not exactly true — Maseratis are indeed nice cars, but their bespoke specialness isn’t quite at the level of those rarified beasts. At least not nowadays, and FCA is OK with this, ramping up Maserati to far more volume than it has ever sold in the past.\n\nThe GranTurismo convertible is not really part of that volume plan, however. This is something of a holdover from the older days of Maserati — this specific car actually predates the formation of FCA. It was created from a platform introduced nearly 15 years ago, and it hasn’t seen a major update since its introduction in 2008. According to FCA’s grand five-year business plan, it’s due to be replaced by 2022 with a fully updated coupe and convertible based on the gorgeous 2014 Alfieri concept. That means the GranTurismo is going to soldier on for another few years as seen here, which warrants a closer look.\n\nThe Body of a Supermodel\n\nDespite being an older design, the GranTurismo still turns plenty of heads. Two things immediately strike observers about this car: its dramatically pointy snoot and its copious overall length. The hood is remarkably low because this is actually a mid-engine car — while the engine is in front of the cockpit, it’s located entirely behind the front axle line. This affects the car’s weight distribution and handling, but also allows designers to give it a long, low look and to provide a pair of seats behind the front occupants that are actually able to carry real-sized humans.\n\nThe styling is very traditional, however, and is starting to look dated, but comparing it to its contemporary competitors is difficult as there really aren’t any direct competitors anymore. Traditional 2+2 coupes and the convertibles on which they’re based all have been replaced with the new “four-door coupe” idea, as we now have the BMW 6 Series going all four-door for 2019, the Mercedes-Benz CLS as a four-door and other large coupes like the Jaguar XK simply being dropped in favor of smaller models like the F-Type. I’ll posit that the GranTurismo currently stacks up best against things like the Mercedes-Benz SL, itself a grand touring car despite its two-seat-only layout, and the Lexus LC 500. One might be tempted to put it up against things like the Bentley Continental GT or Aston Martin DB11, but the Maserati is far less expensive and exclusive than either of those super-lux coupes.\n\nThe Heart of a Prancing Horse\n\nPop the hood and marvel at the naturally aspirated V-8 engine, nestled way far back in the engine bay. That’s a Ferrari-derived-and-assembled 4.7-liter V-8 making 454 horsepower, which it delivers to the rear wheels through a standard six-speed automatic transmission. If this seems like a slightly outdated powertrain in these days of 10-speed transmissions and small, twin-turbocharged V-6 and V-8 motors, that’s because it is. Maserati itself offers a 550-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 in the much newer Ghibli sedan and Levante SUV. But just because the GranTurismo’s engine is older doesn’t mean it isn’t still a sweetheart of an engine. The song this Ferrari V-8 sings is one of the most melodious tunes you’re likely to hear emanate from some tailpipes, but you get to hear it only under certain conditions.\n\nThere are three drive modes and two transmission modes to choose from, which doesn’t sound like much adaptability compared with most modern GTs. And here’s the issue: If you want to extract the maximum glorious sound from this V-8, you have to put the drive mode in Sport, the transmission mode in Manual and shift the gears yourself. Otherwise, the engine is far too muted to truly be enjoyed, masking the GranTurismo’s more exotic roots to passersby. When in Normal mode, it may as well be a family sedan. Keep things dialed into maximum Sport mode, use the enormous paddle shifters behind the steering wheel and you’ll find a bigger smile on your face than you otherwise would. You drive a car like this to be noticed — not to slink around town in stealth mode.\n\nAcceleration from the big V-8 is brisk, but not brutal. With only six speeds, the transmission is geared more toward cruising than drag racing, but it will still throw you back in the seat with plenty of force when you mash the go-pedal. The handling is best described as balanced. The rearward position of the engine helps with weight distribution, which yields positive results. The GranTurismo feels heavy and stable, but it can still hustle between corners with an entertaining zest. Changing to Sport mode stiffens up the steering and shock absorbers but not so much as to be uncomfortable over broken pavement.\n\nMy drive all over southeast Michigan for a week saw a variety of road conditions, and not once did the GranTurismo fail to deliver on the promise of being a classy, comfortable, stylish cruiser. My only quibble with the car’s performance is with the brakes — the first few inches of pedal travel are basically dead air, with nothing happening until you really put your foot down hard. Once they bite, the Maserati’s brakes are plenty tight, but that unusual behavior does make it challenging to drive smoothly in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nFuel economy isn’t much of a consideration in a vehicle like this, but for those who are curious, the GranTurismo convertible is EPA-rated at 13/20/15 mpg city/highway/combined, and my weeklong stint in one with a rather heavy foot returned an acceptable 17 mpg overall. Competitors like the Mercedes-Benz SL550 tend to do better, rated at 17/25/20 mpg, thanks to three additional gears in its transmission.\n\nThe Interior of a 1990s Fiat\n\nOK, that subhead might be a bit harsh. While the GranTurismo’s interior is decidedly dated, it’s still covered in sumptuous, quilted leather and screwed together with a palpable precision. Seat yourself in the spacious, comfortable bucket sport seats, and you’re treated to black leather with red stitching, carbon fiber trim, big, easily legible gauges and a quality feel to all of it.\n\nSadly, you’re also facing a central gauge cluster that features a monochromatic LCD screen straight out of the 1990s, green backlit climate control buttons from the same era and controls that feel similarly dated. Ironically, that old climate control panel sits below the latest and greatest FCA Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen running Maserati-brand multimedia software, which features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s an odd mish-mash of old and new in the GranTurismo, with some pieces updated from the FCA parts bin and others holding over from the days before FCA was a thing. Somehow, it all still works, proving that you don’t throw something out just because it’s not state-of-the-art. But when you compare it with competitors, let’s just say that the new Alfieri can’t get here soon enough.\n\nThe model I drove was the convertible, featuring a fabric top that retreats under a hard tonneau cover. The top works quickly and smoothly, but watching it descend will give owners some potential heartburn as you realize the top is a convoluted contraption of cables and straps that looks certain to wear out sooner rather than later in the car’s life. The length of the GranTurismo necessitates a long roof, however, so some element of cantilevered design had to work its way into the folding lid. If it gives you pause as well, consider the extended warranty for this part. Top up, the GranTurismo is reasonably quiet, with most of the exterior noise coming in through the rear quarter windows. Top down, you get to hear the wonderful engine more easily, and wind buffeting is impressively absent, even without the bulky air deflector installed aft of the front seats.\n\nThat air deflector folds up and stores in what little trunk space there is, effectively rendering the trunk useless. Without the deflector, it can hold one, maybe two soft-sided duffel bags, but nothing more. Rigid panels cordon off space for the folding top mechanism to the detriment of a usable trunk. The coupe has much more room back there, but if you absolutely need more than a duffel or two, you’ll be placing it in the backseat instead.\n\nPriced to Keep It Rare\n\nDespite the boom in sales that Maserati has enjoyed, the GranTurismo is still priced to put it in rarified air and guarantee that you’re not going to see one on every street corner. The base price is $150,650 for a Sport convertible, with my test vehicle adding a couple of custom color and trim options to top out at $157,090 (all prices include destination charges). If you want something slightly more sporty, you can opt for the MC trim, which is a tick quicker to 60 mph, has slightly different interior appointments, and adds about $13,000 to the sticker price before options.\n\nCompetitors are increasingly rare, as big, rear-wheel-drive luxury coupes are about as popular as smallpox these days. Many have fallen by the wayside, but there are still a few grand touring coupes that fit the bill. The Lexus LC 500 might be the closest competitor, with far wilder styling that probably won’t prove quite as timeless as the Maserati’s in a decade’s time, but with a much more modern interior and superior technology. The Mercedes-Benz SL550 is due for a refresh of its own and is actually cheaper than the GranTurismo but still features a more up-to-date powertrain. The Jaguar F-Type is smaller and less expensive but can be optioned up to match prices with the Maserati and unlike the Lexus is also available in convertible form.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: All the best bits of Maserati’s current product lineup coalesce into the all-new 2024 GranTurismo, a spectacularly elegant two-door package that doesn’t just feel next-gen, but next-next-gen.\n\nVersus the competition: There are no direct competitors to the new GranTurismo. Comparing it with sports cars like the Porsche 911 and Aston Martin Vantage isn’t exactly apt: This big, heavy and tremendously powerful Maser has the legs and heart to keep up with — and out-coddle — the best of ’em.\n\nThere is great satisfaction to be found in driving a car or truck in its intended environment. Scrambling a Jeep Wrangler through a treacherous, rocky ravine channels the same energy as nailing a redline shift in a Porsche GT3 or towing a gooseneck with a dually — or even hauling your extended family in a minivan. So when I found myself facing down a 1,000-mile, 15-hour round-trip road blast from Los Angeles to Tucson, Ariz., I said ciao to a 2024 Maserati GranTurismo and set off touring — grandly.\n\nIt’s likely been a while since you’ve thought about Maserati’s enduring grand tourer. The first-generation two-door left production after the 2019 model year, marking the end of a Methuselah-like 12-year production run. Until Maserati itself revealed the second-generation GT in late 2022, it seemed even the Trident itself forgot it had built much of its 77-year road-car history on big, front-engined grand tourers.\n\nRelated: 2024 Maserati GranTurismo: Amore, Now With Fewer Cylinders\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nA Class of Its Own\n\nMuch like the long-lived first-gen GT, there isn’t anything else like the new GranTurismo for the money. Plenty of coupes match its 2+2 seating configuration, but few offer the same blend of comfort and performance, and none deliver the Maserati’s passionate, emotive experience. All 2+2 Ferraris, Aston Martins and Bentleys are too expensive, and all Porsche 911s — while impressively comfortable — lack the Maserati’s usable backseat and languid road-trip demeanor.\n\nEven with a fairly substantial $25,000 starting-price hike over the previous generation, the Maser remains in a league of its own. But, when climbing around the new car, it’s immediately clear that the car is so comprehensively improved over its predecessor, it’s remarkable Maserati didn’t change the first digit of its $158,000 starting price (including destination) to a “two.”\n\nNot to say the new GranTurismo is worth $258,000, but anyone who spent $134,000 on one of the later first-gen Maserati GTs five years ago might feel a bit cheated when they peek inside the 2024 version. Viewed from a distance, however, there’s little that’s “next-gen” about the exterior of the new car. It looks remarkably similar to its progenitor, and that is a wonderful thing; the original GranTurismo continues to be a strikingly beautiful car from just about any angle.\n\nSame Stunner\n\nWith the new 2024 GranTurismo, Maserati wisely massaged that original, gorgeous clay, integrating more than a little of the brand’s MC20 and modern proportionality onto the original profile. The result is a slinky, silky shape that embodies the style of the grand tourer: long hood, recessed cabin and low “rise” points. I usually leave such subjective analysis on the cutting room carpet, but I can’t help myself — visibly, this car is close to perfect.\n\nThat said, no one else seemed to notice. Around the moneyed metropolis of Los Angeles and my later stopover in Scottsdale, Ariz., the new GT presented (nearly) like every other two-door Maserati clogging valet lots. I suspect its nondescript white paint did little to help the situation, but I felt as though I were driving around a clever little secret that only a handful of folks caught onto.\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHellion Heart\n\nIt might not have stood out at the valet stand, but the new GranTurismo was the star of every desert interstate I traveled; I like to think it appeared as more of a flash of white light than a car during my many aggressive overtakes  — an easy feat with the GT’s hellion six-cylinder heart.\n\nThe previous GranTurismo’s cross-plane, 4.7-liter iteration of the Ferrari-Maserati F136 V-8 was singular in sound, with a rich, intoxicating roar. It was delicious, but age relegated the once cutting-edge engine to relative obsolescence. The 2024 GranTurismo’s new twin-turbo 3.0-liter “Nettuno” V-6 is a detuned version of the MC20’s engine, but it retains its twin-spark, pre-chamber ignition setup, which boasts high compression, increased efficiency and shocking power-density. Two flavors of the GT are available at launch — standard Modena and top Trofeo trims — and they growl through traffic and howl down highways with markedly different levels of power.\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMy Trofeo test car’s 542 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque are a boost of 59 hp and 36 pounds-feet over the base Modena version. The old V-8 GranTurismo was a joy to ring out for its soundtrack, but the new GT’s crashing waves of torque are addictive. Nothing shrinks space like speed, and the GranTurismo dices up miles, gaps and passing lanes like a supercar. Maserati says the Trofeo is good for a 3.3-second 0-60 mph dig, which feels both right on the money and somewhat prosaic in this age of 1,000-hp triple-motor electric sedans.\n\nNo matter — with the Nettuno engine, it’s less about the numbers than the sensation. The GT feels turbocharged in the best way, defying its relatively diminutive displacement and 3,957-pound mass. Sport and Corsa drive modes allow you to dial up accelerator response and shift-logic aggression in the traditional eight-speed automatic transmission, allowing the Trofeo to gather speed and compress your chest like something with more cylinders and twice the displacement.\n\nQuintessential Grand Tourer\n\nThese holeshot heroics, however, only show up when you need them. Left in the default “GT” drive mode or Comfort mode, the new GranTurismo loafs about with all the nervousness of a living room couch. Both all-wheel drive and an adaptive air suspension are standard, and it’s the latter that supplies the requisite dual nature of a grand tourer: sharp when you want it, soft when you don’t.\n\nTruth be told, other than a few curved on-ramps and scenic park pathways, a tight time constraint meant I had to keep the GranTurismo’s nose pointed straight and true, hundreds of miles away from my favorite driving roads. The best insight I can offer on this car’s handling is that, at its stiffest (in Corsa mode), roll is kept to a minimum, and the chassis feels astoundingly athletic when taken in context with the past generation. I can also attest to the suspension’s notable bump isolation and compliance over broken pavement — GT mode was even too soft at times; more than once, damping resonance over speed bumps caused me to bottom out. When encountering speed bumps on the road, I had to slow down so much I’d get honked at, and I was careful to pre-raise the selectable suspension height for any parking lot humps.\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAll drives appear to start in GT mode, which balances accelerator, transmission and suspension tuning. Comfort predictably mutes everything, to maximum effect, while Sport stiffens the suspension, drops ride height and prods the drivetrain in the back. Corsa pegs the meter with the stiffest and lowest ride — and disconcertingly reduces traction control. Forcing traction off in the most aggressive drive mode is a trait this Maserati shares with its cousin Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio cars, and I’m not the biggest fan. Outside of track use, there are few times I enjoy turning off traction control — especially when blasting down a remote mountain pass.\n\nAlso shared with both Alfa and Ferrari is the GranTurismo’s suspension button, which operates as a step-down function for the dampers. In other words, if you want the snappy throttle, reactive transmission and wedged-open exhaust of the Sport and Corsa drive modes, but without the punishing ride, the suspension button will drop stiffness one level. It’s a bit unconventional, but I made great use of this function in Sport mode, enjoying the ability to be obnoxious with the Nettuno’s bark while keeping my butt free of any bite. All other inputs are similarly well executed; steering is wonderfully balanced, with quick turn-in and satisfying weight, and the brakes are expectedly strong (though brake-pedal feel is incongruously soft).\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo Interior | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nCockpit Quantum Leap\n\nThe right mix of comfort and driving fun was never a shortcoming of the old GranTurismo. Its weakest link was by far its interior, which was frustratingly disorganized when new, outdated by the middle of its life cycle and shocking at its sunset. Of all the new generation’s improvements, it’s the ground-up redesign and total modernization of the interior that make it stick the landing.\n\nThe 2024 GranTurismo’s interior is essentially an adapted and upfitted version of the Maserati Grecale’s cockpit, complete with a shared steering wheel, driver display and bilevel center dash screens. That’s not a bad thing; the GT’s suite of high-grade materials elevate it a step above its affordable-ish compact SUV source material. The leather is rich and fragrant, extending from seat to door to dash, with swathes of microsuede, brushed aluminum and raw carbon fiber filling the gaps.\n\nAs long as you can deal with spiritually sharing space with the plebs in their Grecales, it’s a lovely environment in which to wick away the interstate hours. I was even OK with the dual-screen setup — even the touch controls. A 12.3-inch high-resolution screen on the top portion of the dash handles the infotainment and main display functions, while an 8.8-inch display directly underneath it houses touch-based controls for the air conditioning, seat heating and ventilation, interface configurations and drivetrain functions, including the engine stop-start system.\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nBoth center screens are notably fast and reactive, and they’re reasonably intuitive to navigate. I’ll never stop pining for real buttons, but this setup is attractive and quick enough that, for me, it’s not a deal breaker. The 12.2-inch digital gauge display is equally handsome and well configured, with a mix of high-res animations and distinct layouts when toggling between drive modes that proved fun to explore.\n\nSpeaking of tech, Maserati’s latest collection of active driving-assist systems is impressive. Things you might expect to be an afterthought were given both resources and focus; the available active lane keep and steering assist systems demonstrate less ping-ponging and binarity than most. You’ll have to pay for the privilege, though, with the Full ADAS Package clocking in at $8,300.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Maserati Grecale Review: Baby SUV Serves Up Big Grins for Big Price\nIs the 2023 Maserati Levante a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\n2023 Maserati Grecale Breezes in With Up to 523 Horsepower, EV Model Is Next\nResearch the 2024 Maserati GranTurismo\nShop for a 2024 Maserati GranTurismo\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nLovely, Loud Luxury\n\nThere’s been a lot of chatter around the GranTurismo’s price hike and lofty MSRP ceiling, but, to me, it’s right on target. Adjusted for inflation at the time of this writing, the $132,975 starting price of the 2018 GranTurismo inflates to $165,458 in 2024 bucks — a conceptual increase of only around $7,000. Granted, my heavily optioned test vehicle carried a nasty $229,620 sticker, but I’d have been happy to leave its $8,300 ADAS package, $4,000 optional wheels and $4,000 Sonus Faber sound system on the shelf.\n\nIf it wasn’t already obvious, I’m smitten. The all-new 2024 Maserati GranTurismo is such a quantum leap in performance, ergonomics and technology that it feels like a third gen, not a second. If you’ve got a healthy enough bank account and a lengthy road-trip wish list, slide into a GranTurismo for an extended test drive — just make sure your route includes plenty of long, straight, empty stretches of desert highway.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It was delivered via fancy automobile carrier, one of those super-protective carriages for cars of such expense or importance they are best transported within the body and atop the wheels of another vehicle.\n\nWhat irony, I thought.\n\nA car with a base price exceeding $135,000, yet it is too dainty, too special to endure the road rigors of something substantially less expensive.\n\nI mentally dubbed it a “trailer queen” – a car kept dust-covered and garaged until an event such as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, where the rich and super-rich come out, usually in August, to show off exotic automobiles they seldom drive, or drive gingerly.\n\nIt was an error of judgment, a bias inherent in my background as a Louisiana house boy who cleaned the bedrooms and toilets of the wealthy. The 2010 Maserati Gran Turismo Convertible discharged from that transport trailer in the middle of Arlington’s Williamsburg Boulevard in the morning’s wee hours, so as to avoid the terrors of rush-time traffic, turned out to be a beast of a machine.\n\nIt was a sexy beast, too.\n\nIt’s trademarked “Bianco Fuji Pearlescent” paint, “bianco” being the Italian male variant of the Spanish “blanco,” meaning “fair, white,” shone handsomely in the late-summer sun. Its priapic nose and muscular front fenders – no other way to describe that assemblage – drew wide-mouthed attention everywhere I parked. And that’s “agape” as in lustful, amazed wonder as opposed to the “agape” of nonsexual, spiritual Christian love.\n\nCrowds formed around the Gran Turismo Convertible in Northern Virginia parking lots. Women called out to me, especially when the car’s automatic convertible top was lowered. Some made unprintable verbal offers. My God! If they were cougars, what am I? I am 63, with rapidly thinning and graying hair.\n\nSuddenly I understood why so many Hollywood celebrities are in love with things Maserati. If among your addictions, your greatest need is for unending, envious, worshipful attention, the Maserati Gran Turismo Convertible is the car for you.\n\nBut it’s not the one for me. I much prefer private indiscretion over public exposure, the latter of which is patently inescapable in a car with a deliberately provocative body and an exhaust note reminiscent of the call of the wild – or, in this case, the call of all law enforcement personnel within hearing distance.\n\nI felt sheepish every time I pushed the throttle, emitting a deep, bass “varrrooommm,” appearing ready to peel rubber when all I really wanted to do was move gently from “stop.”\n\nThe 2010 Maserati Gran Turismo Convertible, with rear-wheel drive, comes with a 4.7-liter, 32-valve, electronically controlled, variable-valve-lift, gasoline-fueled engine (433 horsepower, 361 foot-pounds of torque).\n\nIt demands premium fuel. It also demands the freedom of a racetrack, which can’t be found on public thoroughfares in Northern Virginia, or public roads anywhere else, for that matter.\n\nI was happy to see it go, reminded of my early Catholic-school teaching that all approbation and seeming public approval should be treated as the moral equivalents of a Palm Sunday greeting. Some weeks, regardless of your good intentions or best efforts, have a way of ending with a Good Friday.\n\nI had outlived my chances of driving without a traffic ticket, or some other unhappy encounter, in the Gran Turismo Convertible. I smiled as it was retrieved, lifted into the cushioned elegance of that fancy automobile carrier to be delivered to another Walter Mitty of the automotive media. It had outworn its welcome in my psyche. A Hollywood celebrity I am not, and could never, ever be.",

      "expert_review": "Over the past week, our readers have shown impeccable taste when it comes to vehicle styling, bringing the 2018 Lexus LC 500h into second place among our most read car reviews. In fact, more people read the review (many times over) during the last week than the number of LC 500h examples Cars.com reviewer Joe Bruzek found for sale on our site; he was only able to track down nine listed across the country when writing his review.\n\nRelated: More Expert Car Reviews\n\nBruzek has high praise for the LC 500h’s looks, but the powertrain and driving experience are more of a mixed bag:\n\n“The LC is an amazing-looking car that drives amazingly with the V-8, but it loses a lot of its soul not having the responsive, cackling gas engine,” he notes.\n\nBruzek also expressed disappointment about the use of hybrid technology solely for fuel efficiency while some competitors’ electrified models get an electrifying performance boost. Check out his review to see if the fuel economy advantage makes the LC 500h worth it to you.\n\nVideo watchers last week focused on two redesigned cars, 2019 versions of the Nissan Altima and BMW X5. Our First Drive video for the X5 occupies the top spot, with the Altima’s First Drive close behind. Rounding out the top five are Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley’s take on why the 2018 Audi A4 is a winner, useful car hacks and our review of the 2019 Jeep Cherokee.\n\nTop 5 Reviews\n\n1. 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Plush and Poised, With a Push-Button Problem\n\n2. 2018 Lexus LC 500h Review: High Class and High Mileage\n\n3. 2018 Maserati GranTurismo Convertible Review: A Fine Wine Borders on Overripe\n\n4. 2019 Mazda CX-3 Review: Good Things, But in a Small Package\n\n5. 2019 Hyundai Veloster Review: Funky Fun\n\nTop 5 Videos\n\n1. 2019 BMW X5: First Drive\n\n2. 2019 Nissan Altima: First Drive\n\n3.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe GranTurismo is a four-seat grand touring coupe with V-8 power. A high-performance S version is available, as is a convertible version. The GranTurismo competes with the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Jaguar XKR and Mercedes-Benz CL550.\n\n(Skip to details on the: GranTurismo S; GranTurismo Convertible)\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nMaserati teamed with Italian design company Pininfarina to style the GranTurismo. The car features a wide oval grille, a long nose and a short rear. It sits low to the ground and has a very sleek profile overall. Exterior features include:\n\n\n19-inch wheels; 20-inch wheels available\nThree air inlets behind front fender\nRear LED taillights\nGrille features vertical concave slats\nChrome exhaust tailpipes\nAdaptive bi-xenon headlights\nOptional colored brake calipers\n\nInterior\nMaserati cloaks the interior in high-quality leather and wood and puts chrome accents on the dashboard. There’s seating for four people; Maserati says two adults fit comfortably in the backseat. Interior features include:\n\n\nNavigation system with 7-inch screen features a hard drive for storing music\nRear parking sensors standard; front sensors optional\nNumerous interior material options, including Alcantara simulated-suede headliner and wood trim\n\nUnder the Hood\nMaserati says the GranTurismo coupe can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 5 seconds and reach a top speed of 177 mph. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n405-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 with 339 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission with four operating modes and paddle shifters\nSkyhook adaptive suspension automatically adjusts shock-absorber firmness for different driving and road conditions\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nFront and side-impact airbags\n\nGranTurismo S\nIf the regular GranTurismo isn’t exotic or fast enough for you, the GranTurismo S serves as a high-performance version featuring more power, bigger brakes and exterior modifications to increase performance. Other details include:\n\n\n433-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 with 361 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission differs from base GranTurismo’s in a way meant to provide better daily drivability\nSide and rear-lip spoilers add balance through aerodynamics\n20-inch wheels feature seven-spoke design\nBlacked-out grille\nInterior upholstered in leather and Alcantara Back to top\n\nGranTurismo Convertible\nKnown in most other markets as the Maserati GranCabrio, the GranTurismo convertible uses the 433-hp V-8 from the GranTurismo S, but because of the additional weight of a convertible structure, its zero-to-60-mph acceleration drops slightly to 5.3 seconds. Its top speed is 176 mph. Other details include:\n\n\nPower-folding soft-top works in 24 seconds\nTrunk volume uncompromised whether the top is up or down\nPop-up rollover bars Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe GranTurismo is a four-seat grand touring car available as a coupe or a convertible with V-8 power. The GranTurismo competes with the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Jaguar XKR and Mercedes-Benz CL550.\n\n(Skip to details on the: GranTurismo Convertible)\n\nNew for 2012\nThe 4.2-liter V-8 that was the base engine has been discontinued, leaving a 4.7-liter V-8 as the lone engine in a revamped lineup. The S coupe and base convertible come with a 433-horsepower 4.7-liter, and the new MC coupe and Sport convertible have a 444-hp version of the V-8. Maserati’s Skyhook electronically adaptive suspension is standard on the Sport convertible and optional on the MC coupe.\n\nExterior\nMaserati teamed with Italian design studio Pininfarina to style the GranTurismo. The car features a wide oval grille, a long nose and a short rear deck. It sits low to the ground and has a sleek, road-hugging profile. Exterior features include:\n\n19-inch wheels; 20-inch wheels available\nThree air inlets behind front fender\nUnique aerodynamic bodywork on GranTurismo MC\nGrille features vertical concave slats\nAvailable carbon fiber exterior trim on GranTurismo MC\nAdaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional colored brake calipers\n\nInterior\nMaserati cloaks the interior in high-quality leather and wood and puts chrome accents on the dashboard. The GranTurismo seats four, and Maserati says two adults fit comfortably in the backseat. Interior features include:\n\nNavigation system with 7-inch screen features a hard drive for storing music\nRear parking sensors standard; front sensors optional\nNumerous interior material options, including Alcantara simulated-suede headliner and wood trim\n\nUnder the Hood\nMaserati says the GranTurismo coupe can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 5 seconds and reach a top speed of 177 mph. Mechanical features include:\n\n433-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 on S coupe and base convertible\n444-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 on MC coupe and Sport convertible\nSix-speed automatic transmission with four operating modes and paddle shifters\nAvailable Skyhook adaptive suspension automatically adjusts shock-absorber firmness for different driving and road conditions\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nFront- and side-impact airbags\n\nGranTurismo Convertible\nKnown in most other markets as the Maserati GranCabrio, the GranTurismo convertible comes as a base model with the 433-hp V-8 or the new Sport model with the 444-hp engine. Because the convertibles weigh more, Maserati says the zero-to-60-mph acceleration drops slightly to 5.3 seconds. The top speed is 176 mph. Other details include:\n\nPower-folding soft-top raises or lowers in 24 seconds\nPerformance exhaust system for Sport model\nOptional carbon fiber exterior and interior trim available on Sport\nSkyhook adaptive suspension standard on Sport\nPop-up rollover bars\n\nBack to top",
