      "expert_review": "For Italian car fans who have missed seeing Maserati’s Tridenet badge in the new car marketplace, the news that Maserati is returning to the North American market is news indeed.\n\nThe official announcement was made at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.\n\nMaserati has been affiliated with Ferarri since 1997, when Ferarri bought the company from Fiat. Hoping to revive its fortunes, which flagged under Fiat ownership, Maserati displayed two brand new models, a Spyder convertible and a Coupe. Both models are rear drive, and powered by a 4.2-liter, 390-horsepower V-8. Producing 390 horsepower, this Italian stallion is capable of a top speed of 175 mph.\n\nUnlike a Ferarri, the Maseratis are meant to be more of a daily driver, according to Sean Seltzer of Maserati North America.\n\nMaserati plans to start selling the car in mid-March, with a pricetag somewhere north of $80,000. Seltzer says the company sees its competition as the Jaguar XK8 and XKR, the Mercede-Benz SL- series and the Porsche Carrera.\n\nBut, Seltzer says the buying experience is different from that of its competitors. “We don’t advertise, we don’t undercut, and we sell at full sticker.”\n\nSo one won’t see “buyer of the week” ads from Maserati dealers. Instead, the buyer will be able to customize.\n\nRather than containing a plastic dash, Maserati has leather- trimmed dashboards. A customer can customize the carpet, overhead liner, seat piping and stitching, even the brake calipers. Says Seltzer, “It’s for those who want the only one like it.”\n\nMaserati is following the example set by Ferarri, which had a buyer who wanted her Ferarri seats trimmed with violet piping. Ferarri honored the request. “Somewhere there’s a Ferarri with violet piping,” muses Seltzer.\n\nMaserati expects to sell 1,200 Spiders and coupes in the first year, with a Pininfarina-designed four-door sedan coming for 2004.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMaserati had been out of the U.S. market for a decade when the renowned Italian builder of exotic sports cars returned for the 2002 model year with a brand-new Spyder convertible.\n\nMaserati was one of the prime Italian sports-car makers of the 1950s, 1960s and beyond. The revived Spyder project began after Ferrari took control of Maserati in 1997. The two-seater’s styling is credited to Italdesign-Giugiaro, one of the top Italian design firms, and Ferrari handles the car’s marketing in the United States.\n\nAt the 2004 Paris Motor Show, Maserati unveiled a 90th Anniversary edition of the Spyder that features carbon-fiber aerodynamic parts. Only 90 will be available in the United States, and 90 more will be produced for the rest of the world. A mild updating for 2005 includes a larger grille and two-tone interior colors.\n\nExterior\nModern touches blend with traditional sports-car styling in the Spyder, which rides on 15-spoke wheels measuring 18 inches in diameter. A contemporary version of the historic oval Maserati shield appears on the hood and is positioned above a familiar trident on the grille. Arch-type roll bars are installed, and the power top operates electrohydraulically.\n\nThe Spyder rides a 96.1-inch wheelbase and measures 169.4 inches long overall. Weight distribution is 53/47 percent front to rear.\n\nA Skyhook automatic suspension control system was developed with Mannesmann-Sachs. Sensors constantly monitor the movement of the wheels and body, and a computer adapts damping according to driving and road-surface conditions.\n\nInterior\nTen shades of leather upholstery for the handcrafted interior are available. Each seat is powered and has an integral head restraint, and a memory feature for the driver is standard.\n\nAn information center holds a 5.8-inch color display. Electronic rear-parking sensors are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Spyder’s 4.2-liter V-8 develops 390 horsepower at 7,000 rpm. An electronically actuated six-speed-manual Cambiocorsa gearbox with four modes � Normal, Sport, Automatic and Low Grip � is offered. It can operate in fully automatic mode, or the driver can manipulate paddles behind the steering wheel to change gears. A conventional six-speed manual is also available.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include side-impact airbags, electronic brake-force distribution and traction control. All-disc antilock brakes were developed with the Brembo company.\n\nDriving Impressions\nExcept for the harsh-shifting Cambiocorsa transmission, the stylish Spyder delivers a satisfying road experience. Once you learn how to tame it a bit, the Spyder performs with real gusto.\n\nA heavy throttle foot in automatic mode can make downshifts horrid. When you first step on the gas, the Spyder seems reluctant to move; when it does, the car likes to lurch ahead.\n\nNoise and vibration are abundant at idle, but the Spyder rides rather comfortably. The seats are pleasantly supportive, but some of the gauges are difficult to read. Impaired over-the-shoulder visibility with the top up can make merging into traffic worrisome.",
