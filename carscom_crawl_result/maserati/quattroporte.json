      "expert_review": "Verdict: The 2016 Maserati Quattroporte is a fast, stylish, rare executive luxury car that banks on styling and brand cachet to overcome its lack of the latest technology.\n\nVersus the Competition: Other full-size luxury flagship sedans, particularly the German ones, offer far more technology for the same money – but none can match the Maserati’s exclusivity, knockout styling or novelty.\n\nMaserati has never been a big player in the global luxury-car scene; it’s never sold anywhere near the volume that giants like Mercedes-Benz and BMW do. But that makes spotting one a rare event, and that rarity has built up something of a mystique around the brand’s cars. Tell someone you’ve just arrived in your BMW 7 Series and they’ll likely smile and compliment you on your choice. Tell them you’ve just parked your Maserati Quattroporte outside and you’ll find yourself following them outside to show it off.\n\nThe Maserati Quattroporte (Italian for “four-door”) last received an update in 2013, when it moved to a new platform shared with the shorter, less-expensive Ghibli sedan. Compare the 2015 and 2016 Quattroportes here. It shares some powertrains with the Ghibli, as well, but notably shares some interior parts with Chrysler products, as Maserati is the premium luxury brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThe Maserati Quattroporte is priced to compete with cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series and Porsche Panamera. I spent a week with a 2016 Quattroporte S Q4 with all-wheel drive and a V-6 to determine whether or not the public’s awe of the Maserati name is at all deserved.\n\nExterior & Styling\nEveryone who laid eyes on the Quattroporte declared it a beautiful car, without exception: strangers at gas stations, family members, passers-by on the highway. The number of thumbs-up, waves and compliments was truly surprising. But all those compliments seemed to come after observers noticed the trident logos on the C-pillars and grille or the Maserati script on the tail. It lent credence to my observation that the Quattroporte is indeed pretty but no longer remarkable. People love it simply because it’s a Maserati.\n\nWhen the Quattroporte was introduced, its shape was novel and unusual. Since then, other brands have made vehicles that look a lot like the Maserati Quattroporte. It’s got a low front end with small bi-xenon headlights and a large oval grille, sweeping back to fenders with Buick-style porthole vents, three on each side. My father actually thought it was a Buick when I pulled up in it.\n\nThe back end has strong, wide fenders and a high deck, but the shapes are no longer unique or unusual; it bears too much resemblance to a Kia K900 in a number of ways. Paint color plays a big part. In my test car’s metallic gray, it’s completely anonymous. Slather it in deep blue, though, like one I happened to pass on the street, and it’s strikingly elegant.\nHow It Drives\nPowering the Maserati Quattroporte is a choice of two engines. My test car featured a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission that routed power to all four alloy wheels (the Q4 part of the Quattroporte S Q4 name). It’s the same powertrain I sampled in the Ghibli two years ago (see the review) and, just like in the smaller car, the engine and eight-speed automatic are perhaps the Quattroporte’s best feature.\n\nWhile the engine block is cast at a Chrysler facility in Kokomo, Ind., that part is then shipped over to Italy where it’s assembled into a final engine by Ferrari. The V-6 makes 404 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, and it also makes a sound unlike any V-6 you’ve ever heard. Pop the mode selector button into Sport and vacuum-actuated butterfly valves open in the exhaust to allow a rasping bark to escape under moderate throttle. It pops and sings, echoes off walls and other cars, and turns heads as much as it makes you smile. It also propels the big Quattroporte forward at formidable speeds, helping the car feel more athletic than its girth and heft would suggest.\n\nThat said, while the Maserati is no featherweight, it is considerably lighter than its competition. It bests the Mercedes-Benz S550 by 540 pounds and comes in 377 pounds lighter than a BMW 750. The Porsche Panamera is lighter by 110 pounds, but it’s also a smaller car.\n\nThe Maserati Quattroporte handles well for such a large car (it’s longer and wider than either the S-Class or the 7 Series), but that’s not to say it’s agile. Ride quality is excellent, with the suspension soaking up road imperfections in true grand touring style. Nicely weighted steering helps the car track true on highways. It’s also quiet and serene inside, with little in the way of road or wind noise to interfere with the Italian opera being piped through the exhaust.\n\nThe shock absorbers can be firmed up with the push of a button, but that really only serves to make the ride more uncomfortable; it doesn’t seem to add any newfound ability to the Quattroporte’s excellent suspension tuning. Braking performance is strong – almost too strong: smoothly managing the last few feet of travel when coming to a stop takes some practice, as the big brakes become grabby at lower speeds.\n\nFuel economy is surprisingly decent for a car this big, even though I tended to run its small, turbocharged V-6 at higher rpm just to hear it sing. My week with the Quattroporte, which included nearly 400 miles of highway driving, netted an average of 22 mpg. The Quattroporte S Q4 is rated a rather poor 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined, making my observed numbers more significant.\n\nThe Maserati’s rating isn’t much different from the competition: The Mercedes-Benz S550 with its twin-turbo V-8 is rated 16/26/19 mpg, almost exactly the same as the BMW 750i xDrive’s 16/25/19 mpg. The lighter, smaller Porsche Panamera 4S is rated 17/27/21 mpg.\nInterior\nThough troubling for reviewers like me who sample a lot of cars over the course of a year, the Quattroporte’s biggest problem is not likely to be a concern for most of its buyers. The issue is inside the car and comes in the form of all the Fiat Chrysler parts-bin components I can easily identify. The multimedia system is pure Chrysler Uconnect, down to the fonts used. The window switches are from a Jeep Grand Cherokee, the multifunction turn signal-wiper stalk is from a Chrysler 300 and the steering wheel is the standard corporate part from any number of Fiat-Chrysler vehicles. For $126,000 and change, I expect uniqueness – or at least more distinctiveness than you’ll find in a car costing around $26,000. But I’d wager that most Maserati buyers have never been inside a Dodge Dart and the only time they’ve seen the inside of a Chrysler 300 is from the backseat of the Uber they took to the airport. For them, this will likely feel like pure Maserati style, not obvious cost-sharing.\n\nThat’s because the parts themselves aren’t bad; except for the shifter, everything in the car has a solid, well-crafted feel to it. The electronic shifter itself is garbage. It’s the confusing type, difficult to operate quickly, that has since been recalled on Chrysler 300s, Dodge Chargers and Jeep Grand Cherokees. It springs back to center when pushed forward or back and requires astute attention to confirm what gear you’re in. Designs of this type are still in use on many Audis and Maseratis, however, and from its cheap plastic feel to its damnably infuriating operation, it’s a deal-killer for me in a purchase situation. The shifter also features a tap-shift function for manual operation of the transmission, but it’s so easy to accidentally tap when operating the climate controls or radio that you’ll often find yourself accidentally downshifting.\n\nMy car came equipped with the optional Ermenegildo Zegna special edition interior. It features dark gray Mulberry silk fabric from the world-famous Italian suit-maker as the seat inserts, door panels and headliner material. It looks fantastic against the saddle leather and piano-black trim, making for an impressive dose of style that the 7 Series can’t quite match (though the S-Class can).\n\nThe Maserati’s leather seats are big and comfortable but don’t offer quite the same adjustability (or massage or adaptive cushioning) as the Benz. Backseat comfort, however, is also impressive and easily a match for the Benz or Bimmer, with plenty of legroom for occupants in the stretched chassis. Headroom is also plentiful despite the car’s swoopy roofline and a four-seat option is available if you want to extend the front center console all the way into the backseat. If driving the Quattroporte isn’t your thing, riding in its backseat isn’t a bad alternative.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nCost-sharing is the name of the game for the Maserati brand, which is understandable given the low volume it sells. Why not share some parts with high-volume Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep? As mentioned, the touch-screen multimedia system is Chrysler Uconnect, which means it works well, is simple and easy to use, and responds quickly. The one in my test car, however, seemed to be an older version, as it had problems syncing up with my iPhone 6S. I’d also expect at least a little effort to re-skin the screens used so the system doesn’t look like it came straight out of a car costing 20 percent of the Maserati Quattroporte’s sticker price.\n\nThe ergonomics of the rest of the car are a mixed bag. You sit low in the Quattroporte but not low enough to see the tops of the two round gauges in front of you. Adjusting the steering wheel to a mostly comfortable position for me cut off the speedometer between 30 and 120 mph. Thankfully, you can choose to display a digital speedometer between the two gauges; without it, you’d never know your speed. The climate controls are buttons instead of touch-sensitive panels, but they have backlit, white icons that completely disappear in bright sunlight.\n\nThe Quattroporte shows far less attention to the vehicle’s controls and connectivity systems than its rivals do. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Quattroporte’s size enables it to carry plenty of people and stuff. The trunk is a sizeable 18.7 cubic feet, besting the 18.2 cubic feet of the BMW 750i, the 15.7 cubic feet you get in a Porsche Panamera, and the surprisingly small 12.3 cubic feet of the Mercedes-Benz S550. Storage inside the car isn’t as copious, however. A center armrest console is the only place you have to put anything, and there’s only one cupholder per person in the front seat.\nSafety\nThe Quattroporte has not been crash-tested, but if it eventually is, the results will appear here.\n\nUnlike offerings from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche (and Cadillac, Kia, Hyundai and others), the Maserati Quattroporte doesn’t offer much in the way of electronic safety aids. Blind spot warning, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors are standard, as is a backup camera, but that’s about all you get.  Adaptive cruise control, collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning or prevention – none of it is available on the Maserati Quattroporte.\n\nThe S-Class, meanwhile, is a technological marvel that practically drives itself, as is the 7 Series. If having all the latest tech and gadgetry is your goal, the Quattroporte won’t be your choice. See the Quattroporte’s standard features here.\nValue in Its Class\nNo, you don’t buy a Quattroporte for its tech, or for its value. The 2016 model starts at $101,700 including destination for a basic, rear-drive S model. Stepping up to the Q4 with all-wheel drive will run you $109,700, while opting for the V-8-powered Maserati Quattroporte Sport GT S will set you back $143,300 – and that’s a hefty $16,800 per additional engine cylinder (though it also gets you Maserati’s Skyhook adaptive suspension and a lot of other standard equipment).\n\nMy Maserati Quattroporte S Q4 rang in at $129,770 including the Zegna interior package, stitched trident logos on the headrests, piano black-trim, metallic paint, a powered rear sunshade and the Comfort and Assistance Package.\n\nThe competition is formidable and includes some of the most advanced luxury vehicles in the world. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is the benchmark for the segment and, while you can’t get one with a V-6 in the U.S., you get a powerful twin-turbo V-8 for the price of the Maserati’s V-6. In fact, for the price of the Maserati, you can get an S550 loaded with technology, comfort and luxury items that shame the Quattroporte – but you don’t get the Maserati’s exclusivity and you trade off German technological prowess for Italian style.\n\nThe same can be said for the BMW 7 Series, which offers many of the same innovations as the S-Class but is available with a six-cylinder engine. Both the Benz and the BMW can be had with executive rear seating packages, as well, which coddle backseat occupants as if they were in a luxury jet. Like the Mercedes-Benz, the BMW is loaded with technology and luxury features when optioned up to the same price as the Maserati.\n\nWith more compact dimensions inside and out, the Porsche Panamera is more of a sports car than a grand touring sedan like the Quattroporte. It has a wider variety of powertrains, too, and a far larger price span, ranging from a starting price of $79,150 up to nearly $300,000 for a loaded, all-wheel-drive Exclusive Series. The Panamera gets by on its abilities, however, not on its looks; it’s generally considered to be nowhere near as shapely as the Maserati. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nThe Maserati Quattroporte is meant to go up against the big dogs from the major luxury marques, but it can’t compete when it comes to technological innovation or safety features. Instead, it makes its mark with style and cachet – whether real or imagined. Time and again, whenever someone asked me about the Quattroporte and I brought up its shortcomings, they invariably responded with “Yeah, but it’s a Maserati!”\n\nYou can’t buy that kind of cachet, but it is very real – and Maserati is counting on it to overcome the Quattroporte’s competitive deficits.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor the 2005 model year, Maserati introduced a full-size four-door luxury sedan called the Quattroporte. Designed by Pininfarina, the rear-wheel-drive Quattroporte competes against the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nThe Quattroporte has Brembo all-disc brakes and a Skyhook automatic-damping suspension. A 394-horsepower V-8 engine works with Maserati’s DuoSelect sequential manual transmission, which can be shifted using paddles mounted on the steering column. Maserati says the Quattroporte can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a swift 5.2 seconds. For optimum weight distribution, the engine sits aft of the front axle and drives a rear-mounted transmission.\n\nAt the Frankfurt auto show in September 2005, Maserati displayed two new versions of the Quattroporte: an Executive GT and a Sport GT. The Executive GT has polished 19-inch wheels and heated, ventilated and massaging rear seats. Stowable rear tables and a wood and leather steering wheel also are installed.\n\nThe Sport GT features 20-inch wheels, carbon fiber trim, racing pedals, and a black grille and side air vents. Maserati’s Skyhook suspension system has been modified for use in the Sport GT, and a sport exhaust system is installed.\n\nExterior\nMaserati refers to the sleek Quattroporte as “contemporary Italian art.” Recognizable Maserati styling cues include its long hood, prominent grille and headlights, and the classic Trident emblem on the windowless C-pillars. Low-slung front fenders, short front overhangs, a swept-back profile, a high belt line and a steeply raked windshield also help establish what the company calls an “authoritative persona [and] predatory appearance.”\n\nA broad horizontal-bar grille also contains Maserati’s Trident badge. The headlights sit slightly back, and a wide air intake is installed below the grille. Three portholes adorn each front fender. Standard wheels measure 18 inches in diameter. Built on a relatively long 120.6-inch wheelbase, the Quattroporte is 198.9 inches long overall and 56.6 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nFive people can luxuriate inside the Quattroporte, where premium wood is complemented by handcrafted leather. Rosewood is standard, but buyers can specify mahogany, burl walnut, a titanium-style trim or piano black finish.\n\nStandard features include a 14-way power driver’s seat with a memory feature, power rear seats, a power rear sunshade and a cooled compartment in the front armrest. Touching a button in the center rear armrest moves the front passenger seat forward, supplying additional legroom. The Bosch-Blaupunkt Multi Media System includes a navigation system, Bose stereo and TV tuner.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Quattroporte’s 4.2-liter V-8 engine generates 394 hp and 333 pounds-feet of torque. The six-speed sequential manual transmission can be shifted using paddles mounted on the steering column. A Low Grip mode is included for driving in poor weather conditions.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, the Maserati Stability Program, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain-type airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor the 2005 model year, Maserati introduced a full-size four-door luxury sedan called the Quattroporte. Designed by Pininfarina, the rear-wheel-drive Quattroporte competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Changes for 2008 include the addition of a new Sport GT S trim level that sits above the rest with added equipment for sport-minded buyers. High-performance brakes, 20-inch dark chrome wheels, a stiffer suspension and lowered stance are some of the differences you’ll find on the Sport GT S.\n\nThe Quattroporte has Brembo all-disc brakes and a Skyhook automatic-damping suspension. A V-8 engine works with Maserati’s DuoSelect sequential transmission, which can be shifted using paddles mounted on the steering column. Maserati says the Quattroporte can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a swift 5.2 seconds. For optimum weight distribution, the engine sits behind the front axle and drives a rear-mounted transmission.\n\nIn addition to the Sport GT S, the are also Executive GT and Sport GT trim levels. The Executive GT has polished 19-inch wheels and heated, ventilated and massaging rear seats. The steering wheel is made of wood and leather.\n\nThe Sport GT features 20-inch wheels, carbon fiber trim, racing pedals, and a black grille and side air vents. Maserati’s Skyhook suspension system has been modified for use in the Sport GT, and the car has a sport exhaust system.\n\nSport GT S models have high-performance composite cross-drilled brake rotors to optimize braking and reduce brake fade. The 20-inch wheels are finished in dark chrome and feature larger tires than other Quattroporte models.\n\nExterior\nRecognizable Maserati styling cues include its long hood, prominent grille and headlights. Low-slung front fenders, short front overhangs, a swept-back profile, a high belt line and a steeply raked windshield also help establish what the company calls an “authoritative persona [and] predatory appearance.”\n\nA broad horizontal-bar grille contains Maserati’s Trident badge. The headlights sit slightly back, and a wide air intake is installed below the grille. Three portholes adorn each front fender. Standard wheels measure 18 inches in diameter. Built on a relatively long 120.6-inch wheelbase, the Quattroporte is 198.9 inches long overall and 56.6 inches tall.\n\nSport GT S models have a blacked-out mesh grille and black-painted trim pieces that give the GT S a distinctive, stealthier look compared to other trims.\n\nInterior\nFive people can luxuriate inside the Quattroporte, where handcrafted leather complements the premium wood trim. Rosewood is standard, but buyers can specify mahogany, burl walnut, a titanium-style trim or piano black finish.\n\nStandard features include power front and rear seats, a power rear sunshade and a cooled compartment in the front armrest. Touching a button in the center rear armrest moves the front passenger seat forward, supplying additional legroom. The Bosch-Blaupunkt Multi Media System includes a navigation system, Bose stereo and TV tuner.\n\nAlcantara faux suede is used on GT S models’ interiors to highlight the seats, door panels and steering wheel. And what’s a sport edition without carbon fiber? The GT S has a carbon fiber instrument panel with aluminum highlights.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Quattroporte’s 4.2-liter V-8 engine generates close to 400 horsepower and 333 pounds-feet of torque. The six-speed sequential transmission can be shifted using paddles mounted on the steering column, but it also includes a fully automatic mode. A Low Grip mode is included for driving in poor weather.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "I was introduced to Maserati at a particularly bad time in the company’s often troubled history. It was 1989, the year Maserati joined Chrysler to launch the Chrysler TC by Maserati.\n\nIt was a match made in hell. Chrysler was an up again, down again American car company trying to rise up again, at least in prestige, by mating with a legendary Italian luxury brand. Maserati was a car company so down on its financial luck, it was willing to jump into a joint venture with anybody, including Chrysler.\n\nThe Chrysler TC by Maserati was the unhappy progeny of that unfortunate union. It was supposed to be a “halo” car, a sales magnet to pull buyers into Chrysler’s showrooms. But it was little more than a workaday Chrysler K-car wearing costume jewelry. It did nothing for Chrysler’s prestige and even less for Maserati’s bottom line. It went out of production in 1991.\n\nSince then, for me, Maserati evoked thoughts of fallen grace. I paid little attention to the marque until last week when a group of Maserati executives rolled into the District with the 2007 Maserati Quattroporte Executive GT automatic sedan.\n\nI had seen the car this year in the Luxury Row section of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It looked pretty, but I gave it scant notice, thinking that it was the motorized version of one of those once-splendid European castles that now take in day-tripping tourists for their upkeep but offer little in terms of useful or comfortable modern accommodations.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThat the car is beautiful is understatement. It is exquisite, a stunning work of art. Leather tanned and treated by Poltrona Frau, which produces some of the world’s most supple hides, covers the Quattroporte Executive GT’s seats front and rear. The wood inserts on the center console, dashboard and interior door panels are of the highest quality — in this case, mahogany with rosewood inlays.\n\nThe exterior by Italy’s Pininfarina represents automotive body sculpture at its best — clean, fluid lines moving from the unique trident-emblazoned grille up front to the car’s nicely tapered rear end.\n\nIt all has been put together perfectly, which is something that cannot be said of previous Maseratis, which often sacrificed fit-and-finish craftsmanship in favor of on-the-road performance. The new Maserati, judging from the overall quality of the tested Quattroporte Executive GT, sacrifices neither.\n\nInstead, it probably is best to think of the Quattroporte Executive GT as a Ferrari with four doors and, when desired, with family-friendly manners.\n\nThe Maserati Quattroporte (four-door) Executive GT dismisses those notions. Mechanically, it is a collaborative work with Ferrari, using much of that company’s technology. Its 400-horsepower, all-aluminum, 32-valve V-8 engine employs four overhead camshafts and electronically controlled variable valve lift and timing to generate maximum power without commensurate consumption of fuel. The automatic transmission, which also can be shifted manually, can handle 339 pound-feet of torque — power from the engine to turn the rear drive wheels — 75 percent of which is available as low as 2,500 revolutions per minute, and the rest of which is deliverable at 4,250 rpm.\n\nTo put it simply, the car can move. And Maserati offers its DuoSelect transmission, an electronically controlled, Ferrari-derived, six-speed manual transmission as an option to help it move even faster.\n\nBut where the Maserati Quattroporte Executive GT differs from other exotic performance cars is that it can be used as an everyday driver. It also recognizes something that too many other exotic, high-performance cars ignore, which is that rich people have children, too. It has seats for a family of five.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Maserati Quattroporte was written in June 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nMaserati has never been a big player in the global luxury-car scene; it’s never sold anywhere near the volume that giants like Mercedes-Benz and BMW do. But that makes spotting one a rare event, and that rarity has built up something of a mystique around the brand’s cars. Tell someone you’ve just arrived in your BMW 7 Series and they’ll likely smile and compliment you on your choice. Tell them you’ve just parked your Maserati Quattroporte outside and you’ll find yourself following them outside to show it off. \n\nThe Quattroporte (Italian for “four-door”) last received an update in 2013, when it moved to a new platform shared with the shorter, less-expensive Ghibli sedan. Compare the 2015 and 2016 Quattroportes here. It shares some powertrains with the Ghibli, as well, but notably shares some interior parts with Chrysler products, as Maserati is the premium luxury brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. \n\nThe Quattroporte is priced to compete with cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series and Porsche Panamera. I spent a week with a 2016 Quattroporte S Q4 with all-wheel drive and a V-6 to determine whether or not the public’s awe of the Maserati name is at all deserved.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nEveryone who laid eyes on the Quattroporte declared it a beautiful car, without exception: strangers at gas stations, family members, passers-by on the highway. The number of thumbs-up, waves and compliments was truly surprising. But all those compliments seemed to come after observers noticed the trident logos on the C-pillars and grille or the Maserati script on the tail. It lent credence to my observation that the Quattroporte is indeed pretty but no longer remarkable. People love it simply because it’s a Maserati. \n\nWhen the Quattroporte was introduced, its shape was novel and unusual. Since then, other brands have made vehicles that look a lot like the Quattroporte. It’s got a low front end with small headlights and a large oval grille, sweeping back to fenders with Buick-style porthole vents, three on each side. My father actually thought it was a Buick when I pulled up in it. \n\nThe back end has strong, wide fenders and a high deck, but the shapes are no longer unique or unusual; it bears too much resemblance to a Kia K900 in a number of ways. Paint color plays a big part. In my test car’s metallic gray, it’s completely anonymous. Slather it in deep blue, though, like one I happened to pass on the street, and it’s strikingly elegant.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the Quattroporte is a choice of two engines. My test car featured a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that routed power to all four wheels (the Q4 part of the Quattroporte S Q4 name). It’s the same powertrain I sampled in the Ghibli two years ago (see the review) and, just like in the smaller car, it’s perhaps the Quattroporte’s best feature. \n\nWhile the engine block is cast at a Chrysler facility in Kokomo, Ind., that part is then shipped over to Italy where it’s assembled into a final engine by Ferrari. The V-6 makes 404 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque, and it also makes a sound unlike any V-6 you’ve ever heard. Pop the mode selector button into Sport and vacuum-actuated butterfly valves open in the exhaust to allow a rasping bark to escape under moderate throttle. It pops and sings, echoes off walls and other cars, and turns heads as much as it makes you smile. It also propels the big Quattroporte forward at formidable speeds, helping the car feel more athletic than its girth and heft would suggest. \n\nThat said, while the Maserati is no featherweight, it is considerably lighter than its competition. It bests the Mercedes-Benz S550 by 540 pounds and comes in 377 pounds lighter than a BMW 750. The Porsche Panamera is lighter by 110 pounds, but it’s also a smaller car. \n\nThe Quattroporte handles well for such a large car (it’s longer and wider than either the S-Class or the 7 Series), but that’s not to say it’s agile. Ride quality is excellent, with the suspension soaking up road imperfections in true grand touring style. Nicely weighted steering helps the car track true on highways. It’s also quiet and serene inside, with little in the way of road or wind noise to interfere with the Italian opera being piped through the exhaust. \n\nThe shock absorbers can be firmed up with the push of a button, but that really only serves to make the ride more uncomfortable; it doesn’t seem to add any newfound ability to the Quattroporte’s excellent suspension tuning. Braking performance is strong — almost too strong: smoothly managing the last few feet of travel when coming to a stop takes some practice, as the big brakes become grabby at lower speeds.\n\nFuel economy is surprisingly decent for a car this big, even though I tended to run its small, turbocharged V-6 at higher rpm just to hear it sing. My week with the Quattroporte, which included nearly 400 miles of highway driving, netted an average of 22 mpg. The Quattroporte S Q4 is rated a rather poor 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined, making my observed numbers more significant. \n\nThe Maserati’s rating isn’t much different from the competition: The Mercedes-Benz S550 with its twin-turbo V-8 is rated 16/26/19 mpg, almost exactly the same as the BMW 750i xDrive’s 16/25/19 mpg. The lighter, smaller Porsche Panamera 4S is rated 17/27/21 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThough troubling for reviewers like me who sample a lot of cars over the course of a year, the Quattroporte’s biggest problem is not likely to be a concern for most of its buyers. The issue is inside the car and comes in the form of all the Fiat Chrysler parts-bin components I can easily identify. The multimedia system is pure Chrysler Uconnect, down to the fonts used. The window switches are from a Jeep Grand Cherokee, the multifunction turn signal-wiper stalk is from a Chrysler 300 and the steering wheel is the standard corporate part from any number of Fiat-Chrysler vehicles. For $126,000 and change, I expect uniqueness — or at least more distinctiveness than you’ll find in a car costing around $26,000. But I’d wager that most Maserati buyers have never been inside a Dodge Dart and the only time they’ve seen the inside of a Chrysler 300 is from the backseat of the Uber they took to the airport. For them, this will likely feel like pure Maserati style, not obvious cost-sharing. \n\nThat’s because the parts themselves aren’t bad; except for the shifter, everything in the car has a solid, well-crafted feel to it. The electronic shifter itself is garbage. It’s the confusing type, difficult to operate quickly, that has since been recalled on Chrysler 300s, Dodge Chargers and Jeep Grand Cherokees. It springs back to center when pushed forward or back and requires astute attention to confirm what gear you’re in. Designs of this type are still in use on many Audis and Maseratis, however, and from its cheap plastic feel to its damnably infuriating operation, it’s a deal-killer for me in a purchase situation. The shifter also features a tap-shift function for manual operation of the transmission, but it’s so easy to accidentally tap when operating the climate controls or radio that you’ll often find yourself accidentally downshifting. \n\nMy car came equipped with the optional Ermenegildo Zegna special edition interior. It features dark gray Mulberry silk fabric from the world-famous Italian suit-maker as the seat inserts, door panels and headliner material. It looks fantastic against the saddle leather and piano-black trim, making for an impressive dose of style that the 7 Series can’t quite match (though the S-Class can). \n\nThe Maserati’s leather seats are big and comfortable but don’t offer quite the same adjustability (or massage or adaptive cushioning) as the Benz. Backseat comfort, however, is also impressive and easily a match for the Benz or Bimmer, with plenty of legroom for occupants in the stretched chassis. Headroom is also plentiful despite the car’s swoopy roofline and a four-seat option is available if you want to extend the front center console all the way into the backseat. If driving the Quattroporte isn’t your thing, riding in its backseat isn’t a bad alternative.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nCost-sharing is the name of the game for the Maserati brand, which is understandable given the low volume it sells. Why not share some parts with high-volume Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep? As mentioned, the touch-screen multimedia system is Chrysler Uconnect, which means it works well, is simple and easy to use, and responds quickly. The one in my test car, however, seemed to be an older version, as it had problems syncing up with my iPhone 6S. I’d also expect at least a little effort to re-skin the screens used so the system doesn’t look like it came straight out of a car costing 20 percent of the Quattroporte’s sticker price. \n\nThe ergonomics of the rest of the car are a mixed bag. You sit low in the Quattroporte but not low enough to see the tops of the two round gauges in front of you. Adjusting the steering wheel to a mostly comfortable position for me cut off the speedometer between 30 and 120 mph. Thankfully, you can choose to display a digital speedometer between the two gauges; without it, you’d never know your speed. The climate controls are buttons instead of touch-sensitive panels, but they have backlit, white icons that completely disappear in bright sunlight. \n\nThe Quattroporte shows far less attention to the vehicle’s controls and connectivity systems than its rivals do. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Quattroporte’s size enables it to carry plenty of people and stuff. The trunk is a sizeable 18.7 cubic feet, besting the 18.2 cubic feet of the BMW 750i, the 15.7 cubic feet you get in a Porsche Panamera, and the surprisingly small 12.3 cubic feet of the Mercedes-Benz S550. Storage inside the car isn’t as copious, however. A center armrest console is the only place you have to put anything, and there’s only one cupholder per person in the front seat.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Quattroporte has not been crash-tested, but if it eventually is, the results will appear here.\n\nUnlike offerings from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche (and Cadillac, Kia, Hyundai and others), the Maserati Quattroporte doesn’t offer much in the way of electronic safety aids. Blind spot warning, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors are standard, as is a backup camera, but that’s about all you get.  Adaptive cruise control, collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning or prevention — none of it is available on the Quattroporte. \n\nThe S-Class, meanwhile, is a technological marvel that practically drives itself, as is the 7 Series. If having all the latest tech and gadgetry is your goal, the Quattroporte won’t be your choice. See the Quattroporte’s standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nNo, you don’t buy a Quattroporte for its tech, or for its value. The 2016 model starts at $101,700 including destination for a basic, rear-drive S model. Stepping up to the Q4 with all-wheel drive will run you $109,700, while opting for the V-8-powered GTS will set you back $143,300 – and that’s a hefty $16,800 per additional engine cylinder (though it also gets you Maserati’s Skyhook adaptive suspension and a lot of other standard equipment). \n\nMy S Q4 rang in at $129,770 including the Zegna interior package, stitched trident logos on the headrests, piano black-trim, metallic paint, a powered rear sunshade and the Comfort and Assistance Package.\n\nThe competition is formidable and includes some of the most advanced luxury vehicles in the world. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is the benchmark for the segment and, while you can’t get one with a V-6 in the U.S., you get a powerful twin-turbo V-8 for the price of the Maserati’s V-6. In fact, for the price of the Maserati, you can get an S550 loaded with technology, comfort and luxury items that shame the Quattroporte — but you don’t get the Maserati’s exclusivity and you trade off German technological prowess for Italian style. \n\nThe same can be said for the BMW 7 Series, which offers many of the same innovations as the S-Class but is available with a six-cylinder engine. Both the Benz and the BMW can be had with executive rear seating packages, as well, which coddle backseat occupants as if they were in a luxury jet. Like the Mercedes-Benz, the BMW is loaded with technology and luxury features when optioned up to the same price as the Maserati.\n\nWith more compact dimensions inside and out, the Porsche Panamera is more of a sports car than a grand touring sedan like the Quattroporte. It has a wider variety of powertrains, too, and a far larger price span, ranging from a starting price of $79,150 up to nearly $300,000 for a loaded, all-wheel-drive Exclusive Series. The Panamera gets by on its abilities, however, not on its looks; it’s generally considered to be nowhere near as shapely as the Maserati. Compare all four competitors here. \n\nThe Quattroporte is meant to go up against the big dogs from the major luxury marques, but it can’t compete when it comes to technological innovation or safety features. Instead, it makes its mark with style and cachet — whether real or imagined. Time and again, whenever someone asked me about the Quattroporte and I brought up its shortcomings, they invariably responded with “Yeah, but it’s a Maserati!” \n\nYou can’t buy that kind of cachet, but it is very real — and Maserati is counting on it to overcome the Quattroporte’s competitive deficits.",

      "expert_review": "Maserati. Quattroporte. The words roll off the tongue in that unique way that Italian words do, where you almost sing them instead of speaking them. There’s something about the Italian language and cars that inspires a feeling of exoticness, and the Quattroporte does its best to play into that, from its expressive exterior styling to the brash, red leather interior that I found waiting for me inside.\n\nBut dig a little bit past the Quattroporte’s surface and you’ll find that it’s not really exotic at all, but rather a conventional luxury touring sedan with old-school sensibilities.\n\nWhat’s New for 2018\n\nThis generation of the Quattroporte has been around since 2013. Thankfully, it does see a few important changes for 2018 that help to modernize the sedan, especially in the area of safety. Compare the 2018 Quattroporte with the 2017 model here. Those changes drive up the price slightly to $107,400 with destination (an increase of $2,200).\n\nThe updates include a new torque-vectoring system and electric power steering, which allow the sedan to add lane keep assist, active blind spot warning and traffic sign recognition to its suite of available safety technology. Those come as a part of the Driver Assistance Package, which also includes adaptive cruise control and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nAlso changed for 2018 is the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, which gets a bump in power up to 424 horsepower and 428 pounds-feet of torque. That raises the top speed of the Quattroporte S up to 179 mph, according to Maserati.\n\nI tested a Quattroporte S GranLusso, the more luxury-focused of two upgrade packages available for the Quattroporte S. The GranSport offers a sportier take on the sedan. The two have cosmetic differences on the exterior and some equipment divergence inside: The GranSport comes with sport seats and a sport steering wheel while the GranLusso has heated and ventilated front seats as well as a leather-and-wood steering wheel. My test vehicle also came with the Driver’s Assistance Package, upgraded sound system and heated rear seats among a few other options to bring the final price up to $123,330.\n\nGo Big or Go Home\n\nIn addition to the Quattroporte S (rear-wheel drive) and Quattroporte S Q4 (all-wheel drive), there is also a GTS version of the Quattroporte. That gets a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 that makes 523 hp and 523 pounds-feet of torque, and has rear-wheel drive only. Both the S and GTS come with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nMaserati proudly states that these engines are both built by Ferrari at its plant in Maranello, Italy. The engines were co-developed by both companies but are used only in Maserati vehicles. The engines share the same bore dimensions, valve technology and similar turbocharging technology, but the additional cylinders make the GTS a much quicker car with a higher top speed.\n\nIf you want to go smaller, the good news is that the V-6 engine is up to the task of moving of the big Quattroporte S sedan around. Acceleration builds steadily at mid-throttle, and the engine is a willing partner when you put your foot into it. One thing that I did miss was that signature Maserati growl; it’s muted inside, and it doesn’t quite overwhelm outside like I was hoping it would. For the big noise, you’ll have to look at the V-8 in the GTS.\n\nThe Quattroporte’s dynamics tend to err more toward touring than sport. Its performance is acceptable in the corners, but the car’s more comfortable when the roads are straighter. Crank the car up into its most aggressive driving modes and the throttle gets twitchy, but the rest of the car still feels a bit soft. This didn’t really bother me much because of the car’s cruising nature, including its interior.\n\nOld School, New School\n\nThe very comfortable interior’s styling reminded me of old-school luxury vehicles (complete with an analog clock), especially with my test vehicle’s red leather. I’m not sure that I was so much a fan of the cloth inserts found in the seats, but that option can be declined if you’d prefer all leather. It checks all the boxes for what you’d expect out of an interior in this price range: fine materials all around, heated and ventilated front seats, and plenty of legroom for backseat passengers.\n\nSpeaking of the backseat, it’s very comfortable — as long as you aren’t in the middle, which sits higher than the outboard seats and also happens to be right underneath a large dome light in the ceiling. That pinch means there isn’t much headroom to speak of.\n\nThat’s the old school; the new school consists of the technology offerings. Thankfully, Maserati chose to simply use a version of parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Uconnect touchscreen multimedia system that’s a personal favorite of mine. Here, it’s just reskinned and called Maserati Touch Control Plus, but it’s still the same super-easy-to-use, intuitive Uconnect system. It comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity baked in, as well. Between the seats is a secondary control for the system with a dial, but I didn’t really use that at all — the screen is easier to poke at. Bear in mind that the Quattroporte comes with just two USB ports: one up front and the other in the rear armrest when it’s folded down.\n\nThe final new-school element worth a shout-out are the added safety features. The Quattroporte’s integration of its safety technology is well done, and the systems are all easy to turn on and off via a single menu on the touchscreen or the adaptive cruise control buttons on the steering wheel. You’d be surprised how easy it can be to mess up a well-intended safety feature by making the warnings too abrasive or the features hard to access, but the Quattroporte avoids those pitfalls.\n\nThe Quattroporte Isn’t Weak, but Competitors Are Strong\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with the Quattroporte, a competent vehicle with Italian flair that extends beyond its name. The brand still carries cachet and the front grille especially has aged well (I can’t say the same for those fender portholes, however). But it’s playing in a tough division with its six-figure price tag, and my $120,000-plus test vehicle runs up against formidable performance sedans like the BMW M5, Audi RS 7 and Porsche Panamera 4S. Compare the Quattroporte with those vehicles here.\n\nThose three vehicles each run circles around the Quattroporte, performance-wise, and come with luxury in equal measure — especially the M5 that I tested earlier this year, which was so good that it’s seared in my memory as the gold standard for these types of vehicles. I don’t have doubts that a redesigned Quattroporte would be a better, more competitive car in this class, but the 2018 version just feels a step behind.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Maserati. Quattroporte. The words roll off the tongue in that unique way that Italian words do, where you almost sing them instead of speaking them. There’s something about the Italian language and cars that inspires a feeling of exoticness, and the Quattroporte does its best to play into that, from its expressive exterior styling to the brash, red leather interior that I found waiting for me inside.\n\nBut dig a little bit past the Quattroporte’s surface and you’ll find that it’s not really exotic at all, but rather a conventional luxury touring sedan with old-school sensibilities.\n\nWhat’s New for 2018\n\nThis generation of the Quattroporte has been around since 2013. Thankfully, it does see a few important changes for 2018 that help to modernize the sedan, especially in the area of safety. Compare the 2018 Quattroporte with the 2017 model here. Those changes drive up the price slightly to $107,400 with destination (an increase of $2,200).\n\nThe updates include a new torque-vectoring system and electric power steering, which allow the sedan to add lane keep assist, active blind spot warning and traffic sign recognition to its suite of available safety technology. Those come as a part of the Driver Assistance Package, which also includes adaptive cruise control and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nAlso changed for 2018 is the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, which gets a bump in power up to 424 horsepower and 428 pounds-feet of torque. That raises the top speed of the Quattroporte S up to 179 mph, according to Maserati.\n\nI tested a Quattroporte S GranLusso, the more luxury-focused of two upgrade packages available for the Quattroporte S. The GranSport offers a sportier take on the sedan. The two have cosmetic differences on the exterior and some equipment divergence inside: The GranSport comes with sport seats and a sport steering wheel while the GranLusso has heated and ventilated front seats as well as a leather-and-wood steering wheel. My test vehicle also came with the Driver’s Assistance Package, upgraded sound system and heated rear seats among a few other options to bring the final price up to $123,330.\n\nGo Big or Go Home\n\nIn addition to the Quattroporte S (rear-wheel drive) and Quattroporte S Q4 (all-wheel drive), there is also a GTS version of the Quattroporte. That gets a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 that makes 523 hp and 523 pounds-feet of torque, and has rear-wheel drive only. Both the S and GTS come with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nMaserati proudly states that these engines are both built by Ferrari at its plant in Maranello, Italy. The engines were co-developed by both companies but are used only in Maserati vehicles. The engines share the same bore dimensions, valve technology and similar turbocharging technology, but the additional cylinders make the GTS a much quicker car with a higher top speed.\n\nIf you want to go smaller, the good news is that the V-6 engine is up to the task of moving of the big Quattroporte S sedan around. Acceleration builds steadily at mid-throttle, and the engine is a willing partner when you put your foot into it. One thing that I did miss was that signature Maserati growl; it’s muted inside, and it doesn’t quite overwhelm outside like I was hoping it would. For the big noise, you’ll have to look at the V-8 in the GTS.\n\nThe Quattroporte’s dynamics tend to err more toward touring than sport. Its performance is acceptable in the corners, but the car’s more comfortable when the roads are straighter. Crank the car up into its most aggressive driving modes and the throttle gets twitchy, but the rest of the car still feels a bit soft. This didn’t really bother me much because of the car’s cruising nature, including its interior.\n\nOld School, New School\n\nThe very comfortable interior’s styling reminded me of old-school luxury vehicles (complete with an analog clock), especially with my test vehicle’s red leather. I’m not sure that I was so much a fan of the cloth inserts found in the seats, but that option can be declined if you’d prefer all leather. It checks all the boxes for what you’d expect out of an interior in this price range: fine materials all around, heated and ventilated front seats, and plenty of legroom for backseat passengers.\n\nSpeaking of the backseat, it’s very comfortable — as long as you aren’t in the middle, which sits higher than the outboard seats and also happens to be right underneath a large dome light in the ceiling. That pinch means there isn’t much headroom to speak of.\n\nThat’s the old school; the new school consists of the technology offerings. Thankfully, Maserati chose to simply use a version of parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Uconnect touchscreen multimedia system that’s a personal favorite of mine. Here, it’s just reskinned and called Maserati Touch Control Plus, but it’s still the same super-easy-to-use, intuitive Uconnect system. It comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity baked in, as well. Between the seats is a secondary control for the system with a dial, but I didn’t really use that at all — the screen is easier to poke at. Bear in mind that the Quattroporte comes with just two USB ports: one up front and the other in the rear armrest when it’s folded down.\n\nThe final new-school element worth a shout-out are the added safety features. The Quattroporte’s integration of its safety technology is well done, and the systems are all easy to turn on and off via a single menu on the touchscreen or the adaptive cruise control buttons on the steering wheel. You’d be surprised how easy it can be to mess up a well-intended safety feature by making the warnings too abrasive or the features hard to access, but the Quattroporte avoids those pitfalls.\n\nThe Quattroporte Isn’t Weak, but Competitors Are Strong\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with the Quattroporte, a competent vehicle with Italian flair that extends beyond its name. The brand still carries cachet and the front grille especially has aged well (I can’t say the same for those fender portholes, however). But it’s playing in a tough division with its six-figure price tag, and my $120,000-plus test vehicle runs up against formidable performance sedans like the BMW M5, Audi RS 7 and Porsche Panamera 4S. Compare the Quattroporte with those vehicles here.\n\nThose three vehicles each run circles around the Quattroporte, performance-wise, and come with luxury in equal measure — especially the M5 that I tested earlier this year, which was so good that it’s seared in my memory as the gold standard for these types of vehicles. I don’t have doubts that a redesigned Quattroporte would be a better, more competitive car in this class, but the 2018 version just feels a step behind.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
