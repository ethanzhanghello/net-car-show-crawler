      "expert_review": "This will be a quick review in more ways than one.\n\nFirst, I had just 30 minutes with the fabulous 2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore, 15 minutes of which was munched up by intrepid photographer Brandon Lim snapping the lovely photos you see here.\n\nSecond, well … the Folgore is somethin’ else. There’s 751 horsepower and a ridiculous 996 pounds-feet of torque on-tap from this car’s triple electric motors and 92.5-kilowatt-hour battery, giving the Folgore accelerative pressure that’s easily on par with any supercar this side of a half mil. And that’s without dipping your toes into the Maserati’s MaxBoost mode, which temporarily unlocks a stupid 818 hp. Yow.\n\nRelated: 2024 Maserati GranTurismo Review: Beyond Next-Gen\n\n2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nAll of this comes in a wrapper that looks like that — a droptop, four seats and interior appointments that will make you long for a life commuting between Lake Como and the Amalfi coast. Good thing my short exposure was in Monterey, Calif., during Monterey Car Week, where traffic oozes, pedestrians meander and cops exceed their annual ticket quota six billion times over thanks to idiots exercising their 751-hp cosmo-cabrios.\n\nStunning Speed\n\nI thankfully escaped any police presence, but as mind-meltingly gorgeous as is Pebble Beach’s 17-Mile Drive, it’s no place for a full-throttle Folgore pull. I mean, I dared a few, but they didn’t last longer than “Oh dear, that’s fast.” At the risk of employing a corny cliche, it’s shocking speed; our first full-throttle zap in the Folgore had me and Lim looking as if we’d mixed the wrong chemicals together in a lab.\n\nWith MaxBoost engaged, Maserati reports a 2.7-second 0-60 mph pull, and that feels about right. After my time in it, I can claim a 1.5-second “Oh my god” time, a 2.2-second “Wow” scramble and a 4-second “OK, all right, haha, let’s slow down” run. It’s especially unexpected if you’ve driven any manner of GranTurismo in the past — and bonus points if it was the lazy 4.2-liter V-8 previously offered. As neat and elegant as these cars have always been, performers they were not.\n\n2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore, front row | Cars.com photo by Brandon Lim\n\nMostly, old GranTurismos were one of the better ways to turn gas into opera, with Ferrari-tuned V-8s that snarled and gnashed with all the fury of a much, much more powerful car. Now, that mellifluous music is gone, replaced by the Nettuno V-6’s turbo torque in gas-powered cars or the Folgore’s neck-snapping pace.\n\nAn EV Rarity\n\nBased on my brief seat time, the Folgore feels like one of the more special EVs available today, and it’s one of the few performance EV coupes you can buy. Even surrounded by high-caliber cars in Monterey — three Bugattis passed during our photoshoot — the Folgore just felt special. And considering its base price is around $207,000, it should; I’ll need more time with it to decide if your cash is better spent elsewhere, but this is surely a compelling option.\n\nMore Short Trips Than Grand Tours\n\nAs far as grand touring, however, I don’t expect the Folgore will be too grand at it. You’ll burn through that battery in just 233 miles, according to manufacturer estimates; this car is hindered by a 5,000-plus-pound curb weight, sticky tires and thirsty motors. You’ll best enjoy it if you live near a coast or mountain pass, so maybe consider moving to a complementary environment before buying. It’s surely worth it.\n\nMight I suggest Monterey? Just don’t plan on using any of that juice in mid-August during Car Week. \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo: Amore, Now With Fewer Cylinders\nIs the 2024 Maserati Grecale a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 5 Cons\nIs the 2023 Maserati Levante a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nResearch the 2025 Maserati GranCabrio Folgore\nShop for a New Maserati\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
