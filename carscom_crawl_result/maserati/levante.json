      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhat is it: Maserati’s first attempt at an SUV. Competes with: Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, BMW X5, Bentley BentaygaThe ultra-luxury segment has been late to the SUV party, but that’s beginning to change with the launch of the 2017 Bentley Bentayga and now the 2017 Maserati Levante. The Levante, which is scheduled to hit dealerships late this year, is the first SUV from the Italian brand better known for its sports cars. Many of the Levante’s styling cues are borrowed from Maserati’s Ghibli sedan. Both models have pointy headlights, a gaping front grille, portholes on the front quarter-panels and distinctly shaped rear roof pillars that bear the Maserati logo. The rear window is raked forward, increasing the sportiness of the design but reducing potential cargo room.Built in Italy, the Levante will come standard with an air suspension, all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Gasoline and diesel engines will be offered in markets outside the U.S., but it’s unlikely that we’ll see a diesel engine here.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Beautiful, quick and fun to drive, the Maserati Levante Trofeo is an interesting, if imperfect, alternative to more mainstream super-luxury SUVs.\n\nVersus the competition: In its top Trofeo spec, the Levante is a lot more expensive than a comparable Porsche Cayenne or BMW X5 M, but you won’t see another one coming and going at your golf club dinners.\n\nIf you’re shopping for a super-expensive luxury SUV, there’s a plethora of choices and flavors; it seems nearly every luxury brand has one of these high-powered, multipassenger luxo-barges. There’s the BMW X5 M, the Mercedes-AMG GLE63, several spice levels of the Porsche Cayenne, Land Rover’s Range Rover Sport, and Audi will happily sell you a hot new RS Q8. All of these SUVs can be optioned up to high levels of horsepower and fitted with opulent interiors, and all tend to rack up some nice profits for the luxury players. \n\nYou may notice, however, that these SUVs are almost entirely German or British; the Japanese luxury brands don’t have anything comparable, nor do the Americans. But what about the Italians? Shouldn’t a nation known for swanky luxury goods, high style-consciousness and blisteringly fast sports cars have something comparable? Well, it does: the Maserati Levante, tested here in its top-spec Trofeo trim. Short of a Ferrari Purosangue, this is the most luxurious, most capable Italian SUV out there. But is it any good? I drove one for a week to find out if this stylish road rocket — from a storied brand with decades of history — can keep up with its better-known, better-selling competitors. \n\nRelated: 2023 Maserati Grecale Breezes in With Up to 523 Horsepower, EV Model Is Next\n\nGorgeous, But Getting Too Familiar?\n\nWhat’s immediately striking about the Levante is that like most Italian supermodels, it doesn’t have a bad angle. The thing is gorgeous from front to back, from its aggressively deep, straked grille and feline headlights to its pronounced rear fender haunches and quad exhaust tips poking out from below the rear bumper hinting at what’s under the hood. My only complaint is that it’s a look becoming a bit too familiar, as Mazda has pretty much co-opted the same style for its newest SUVs. (Tell me you don’t see the Mazda CX-50 in this Maserati’s front end.) If you were to scale up Alfa Romeo’s Stelvio SUV, you’d see it has basically the same shape and body — unsurprising given Alfa Romeo, like Maserati, is part of the Stellantis family of brands. The new Maserati Grecale, a smaller compact SUV that slots below the Levante (and shares a platform with the Stelvio), is a bit more differentiated. Given the Levante has a few years on it now — it was first introduced in concept form as the Kubang in 2011 — a restyling is likely in the next few years.\n\nNo matter; imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the fact that other brands are aping the look of the Levante and other Maseratis is high and worthy praise. The Levante may have a traditional two-box design, but it’s muscular, sleek and has details like “vent ports” on its front fenders designed to make it feel aggressive and powerful even if it’s just rolling through a Taco Bell drive-through. \n\nThe Trofeo I drove was outfitted with black-painted 22-inch wheels and tires that filled out the wheel wells nicely. The options list included glowing Rosso Magma red paint that, for literally $17,000, should have had a lot less orange peel in the finish than it did. Not great, that. Given the overall price of the Maserati Levante Trofeo (more about that in a moment), the paint should be flawless and the interior should be a luxurious knockout. \n\nToo Much Stellantis Inside?\n\nStep into the Levante’s cabin and you’re greeted by two competing schools of thought. First, shapes and materials in a car like this should be exotic, top quality and impressive. Second, as one of more than a dozen brands under Stellantis’ huge umbrella, Maserati is bound to do a fair bit of parts sharing. The first one is only moderately well executed: Yes, there’s some really beautiful quilted leather, a lovely faux-suede Alcantara headliner, and some racy shapes and designs that imply luxury. The gauges — actual round dials, not just a big digital screen — are beautiful to behold, and all of the dash and door leather is stitched straight and true. But there’s also an unpleasant amount of cheap-looking carbon-fiber trim, which stopped feeling upscale the minute it appeared in an average Kia many moons ago.\n\nThe other idea — that parts sharing is bound to happen — is proved in the buttons, switches and screens that adorn the Levante’s interior. The stalks and window controls are straight out of a Jeep Grand Cherokee, as are the climate-control buttons. I posit, however, that this isn’t really a bad thing; the switches feel just fine, and the likelihood of anyone cross-shopping a six-figure Maserati and a Grand Cherokee are remote enough to make this detail unimportant. As long as the controls look and feel suitably expensive (and they do), who cares what other vehicles they appear in? Especially if customers are never going to see them anyway. \n\nAnother good example of this is the Levante’s 8.4-inch touchscreen, which runs a Maserati-themed version of Stellantis’ ubiquitous Uconnect multimedia system. It’s still one of the best, easiest to use, most clearly presented and quickly functional multimedia systems on the planet. Tarting it up with Maseratiness works just fine. \n\nComfort and visibility, however, are another matter. The front seats are dynamite — supportive and fantastic-looking — but they’re not overly bolstered. Their leather pattern just oozes Italian tradition; the central horizontal stitch pattern has appeared in Ferraris for some 60 years now, and it looks just as good here as it does there. The backseat features adequate legroom and headroom, but there’s also an odd seat-bolster shape that puts a strange padded section right on the tailbone of anyone sitting back there. It makes for a decidedly uncomfortable lump in one’s lower back; my backseat passengers complained about it immediately. If they’d been back there for anything more than a quick jaunt to dinner, it would have been a serious issue. \n\nAlso coming up a bit short in the Levante is manufacturer-estimated cargo room, which checks in at just a smidge more than 20 cubic feet. That’s well short of what competitors from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche offer. It likely has something to do with the SUV’s rather high load floor, but if carrying either lots of people or cargo is something you’ll need to do with your high-performance SUV, you’ll be better served elsewhere. The Levante takes care of whomever’s sitting up front, but anyone in the back (and their stuff in the cargo area) will not be looked after as well. \n\nThat’s OK, the Point Is to Entertain You\n\nSince when have comfort and utility been reasons to buy a luxury anything? It’s always better to look good than to feel good, right? Well, you will indeed look good in a Maserati Levante Trofeo, and as long as you’re in the driver’s seat, you’re going to feel pretty good, too. At the very least, you’re going to find yourself massively entertained because this SUV is made to move. \n\nIt starts with the same Ferrari-built twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 engine that’s under the hood of other Trofeo-trim Maseratis, including the Ghibli and Quattroporte sedans. In the Levante Trofeo, it makes 580 horsepower and 538 pounds-feet of torque, with power sent to all four wheels through standard full-time all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. It makes the kinds of noise you’d imagine a compact, high-strung Italian V-8 would make — and it makes even more of it when you adjust the drive mode from Strada (Street) to Corsa (Race). Acceleration is fierce, but the suspension is soft enough to allow the rear to squat some when you punch it, making it feel even quicker than Maserati advertises (0-60 mph in 3.8 seconds, it says). The transmission is beautifully matched to the V-8, never second-guessing or finding itself in the wrong gear. You can shift it yourself with Maserati’s huge fixed-position flappy-paddle shifters behind the steering wheel, but I felt no need to do so. \n\nI’ve never been a big fan of the idea of a high-performance SUV; I’ve thought of them as overpowered, oddly tuned status symbols meant to part rich folks from their money and unlikely to see a racetrack or even be driven athletically. The Levante Trofeo falls into this category (having a “race” mode on any five-seat family SUV is pretty ridiculous regardless of powertrain), but of all the examples I’ve driven, the Levante is one of the more entertaining — likely because it doesn’t feel as tall as many other SUVs. A lower center of gravity and seating position help it feel more like a Quattroporte wagon than a tall-riding SUV, and that comes through in its demeanor. The Levante turns with the same skillfulness as it goes straight, with flat, beautifully controlled body motions augmented by the excellent feel and feedback you get through the steering wheel. It feels athletic, urging you to take corners faster and get on the gas more forcefully — to actually enjoy your commute or carpool duties. The suspension is tuned quite well, too, with a “Skyhook” air suspension that’s adjustable for firmness depending on drive mode. It soaks up bumps nicely, never really upsetting the cabin even on rough pavement. \n\nThe only area not quite up to snuff athletically are the brakes, which are a bit soft and mushy, making for stops that can be jerky and less smooth than one would like. And why on Earth is there an off-road mode? Between the Levante’s lack of underbody protection, its sticky high-performance all-season tires on big wheels and an utter lack of all-terrain pretense, I doubt any Levante will be challenged by anything more than a gravel path to an equestrian center. \n\nA Quirky Alternative to the Mainstream\n\nWhat we’re left with in the Levante is a stylish, genuinely athletic and fun-to-drive Italian-fashioned SUV that needs an interior upgrade to truly match its asking price. Like most of its competitors, the Levante has a massive price spread: In the U.S., a base 2023 GT trim level with a 345-hp V-6 starts around $92,000 (all prices include destination). The slightly nicer Modena model comes in about $10,000 more, the V-8-powered Modena S rings in around $129,000, and the top Trofeo model starts at nearly $169,000. The 2022 Trofeo I tested started lower, but with every option available it rang in at $173,550 — considerably more than you’d pay for competing vehicles with more customization and technology options. \n\nYou have to really put some stock in the Maserati name to pay that kind of money for a Levante, and I’m not sure the brand has that level of cachet these days. The addition of new models like the MC20 and MC20 Cielo sports cars, plus the upcoming GranTurismo Folgore all-electric coupe, should go a long way toward reenergizing the Maserati brand, as may its vehicle customization program. Until then, the Levante Trofeo remains a flawed, fun, expensive luxury SUV that brings a little Italian style into an otherwise heavily German segment. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Maserati GranTurismo: Amore, Now With Fewer Cylinders\nWhat Is Stellantis?\nResearch the 2023 Maserati Levante\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a New Maserati Levante\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Mercedes-AMG GLS 63, BMW X5 M\n\nLooks like: A slightly less opulent Levante Trofeo\n\nDrivetrains: 550-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8; eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealers: Likely late 2018\n\nMaserati is gunning for Porsche directly with the latest model to join the Levante SUV lineup: the 2019 Levante GTS. Slotting in just below the Trofeo, it uses the same twin-turbocharged engine but in slightly less powerful form, giving Maserati a price-competitive luxury SUV meant to go head-to-head with the Porsche Cayenne Turbo (whereas the Turbo S will likely stack up against the Trofeo more directly). We recently got an up-close look and brief spin in the Levante GTS at the M1 Concourse private racetrack in Pontiac, Mich., a fun introduction to this latest entry into an increasingly competitive segment.\n\nRelated: Maserati Levante: Can This Exotic SUV Handle a ‘Merican Road Trip?\n\nExterior\n\nOn the outside, the new GTS looks like the rest of the Levante lineup — curvy, angular, sleek and rakish, with obvious ties to the rest of the Maserati family. The changes to make a GTS are subtle and focused mainly on the lower front and rear bumpers. The front is redone with a new lower design that features two aerodynamic wings, and the rear has added a new horizontal element meant to emphasize the SUV’s width.\n\nFull matrix LED headlights are optional. Quad exhaust tips are present out back, as well. On the GTS, specifically, a chrome front grille with chrome surround, body-colored door handles, spoiler, front splitter and rear extractor, and piano-black inserts in the bumpers distinguish the GTS. A subtle GTS badge on the rear hatch confirms what you’re looking at.\n\nInterior\n\nThe cabin is an opulent place, full of leather, wood and aluminum detailing. A full single-stitched leather interior is standard on the GTS in either black, red, tan or beige, or opt for the Pieno Fiore double-stitched premium leather in black, red or tan. The steering wheel and all of the seats are heated, with the front seats ventilated, as well. There are some large aluminum paddle shifters behind the steering wheel, and the GTS includes sport pedals, unique gauges, illuminated door sills, and velour floormats. A 900-watt, 14-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system is standard, as is the Maserati Touch Control Plus multimedia system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen (which you might recognize as a slightly redone Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Uconnect system).\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPowering the Levante GTS is a slightly detuned version of the twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 found in the Levante Trofeo that was unveiled at the New York Auto Show earlier this year. It makes 590 horsepower in the Trofeo, but has been retuned to make 550 hp in the GTS. It’s mated to an excellent ZF eight-speed automatic transmission, after which power is routed to all four wheels.\n\nA standard mechanical limited-slip differential is fitted, as is Maserati’s unique Skyhook electronic adjustable suspension. The transmission lever is new for 2019, and now allows for selecting a manual or automatic mode by sliding the lever left and right. This has eliminated the “M” button on the transmission and now allows for selecting Sport mode and Skyhook modes independent of the transmission mode, says Maserati.\n\nThe suspension is largely the same as other Levante models but features tuning unique to the GTS in order to impart a more sporting character. The Skyhook adjustable dampers also adjust ride height, optimizing the vehicle’s height for various conditions (not that you’re ever likely to take this off-road). At its most aggressive, it can lower the GTS by 3 inches from its highest point, suitable for track duty (not that you’re ever likely to take this on a track).\n\nThe GTS features 20-inch wheels as standard, with new 21-inch or 22-inch forged wheels as an option. The brakes have been upgraded to painted six-piston calipers up front on 15-inch discs, with 13-inch discs in the rear.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI was able to get a few laps on a soaking-wet M1 Concourse track in the new GTS between rain squalls, but this is perhaps really the best way to test a new Maserati SUV. The V-8 in the Levante isn’t a big one at just 3.8 liters, but you’d never know it when you punch up that starter button. It makes big engine noises, and when you’ve put all the settings into sport modes, it roars down the track like the true Italian motor it is. It’s a glorious noise, accompanied by a seamless rush of power and a throttle response that’s astonishingly dialed in given that this is a heavy SUV. \n\nFCA seems to be getting quite good at making its big SUVs go really fast around a track, having successfully done so with the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio. The Maserati Levante GTS is no different; while nobody likely will ever drive one of these luxurious, expensive machines in anger around a road circuit, it can be used for such duty if needed — enjoyably at that. Maserati says that the GTS can get from zero-to-60 mph in just 4.0 seconds, which is exceptional for an SUV that weighs more than 4,700 pounds. \n\nBoth the new Levante GTS and Levante Trofeo are expected to be available late this year.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Maserati Levante combines stout performance with mass-market attributes thanks to Maserati’s ties to parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. More often than not, those family ties work in its favor.\n\nVersus the competition: Much like other six-figure SUVs, the Levante is athletic and luxurious. But it also makes passing grades on utility and practicality, which sets the Maserati apart from many of its ilk.\n\nThe Levante hit the market two model years ago as Maserati’s first SUV, built on a platform shared with the Ghibli and Quattroporte sedans. For 2019, the Levante adds a turbocharged V-8 engine that slots above the carryover turbo V-6. Between the two engines, the Levante offers four output levels across eight trims, all with standard all-wheel drive. Compare the variants here, or stack up the 2018 and 2019 Levante here. We evaluated both the V-6 and V-8 variants, including the performance-topping Levante Trofeo on Wisconsin’s venerated Road America racetrack.\n\nSpeed, Solidity\n\nPower came in a burst of high-revving thrust from the V-6 example we tested in 2018, a 424-hp Levante S. (The base Levante, which we haven’t evaluated, makes 345 hp with the V-6.) From a stop, power builds readily enough to scoot the Levante S to 60 mph in a manufacturer-estimated 5 seconds flat, but it’s a peaky experience you sometimes have to wait out in the midst of normal driving and passing. It might help if the standard eight-speed automatic transmission downshifted more swiftly, but it’s merely adequate in this regard.\n\nOpt for the V-8, and the sprint takes just 4 seconds in the GTS (550 hp) or 3.7 seconds in the Trofeo (590 hp). I noted some accelerator lag off the line in a GTS in Normal driving mode, but a selectable Sport mode improves on that. Trofeo models add a harder-core mode called Corsa. Lag aside, power comes early enough that both the GTS and Trofeo can pile on speed regardless of gear or rpm.\n\nThe V-8, which displaces just 3.8 liters, remains on the peakier side: It can flex some low-end torque if you keep modest pressure on the gas, but it shows its best stuff if you don’t hold back. Go hard on the gas, and revs build quickly as the Levante’s V-8 storms toward redline, wailing exhaust and all. I came nowhere close to the Trofeo’s top speed, a Joe Walsh-approved 189 mph, but flying down Road America’s straightaways at something north of 100 mph, the Levante’s stability felt unflappable. Brake hard from such speeds and the SUV feels reasonably planted, with confident stopping power and linear pedal feel. Most trim levels share the Trofeo’s brakes, which feature monster 15-inch front discs and Brembo six-piston calipers.\n\nThe Levante’s standard all-wheel drive defaults more power to the rear wheels, and it’s enough to slide the tail a little sideways if you pile on the gas around a tight bend. The chassis doesn’t beg to be rotated — the rear kicks around in halting, tentative motions before the stability system reins it back in — but it’s evidence enough of the SUV’s rear-drive bias. Sustained curves exhibit minimal understeer, and both the steering ratio and overall feedback are engaging enough, if less visceral than in the Stelvio SUV from fellow FCA brand Alfa Romeo. A mechanical limited-slip rear differential is standard in the Levante, but active torque vectoring — the sort that overdrives the outside wheel to aid cornering — is unavailable.\n\nIndeed, outside its high-rpm power and sound, very little about the Levante shrieks “performance.” The steering wheel turns with a lighter touch than you’d expect from a performance SUV, and ride quality during a 530-mile road trip in the GTS was firm but livable. (Air springs and adaptive shock absorbers are standard across all grades, but V-8 models have unique tuning.) That trip returned 19.7 mpg in mostly highway driving and warm temperatures, with normal driving modes and about 20 minutes’ idling at a rest stop — significantly better than the GTS’ EPA-estimated highway rating of 18 mpg. Maserati’s Highway Assist System, an option on the Levante, faithfully centered our test car in its lane all the way down to a stop, though only on GPS-tracked highways. To our frustration, it doesn’t help steer on “unapproved” roads as some vehicles do.\n\nQuality, Quantity\n\nWe’ve chided FCA before for throwing the same interior controls into some Maseratis as it does into numerous Jeep and Dodge products, and the Levante is no different. The window switches are chrome-flecked versions of what’s in a Cherokee or Charger; the seat-heater buttons for the backseat are straight out of Chrysler’s 2000s-era parts bin. Still, if you consider the alternative from sibling brand Alfa Romeo, which has layouts that are unique but defy logic, I welcome Maserati’s approach.\n\nThough it’s marketed as a Maserati Touch Control Plus display, the Levante’s touchscreen is FCA’s familiar Uconnect dashboard. It sports Maserati-specific graphics but the same intuitive menus and functionality, complete with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. An armrest-level controller offers two concentric knobs for volume and tuning duty, and a medium cubby ahead of it accommodates cellphones and parking passes. The setup isn’t perfect, but it’s logical. That’s a quality missing in too many luxury cars these days.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard. Various upgraded hides and wood or carbon-fiber trim — the latter offered in a three-dimensional, textured weave — are optional, as is extended leather for much of the dashboard and doors (a vinyl dash is standard). The extra cowhide looks handsome, though cheaper plastics on lower portions of the B-pillars expose some cost-cutting amid the finery. In this price range, you get to nitpick.\n\nOverall space is unremarkable given the Levante’s mid-size footprint. Some drivers may find knee clearance pinched up front, but the chairs are comfortable over long trips. The backseat is a bit low to the floor and suffers an overstuffed lower backrest, but legroom is acceptable. The fixed head restraints block visibility out a rear window that’s small to begin with, but the Levante’s large side mirrors redeem some of that.\n\nThe $164,000 Question\n\nIf you think a six-figure SUV should be different — in its controls, interior layout or styling — there’s a Tesla or Porsche or Land Rover for you. The Levante’s mass-market familiarity will turn off some shoppers, and perhaps some of its most outdated aspects should. But it’s extraordinary in many other ways, and the fact that it’s also reasonably practical is icing on the cake. Is it prosaic to fixate on such aspects in a car that runs from just south of $80,000 to well over double that? Sure, but that’s what sets the Levante apart.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
