      "expert_review": "Envoy XUV misses the mark\n\nThe all-new 2004 GMC Envoy XUV is one of those vehicle concepts that sounds great, on paper, but whose execution leaves much to be desired.\n\nWhat sets the Envoy XUV apart from the competition is a sliding rear roof and tailgate that turn this sport utility vehicle into a faux pickup with an open cargo bay, but enclosed rear windows. The XUV also features a sliding ‘midgate’ that seals off the rest of the cabin from the rear cargo compartment and the outside elements.\n\nThe base two-wheel-drive Envoy XUV starts at $31,925. We tested a four-wheel-drive Envoy XUV with up-level SLT trim and a price tag of $42,285.\n\nHE: There’s not much I like about the Envoy XUV, which is a subpar product in many ways. In truth, it’s a compromise vehicle that’s a lousy compromise. It’s not a good utility vehicle and it’s not a good pickup. And that’s really surprising, considering that General Motors Corp. makes some of the best trucks in the business. If you want an SUV, you’re far better off with the regular Envoy or long-wheelbase Envoy XL. If you want a full cabin with four doors, but occasionally need the cargo-hauling capability of a pickup, you’re considerably better off with a GMC Canyon Crew Cab or even a Chevrolet Avalanche.\n\nSHE: I think you’re being way too harsh. The Envoy XUV is not the type of vehicle you’d buy if you’re a building contractor because the bed is way too small. But I still see it as a really cool vehicle for weekend warriors like me, whose idea of fun is going to the Home Depot. I’m not going to haul a full-size tree in my XUV, but I am going to load it up with all kinds of indoor and outdoor project stuff to keep me occupied between writing assignments.\n\nHE: So why wouldn’t you just buy a crew-cab pickup? You can still hose out the bed after hauling whatever, and there’s really no compromise. Plus you don’t have to fiddle with buttons, switches or key fobs to open or close roofs and windows. The XUV just seems like an awful lot of fuss and bother for very little additional payoff. Fortunately, the Envoy XL chassis on which it’s based is a good one. With a very long wheelbase and Bilstein gas shocks, the ride quality is exceptional. You’d almost never guess you were in an SUV. But that generous wheelbase comes with a penalty, a wide turning circle that makes parking and tight maneuvers a real chore.\n\nSHE: I was impressed with the wide running boards on the XUV. They make getting in and out of the truck much easier. The seats are comfortable, and I love the idea of seat belts built into the front seats. The cabin is actually quite nice, too, and so is that silvery-sage exterior paint scheme.\n\nHE: I’ve always liked the tasteful nickel trim in the Envoy. But I was less impressed by the unsightly gaps where the edges of the instrument panel meet the bottoms of the windshield pillars. Individual interior modules also look like t hey were designed to plug into the instrument panel with plenty of margin for error, a ‘coarse fit’ method, rather than the seamless fits and tight, smooth edges that you find on most European and Japanese products in this price class. Speaking of prices, did it dawn on you that you could buy a luxury SUV, like a BMW X5 or a Porsche Cayenne, for the same money as our test vehicle?\n\nSHE: I would never haul dirt in a Cayenne or an X5. I did have some other problems with the Envoy XUV. If you look over your shoulder, the thick side pillar creates a major blind spot when you’re backing up or trying to change lanes on the freeway. The rear compartment needs some kind of cargo-management system to keep grocery bags from sliding all over the place. I thought the vehicle felt almost tippy when we went around some corners a little faster than we should. And I was disappointed that, even with the base six-cylinder engine, the city fuel economy is only 15 miles per gallon. More importa tly, if you intend to use this as a family vehicle, there is no air-bag protection for rear-seat passengers and no rear-seat entertainment system.\n\nHE: Like I said, not much of a compromise. Or perhaps too much of one. I could deal with some of the smaller annoyances, like a key fob that didn’t always provide the “one-touch” function as promised. But I think the last straw was when I opened the window a crack about 10 minutes after the rain stopped, and all of a sudden water started pouring over the roof drip rail and through the window. Considering you can get a new Chevrolet Equinox or a GMC Canyon Crew Cab for half the price, and they’re both better products, I’d urge you to steer clear of the Envoy XUV.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Envoy XUV sport utility vehicle illustrates the maxim that many new ideas can be traced back to the past. The Envoy XUV’s most compelling feature is a retractable rear roof � a convenience that was available in the early 1960s on the Studebaker Wagonaire station wagon.\n\nTouching a button converts the XUV’s cargo area from fully enclosed to an open-air space. When the rear roof is fully retracted, a 32-by-32-inch opening allows tall objects to be carried upright.\n\nInside, the midgate features a powered glass panel that raises or lowers via a push-button. When the glass is raised, the passenger compartment is separated from the cargo section. When the glass is lowered, the rear seats can tumble down and the midgate can flip down, which provides an extended cargo bed.\n\nA QuickDrain system in the cargo area can channel out as much as 30 gallons of water per minute. Wet or dirty messes can simply be hosed away.\n\nFor 2005, a Generation IV version of the available 5.3-liter V-8 operates with Displacement on Demand technology to improve fuel economy. A passenger-sensing system goes into the right front seat, and General Motors’ OnStar communication system gains upgraded hands-free capability. The XUV comes in SLE and SLT trim levels.\n\nExterior\nBuilt with body-on-frame construction, the Envoy XUV looks similar to the Envoy XL; however, the XUV has this unique power-sliding rear roof. An electronically controlled rear load-leveling suspension is optional. Mounted on a 129-inch wheelbase, the XUV measures 208.4 inches long overall. Cast-aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires. A dual-function tailgate that drops down or swings open is installed, and the cargo area can hold 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets with the tailgate down.\n\nInterior\nAs many as five occupants can fit inside the Envoy XUV. According to GMC, the seats and midgate can be reconfigured in seconds without tools. Four tie-down rings can be moved to any of 12 locations in the cargo area.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Envoy XUV’s standard 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder produces 275 horsepower. The optional 5.3-liter V-8 has Displacement on Demand technology and makes 300 hp and 330 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed-automatic transmission serves both engines, which run on regular-grade gasoline. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Envoy XUV is enjoyable to drive and steers with a light touch. You feel all the rough spots on bumpy pavement, but few are bothersome. The Envoy XUV also handles nicely for a truck � and it seems more carlike than some SUVs.\n\nAcceleration with the six-cylinder engine will be eager enough for most drivers. The six-cylinder responds fairly quickly at higher speeds, if less so at lower velocities. Hard downshifts at lower speeds can produce engine blare.\n\nComfortable seats offer adequate support but not much side bolstering. Except for limited knee space in the second row, the XUV has a roomy interior. It’s the retracting rear roof that makes this vehicle special.",
