      "expert_review": "THE GMC Sonoma wouldn’t start. Blown fuse. I felt sorry for thelittle truck. All of the neighbors saw it arrive. They were impressed.It was pretty with its slanted front end and end-capped rear bumpers.The paint job, silver and red beneath a clear polyurethane coat, wastops. The interior, the most car-like of any pickup I’ve driven, wasinviting. But the darned thing died in the driveway.\n\nIt didn’t just die. It loudly announced its demise. It cranked, wentvarrrooommm. Then pitter-patter, cough, choke. Nothing. Fuel-pump fusefried. No pump action, no fuel. No fuel, no go.\n\nAll of which was too bad, because the 1994 GMC Sonoma is one of thebest compact pickup trucks available. But people see what they see; andwhat they saw was a pretty General Motors truck that wasn’t goinganywhere.\n\n“American quality, eh?” a neighbor asked.\n\nNot really. These things happen — like the gear-shift knob that cameoff in my hand in a 1994 BMW 5-series car; like the tested 1993 ToyotaTercel that couldn’t stay straight in panic stops; the tested 1993Jaguar with a faulty fuel gauge; and the upper interior, driver’s-sidedoor panel of a 1993 Mercedes-Benz S-class car that dislodged itselfalong with its accompanying power-seat control buttons.\n\nAnyway, GM fixed the Sonoma’s fuse — and the crimped wire thatcaused it to blow. I headed toward the Shenandoah Valley, where the fallleaves were bright crimson and orange. It was a beautiful, trouble-freedrive.\n\nBackground: The Sonoma was introduced in 1982 as a rear-wheel-drivepickup. Changes have come almost every year since then, including in1991, when the little truck’s designers went on a romp and produced thehigh-performance Sonoma Syclone.\n\nBut the 1994 truck is best of all. It’s tighter and quieter than anySonoma ever built. It’s wider than previous models by nearly two inches.But interior space, enhanced by redesigned doors and windows, includesan extra three inches of shoulder room and modest increases in head andhip room.\n\nStandard features include side-door guard beams, power steering,heavy-duty shocks, 15-inch wheels/tires, anti-lock brakes and afive-speed manual transmission on most models. A four-speed automatic isoptional.\n\nSeven different suspension systems, affecting ride and handling, areavailable for the Sonoma, which can be bought as a rear-wheel orfour-wheel-drive pickup. There are three wheel-bases, ranging from 108.3inches to 122.9 inches; two cab styles, regular and extended; twocargo-box sizes, six feet and 7.4 feet; and three trim, or decorativestyles, the base SL, tested SLS and luxury SLE.\n\nThe test truck was equipped to haul a maximum payload, the maximumallowable weight of cargo a vehicle can carry, of 1,519 lbs. It couldpull a trailer weighing up to 6,000 lbs.\n\nBuyers with serious off-road intentions can opt for the specialSonoma Highrider.\n\nComplaints: Besides the startup glitch, there’s the two angled jumpseats in the Sonoma SL S extended cab. No adults should use them on anytrip more than two blocks long.\n\nPraise: An excellent overall compact pickup truck, both in terms ofdesign and construction. It replaces the Ford Ranger as my favorite inthis product segment.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Highly attractive, moving or standing still.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Superior small-truck ride andhandling. Excellent acceleration. The tested rear-wheel-drive Sonoma SLSextended cab was equipped with an optional 4.3-liter V-6 rated 165horsepower at 4,000 rpm, with a maximum torque of 235 foot-pounds at2,400 rpm. That engine is standard on four-wheel-drive Sonomas. BaseSonomas get a 2.2-liter, four-cylinder engine rated 110 horsepower at5,200 rpm, with a maximum of 130 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 rpm.\n\nBraking was excellent. Standard brakes include vented frontdiscs/rear drums with rear-wheel anti-lock backup. A four-wheelanti-lock system is standard on four-wheel drive models.\n\nMileage: bout 18 miles per gallon (20-gallon tank, estimated348-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running mostlyhighway and driver only without cargo.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette withgraphic equalizer, by GM/Delco. Good.\n\nPrice: Base price for the tested Sonoma SLS is $12,113 with a dealerinvoice of $10,962. Price as tested is $15,133, including $2,550 inoptions and a $470 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with any compact pickup at any price.It’s a buy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA third door is now standard on all extended-cab versions of GMCs compact Sonoma pickup truck, which is the corporate kin to the Chevrolet S-10. All Sonomas for 2002 have air conditioning and a tachometer, and chrome grille trim has been added to the SLS trim package. The SLE trim level has been eliminated. The two-wheel-drive, regular-cab, long-bed truck has also been dropped, so all regular- and extended-cab Sonomas now have a 6-foot bed.\n\nSonomas sold in selected northern states now include a Cold Climate option group. New options include a bed extender for all models and a hard, lockable tonneau cover for Crew Cabs, which can also be fitted with Graphite leather-trimmed interior.\n\nGMC added the Crew Cab body style for 2001 to match Chevrolets comparable S-10. Crew Cab models, which have four conventional doors that open to the front, have four-wheel drive and a 4.3-liter V-6 engine, but other Sonomas may be equipped with a four-cylinder engine. Sonomas come with either rear-drive or 4WD, and a manual shift or a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nArchrival Fords compact Ranger, in extended-cab form, comes only with two narrow back doors that open toward the rear. Four-door Crew Cab body styles are available on the Dodge Dakota, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma.\n\nExterior\nSonomas come in three sizes. The regular-cab model is 190.6 inches long on a 108.3-inch wheelbase, while extended-cab pickups ride a 122.9-inch wheelbase and measure 205.3 inches long overall. Crew Cab models have the same overall length as the extended-cab versions, but because more space is devoted to the rear doors, the Crew Cabs cargo bed shrinks to 4.5 feet from the usual 6-foot length. Extended-cab trucks can be equipped with an optional third door, and 4WD extended cabs can have the ZR2 High Rider Package, which includes a ZR2 decal.\n\nPayloads range from 1,111 pounds for the Crew Cab, which comes only with V-6 power and 4WD, to 1,389 pounds for a 4WD extended-cab model. Sonomas can haul trailers that weigh as much as 6,000 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab and extended-cab models may have either a front bench seat that holds three people or a pair of bucket seats. Two folding rear jump seats are standard in extended-cab models, but the one on the drivers side is eliminated if an optional third door is installed. Sonoma Crew Cab pickups are equipped with the front buckets and a three-place rear bench. A stereo radio with speed-sensitive volume and an in-dash six-CD changer is optional in all models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 120-horsepower, 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is standard on 2WD models. A 4.3-liter V-6 power plant is standard on 4WD trucks and optional on 2WD versions. The V-6 engine produces 180 hp in the 2WD installation and 190 hp with 4WD.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. However, the Crew Cab model comes with the automatic only. All 4×4 pickups use General Motors Insta-Trac system, which is engaged using a switch on the dashboard; an electronic transfer case permits shifting in or out of 4WD High on the move. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The GMC Sonoma has been around since 1982 and it seems to get better with each model year. For 1996, the compact truck gets options like a third door on extended cab models, a revised sport suspension and more powerful V-6 engines.\n\nSo why did Anita give it only one star? Read on . . .\n\nHe: That little Sonoma with the five-speed and the big V-6 was so much fun to drive, I almost miss our old Ranger Splash.\n\nShe: I miss our Splash, too. In fact, the picture is still up on our fridge. You’ll notice I haven’t even taken one snapshot of the plain black Geo Prizm we bought to replace it. But I’m a lot more comfortable with having my kids in the Prizm than the old Ranger for one overriding reason: It didn’t have a passenger-side air bag. And that’s the exact reason why I can’t, in good conscience, recommend the Sonoma, especially when there are so many cute compact trucks out there with two air bags.\n\nHe: Easy solution. Just never drive with any passengers.\n\nShe: Exactly. If you can live with just having a driver-side air bag, this is a great truck. It has the chunky appearance of a Tonka toy, and it certainly outpowers most other compact trucks with its 4.3-liter engine. But if you are at all aware of what’s going on with side air bags, you’re going to be too far ahead of the curve on safety to feel secure in this truck. And I know GM’s rationale – that the second air bag isn’t required by the government on trucks for another year or two.\n\nHe: Finished with the safety soapbox, mom? Let’s talk about stuff that real truck drivers care about, like power. You can get the V-6 in two different versions, with up to 190 horsepower. In the configuration we had – standard cab, short bed – the big six and the five-speed make a dynamite combination. Plus, the truck’s so light, your gas mileage doesn’t suffer much. The EPA numbers on this model are 18 city and 25 highway. And we haven’t even talked about the slick SLS package.\n\nShe: I hate to remind you that a lot of real truck drivers are women and before you talk about any slick packages, my advice to them is forget the glitz and go for the practical. If you do decide on a Sonoma, get one with what they call the “side access panel,” which is a little third door on the driver’s side of the extended cab models. It makes the Sonoma a better car substitute. The side access panel wasn’t on the version we drove and I missed it. It makes it much easier to to get at stuff in the back seat.\n\nHe: Boy, are you cranky today. Back to the SLS. It’s a $2,000 package that includes the V-6, sport suspension, aluminum wheels, sport bucket seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and a few other goodies like fog lamps. I was pleased that the sport suspension didn’t feel nearly as harsh as the one on our old Splash. The manual gearbox also lends an element of entertainment that tends to be missing in many of these trucks.\n\nShe:Entertainment, nothing. It lends an element of savings. The automatic transmission adds more than $1,000 to the sticker price.\n\nHe: What I meant was the Sonoma SLS that we drove reminded me a little of the early Toyota and Datsun compact trucks back in the Seventies. Not that it’s primitive by any means – not with $4,000 worth of options including air conditioning, full power accessories and a fancy stereo. However, it’s still a great value for $17,000 in today’s money.\n\nShe: You’re right, I am cranky. I still don’t understand why GM was thoughtful enough to make safety items like antilock brakes and daytime running lights standard on the Sonoma, but couldn’t get it together to do the second air bag. That’s my backward way of trying to be fair on the safety issue, by the way.\n\nHe: Here’s the corporate logic: It’s a lot cheaper to add daytime lights and ABS than it is to retool a whole instrument panel to add the second air bag. But you’re right, that still doesn’t justify GM’s decision. If GM had had oresight to put two bags in the Sonoma when they redesigned the truck for 1994, I’d be inclined to give it four stars. It really is one of the most fun-to-drive vehicles you can buy for under $20,000, without scrimping on the amenities.\n\nShe: My only other gripe about the Sonoma is the sport suspension. Some people may find that it bucks a bit too much. It seemed pretty harsh to me. But the truck had plenty of power for passing and merging and one we drove with the six-foot bed was easy to park. You can also get a version of the Sonoma with a seven-and-a-half foot bed, depending on how much mulch and marigolds you want to haul. You can also get it in four-wheel drive, if you live out in the country or you’re worried about getting through snow. If you want to go whole hog, plan on spending upwards of $25,000, which is twice the base sticker price.\n\nHe: Call me Mr. Cheap, but I’d be happy with this truck just the way it is – with a second air bag, of course. If you’re riding in the passenger seat, does that qualify?\n\n1996 GMC Sonoma SLS\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger compact pickup.\n\nPrice: Base, $12,552; as tested, $17,246 (inc. $485 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: Sport suspension option, improved V-6 engine.\n\nStandard equipment: Power steering, power brakes, AM-FM stereo, tinted glass, dual outside mirrors, 19-gallon fuel tank, intermittent wipers, full carpeting, painted rear step bumper, lighted visor vanity mirrors.\n\nSafety features: Driver-side air bag, antilock brakes, side impact beams, daytime running lights.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Marketing option package, including SLS sport decor, sport suspension, aluminum wheels, high-back front bucket seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, tachometer, air deflector, fog lamps, Vortec 4300 engine ($2,057), air conditioning ($805), power windows/locks ($535), tilt steering column and cruise control ($395), AM-FM stereo cassette ($282), remote keyless entry system ($135).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V-6; 170-hp at 4400 rpm; 180 lb-ft torque at 4400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nCompetitors: Chevrolet S10, Ford Ranger, Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Pickup, Mazda B-series, Isuzu Hombre.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 108.3 inches; overall length, 189.0 inches; curb weight, 2930 pounds; legroom, 42.4 inches front; headroom, 39.5 inches front; shoulder room, 57.2 inches front.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,031.Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Used to be that two-seaters were exclusively sports cars, but nowadays many of the two-seaters we see prowling the roads are compact pickup trucks.\n\nWhy are they so popular? In may ways they have taken the place of sports cars because they’re fun, different and an expression of individualism, if you will. Plus, they can be used for light hauling, should the need arise.\n\nWith the sports-car image in mind, GMC has come up with a ZQ8 suspension package for the two-wheel-drive Sonoma that tames most of its truck vices and serves up handling more at home on a twisty road than a construction site. It drives like you’ve welded a pickup bed onto the back of your Firebird.\n\nThe sports suspension package consists of 8-inch wide aluminum wheels, Goodyear Eagle GA tires and recalibrated springs, shocks and anti-roll bars. Structural reinforcements in the form of a center driveshaft bearing support and a single-piece rear shock absorber cross member keep the frame from flexing, which helps keep the wheels in solid contact with the road. Even the power steering gets more road feel and a quicker ratio.\n\nThe optional 4.3-liter V6 engine is mandatory with the sports suspension package, but you’d want that anyway for this kind of a truck.\n\nSince the GMC and Chevrolet compact pickups are nearly identical, Chevy has a similarly equipped S-10 for diehard Bowtie fans.\n\nI was skeptical about the handling improvements until I tackled my favorite strip of abandoned, curlicue asphalt road and found that the Sonoma could be hustled through turns almost as confidently as a muscle car. The back axle hopped around a little, but for the most part its behavior in turns was friendly and benign.\n\nIt was during this little exercise that I realized that this 175-horse engine gets a bit noisy and coarse when revved to 5,000 rpm or so. Prior to that I had not been revving it hard because it produces maximum torque, or pulling power, at only 2,800 rpm, and that means you tend to shift early and let the engine pull without winding it up like a rubber band.\n\nThe five-speed transmission is de rigueur for back-road follies, but this one is not the smoothest. The foot-long shift lever seems to transmit lots of vibration and noise into the cabin when you’re using the engine to its max. With that in mind, I would forego the five-speed’s versatility and choose the automatic for everyday use.\n\nOne important feature of our extended-cab test truck was the optional third door. Located on the left side, it swings out easily for putting dogs, kids or groceries behind the front seat. The extra space is pretty tiny, and the fold-down seat is only good for a very small child, but the practicality of the extended-cab makes it the overwhelming choice.\n\nThe rest of the cabin is rather small compared to a full-size truck, but for daily commuting, or use as a second car, it fills the bill. It has bucket seats and a center console with cupholders a nd storage pockets.\n\nAt this time there is not yet an airbag for the passenger side, which means you could safely put a young child or safety seat there.\n\nThe Sonoma’s instrument panel is still not as thoroughly refined as it could be. While its instrumentation is cleanly designed, some of its secondary switches, such as those for the headlights, click noisily and feel rough.\n\nPrice\n\nSome Sonomas, including the model I drove, recently had a $100 price hike. The base price is now $14,814. Our test vehicle was equipped with options of air conditioning, tilt wheel, cruise control, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, AM/FM stereo with compact disc player, V6 engine, sports suspension, sliding rear window, third door, tinted glass, leather-wrapped steering wheel, locking differential and remote keyless entry.\n\nThe sticker price was $20,028.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long st drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: If you want a compact truck with the personality of a sports car, pick the Sonoma with the sports suspension package and you will be pleased.\n\nCounterpoint: The manual transmission is a bit noisy, as are some of the switches on the dash.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.3-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 122.9 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,168 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $14,814\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $20,028\n\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 25 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "This is the unknown soldier in the GM truck lineup as the Chevy S-10 usually steals the attention.\n\nLots of good features, including optional third door ($295) on driver’s side for easier entry/exit into the back of this extended cab; push-button four-wheel-drive; passenger-side air bag on/off switch with an easy-to-see-light advising whether it is on or off; and enough cupholders for a family sedan.\n\nThe drawback is that there is precious little room in back even for an extended cab, and the one relegated there must use a jump seat. (Hmm, one jump seat but two cupholders in back?)\n\nAmple power from the 4.3-liter, 190 h.p. V-6, which is rated at 16 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway.\n\nBase price: $20,015. The test vehicle added 4-speed automatic for a whopping $1,070; air conditioning for $805; power windows/door locks/mirrors; remote keyless entry for $795; AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player and clock for $402; tilt steering and cruise control for $395; aluminum wheels for $280; tinted glass for $115; and leather-wrapped steering wheel for $54. Add $520 for freight.\n\nGet option-happy and the out-the-door price is going to approach that of the Blazer sport-utility.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC fires another salvo in the pickup truck door wars with a crew-cab version of its compact Sonoma. Chevrolet also offers a crew-cab version of the similar S-10 pickup.\n\nBoth GM brands previously offered extended-cab models with a rear-opening third door on the drivers side. Crew cabs have four conventional doors that open to the front. Sonoma and S-10 crew cabs are available only with four-wheel drive and a 4.3-liter V-6 engine. The rival Ford Ranger, the best-selling compact pickup, offers dual rear doors that open toward the rear. Four-door crew cabs also are available on the Toyota Tundra, Nissan Frontier and Dodge Dakota compact pickups.\n\nExterior\nWith the addition of the crew cab, the Sonoma now comes in four sizes. The regular cab is 191 inches long with a 6-foot cargo bed and 207 inches long with a 7.5-foot cargo bed. The extended cab comes with the 6-foot bed and is 205 inches bumper to bumper. The crew cab has the same overall length as the extended cab. But with more space devoted to the rear doors, the cargo bed shrinks to 4.5 feet.\n\nInterior\nBoth regular-cab and extended models can have either a front bench seat that fits three people or a pair of bucket seats. Two folding rear jump seats are standard on extended-cab models, but the one on the drivers side is deleted from versions with the optional third door.\n\nThe crew cab comes only in the top-shelf SLS trim with front buckets and a three-place rear bench.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 120-horsepower 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is standard on two-wheel-drive models. A 4.3-liter V-6 is standard on four-wheel-drive models and optional on 2WDs. The V-6 rates 180 hp with 2WD and 190 hp with 4WD.\n\nThe 4x4s use General Motors Insta-Trac system, which has an electronic transfer case that allows shifting in or out of 4WD High on the move with a dashboard switch.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "GMC’s Sonoma Crew Cab is one of the latest to join the fast-growing ranks of four-door pickup trucks that function as much like a small sedan as a truck.\n\nWith four regular-size doors and a back seat big enough to accommodate adults, the Sonoma Crew Cab is ideal for personal use. It can be a truck when you need to haul something, but the rest of the time is has an interior like a compact SUV.\n\nThe back doors simplify access to the back seat as well as the installation of child safety seats. Most trucks today find their way to the shopping mall as often as they do the lumberyard, which is why a bigger cab and smaller bed make sense. Tubular bed extenders that pivot out onto an open tailgate can be installed to create a longer cargo area for those rare occasions when hauling is actually required.\n\nDespite the Crew Cab’s bed being only 4 feet, 6 inches long, it has a good deal of functionality. Tie-down loops are included for securing items, and indentations in the bed enable boards to be inserted to create two-tier hauling.\n\nA bed liner to protect from scratches is standard. A step built into the rear bumper makes loading easy, plus it will hold a hitch for pulling trailers up to 3,500 pounds. An optional weight-distributing trailer hitch boosts towing capacity to 5,900 pounds.\n\nThe Crew Cab’s cargo payload rating is 1,125 pounds, and that is adequate for hauling a couple of dirt bikes, a lawn tractor or enough lumber to refurbish your workshop.\n\nApart from the addition of a back seat, the Crew Cab’s interior is basically unchanged from the standard Sonoma. The instrument panel has clear and readable gauges, while secondary controls are housed in a center section that is angled slightly toward the driver so they are closer at hand. Textures and ergonomics, however, are not as good as in some newer vehicles. This year, the doors lock automatically at 15 miles per hour, and the buyer can decide whether one or all four doors unlock once the key is removed.\n\nFront seat belts are built into the seats, so they are always adjusted right regardless of seat position or the size of the occupant. Child safety seat tethers are provided, and the passenger-side airbag can be turned off should it be necessary to carry an infant or a child seat in front.\n\nOne of my major complaints relative to the interior: The catalytic converter requires a hump in the floor in the passenger’s footwell, and although it’s not huge, it does get in the way.\n\nThe 4.3-liter V6 is rated at 190 horsepower for four-wheel-drive models and 180 horsepower for two-wheel drive. While this is certainly adequate power for most applications, this engine is fairly noisy. Coolant should last for 150,000 miles and the first tuneup is scheduled at 100,000 miles in normal service.\n\nThe automatic transmission is quite smooth, and selecting four-wheel drive is done electronically with a button on the instrument panel.\n\nBrakes are disc on all four wheels and anti-lock is standard.\n\nPrice The base price of our test truck was $25,083. Options included the 3.42 rear axle ratio, locking rear differential and the cold climate package.\n\nThe sticker price was $25,746.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, e-mail tstrongman@kc.rr.com.\n\nPoint: Four doors and an adult-size back seat make the Sonoma Crew Cab a good alternative to the Sonoma extended-cab truck because it can hold four or, possibly, five people. Counterpoint: The cabin is not very wide, the hump in the floor can be annoying to passengers and interior ergonomics could be improved.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V6\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nFour-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 122.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,039 lbs.\n\nBase price: $25,083\n\nAs driven: $25,746\n\nMpg rating: 15 city, 18 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "The 1998 GMC Sonoma pickup truck, cousin to the Chevrolet S-10, comes withdual air bags to protect driver and passenger.\n\nIt also comes with a passenger-side air-bag cutoff switch. If an infantcarrier is going to be placed on the passenger seat or if you are going totransport your favorite pet (dogs, cats should ride in the cargo bed, ofcourse), the bag can be turned off to prevent injury to the seat’s occupant.Or, if no one is in the seat, you can turn it off so as not to run up therepair bill in a collision when two bags would deploy if the switch isn’tused.\n\nHowever, we’ve just spent far more time writing about the passenger-sidebag and the cutoff switch than GMC spent in designing a useful system.\n\nTo alert the driver and passenger that the bag is off, a light on thekeylock used to deactivate the bag lights up to say “off.”\n\nOn the ’98 Sonoma extended cab we tested, however, the “off” light wasblocked by the steering column. Couldn’t see the light. It wasn’t until wedropped an envelop on the floor and stooped over to pick it up at the stoplight that we noticed the light was on and the bag was off.\n\nGMC (and Chevy S-10) engineers need to redesign the system–pronto.\n\nThe Sonoma extended cab we tested is roomy and comfortable, though more sofor the driver than the passenger who is forced to rest his or her feet on thecatalytic converter bulge in the passenger’s side floor. When the engineersredo the light maybe they’ll redo the converter, too.\n\nThe suspension on this pickup was on the soft, car-like side to keep roadharshness out of the cabin upfront and in the rear, where a fold down jumpseat is housed to hold a child.\n\nTo get in back there’s a side access, or third, door on the driver’s side.To open it you must first open the driver’s door to expose the access doorhandle. That third door runs $375.\n\nSome nice touches included huge outside mirrors for excellent side and rearvisibility, especially useful for truck buyers who might carry cargo in thebed someday; side-vent rear windows; a pair of power plugs under theinstrument panel along the floor to handle accessories; 1 1/2-inch longer seatbottom cushions for improved thigh support on long drives; and push-button 4WDactivation.\n\nGMC placed a storage tray in the center console in front of the gearshiftknob to give occupants a convenient mini storage area, but being housed behindthat knob sacrifices lots of convenience.\n\nThe Sonoma we tested was powered by the higher-output (190 h.p./245foot-pounds of torque versus 180 h.p./240 foot-pounds of torque) version ofGM’s 4.3-liter V-6 rated at 16 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway with an optional4-speed automatic with overdrive. A 5-speed manual is standard.\n\nBase price for the 4WD extended cab: $19,773 with our test unit adding$1,602 for a marketing option package including SLS sport decor, upgradedAM-FM stereo with ca ssette and clock, aluminum wheels, the high output V-6,air conditioning, tilt wheel and speed control; $1,070 for the 4-speedautomatic; and $510 for freight.\n\nTo save some dough you can go two-wheel-drive and get a 2.2-liter, 120-h.p.4-cylinder. But the first time 6 inches of snow fills the road or that roadtakes a 30-degree path skyward, you may have wished you stuck with 4WD and theV-6. Also, towing capacity with the 4 cylinder is 2,000 pounds, but 6,000pounds with the V-6.\n\nLook for Sonoma to undergo its next styling change in 2001 as a 2001 or2002 model. At that time the converter hump sticking up like a volcano on thepassenger’s floor is supposed to be removed after only a little more than 15years of consumers having to put up with it.",
