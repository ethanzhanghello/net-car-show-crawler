      "expert_review": "New name, new van — that’s the story on GMC Truck Division’s Savanna.\n\nAs a full-size van, its predecessors roamed the highway under the name Rally/Vandura. For 1996, it’s been changed to Savana.\n\nWhen they offer a new van at GMC, the division does more than just change the name. The makers of Savana, which begins production in January, decided the vehicle that was introduced as a maxivan 25 years ago needed an overhaul for 1996.\n\nOne thing that hasn’t changed is that the Savana is big. Available in wheelbase lengths of 135 inches and 155 inches, this vehicle will not only carry Mom, Pop, the kids and a large dog, but most of the neighborhood as well.\n\nIts construction is a true truck design. The van features a separate, rugged steel ladder frame that provides a rigid backbone for the body. The body itself is an equally rigid, welded steel structure.\n\nThe Savana’s styling is about as aerodynamic as you can get in a vehicle such as this. Fender corners are rounded, the windshield raked, solar glass and door handles are flush-mounted.\n\nAdmittedly, it isn’t going to fly with the ease of a sports car. But then, you can’t carry up to 15 people in a sports car, either.\n\nFor those who just want to haul cargo, there is a maximum of 267 cubic feet of volume in the short wheelbase van. The extended version has 317 cubic feet.\n\nSavana comes in three series — G1500, G2500, and G3500 — with the 2500 and 3500 series available in both wheelbases. As might be expected, gross vehicle weight ratings go up with size and power increases.\n\nThe weight rating ranges from 6,100 pounds for the G1500 to 9,500 pounds for the G3500. For really heavy hauling, a 454-cubic-inch (7.4- liters) Vortec V-8 engine or a 385-cubic-inch turbo diesel has a towing capacity of 10,000 pounds in a G3500 van.\n\nAlong with a new design, the Savana gets a 262-cubic-inch (4.3-liter) Vortec V-6 base engine that’s good for 195 horsepower. Renamed the Vortec 4300, it features a number of improvements for 1996.\n\nThe V-6’s fuel injection system has been upgraded to a sequential delivery design that uses six micro injectors to replace the one injector that was centrally located within the intake manifold.\n\nThe intake manifold also is a new design. Other changes include a more efficient air flow, more rigid mounting for engine driven accessories, a stiffer cylinder block, and improved engine cooling.\n\nThe Savana isn’t meant to be an engineering exercise in powerplant design. It is meant to be a people mover and, in that respect, the van is going to earn pretty high grades.\n\nWith that in mind, designers made the front wheelhouses and engine covers smaller to improve vehicle access and legroom.\n\nThe front seats slide through a greater range of fore and aft travel. A handy dash-mounted entrance and exit assist handle is provided for the front seat passengers. Middle and rear bench-type seats slide on a built-in track for easy adjustment or removal.\n\nRear-mounted heat and air-conditioni ng systems are available as options. In addition, swing-out side windows enhance the Savana’s ventilation.\n\nFor the rear, the designers created a pair of hinged doors that swing open a full 180 degrees. This provides unrestricted access to the cargo hold. When the doors are shut, the hinges are hidden behind close out panels.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSavana is a full-size van that duplicates the offerings in the Chevrolet Express lineup. Savana comes in two sizes, passenger and cargo versions, and five engine choices. All versions of the Savana, which is built from a full-frame truck design, have rear-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nRegular-size models have a 135-inch wheelbase and overall length of 219 inches. Extended models are 20 inches longer in both dimensions.\n\nRear doors that swing open 180 degrees are standard on all models. Swing-out side doors on the passenger side also are standard, and a sliding door is a no-cost option. A driver-side sliding door is not offered on Savana or Express.\n\nInterior\nRegular-size passenger models come standard with seats for eight (two front buckets and two three-place bench seats), but seats for five are optional and a four-passenger rear bench seat can be added to boost capacity to 12. On extended models, seats for 12 are standard and seats for 15 are optional.\n\nBuyers of cargo models have two choices: standard front buckets and the option to remove the passenger seat (and the passenger-side-impact airbag).\n\nUnder the Hood\nEngine choices start with a 200-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6, the standard engine on regular-size models. Two V-8s are optional on regular-size models, a 5.0-liter with 220 horsepower and a 5.7-liter with 255 horsepower. On extended models, the 5.7-liter V-8 is standard. A 7.4-liter V-8 with 290 horsepower and a diesel 6.5-liter V-8 with 195 horsepower are optional on heavy-duty models (three-quarter and one-ton payloads).\n\nWith all engines, a four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Antilock brakes are standard on all models. Trailer-towing limits range from 4,700 pounds on regular-size models with the V-6 to 10,000 pounds on heavy-duty extended models with the 7.4-liter V-8.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "If the longest extended-wheelbase minivan just isn’t big enough, or if a front-wheel drive minivan just won’t do, there still are a few of the big ones left.\n\nFord makes the Club Wagon. Dodge has the Ram Van. And General Motors offers the Chevrolet Express and this week’s test vehicle, the GMC Savana.\n\nIn fact, they don’t come much bigger than the Savana. It has a giant 135-inch wheelbase, can haul up to 7,100 pounds of cargo and is as comfortable and well-behaved as your average full-size car.\n\nIn fact, the Savana’s size makes it very versatile. For instance:\n\n— This is the ideal vehicle for soccer moms who have to transport the whole team — as well as all the equipment.\n\n— This is the ideal vehicle for the business owner who needs to move people and cargo comfortably.\n\n— This is the ideal vehicle for those who like to travel and prefer to stay with their vehicle. The Savana can be outfitted easily with custom equipment and turned into a mini-motorhome.\n\nI logged 1,000 miles on the Savana in one day on a trip from Baltimore to Orlando, and I can tell you that this is a great vehicle for driving across the country.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nGMC offers the Savana with a choice of five engines, ranging from a 200-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 to a 195-horsepower, 6.5-liter turbodiesel.\n\nOur test van came with GM’s 245-horsepower, 5.7-liter, gasoline V-8 engine and four-speed automatic transmission. I found that this drivetrain provides excellent all-around performance in the city and on the highway.\n\nAcceleration at all speeds is strong and quick. Even under heavy loads, the engine runs smoothly and quietly.\n\nThe more economical V-6 probably would be best for drivers who use the van mostly in the city. Any of the gas-powered V-8s would be good for combined city and highway driving because additional horsepower aids acceleration. And the turbodiesel would be the best engine for drivers who use the Savana for long-distance driving. The 31-gallon tank and more than 20 mpg would allow the diesel Savana to go more than 600 miles between fill-ups.\n\nSavana’s long wheelbase and 6,000-pound weight make for a very smooth and stable ride.\n\nOn the way down Interstate 95, where traffic moves at about 75 mph in most places, the Savana was steady as a rock. Even passing tractor-trailer trucks didn’t generate enough turbulence to make the Savana flinch.\n\nThe power-steering system is light and responsive. But the van has a 45-foot turning radius, so you can forget about any sharp turns. You also may encounter some difficulty with U-turns and angling for a space at the local Wal-Mart.\n\nThe front disc/rear drum brakes are excellent. The anti-lock system kicks in smoothly and stops the Savana without fuss.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWhen you spend nearly 15 straight hours behind the wheel of the same vehicle, you get a crash course in its weak points.\n\nThe Savana doesn’t have many.\n\nIt would be nice if the air condi tioner blew stronger. One more notch on the dial to make the fan turn faster is all it needs. The inside is so cavernous that it takes a powerful fan to move air around in there.\n\nBecause of the design of the two rear doors, there’s a fairly large blind spot in the center of your line of sight out the rear. If GMC engineers could reduce the size of the door frames, rear vision would be much better.\n\nOther than that, there’s a lot to like about the Savana. It is much like a small Winnebago — well-equipped and easy to drive.\n\nThe front bucket seats offer excellent lower back support. The cloth upholstery is durable and attractive. The fold-down arm rest makes cruising long distances about as easy as leaning back in an easy chair.\n\nAll the controls are an arm’s length away, so it is easy to adjust the radio or air conditioner or set the cruise control without taking your eyes off the road for more than a second or two.\n\nGetting in and out is generally easy, although some shorte r drivers may find it a bit awkward climbing into the seat. There’s no such problem in the rear, where a sliding side door allows rear passengers to get in and out easily.\n\nNice touches include the two cup holders and a storage bin in the center of the dash and the roof-mounted controls for the rear air-conditioning system. Vents in the roof blow cold air down on the two rows of seats.\n\nThose seats, by the way, can be removed, making the Savana into a cargo van big enough to swallow couches, motorcycles and other very large items.\n\nOur test van ran perfectly and had no flaws that I detected. If you need a very large vehicle but don’t want to drive a pickup truck, the Savana deserves serious consideration.\n\n1998 GMC SavanaBase price: $22,825Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes and daytime running lightsPrice as tested: $29,332EPA rating: 14 mpg city/18 mpg highwayIncentives: 1,000\n\nTruett’s tip: The Savana is an excellent people and cargo mover. It can seat up to 15 people and carry as much as a pickup truck. The big van is smooth, quiet and reasonably quick.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Savana is available in quarter-ton, half-ton and one-ton weight classes, in regular- and long-wheelbase form, with five engine choices. These variations come in four different van models: cargo, 15-seat passenger, conversion and cutaway. Competitors include the Dodge Sprinter and Ford E-Series.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe 2010 GMC Savana gains three flex-fuel engines. Savana 2500 and 3500 models also receive a new six-speed automatic transmission and revised rear axles.\n\nExterior\nThe Savana’s front end has a trapezoidal grille with a large GMC badge and upscale reflector headlights. Passenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. Regular-length passenger and cargo vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. Side access panels, which offer access to either side of the van, feature remote releases and are available on work-oriented models. The regular-length Savana G1500 measures 224 inches long overall, while the G3500 extended-length van rides on a stretched, 244-inch body. The regular-length Savana is almost 10 inches longer than the E-Series and almost 10 inches shorter than the Sprinter. All Savanas are 79.4 inches wide, which is about the same as the E-Series and Sprinter.\n\nStandard 17-inch steel wheels on G1500 and H1500, with 16-inch steel wheels on the 2500 and 3500\nOptional 17-inch aluminum wheels on G1500 and H1500\nChrome Appearance Package offers front/rear chrome bumpers and grille, with dual composite halogen headlamps\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo vans seat a maximum of two people. The Savana’s maximum interior cargo volume (on the cargo model) is 225.1 cubic feet for regular-length models and 261.6 cubic feet in extended-length vans. That’s about the same cargo capacity as the E-Series, but pales in comparison with the Sprinter’s 318 cubic feet of interior volume.\n\nAvailable new remote vehicle start\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard vinyl seats\nOptional cloth seats\nAvailable power locks and windows, tilting steering wheel and cruise control\n\nUnder the Hood\nLight-duty G1500 vans have rack-and-pinion steering, while G2500 and G3500 vans have integral power steering. The rear suspensions use a semifloating axle with multi leaf springs and gas shocks. The Savana can be equipped with one of five engines. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n250-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\nFast idle option on 6.0-liter V-8 allows heavy-duty accessory usage at idle\nQuieter alternator\nNew six-speed automatic transmission for 2500 and 3500 models\n\nSafety\nThe Savana received a host of safety upgrades for 2008, including side curtain airbags for the first three rows of passenger models. Also, 12- and 15-passenger models have three-layer glass that helps reduce the risk of ejection during an accident. Additional standard safety features include:\n\nDriver and front-passenger airbags\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability control (on passenger models)",
