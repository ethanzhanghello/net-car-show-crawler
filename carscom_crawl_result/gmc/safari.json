      "expert_review": "It’s easy to overlook – or even have a field day criticizing – the 1997 GMC Safari SLT AWD mid-size van.\n\nThe Safari’s looks haven’t changed much since its original design in 1985 and it has been a bit slow to catch up to competitors. It doesn’t have a fourth door and unless you get the all-wheel-drive package that we had on our $30,560 test vehicle, you must settle for rear-wheel drive. And because it’s based on a truck chassis, not a car like many minivans, it drives like a truck.\n\nWhew. But don’t stop reading. If you’re towing a big boat or camper or regularly take your three kids plus grandparents to Walt Disney World on vacation, you may want to take a hard look at the Safari, which can seat up to eight people. We did – and at least half of the family was sold on it.\n\nHe: I sure wasn’t sold on it and I didn’t even have to go as far as Disney World to make up my mind. I drove it from Detroit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. The cramp in my left foot from having no space whatsoever on the driver’s side was enough to convince me.\n\nShe: You’re blaming the Safari for your big EEE feet? Now that’s fair comment and criticism. I agree that it is a little bit of a squeeze up there in the driver’s seat, but if you’re a short-legged, 5-3 person like me, you’re probably not going to suffer too much. Besides, I’ve seen the caravans down I-75 at Easter and Christmas vacation. Nine times out of ten, the woman is driving and the guy is snoring in the passenger seat.\n\nHe: I’m sorry, but I’m not one of those enlightened buyers who have discovered the dubious joys of owning and driving a Safari or its counterpart, the Chevrolet Astro. OK, the all-wheel-drive option is a great feature and I don’t even mind the truck chassis. With the big 4.3 V-6, you can tow a pretty sizable boat or trailer. But I have to tell you, driving the lumpy Ohio Turnpike, it didn’t take long for me to develop a case of nausea to go with my leg cramps.\n\nShe: I’ll admit that I wasn’t running out to the driveway to coo over the Safari. It’s tall and boxy and doesn’t have a lot of personality. But I kept thinking about our neighbor Donna, a person I really admire. She’s on her second Safari. I consider her a really salt-of-the-earth person who looks for functionality in a product and wants to keep the family together. That means a van that can not only haul her kids, but their friends, too. When’s the last time you tried to cram seven or eight people in a Caravan?\n\nIf you don’t believe me, look at the stats. The shoulder room alone in the center and rear of the Safari is 67 inches! That’s spread-out time.\n\nHe: I remember driving our family of four plus your parents and all our luggage in a competitor’s vehicle – one of those front-wheel-drive car-based minivans. I think we were pretty miserable and cramped after just a couple hundred miles, weren’t we? So the passengers will probably appreciate the extra space in the Safari, even if the driver has no place to put his or her feet. Another gripe I have is with the step-in height. I’m over 6 feet tall and it’s still a chore to climb in and out of the Safari.\n\nShe: You need to exercise more. You know what they say, climb stairs and you’ll stay out of the nursing home. I didn’t have any problem and neither did great-grandma, who is almost 96. Besides, I loved riding up higher than a typical minivan. But you do have to adjust your driving a bit because this is not a car. I noticed it going around curves. If you’re not cautious, it does feel tippy.\n\nHe: Another problem I noticed was passing trucks on the turnpike. I’d stomp on the accelerator and there’d be a noticeable lag before the V-6 kicked in. The 4.3 is a pretty powerful engine. It makes 190 horsepower, but I wonder if you really need the extra space and the towing capacity, why wouldn’t you just buy a full-size van? You can get a V-8 in one of those and I’ll bet the sticker price would actua be less. A lot less than the $30,000 sticker on our Safari test vehicle.\n\nShe: That was a bit pricey, I agree. But most Safari buyers settle for the slightly less deluxe SLE package that costs around $25,000. You’ll just have to figure out if you really can’t live without the $950 leather seats or the $309 heavy-duty trailering equipment.\n\nThank God GMC included antilock brakes as standard. If they are committed to families, though, I admit I was a bit disappointed that they’d make them pay extra for stuff like rear air conditioning and even earphone jacks. To me, earphone jacks, which basically keep your teen-agers happy with their music while you listen to Dr. Laura, are standard items, not options.\n\nHe: Anybody who is goofy enough to listen to Dr. Laura probably won’t mind paying all those thousands of dollars extra.\n\nGMC Safari SLT AWD\n\nType: All-wheel drive, seven-passenger mid-size van\n\nPrice: Base, $21,902; as tested, $30,560 (includes $585 destination charge minus $700 option package discount)\n\nWhat’s new for ’97: Leather seat option with SLT package, illuminated entry system, daytime running lights, speed-sensitive power steering, new exterior colors, optional Homelink three-channel door opener transmitter\n\nStandard equipment: Front air conditioning, driver and front passenger lumbar adjuster, power rearview mirrors, AM/FM stereo, digital clock, energy-absorbing steering column, 15-inch aluminum wheels, trip odometer and tachometer, intermittent wipers, leather-wrapped steering wheel, power door locks, power windows, remote keyless entry, tilt steering wheel\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, seat belts, side-door guard beams, daytime running lights, antilock brakes, child lock for sliding side door\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Marketing option package-1SF ($5,646) includes SLT decor, roof-mounted luggage carrier, six-way power driver’s seat, lower swing-out rear Dutch doors with liftgate with remote release and rear washer/wiper, seven-person seating arrangement; leather seating ($950); front and rear air conditioner; AM/FM stereo/cassette ($507); heavy-duty trailering equipment ($309); locking rear differential ($252); 6-way power passenger seat ($240); rear-window defogger ($154); rear radio control and earphone jacks ($125); Homelink three-channel door opener ($107)\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/19 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V-6; 190 hp at 4400 rpm; 250 lb-ft torque at 2800 rpm\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nCompetitors: Ford Aerostar, Ford Windstar, Dodge Caravan\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 111.0 inches; overall length, 189.8 inches; curb weight, 4,427 pounds; legroom, 41.6 inches front/36.5 center/38.5 rear; headroom, 39.1 front/37.9 center/38.7 rear; shoulder room, 64.0 inches front/67.1 center/67.1 rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $926.\n\nWhere built: Baltimore\n\n* Rates based o n an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is age 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike the similar Chevrolet Astro, the Safari is GMCs long-lived midsize van. Both vehicles were introduced back in 1985 as GMs response to the debut of Chryslers front-wheel-drive minivans a year earlier. The truck-based Safari remains available in passenger and cargo-carrying versions, in SLE and upscale SLT trim levels and with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Chevrolet also offers the front-drive Venture minivan, but GMC has nothing smaller than the Safari.\n\nFor 2002, the Safaris 4.3-liter V-6 engine has gained a new multipoint fuel injection system and lost its exhaust gas recirculation system. A rear heater, gray cloth seats and remote keyless entry are now available for cargo versions.\n\nGMC sells far fewer Safaris than Chevrolet does with its Astro, but GMC fans tend to be loyal to the brand. Sales dropped dramatically in 2001 to just 18,533 units  a decrease of 43 percent.\n\nExterior\nAll Safaris ride a 111.2-inch wheelbase and measure 189.8 inches long overall  the same size as the Astro. A regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long as the Safari, while the Dodge Grand Caravan measures 11 inches longer. But at just under 75 inches high, the Safari is 6 inches taller than either Caravan model.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side of the Safari. Side-hinged, swing-open cargo doors at the rear are standard. Rear Dutch doors, which are standard on the passenger-carrying SLT and optional on the SLE edition, consist of a swing-up rear window on top and twin, swing-out, half-height doors below. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door arrangement.\n\nInterior\nEight-passenger seating is standard in the SLE and SLT. Rear occupants get a pair of three-passenger benches in the SLE, while the step-up SLT edition is equipped with split-back bench seats with folding armrests and a center console. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the SLT puts two second-row buckets in place of the bench, and a bench seat at the rear. The Safari offers 170.4 cubic feet of cargo space with the second- and third-row seats removed.\n\nAll versions have power windows, door locks and mirrors, as well as a tilt steering wheel and cruise control. Vans equipped with automatic power door locks also have remote keyless entry. The SLT adds aluminum wheels, as well as such convenience features as rear air conditioning and a six-way power drivers seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll Safaris carry a 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine that mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A Tow/Haul mode in the transmission promises the best shift points when hauling heavy goods or towing a trailer or boat. Safaris have payload ratings between 1,527 and 1,677 pounds, which depends on the model. Towing capacities range from 5,200 to 5,800 pounds.\n\nOptional AWD ordinarily sends full engine power to the back wheels. When the wheels begin to slip, the system automatically delivers power to the front wheels until the Safari is able to regain traction. Antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBecause of their size and configuration, the Safari/Astro duo occupies a distinctive niche in the minivan market. Evaluated by size and overall driving feel, the Safari and Astro look and behave more like a scaled-down GMC Savana or Chevrolet Express full-size van than front-drive minivans. Despite recent refinements and a healthy helping of comfort and convenience features, their RWD or AWD layouts inevitably produce more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a front-drive minivan.\n\nFor burly hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Safari serves as a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more at ease in a conventional, front-drive minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike many General Motors products, the midsize, truck-based GMC Safari is a near-twin to the Chevrolet Astro. GMC sells only about one-third as many Safaris as Chevrolet does with its Astro, but GMC fans tend to be loyal to the brand. Both vans arrived on the scene way back in 1985 as GMs response to the debut of Chryslers front-drive minivans a year earlier. Chevrolet also offers the front-drive Venture minivan, but GMC has nothing smaller than the Safari, which comes with rear-drive or all-wheel drive.\n\nChanges are few for 2001, as they have been in most years, except for a new high-output, 105-amp alternator that can handle laptop computers, cell phones and even a TV at the cargo area for tailgate parties. A new powertrain control module and detonation sensor are supposed to boost engine efficiency. GMC dropped its base-model passenger van this year, leaving the SLE and upscale SLT editions. Cargo vans also are available for commercial use.\n\nExterior\nMarketed in a single size, the Safari rides a 111.2-inch wheelbase and measures 189.8 inches long overall. The Safari and Astro used to fit between the top-selling Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan in size, but things have changed since the 2001 redesigns from Dodge were made. Todays regular-length Caravan is nearly as long as the Safari, while the Grand Caravan measures 11 inches longer. But at just under 75 inches high, the Safari is 6 inches taller than the Caravan.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side, with standard side-hinged, swing-open cargo doors at the rear. Dutch rear doors, which are standard on the passenger-carrying SLT and optional on the SLE, consist of a swing-up rear window on top and twin swing-out half-height doors below. A rear defogger is included only with the Dutch setup.\n\nInterior\nEight-passenger seating is standard in both models. The SLE has a pair of three-passenger benches for rear occupants. In the step-up SLT, rear passengers have split-back bench seats with folding armrests and a center console. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the SLT puts two second-row buckets in place of the bench seat, with a bench at the rear. With second- and third-row seats removed, the Safari offers 170 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nStandard equipment includes a tilt steering wheel and cruise control, along with power windows, door locks and mirrors. Remote keyless entry is a new addition on all 2001 models that come with automatic power door locks. SLT Safaris add aluminum wheels, as well as such convenience features as rear air conditioning and a six-way power drivers seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll Safaris use the same 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A Tow/Haul mode in the transmission promises the best shift points when hauling heavy goods or towing a trailer or boat. Safaris have a payload rating between 1,507 and 1,685 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive ordinarily sends full engine power to the back wheels. In case of wheel slippage, the system automatically begins to deliver power to the front wheels until the Safari is able to regain traction.\n\nAntilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nGMs Astro/Safari duo occupies a distinctive niche in the minivan market. Evaluated by size and the overall driving feel, the Safari and Astro seem closer to being scaled-down Savana or Express vans than to front-drive minivans. Despite refinements and a healthy helping of comfort and convenience features, their rear-wheel- or all-wheel-drive layout inevitably produces more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a front-drive minivan.\n\nFor burly hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Safari serves as a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more at ease in a conventional minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSafari is a twin to the Chevrolet Astro, and both date to 1985. Safari and Astro are available as passenger vans and cargo models and with either standard rear-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive.\n\nGeneral Motors rushed these truck-based vehicles to market 15 years ago in response to Chryslers pace-setting front-wheel-drive minivans. GM later fielded front-drive minivans of its own but kept the Safari and Astro on the roster.\n\nExterior\nSafari comes in a single size, 190 inches long, with a sliding door on the passenger side. A driver-side slider is not available. Two types of rear doors are available. Dual swing-out doors are standard, and unique Dutch doors with a flip-up rear window and swing-out lower doors are optional. The Dutch doors include a defogger for the window. The standard swing-out doors have windows but no defogger.\n\nInterior\nSeats for eight are standard on passenger models, and all but the front bucket seats are removable. The middle and rear seats are three-place benches. Optional seven-passenger seating replaces the middle bench with two bucket seats.\n\nCargo models are limited to two front bucket seats. Maximum cargo volume is 170 cubic feet behind the front buckets.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission are standard across the board. The optional all-wheel-drive system automatically transfers power to the front wheels as needed to maintain traction.\n\nAntilock brakes that operate on all four wheels are standard. Safari has a payload of 1,685 pounds and can tow trailers up to 6,000 pounds.\n\nPerformance\nSafari is a good choice for those who need a beast of burden for hauling and towing, but car-based front-drive minivans are more comfortable, easier to get in and out of, and more economical.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike the similar Chevrolet Astro, the Safari is GMCs long-lived midsize van; it dates back to 1985. The Safari is truck-based and remains available in passenger and cargo-carrying versions with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). Base, SLE and upscale SLT trim levels of the passenger-carrying Safari are available; the SLE and SLT trim designations are actually option groups.\n\nFor 2003, larger standard 16-inch wheels and tires are installed on all models, and aluminum wheels are standard on the SLE and SLT. The braking system has been improved. More affordable entry-level models have also been added. Passenger models seat up to eight occupants and can tow trailers up to 5,400 pounds.\n\nChevrolet also offers the front-wheel-drive (FWD) Venture minivan, but GMC has nothing smaller than the Safari. GMC sells far fewer Safaris than Chevrolet does with its Astro, but GMC fans tend to be loyal to the brand.\n\nExterior\nAll Safaris ride a 111.2-inch wheelbase and stretch 189.8 inches long overall, which are the same measurements for the Astro. A regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long as the Safari, but the Safari is 6 inches taller.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side of the Safari. Side-hinged swing-open cargo doors at the rear are standard. Optional rear Dutch doors consist of a swing-up rear window on top and twin, swing-out, half-height doors on bottom. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door arrangement.\n\nInterior\nEight-passenger seating is standard. Rear occupants get a pair of three-passenger benches in the SLE version. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the SLT puts two second-row buckets (in place of the bench) and a bench seat at the rear. Cargo volume totals 170.4 cubic feet with the second- and third-row seats removed. All versions have a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A Tow/Haul mode in the transmission promises the best shift points when hauling heavy goods or towing a trailer or boat. Safaris have payload ratings between 1,495 and 1,636 pounds, and towing capacities range between 5,100 and 5,800 pounds.\n\nOptional AWD ordinarily sends full engine power to the back wheels. When the wheels begin to slip, the system automatically delivers power to the front wheels until the Safari is able to regain traction.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEvaluated by size and overall driving feel, the Safari and the similar Astro look and behave more like a scaled-down GMC Savana or Chevrolet Express full-size van than like FWD minivans. Despite recent refinements and a healthy helping of comfort and convenience features, their RWD or AWD layouts inevitably produce more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a FWD minivan.\n\nFor burly hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Safari serves as a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more at ease in a conventional, FWD minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/26/03",

      "expert_review": "The GMC Safari is showing age spots. Along                         with the Chevrolet Astro van, Safari was                         GM’s rear-wheel-drive response to Lee                         Iacocca’s front-wheel-drive mini-vans at                      Chrysler in the mid-’80s. \n                          GM insisted van owners wanted                         rear-wheel-drive, truck-tough haulers, not                         front-wheel-drive vans built for show and not                         tow.     \n                          While GM eventually joined in with FWD                         vans, Safari continues for two good reasons,                         both of which were offered on our test                         vehicle: all-wheel-drive for   Snow Belt                         motoring without having to opt for a sport-ute                         or a pickup and a most functional rear                         tri-panel cargo hold/door setup. \n                          Tri-panel means you have a glass hatch                         window that opens separately of two                         swing-out doors below. The window                         provides unobstructed rear vision and allows                         for a wiper/washer/defroster.  The swing-out                         doors allow easy access for loading/                         unloading, and you can leave one open to                         haul that long ladder. \n                          Showing its age, however, Safari has a too-firm ride and too-heavy handling. The                         4.3-liter, 190-h.p. V-6 feels as if it has all it                         can handle. The mileage rating is 15 m.p.g.                         city/19 m.p.g. highway. After six inches of     snow, firm ride, heavy handling and low                         mileage aren’t as annoying in an AWD                         machine. \n                          Base price: $23,316. Options included a                         $4,026 dressup SLE package  with tinted                         glass, dual power mirrors, illuminated visor                         mirrors, overhead console, remote keyless                         entry, luggage rack, swing-out doors,                         AM/FM stereo with      CD/cassette and cast                         aluminum wheels; front/rear air for $523;                         power driver’s seat for $240; rear heater for                         $205; rear-window defogger for $154;                         earphone      radio jacks for $125;                         leather-wrapped wheel for $54; and $595 for                         freight. \n                          GM’s OnStar emergency communications                         system is a new option for 1999.",

      "expert_review": "GMC’s all-wheel-drive Safari minivan may be built on a truck, but it’s outfitted as nicely as a car. That’s a combination some folks prefer.\n\nFrom a functional perspective, it works pretty much the same as other minivans. Once you’re behind the wheel it feels much the same, too, except you sit higher. The interior seemed smaller and tighter than its car-oriented competitors such as the Chevy Venture or Dodge Caravan. Yet, with quad bucket seats, leather upholstery, overhead console and a long list of power equipment, it was plush.\n\nBecause it is tall, getting in requires the Safari two-step: first the running board, then the floor. Front-seat legroom suffers some because the engine sits between the front wheels and intrudes into the footwells.\n\nOur test model had so many options that its $21,902 base price had swollen to $30,560, which is pretty hefty. However, considering that price includes all-wheel-drive, it is priced competitively with the all-wheel-drive Town and Country from Chrysler.\n\nSafaris comes with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is more beneficial for getting around in snow and ice.\n\nBecause the 111-inch wheelbase is shorter than other extended minivans, it can be wheeled into parking spaces easily, and was more maneuverable in tight situations. I pulled a U-turn (don’t tell anyone) with room to spare. Its overall length is 10 inches less than a Dodge Caravan, yet with the second and third row of seats removed it holds fractionally more cargo.\n\nRemoving the seats is not an easy chore. It takes two people to remove the third seat, which is surprisingly heavy and just barely fits through the back doors. The middle buckets were bolted to the floor, so getting them out takes quite an effort. The buckets did slide back and forth so they could be adjusted for legroom, and that was good. However, putting adults in all of the seats would be pretty tight. I would leave the third row of seats for kids.\n\nThe leather upholstery was soft and smooth, and I liked that.\n\nIn spite of a few chunky switches, the instrument panel is well thought out, and everything but the rear wiper switch is easy to grab. Two large cupholders are integrated into the bottom of the dash, as is a storage bin that functions as a glove box because the passenger-side airbag takes up that space.\n\nPower comes from a 4.3-liter, Vortec V6, which has 190 horsepower. With a curb weight of 4,427 pounds, our test vehicle seemed a bit sluggish when I needed more power for merging into traffic or climbing hills.\n\nOnce up to speed, it cruised down the highway pretty comfortably. Even though the wheelbase is fairly short, it did not have a choppy ride. I appreciated the panoramic view from the high seating position, but getting in and out was not easy. Women in skirts would have it even tougher. Every time I slid out of the seat the seat-belt holder gouged my hip and that was annoying.\n\nThe Safari is GMC’s only minivan, and while it is not as space efficient as the Chevy Venture or Pontiac Trans Sport, it fills a niche for those who want rear-wheel or all-wheel drive for towing. Some folks prefer trucks, and it is ideal for them.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $21,902. It was equipped with leather upholstery, front and rear air conditioning, 7-person seating, 6-way power driver’s seat, locking differential, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, tilt wheel, AM/FM stereo with compact disc player and aluminum wheels.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Safari satisfies buyers who like their vans to be based on a truck. It sits high, can tow 5,000 pounds and is available with all-wheel drive.\n\nCounterpoint: The front-engine, rear-drive configuration is not as spacious some of its competitors. Getting in and out is complicated by the tall step-in, and the third seat is a struggle for two people to remove.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.3-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 111 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,427 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $21,902\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $30,560\n\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike the similar Chevrolet Astro, the Safari is GMC’s long-lived midsize van; both date back to 1985. The truck-based Safari remains available in passenger- and cargo-carrying versions and can be equipped with rear- or all-wheel drive. Base, SLE and upscale SLT trim levels of the Safari passenger van are available.\n\nA new standard argent-toned grille on base models was the only modification for 2004, and no changes take place for the 2005 model year.\n\nPassenger vans seat up to eight occupants and can tow trailers weighing as much as 5,400 pounds. Chevrolet has launched a new Uplander minivan for 2005, but GMC doesn’t have a comparable model in its lineup. GMC sells far fewer Safaris than Chevrolet does with its Astro.\n\nExterior\nBoth the Astro and Safari ride a 111.2-inch wheelbase and stretch 189.8 inches long overall. A regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long, but the Safari is 6 inches taller.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side. Side-hinged swing-open rear cargo doors are standard. Optional rear “Dutch doors” consist of a swing-up rear window on the top and twin swing-out half-height doors on the bottom. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door arrangement.\n\nInterior\nEight-passenger seating is standard. Rear occupants get a pair of three-passenger benches in most versions. An available seven-passenger configuration for the SLT features two bucket seats in place of the second-row bench.\n\nCargo volume totals 170.4 cubic feet with the second- and third-row seats removed, and the van offers 41.3 cubic feet behind the upright third-row seat. All passenger versions have a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 produces 250 pounds-feet of torque and mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A tow/haul mode in the transmission promises the best shift points when hauling heavy loads or towing a trailer or boat.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive ordinarily sends full engine power to the back wheels. When the wheels begin to slip, the system automatically delivers power to the front wheels until the Safari is able to regain traction. Heavy-duty trailering equipment is available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEvaluated by size and overall driving feel, the Safari and Astro look and behave more like scaled-down versions of the GMC Savana and Chevrolet Express full-size vans than like front-wheel-drive minivans. Despite recent refinements, their rear- and all-wheel-drive layouts inevitably produce more of a trucklike experience than you’d get in a front-drive minivan.\n\nWith a generous maximum towing capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Safari serves as a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be better suited in a conventional, front-drive minivan.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike the similar Chevrolet Astro, the Safari is GMC’s long-lived midsize van; both date back to 1985. The truck-based Safari remains available in passenger and cargo-carrying versions and with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Base, SLE and upscale SLT trim levels of the passenger-carrying Safari are available; the SLE and SLT trim designations are actually option groups.\n\nLast year, larger 16-inch wheels and tires were installed as standard equipment on all models, and aluminum wheels became standard on the SLE and SLT. More affordable entry-level models were added. A new standard argent-toned grille on base models is the only change for the 2004 model year.\n\nPassenger vans seat up to eight occupants and can tow trailers up to 5,400 pounds. Chevrolet also offers the front-wheel-drive Venture minivan, but GMC does not have a comparable model in its lineup. GMC sells far fewer Safaris than Chevrolet does with its Astro.\n\nExterior\nBoth the Astro and Safari ride a 111.2-inch wheelbase and stretch 189.8 inches long overall. A regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long, but the Safari is 6 inches taller.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side of the Safari. Side-hinged swing-open rear cargo doors are standard. Optional rear Dutch doors consist of a swing-up rear window on the top and twin swing-out half-height doors on the bottom. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door arrangement.\n\nInterior\nEight-passenger seating is standard. Rear occupants get a pair of three-passenger benches in the SLE version. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the SLT features two bucket seats in place of the second-row bench. Cargo volume totals 170.4 cubic feet with the second- and third-row seats removed. All passenger versions have a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A Tow/Haul mode in the transmission promises the best shift points when hauling heavy loads or towing a trailer or boat. Safaris have payload ratings between 1,666 and 1,764 pounds, and towing capacities range between 5,100 and 5,800 pounds.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive ordinarily sends full engine power to the back wheels. When the wheels begin to slip, the system automatically delivers power to the front wheels until the Safari is able to regain traction.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEvaluated by size and overall driving feel, the Safari and Astro look and behave more like scaled-down versions of the GMC Savana and Chevrolet Express full-size vans than like front-drive minivans. Despite recent refinements and a healthy helping of comfort and convenience features, their rear- and all-wheel-drive layouts inevitably produce more of a trucklike experience than you’d get in a front-drive minivan.\n\nWith a burly hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Safari serves as a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be better suited in a conventional front-drive minivan.",
