      "expert_review": "The all-new GMC Acadia is arguably one of the best of the new crossover utility vehicles.\n\nAs these vehicles continue their drive to take over the market segment once controlled by the conventional truck-based SUVs, there haven’t been many midsize models that have stood out.\n\nBut the Acadia, which arrived this past fall as a 2007 model, has received high praise from automotive critics and consumers alike. Dealers are having trouble keeping these vehicles in stock because they are selling so fast. Ditto for the Acadia’s near clones, the 2007 Saturn Outlook, which also went on sale in the fall, and the 2008 Buick Enclave, which went on sale in June.\n\nWhen a Chevrolet version of this platform arrives, perhaps as early as next year, GM will have four varieties of this vehicle.\n\nThese crossovers eventually will replace GM’s entire lineup of truck-based midsize SUVs — the Chevy TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Buick Rainier.\n\nUnlike the TrailBlazer and its siblings, though, these vehicles are car-based, part of the new breed of sport utility that consumers now seem to prefer.\n\nCrossovers sales exceeded those of the truck-based SUVs for the first time last year. As gasoline prices continue to escalate, consumers are moving even faster to these vehicles because of their generally better fuel economy.\n\nHaving the unibody construction of most cars – frame and body are one – saves considerable weight over the body-on-steel-frame configuration of the truck-style SUVs. That’s why they’re more fuel-efficient.\n\nConsumers also seem to prefer the road manners of the crossovers. They ride and handle like cars, and they also have more carlike interior amenities.\n\nEven though many of today’s truck-based SUVs have carlike interiors and amenities, it’s hard to make a truck ride like a car. The casualties of the switch to crossovers are vehicles such as the Ford Explorer, whose sales were down 23 percent in the first half of this year to just 74,704 units. That’s way off the Explorer’s sales pace during most of the ’90s, when more than 500,000 were sold each year.\n\nFuel savings with the crossovers aren’t huge, but they are significant.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive, V-6-powered Acadia, for instance, is EPA rated (2007 formula) at 18 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway vs. 15 city/21 highway for the V-6 Explorer.\n\nOur test vehicle, the all-wheel-drive Acadia, was rated at 17 city/24 highway vs. 15/20 for the Explorer. Over time, these differences in mileage can add up at the pump with gas $3 a gallon.\n\nIn many cases, the crossovers are much more stylish, and the Acadia is among the best-looking.\n\nOur test vehicle was the uplevel Acadia SLT-2 with all-wheel drive, which carries a base price of $37,370 plus $735 freight. With a bunch of options, though, our car’s total sticker climbed quickly to $44,435.\n\nBut a base two-wheel-drive Acadia, which is decently equipped, starts at $29,990 (with freight). It’s not necessary to buy all of the extras to have a nice vehicle.\n\nUnlike the 2007 Ford Edge, another new midsize crossover, the Acadia has seating for up to eight people. Ford limited the Edge to five passengers, although another Ford crossover – the slightly larger Freestyle (which is becoming the Taurus X for 2008) can hold up to seven.\n\nUnder the hood of the Acadia is a new 3.6-liter V-6 engine designed to deliver optimum fuel economy with low emissions and “exceptional smoothness,” the automaker says.\n\nThis engine is rated at 275 horsepower and 251 foot-pounds of torque. That’s either on par with or above the power of the key competitors in this segment, including the Honda Pilot (244 HP), Toyota Highlander (270 HP), and the Edge (265 HP). Most have similar fuel economy, as well.\n\nThe Acadia’s engine is connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, also designed to maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nPower is more than adequate for everyday driving, allowing the Acadia to come quickly to freeway speeds on even uphill ramps. On some rather steep hills, the engine still allowed for acceleration, and the vehicle never seemed to bog down even with a full load of adults and kids.\n\nAs an aficionado of SUVs – I’ve owned vehicles of this sort almost continuously since I bought my first, a Jeep Wagoneer, in the early ’70s – I found the Acadia to be quite stable in hard turns.\n\nSome of the traditional SUVs, with their high profile and resulting high center of gravity, sometimes have felt a bit tipsy. Not so for the Acadia.\n\nThe Acadia has a long wheelbase and wide track, which contribute to the car’s stability and help lessen the possibility of a rollover.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Acadia comes with GM’s Stabilitrak electronic stability control system with traction control and antilock brakes.\n\nThese computerized safety features go a long way toward preventing the vehicle from going out of control in any kind of panic maneuver.\n\nOther safety features include a tire-pressure monitoring system and six standard air bags: two dual-stage frontal air bags, two seat-mounted side-impact air bags in the first row, and roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for all three rows of seating. GM’s OnStar navigation/communications system is standard, including a one-year subscription to the basic “safe and sound” package.\n\nThe more-rugged, truck-based SUVs will remain the choice for those who plan to do serious off-road driving.\n\nCrossovers such as the Acadia are considered “soft-roaders,” which means they have limited off-road capabilities, although they are able to handle many of the dirt roads that might be found in national and state parks.\n\nBesides having lower ground clearance, crossovers aren’t offered with serious four-wheel-drive systems that include low-range gearing.\n\nThe Acadia’s all-wheel drive is intended to give the vehicle increased traction on slippery roads, but it’s also sometimes valuable on dry pavement, particularly during cornering. The system is fully automatic and no driver action is required to activate it.\n\nOutside, the Acadia features GMC’s signature grille, as well as dual halogen projector-beam headlights, a rear spoiler, polished aluminum roof rails, dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips, and bright trim. Standard are 18-inch wheels, but 19-inch wheels are available.\n\nInside is where the Acadia really shines. This vehicle is as carlike and luxurious as many premium sedans, and the extras that were included on our tester made it even fancier than some.\n\nIt can be configured for either seven or eight passengers. The second row can be either a 60/40 split bench, which can hold three, or a pair of captain’s chairs.\n\nThe rear seat can hold three, and GM’s so-called Smart Slide feature on the second row of seats allows for easy access to the third row.\n\nThere is plenty of cargo space behind the third seat – 19.7 cubic feet. In comparison, there is just 13.8 cubic feet of space behind the Explorer’s third seat, and 10.5 cubic feet behind the Toyota Highlander’s. There is a maximum of 117 cubic feet of cargo space if the second and third seats are folded.\n\nStandard on our test vehicle were such amenities as leather seats; heated, power outside mirrors; three-zone heating/air conditioning system; an intermittent rear wiper; ultrasonic rear parking assist; a power rear liftgate; an extended-range remote vehicle-starting system; heated windshield washer fluid; a Bose audio system with six-disc CD changer and XM satellite radio; an eight-way power driver’s and four-way power passenger’s seat; tilt and telescopic, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls; cruise control; a self-dimming rearview mirror; and a 115-volt power outlet.\n\nOptions on our vehicle included a touch-screen navigation system ($2,145); a dual-panel sunroof, which extended over the front and middle rows ($1,300); 19-inch, ultra-bright aluminum wheels ($1,295); a rear DVD entertainment system ($1,295); premium paint ($395); head-up display ($350); and cargo-area audio controls ($150) for tailgate parties.\n\nThe head-up display projects speed and other instrument readouts onto the lower part of the windshield in front of the driver.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2024 GMC Acadia returns to GM’s big crossover-style SUV platform, essentially becoming a fancier, pricier Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nVersus the competition: Segment-best ride quality and a truly classy cabin are offset by a loud, lackluster powertrain that doesn’t match up well with the Acadia’s competitors. The GMC’s off-road chops, however, aren’t too shabby.\n\nIf the 2024 GMC Acadia you’re looking at on this page looks a lot bigger than the outgoing one to you, rest assured your eyesight is just fine. It is bigger, much bigger, because it’s been reengineered to resume its position in the pantheon of GM’s large three-row crossover-style SUVs as the upscale middle child between the mass-market Chevrolet Traverse and the luxurious Buick Enclave, both of which have also been recently redesigned. The new Acadia has switched platforms and now shares its underbits with both of those big “mid-size” SUVs, along with most of their major components like powertrain and suspension. But GMC stylists have given it a look all its own inside and out to make it fit in with the rest of the GMC showroom, and the interior of the new Acadia is a definite step up in quality and materials from the Traverse.\n\nSo, how does it stack up against its GM stablemates, and how does it compare with the huge crop of three-row SUVs now on the market? At GMC’s invitation, we went to Hilton Head, S.C., to drive the ‘24 Acadia on-road and off to find out. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: New, Larger 2024 GMC Acadia Priced From $43,995\n\nA Simplified Lineup\n\nGMC has rethought the trim lineup for the new ‘24 Acadia, paring it down to just three: the base (but not basic) Elevation, the mid-level, off-road-oriented AT4 and the top-spec Denali. Two of those trims were on hand at the vehicle’s media launch in South Carolina, available for driving through the marshy local environments and on smooth asphalt highways. First up was the Denali, which, like the rest of the Denali “sub-brand” at GMC, receives all manner of glitzy chrome embellishments — but for the Acadia Denali in particular, dark chrome is the order of the day; it’s a more subtle look compared with all the flash on Denali pickup trucks. LED lighting is present all around the vehicle, and available 22-inch wheels shod with all-season tires help add a more sophisticated look to the family rig. The Denali badge is bigger than the Acadia badge on the rear tailgate, showing just how much attention and cachet GMC has built with this trim line.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nUnderhood is the exact same turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine as you’ll find in the ‘24 Traverse, making the same 328 horsepower and 326 pounds-feet of torque and mated to the same eight-speed automatic transmission. That GMC couldn’t eke out any more grunt from this engine for the more luxurious and expensive Acadia is kind of disappointing, but it also reflects GM’s view that its customers don’t honestly care what’s under the hood, as long as the vehicle does what’s asked of it.\n\nThe Acadia does, but only just adequately. It doesn’t feel like it has 328 hp due to lazy gas-pedal response, a slow-to-react transmission and an overall powertrain tune that doesn’t really make it feel sprightly or all that quick. It does, however, produce plenty of noise from that engine, with even moderate acceleration sending up a cacophony into the cabin that was reasonably acceptable in a cheaper Traverse but is less so in this more upscale, more expensive Acadia. It sounds like a tractor engine, but it moves the Acadia well enough for most uses. It’s also rated to tow up to 5,000 pounds when equipped with the Trailering Package (standard on the AT4 and Denali).\n\nRolling down the mostly smooth pavement around Hilton Head, the Acadia Denali was supremely comfortable. The ride quality is what most stands out about the new SUV — it is utterly undisturbed by any road imperfections despite the big 22-inch wheels and tires. There’s no floatiness, no bouncy body motions, just beautifully damped cruising. I wish the steering was as well tuned, however, as the Acadia exhibits the same on-center vagueness and flightiness as its Chevy cousin. It feels like the wheel is always being pulled in some direction or another, or that the electronic lane departure steering assist that I deactivated wasn’t actually fully deactivated. It makes for tiresome straight-line cruising, especially at higher speeds, as you find that the Acadia is always requiring corrective input. It’s not annoying enough to sink the Acadia in recommendations, but if not for the Acadia’s sublime ride quality and body control, it’d be a different story.\n\nGM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system also makes its debut on the Acadia for 2024, and it’s available on all trim levels. It works as well here as it does in any of the applications in which I’ve tried it, but it has also been recently expanded to include places like rural two-lane highways, which feature things like oncoming traffic, intersections, driveways and other things that make me absolutely not want to use even cruise control, much less take my hands off the steering wheel. The system does work in these environments, but only periodically, and it’s not a relaxing experience. Out on the highway, however, when all traffic is proceeding in the same direction and there’s a much more controlled flow, it’s a much better story. That’s the only place I’d ever recommend using the system.\n\nDelightful Denali Digs\n\nSo the driving experience doesn’t really set the Acadia apart from the Traverse … like, at all. However, the cabin environment certainly does, especially in the top-trim Denali. It’s a totally different look in here than you’ll find in the Chevy, with a blockier, more geometric bent to the styling that fits in well with vehicles like the new GMC Hummer EV SUV. There’s a bright digital gauge cluster that positively shames the one in the Toyota Grand Highlander with its reconfigurability, easy readability and overall sophistication. But the bigger news is the main dashboard screen, a 15-inch touchscreen that feels like it’s in Instagram photo format. Whereas the Traverse has a 17.7-inch horizontally oriented touchscreen, this more portrait layout is actually quite nice (and one of the few portrait-style screens we can say that about). There’s a good mix of hard buttons, toggles and touchscreen controls for everything from climate control to various ancillary systems, and all of it works quite well — except for the panel of switches to the left side of the dash, where your drive mode selector is right next to the electronic parking brake, and neither is easily visible while driving. The rest of the system works great until you get into a cellular-data dead zone (as we did once or twice).\n\nSee, the new system uses Google Built-In technology and makes heavy use of cloud computing for everything, including the car’s voice commands. Asking the navigation system to “pause navigation” for a moment while we tried to speak to a colleague in the car didn’t work, as it couldn’t connect to the outside world. Such is the problem with these new Google-based systems, and it’s not a problem that’s unique to GM: A data connection is required in order to make full use of your car’s embedded systems and voice commands.\n\nThe rest of the Acadia Denali interior is absolutely lovely. Real wood lines the dash and doors, the leather quality is excellent, the stitching is straight and true, and the color selections follow the familiar Denali aesthetic. It feels like an upscale environment, easily as good as our benchmark Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy that won our 2024 3-Row SUV Challenge earlier in the year. It’s quite comfortable, too, with excellent space in the first two rows, including plenty of head- and legroom. Third-row space is decent but not huge — full-sized adults will fit, but they won’t want to be back there for terribly long. Your kids will be happier there, and you’ll be fine with putting them there, as access to the third row is easy thanks to standard folding second-row captain’s chairs. Cargo room is obviously much better in the ‘24 Acadia than in the ‘23 due to the switch to GM’s big mid-size SUV platform. If you’re coming out of a ‘23 and looking for a ‘24, the size improvement will almost certainly make you happy.\n\nOver the River and Through the Woods\n\nGMC’s AT4 trim has been something of a mixed bag depending on which vehicle wears it. In the pickup trucks, it’s an excellent off-road package, bringing a host of parts, tires, wheels, suspension mods, factory lifts and more. But in the GMC SUVs, it’s been little more than an appearance package, with the last Acadia AT4 not getting much more than slightly more aggressive tires and special trim. For ‘24, however, the Acadia AT4 gets the same changes as the Traverse Z71, which means a bunch of upgrades to make it work much better in the dirt and that amount to much more than just an appearance package.\n\nFrom the front, the Acadia AT4 has a different lower bumper with an integrated aluminum skid plate, functional red tow hooks that you can see and a steel underbody skid plate that you can’t. The big 20-inch standard Acadia wheels are replaced with unique 18-inch wheels with much knobbier all-terrain off-road tires. Mechanically, the AT4 gets a 1-inch lift, a retuned off-road suspension and even a different all-wheel-drive system meant more for off-road work. Inside, there’s a new Terrain mode in the digital drive mode selector, which works more as a rock-crawling mode, while Off-Road mode allows for higher-speed maneuvers — helpful for maintaining engine revs and forward momentum while traversing things like sandy trails.\n\nThe AT4 drives a little differently than the Denali, but not much. It’s a little louder inside due to the knobbier off-road tires, and the handling isn’t quite as sharp, but the ride quality is just as good thanks to the taller-sidewall tires and excellent tune of the shocks and springs. The most amazing thing is that the ride quality is good on- or off-road, with the ability to barrel down dirt and gravel forest roads at 40-50 mph over washboard terrain with no negative impact to the cabin at all. A little shake comes through the steering wheel, but it’s nothing like what you’d experience in even an off-road pickup (Ford F-150 Raptors excepted). Off-Road mode allows you to really gun it through deep sand, sliding all over the place, while Terrain mode is useful for climbing minor obstacles. This is not, however, a highly capable off-road SUV — it’s meant more for periodic trips to a rural cabin or for really poor weather on unprepared dirt roads than scaling the Rubicon Trail. It basically does off-road what I generally expect all SUVs should be able to do, regardless of whether they’re car- or truck-based underneath. But the AT4 does it with aplomb and comfort, something not all SUVs achieve.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 GMC Acadia Up Close: Bigger and Better\nRedesigned 2024 GMC Acadia Gets Upsized Dimensions, Lone Four-Cylinder Engine\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2024?\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nShop for a 2024 GMC Acadia\nPricing and Features\n\nWith the bump in size for the 2024 model year comes a bump in price for the Acadia, as well, which is to be expected — it did get cheaper when it went to a smaller platform, so it makes sense it’d get pricier with the size increase. The base front-wheel-drive Elevation trim level starts at $43,995 (all prices include a $1,395 destination charge), but it comes well equipped with 20-inch aluminum wheels, a hands-free power liftgate, keyless entry, remote start, faux leather upholstery, power heated front seats, three-zone automatic climate control, the aforementioned digital screens and a 12-speaker Bose stereo. Bump up to the AT4, which is only offered with AWD, and you’re starting at $51,395, but it does include unique interior appointments of cloth-and-vinyl seats with embroidered head restraints, different colors and all of that off-road AT4 equipment. The top Denali starts at $55,695, and it includes a lot of luxury content like heated and ventilated front seats, one-touch folding second-row captain’s chairs, a power-folding third row, rain-sensing wipers, a head-up display and more. You can option a Denali even higher, but where it starts is pretty much where a lot of competitors tend to top out.\n\nOverall, the new 2024 Acadia is a solid and highly competitive entry in the big three-row family SUV class. It provides a value model that’s still quite upscale and well equipped, a luxury model that has all of the bells and whistles, and an off-road-oriented model that won’t penalize you on pavement and genuinely brings some capability with it. It’s a nice upgrade from the Traverse’s rather plasticky cabin and provides buyers with an aspirational option for when they’re ready for something a little nicer looking and feeling inside and out.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the GMC Acadia a Good SUV?\n\nThe large and well-equipped 2025 GMC Acadia Denali could be an unexpected alternative to the bigger, more expensive GMC Yukon, and it’s certainly one of the most compelling entries in the ultra-popular mid-size three-row SUV class.\n\nHow Does the GMC Acadia Compare With Other SUVs?\n\nThe 2025 GMC Acadia is larger than most of its segment-mates, like the Kia Telluride, Honda Pilot and Toyota Grand Highlander, genuinely splitting the difference between the mid- and full-size SUV classes, but with towing capability and performance that matches the mid-sizers.\nDo You Need a GMC Yukon? Or a Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe question isn’t whether you want a GMC Yukon or not, but do you need one? Think and answer again: Do you need a GMC Yukon?\n\nChances are good that, if you truly reflect upon your heart of hearts, the answer is no; I’d bet the majority of folks who buy these behemoths can boil their reasoning down to “I just like a big ol’ SUV.” And that’s a perfectly fine line of reasoning, but have you seen the GMC Acadia recently? It’s huge. Like, huge-huge. And the Acadia Denali, which is the car I test-drove for this review, is properly luxe — as all the best GMC Denalis are.\n\nRelated: 2025 GMC Acadia Comes With More Seats Standard, Priced From $44,295\n\nWhat’s the Price Difference Between a GMC Acadia and Yukon?\n\nI’m a zealous fan of GM’s full-size SUVs — they’re still my first-round draft pick for best road-trip vehicle — but I reckon some people would be genuinely better served by downsizing just a bit.\n\nLet’s start with price: A top-trim Acadia Denali with all-wheel drive starts at $57,495, including destination fee, compared with the $72,195 that a base four-wheel-drive Yukon will cost you. And a four-wheel-drive Yukon Denali? That’ll be roughly $10,000 more.\n\nThe Acadia Denali has left little on the cutting floor. Its seats and interior surfaces are done up in perforated leather, with the front seats incorporating heating and ventilation functions. The steering wheel is also heated, as are the second-row seats, and that’s all complimented by tri-zone automatic climate control. All the expected “premium” finery is here, including a head-up display, a massive 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system, acoustic glass, wood trim, beaucoup charging ports and a primo Bose sound system. In terms of its raw feature set, it slightly outperforms the base Yukon.\n\nWhat’s the EPA Fuel Economy of the GMC Acadia?\n\nChoosing an Acadia over a Yukon also means you’ll visit the gas pump less often: An AWD Acadia with the turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is good for an EPA-rated 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, versus the Yukon’s EPA-estimated 15/19/17 mpg rating with its 5.3-liter V-8 and 4WD. The Yukon does, however, offer a turbo-diesel six-cylinder that’s rated as high as an impressive 23 mpg combined.\n\nOver 464 miles of mixed city and long-distance highway driving in the Acadia, I averaged a trip-computer-reported 18.6 mpg — a figure that’s significantly higher than I’ve experienced in a full-size GM SUV in similar driving.\n\nThe full-size body-on-frame Yukon does have its distinct advantages, naturally. No matter which way you fold it, the big Yuke handily out-tows the Acadia, with a maximum capacity of 8,400 pounds versus the Acadia’s competitive-for-its-segment 5,000-pound towing capacity. Passengers will generally be more comfortable in the bigger bus; the Yukon offers significantly more shoulder and hip room. Surprisingly, differences in the Acadia’s and Yukon’s headroom and legroom are modest until you get to the third row, where passengers will be far happier with the Yukon’s legroom. And, predictably, you can cram more crap in the Yuke, which has an additional 25 cubic feet of cargo room, by GM’s measurements, with both rear rows of seats folded.\n\n2025 GMC Acadia Denali | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 GMC Acadia?\n2024 GMC Acadia Review: Distinctive Looks, Common Personality\nRedesigned 2024 GMC Acadia Gets Upsized Dimensions, Lone Four-Cylinder Engine\n2024 GMC Acadia Up Close: Bigger and Better\nShop for a 2025 GMC Acadia Near You\nHow Does the GMC Acadia Drive?\n\nWhile the Acadia Denali offers a more premium space than the base Yukon, it doesn’t deliver a superior driving experience. The Acadia’s turbo four-cylinder is plenty gutsy, with 328 horsepower and 326 pounds-feet of torque, but it can feel as though it’s straining a bit against the SUV’s bulk. Merging is still a confident, worry-free affair, but there’s significantly more gnash ‘n thrash from the powertrain than you’ll experience from any of the Yukon’s three available engines.\n\nIn every other scenario, the Acadia was every bit the cozy, cush, long-legged shuttle I expected it to be. GM’s excellent Super Cruise hands-free driving system was fabulous on my drive between Los Angeles and Palm Springs, Calif.; it’s a $3,490 option I’d beeline for if I were speccing my own Acadia Denali. I can’t, however, say the same of the $3,130 Denali Reserve Package, which includes a “performance suspension” and larger 22-inch wheels and tires. It was perfectly buttery, I’d just need a back-to-back comparison with an Acadia Denali without that kit to determine if the added “passive, frequency-based dampers” are worth the extra spend.\n\nNeed, need, need — that’s the theme here. Before you order that lovely Yukon, go see and sit in a new Acadia — you might learn something about yourself and save a chunk of cash.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Crossover utility vehicles have fared much better than traditional SUVs over the past few months as gasoline prices spiked to record highs.\n\nWhile sales of some, including the popular Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot, have been weaker than normal, some of the newer crossovers have resonated well with consumers in spite of $4-a-gallon gas.\n\nAmong those is the GMC Acadia, which arrived for 2007 and has become one of the best-selling family haulers during these tough days in the auto market.\n\nAlthough it competes against the midsize Highlander and Pilot, the Acadia is better described as a large crossover, and it’s one of only three of this size offered for model year 2008. The other two, not surprisingly, are variations of the Acadia – the Saturn Outlook and Buick Enclave.\n\nYet another version arrives in October – the 2009 Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nThe Acadia has received high praise from automotive critics and consumers alike. As have its siblings. The Traverse, which will be assembled all by itself at the former Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., should find the same kind of positive reception.\n\nThese crossovers eventually will replace GM’s truck-based midsize SUVs – the Chevy TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy (already gone is the Buick Rainier, a sibling to the TrailBlazer/Envoy).\n\nWhat’s driving sales of the crossovers, besides the fact that consumers have grown tired of the truck-style SUVs, is that they have generally better fuel economy and they offer more-refined rides and handling.\n\nUsing the unibody construction of cars – frame and body are one – saves considerable weight over the body-on-frame configuration of the traditional SUVs, which is the main reason the crossovers are more fuel-efficient.\n\nAlthough many of the newer SUVs have carlike amenities, it’s hard to make a truck ride like a car. The casualties of the switch to crossovers are vehicles such as the Ford Explorer, once the best-selling passenger vehicle on the market.\n\nOur tester, the front-wheel-drive, V-6-powered Acadia, is EPA rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway. An Acadia with the optional all-wheel drive is rated at 16 city/22. The V-6 Explorer, in comparison, is rated at 14/20 with two-wheel drive, and 13/19 with four-wheel drive.\n\nAnother plus for the crossovers is that they’re generally more stylish than vehicles such as the Explorer, and the Acadia is among the best-looking.\n\nBase prices of the 2008 Acadia range from just under $30,140 to $38,665 (plus $735 freight). For 2009, the prices are slightly higher — $30,950-$39,600. The freight charge remains the same.\n\nWe tested the uplevel 2008 Acadia SLT-2 with front-wheel drive, which carries a base price of $36,650 plus freight. With options, our car’s total sticker was $43,740.\n\nBut a base two-wheel-drive Acadia is decently equipped, so it’s really not necessary to buy all of the extras to have a nice vehicle.\n\nUnder the hood is a 3.6-liter V-6 engine rated at 275 horsepower and 251 foot-pounds of torque. That’s either on par with or above the power of the key competitors in this segment, including the Pilot and Highlander. Most of the competitors have similar fuel economy, as well.\n\nThe Acadia’s engine is connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, also designed to maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nPower is more than adequate for everyday driving, allowing the Acadia to come quickly to freeway speeds on even uphill ramps. On some rather steep hills, the engine still allowed for acceleration, and the vehicle never seemed to bog down even with a full load of adults and kids.\n\nThe Acadia has a long wheelbase and wide track, which contribute to the car’s stability and help lessen the possibility of a rollover. They also give it the roomy interior, which can accommodate up to eight people comfortably.\n\nAll Acadias come with GM’s electronic stability control system with traction control and antilock brakes. These computerized safety features go a long way toward preventing the vehicle from going out of control in any kind of panic maneuver.\n\nOther safety features include a tire-pressure monitoring system and six standard air bags: two dual-stage frontal air bags, two seat-mounted side-impact air bags in the first row, and roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for all three rows of seating. GM’s OnStar navigation/communications system is standard, including a one-year subscription to the basic “safe and sound” package.\n\nThe more-rugged, truck-based SUVs will remain the choice for those who plan to do serious off-road driving.\n\nCrossovers such as the Acadia have limited off-road capabilities, although they are able to handle many of the dirt roads that might be found in national and state parks. Besides having generally lower ground clearance, crossovers aren’t offered with serious four-wheel-drive systems that include low-range gearing.\n\nThe Acadia’s all-wheel drive is intended to give the vehicle increased traction on slippery roads, but it’s also sometimes valuable on dry pavement, particularly during cornering. The system is fully automatic and no driver action is required to activate it.\n\nExterior features include GMC’s signature grille, as well as dual halogen projector-beam headlights, a rear spoiler, polished aluminum roof rails, dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips, and bright trim. Standard are 18-inch wheels, but 19-inch wheels are available.\n\nInside, the Acadia really shines. This vehicle is as luxurious as many premium sedans. It can be configured for either seven or eight passengers. The second row can be either a 60/40 split bench, which can hold three, or a pair of captain’s chairs.\n\nThe rear seat can hold three, and GM’s so-called Smart Slide feature on the second row of seats allows for easy access to the third row. We put three adults in the rear, and they didn’t complain.\n\nAnother bonus: Even with the third seat in place, there is plenty of cargo space behind it – 19.7 cubic feet. In comparison, there is just 13.8 cubic feet of space behind the Explorer’s third seat, and 10.5 cubic feet behind the Highlander’s. The Acadia has a maximum of 117 cubic feet of cargo space if the second and third seats are folded.\n\nStandard on our test vehicle were such amenities as leather seats; heated, power outside mirrors; three-zone heating/air conditioning system; an intermittent rear wiper; ultrasonic rear parking assist; a power rear liftgate; an extended-range remote vehicle-starting system; heated windshield washer fluid; a Bose audio system with six-disc CD changer and XM satellite radio; an eight-way power driver’s and four-way power passenger’s seat; tilt and telescopic, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls; cruise control; a self-dimming rearview mirror; and a 115-volt power outlet.\n\nOptions on our vehicle included a touch-screen navigation system ($2,340); a dual-panel sunroof, which extended over the front and middle rows ($1,300); 19-inch alloy wheels ($995); a rear DVD entertainment system ($1,295); and a towing package ($350).\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995. Contact him at, 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\nAt a Glance: 2008 GMC Acadia The package: Midsize, four-door, seven- or eight-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive crossover utility vehicle.\n\nHighlights: This is one of four GM midsize crossovers built on the same architecture. The others are the Saturn Outlook, Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse (coming in October). They are quite refined, have lots of power yet decent fuel economy, and come with a variety of standard and optional features.\n\nDisadvantages: No serious four-wheel-drive system offered for off-road use.\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter V-6.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nPower/torque: 275 HP/251 foot-pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted; side-curtain, all three rows, standard.\n\nLength: 201.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight range: 4,720-4,925 pounds.\n\nCargo volume: 19.7 cubic feet (behind third seat); 68.9 cubic feet (third row folded).\n\nTrailer-towing capacity: 4,500 pounds.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 22 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 city/24 highway (2WD); 16/22 (AWD).\n\nMajor competitors: Honda Pilot, 2009 Ford Flex, Ford Taurus X, Toyota Highlander, Acura MDX.\n\nBase price range: $30,140 to $38,665 plus $735 freight (2008); $30,950-$39,600 (2009 models, plus $735 freight).\n\nPrice as tested: $43,740, including freight and options (2008 SLT-2 model with two-wheel drive).\n\nOn the Road rating: 9.3 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Acadia is GMC’s first crossover and is part of a growing family of large crossover vehicles at General Motors. To distinguish itself from its kin (i.e. Buick Enclave/Chevy Traverse/Saturn Outlook), the Acadia shares design cues with GMC’s full-size SUVs, the Yukon and Yukon XL. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, the Acadia can seat seven or eight. The Acadia competes with the likes of the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe 2009 GMC Acadia gets an updated 288-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 with direct-injection technology.\n\nExterior\nThe Acadia is the boxiest of GM’s full-size crossover quartet. The roofline is tapered, with a standard spoiler at the rear.\n\nThe Acadia also features wide rear doors and a low step-in height. Measuring in at 201.1 inches long and 78.9 inches wide, this crossover is larger than all its competitors — in fact, it’s about as large as the GMC Yukon.\n\nStandard LED taillights\nPolished aluminum roof rails\nDual exhaust outlets with chrome tips\nEighteen-inch cast-aluminum wheels\nAvailable 19-inch machined aluminum wheels\nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nOptional two-panel power sunroof with tilt-sliding front and fixed rear, plus a power sunscreen\n\nInterior\nThe Acadia features a two-tone interior with metal-finished trim accents on the vents, door handles and cupholders. With two captain’s chairs in the second row, maximum seating capacity is seven, but with a 60/40-split bench there’s room for eight. The second- and third-row seats fold flat, and items can be stored beneath the rear cargo floor. The second row slides forward to increase legroom for third-row passengers and makes it easier to get to the third row.\n\nThere is 154.4 cubic feet of passenger space in the three rows, and with the second- and third-row seats folded, there is 116.9 cubic feet of cargo space; cargo space shrinks to about 24 cubic feet with all seats up. This eclipses the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9. The Acadia even has more cargo volume with the seats down than a Yukon.\n\nStandard remote keyless entry and cruise control\nOptional leather seats\nOptional ultrasonic parking assist and rearview camera\nOptional DVD-based navigation system\nOptional heated and cooled seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll Acadias come standard with a 288-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 270 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The 5 percent increase in horsepower over last year’s model is due to the addition of direct-injection technology that improves power and reduces cold-start emissions by up to 25 percent.\n\nPower steering with variable effort reduces power assist at speed\nAvailable intelligent all-wheel drive manages the torque split between the front and rear axles, putting more power to different axles as needed\nLinked ‘H’ rear suspension design reduces noise and vibration in the cabin\n\nSafety\nThe Acadia includes many common safety features and a few rarities for this price range. Side curtain airbags are designed to preemptively engage if there is imminent threat of a rollover and stay inflated longer during a rollover.\n\nTwo dual-stage front airbags, two front-seat side-thorax airbags and two side curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system and traction control\nFour-disc antilock braking system\nPanic Brake Assist, a supplemental emergency braking system\nOnStar comes standard, including one free year of Safe and Sound service, which alerts authorities in the event of a collision",

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for the 2024 model year on a larger three-row platform, the GMC Acadia rolls into 2026 with a new range-topping trim level but is otherwise little changed. The new Denali Ultimate trim caps the lineup with upgraded interior and exterior bits, plus every luxury and tech feature in GMC’s arsenal. Meanwhile, the rest of the Acadia lineup gets only a standard rearview mirror camera to distinguish the 2026 SUV from the 2025. The 2026 GMC Acadia starts at $45,595 (all prices include $1,895 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2026 GMC Acadia Gets New Denali Ultimate Trim\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nMost versions of the 2026 GMC Acadia are on sale now; the Denali Ultimate will arrive in showrooms later in the fall.

Inside, it boasts synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and tri-zone automatic climate control. Cabin tech consists of an 11-inch digital instrument panel, 15-inch infotainment touchscreen, wireless phone charging, 12-speaker Bose sound system and active noise cancellation.\n\nThe Acadia AT4 is only available with AWD and rides on a suspension modified for off-road exploring. It, too, rides on 18-inch wheels, but here they wear all-terrain tires. A unique grille, red tow hooks and an underbody skid plate distinguish the AT4. It also features black exterior trim, hill descent control, a power-adjustable passenger seat and unique upholstery in a blend of synthetic leather and cloth.\n\nPreviously the pinnacle of the Acadia lineup, the Denali features 20-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, body-color fender flares and rain-sensing windshield wipers with de-icers. Its cabin gains heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard second-row seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering column (a manually adjustable piece is standard in the Elevation and AT4), a head-up display and perforated leather upholstery.\n\nThe new-for-2026 Denali Ultimate gets 22-inch wheels, LED daytime running lights, a panoramic moonroof, exclusive Woodland Mahogany (brown) leather upholstery with contrast stitching, massaging front seats, Paldao wood trim and a 16-speaker Bose audio system.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe 2026 GMC Acadia boasts a lengthy list of safety technologies. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, blind spot intervention, front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, a 360-degree camera system, rear parking sensors, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nA package with Super Cruise hands-free semi-autonomous highway driving is optional on the Elevation, AT4 and Denali; it’s standard on the Denali Ultimate. The package also includes automated parking and a driver-attention monitor.\n\nRead More About the GMC Acadia:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 GMC Acadia?\n2025 GMC Acadia Review: Do You Really Need a Yukon?\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nIs the 2025 GMC Acadia a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEvery 2026 Acadia is powered by a 328-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine good for 326 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.

Front- and all-wheel-drive can be had with either engine.

Each offers a third row, but the cushions in both those rows are low, and space is limited for adults. The Acadia has a USB port in the third row, which the Pilot lacks. The Acadia’s multimedia system is easier to use than the Pilot’s, but the Honda has more interior storage space.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 GMC Acadia?\n\nIf you’ve got a big family with a lot of devices to keep charged on long trips, and you’re looking for an SUV to deliver a quiet, comfortable driving experience, the Acadia could be a good choice for you. If your family has a lot of stuff to lug around on a daily basis, though, the Acadia’s limited cargo space behind the third row could be an issue.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned Acadia is thoroughly unremarkable, from its styling to its manners, and not even a weak attempt at an off-road trim level has changed that.\n\nVersus the competition: If you’re looking for a real off-road-capable mid-size SUV, look elsewhere, such as a Toyota 4Runner or Jeep Grand Cherokee; the AT4 upgrades to the Acadia are mostly cosmetic, not functional.\n\nThe GMC Acadia receives a refresh for 2020, with new front and rear styling, a lightly revised interior and a new optional engine (in certain trim levels). But the biggest news is the arrival of a new trim level, one that GMC uses on its other trucks to denote a special off-road version: AT4.\n\nAT4 has become a “sub-brand” for GMC; much like the Denali name denotes its luxury trucks, AT4 is meant to indicate GMC’s truckiest trucks. On the Sierra 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickups, the designation brings with it a bunch of off-road goodies — like skid plates, special suspension pieces, chunky all-terrain tires on special wheels, and a blacked-out look for its chrome bits and interior pieces. When GMC announced the car-based Acadia crossover was going to get the same treatment, we were excited. Maybe GMC would deliver a legit off-roader to compete with the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk and Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro. Alas, no.\n\nThe Acadia AT4 gets no more capability than a standard all-wheel-drive Acadia aside from chunkier all-terrain tires, a dual-clutch all-wheel-drive system (shared with the Chevrolet Blazer’s top trim levels) and Hill Descent Control. Beyond that, it’s a bog-standard V-6 Acadia. So is it any good?\n\nLooks the Part\n\nThe Acadia’s styling changes are positive ones. The new model looks chunkier, more imposing and more dramatic than the outgoing model. It fits in better with the rest of GMC’s freshened lineup thanks to the larger, more rectangular family grille. The AT4 treatment does bring some bling to the Acadia – or, more accurately, it takes some bling away and replaces it with blacked-out trim. The grille and trim get blacked-out chrome, while unique wheels in either 17-inch or optional 20-inch sizes are shod with Continental all-terrain tires. My test vehicle came with the standard 17-inch tires, which are ostensibly better for off-roading thanks to their taller sidewalls’ ability to soak up bumps. Frankly, they also look better than the big 20-inch machined wheels; the smaller wheels’ blacked-out look just works better with the black plastic lower body cladding and blacked-out trim on my test vehicle, giving it a truly murdered-out look.\n\nBut Doesn’t Deliver\n\nSadly, the AT4 changes are mostly skin-deep. The only engine available is a 3.6-liter V-6 making 310 horsepower and 271 pounds-feet of torque, which is the premium engine in the Acadia (it’s also standard on the Denali). The standard powertrain on a base Acadia SL (the rental counter special) and SLE is a 193-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder, while SLT trims come with a 230-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Both the SLE and SLT can have the V-6, as well. All engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission, and front-wheel drive is standard on all trims except the AT4.\n\nWe’re used to the AT4’s 3.6-liter engine; General Motors uses it in so many of its models we just expect it whenever the 2.0-liter turbo isn’t present. It’s adequate to power the Acadia, but only just. The nine-speed transmission’s behavior is geared more toward preserving fuel economy than providing entertaining acceleration, with slow, lazy shifts that happen early in the rev range. Fuel economy results prove it out: The Acadia V-6 with all-wheel drive is rated 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week with the vehicle returned an overall average of 22 mpg. That puts it near the bottom of the pack in our latest roundup of three-row mid-size SUVs, above the bigger, V-6-powered Volkswagen Atlas but below the smaller turbocharged four-cylinder Subaru Ascent.\n\nThe Acadia will move if you really put your foot down, but it’ll be accompanied by surprising amounts of torque steer in two-wheel-drive mode. All-wheel drive can be deactivated using a rotary Drive Mode Selector knob, supposedly to improve fuel economy by not employing unnecessary drivetrain bits when the roads are dry and clear. The same knob can also engage various drive modes, including a Sport mode, but none of them noticeably change the way the Acadia behaves on the road.\n\nThe Acadia AT4’s other driving attributes are a mixed bag. The ride is smooth and compliant, thanks in no small part to my test vehicle’s 17-inch wheels and tall-sidewall tires. Surprisingly, they didn’t diminish the crossover’s steering or handling; steering response is admirably direct, and the feel is decent, as well. The brakes are uninspiring, with considerable softness on initial application. Stay on them hard, however, and they will bring the Acadia down from highway speeds with minimal effort. The Acadia has none of the firm, entertaining sportiness of a new Ford Explorer, and none of the upscale chassis refinement of a Kia Telluride. You won’t mistake this for anything other than the crossover equivalent of the average family sedan. It’s a thoroughly ordinary driving experience — one meant not to offend or exhilarate, just to be stable, confident and reliable for family transport.\n\nWhat it’s not is more off-road capable in any meaningful way than other Acadias, and it falls well short of the abilities of off-road-oriented SUVs like the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, Toyota 4Runner or even a Subaru Outback. There’s no additional ride height, no special shock absorbers or springs, no additional underbody protection, no tow hooks — nothing you get in the AT4 package on GMC’s pickups and upcoming full-size SUVs, aside from some chunkier standard tires. The Acadia AT4 does get GM’s dual-clutch AWD system, which also appears on the Chevrolet Blazer, but its benefit in off-road situations is unclear. (The Blazer is solely street-focused.) Hill Descent Control, for whatever it’s worth, is also exclusive to this trim level, accompanying the Drive Mode Selector that includes an Off-Road mode in all-wheel-drive Acadias. GMC opted to make the AT4 little more than an appearance package on this model, which is disappointing given how capable and noteworthy it is on other GMC offerings.\n\nInterior Typical for GM These Days\n\nThere are a few updates to the interior, but they don’t go very far toward improving the overall quality feel of the 2020 Acadia’s cabin. The center console is new, and the shifter has been converted into the pushbutton style that first appeared on the GMC Terrain (an adaptation of which now appears on the redesigned full-size 2021 Yukon). There’s a revised multimedia system, as well, which works better than before (not that I had any real complaints about GM’s multimedia systems, which are better than average). It’s displayed on a standard 8-inch touchscreen.\n\nFront- and second-row seats are comfortable, spacious and multi-adjustable. The second-row captain’s chairs slide forward and backward, allowing passengers to adjust legroom among themselves. The third row is not comfortable and is suitable only for children. Getting into and out of it is a challenge, and there isn’t a lot of width or headroom once you’re there. This underscores the Acadia’s position in the middle of the “mid-size crossover” segment, comparable more to the Subaru Ascent and Honda Pilot than the bigger boys like the Kia Telluride, VW Atlas, Hyundai Palisade and Chevrolet Traverse — of which the Acadia was a twin until GMC downsized it for the 2017 model year.\n\nThe issue with the Acadia’s interior is that it falls short of competitors in terms of design, equipment and materials quality. At this price — nearly $47,000 as-tested — there are no memory seats and the multimedia screen is too small (8 inches isn’t what it used to be). The moonroof shade is a thin, cheap fabric that flaps around alarmingly in its track when the windows are open and the shade is closed. There’s hard plastic on the touch points around your knees, a general lack of warmth throughout the interior and a whole lot of charcoal gray plastic that looks and feels cheap. The price tag feels wholly inappropriate when you compare this vehicle with a new Kia Telluride or Hyundai Palisade — the new benchmarks in this class — but it also falls short of the equipment specs for a VW Atlas.\n\nRoom Enough for Stuff\n\nKeep the third row stowed, and the Acadia AT4 has enough room to swallow a good amount of stuff. There’s only 12.8 cubic feet of room behind the third row, but 41.7 cubic feet when it’s folded and 79.0 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded, Chevrolet says. We unfortunately weren’t able to do a full workup on the Acadia ourselves, but our own measurements of other vehicle cargo areas have shown a great discrepancy between how various automakers report their numbers, so a meaningful comparison to other competitors is difficult. The biggest three-row SUV cargo area we’ve measured ourselves was the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse, where we measured 15.2 cubic feet behind the third row and just 28.6 cubic feet behind the second row (with the third row folded). Given the Traverse has an unquestionably larger cargo area than the Acadia, that doesn’t jibe with the 41.7 cubic feet GMC reports for the Acadia’s cargo area, so you see how screwy cargo volume reporting can be. Suffice to say there’s plenty of room with the third row folded, and with the second row folded the Acadia is spacious enough for most families.\n\nSafety, for a Price\n\nThe Acadia received a big redesign back in 2017, and the new model has gotten top marks for crash safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t yet posted the 2020’s rating, but it gave the 2019 version five stars overall, and there haven’t been any structural changes that would affect its 2020 score.\n\nThe newest Acadia can be had with a full complement of electronic safety equipment, but many of the more advanced features that are beginning to come standard on competing models remain optional on high trim levels of GM vehicles. The AT4 comes standard with rear park assist sensors with cross-traffic alert, lane change alert with blind spot warning, and an HD backup camera. But features like automatic high beams, front parking sensors, forward collision alert, lane keep assist, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking are in an option package. Many of these items are standard on competitors from Hyundai, Kia, Subaru and Ford.\n\nThat Price is Tough to Swallow\n\nThe 2020 Acadia starts at a low $30,995 including destination for a front-wheel-drive SL with the standard 2.5-liter engine, but good luck finding one of those. Far more numerous will be mid-level trims like the SLE and SLT. The AT4 starts at $43,395 and includes the V-6 engine and standard all-wheel drive.\n\n \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Acadia is GMC’s first crossover, and it’s part of a growing family of large crossover vehicles at General Motors. To distinguish itself from its kin (the Buick Enclave and Chevy Traverse), the Acadia shares design cues with GMC’s full-size SUVs, the Yukon and Yukon XL. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, the Acadia can seat seven or eight. The Acadia competes with the likes of the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no major changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nThe Acadia is the boxiest of GM’s full-size crossovers. The roofline is tapered, with a standard spoiler at the rear.\n\nThe Acadia also features wide rear doors and a low step-in height. It measures 200.7 inches long and 78.2 inches wide.\n\nStandard LED taillights\nPolished aluminum roof rails\nDual exhaust outlets with chrome tips\n18-inch cast-aluminum wheels\nAvailable 19-inch machined aluminum or 20-inch chrome-clad wheels\nOptional xenon headlamps\nOptional two-panel power sunroof with tilt-sliding front and fixed rear, with sunshade\n\nInterior\nThe Acadia features a two-tone interior with metal-finished trim accents on the vents, door handles and cupholders. With two captain’s chairs in the second row maximum seating capacity is seven, but with a 60/40-split bench there’s room for eight. The second- and third-row seats fold flat, and items can be stored beneath the rear cargo floor. The second row slides forward to increase legroom for third-row passengers, and it makes it easier to get to the third row.\n\nThere’s 154.0 cubic feet of passenger space in the Acadia, and with the second and third rows folded, there’s 116.9 cubic feet of cargo space. That eclipses the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-9. The Acadia even has more cargo volume with the seats down than a Yukon. Cargo space shrinks to about 24 cubic feet with all the seats up.\n\nStandard remote keyless entry and cruise control\nOptional leather seats\nOptional ultrasonic parking assist and rearview camera\nOptional backseat entertainment system\nOptional navigation system\nOptional heated and cooled seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll Acadias come standard with a 288-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 270 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. They also make use of direct-injection technology that improves efficiency.\n\nPower steering with variable assist reduces power assist at speed\nAvailable intelligent all-wheel drive manages torque split between the front and rear axles, putting more power to different axles as needed\nLinked “H” rear suspension design reduces noise and vibration in the cabin\n\nSafety\nThe Acadia includes many common safety features and a few rarities for this price range. Side curtain airbags are designed to pre-emptively engage if there’s imminent threat of a rollover and stay inflated longer during a rollover.\n\nSide-impact and side curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system and traction control\nFour-disc antilock brakes\nOnStar comes standard, including one free year of Safe and Sound service, which alerts authorities in the event of a collision",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2013 about the 2013 GMC Acadia. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhen suburbia was overrun by large, inefficient SUVs, along came the crossover to make the anti-minivan crowd happy.\n\nGeneral Motors’ three-row crossover triplets — the Chevy Traverse, Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia — hit all those shoppers’ needs. They’re the largest crossovers in terms of cargo and interior room while still feeling relatively nimble around parking lots and carpool lanes.\n\nFor 2013, all three have been updated. You can compare the 2013 and 2012 GMC Acadia here.\n\nThe 2013 GMC Acadia’s biggest change is on the outside, where a monstrous new grille will draw attention at soccer games, but there isn’t much else that’s new to make the Acadia stand out from the pack.\n\nLuckily for GMC, the competition hasn’t delivered a knockout punch of its own … yet.\n\nPerformance\nThe thing to remember about the Acadia throughout this review is just how big it is. At 200.8 inches long, it’s 3.7 inches longer than a Ford Explorer, 3.6 inches longer than a Nissan Pathfinder and 9.4 inches longer than a Honda Pilot. It also outweighs those three by 122 pounds, 471 pounds and 350 pounds, respectively.\n\nThat’s why its V-6 needs to produce 288 horsepower to get it moving.\n\nThe Acadia doesn’t feel fast when accelerating from a stop or at highway speeds. It does just enough to get the job done — even with my family on board — but nothing more. To be fair, there aren’t many three-row crossovers that are exhilarating behind the wheel … at least not without much more powerful engines under the hoods of more expensive nameplates. The Explorer’s base V-6 produces 290 hp but doesn’t feel noticeably quicker.\n\nAround town, the Acadia remains unbelievably nimble for its size. Light steering and excellent visibility add to a feeling of effortlessness that will be a big selling point for errand-running families.\n\nI also found it easy to park. The driver gets a good sense of where all four corners of the crossover are — the lack of which was a fault I found in the Explorer and others in the class.\n\nPushing the Acadia to its limits while cornering isn’t advisable. This is a large SUV, after all, and that’s an area where the Ford has a slight edge. In this class, though, nothing handles like the Mazda CX-9.\n\nThe Acadia’s ride is about average; one editor thought the optional 19-inch wheels didn’t help matters. I had no complaints about road and wind noise.\n\nGas mileage for front-wheel-drive models is rated at 17/24 mpg city/highway, 19 mpg combined. All-wheel-drive models like the one I tested lose a single mpg on all three figures. These numbers are about average for the class, with only the Nissan Pathfinder offering significantly better returns of 22 mpg combined.\n\nDuring my winter testing over a few hundred miles of driving, the trip computer showed better than 14 mpg only once. This was poor. Even in cold weather and on my mileage-killing commute and errand-running, test cars typically perform at their city mileage rating. I tested an even-thirstier four-wheel-drive Ford F-150 with a turbocharged V-6, rated 15/21/17 mpg, in identical conditions during even colder temperatures, and its computer showed mileage of 15 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Acadia is in a tough spot when it comes to pleasing families who live in upscale digs. A starting price of $34,945, including an $895 destination charge, puts it at least $3,500 above most of the competition. Is its interior worthy of that extra dough? Not at all.\n\nI don’t want to be repetitive, but while the fit and finish and materials are good enough, shoppers might prefer the futuristic look of the Explorer or the elegant look of the Pathfinder versus the Acadia’s no-frills layout.\n\nThe front seats have wide seat bottoms and, in my test car, the leather surfaces were quite comfortable. The Acadia’s interior just doesn’t feel premium. Even the gauges — which seem untouched from the previous model — look outdated and low-rent.\n\nIt also features an updated version of GM’s MyLink multimedia system. The system itself is simple enough to use in terms of how menus progress and how various settings are laid out. The 6.5-inch screen is a bit small, though, and placed too low in your field of vision. Most competitors, like Nissan, have 8-inch screens.\n\nWhat I and other editors thought was the worst failing was the integration of capacitive touch “buttons” surrounding the screen itself. These are actually just labeled areas on a flat piece of plastic that, when you touch them — with ungloved fingers — activate a specific digital command.\n\nThe Home button, which you’ll use a lot, is hard to hit blindly. Even worse, though, the controls for the trip computer that displays between the gauges are in this same cluster and require an added glance to locate. All this fumbling is one of the reasons we’ve found executions of capacitive touch in many cars to add a significant level of distraction that isn’t needed in modern vehicles, which are already extremely tech-laden.\n\nFamily-Friendliness & Cargo\nYou simply can’t ignore the Acadia’s spaciousness. If you’re a family that uses all three rows routinely, the Acadia has 24.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind them. That tops the Explorer, at 21 cubic feet; the Pilot, 18 cubic feet; and the Pathfinder, 16 cubic feet (see these competitors compared side-by-side). That gave me plenty of room for grocery runs, and it could easily accommodate soccer players and their gear for practice.\n\nThe Acadia bests the rest in terms of maximum cargo room, too, but passenger volume is just equal to the Explorer and a bit less than the Pilot and Pathfinder.\n\nThis is where families need to judge how often they use that third row and how much stuff they need to carry. Or, conversely, how comfortable they want their passengers to be.\n\nOf course, going the minivan route is more practical than any three-row crossover; a Honda Odyssey, for example, packs 13 percent more passenger volume and 28 percent more cargo volume than the Acadia (see them compared).\n\nMinivans and some large crossovers, like the Pathfinder, also do a much better job with entry height. My 5-year-old son can climb into almost any car I bring home to test, but he couldn’t manage the Acadia on his own. Both he and my 3½-year-old daughter were able to climb into the Pathfinder we tested a few months earlier with ease. Both actually raved about it.\n\nBase SLE-1 Acadias come standard with a second-row bench seat, for a total seat count of eight. Two captain’s chairs change that number to seven and are standard on the SLE-2 trim and upward. But the bench seat is a no-cost option in higher trims if you do need that extra spot.\n\nCars.com’s certified child-seat technicians put the Acadia through a thorough check of how it handles a variety of car seats. The captain’s chairs simplified third-row access. The sliding second-row seats also helped provide plenty of room for infant, convertible and booster seats. However, installing the infant seat in the second row was a struggle, and there were no Latch connectors in the third row.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nIf the Acadia’s space isn’t enough to wow you, its sticker price will likely make you pass on it entirely.\n\nAt a starting price of $34,945, you get a decent amount of content, including a backup camera, a six-speaker stereo, Bluetooth, a USB port, cruise control and parking sensors. But there you’re dealing with cloth seats and a manual driver’s seat.\n\nThat price is nearly $3,500 more than the base Chevy Traverse, which has less standard content, like parking sensors, but does have Bluetooth, cruise control and a backup camera.\n\nThe competition has even lower starting prices, with the Explorer, Pathfinder and Pilot all starting below $31,000, including destination, with similar equipment levels.\n\nAcadia prices reach much higher — nearly $45,000 — as you move to the top trim level, the SLT-2.\n\nBut GMC has an even pricier model, called the Acadia Denali, that has more flash outside, including unique bumpers and wheels, as well as more features inside, starting at $46,840.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Acadia is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test. Though the 2013 model has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2012 version was awarded a five-star combined rating, and the Acadia hasn’t been re-engineered, so those results still apply.\n\nYou can find a list of standard safety features here.\n\nAcadia in the Market\nThe Acadia is a solid crossover for those who need space and can’t fathom minivan ownership. However, its price, hit-or-miss interior and flawed gadgetry open holes of doubt for shoppers in this crowded segment.\n\nCan the styling alone draw shoppers? Yes, and they’ll be treated to a good crossover. The thing is, you’ll find just as good a vehicle in the Chevy Traverse for less money — let alone the competition, which you can get for even less.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "A GMC Acadia is not a vehicle for the timid or shy, especially if you’re rocking the top-of-the-line 2012 GMC Acadia Denali. It’s big and blingy, and it does what it’s supposed to do incredibly well: It comfortably transports families.\n\nEven for an extroverted momma like me, the Acadia Denali was a whole lotta car, but I can’t deny how easy it made daily life and how much I adored this behemoth. If you get behind the wheel of a 2012 Acadia Denali, just embrace the attitude on the road. Flaunt it with your family — well, at least that’s what I did.\n\nIf attitude and bling isn’t your thing, you still can reap the benefits of choosing a GMC Acadia as your family vehicle. To start, it’s a three-row SUV that can realistically transport seven passengers. Eight seats are optional. If you’re a family that shuns the minivan, the Acadia is a more than qualified stand-in, too.\n\nAlthough the Acadia’s current look has been around for a while (the 2013 Acadia gets a redesign), it’s surprising how well it holds up today. Sure, some things are a little dated, but it drives well and its V-6 engine delivers plenty of power should you need it. I was relieved to find it didn’t have that “boaty-floaty” feeling on the road. It delivered a smooth, comfortable ride.\n\nThere are some learning curves to handling it on the road — most notably, using those blind spot mirrors — but it’s not as unmanageable as it seems due to its size. Even with the added blind spot mirrors, I still had some close calls when I didn’t notice a few cars in neighboring lanes. That shook my confidence considerably when driving on busy freeways and changing lanes.\n\nA base GMC Acadia starts at $33,660 including an $825 destination charge, but my top-trim level front-wheel-drive Denali model in all of it’s over-the-top glory costs $49,615.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe GMC Acadia Denali’s boxy exterior is starting to show its age, especially when compared to the forward-thinking design of the Ford Flex or the sleekness of the Mazda CX-9, which are two of its competitors.\n\nBut the Denali’s chrome details still manage to turn more than a few heads. Its large grille, shiny wheels and big stature command respect on the road, which could have a direct impact on the respect you start commanding on the road as well. One thing’s for certain — it’s still a vehicle with both mom and dad appeal. The Acadia Denali comes off as masculine from some angles, but there are some elegant design touches and considerable bling that lends potential to a fight for the keys.\n\nThe exterior’s design has potential to cause a few problems for families, though. It’s on the tall side, so small children, as well as short or less-limber adults, may need a real step-up to get inside. The doors are heavy, too. Perhaps a little exertion can just add to the family’s fitness regime? Fortunately, there was a power liftgate that added convenience to loading up the cargo area.\n\nWith the third row folded, the cargo area is an enormous 68.9 cubic feet. It can handle just about anything you’d need to pack. I immediately thought how great this space could be for a camping trip or even a mom in charge of the snack shack at Little League games. As usual, using the third row significantly shrinks the cargo area behind it, but even with the third row up, my stroller fit in the back (on its side), or I had enough room for a shopping trip. Underneath the cargo floor is additional storage compartments that I loved. I could stow my reusable shopping bags, picnic blanket and first-aid kit without sacrificing valuable cargo space.\n\nIf you are in the market for an Acadia, your needs for transporting passengers and gear most likely outweigh fuel economy. With its 288-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine, the Acadia gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway. I definitely felt the sting during my test week as I was primarily in the city. However, when my family took a day trip and logged just over 200 miles mostly on the highway, we managed to stay just above the Acadia’s combined city/highway estimate of 19 mpg. Fortunately, the Acadia just requires regular gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nI’m hard-pressed to think of many negatives when it comes to the Acadia Denali’s interior. The SUVs versatility and functionality won me over despite a few aesthetic issues.\n\nTo begin, the Acadia’s second-row captain’s chairs are some of the best. They’re easy to slide forward and back, which makes for excellent access to the third row. A further bonus of the captain’s chairs is third-row access between the seats. This is especially useful if you’ve got child-safety seats installed in the second row. The biggest surprise? Fold down a captain’s chair and that flat surface becomes a great changing table on the run! If you need room for eight, the captain’s chairs can be replaced with an optional three-seat bench.\n\nI didn’t have a huge need for a third row, so most of the time I folded a portion of its 60/40-split seats to accommodate a passenger along with my stroller. Third-row passengers in an Acadia are afforded more legroom than in most three-row vehicles, but I’m not sure that full-sized adults would enjoy extended trips in the last row.\n\nEverybody had a lot of legroom in the Acadia. There’s ample storage for all in addition to the cargo area. With eight cupholders and bottleholders, a deep glove box, a covered bin on top of the dash, a center console and seatback pockets for the second row, everyone can bring what they want along for the ride.\n\nThanks to generous room between the front and second rows, my front passenger could stretch his legs and recline the seatback a bit, even with a rear-facing child-safety seat behind him. Second-row passengers in my upgraded Denali also enjoyed their own heated seats, air vents and wireless headphones to watch a movie on the rear entertainment system.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 GMC Acadia has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in IIHS’ front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also earned an overall safety score of five stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received four stars out of five in frontal and rollover crash tests and five stars in side crash tests.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the Acadia’s captain’s chairs was easy. The two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row are out in the open and easy to access. I especially liked that the captain’s chairs can slide forward so you can reach little ones. It’s disappointing that the Acadia does not offer Latch anchors in the third row. With so much room to haul passengers, it seems like a major oversight.\n\nThe 2012 Acadia Denali has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and anti-roll control, a backup camera, parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. A one-year subscription to OnStar is also standard. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 GMC Acadia Denali here.",

      "expert_review": "When suburbia was overrun by large, inefficient SUVs, along came the crossover SUV to make the anti-minivan crowd happy.\n\nGeneral Motors’ three-row crossover triplets — the Chevy Traverse, Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia — hit all those shoppers’ needs. They’re the largest crossovers in terms of cargo and interior room while still feeling relatively nimble around parking lots and carpool lanes.\n\nFor 2013, all three have been updated. You can compare the 2013 and 2012 GMC Acadia here.\n\nThe 2013 GMC Acadia’s biggest change is on the outside, where a monstrous new grille will draw attention at soccer games, but there isn’t much else that’s new to make the Acadia stand out from the pack.\n\nLuckily for GMC, the competition hasn’t delivered a knockout punch of its own … yet.\n\nPerformance\nThe thing to remember about the Acadia throughout this review is just how big it is. At 200.8 inches long, it’s 3.7 inches longer than a Ford Explorer, 3.6 inches longer than a Nissan Pathfinder and 9.4 inches longer than a Honda Pilot. It also outweighs those three by 122 pounds, 471 pounds and 350 pounds, respectively.\n\nThat’s why its V6 needs to produce 288 horsepower to get it moving.\n\nThe all-wheel GMC Acadia doesn’t feel fast when accelerating from a stop or at highway speeds. It does just enough to get the job done — even with my family on board — but nothing more. To be fair, there aren’t many three-row crossovers that are exhilarating behind the wheel … at least not without much more powerful engines under the hoods of more expensive nameplates. The Explorer’s base V6 produces 290 hp but doesn’t feel noticeably quicker.\n\nAround town, the Acadia remains unbelievably nimble for its size. Light steering and excellent visibility add to a feeling of effortlessness that will be a big selling point for errand-running families.\n\nI also found it easy to park. Steering is easy and the driver gets a good sense of where all four corners of the crossover are — the lack of which was a fault I found in the Explorer and others in the class.\n\nPushing the GMC Acadia to its limits while cornering isn’t advisable. This is a large SUV, after all, and that’s an area where the Ford has a slight edge. In this class, though, nothing handles like the Mazda CX-9.\n\nThe Acadia’s ride is about average; one editor thought the optional 19-inch alloy wheels didn’t help matters. I had no complaints about road and wind noise.\n\nGas mileage for front-wheel-drive models is rated at 17/24 mpg city/highway, 19 mpg combined. All-wheel-drive (AWD) models like the one I tested lose a single mpg on all three figures. All models come paired with a six-speed automatic. These numbers are about average for the class, with only the Nissan Pathfinder offering significantly better returns of 22 mpg combined.\n\nDuring my winter testing over a few hundred miles of driving, the trip computer showed better than 14 mpg only once. This was poor. Even in cold weather and on my mileage-killing commute and errand-running, test cars typically perform at their city mileage rating. I tested an even-thirstier AWD Ford F-150 with a turbocharged V6 paired to an automatic, rated 15/21/17 mpg, in identical conditions during even colder temperatures, and its computer showed mileage of 15 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe GMC Acadia is in a tough spot when it comes to pleasing families who live in upscale digs. A starting price of $34,945, including an $895 destination charge, puts it at least $3,500 above most of the competition. Is its interior worthy of that extra dough? Not at all.\n\nI don’t want to be repetitive, but while the fit and finish and materials are good enough, shoppers might prefer the futuristic look of the Explorer or the elegant look of the Pathfinder versus the Acadia’s no-frills layout.\n\nThe front seats have wide seat bottoms and, in my test car, the leather seat surfaces were quite comfortable. The Acadia’s interior just doesn’t feel premium. Even the gauges — which seem untouched from the previous model — look outdated and low-rent.\n\nIt also features an updated version of GM’s MyLink multimedia system. The system itself is simple enough to use in terms of how menus progress and how various settings are laid out. The 6.5-inch screen is a bit small, though, and placed too low in your field of vision. Most competitors, like Nissan, have 8-inch screens.\n\nWhat I and other editors thought was the worst failing was the integration of capacitive touch “buttons” surrounding the screen itself. These are actually just labeled areas on a flat piece of plastic that, when you touch them — with ungloved fingers — activate a specific digital command.\n\nThe Home button, which you’ll use a lot, is hard to hit blindly. Even worse, though, the controls for the trip computer that displays between the gauges are in this same cluster and require an added glance to locate. All this fumbling is one of the reasons we’ve found executions of capacitive touch in many cars to add a significant level of distraction that isn’t needed in modern vehicles, which are already extremely tech-laden.\n\nFamily-Friendliness & Cargo\nYou simply can’t ignore the GMC Acadia’s spaciousness. If you’re a family that uses all three rows routinely, the Acadia has 24.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind them. That tops the Explorer, at 21 cubic feet; the Pilot, 18 cubic feet; and the Pathfinder, 16 cubic feet (see these competitors compared side-by-side). That gave me plenty of room for grocery runs, and it could easily accommodate soccer players and their gear for practice.\n\nThe Acadia bests the rest in terms of maximum cargo room, too, but passenger volume is just equal to the Explorer and a bit less than the Pilot and Pathfinder.\n\nThis is where families need to judge how often they use that third row and how much stuff they need to carry. Or, conversely, how comfortable they want their passengers to be.\n\nOf course, going the minivan route is more practical than any three-row crossover; a Honda Odyssey, for example, packs 13 percent more passenger volume and 28 percent more cargo volume than the GMC Acadia (see them compared).\n\nMinivans and some large crossovers, like the Pathfinder, also do a much better job with entry height. My 5-year-old son can climb into almost any car I bring home to test, but he couldn’t manage the Acadia on his own. Both he and my 3½-year-old daughter were able to climb into the Pathfinder we tested a few months earlier with ease. Both actually raved about it.\n\nBase SLE-1 Acadias come standard with a second-row bench seat, for a total seat count of eight. Two captain’s chairs change that number to seven and are standard on the SLE-2 trim and upward. But the bench seat is a no-cost option in higher trims if you do need that extra spot.\n\nCars.com’s certified child-seat technicians put the Acadia through a thorough check of how it handles a variety of car seats. The captain’s chairs simplified third-row access. The sliding second-row seats also helped provide plenty of room for infant, convertible and booster seats. However, installing the infant seat in the second row was a struggle, and there were no Latch connectors in the third row.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nIf the GMC Acadia’s space isn’t enough to wow you, its sticker price will likely make you pass on it entirely.\n\nAt a starting base price of $34,945, you get a decent amount of content, including a backup camera, a six-speaker stereo, Bluetooth, a USB port, cruise control and parking sensors. But there you’re dealing with cloth seats and a manual driver’s seat.\n\nThat price is nearly $3,500 more than the base Chevy Traverse, which has less standard content, like parking sensors, but does have Bluetooth, cruise control and a backup camera.\n\nThe competition has even lower starting prices, with the Explorer, Pathfinder and Pilot all starting below $31,000, including destination, with similar equipment levels.\n\nAcadia prices reach much higher — nearly $45,000 — as you move to the top trim level, the SLT-2.\n\nBut GMC has an even pricier model, called the Acadia Denali, that has more flash outside, including unique bumpers and wheels, as well as more features inside, starting at $46,840.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 GMC Acadia is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, representing top scores in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test. The 2013 Acadia comes with anti-lock brakes and also earns a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nYou can find a list of standard safety features here.\n\nAcadia in the Market\nThe GMC Acadia is a solid crossover for those who need space and can’t fathom minivan ownership. However, its price, hit-or-miss interior and flawed gadgetry open holes of doubt for shoppers in this crowded segment.\n\nCan the styling alone draw shoppers? Yes, and they’ll be treated to a good body-type crossover. The thing is, you’ll find just as good a vehicle in the Chevy Traverse for less money — let alone the competition, which you can get for even less.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Adding glitzy Denali details to the already fabulous 2011 GMC Acadia seems like a perfect marriage. And it was, with the exception of a few minor dislikes for this three-row crossover.\n\nWith a bold yet beautiful body, the Acadia Denali is certainly attractive. It has a signature honeycomb Denali grille, oversized alloy wheels and plenty of chrome to set it apart from the standard Acadia.\n\nThe Denali’s V-6 engine offers speedy acceleration. The brakes are plenty powerful, which took the intimidation out of driving this larger crossover; the suspension is comfy without being too soft. During a family outing to the circus, we all noticed a significant amount of road noise in the cabin, especially on the highway. For a luxury vehicle, I expected more refinement here.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the extra touches the Acadia Denali delivered, I kept asking myself if these touches justified the significant price difference between this loaded $49,525 beauty with all-wheel drive and the base Acadia SL model with front-wheel drive that starts at $32,000.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Acadia Denali can be compared to your favorite pair of jeans. It looks great, flatters your features and is durable enough to stand up to the day-to-day rigors of real life.\n\nFog lights and dual exhaust pipes add style to punctuate both the front and rear. They also help diminish the mommy-mobile flag flying from the antenna. A true jack-of-all-trades, the Acadia Denali comes with optional all-wheel drive and an available tow hitch, helping to increase the Acadia’s masculine appeal while adding even more functionality.\n\nSize was a slight issue with Acadia Denali because I’m short — so are my kids — so climbing in and out took some effort. The doors were cumbersome and heavy, which made them difficult for my 5-year-old to operate. To be fair, the size of the doors can also be a bonus since the second-row doors are wider than average, which creates more space to manipulate those bulky child-safety seats and unruly toddlers. However, the combination of the sizable step-in height and heavy doors could make this crossover difficult to get in and out for older folks.\n\nWith such heavy doors, I was happy that the Denali had a power liftgate. I wasn’t thrilled with the cargo space, however. With the third row up, I found myself wanting more cargo area. I could get my groceries loaded two-bags deep, but most grocery trips require more cargo room than the Denali offered. Yes, the third row can be folded flat, but if your kids regularly use it, you’ll need to move any third-row car seats and kid debris before each shopping trip. Yuk! My solution was to drop only one of the third-row seats, which gave me more room, but did not disrupt the car seat I had back there.\n\nThe Acadia Denali has a 288-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that uses regular gas. The all-wheel-drive Acadia gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. Choosing a front-wheel-drive version improves gas mileage to 17/24 mpg. I averaged just over 16 mpg during my weeklong test drive, which included mostly city driving. GMC needs to put some effort into making this crossover more fuel efficient.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile the Acadia Denali’s upgraded exterior is apparent, the interior falls a little flat. It looks good, but it’s not an up-to-date look. The instrument cluster was blah-looking and seemed outdated in today’s world of LCD screens.\n\nMy family of four was right at home inside the seven-seater and not just because it came equipped with the optional rear entertainment system (though this is the only feature my kids will remember). In the front row, the leather seats are firm and highly adjustable with lumbar support for both driver and passenger.\n\nThe center stack is easy to navigate and doesn’t overwhelm with too many buttons and controls. This made operating the radio, DVD player and air-conditioning system easy and confusion-free. Even though the instrument cluster seemed outdated, I was happy to see the head-up display project my speed onto the windshield and my line of vision; this kept me from taking my eyes off the road for speedometer checks.\n\nFor the most part, visibility was great from the driver’s seat, and the optional backup camera made it even easier to safely navigate busy parking lots. I was not so fond of the second-row DVD screen, which popped down from the ceiling and seriously obstructed my view. While this inconvenience is hard to avoid with entertainment systems in general, there are automakers that have successfully engineered solutions.\n\nI jumped for joy when I first saw the captain’s chairs in the second row. In addition to providing easy access to the third row, these chairs also create an invisible barrier between my kids, making it harder for them to annoy/hit/smack/poke and/or spit on each other. A second-row bench is available. Second-row cupholders were located in the doors, which can be hard to reach for younger kids.\n\nThe third-row bench seats three and is split 60/40. Legroom is more restricted than in the second row, but the second-row occupants can slide their seats forward to share the wealth. The cupholders also are easier to reach.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 GMC Acadia, including the Denali trim, has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Acadia received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also has a standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe Acadia Denali also has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, anti-roll control, traction control and six airbags, including curtain airbags for all three rows. Its optional safety features include all-wheel drive and rear parking sensors with a backup camera.\n\nOnStar communication service is also standard in the Acadia Denali.\n\nThe Acadia Denali has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second-row captain’s chairs. They were easy to locate and just as easy to use since they stick out of the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. I only wish there had been another set in the third row.\n\nEven though the second row’s seat cushions seemed short, a bulky rear-facing infant-safety seat and a convertible car seat fit easily. For added convenience, the captain’s chairs slide forward and back, so you can pull those babies closer to you or push the seats back to make room for longer legs.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2011 GMC Acadia Denali here.",

      "expert_review": "GMC downsized its Acadia for 2017 from full-size to midsize. It hasn’t lost its third row, but that row now seats just two, so seating capacity is seven instead of eight. Compare the 2017 Acadia with its 2016 predecessor here. See how the Acadia’s features and specs compare with the Highlander’s, Pilot’s and Explorer’s here. The new GMC Acadia has a superior driving experience, upgraded available safety and multimedia technology, a classier interior — and a slightly lower price.\n\nThe 2017 Acadia will go on sale later this spring with six trim levels; four- and six-cylinder engines; a six-speed automatic transmission; and front- or all-wheel drive in all trims except the base SL trim, which is only available with front-wheel drive.\n\nTo cover another base, GMC also offers a two-row, five-seat Acadia. Branded an Acadia SLT with All Terrain Package, the five-seat version has a more aggressive look and an upgraded all-wheel-drive system. It aims to peel off some sales from Jeep’s successful two-row Grand Cherokee.\n\nI drove a well-optioned Acadia Denali trim, an SLT-1 with the All Terrain Package, and an SLT-1 with the new four-cylinder.\n\nHedging its bets a little, GMC will continue to sell a previous-generation Acadia Limited through early 2017.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\n\nFormerly a sibling of the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse, the new Acadia rides a version of the new 2017 Cadillac XT5’s platform. Overall, the new Acadia is 7.2 inches shorter, 3.5 inches narrower and 4.4 inches lower than the 2016. Compare the 2017 Acadia to its 2016 predecessor here.\n\nParked in a row with its competitors, the slimmed-down Acadia fits right in. Deviation from class-average dimensions by any of them is usually only about a half-inch, and at most it’s about 3 inches.\n\nWith the new Acadia, GMC shows again that it’s not afraid of chrome. There’s a family resemblance to the previous version in the 2017’s traditional, sit-up-straight SUV profile and conservative styling; it will not be mistaken for a new Nissan Murano. The 2017 is, however, more rounded and sculpted than the boxy 2016.\n\nWhile the Denali and SLT-1 give off an upscale vibe, to me the looker of the Acadia lineup is the one with the $1,800 All Terrain Package. It has a sportier look, with a body-colored grille surround, blackened trim and its own darkened 20-inch wheels.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThis is still a tall SUV; you won’t mistake it for a sport sedan. But neither will you mistake it for the old Acadia, which had nearly minivan manners. Comparing V-6 versions, the 2017 Acadia is down nearly 600 pounds versus the 2016, one GMC engineer said, thanks to its new size and a mix of lighter materials and new assembly techniques. An even lighter version can be had thanks to the new four-cylinder base engine, which makes for a vehicle that’s more than 700 pounds lighter than the lightest 2016.\n\nThe change is akin to a pair of NFL tackles climbing out the back of the Acadia, and you feel it when driving; the 2017 is car-like and surprisingly agile. The handling standout of the versions I drove was the Denali, which included an adaptive suspension (a $1,200 option on AWD versions). Sport mode firmed up the suspension nicely, making for a planted feel and little lean in cornering while still offering a good ride.\n\nSport also gives the all-wheel-drive Acadia a rear bias and alters its steering, accelerator and transmission settings in satisfying and not intrusive ways; you could make this your everyday mode if you were willing to pay a bit more for gas. Family bonus: This could also be your choice if you have kids prone to carsickness; there was noticeably less body motion in the rear seats on twisty roads.\n\nTime in models without the adaptive suspension, however, revealed a standard suspension that’s more than adequate for most tasks. Handling is confident, and the ride is nearly as comfortable. Well-tuned variable-assist steering goes from parking-lot easy to responsive at speed.\n\nThe new Acadia’s turning circle is a more manageable 38.7 feet, down from north of 40 feet. The braking feels linear, with expected bite in relation to pedal effort.\n\nAll GMC Acadias offer a mode selector. Front-drive models have Normal, Snow, Sport and Trailer/Tow modes, while all-wheel-drive models have 2×4 (disconnecting all-wheel drive for maximum gas mileage), 4×4, Sport, Off Road and Trailer/Tow.\n\nThe All Terrain Package includes an upgraded all-wheel-drive system with an electronic, dual-clutch rear differential. The system can shift torque in all directions, with nearly 100 percent going to a single wheel if needed.\n\nA surprise for me was the new, non-turbocharged base engine: a 193-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder. It’s certainly no neck-snapper – it takes more than 9 seconds to get to 60 mph, GMC says — but it didn’t induce white knuckles when passing or while merging on the freeway, though it keeps the transmission busy in highway cruising. The transmission tuning and gearing made it feel peppy in city driving. For cost-conscious buyers with mostly city and suburban driving needs, this could be a sensible choice.\n\nIf you aren’t feeling that sensible, though, the new-design 3.6-liter V-6 puts out a satisfying 310 hp and 271 pounds-feet of torque. GMC expects most buyers to pick it; the refined V-6 is a better fit for the GMC Acadia’s overall persona. Power delivery was strong, and it will tow up to 4,000 pounds, down from a 5,200 maximum for the 2016.\n\nBoth engines improve gas mileage over the 2016. The four-cylinder includes a stop-start function and the V-6 employs cylinder deactivation that makes it a V-4 under light loads. In keeping with GM’s new policy for its four-cylinder engines, stop-start cannot be turned off. You probably won’t mind, though, as it’s nearly seamless.\n\nThe result for front-wheel-drive models is EPA-estimated fuel economy of 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for a FWD four-cylinder and 18/25/21 mpg for the new V-6 with front-wheel drive, compared with the old model’s 15/22/18 mpg. The V-6 gives up 1 mpg in combined mileage with all-wheel drive, where the four gives up a mile in highway mileage. In a real-world drive on mostly highway and two-lane rural roads, the front-drive four-cylinder logged better than its highway rating, with 26.4 mpg on the trip computer, while driving an average 36 mph.\n\nInterior\n\n\nIn terms of spaciousness, the GMC Acadia and its rivals are closely matched — at least by the numbers. In feel and outward visibility, the Acadia seems as open and airy as the Toyota Highlander and just slightly less so than the taller, wider Pilot. All three best the snug, closed-in feel and visibility of the Explorer. Plus, the Acadia’s interior is impressively conversation-quiet on the road.\n\nThe new GMC Acadia’s interior is pleasant with subdued colors — with the exception of the more dramatic black-and-saddle leather interior of the All Terrain Package. The other color schemes are more modest than opulent, even in the decked-out Denali trim, with its wood accents and leather. Materials quality is good in the places where you touch; there’s still some hard plastic below elbow-level.\n\nThere’s seating for seven with a comfortable second-row bench or six with second-row captain’s chairs. The All Terrain Package fits just five, as it drops the third row in favor of large underfloor storage bins.\n\nThe sliding and reclining second-row seat provides truly limo-like accommodations — if you don’t need to compromise space for someone in the third row. The two-seat third-row bench has sufficient padding and generous headroom, and it reclines. It sits low, however, leaving an adult’s knees elbow-high. That said, it can accommodate a 6-footer behind a same-size adult in the second row. Outboard pairs of Latch child-safety seat anchors are provided only for the second row; there are tethers in both the second and third rows.\n\nA tilt-and-slide feature on the curb-side captain’s chair or the smaller side of the 60/40-split bench allows access to the way back even with a forward-facing child seat in place. It operates with one hand but not as easily or smoothly as such seats in some of the competition — and it’s only on the curb side. It clears a space just narrow enough for entry; you’ll have to work on your low lunge in yoga class to handle the exit.\n\nThe interior retains some of the 2016’s van-like conveniences, such as ample storage, including a bread loaf-sized drawer for the second row in the center console, plus abundant cupholders and bottleholders. The Denali also includes tri-zone climate control, with vents and separate controls for the second row.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\n\nA 7-inch touchscreen with GMC’s IntelliLink system is standard on SL and SLE trims, and an 8-inch unit is optional on the SLE and standard on SLT and Denali models. The screen has big, clear buttons and menus, and it responds quickly. Knobs for volume and tuning make it easy to use, as do physical buttons for Home and Back, as well as basic audio functions.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard. The Acadia also offers emergency communications and a subscription-based 4G LTE connection via OnStar. A premium Bose eight-speaker audio system is optional.\n\nUSB connections abound, with two up front, two for the second row and another for the third. The backseat also has a 120-volt outlet, and some trims include rear audio controls with headphone jacks. There’s an available rear-seat entertainment system with two DVD players (no Blu-ray support), two 7-inch screens on the front head restraints, headphones, and USB and RCA ports; a less costly option is a set of tablet holders for the backs of the front seats.\n\nIn a first for GMC, there will be built-in apps developed jointly with an app partner; GMC plans to make more apps available through an app store. Among the first is a version of Glympse, which lets you share your vehicle’s location or keep track of your teenage driver.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\n\nThe new GMC Acadia’s trimmer size shows most here: Cargo room behind the third row has been cut nearly in half to a compact car-like 12.8 cubic feet, but there’s about 42 cubic feet with the third row down. Maximum cargo space is 79 cubic feet, down from a cavernous 116.1 in the old Acadia, but still competitive with the Highlander (82.6), Pilot (82.1) and Escape (80.7). Both rows of rear seats fold flat, and mechanical rear controls let you drop (but not raise) both while standing at the available power liftgate.\n\nLacking a third row, the All Terrain Package version has a long, wide, flat load floor behind the second row, opening to a pair of large storage bins under the floor. A rail-based cargo management system adds a moveable cargo barrier.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAs of this writing, the 2017 GMC Acadia had not been tested for crashworthiness by federal regulators or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. When it is, you’ll be able to find the results here.\n\nThe 2017 GMC Acadia ups its game significantly in safety technology, though to get everything offered you have to move up to at least an SLT trim. Collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection is available (it’s standard on SLT-2 and Denali trims), with a higher-speed system optional on the Denali. Also available are lane departure warning and lane departure prevention, blind spot warning, automatic high beams, front and rear park-assist sensors, and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nA backup camera with good definition is standard, while a relatively seamless 360-degree camera system is optional. An available Tow Vision trailering system offers a rear-camera view to line up your hitch, and you can also use it while driving forward to keep an eye on your trailer and cargo. See a full list of safety features here.\n\nA new safety feature, which GMC says is an industry first, is a standard Rear Seat Reminder that goes off when you shut off the vehicle if a rear door was opened just before or during the trip. Aimed to help prevent forgetting a child in the rear seats, it sounds an alert and displays a reminder on the dash to check the rear (it can be turned off).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nThe Acadia is offered in six trims, counting a stripped-down SL that starts at $29,995, including the destination charge. It’s available in just two colors with almost no options; it seems to be aimed more at getting Internet searches than sales. The starter for most buyers will be the more appealing and better-outfitted SLE-1, which comes in at $33,375 with front-wheel drive; add $2,000 for all-wheel drive. From there are the SLE-2, two levels of SLT (which GMC expects to account for more than 40 percent of sales) and the top Denali trim, which was responsible for a healthy 23 percent of Acadia sales last year, GMC says. It starts at $45,845, or $47,845 with all-wheel drive.\n\nThose prices are down versus the 2016 Acadia (see the details here), ranging from $1,905 less for the cheapest 2017 to $2,970 less for an all-wheel-drive 2017 GMC Acadia Denali. None of these three-row haulers are cheap, but an SLT with desirable options can now be had for less than $45,000. That puts it in a league with more-optioned versions of its rivals, as you can see here, while delivering a lot of capability, good handling and near-premium ride and sound insulation. Want more? The nearly all-in Acadia Denali I drove stickered for $52,285.\n\nThe new Acadia is a risk for GMC. It’s always tricky to try to reposition a successful product — to attempt to bring in new buyers while keeping the old. And there’s a lot on the line. The previous Acadia racked up more than 96,000 in sales last year, trailing only the compact Terrain SUV and Sierra full-size pickup in GMC’s lineup.\n\nBut I think the 2017 GMC Acadia is a case of less is more: The new Acadia is a trimmer, more agile, more efficient vehicle that can be had for less money while still meeting the three-row needs of most families. If you really need a minivan, though, buy one. Nothing beats it — including, in my view, the 2017 Acadia.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
