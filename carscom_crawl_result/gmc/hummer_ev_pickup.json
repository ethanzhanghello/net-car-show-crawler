      "expert_review": "The verdict: It’s as big, bold and brash as the original Hummers — but features technology and abilities that even those off-roaders couldn’t come close to matching.\n\nVersus the competition: The only thing out there that comes close in price and mission (so far) is the Rivian R1T, but it’s much smaller, much more luxurious and far less in-your-face.\n\nThere’s going to be a lot of noise about the new 2023 GMC Hummer EV pickup. People are likely going to say it’s too big, heavy and inefficient or that it’s too over-the-top and outrageously engineered. Those people are missing the point of what the new Hummer EV actually is — GM’s technology showcase for its next generation of electric drive systems and technologies that will soon form the basis of nearly everything the company makes, from compact commuter crossovers to full-size SUVs and beyond. The GMC Hummer EV is GM’s moonshot, its chance to grab the world’s attention with an act so incredible, so jaw-droppingly crazy that you can’t help but stop and take notice of what’s been done. That’s what the new Hummer is — all of GM’s brand-new electric technology that could have been crammed into a super-expensive Cadillac sedan or a two-person Chevrolet sports car, but nobody really pays attention to those anymore. Instead, the company took its latest toys and rolled them into the thing it does better than just about anyone: a full-size, off-road-capable, nuts-beyond-words pickup truck. And in this moonshot mission, the company has pulled off an extraordinary win.\n\nRelated: GMC Hummer EV Pickup Hits the Streets With 329-Mile Range, 7,500-Pound Max Towing\n\nAll the Goods in One Package\n\nThe big reason for the GMC Hummer EV’s existence (and yes, it’s a GMC, not a Hummer; the brand itself isn’t returning) is to show off the Ultium system — GM’s next-generation EV system. It comprises a new kind of modular lithium-ion battery pack that can charge at 800 volts, new drive motors and controllers, and new chassis platforms to house it all. The secret is that all of it is modular and scalable. At the top end, you’ve got this monster truck with three electric motors (one front, two rear); a huge two-layer, 24-module lithium-ion battery with 212.7 kilowatt-hours (usable) that can add 100 miles of range in as little as 12 minutes (depending on the DC fast charger you’re using); four-wheel steering; and a dedicated clean-sheet design platform made specifically for truck applications like this. However, the same system will be scaled down to be used in things like the upcoming Cadillac Lyriq SUV, with a 12-module, 100-kWh battery and rear-wheel drive.\n\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBut we’re here to talk about the Hummer EV, and taken as a stand-alone model, the new GMC is absolutely bonkers — in a good way. It starts with the styling, which is immediately recognizable as a Hummer, almost as if the brand hadn’t actually been killed off in 2009 as part of GM’s bankruptcy during the Great Recession. It’s a purposeful off-road look, and it’s as functional as it is dramatic — the approach angle is excellent, and the chamfers that cut out of the front bumper help with mounting obstacles out on a trail. It has an undeniable presence on the road as well, taking up what feels like most of its lane and turning heads left and right. It even drew some chest-thumping challenges from a bubba in a brodozer F-150 during my test drive. I couldn’t tell if he was upset that an electric pickup was physically bigger than his gas-powered one or if he was envious that my near-silent rock crawler could positively smoke his rumbling rig in a stoplight drag race.\n\nAll About Maneuverability\n\nThere’s one aspect of driving the Hummer EV that will leave you gobsmacked, and it’s not the one you think it will be. Yes, it can do 0-60 mph in an estimated 3 seconds flat when you’ve engaged a special acceleration mode called “Watts to Freedom” (WTF mode, get it?). I can attest that “Watts to Freedom!” is not what I exclaimed when trying this eyeball-flattening acceleration test in a closed-off parking lot in Phoenix, Ariz., recently. The unbelievable acceleration is just stunning — no vehicle that weighs this much (reportedly more than 9,000 pounds) should be this quick. Yes, it’s speed-limited to 106 mph, but you’re not likely to ever want to go that fast in it anyway given its sheer, massive bulk and the roar from the dedicated off-road tires reverberating around the cabin at highway speeds.\n\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nNo, the mind-melting acceleration is not what’s really surprising about the Hummer EV; it’s how maneuverable and remarkably agile it is thanks to its four-wheel steering. Imagine guiding a full-size pickup around a tight off-road course, but the back end swings around whenever you turn the wheel, creating a much tighter turning circle. Or negotiating a narrow downtown street full of cars parked on either side. Or a crowded Costco parking lot. All of these scenarios are turned into an absolute breeze by the Hummer EV thanks to rear-wheel steering that operates up to 10 degrees of movement, creating an agility on- or off-road that I wish could be had in other full-size trucks and SUVs. The Ford Bronco tries to simulate this in off-road conditions by selectively braking a wheel during turns on loose surfaces, but it can’t do it in a paved parking lot where you’re likely to need that tight maneuvering ability as much as out on a trail. The Hummer EV can and does, and you’ve never experienced anything like it in anything short of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nOne thing the Hummer EV does that no other vehicle on the planet does is CrabWalk. This is a setting, operated by a push of a dedicated button, that makes all four wheels steer in the same direction, allowing the truck to slide diagonally around an object. The effect is extraordinary, and it makes for some fun on-road showing off, but its usefulness off-road is still a bit in question. A full day of driving a trail through the Arizona countryside didn’t present me with an opportunity to actually need to engage the CrabWalk feature, but I suppose it’s fun to have the ability to do so should one need it. I sense that it might have more usefulness in turning heads at a local Cars & Coffee event than actually providing a useful feature off-road, but frankly, this isn’t a bad thing.\n\nOn-Road Tolerability, Off-Road Skillz\n\nI’ll not call the Hummer EV’s on-road manners civilized but merely tolerable. It’s noticeably big-truck heavy, which is disguised somewhat by its prodigious torque and agile low-speed maneuverability, but its steering feel is largely big-truck numb, due again in large part to the chonky off-road tires it wears. Those same tires also set up a good roar in the cabin at highway speeds, something that isn’t helped by the Hummer EV Edition 1’s standard “infinity roof,” a removable four-panel transparent roof that provides no sound deadening at all and lets all the sunlight through, despite being heavily tinted an unusual blue color. While it might have been fun to remove all four panels and enjoy the sounds of nature, ridiculously dusty conditions prevented us from trying this feature out — I will give props to GMC for a design that lets you store the removed panels in the Hummer’s frunk, letting you enjoy an open-air motoring experience while still bringing the top along with you, something the Jeep Wrangler still doesn’t allow for (but the four-door Ford Bronco does).\n\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOut on the street, driving the Hummer EV isn’t so different from driving any large pickup. Acceleration is impressive, braking performance is, too, and the truck is so heavy that hefty sidewinds on the highway don’t perturb it in the slightest. It rides well, with the combination of tall-sidewall tires and an adjustable air suspension providing a smooth, well-damped ride. Add in that rather surprising road noise, and you have an experience not unlike that of driving any dedicated off-road heavy-duty pickup.\n\nGet into the dirt, however, and the Hummer EV only continues to impress. There are two electronic modes dedicated to dirt driving — Off-Road and Terrain. Off-Road is the higher-speed setting, meant for quick passes through dry washes, loose gravel terrain and general shenanigans that require different wheel-slip allowances. It also sets up a special noise from the truck tied to acceleration, a kind of mild, fake engine noise, which is actually a useful audible cue to help you remember that you’re in Off-Road mode. The other off-road setting is Terrain mode, which is more of a rock-crawling, low-speed mode; it changes features like throttle application and rear steering rate. This gives the Hummer EV even more incredible maneuverability in the dirt, whipping around tight turns and obstacles with simply astonishing agility. In a vehicle with a smaller footprint, like the upcoming Hummer EV SUV with its 7-inch shorter wheelbase, this feature is going to be a stunning off-road game changer.\n\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThis was my first experience driving an electric off-road vehicle, and I’m now very much sold on the idea. The super-fine control allowed by the combination of carefully controlled electric motors and the addition of well-modulated friction brakes makes for an exceptionally confident experience. There’s no torque converter lag as you try to modulate throttle in uphill or downhill situations, and there’s no variable engine braking either. If you want more hill descent control, shift the transmission selector from Drive to Low, and the additional regenerative braking makes that happen (it works on-road, too, for one-pedal driving). It’s simple, effective and impressive.\n\nA Cabin That’s Over-the-Top Yet Not Quite Enough\n\nAs well as the exterior and hardware of the Hummer EV works, the cabin is perhaps less successful. On the positive side, you have the graphics of the 13.4-inch center-console touchscreen and the 12.3-inch driver information gauge cluster display, which are unlike anything I’ve ever seen in an automobile. The graphics have been developed by video game maker Epic Games using their Unreal Engine architecture, and as a result, you have displays that look like they’re straight out of a sci-fi game. While they do have a teeny bit of lag sometimes, the look and feel of the displays, from the Off-Road mode information to the animations displayed when switching between modes, make everyone grin. The gauge cluster is reconfigurable to one of several different styles, but the rectangular display is obscured to a large degree by the round steering wheel you have to look through to see it. This is an increasingly common problem with vehicles presenting squared-off displays behind round steering wheels (See the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach E, for example). It’s a trend that the latest Chevrolet Corvette and other models have avoided — but at the cost of a non-round steering wheel that at first seems weird but then becomes a no-brainer as you use it. Still, what you can see of the gauge display is awesome and is something I hope GM adopts for more vehicles down the road.\n\nThe Hummer EV’s cabin also succeeds in its space and comfort. A truck this big should have a lot of interior room, and it does, both up front and in back. The seats are big and well-bolstered but still all-day comfortable. Outward visibility is mixed: To the sides and rear, it’s acceptable thanks in part to the GMC’s big mirrors. But to the front, that squat Hummer-style windshield can be a problem at stoplights. You’ll be ducking down to see them, just like in a Wrangler or Bronco, thanks to that gun-slit-style bunker view out the front. Visibility on trails is not a problem, however, with the Edition 1’s multiple cameras. Eighteen different camera views are possible, including several views under the truck and an underbody camera that even has its own washer nozzle to rinse away any dust or mud.\n\nWhere the Hummer’s cabin tends to fall down is in materials quality. This is a very expensive truck, nearly $112,000 for this sold-out Edition 1 trim, but the interior materials do not live up to that price tag. We know that GM can do a stellar interior (witness the latest Cadillac Escalade for that), but despite the neat designs and industrial-chic look of the Hummer EV’s interior, there’s an unacceptably high level of hard-plastic and vinyl trim throughout that makes one grimace. It becomes abundantly clear that the price of this model covers all the tech goodies, not opulence or luxury.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCeiling the Deal: GMC’s Hummer Electric Truck to Feature Removable Roof Panels\n3 Things to Know About the 2022 GMC Hummer EV Pickup Truck\nElectric Hummer Performance Specs Are Out … and They’re Bonkers\nGMC Slows Electric Hummer Charge as Lincoln Pulls Plug on Rivian-Built SUV\nAwesome in Every Sense of the Word\n\nCabin materials aside, the new 2023 GMC Hummer EV is awesome in just about every sense of the word. Its on-road acceleration will leave you stunned. Its tight turning circles and incredible on- and off-road agility are unlike anything else being made today. The styling details, like LED headlights that flash in sequence as the truck is plugged into a charger, are little surprise-and-delight features that run through the entire experience of driving the truck. Yes, it’s heavy. No, it’s not the most efficient EV on the market. No, it can’t tow as much as most light-duty pickups, with a capacity of just 7,500 pounds. None of that matters with this truck — it’s meant to be an eye-opener, a shot across the bow of every other automaker planning an electric truck, and a statement that says, “Look what I can do!”\n\nI’d say the Hummer EV’s mission to get me to notice GM’s new tech is a smashing success. I’m now far more curious about the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra EVs than I was before, having been given a sample of the technology that’s going to trickle down into those upcoming trucks in the next few years. Until then, the Hummer EV remains the most awesome off-road electric vehicle out there.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup is a full-size electric pickup truck that comes solely as a crew cab with five seats. Previously, Hummer was a stand-alone GM brand — populated by brash, gas-powered SUVs and trucks — that was discontinued in the wake of the Great Recession. New Hummers are under the GMC brand and are all-electric vehicles, but they maintain the bold, boxy look of their predecessors. \n\nThe Hummer EV Pickup’s 2X trim has a two-motor all-wheel-drive system. The line-topping 3X adds a third electric motor and the option of a larger battery pack for increased driving range. Among this plus-size pickup’s novel features are T-top-style removable roof panels; four-wheel steering with a CrabWalk feature, enabling the vehicle to move diagonally; and an available Watts to Freedom acceleration mode that enables 0-60 mph runs in three seconds flat. The Hummer EV Pickup shares its basic platform with the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, and GMC also sells a Hummer EV SUV variant. Competitive electric pickups include the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nThe Hummer EV Pickup sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup Have?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 282-318 miles, depending on trim, battery pack and equipment.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nA Hummer EV can be charged to 100% on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger in eight to 10 hours. A 350-kilowatt DC fast charger can add up to 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s maximum towing capacity is 7,500-12,000 pounds, depending on trim and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup Weigh?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s base curb weight is 9,063 pounds.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\n13.4-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n14-speaker Bose stereo\nMultifunction configurable tailgate\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive air suspension  \n35-inch all-terrain tires\nCrabWalk four-wheel-steering feature\nWatts to Freedom acceleration mode\nRemovable transparent roof panels\nBed-mounted audio system\nBeadlock-capable wheels\nUnderbody skid plates\nPower-operated rear tonneau cover\nForward and rearward underbody camera systems\nShould I Buy the 2025 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup is as much about making a statement as it is about functionality, but it boasts several innovative features, mind-boggling acceleration and some truly impressive go-anywhere capability. That said, the quality of the cabin doesn’t quite live up to its prodigious price, and there’s a surprising amount of road noise at highway speeds. You’ll also want to plan your parking spots well ahead of time; the Hummer EV is more nimble than you’d imagine, but it commands a lot of acreage wherever it roams.",

      "expert_review": "The GMC Hummer EV is a gigantic, silly thing, and for the 2026 model year, it gets even sillier, but also more useful in situations few owners are likely to find themselves in. Deriving its name from Crab Walk, the Hummer EV’s ability to steer its rear wheels in the same direction as the fronts to drive diagonally, the new King Crab mode makes further use of the standard rear-wheel steering.\n\nRelated: 2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV on the Drag Strip: WTF Was That?\n\nKing Crab mode allows the rear wheels to steer faster than the fronts in the opposite direction, making the big EV easier to maneuver in tight off-road spaces. It is standard on the 2X and 3X trim levels of both the Hummer EV Pickup and SUV for 2026, and it will be available for all existing Hummer EVs through an over-the-air update later in 2025.\n\nAdding Lightness to Four Tons\n\nAs for silliness, GMC is hoping the go-fast appeal of carbon fiber extends to 4-ton trucks with the new 2026 GMC Hummer EV Carbon Fiber Edition. Produced in limited numbers for both the pickup truck and SUV, the Carbon Fiber Edition is available exclusively in Magnus Gray Matte exterior paint with an orange interior. It also gets carbon-fiber trim on the mirror caps and skid plate, black 22-inch wheels wearing all-terrain tires and black badging, front bumper trim and, for the pickup, a tonneau cover. Producing 1,160 horsepower and 13,000 pounds-feet of torque in pickup form, the Carbon Fiber Edition can accelerate from 0-60 mph in a claimed 2.8 seconds, 0.2 second quicker than before.\n\nWhat Else Is New for the 2026 Hummer EV?\n\nGMC also made a number of smaller updates across the Hummer EV lineup for 2026, including retuned dampers for improved ride quality and bidirectional charging that allows drivers to use the Hummer EV to charge other EVs or power their home during a blackout. The latest version of GM’s Super Cruise semi-autonomous hands-free highway driving tech is available and will now perform automated lane changes when traveling to a destination under the guidance of the onboard navigation system. There are also two new paint and interior options.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe updated 2026 GMC Hummer EV will arrive at dealerships later in 2025. Pricing will be announced closer to the start of sales.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Pickup: 7 Things We Like and 3 We Don’t\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV?\n2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV Review: (4) Tons of Fun!\nWhat Is the GMC Hummer EV’s CrabWalk Feature?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 GMC Hummer EV?\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV is a full-size electric pickup truck that comes solely as a crew cab with five seats. Hummer was previously a stand-alone GM brand — a line of brash, gas-powered SUVs and trucks that was discontinued in the wake of the Great Recession. The new Hummers are under the GMC brand and are all-electric vehicles, but they maintain the bold, boxy look of their predecessors.\n\nThe Hummer EV’s 2 and 2X trims have a two-motor all-wheel-drive system. The line-topping 3X trim adds a third electric motor and the option of a larger battery pack for increased driving range. Among this plus-size pickup’s novel available features are T-top-style removable roof panels; four-wheel steering with a CrabWalk feature that enables the vehicle to move diagonally; and a Watts to Freedom acceleration mode that enables 0-60 mph runs in 3 seconds flat. The Hummer EV shares its basic platform with the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, and GMC also sells the Hummer EV SUV. Competitive electric pickups include the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T and Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 GMC Hummer EV Pickup?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s model lineup expands beyond the top-line 3X variantfor 2024 to include the slightly more affordable 2 and 2X trims. With its available larger battery pack, the 3X’s driving range  increases to an estimated 381 miles.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 GMC Hummer EV Have?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s estimated driving range runs from 311 to 381 miles, depending on trim and battery pack.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 GMC Hummer EV?\n\nA Hummer EV can be charged to full on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger in 8-10 hours. A 350-kilowatt DC fast charger can add up to 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.\n\nWhat is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 GMC Hummer EV?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s maximum towing capacity is 7,500 to 12,000 pounds, depending on trim and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 GMC Hummer EV Weigh?\n\nThe Hummer EV’s base curb weight is 9,063 pounds.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 GMC Hummer EV Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\n13.4-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n14-speaker Bose stereo\nMulti-function configurable tailgate\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive air suspension\n35-inch all-terrain tires\nCrabWalk four-wheel-steering feature\nWatts to Freedom acceleration mode\nRemovable transparent roof panels\nBed-mounted audio system\nBeadlock-capable wheels\nUnderbody skid plates\nPower-operated rear tonneau cover\nForward and rearward underbody camera systems\nShould I Buy the 2024 GMC Hummer EV?\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV is as much about making a statement as it is about functionality, but it boasts several innovative features, mind-boggling acceleration and some truly impressive go-anywhere capability. That being said, the quality of the cabin doesn’t quite live up to its prodigious price, and there’s a surprising amount of road noise at highway speeds. You’ll also want to plan your parking spots well ahead of time; the Hummer EV is more nimble than you’d imagine, but it still commands a lot of acreage wherever it roams.",
