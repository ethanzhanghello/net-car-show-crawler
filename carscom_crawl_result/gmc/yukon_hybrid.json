      "expert_review": "As a former full-size-SUV owner, I know that driving a big vehicle is really about hauling people. But owning a Yukon Hybrid is more than that – it’s also about hauling gear, being comfortable on long trips and doing it all with a dash of green, earth-loving sassiness.\n\nThis green behemoth has spacious seating for seven and hauls a boat or pop-up camper with its 6,200-pound towing capacity. The Yukon Hybrid and its sister SUV, the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid, are two-mode hybrids. Don’t glaze over yet – this means they can run on a battery-powered engine – up to a point – in city driving and a powerful V-8 engine during highway cruising.\n\nKeeping the Yukon in battery mode became a game for my family – thrilling since the ABC road sign game gets old. While paying close attention to my driving I got close to 22 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving; otherwise my mileage averaged between 20 and 21 mpg. It was much harder for me to change my driving habits than I would have imagined. I had trouble adjusting to other drivers’ snooty impatience when I would slowly move away from a stop sign to stay in battery mode. Hybrid or not, I will have to make some adjustments to my lifestyle to up my fuel economy numbers.\n\nIn my day-to-day grocery-getting life, I loved that when my kids sat in the Yukon they weren’t even close to touching each other. I could easily fit three booster seats across the middle row (three five-point harness child-safety seats would also fit, depending upon their dimensions) and the kids were able to buckle their seat belts without any problems.\n\nI did feel a little uneasy about the nickel-metal hydride battery, which sits directly below the second-row seats. A GM engineer assured me it’s safe, but the idea of my kids sitting on top of a giant battery makes me feel about as comfortable as someone building an elementary school next to a power station.\n\nIf a family wants to maintain a lifestyle that includes moving kids, stuff and trailers, and occasionally going off the beaten path, then getting 20 mpg in the Yukon Hybrid is a lot more appealing than 15 mpg in its non-hybrid sister – that’s a 25 percent gain in fuel economy. But if high gas prices are making you consider a hybrid, I suggest stepping outside your SUV comfort zone altogether and broadening your hybrid horizons.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 GMC Yukon Hybrid and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThough gas mileage ratings for GM’s full-size SUVs are impressive among their competitive set, they aren’t likely to bring smiles to anyone at the pump; their combined ratings still linger in the teens. The Yukon Hybrid changes that, to a degree. Along with its twin, the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid, it promises an improvement in overall gas mileage. The Yukon Hybrid is only available with a short wheelbase and in two trim levels, but it can come with either rear- or four-wheel drive. It seats eight.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe Yukon Hybrid gets GM’s OnStar 9.0 telematics system that GM says provides better voice recognition. GM also said they have redesigned the second-row head restraints to provide better protection in rear impacts.\n\nExterior\nGM says the Yukon Hybrid’s exterior changes versus the gas-powered Yukon are intended to make the SUV more aerodynamic.\n\nA modified bumper drops the regular Yukon’s fog lights for some chunky bodywork and two small portals. The grille has horizontal slats instead of the previous single-piece design. The SUV also includes lower side cladding. Exterior features include:\n\n\n18-inch wheels standard\n22-inch wheels on Denali\nAssist steps\nHeated power mirrors (auto-dimming on driver’s side)\nLow-rolling-resistance tires to reduce road noise\n\nInterior\nThe fully equipped Denali adds luxurious features to the hybrid model, including 12-way power-adjustable cooled leather front seats (Denali and base models both have heated seats).Optional items include a sunroof, a rear DVD player and a blind spot warning system. Three rows of seats are standard, with seating for eight. Along with the hybrid’s higher price, many luxury amenities are standard.\n\nStandard interior features include:\n\n\nAutomatic climate control, tri-zone air conditioning\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nLeather seats\nBose audio system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon Hybrid uses a two-mode hybrid system. The system augments the SUV’s V-8 engine with two electric motors, both powered by a 300-volt battery pack. One of the motors operates the Yukon Hybrid in city driving, and the other works for highway cruising. A cylinder-deactivation system cuts power to four of the eight cylinders during low-stress situations, such as downhill coasting, and braking friction is used to recharge the battery.\n\nGM says the Yukon Hybrid achieves 50 percent better gas mileage than the conventional Yukon. The Yukon Hybrid manages up to 21 mpg in city driving. When properly equipped, the rear-wheel-drive Yukon Hybrid will tow 6,200 pounds.\n\nPowertrain features include:\n\n\n332-horspower, 6.0-liter V-8 with cylinder deactivation, generating 367 pounds-feet of torque\nTwo-mode continuous electric ratio hybrid transmission with four fixed gears\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nElectrically driven variable-assist power steering\nAdditional engine-intake induction tuning reduces interior noise\nElectrically driven air conditioning cools cabin even with the engine off\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nDual-stage front airbags with passenger-sensing system\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability control with traction control",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2009 about the 2009 GMC Yukon Hybrid. Limited reliability data have since emerged, rendering a predicted reliability score of Average from Consumer Reports for a new Yukon Hybrid. To see other changes for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere I was, throwing a laptop bag into my GMC Yukon Hybrid test car, when a guy pulled up next to me. He lowered his window and peevishly hollered: “Why don’t you invest in some hybrid technology that actually gets you better gas mileage, huh, buddy?” (Yep: “some hybrid technology.” I’m not making this up.)\n\nWe might have had quite an instructive debate had the traffic light not changed, but he drove home an important point: The Yukon Hybrid has an image problem. It’s a rolling billboard of hybridness, complete with aerodynamic bumper extensions and absurd decals. Yet its overall EPA mileage ratings are just 20 to 21 mpg — hardly the figures Prius & Co. have conditioned consumers to expect.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that the Yukon is a full-size SUV with big-league towing capabilities, ample power and seating for eight. The fact, buddy, is that the Yukon Hybrid does get better mileage — some 25 percent better than the non-hybrid Yukon overall, and up to 50 percent better in city driving. That’s nothing to scoff at, especially considering how few compromises it requires. Presuming you really need the capabilities of a full-size SUV, the Yukon Hybrid deserves a look. I only wish it weren’t so expensive.\n\nIntroduced for the 2008 model year, the Yukon Hybrid comes in two- or four-wheel drive; little has changed this year, but you can compare the 2009 model with the 2008 one here. This review focuses on elements specific to the hybrid. For details on the Yukon lineup overall, check out our coverage of it here. The extended-length Yukon XL, which doesn’t come as a hybrid, is covered separately.\n\nSmooth Operator\nAs hybrids go, the Yukon Hybrid and its GM siblings — the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid — are impressive. There’s lusty V-8 thrust when you need it, and the transition between electric and gas power is almost seamless. The regenerative brakes impart a more linear, less bricklike feel than in many hybrids. Last year, Cars.com editors drove the ’08 Yukon Hybrid back-to-back with a Ford Escape Hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius (all 2008s) as part of a hybrid mileage challenge, and we readily agreed: The Yukon Hybrid felt the most refined.\n\nOf course, that’s not to say its hybrid workings are invisible. The brake pedal still feels stiffer than a normal car’s, and if you need to accelerate quickly from a stop — say, a left turn with oncoming traffic — there can be a moment’s delay as the drivetrain first tries electric power, then kicks in with the engine. That’s to be expected in a hybrid, and the lag isn’t excessive; Chrysler’s now-retired Aspen Hybrid lagged so much I found myself devising ways to keep the engine from shutting off.\n\nBeyond that, the Yukon Hybrid operates much like a regular Yukon, and that’s a good thing. Its 18-inch wheels create little road noise, and wind noise is also low. Ride quality, a strong suit for GM’s full-size SUVs, is equally impressive. Bumpy roads rarely intrude on cabin comfort, though they can create a moment or two of vague steering response. On the highway, the wheel has a more secure, well-weighted feel. Naturally, the Yukon Hybrid is no athlete: Take a turn aggressively, and there’s plenty of body roll.\n\nMaximum towing capacity is 6,200 pounds — that’s big-league capability and impressive for a hybrid. The non-hybrid Yukon tows up to 8,500 pounds.\n\nThe Inside\nBrowse the photos to see the Yukon Hybrid’s unique displays; suffice to say they give you an idea of where the power is going — among the electric motors, engine and battery — and how efficiently you’re driving. Beyond that, the Yukon Hybrid looks like its non-hybrid siblings. Cabin materials are well-fitted and generally attractive, and the navigation system that comes standard with the Yukon Hybrid is immediately intuitive. It’s a $2,500 option on non-hybrid Yukons.\n\nLeather seats are standard, and the front two rows offer enough room for adults to stretch out. The third row is too cramped for anyone but kids; if you need an adult-friendly third row, the Ford Expedition’s is more generous.\n\nThough the Yukon hasn’t been crash-tested, it offers the expected safety features for a modern SUV, including three-row curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list. Reliability data for the Yukon Hybrid is still pending, but Consumer Reports surveys for the non-hybrid Yukon have returned average scores.\n\nWorth the Money?\nBeing a so-called “full” hybrid capable of low-speed electric cruising, the Yukon Hybrid sees its highest mileage gains in city driving. Highway gains, in comparison, are slight. Here’s the rub: The SUV starts at $50,920, minus a $2,200 hybrid credit that you can claim on your taxes. That’s $465 more than an identically equipped Tahoe Hybrid.\n\nEPA Gas Mileage Compared\n \tBase price\tCity mpg\tHighway mpg\tCombined mpg\nGMC Yukon Hybrid (6.0L V-8)\t$48,720*\t20-21\t20-22\t20-21\nGMC Yukon (4.8L V-8)\t$37,705\t14\t19\t16\nGMC Yukon (5.3L V-8)\t$39,970\t14-15\t20-21\t16-17\nGMC Yukon (6.2L V-8)\t$50,135\t12\t19\t14-15\nFord Expedition (5.4L V-8)**\t$34,150\t14\t20\t16\nNissan Armada (5.6L V-8)\t$37,210\t12\t18\t14\nToyota Sequoia (5.7L V-8)\t$35,275\t13-14\t18-19\t15\n*After $2,200 tax credit.\n**Expedition mileage ratings for 2WD only; 4WD version is exempt from EPA tests due to its higher weight.\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2009 models, except 2008 Toyota Sequoia. Mileage ranges due to driveline variations (2WD, 4WD, etc.). Note that the 6.2-liter Yukon recommends premium fuel, but it can run on regular. All other engines listed, including competitors’, recommend regular.\n\nIf the bottom line is your top priority, get a base Yukon — or, better yet, get the less-expensive Tahoe — with either the 4.8-liter or 5.3-liter V-8. The initial savings far outweigh either engine’s lower gas mileage. (Conversely, if luxury features are more important to you, the 403-horsepower, 6.2-liter Yukon Denali is the best-equipped option.)\n\nIn an apples-to-apples comparison, loading up a 5.3-liter Yukon — whose 310-hp V-8 provides something closer to the hybrid’s 6.0-liter gas/electric output — with features similar to the well-equipped Yukon Hybrid’s puts its cost around $45,645 with two-wheel drive. That’s about $3,000 less than the hybrid.\n\nFactor in your potential savings at the pump — using the EPA’s combined mileage rating for both SUVs, $2 per gallon gas and the assumption you’ll drive 15,000 miles a year — and it would take seven to nine years to recover that $3,000, depending on whether you’re comparing two- or four-wheel drive. If you drive mostly city miles, the Yukon Hybrid makes more sense: You’d likely recover the difference in a reasonable four to five years. With highway miles, it makes the least: Recovering the difference could take decades, if it ever happened at all. Dramatically higher gas prices, of course, would help the Yukon Hybrid’s case — but as gas prices rise, generally so do dealer asking prices for hybrids.\n\nYukon Hybrid in the Market\nHybrid or not, the fact that the Yukon comes from a company that says it’s at bankruptcy’s doorstep can’t help its case. The Yukon Hybrid, however, is not one of the products that brought the General to Waterloo. Quite the contrary; it’s evidence that when GM invests in product development, it can build first-rate fuel-efficient cars and trucks. The Yukon Hybrid may not be the right vehicle for many shoppers, but it’s a compelling choice for a few. As underwhelming as 20 mpg sounds, it’s a rather dramatic percentage increase for SUV owners who rack up miles in stop-and-go commutes and weekend errands. Need three rows of seats and occasional trailer-hauling capacity, too? The Yukon Hybrid ought to make your short list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThough gas mileage ratings for GM’s full-size SUVs are impressive among their competitive set, they aren’t likely to bring smiles to anyone at the pump; their combined ratings still linger in the teens. The Yukon Hybrid changes that, to a degree. Along with its twin, the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid, the Yukon Hybrid promises an improvement in overall gas mileage. The Yukon Hybrid is only available with a short wheelbase, but it comes with either rear- or four-wheel drive. It seats eight.\nNew for 2013\nThe Yukon Hybrid sees no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nGM says the Yukon Hybrid’s exterior changes are intended to make the SUV more aerodynamic compared with the gas-powered Yukon.\n\nA modified bumper drops the regular Yukon’s fog lights for some chunky bodywork and two small portals. There are horizontal grille slats and lower side cladding. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nDenali has 22-inch wheels\nAssist steps\nHeated power mirrors (auto-dimming on driver’s side)\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon Hybrid has room for up to eight people in three rows of seats. Leather upholstery is standard, and the front seats are fitted with seat heaters. Optional items include a sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system. All Yukon Hybrids include an efficiency gauge that gives feedback on your driving style. Standard interior features include:\n\n\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nBose stereo\nNavigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon Hybrid uses a two-mode hybrid system. The system augments the SUV’s V-8 engine with two electric motors, both powered by a 300-volt battery pack. A cylinder-deactivation system cuts power to four of the eight cylinders during low-load situations, such as downhill coasting, and regenerative braking is used to recharge the battery. When properly equipped, the rear-wheel-drive Yukon Hybrid can tow 6,200 pounds, and the four-wheel-drive version can tow 5,900 pounds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n332-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with cylinder deactivation that generates 367 pounds-feet of torque\nTwo-mode continuous electric ratio hybrid transmission with four fixed gears\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nElectrically driven power steering\nElectrically driven air conditioning cools cabin even with the engine off\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with roll-mitigation technology\nRear parking sensors \nBackup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThough gas mileage ratings for GM’s full-size SUVs are impressive among their competitive set, they aren’t likely to bring smiles to anyone at the pump; their combined ratings still linger in the teens. The Yukon Hybrid changes that, to a degree. Along with its twin, the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid, the Yukon Hybrid promises an improvement in overall gas mileage. The Yukon Hybrid is only available with a short wheelbase, but it comes with either rear- or four-wheel drive. It seats eight.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Yukon Hybrid gets a revised touch-screen navigation radio that includes a USB port and the ability to record broadcast audio.\n\nExterior\nGM says the Yukon Hybrid’s exterior changes are intended to make the SUV more aerodynamic compared with the gas-powered Yukon.\n\nA modified bumper drops the regular Yukon’s fog lights for some chunky bodywork and two small portals. There are horizontal grille slats and lower side cladding. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nDenali has 22-inch wheels\nAssist steps\nHeated power mirrors (auto-dimming on driver’s side)\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon Hybrid has room for up to eight people in three rows of seats. Leather upholstery is standard, and the front seats are fitted with seat heaters. Optional items include a sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system. All Yukon Hybrids include an efficiency gauge that gives feedback on your driving style. Standard interior features include:\n\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nBose stereo\nNavigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon Hybrid uses a two-mode hybrid system. The system augments the SUV’s V-8 engine with two electric motors, both powered by a 300-volt battery pack. A cylinder-deactivation system cuts power to four of the eight cylinders during low-stress situations, such as downhill coasting, and regenerative braking is used to recharge the battery. When properly equipped, the rear-wheel-drive Yukon Hybrid can tow 6,200 pounds, and the four-wheel-drive version can tow 6,000 pounds. Mechanical features include:\n\n332-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with cylinder deactivation that generates 367 pounds-feet of torque\nTwo-mode continuous electric ratio hybrid transmission with four fixed gears\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nElectrically driven power steering\nElectrically driven air conditioning cools cabin even with the engine off\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with roll-mitigation technology\nRear parking sensors\nBackup camera",

      "expert_review": "There I was, throwing a laptop bag into my GMC Yukon Hybrid test car, when a guy pulled up next to me. He lowered his window and peevishly hollered: “Why don’t you invest in some hybrid technology that actually gets you better gas mileage, huh, buddy?” (Yep: “some hybrid technology.” I’m not making this up.)\n\nWe might have had quite an instructive debate had the traffic light not changed, but he drove home an important point: The Yukon Hybrid has an image problem. It’s a rolling billboard of hybridness, complete with aerodynamic bumper extensions and absurd decals. Yet its overall EPA mileage ratings are just 20 to 21 mpg — hardly the figures Prius & Co. have conditioned consumers to expect.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that the Yukon is a full-size SUV with big-league towing capabilities, ample power and seating for eight. The fact, buddy, is that the Yukon Hybrid does get better mileage — some 25 percent better than the non-hybrid Yukon overall, and up to 50 percent better in city driving. That’s nothing to scoff at, especially considering how few compromises it requires. Presuming you really need the capabilities of a full-size SUV, the Yukon Hybrid deserves a look. I only wish it weren’t so expensive.\n\nIntroduced for the 2008 model year, the Yukon Hybrid comes in two- or four-wheel drive; little has changed this year, but you can compare the 2009 model with the 2008 one here. This review focuses on elements specific to the hybrid. For details on the Yukon lineup overall, check out our coverage of it here. The extended-length Yukon XL, which doesn’t come as a hybrid, is covered separately.\n\nSmooth Operator\nAs hybrids go, the Yukon Hybrid and its GMC siblings — the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid — are impressive. There’s lusty V-8 thrust when you need it, and the transition between electric and gas power is almost seamless. The GMC hybrid skips the conventional automatic transmission, and opts instead for a CVT. The regenerative brakes impart a more linear, less bricklike feel than in many hybrids. Last year, Cars.com editors drove the ’08 GMC Yukon Hybrid back-to-back with a Ford Escape Hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius (all 2008s) as part of a hybrid mileage challenge, and we readily agreed: The Yukon Hybrid felt the most refined.\n\nOf course, that’s not to say its hybrid workings are invisible. The brake pedal still feels stiffer than a normal car’s, and if you need to accelerate quickly from a stop — say, a left turn with oncoming traffic — there can be a moment’s delay as the drivetrain first tries electric power, then kicks in with the engine. That’s to be expected in a hybrid system, and the lag isn’t excessive; Chrysler’s now-retired Aspen Hybrid lagged so much I found myself devising ways to keep the engine from shutting off.\n\nBeyond that, the Yukon Hybrid operates much like a regular Yukon, and that’s a good thing. Its 18-inch wheels create little road noise, and wind noise is also low. Ride quality, a strong suit for GMC’s full-size SUVs, is equally impressive. Bumpy roads rarely intrude on cabin comfort, though they can create a moment or two of vague steering response. On the highway, the wheel has a more secure, well-weighted feel. Naturally, the Yukon Hybrid is no athlete: Take a turn aggressively, and there’s plenty of body roll.\n\nMaximum towing capacity is 6,200 pounds — that’s big-league capability and impressive for a hybrid. The non-hybrid Yukon tows up to 8,500 pounds.\n\nThe Inside\nBrowse the photos to see the GMC Yukon Hybrid’s unique displays; suffice to say they give you an idea of where the power is going — among the electric motors, engine and battery — and how efficiently you’re driving. Beyond that, the Yukon Hybrid looks like its non-hybrid siblings. Cabin materials are well-fitted and generally attractive, and the navigation system that comes standard with the Yukon Hybrid is immediately intuitive. It’s a $2,500 option on non-hybrid Yukons.\n\nLeather seats are standard, and the front two rows offer enough room for adults to stretch out. The third row is too cramped for anyone but kids; if you need an adult-friendly third row, the Ford Expedition’s is more generous.\n\nThough the Yukon hasn’t been crash-tested, it offers the expected safety features for a modern SUV, including three-row curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list. Reliability data for the Yukon Hybrid is still pending, but Consumer Reports surveys for the non-hybrid Yukon have returned average scores.\n\nWorth the Money?\nBeing a so-called “full” hybrid capable of low-speed electric cruising, the Yukon Hybrid sees its highest mileage gains in city driving. Highway gains, in comparison, are slight. Here’s the rub: The SUV starts at $50,920, minus a $2,200 hybrid credit that you can claim on your taxes. That’s $465 more than an identically equipped Tahoe Hybrid.\n\nEPA Gas Mileage Compared\n \tBase price\tCity mpg\tHighway mpg\tCombined mpg\nGMC Yukon Hybrid (6.0L V-8)\t$48,720*\t20-21\t20-22\t20-21\nGMC Yukon (4.8L V-8)\t$37,705\t14\t19\t16\nGMC Yukon (5.3L V-8)\t$39,970\t14-15\t20-21\t16-17\nGMC Yukon (6.2L V-8)\t$50,135\t12\t19\t14-15\nFord Expedition (5.4L V-8)**\t$34,150\t14\t20\t16\nNissan Armada (5.6L V-8)\t$37,210\t12\t18\t14\nToyota Sequoia (5.7L V-8)\t$35,275\t13-14\t18-19\t15\n*After $2,200 tax credit.\n**Expedition mileage ratings for 2WD only; 4WD version is exempt from EPA tests due to its higher weight.\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2009 models, except 2008 Toyota Sequoia. Mileage ranges due to driveline variations (2WD, 4WD, etc.). Note that the 6.2-liter Yukon recommends premium fuel, but it can run on regular. All other engines listed, including competitors’, recommend regular.\n\nIf the bottom line is your top priority, get a base Yukon — or, better yet, get the less-expensive Tahoe — with either the 4.8-liter or 5.3-liter V-8. The initial savings far outweigh either engine’s lower gas mileage. (Conversely, if luxury features are more important to you, the 403-horsepower, 6.2-liter Yukon Denali is the best-equipped option.)\n\nIn an apples-to-apples comparison, loading up a 5.3-liter Yukon — whose 310-hp V-8 provides something closer to the hybrid’s 6.0-liter gas/electric output — with features similar to the well-equipped Yukon Hybrid’s puts its cost around $45,645 with two-wheel drive. That’s about $3,000 less than the hybrid.\n\nFactor in your potential savings at the pump — using the EPA’s combined mileage rating for both SUVs, $2 per gallon gas and the assumption you’ll drive 15,000 miles a year — and it would take seven to nine years to recover that $3,000, depending on whether you’re comparing two-wheel-drive or the GMC Yukon Hybrid 4WD. If you drive mostly city miles, the Yukon Hybrid makes more sense: You’d likely recover the difference in a reasonable four to five years. With highway miles, it makes the least: Recovering the difference could take decades, if it ever happened at all. Dramatically higher gas prices, of course, would help the Yukon Hybrid’s case — but as gas prices rise, generally so do dealer asking prices for hybrids.\n\nYukon Hybrid in the Market\nHybrid or not, the fact that the Yukon comes from a company that says it’s at bankruptcy’s doorstep can’t help its case. The Yukon Hybrid, however, is not one of the products that brought the General to Waterloo. Quite the contrary; it’s evidence that when GM invests in product development, it can build first-rate fuel-efficient cars and trucks. The GMC Yukon Hybrid may not be the right vehicle for many shoppers, but it’s a compelling choice for a few. As underwhelming as 20 mpg sounds, it’s a rather dramatic percentage increase for SUV owners who rack up miles in stop-and-go commutes and weekend errands. Need three rows of seats and occasional trailer-hauling capacity, too? The Yukon Hybrid ought to make your short list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
