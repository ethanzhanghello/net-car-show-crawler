      "expert_review": "Let Chevy have its Storm, GMC prefers a Syclone and Typhoon.\n\nSyclone is the take-a-deep-breath-and-hold-on-tight pick `em-up that picks up its 16 treads and lays them down on the pavement faster than you can say 0 to 60.\n\nIt`s the truck that has people talking-especially the nation`s youth- about GMC, the invisible division from General Motors that heretofore had been known as making the same trucks as Chevy.\n\nSyclone got the performance truck conversation going, Typhoon will keep it alive. Odd to mention truck and performance at the same time, but you can thank Syclone for awakening the industry and consumers to the fact that trucks can be as much, if not more, fun than some cars.\n\nWe test-drove the `91 Syclone (spelled that way because Mercury had a Cyclone car) and the `92 Typhoon. Syclone is the performance version of the Sonoma pickup truck and Typhoon the performance version of the compact Jimmy utility vehicle. In case you aren`t that familiar with GMC, the Sonoma is a version of the Chevy S-10 pickup and the Jimmy is a version of the Chevy S-10 Blazer.\n\nBoth feature a host of plastic decorative trim, from special ground effects along the rocker panels to wheel-lip extensions and plastic fascia up front. Syclone adds a black tonneau cover for the bed.\n\nSyclone and Typhoon are not designed to haul bricks, hay or 2×4`s. Rather they haul, make that propel, two humans from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in about 5 seconds in Syclone and under 6 seconds in the larger and 200-pound heavier Typhoon.\n\nThe power comes from a 4.3-liter, turbocharged V-6 with intercooler and a 280 horsepower rating. In each vehicle the V-6 is teamed with a four-speed automatic. The mileage rating for Syclone is 14 m.p.g. city/17 highway; for the Typhoon it`s 15/19. If trucks were subject to the same gas-guzzler tax as cars, Syclone and Typhoon would cost you a couple of months` pay in penalties. A young man stopped us in arestaurant parking lot and asked of the Syclone: “How fast does it go?“ The reply was, “It`s the fastest thing between two gas stations that we`ve ever driven.“\n\nFor `92 GMC offers three versions of the venerable 4.3-liter V-6: the base engine, the base with a turbocharger and what they call an “enchanced“ 4.3 with central port injection. The enhanced 4.3 is optional on the Sonoma, Jimmy and Safari van, and standard on a new Sonoma GT coming soon.\n\nThe Syclone and Typhoon have a trace of typical turbo lag when you press the accelerator, just enough time for you to take a deep breath and hold on, because you probably haven`t experienced raw power like this before. Take a Vette off the line? Sure, and the trailer it rode in on.\n\nWhat makes the Syclone and Typhoon special is you don`t get wheel-spin when you play A.J. or Mario getting away from the light. The tires bite and grab, thanks to the specially designed 16-inch unidirectional treads that app ear as wide as they are tall, and the fact that both offer pavement hugging full-time four-wheel-drive for the traction you need to keep the power under control.\n\nWith no wheel-spin at takeoff, you feel as if you`re propelled by a short-fuse rocket when pressing the pedal to the floor.\n\nSyclone and Typhoon also feature four-wheel antilock brakes as standard, since neither has room for a parachute. An air bag, however, is absent. You probably won`t find a driver-side air bag as standard in either vehicle until the fall of `94.\n\nTo better handle the power, Syclone and Typhoon stand several inches lower to the ground than the Sonoma or Jimmy. Ground clearance is a sports car-like 7.1 inches. A sign above the rear-view mirror warns that you don`t have the clearance to go off roading, though why and where you`d go off roading in a 280-horsepower truck or utility vehicle is a bit hard to comprehend.\n\nWith the lower stance, GMC also was aiming for eas er, car-like entry and exit as well as reducing th e high center of gravity that can make trucks or utility vehicles a bit wobbly in corners and turns. No call for wobble with 280 horses galloping.\n\nGMC boasts that Syclone and Typhoon have revolutionized the image of the pickup. Quite a boast, but one that both vehicles can back up, and not just with the power under the hood.\n\nSyclone and Typhoon provide ride and handling that we can only hope sister division Chevrolet could someday work into its Corvette. You`d expect a truck or utility vehicle developing 280 horsepower and sitting only 7.1 inches off the ground to feel like a tractor rolling over a newly plowed field, which oftentimes is how the Vette responds to blacktop or concrete underneath its treads.\n\nYet little road harshness came back through the wheel or seat in Syclone or Typhoon. And some sports coupes couldn`t make as sharp a turn without body lean or zip through a tight turn without body sway as the Syclone and Typhoon did. If an analogy can be drawn, GMC is becoming the Pontiac of trucks.\n\nStandard equipment in the Syclone includes power brakes and steering, air conditioning, power windows, power door locks, AM/FM stereo cassette with graphic equalizer, tilt wheel, intermittent wipers, cruise control, lighted visor vanity mirrors, tinted glass, cup holders, gas shocks and a Lexus Trux Cover black rear tonneau cover. For those who waited for the `92 version, or simply couldn`t get their hands on one of the limited-edition `91s, dual remote-power outside mirrors and carpeted floor mats have been added as standard. There`s also four new exterior colors-red, white, blue and teal, each with a gray lower-body molding.\n\nStandard equipment in the Typhoon includes the same items as the Syclone except it adds electronic rear-load leveling, remote keyless entry and auxiliary center-console power outlets.\n\nBase price of the Syclone was $25,500 for `91 but moves up to $26,995 for 1992. Base price of the Typhoon is $28,995. Our test vehicle added two options, a compact disc player for $134 and a roof-mounted luggage carrier for $126.\n\nGMC produced and sold 2,000 Syclones in the 1991 model year and will build a maximum of 3,500 in 1992. It plans to build a maximum of 5,000 Typhoons in 1992.\n\nOdd that two vehicles named after natural disasters can bring such a breath of fresh air to the world of trucks and utility vehicles. Maybe Syclone and Typhoon will spur development of a Hurricane.",

      "expert_review": "Throughout the last quarter-century, General Motors has built some unique high-performance machinery.\n\nFrom the late ’60s and early ’70s there were the mighty Buick GSX, the Pontiac GTO Judge, the ZL-1 Corvette and the Oldsmobile 442 with the W-31 engine option.\n\nMore recently, Buick built the GNX sports coupe in 1987. And in 1989 Pontiac offered a special turbocharged Pontiac Trans Am 20thanniversary edition.\n\nThese days you’ll pay a small fortune for one of those vehicles – if you can find one.\n\nBut if you prefer something new that is brutally fast, extremely rare and has a good shot at becoming a classic, take a look at the GMC Typhoon.\n\nPress the accelerator and the Typhoon will unleash a gale-force dose of power that will blow you away.\n\nThe Typhoon is a wild, bodacious two-door sport-utility vehicle that feels like it could give a 747 jetliner a good run for the money.\n\nThere is nothing like the four-wheel drive Typhoon available from any other automaker. Never has been.\n\nWith trucks and sport-utility vehicles all the rage, the Typhoon has a real shot at collector status. Only 4,700 were built in the 1992 and 1993 model years. And GMC says Typhoon won’t be back for 1994.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nI never have driven any six-cylinder vehicle that had this much power.\n\nThe Typhoon is the Dodge Viper of trucks. Its acceleration would best be described as violent and neck-snapping.\n\nIn designing the Typhoon, GMC engineers raided the General Motors parts bins and culled the company’s best high-performance equipment from Oldsmobile, Buick and Chevrolet. They came up with a high-octane muscle truck that can leave every other truck on the planet – and most sports cars – in the dust.\n\nUnder the hood is a 4.3-liter, V-6 engine from Chevy’s S-10 Blazer. Connected to it is the same turbocharger that Buick bolted to the high performance Buick GNX sports coupe. Horsepower is rated at 285 – that’s just 15 ponies shy of what you’ll get in a Corvette. Typhoon’s zero-to-60 mph time is quoted as being ”under 6 seconds.”\n\nThe full-time, all-wheel-drive system ensures maximum traction as the Typhoon thunders up to speed.\n\nThe Typhoon uses the same terrific all-wheel drive system found in the upscale Oldsmobile Bravada sport-utility vehicle and the same computer controlled four speed automatic transmission Chevrolet used in last year’s Corvette.\n\nThe howling, growling exhaust lets others know that they most likely wouldn’t stand a chance in a race from a stoplight.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Typhoon’s road manners are just as impressive as its performance.\n\nFrom the specially designed Firestone Firehawk tires to the high-performance suspension system that makes it lower to the ground, GMC engineers didn’t miss a trick in making the Typhoon the best handling sport-utility vehicle ever built.\n\nFat 16-inch, high-speed-rated tires keep the Typhoon planted firmly on the paveme nt. The independent front suspension system incorporates torsion bars, a stabilizer bar, unequal-length control arms and electronic load-leveling shocks.\n\nThat all translates into a ride that is very firm. Even in the tightest curves, the body didn’t lean much.\n\nThesteering is power-assisted, but it takes a bit of muscle to turn the wheel. However, the Typhoon’s steering is tight. You can turn a circle in just 35.4 feet.\n\nThe Typhoon’s front disc/rear drum brakes are strong, and capable of arresting the vehicle’s speed quickly and without fuss. A computerized anti-lock system is standard on the Typhoon.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nInside, the Typhoon sports a pair of leather-covered bucket seats, a unique instrument package, and the same floor-mounted shifter that is used in the Corvette.\n\nThis is far and away the best interior package I’ve ever seen in a GM truck or sport-utility vehicle. But sadly, with only 4,700 Typhoons built, not many other people are going to see it.\n\nYou couldn’t ask for better seats. They are comfortable, great-looking, and they come with six-way electric adjustments and power lumbar supports.\n\nThe gauge package is fabulous. There’s a full set of stylish analog gauges in dark orange. Even the leather-wrapped steering wheel has been given extra padding.\n\nUnlike the standard-issue GMC Jimmy, on which the Typhoon is based, you can’t tow anything or load it with heavy cargo. When GMC engineers designed the Typhoon’s special suspension system, they improved handling over the standard Jimmy, but sacrificed the vehicle’s ability to pull heavy loads. However, the rear seats fold down, and there’s plenty of room for large, lighter packages.\n\nOur test vehicle came stuffed with just about every power accessory you could want in a vehicle. That’s one reason the price was more than $30,000.\n\nThe bright aqua paint job and special body trim gave the Typhoon an aggressive appearance.\n\nNot many people can afford a vehicle like the Typhoon. It’s more of a toy for the well off than a serious piece of transportation.\n\nBut the Typhoon deserves a parking space in GM’s historical collection of high-performance, limited-production machines.\n\nTruett’s tip: The all-wheel drive GMC Typhoon is in a class by itself. There is no other sport-utility vehicle that can out-hustle it.",

      "expert_review": "Everything that’s been said of the Chevrolet Blazer applies to the GMC Jimmy.\n\nHas to-it’s the same vehicle except that the grille sports big G-M-C letters where Chevy put its bow-tie logo.\n\nJimmy offers the same expanded interior dimensions for increased roominess, the same occupant-friendly suspension to cushion you from road harshness, the same car-like ride and handling that makes you feel as if you’re behind the wheel of a sedan rather than a sport-utility vehicle, the same powerful 4.3-liter, V-6 that allows you to merge with ease or tackle the hills and inclines without a running start.\n\nThere’s also the same availability of push-button four-wheel-drive activation, which we were able to use in a recent snow.\n\nThe button makes for quick change to four-wheel pulling power and about the only difference between two- and four-wheel-drive mode is that you’ll detect a tad more road noise in four-wheel, though the noise level in four-wheel drive in the ’95 is about the same as in two-wheel drive in a ’94, thanks to more sound deadeners and more attention to quiet operation in the redesigned ’95.\n\nIf you opt for a transfer case lever to engage 4WD, a change was made to ease the task. Push a button on the lever and the shift is smooth, not forced and finicky as it was when you had to fight when going from two-wheel-drive to four-wheel-drive high and enlist a sumo wrestler to engage four-wheel-drive low.\n\nThere’s also the same driver-side air bag and four-wheel anti-lock brakes.\n\nOf course, being fraternal twins means you not only share the same joys, but the sorrows, too.\n\nJimmy, like Blazer, lacks a passenger-side air bag, though one is coming because all trucks must offer dual bags by 1998.\n\nAnd you’ll have to suffer the infernal hump in the floor on the passenger side, an accommodation for the catalytic converter. The two-door has one problem the four-doordoesn’t: large forward-slanting side roof pillars that look Pathfinder-like and obstruct the side view.\n\nAlso, though the 4.3-liter is potent, it has a thirst, as the 16 mile-per-gallon city/21 m.p.g. highway rating indicates. We admit that when driving in that recent snowstorm the 16/21 m.p.g. rating probably was the last thing on our mind, but there are about 360 days each year when sidling up to self-serve gets annoying-and expensive.\n\nOne other gripe: Despite a redesign for ’95 that increased Jimmy’s interior dimensions, it passed up the chance to add slightly larger and thicker side bolsters to better hold you in your seat when driving aggressively.\n\nOne other point, which can be a nuisance for shorter folks, is that the outside mounted spare tire carrier in back blocks part of the rear window so you lose some field of vision.\n\nAbout the only other problem is that sport-utility vehicles are a hot commodity-particularly Blazer and Jimmy-and the rule of thumb in the a uto industry is to make money while you can. So the two-door vehicle we tested had a base price of $20,157, and the four-door starts at $22,205. Options on both quickly raise your debt.\n\nThe SLS decor package on the two-door sets you back $3,439 for a host of power goodies, from windows and locks to mirrors, as well as what may be the least-used item on to any vehicle, the roof-mounted luggage carrier.\n\nOn the four-door, the option package is $5,248 for the extra power goodies and the stupid luggage rack, which, in case most people don’t notice, makes it difficult to wash and wax your vehicle and often serves no other useful purpose than to be the source of water marks when you miss with the chamois.\n\nThe only other complaint is personal: a vehicle named Jimmy?\n\nOne word of warning. Jimmy is available in Radar Purple, one very unusual color. You must pause a minute and consider whether you’ll love that hue as much three or four years from now as you do today. However, we admit that when the snowstorm came and all the cars in the lot were buried, Radar Purple stood out like a beacon to help us find our vehicle while others were searching for theirs.\n\n>> 1995 GMC Jimmy 2-door Wheelbase: 100.5 inches Length: 175.1 inches Engine: 4.3-liter, 195-h.p., V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 16 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway Base price: $20,157 Price as tested: $24,541. Add $3,439 for option package that includes SLS decor trim, power windows, power door locks, dual power mirrors, folding rear seat, tilt wheel, speed control, roof-mounted luggage carrier, heavy-duty suspension, all-season 15-inch radial tires, AM/FM stereo with cassette and clock; $375 for power driver’s seat, which includes keyless entry; $210 for heavy-duty trailering package; $159 for outside spare tire carrier; $147 for overhead console. Add$485 for freight. Pluses: Driver-side air bag and ABS standard. Occupant friendly suspension with luxury sedan-like ride and handling. Fairly spacious interior. Ease of push button 4WD. Very powerful V-6. easy to see and use controls. Dual cupholders/coin holders/stowage tray in center console, cupholders/snack tray in the rear compartment. Snow Belt 4WD insurance policy. Minuses: No passenger-side air bag. Passenger side floor hump. Forward slanting and huge side pillars obstruct side view. Mileage sad. Seats could use more side support and wider bolsters. With outside mounted spare, expect to lose some rear visibility. Can’t stand the name. How about lowering the price before consumers make that demand? >>",

      "expert_review": "With snow often flying faster than presidential campaign rhetoric, it’s no surprise that sport utility vehicles (or SUVs for short) are in such demand. \n Of course, they’re also suburbia’s latest automotive fashion statement, just as          wood-paneled station wagons or tail fins once were when there were only three TV networks. \n Since so few of these beasts ever actually go off-road, auto companies have been making them more and more carlike. \n So it’s no surprise that GMC’s Jimmy   feels more like a car than a truck. \n Certainly, you can see that this is a true American vehicle. Not just in character, but in freedom of choice: There are a lot of decisions when it comes to equipping your Jimmy (or it’s corporate sibling, the       Chevrolet Blazer). \n First, chose a two-door or four-door body style. The two-door is sporty, with a shorter wheelbase (100.5 inches) than the sensible citizen four-door (107 inches). Then, chose rear-wheel drive, part-time four-wheel drive, or         full-time four-wheel drive. \n There’s only one engine choice, a 4.3-liter V-6 attached to an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission — but buyers can chose an optional five-speed manual on the two-door. \n Next, choose a          suspension. There are five options: Smooth-ride, Euro-ride, Off-road, Highrider, and Euro-ride/Luxury-ride. \n Finally, choose your equipment level: SL, SLS, SLE or SLT. Needless to say, you can equip this vehicle so many different ways that its         character can vary greatly. \n No matter which iteration you chose, you’ll get a very modern-looking truck. Unlike some trucks that look backward for styling inspiration, GM has gone ahead, neatly rounding off the corners while still keep the beefy      stance demanded in this class. The front end is chromed and aggressive, but the overall look is petite. \n The 4.3-liter V-6 grunts out 190 horsepower at 4400 rpm and 250 pound-feet of torque at a low 2,800 rpm. There’s plenty of power here across a     broad range. There’s some engine roar and it doesn’t sprint from a stop, but if you want a sports car, buy one. This is a truck. \n The same attitude applies to the handling. It’s actually quite good. You won’t want to auto-cross with it, but body lean  is well-controlled, no worse than in many family sedans. \n The ride is better than some GM cars, and quieter too. Yet there’s enough height to avoid running over your neighbor’s poodle. Suspension is independent up front, with rear leaf springs out     back. Trailer towing capacity is 5,500 pounds. Payload capacity is 1,293 pounds on the four-door. The full-time four-wheel-drive means there’s no need to fuss with shifting in and out of four-wheel drive. The part-time system is standard. \n The dash is new, shared with the S-series pickup. It’s convenient, with most controls up high where you can reach them. The climate control is easy to understand and operate; the lights, somewhat less so. There are extra o                                              utlets provided to power small items, and a roof-mounted console with space for glasses, radar detectors and such stuff. Gauges are complete, big and easy to read. The only real complaint is GM’s refusal to abandon its combination windshield               wiper-washer/turn signal/cruise control stalk. For those unfamiliar with it, it’s tacky feel and confusing operation is becoming the butt of jokes. \n The seats were covered in leather of average quality. The rear seats are mounted a little too low, but comfortable enough. They’re split folding affairs, so loading long items like bookcases is as easy as any wagon. The seven-way power driver’s seat was supportive and comfortable for long drives in the Poconos. There is good room for four — five in a      pinch. \n The spare tire is located underneath, so there’s plenty of cargo space. There’s a shade provided to hide valuables in the cargo area, as well as a cargo net. \n Anti-lock brakes are provided — front disc, rear drum. The seat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 belts are height adjustable. Only a driver’s side airbag is available. \n In sum, what we have here is a comfortable, attractive SUV that coddles you with its confident ability to go anywhere. The new look and refinement make this truck one to check out if you’re shopping in this class. Base price on a rear-wheel-drive two-door is $19,573. Adding four-wheel drive bumps that up to $21,456. Our four-door, four-wheel drive had a base price of $23,504. Watch the options and you can have a go-anywhere vehicle for the same price as a well-equipped family car. \n The only thing is, unlike your parents’ station wagon, there’s no wood-grain option for the side. \n Too bad.     \n 1996 GMC JIMMY 4WD 4-DOOR SLT  Standard: 4.3-liter V-6, four-speed         automatic transmission, power steering, four-wheel anti-lock power brakes, air conditioning, AM-FM stereo with clock, smooth-ride suspension, tinted glass, reclining bucket seats, intermittent wipers, folding rear seats.

      "expert_review": "When it comes to the GMC Jimmy compact sport-utility vehicle, the best is yet to come. \n That’s because Jimmy undergoes a styling change for 1998 that will add a long-awaited passenger-side air bag and, after the first of the year, will add a new  model called Envoy, a luxury version of the four-wheel-drive GMC hauler. \n Envoy was previewed at the Chicago Auto Show with the Yukon Denali. Envoy will be the luxury version of the compact Jimmy, Denali the luxury version of the full-size Yukon, as   GMC makes good on its promise to go more upscale and let Chevrolet handle value-for-the-dollar customers. \n The restyled Jimmy will arrive in the fall; Envoy will appear after the first of the year. Denali arrives for the 1999 model year. When Envoy    arrives, GMC plans to carry the Jimmy name only on two-door compact sport-utes. GMC still is debating whether to drop the Yukon name and go with Denali. \n Air bags have been a sore point with Jimmy and its cousin, Chevy Blazer. GM has been very slow,   many consumers say too slow, in bringing the inflatable safety cushions into its compact sport-ute lineup. \n The Ford Explorer has them, the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee have them, even the Jeep Wrangler and Toyota RAV4 subcompact sport-utes have   them. \n For a time, GM was insisting customers didn’t care whether they had two bags as long as they had four-wheel anti-lock brakes, which they considered a far more important safety item than dual bags. Not to downplay the importance of ABS, but if   you were to run into a tree head-on at 45 miles per hour with a passenger aboard, the value of a bag  would become clear. \n We tested the ’97 Jimmy four-door with 4WD that comes with an electronic push-button transfer case as standard. To engage all    four wheels, you simply need to press the button in the dash. No levers to fiddle with. A very nice system. \n Jimmy comes with a 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower V-6, rated at 16 miles per gallon city/21 highway. The power is ample, the city fuel economy a    bit disappointing. Rumors are that Jimmy and Blazer will offer a new V-8 engine for 1998 to increase towing capability and stop Ford from boasting it has a V-8 in Explorer, while GMC and Chevy don’t in Jimmy or Blazer. \n Considering the 5-liter V-8 in  Explorer forces the fuel gauge to move anytime Explorer does, GMC and Chevy should focus on a more fuel-efficient V-6–like Ford did in putting a 4.6-liter V-6 in Explorer that has nearly as much power yet even more mileage than the V-8. \n We hope the  ’98 Jimmy also will upgrade its suspension system. “Smooth ride” suspension is standard; our test vehicle came with “luxury ride” suspension. Whatever you call it, it felt a bit stiff at times. GM long has boasted that Jimmy/Blazer feature car-like ride   and handling compared with Explorer’s more truck-like road manners. Not this time. \n If GMC wants to provide more car-like ride and handling, in addition to smo                                                                                             other suspension, it should focus on speed-sensitive power steering for Jimmy that provides quicker response to wheel input. We’ve driven the GMC Yukon and Chevy Suburban with revisions to their steering systems and, though both are much larger and        heavier than Jimmy, both were more nimble and limber and easier to maneuver and park than the compact. \n About the only other gripe with Jimmy is the complaint we’ve had with this vehicle and the Blazer since Day 1: The floor under the front passenger  sports a huge bulge where the catalytic converter rests. It reduces comfort and at times makes it a bit warm for your passenger. It would be nice if the ’98 solved that problem. \n The four-door, 4WD Jimmy we tested starts at $24,362. A hefty $5,399     option package was added that included popular power goodies–door locks, windows and mirrors. The best option was the $695 power sunroof that allows fresh air into the cabin–and lets out some of the heat from the convert er under                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the passenger’s floor. \n Should you wait for the ’98 Jimmy? \n Well, it will have that much-needed second bag, plus the Envoy will offer leather seats and OnStar, the GM satellite communications system that automatically summons help via your         cellular phone if an air bag deploys.    \n  >> 1997 GMC Jimmy 4WD Wheelbase: 107 inches Length: 181.2 inches Engine: 4.3-liter, 190-h.p., V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 16 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway Base price: $24,362 Price as     tested: $30,816. Includes $5,399 for option package 1SL with SLT decor, power windows, power door locks, dual power mirrors, tilt wheel, speed control, roof rack, luxury ride suspension, AM/FM stereo with compact-disc player and clock; power sunroof $695; heavy-duty trailer towing $210; and gold appearance package $150. Add $515 for freight. Pluses: Gold appearance package on cherry red body is very rich looking. Driver-side air bag and four-wheel ABS standard. Electronic transfer case to engage 4WD,       simply push a button. Minuses: No passenger-side air bag until 1998 model year, when vehicle undergoes minor styling change that hopefully will remove the catalytic converter hump under the front passenger floor. Steering a bit stiff, more so than on the  larger Yukon or Tahoe. >>",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJimmy is an upscale version of the midsize SUV that Chevrolet sells as the Blazer and Oldsmobile sells as the Bravada. All three will be redesigned and introduced next spring as early 2002 models.\n\nGMCs current model comes in two- and four-door wagon body styles, but the 2002 will be renamed Envoy and will come only as a four-door.\n\nExterior\nJimmys styling is the same as the Blazers except for a different grille and trim. The four-door model is 184 inches long, about 6 inches shorter than the Ford Explorer and 7 inches longer than the two-door Jimmy.\n\nInterior\nAll models have two front bucket seats. The four-door seats three in back, and the two-door holds two, and the rear seat is split and folds for extra cargo room on both. Cargo volume is 67 cubic feet on the two-door and 74 cubic feet on the larger four-door. The OnStar communication system is a new factory option instead of a dealer-installed accessory. On models with power door locks, the doors can be programmed to lock and/or unlock automatically. An optional molded composite cargo organizer fits into the cargo area floor and provides compartments for carrying groceries, sports gear and tools.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models come with a 190-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6 engine, but there is a choice of transmissions and either two- or four-wheel drive. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on two-door Jimmys. A four-speed automatic is standard on the four-door and optional on the two-door.\n\nTwo 4WD systems are available. Insta-Trac is standard on SLS and SLE 4x4s and is engaged by a dashboard switch. Autotrac is standard on 4WD SLT and Diamond Edition models, and it engages automatically when more traction is needed.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard on all models.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "BRANTFORD, Ontario, Canada — It’s the middle of a cold winter’s night in the birthplace of hockey’s Wayne Gretzky, but I’m not here in search of memorials to the Great One.\n\nI’m looking for doughnuts — Tim Horton doughnuts — and a big, strong cup of coffee.\n\nMy annual pilgrimage to Detroit for the big auto show in January includes a weekend in another not-so-hot spot — Buffalo, N.Y. — where I visit relatives.\n\nThis year, going from Detroit to Buffalo, I foolishly took the southern route from Detroit to Buffalo through Toledo and Cleveland in Ohio and Erie in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the way back to Detroit, I took the more familiar, shorter, and more scenic route through the plains of Ontario.\n\nMy traveling companion this year was a 1998 GMC Jimmy SLE four-door sport-utility. When I fly into Detroit in winter I always drive a four-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive vehicle. The theory is that I’ll get a chance to put these vehicles through a “real world” test with “real world” ice and snow on the “real world” battered roads of the region. This year, the weather was unusually cooperative. It was rainy, but in the 40s in Detroit. And, later in the week, it was single-digit cold in Buffalo and Canada, but there was no precipitation.\n\nSo, four-wheel-drive remained unengaged, and the Jimmy got rated on its own merits, and not how well it did in keeping me out of a ditch.\n\nAfter a week and more than 800 miles behind the wheel of this four-door, I’m more convinced than ever that this — and its sibling, the Chevy Blazer — are solid citizens of the sport-utility world.\n\nAnd it’s decidedly non-trendy, too.\n\nLook at the Mercedes ML320 and the new Lexus RX300. These are sport-utilities that really drive like cars. Or consider the Lincoln Navigator, the chrome-coated behemoth that truly reflects the excesses of today’s sport-utilities.\n\nOr ponder the Honda CR-V or the Toyota RAV4. These mini-utes are adorable.\n\nBut the Jimmy isn’t car-like, or excessive, or cute.\n\nNo, the Jimmy is a sport-utility built for people who need one, not people who want one.\n\nInterior room is good, but not gargantuan. Cargo capacity is more than adequate but less than extraordinary. The 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 engine is functional, but not fast. And the exterior design is squarish rather than cutting-edge.\n\nBut everything works well. And the ride, especially hours long jaunts over pockmarked Midwestern roads, is quite nice. You can still tell that the basis for the Jimmy is the GM’s small pickup platform, but it’s a good match here. At the end of a long night, I emerged tired from the trip, but not tired from the ride.\n\nThe Jimmy has partially cashed in on the SUV boom. Redone and released in 1994, sales have stayed in the 75,000 to 80,000 range in each of the last three years. Easily outsold by its rivals — Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Blazer — but the Jimmy has held solid, wh ile the other three saw goodly drops in sales in 1997 from 1996.\n\nThe Jimmy gets only minor changes for 1998, including a slightly different front-end treatment, a new instrument panel and some new colors. Most noticeable is the arrival — finally — of a passenger-side air bag and the fact that four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are now standard on all models.\n\nSold in two- or four-wheel-drive, in two- or four-door configuration and in four trim levels (only two in two-door models), the Jimmy caters to a wide swatch of the sport-utility-buying population. You can get a spare, manual-transmission, two-wheel-drive, two-door Jimmy for as cheap as $22,000 or a fully loaded four-wheel-drive, four-door version with options like a power sunroof and trip computer for $31,000-plus.\n\nStill, even when this vehicle is equipped with a lot of luxuries, it doesn’t pretend to be a Jaguar or BMW. No, it’s simply a nicely dressed truck.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks for pot ential Jimmy buyers is that you can’t get a V-8 engine or full-time four-wheel-drive. Those features are found on some competitive models.\n\nAlso, the four-door Jimmy’s smaller, 18-gallon fuel tank meant a shorter driving range than on some other mid-size sport utilities.\n\nNUTS AND BOLTS\n\nWhat we drove: 1998 GMC Jimmy SLE, a four-door, four-wheel-drive sport-utility with a 4.3-liter V-6 engine and an automatic transmission.\n\nBase price: $25,855\n\nPrice as tested (includes options, delivery charge and discounts): $28,921\n\nTowing capacity: 5,000 pounds\n\nLength: 183.8 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,683 pounds\n\nGround clearance: 7.5 inches\n\nTurning circle (curb to curb): 39.5 feet\n\nStandard features: Electronic four-wheel-drive transfer case; dual air bags; four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes; daytime running lamps; air conditioning; tilt steering; cruise control; AM/FM stereo with cassette; deep-tint solar glass; rear split folding bench seat; cloth interior.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Marketing option package with overhead console, heated outside mirrors, power driver’s seat, luxury ride suspension and AM/FM stereo with CD player; two-tone paint.\n\nEPA figures: 16 mpg (city); 20 mpg (highway)",
