      "expert_review": "The basic nature of sport-utility vehicles has changed.\n\nAs few as 10 years ago, most sport-utility vehicles were Spartan machines, offering little in the way of optional luxury features, and they had rides so stiff that driving over rough terrain would bruise your kidneys.\n\nNowadays many sport-utilities have been dolled up with numerous luxury items, such as plush leather seats, electric sunroofs, CD players and a full menu of power accessories.\n\nSome ”off-road” vehicles now even ride as comfortably as cars.\n\nAnd why not make sport-utilities more carlike?\n\nAutomakers have discovered that few owners of sport-utility vehicles actually ever venture into the woods or anywhere else off the road.\n\nBut the GMC division of General Motors, which builds only trucks and sport-utility vehicles, offers a vehicle that can handle the best – and worst – of both worlds.\n\nThe GMC Yukon SLE is easy to drive, rugged and powerful as well as luxurious and comfortable.\n\nIt proved to bean enormously pleasing vehicle to drive in all situations. The Yukon glided quietly and easily over rain-soaked streets; through thick sand; down bumpy, pothole-ridden dirt roads; on long highways and in stop-and-go city traffic.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOur test vehicle came with a quiet but very muscular 5.7-liter, fuel-injected V-8 and a computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOtherdrivetrain options are available; 1994 models can be ordered with a turbocharged 6.5-liter diesel engine and an automatic, or you can choose a five-speed manual for the gas engine.\n\nAll Yukons, however, come with a shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive system. That means you never have to get out of the Yukon and manually lock the front hubs to engage the all-wheel drive system, according to GMC.\n\nMost of the 450-mile test drive took place on the road and with power going only to the rear wheels.\n\nIn the city, the big V-8 gives the Yukon excellent all-round performance. Even though the Yukon is a big vehicle – it weighs 4,710 pounds – it accelerates briskly from a stop.\n\nIf you floor the accelerator, the transmission’s usually smooth shifts will become harsh. In fact, the shift from second to third gear makes the vehicle shudder slightly under full acceleration.\n\nTo engage four-wheel drive, all you do is move a floor-mounted shift lever that is in front of the storage console. A diagram in the shift lever’s housing lights up, showing you that the transfer case is sending power to all four wheels.\n\nI like the demeanor of the Yukon when you shift into four-wheel drive and make it work hard, such as when you’re climbing a steep, sandy hill. The engine remains smooth and quiet, but you can hear it working. It’s a sound that inspires confidence. Though you might not take it off-road, it occurred to me that the four-wheel-drive system would be excellent to use when trailering a boat out of the water on slippery boat ramp.\n\nFuel mileage can vary greatly. If you drive with a heavy foot and use the four-wheel-drive system, the V-8 will gulp gasoline at the rate of 12 miles per gallon. However, if you drive easily in two-wheel drive, you can get close to 19 mpg on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nOne of the nice things about the Yukon is that you needn’t bother slowing down for speed bumps, and if you hit the occasional pothole, well, it’s no big deal. The heavy duty suspension can handle it. One of the advantages of driving a serious sport-utility vehicle is that it is designed to handle a fair amount of abuse.\n\nThe Yukon’s suspension system is stiff by car standards, but the ride is not harsh – unless you encounter very rough terrain. Then you will experience considerable bouncing, but no more so than you feel in any sport-utility vehicle other than a Range Rover, which handles that kind of terrain like a Rolls-Royce would a smooth road.\n\nGenerally, the Yukon’s suspension system does a good job erasing bumps. Unlike other four-wheel drive sport-utilities vehicles, the Yukon has an independent front suspension.\n\nThis setup allows the front wheels to react individually to road conditions. Yukon uses a standard solid rear axle. Heavy-duty shocks are standard on all four corners.\n\nOff the road, the Yukon’s comfortable seats make driving in rough terrain nothing short of fun. You find that you don’t worry about what the vehicle can do. Instead, you concentrate on where you want to go.\n\nOn the road, the Yukon’s ride is smooth and quiet.\n\nThe power-assisted steering does not require a lot of effort; the wheel turns easily, but the response is not really sharp. The 41.5-foot turning radius is excellent for a vehicle the size of the Yukon.\n\nThe anti-lock brakes are nothing short of terrific. Big discs up front and drums on the rear bring the Yukon to a quick, panic-free stop. Even under severe braking, the Yukon’s body stays straight, the front does not dip and the vehicle remains easy to control.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Yukon SLE is a quality machine.\n\nAlthough it carries what seems like a high admission price, you get a lot of vehicle for your money.\n\nOur test vehicle sported a full array of power accessories, including a six-way electrically adjustable driver’s bucket seat. The passenger’s bucket seat is manually adjustable.\n\nI knew I would like the Yukon the minute I pulled into heavy traffic.\n\nIn fact, it’s in the city where the full-size Yukon seems best. In a long line of traffic, you easily can see what’s going on far ahead because you sit high above most other vehicles. That’s a wonderful advantage in traffic-choked Central Florida. Several times, I looked ahead on Interstate 4 and took the nearest exit in order to avoid a jam.\n\nVisibility is excellent, thanks in part to two huge door-mounted mirrors and an unobstructed view out the rear.\n\nAs with other full-size GM trucks, some of the Yukon’s interior appointments could stand a little tweaking.\n\nTo operate some of the dash-mounted accessories, such as the cassette deck or air conditioner, you must lean forward because they are more than an arm’s length away.\n\nThe rear seats fold forward, leaving you with a big flat area that allows you to carry a staggering amount of cargo.\n\nGMC does a great job of assembling the Yukon. The paint is as smooth as wet glass. There were no rattles or squeaks or any flaws that I could find.\n\nOverall, the Yukon is a tough, well-built and civilized sport-utility vehicle.\n\nTruett’s tip: The GMC Yukon SLE is a vehicle that can do it all. Yukon’s big V-8 packs plenty of power, and the suspension system can handle rugged terrain. But city slickers also will find the Yukon tame, comfortable and easy to drive.",

      "expert_review": "If they were around today, Max and Morris Grabowski – founders of what later became the GMC division of General Motors – would probably be proud to see where their old company is headed.\n\nPart of the latest reorganization at General Motors calls for each of the giant automaker’s divisions to carve out a unique identity and image for itself in the market.\n\nThe GMC division is in the process of being merged with Pontiac. Once all the dust settles, the division will cater to well-to-do buyers looking for upscale trucks and sport-utilities.\n\nGMC’s vehicles generally will be better equipped and offer more luxury features than similar models sold by Chevrolet.\n\nThis week’s test vehicle, a bright-red $34,000 Yukon with leather seats and a full load of luxury items, is proof that that process already is well under way.\n\nOur Yukon was an expensive vehicle; it came with nearly every item available.\n\nI wouldn’t call the V-8-powered Yukon a real alternative to the $50,000 British-built Range Rover luxury sport-utility, but it is a classy vehicle in its own right. And given the Yukon’s generous level of equipment and its powerful engine, it looks like a bargain when compared with fully loaded imports such as the Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Acura SLX and Isuzu Trooper – none of which offers a V-8 engine.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nGMC engineers went to work on the Yukon’s V-8 engine and delivered a motor for 1996 that offers higher performance and lower maintenance.\n\nGMC rates the Yukon’s 5.7-liter Vortec V-8 at 250-horsepower – 50 more than last year. Surprisingly, the big boost in horsepower does not come at the expense of fuel economy.\n\nThe big V-8 sports a new fuel-injection system that precisely measures and delivers fuel to each cylinder through small tubes in the intake manifold. GM calls the setup ”sequential central port fuel injection.” I call it fabulous.\n\nAt 4,731 pounds, the Yukon might have been a real beast had it been underpowered. But the smooth-running Vortec V-8 is very lively at low speeds and provides ample power for all driving situations. In fact, the Yukon does not feel as if it weighs more than 2 tons.\n\nAlso, the Yukon’s engine should require little regular maintenance other than oil and filter changes. Its spark plugs, spark wires and radiator coolant are designed to last 100,000 miles.\n\nThe Yukon is available with a manual transmission, but it is likely that few will be sold.\n\nThe Yukon got 15 mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway. A turbocharged diesel engine, which is a bit more fuel efficient, also is available.\n\nOur test vehicle’s four-speed automatic and four-wheel-drive setup made the big sport-utility very easy to drive. The power-assisted steering system feels firm and positive, but not too heavy. The front disc/rear drum brakes bite quickly when you step on the pedal. However, the anti-lock system seems a bit eager to engage when braking hard on slippery surfaces.\n\nThe Yukon rides on 16-inch tires. Its ride is generally smooth and quiet, on the road and off. The suspension system is fairly firm and it manages harsh terrain well. You can drive the Yukon aggressively on bumpy roads with confidence. The body dips gently as the suspension system absorbs the larger bumps. Buttons on the dash control the four-wheel drive system.\n\nI liked the Yukon best on the highway. It isn’t bothered by crosswinds, and you sit high enough off the ground to have a commanding view of the road.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur Yukon was bolted together tightly with the exception of a speaker that caused a door panel to vibrate when the radio was turned up.\n\nI liked the feel of the materials used in the Yukon’s interior. The plastic trim around the windshield, door panels and dash had a rich, grainy texture and a durable, heavy duty feel.\n\nThe thickly padded front bucket seats were superb. The leather wash avy and soft, and there was plenty of support for the lower back. Fold-down armrests in the inner sections of the seats made for comfortable cruising on the highway. The rear 60-40 split bench seat offered ample foot and leg room for three passengers.\n\nFolding the seats forward exposed a big, flat area that increases the Yukon’s cargo-carrying capacity. I put a pair of full-size bicycles in back and closed the two-piece tailgate with no problem.\n\nThe dash and instruments are not particularly stylish, but they are cleanly designed and easy to read. Rotary knobs in the center of the dash control the air conditioner. The AM/FM radio had both a cassette and a CD player.\n\nVisibility to the front, rear and sides was excellent. That helps instill confidence when you are parking the Yukon or driving it in a confined area. Unlike the gigantic GMC Suburban, you have a good sense of the Yukon’s proportions.\n\nAbout all the Yukon is lacking is a passenger’s air bag, but that will be addressed next year. Even though the fully loaded Yukon has a fairly steep price, buyers have been snapping them up. The Yukon and its sister vehicle, the Chevy Tahoe, have been hot since the day they rolled out of the factory.\n\nTruett’s tip: Quiet, quick, smooth and powerful, the fully equipped GMC Yukon is a high-quality luxury sport-utility vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "SOMETIMES YOU need a tank at the beach — something to intimidate the motorized opposition, to take the road less traveled to that favorite spot by the water, something that can house you when sun and surf turn to wind and rain.\n\nYou need a 1995 four-door, four-wheel-drive, GMC Yukon, also sold as the 1995 Chevrolet Tahoe. The Yukon and Tahoe are big hugga-mugga truck-wagons designed to be a bit more maneuverable than the bigger GMC/Chevrolet Suburbans. General Motors says the Yukon and Tahoe are “right-sized,” which implies that the gargantuan Suburbans are “wrong-sized,” even though the company’s publicists don’t say that.\n\nI’ve fallen in love with the Yukon, which I drove for 1,000 miles or so in sunny and nasty weather, beach and urban traffic, carrying loads of stuff and lots of people. The Yukon does a better job handling those tasks than the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer, Isuzu Trooper and Nissan Pathfinder. For that matter, for urban hauling and beach-type off-road applications, it beats the wheels off the Toyota Land Cruiser and the splendiferous Range Rover 4.0 SE.\n\nNone of that means the Yukon is perfect. When lightly loaded, its rear end bounces like a basketball on lousy roads, such as the pock-marked, rutted and blistered New Jersey Turnpike. But considering its comfort, utility, performance, overall design and price, the Yukon is very nice.\n\nBackground: Let’s face it: GMC/Chevrolet Suburbans are a pain in the butt to operate in the city, which is why GM created the smaller four-door Yukon and Tahoe.\n\nThe Yukon and Tahoe have a 111.5-inch wheelbase — the centerline distance between the front and rear wheels — compared with 131.5-inch wheelbase for the GMC/Chevrolet Suburban models. Overall length is 188.5 inches for the Yukon and Tahoe, compared with 220 inches for the Suburbans. But the Yukon and Tahoe are slightly wider (77.1 inches versus 76.7 for the Suburbans); and they’re 2.2 inches taller(72.4 inches versus 70.2 inches for the Suburbans).\n\nThose differences give the Yukon and Tahoe certain advantages. For example, I could park the tested Yukon on New York City streets without much hassle. But trying to do the same thing with a Chevy Suburban drew derisive laughter and insults (“You stoopid? You stoopid? Get that big thing outta here!”).\n\nAlso, the Suburbans look, well, suburban. But the shorter Yukon and Tahoe look more muscular, more aggressive, which means they have more of an intimidating presence, which comes in handy when some turkey tries to cut you off in beach-bound traffic.\n\nThe Yukon and Tahoe come with two or four doors, and two-wheel or four-wheel-drive. A driver’s air bag is standard, as are power front disc/rear drum brakes with an anti-lock backup system.\n\nA heavy duty, electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission is standard on the four-door Yukons and Tahoes and optional for two-door models.\n\nThe stan dard Yukon/Tahoe engine is a butt-kicking, fuel-sucking 5.7-liter V-8 rated 200 horsepower at 4,000 rpm with maximum torque set at 310 pound-feet at 2,400 rpm.\n\nBoth the Yukon and Tahoe can carry up to six people, and can be outfitted to haul 1,676 pounds of cargo and pull a 7,000-pound trailer. Lordy! We’re talkin’ lotsa muscle!\n\nComplaints: No front-passenger air bag. A bit too much power assistance in steering, which makes steering feel a tad loose. Rear bounciness on bumpy roads when the vehicle is lightly loaded.\n\nPraise: Design and construction, utility, excellent passenger comfort,, very good highway performance, competitively priced.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Drew favorable looks everywhere.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent acceleration, even heavily loaded. Excellent ride and very good handling when loaded. Fair-to-good rear ride and good handling when lightly loaded. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: Ha, ha, ha.. In the tested fo r-door, four-wheel-drive Yukon, about 14 to the gallon (30-gallon tank, estimated 390-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), combined city-highway, off-road (gravel road, sand and grass), running with one to four occupants and 1,300 pounds of cargo.\n\nSound system: Optional six-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with compact disc, by GM/Delco. Excellent.\n\nPrice: Base price for the tested four-door, 4WD, GMC Yukon SLE is $28,585. Dealer invoice on base model is $25,012. Price as tested is $31,861, including $2,626 in options and a $650 destination charge.\n\nThe base and dealer invoice prices on the comparable four-door, 4WD Chevrolet Tahoe LS are identical to those for the Yukon SLE. Destination charge for the Tahoe is $40 less.\n\nPurse-strings note: Excellent value. Compare with the high-line versions of the Nissan Pathfinder, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer. Also compare with the Range Rover 4.0 SE and the Toyota Land Cruiser.",

      "expert_review": "Ten years ago, who would have thought that the luxury car of the 1990s would be a fancy truck?\n\nIncreasingly, that’s true because dolled up sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) from makers such as Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz and soon, BMW and Cadillac, are rapidly replacing luxury sedans in the garages of the affluent.\n\nGMC, positioned as General Motors’ premier truck brand, has launched two luxurious SUVs. The Envoy is based on the compact Jimmy, while the Denali is a full-size Yukon.\n\nDenali, or “the High One” in the language of the native Athabascan people, refers to Alaska’s Mt. McKinley. Denali is clearly the peak of GMC’s product line, and it has been plumped up so thoroughly that Cadillac’s upcoming SUV, the Escalade, is heavily based on it.\n\nBuilt on 117.5-inch wheelbase, the Yukon is shorter than a Suburban and has only two rows of seats, whereas the Suburban is available with a third seat. Except for length, the two vehicles have much in common.\n\nIn city driving the Denali felt big and occasionally cumbersome, but certainly less so than the longer Suburban.\n\nVisually, you can distinguish the Denali from the standard Yukon because it has a large grille, jewel-like headlights, fog lights, recessed tow hooks, chrome wheels and body cladding that accents the wheel wells. The monotone look is sleek and sublte. Our test vehicle’s Meadow Green Metallic paint was vibrant without being gaudy.\n\nInside, yards of leather and Zebrano wood accents set the tone for what the Denali is really about: delivering its occupants in style and comfort, no matter how bad the weather or how rough the road. Heated, 6-way power front seats are standard, and come upholstered in glove-soft two-tone leather, which is detected by your nose as soon as you open the door. Even the outboard sections of the back seat are heated.\n\nElsewhere, goodies abound: Six-speaker Bose stereo with CD player, Homelink transmitter built into the overhead console, power windows, power locks and heated outside mirrors. There are separate controls for rear-sear air conditioning and stereo operation.\n\nFront seats are wide and soft, with inboard armrests. Leather is everywhere, even atop the lid of the center console, and the two-tone color scheme is aesthetically pleasing. There is adequate room for adults in the back seat, and the split-folding seat is a boon for carrying long cargo, such as skis or bikes, while still having room for a third passenger.\n\nGM’s OnStar cellular phone communications system is optional. OnStar uses a cell phone and Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite technology to link the driver with a center where advisors provide real-time help. OnStar also notifies the center automatically in the event of an airbag deployment so emergency help can be summoned to the vehicle’s exact location.\n\nDespite the fact that the Yukon is essentially a truck, it doesn’t ride like one, thanks to special Bilstein shock absorbers and fat Firestone touring tires that are far less noisy than the mud and snow treads found on so many SUVs. Since most folks will never take a Denali on serious off-road trails, these tires are a good pavement compromise. While ride was as plush as most luxury cars, I would trade more ride firmness for less pitch and sway.\n\nPower comes from 5.7-liter V8 that pumps out 255 horsepower, which might seem like a lot except that the Denali has a curb weight of 5,867 pounds. Even still, the Vortec V8 has lots of low- and mid-range muscle, or torque, so it accelerates with reasonable authority, and is capable of towing 6,500 pounds. Use it hard and its gets fairly noisy. Gas mileage is rated at 12 mpg city and 16 highway.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard. AutoTrac keeps the vehicle in two-wheel drive until there is some wheel slippage, at which time four-wheel-drive is automatically activated. This system is especially useful for city use, but precludes serious off-roading.\n\nCo ared to other luxury SUVs, the Denali is right there in size, but it costs somewhat less than its competitors. In light of the upcoming Cadillac Escalade, it just might be the bargain of the luxury SUV crowd.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price for our test vehicle was $42,855. Leather, front and rear air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with CD player, trailering package, power seats, tilt wheel, cruise control, power windows, power locks, heated seats, heated outside mirrors, chrome wheels and limited-slip differential are all standard.\n\nThe sticker price was $43,495 including freight.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Comfort and convenience are a priority throughout, so the leather seats and wood trim are perfect additions.\n\nCounterpoint: Cockpit ergonomics are still not great, and I would sacrifice the soft ride for tighter handling.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.7-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 117.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,867 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $42,855\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $43,495\n\nMPG RATING: 12 city, 16 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Think of GMC’s full-size Yukon sport-utility vehicle (SUV) as a truncated Suburban and you get the picture quickly.\n\nEven though it differs significantly from the Suburban, it looks much the same, and it’s easy to confuse the two at a cursory glance. The Yukon’s wheelbase is 14 inches shorter, and overall length 20 inches less. Its shorter length makes it more maneuverable than the Suburban, and it fits into a regular garage easier. Most of the space is taken from aft of the back seat. While the Suburban can carry eight people, the Yukon is limited to six.\n\nThe Yukon, and its clone from Chevrolet, the Tahoe, started the current rush to full-size SUVs and caused Ford to develop the Expedition, which has become a serious challenger. For this year the Yukon gets a passenger-side airbag, speed-sensitive power steering and a tighter turning radius.\n\nWhile there are both two-door and four-door models, the bulk of sales will like our test vehicle, a four-door with four-wheel drive.\n\nWhile the Yukon may be shorter than the Suburban, it is still a big vehicle that feels bulky. As I wheeled into a parking garage I instinctively ducked my head because I was sitting so close to the ceiling. Negotiating the tight twists and turns was tedious, but got easier when I realized that it fit just fine. The revised front suspension lets it turn somewhat sharper, but its girth can still be intimidating in such environments.\n\nBut size sells, and that is part of the Yukon’s allure. As GMC’s press kit puts it, this vehicle is for “people who want to comfortably dominate the roads they travel.” Plus, the 7,000-pound towing capacity of the two-wheel-drive model makes it ideal for pulling heavy boats or big campers. Even the four-wheel-drive model can pull 6,500 pounds.\n\nEngaging four-wheel drive is done with a button on the dash.\n\nBefitting its size, power is prodigious, as well. The 5.7-liter, Vortec V8 pumps out 255 horsepower, enough to give it serious pulling power and strong acceleration. Coupled to a four-speed automatic transmission, it drives as effortlessly as a luxury sedan, and luxury is a great deal of its appeal.\n\nA 6.5-liter turbo-diesel with 180 horsepower is available in the two-door.\n\nThe vehicle I drove was a dark red SLT with a sticker price of nearly $35,000. It was swathed in yards of light tan leather and loaded with convenience items such as power windows and locks, power seats, keyless entry, tilt wheel, CD player and power mirrors.\n\nThe front bucket seats are wide and soft, with folding armrests, and they straddle a huge center console that has gobs of storage for maps, notes, even your lunch. A fold-out note pad holder is built into the top of the lid, and a removable cupholder reveals a place to put CDs. Two more cupholders are built into the dash. The note pad holder is a clever item that will be greatly appreciated by those who use their vehicles for work or extended trips.\n\nThe split-folding back seat can be collapsed to create up to 118 cubic feet of cargo space. Folding it down, however, requires removing the headrests and tipping the bottom seat cushion forward first.\n\nThe clamshell-type rear tailgate opens up at the top and down at the bottom. You have to reach across the outstretched tailgate to load large objects and that can be awkward.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $31,549. It was equipped with options of aluminum wheels, rear window defogger, roof-mounted luggage rack, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, power seats, keyless remote, running boards, 3.73 rear axle ratio and an AM/FM stereo cassette with CD player.\n\nThe sticker price was $34,790.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Yukon is big and brawny, yet it is as plush as a luxury car. A passenger-side irbag was added for 1997, as was a tighter turning radius.\n\nThe 255-horsepower engine gives it exceptional pulling power.\n\nCounterpoint: The clamshell tailgate can be awkward for loading large objects, and hauling around more than 5,000 pounds means fuel economy in the city sags to around 13 mpg.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.7-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: Automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 117.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,225 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $31,549\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $34,790\n\nMPG RATING: 13 city, 17 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Everything is shrinking — cell phones, digital assistants, my bank account . . .\n\nBut there are always exceptions. Take trucks.\n\nTrucks and their numbers are growing larger, as are televisions. But, since there’s little that’s very interesting to watch on the gigantic black box, why not hop in this big box and go driving?\n\nThe big container in question is the 1999 GMC Yukon Denali, top dog in the GM full-size truck stable, at least until Cadillac’s new Escalade, a Denali clone, comes along. (That’s not counting the Suburban, which is in a class by itself.)\n\nWhat distinguishes this Alaska-sized sport utility visually is front-end sheet metal that’s positively shapely. Its bold yet luxurious look leaves little doubt as to this truck’s intentions.\n\nMechanically, this is the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon. With a 117.5-inch wheelbase and 201.2-inch length, the Denali is about the dimensions of a full-size car. But with 79 inches of height and 8.6 inches of ground clearance, it seems quite a bit bigger — although it doesn’t seem as high as its main competitor, the Ford Expedition.\n\nBut it feels bigger than the Expedition. Certainly when driving it, you’re always aware of the amount of vehicle you’re handling, something not true of the Ford.\n\nNot to say there’s anything wrong with the handling. This Denali delivers a comfy ride for a truck, with decent insulation from road intrusions. There’s little side-to-side rocking. Like any truck, though, it occasionally rears its head. Rippled road surfaces are handled exceptionally well. Off-road, it’s a joy. But that width should make you think twice about squeezing into tight places.\n\nOne item that hasn’t shrunk is the engine. Power comes from the familiar Chevrolet 5.7-liter V8. This is the old 5.7, not the new one being used in other GM models. That won’t come on board until the 2000 model year. But there’s decent power here, with 255 horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque. Unlike other trucks, this is the sole drive train option. It’s good for sub 10-second 0-60 times and it always felt well-powered.\n\nThe all-wheel drive system is quite flexible, activated via dash-mounted switches. The driver can elect two-wheel (rear drive), four-wheel or automatic four-wheel drive. The last mode retains two-wheel drive until four-wheel drive is needed.\n\nWhile traveling around in your big box, you’ll find the accommodations quite suitable. The front bucket seats are wide and supportive. The leather is outright decadent, and the interior is accented with bits of real wood trim. The only disappointment is the Denali uses the same dash that the regular Yukon uses, so only wood and leather make a difference visually. The second row of seats is a pleasant place to put companions, with the usual set of rear climate controls. A third row of seats is not available, although it is on the stock Yukon.\n\nYet, for a luxury vehicle in which everything is standard, there’s no automatic climate co ntrol. Neither are there little luxuries like a passenger-side climate control, trip computer or fingertip radio controls on the steering wheel. If these seem like quibbles, keep in mind they’re available on vehicles half the Denali’s price.\n\nBut heated seats, auto-dimming rear-view mirrors, integrated garage door opener and an overhead storage console are on board. So is a convenient floor-mounted center console, with lots of neat nooks and storage bins, including a flip-up bin to hold a cell phone and note pad. It’s really handy.\n\nThe Bose audio system is excellent. It’s dash mounted, including a single-CD player. Also included is a six-CD changer in the center console. Rear-seat occupants have their own controls to access a different audio source than front-seat passengers.\n\nWhen our world was larger than it is today, size and traction meant a large Detroiter with a bag of sand in the trunk. As the world has grown smaller, and our paranoia larger, it now means buying a larg e all-wheel drive Detroiter with every option.\n\nI think I’ll go watch “The Honeymooners” on my 32-inch stereo surround-sound boob tube.\n\n1999 GMC Yukon Denali\n\nStandard: 5.7-liter overhead-valve V8, four-speed automatic transmission, “Autotrac” four-wheel drive, speed-sensitive power steering, heavy-duty Bilstein shocks, heavy-duty battery, dual front air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, power locks, power windows, keyless entry, theft deterrent system, six-way power seats, heated front and outboard rear seats, Bose stereo with six-CD changer, auto dimming rear view mirror, roof rack, dual heated outside mirrors, rear seat audio controls, rear wiper, chromed aluminum wheels, front tow hooks, Package 1SF (leather trim, front and rear air conditioning, front reclining bucket seats, AM/FM stereo/CD-cassette, Luxury Convenience Package, trailering package, floor mats, 6,800 pound GVW, P265/ 70R16 tires.\n\nOptions: None\n\nBase price: $42,855\n\nAs tested: $43,495\n\nEPA rating: 12 mpg city, 16 mpg highway",

      "expert_review": "My affection for sport-utility vehicles grows with proximity to the driver’s seat.\n\nThis became clear during recent test drives of the big 2000 GMC Yukon and the even bigger 2000 GMC Yukon XL.\n\nHad I trailed those elegant giants in a small car, I would have hated them. They block forward vision, consume road space and turn driving along construction-plagued thoroughfares into a special kind of hell.\n\nBut I was seduced in their driver’s seats. They are great trucks. From their perches, I can see forever on a clear day &#151; and pretty far when it’s cloudy, too.\n\nEven more impressive is their power to move people without touching them, to play on their big-is-bad, small-is-virtuous biases simply by being.\n\nI encountered such attitudes in both models. But it was the GMC Yukon, the mechanical and engineering twin of the Chevrolet Tahoe, that drew the most fire. The Yukon is shorter than the Yukon XL by 20.4 inches &#151; enough to give it a hunched, muscular appearance that bespeaks intimidation.\n\nAttempts to move the Yukon trough traffic in a gentlemanly manner were met with illegal blocks and attempted passes by some motorists. That forced me to get pushy. Size matters. They yielded.\n\nThe longer Yukon XL was treated more kindly. Credit familiarity. The Yukon XL is the twin of the Chevrolet Suburban, a resemblance unspoiled by such cosmetic differences as the Yukon XL’s open-mouthed grille.\n\nSuburbans have been around since 1935. Many people don’t think of them as sport-utility vehicles. They see them as big station wagons designed to tote soccer teams and tow campers. Family-values stuff. Motorists might frown about driving behind a Suburban in city traffic, but they generally don’t get nasty. Likewise, they mostly left the Yukon XL alone.\n\nThis is, in fact, the story behind the redesign of the Yukon, the Yukon XL and almost all sport-utility vehicles entering the U.S. market today. They are kinder, gentler versions of their former selves, thanks to a metamorphosis that actually began in the early 1990s.\n\nThe first sport-utes, like the first pickups, were no-compromise, hard-to-climb-into, hard-on-the-butt trucks. The mass market wanted their utility but not their discomfort. The trick was to keep them rugged enough to appeal to their original audience but make them civilized enough to pull in new buyers in need of limousines with big trunks and four-wheel drive.\n\nThat’s why the new Yukon and Yukon XL are as plush as they are tough, motorized oxymorons that can pull up to 10,500 pounds (depending on vehicle and equipment chosen) but are loaded with amenities such as heated leather seats, deep-pile carpeting, OnStar emergency and concierge communications systems, satellite-directed navigational systems, premium sound systems, sedan-type power steering, and suspension systems that offer limo rides on the highway and tank-like get- up-and-go in the rough.\n\nSo far, even rising fuel prices have failed to hurt the popularity of these thirsty beasts. The people who buy them tend to love them, while the rest of us meander in their wake, cursing their size and their appetite for resources until, perhaps, we get a sport-utility vehicle of our own.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL Complaints: Both the Yukon and Yukon XL are afflicted with relatively useless, potentially dangerous running boards, the flat steps stretching between the front and rear fenders to help passengers get into and out of the vehicle. Several women complained that the boards are too narrow to get a proper footing, especially when they are wearing high-heeled shoes. Also, they said, the hard composite material atop the boards becomes slippery when wet. Two of those women tripped getting out of the Yukon; another broke a shoe heel climbing into the Yukon XL. Can you take a look at this, Ge neral Motors?\n\nPraise: In terms of overall construction, utility, ride, handling, acceleration and comfort, the Yukon and Yukon XL easily are among the best sport-utility models on the market.\n\nDrivetrains: Three engines are available for the Yukons. Both test trucks were equipped with GM’s Vortec 5.3-liter V-8 that develops 285 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 325 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The other two engines include the 275-horsepower, 4.8-liter Vortec V-8 and the 300-horsepower, 6.8-liter Vortec V-8. All engines are mated to electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmissions. The Yukon and Yukon XL are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nCapacities: The Yukon can seat up to nine people, carry a payload of up to 1,751 pounds and tow up to 8,800 pounds of trailer weight. Fuel capacity is 26 gallons. The Yukon XL also carries up to nine people. It can haul a payload weighing up to 3,153 pounds and tow trailer weight of up to 10,500 pounds. Fuel capacity in the test model was 32.5 gallons. Regular unleaded gasoline is recommended for both vehicles.\n\nMileage: About 16 miles per gallon, combined city and highway, in the Yukon; about 14 mpg in the Yukon XL.\n\nPrices: Base price on the Yukon is $34,605. Dealer invoice on base model is $30,279. Price as tested is $41,552, including $6,272 in options and a $675 transportation charge.\n\nBase price on the Yukon XL is $37,346. Dealer invoice is $32,678. Price as tested is $43,538, including $5,482 in options and a $710 destination charge. Taxes and fees not included in these prices.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare GMC Yukon with Chevrolet Tahoe; compare the Yukon XL with Chevrolet Suburban.",

      "expert_review": "Somewhere between the massive mainstream of its full-size sport-utilities — the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL — and the prestigious pinnacle of the Cadillac Escalade, General Motors sees an opportunity.\n\nOn that narrow ledge stands the 2001 GMC Yukon Denali and the GMC Yukon XL Denali. They’re upscale, full-size SUVs that neither dabble in the mainstream nor wade in the luxury stream.\n\nLaunched about three years ago, the Denali SUVs have found their niche, reaching about 35,000 customers so far. And the all-new 2001 versions, on sale shortly, should extend that recognition, said Denny O’Donnell, the Yukon brand manager for General Motors’ GMC division.\n\n“The Denali’s been a pretty fair success for us,” O’Donnell said. “It’s pretty much a recognized name.”\n\nLos Angeles magazine recently named it as a hot vehicle in Southern California. “We were quite tickled at that,” he said.\n\nThe Yukon Denali is 198.9 inches long, the same as the 2002 Cadillac Escalade. The Yukon XL Denali is 219.3 inches long. Both are four-door, four-wheel-drive vehicles with a 320-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8.\n\nStandard equipment includes third-row seating; the AutoRide real-time dampening suspension system with automatic load leveling; front and rear air conditioning, a Bose Acoustimass audio system with 11 speakers and a six-disc CD changer; dual front and side air bags; fog lamps; the OnStar navigation system; leather seats; and a towing package.\n\nIn fact, O’Donnell said, options are few. Buyers chose from five colors, decide whether they want a sunroof and, if they’re buying an XL model, whether they want second-row bucket seats.\n\n“The truck was really done for Yukon and Suburban customers who would come in and they’d just check everything that was available. And if we had more, they wanted more,” he said.\n\nThe exterior of the Denali models have a cleaner, uncluttered look than do the basic Yukons. Most distinctive is the grille with hundreds of small (15 millimeter) air outlets, which have both a functional (engine cooling) and a design (they look cool) role.\n\n“It still has an imposing look,” O’Donnell said. “When you see one coming up behind you in the rear-view mirror, we want people to go, `Whoa, something’s back there.’ …”\n\nWhile the Denalis share many features with the Escalade, there’s enough differences — appearance, engine and more — to keep them separate in buyer’s minds, O’Donnell said.\n\nAnd Cadillac buyers and GMC buyers are very different, he said.\n\n“We’re a truck company. We’re proud of that fact that these are trucks,” he said.\n\nThat’s why GMC will emphasize the capability of the Denalis, their towing ability, their heavy-duty automatic transmission and their all-wheel-drive systems.\n\nPlus, the ride is much improved on this generation of GM full-size pickups and SUVs.\n\n“These trucks, and most trucks, for a long time have had lots o f capability,” O’Donnell said. “You can load them up, and carry a lot of junk, but they haven’t always been very much fun to drive. The new trucks are a gas to drive.”\n\nThe base Yukon XL Denali will be priced at $48,215. The shorter Yukon Denali will be $46,680.",

If you’re among that group, then there’s hardly a better big SUV on the market than our test-drive vehicle for the week – the 2005 GMC Yukon Denali.\n\nMy theory is that if you’re going to drive a vehicle that gets under 20 miles per gallon, it ought to be one that gives you your money’s worth.\n\nWithout a doubt, the Yukon Denali is one of those vehicles.\n\nThere are two versions of the Yukon Denali – the short one that corresponds in size to the Chevrolet Tahoe, and the long one, known as the Yukon XL Denali, which is the same vehicle as the Chevy Suburban, but with a lot more standard equipment than a Suburban. (Five years ago, with the rollout of the new generation of General Motors’ popular full-size SUVs, the company changed the name of the GMC version from Suburban to Yukon XL. The designation is an accurate one, as the Yukon XL is an extended-length version of the Yukon.)\n\nFor this report, we tested the short-length Yukon Denali model (base price $50,285 plus $850 freight). Although some of the Yukons – particularly, the XL models, are made at the plant in North Texas, ours was a product of the Janesville, Wisc., GM plant.\n\nMany of us here in Texas would say that the proper designation for the shorter Yukon would be “GMC Suburban XS,” for “extra-short,” since the Suburban came first, and the Yukon was an afterthought – years after — that just trimmed the three-seat Suburban to allow it to fit inside the average residential garage.\n\nChevrolet still calls its long model the Suburban, and the shorter version is the Tahoe. I suppose the Suburban name has too much goodwill associated with it to dump it entirely, say, perhaps, to call it a Tahoe XL. But even though the Yukon XL no longer carries the Suburban name, it still is, unmistakably, a Suburban. And the shorter model is simply a shorter Suburban – you get the same passenger space, just a little bit less cargo space behind the third seat.\n\nBut the Denali model is unique in that it combines all of the luxury options available on the Tahoe, Suburban and Yukon into one package, making the Denali the most-gussied-up Yukon can buy straight from the factory.\n\nThe Denali comes so well-equipped that there are few options. Ours had most of those extras, though, and they raised the price nearly $8,000, giving us a total sticker of $58,060 (including freight) for our test vehicle. Extras on ours included 20-inch chrome-aluminum wheels ($2,995); navigation system/radio in one unit ($2,145); a rear-seat DVD entertainment system ($1,295), great for the kids on long trips; and two captain’s chairs for the second row, replacing the three-person bench seat ($490).\n\nThe Denali name is not exclusive to the Yukon; GM also now sells a midsize Envoy sport utility with the Denali designation, as well as a full-size Sierra Denali pickup (identical to the Yukon from the nose to the back of the second seat, where it then gets a pickup bed).\n\nBut you can’t buy a Denali with Chevrolet/Suburban badging, because this variation is limited to the GMC brand. Denali is the Indian name of Alaska’s highest mountain, Mount McKinley, and also the name of a national park on that mountain.\n\nAdding these unique luxury models to the GMC line is one way that GM is trying to differentiate the otherwise parallel truck lines that carry the Chevrolet and GMC names. GM wants GMC Trucks to be positioned as more upscale than Chevy trucks, particularly in the way they come packaged from the factory.\n\nWhat that means is that you can take a Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, Silverado or TrailBlazer and add available options to make it about as fancy as the GMC Denali models of the same vehicles, but you have to work at it – it isn’t already done for you the way it is on the Denali.\n\nOf course, there is an even fancier version of these vehicles available – more expensive, too. Those are the Cadillac Escalade and the Escalade ESV, which correspond in size to the Tahoe/Yukon and Suburban/Yukon XL.\n\nThe Denali and Denali XL have a 6.0-liter V-8 engine that, for 2005, now turns out 335 horsepower (up from 320 last year) and 375 foot-pounds of torque (up from 365). Fuel economy also has been slightly improved, to 13 miles per gallon city/17 mpg highway, up from last year’s 12 city/15 highway.\n\nLength of the Yukon Denali is 198.9 inches, compared with 219.3 inches for the Yukon Denali XL.\n\nAll of the Denalis come with full-time four-wheel drive, however, while the base models of the Yukon and Yukon XL have two-wheel drive, and are available with four-wheel drive.\n\nBesides the increased power and better fuel economy, changes for 2005 include those optional chrome wheels that came on our tester; a new touch-screen navigation system (also on our test vehicle); two new exterior colors (steel-gray metallic and blue-green crystal; and an improved OnStar system.\n\nInside, the vehicles feature plush two-tone leather trimmed seats, 10-way power controlled front bucket seats, heated front and middle seats, an extended floor console with driver information center, wood interior trim, six-disc CD changer, three-zone automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass and outside temperature display, and power windows/mirrors/door locks (with programmable auto-lock feature).\n\nOther standard features include 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, four-speed automatic transmission with tow-haul mode, heavy-duty trailering package, stainless-steel exhaust, driver and front passenger air bags and side-impact air bags, four-wheel disc antilock brakes, battery rundown protection, remote keyless entry with alarm, luggage rack, cruise control, steering-wheel audio controls, automatic headlights, daytime running lights, power-adjustable floor pedals, Stabilitrak stability-control system, tire-pressure monitors, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, and fog lights.\n\nThe standard full-time, all-wheel-drive system requires no driver input – you can’t change it back to two-wheel drive, for instance. And it has no low-range gearing for serious off-road driving.\n\nThe AutoRide suspension offer great traction under almost any weather or road conditions. AutoRide uses a real-time damping system to select the best suspension settings for different road conditions. A fully automatic rear air-leveling system, working in conjunction with coil springs, helps to maintains the vehicles’ height regardless of how much weight they carry.\n\nAlso included are GM’s OnStar navigation/communications system, which offers automatic emergency assistance when air bags deploy, and remote unlocking and diagnostics services. Optional OnStar services include hands-free calling and e-mail, as well as concierge services – which can be used to get hotel and restaurant reservations and even tickets to popular theater productions.\n\nOur test car came with seven-passenger seating, with the two bucket seats up front, the two center-row captain’s chairs, and a rear bench seats.\n\nAlthough the vehicle sits up high, it’s fairly easy to get into and out of, thanks to some fancy running boards and lots of convenient grab handles.\n\nRide is more carlike than ever, although this still is, essentially, a full-size pickup closed in to make a big station wagon. Don’t expect it to ride like a Cadillac sedan. Trailer-towing is the Yukon’s strong suit: The short Denali model can tow up to 8,100 pounds.\n\nThe tank holds 26 gallons of gasoline, and regular unleaded is recommended.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "One of the biggest hassles of driving a full-size pickup truck is parking. Swinging into parking lot spaces, or parallel parking, is a bit of a challenge because the long wheelbase compromises the turning radius.\n\nGMC’s luxurious Denali pickup, however, is now standard with Quadrasteer, a four-wheel steering system that gives this truck carlike maneuverability and enhanced towing safety.\n\nAt walking speeds, it turns the back wheels opposite to the front, and that tightens the turning circle by 21 percent. This big truck turns as tightly as a Saturn coupe.\n\nAt higher speeds, the rear wheels turn the same direction as the fronts, enhancing stability in crosswinds and lane-change maneuvers. Four-wheel steering also improves trailer towing. GMC says that the truck and trailer “move as if they were one.”\n\nIn normal driving, the Denali with Quadrasteer feels as nimble as a sedan. Whipping around corners or changing lanes does not have the awkwardness one feels in most long trucks.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive 2002 Denali, GMC’s luxury/sport pickup, was formerly known as the Sierra C3. The name has been changed to match the Denali SUV. The Vortec 6.0-liter, 325-horsepower V-8 is an absolute gem. It has the muscles of a weightlifter and the speed of a sprinter. Even though it lacks multiple valves and overhead cams, this engine is strong, smooth and stout. It swigs gas at a considerable rate, 11 miles per gallon in the city and 14 on the highway, but that is comparable to other trucks in this segment.\n\nThe automatic transmission’s tow-haul setting changes the transmission’s shift points for optimum response when climbing hills or pulling a trailer. Denali can tow an 8,000-pound trailer. All-wheel drive gives the Denali excellent over-the-road manners, plus it can tackle winter weather or moderate off-roading with equal aplomb. Seventeen-inch wheels house heavy-duty disc brakes, borrowed from the three-quarter-ton Sierra, on all four wheels.\n\nThe interior is quite cozy. Wood trim abounds, and the quality of the two-tone leather that adorns seats, console and door panels is on par with the best of any luxury sedans. The widely adjustable seats cradle their occupants with ample side and lumbar padding. The large center console can accommodate sizable objects, plus it has its own power outlet inside. The underside of the lid has a handy place for carrying a cell phone or note pad.\n\nThe steering-wheel controls for the audio system look like afterthoughts.\n\nAccess to the back seat is through side-opening rear doors that are not as roomy as a full four-door truck. The back seat is big enough for kids, and it can be folded to create storage space. Rear-seat audio controls and cupholders are built into the back of the center console.\n\nOnStar, GM’s GPS-based wireless communication system, is also a part of the Denali package. OnStar advisers communicate with the driver to provide a wide range of services, from checking routes to arrang ing accommodations. The system notifies an adviser in case of an airbag activation, and emergency help can be automatically dispatched.\n\nThe addition of Quadrasteer to the Denali pickup makes this one of the more agile and easy-to-drive trucks. Expect this feature to be optional on other models in the near future.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test truck was $43,385. There were no options, so the sticker price was $44,105 with delivery.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Four-wheel steering was the hot ticket on a few cars in the early 1990s, but it fell out of favor. Using it on a truck, however, is brilliant because it enhances maneuverability and stability, especially for towing. The Denali truck is loaded with luxury, all-wheel drive and 325 horsepower.\n\nCounterpoint: A bigger back seat and full-size back doors would make this truck an even more useful vehicle for families. Even though it is luxurious, i is quite expensive. Gas mileage is also an issue, and fingertip controls on the steering wheel look like an afterthought.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 6.0-liter, 325 hp V-8\nTransmission: automatic All-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 143.5 inches\nCurb weight: 5,478 lbs.\nBase price: $43,385\nAs driven: $44,105\nMpg rating: 11 city, 14 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2010 GMC Yukon is the middle child among GM’s full-size SUVs. Based on price and equipment, the Yukon sits squarely between the Chevrolet Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade. Four-wheel drive is available on the Yukon, as are seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Competitors include the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nThe Yukon Hybrid and Yukon XL are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2010\nAll versions of the 2010 Yukon can now run on E85.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon has a one-piece grille and taller headlights than its sister Tahoe, with jewel-like bezels and a wider, lower air dam. The rest of the body features blocky fenders, long rear-quarter windows and a squared-off back end. The Yukon is also available in a higher-end Denali trim level. Denali models come with 20-inch wheels, chrome exterior moldings and a power-operated rear liftgate. At 202 inches long and 79 inches wide, the Yukon is a bit shorter than the Expedition and Sequoia but about the same width.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nIntegrated running boards\nStandard 17-inch aluminum wheels\nStandard heated power side mirrors\nOptional 20-inch wheels\nChrome grille (Denali edition)\nOptional articulating running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s dashboard has the same shape as its redesigned GM siblings. That’s good news because the domed instrument panel, car-like dashboard and flush-mounted buttons are a vast improvement on the rectangular fixtures of previous Yukons.\n\nThis SUV has the ability to seat up to nine occupants when benches are placed in all three rows. Uplevel models replace first- and second-row benches with captain’s chairs, lowering total seating capacity to seven. The second-row seats fold forward, either manually or via an available power mechanism. The third row is removable, but it doesn’t fold flat to the floor as some competitors’ seats do. Third-row seating is standard on all models.\n\nWith both rows stashed away, maximum cargo volume is 108.9 cubic feet, which is roughly the same as the Expedition but less than the Sequoia.\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nStandard XM Satellite Radio with real-time traffic and route advisements\nAvailable cloth, vinyl or leather-appointed seats\nOptional power fold-and-tumble second row\nAvailable integrated rear camera in rearview mirror\nAvailable heated/cooled seats (Denali models)\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon can be had with either rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have an all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the Yukon can tow up to 8,500 pounds. The XFE boasts an EPA-estimated 15/21 mpg city/highway.\n\nPowertrain features include:\n\nFlex-fuel 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque (350 pounds-feet when running on E85) and an available cylinder-deactivation system\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nFuel-saving 3.08:1 axle ratio\nOptional variable load-leveling suspension\nPower rack-and-pinion steering\n\nSafety\nSafety options include a blind spot warning system, rear parking assist and a rearview camera system integrated into the rearview mirror.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSide-mounted thorax airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 GMC Yukon is a massive full-size SUV for those who need hauling capability and like a feeling of spaciousness on the inside. However, if you don’t enjoy a body-on-frame trucklike ride, this probably isn’t the SUV for you.\n\nI grew up in the back of my dad’s Chevrolet Suburban, riding up to the mountains in the winter and out to the lake in the summer — in my Miss Piggy sleeping bag, perched precariously atop the dog kennels in the cargo area. (Seat belts? What seat belts?) Driving the 2015 Yukon certainly offered me a feeling of nostalgia, though with a much more modern, upscale interior.\n\nLike its sister the Chevrolet Tahoe, the GMC Yukon underwent a thorough overhaul for 2015, including some features that busy families will appreciate: a sleeker exterior; an available programmable-height power liftgate; fold-flat second- and third-row seats (with an available power-folding feature); a 110-volt, three-pronged outlet to charge anything you can think of; available keyless entry with push-button start; a conversation mirror to keep an eye on youngsters in the back; a new family of engines that improve gas mileage by nearly 10 percent; and a whole slew of new safety features (see Safety section below). Compare the 2015 and 2014 versions here.\n\nThe GMC Yukon is available in either rear- or four-wheel-drive versions of SLE, SLT and Denali trim styles. Compare the four-wheel-drive versions side by side here. The Yukon also comes in an extended version, the Yukon XL, which is akin to the Chevrolet Suburban (itself an extended Tahoe). Both the GMC Yukon Denali and GMC Yukon XL Denali come with an eight-speed automatic. See the regular Yukon and Yukon XL compared side by side here.\n\nIf the full-size GMC Yukon isn’t your cup of tea, you may also want to take the time to research the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada or Toyota Sequoia. See them side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Yukon comes with some nice, modern updates this year. Its slightly squared-off back end, the blingy 20-inch polished aluminum wheels on my SLT test car and a standard rear spoiler give the Yukon a boy-racer-meets-“Man Vs. Wild” look that’s equally at home traversing mountain streams and tackling the rigors of daily carpooling.\n\nWith a step-in height of 22 inches, assist steps on the outside of the Yukon are standard and an absolute must for climbing in and out of this tall beast (illuminated power retractable ones are available on the Yukon Denali version). Of course, once you step up onto the running board you’ll need to watch your head under the roofline. It’s not an elegant process for someone of my 5-foot 3-inch stature. My two younger daughters (ages 9 and 11) were short enough to not worry about hitting their heads when using the assist step to climb up and into the SUV.\n\nHow It Drives\nTo me, the GMC Yukon felt very much its full-size SUV self on the road. With such an upscale look and feel to the interior, I guess I was expecting some type of magic to make the Yukon drive more like a car, but that didn’t happen. The rear wheels are almost 2 inches farther apart this year in an attempt to improve cornering performance. However, there was still too much body roll for my comfort, not only in corners but also with just slight steering adjustments. My middle daughter said she liked how it felt soft and comfortable when going straight, but that she felt like she was going to tip over every time we turned. “It feels like riding in a giant wobbly box,” she said. This sensation seems to be more noticeable for passengers than for the driver.\n\nThe Yukon comes with an electric variable assist power steering system that felt quite odd to me. You have to start out muscling the weight of this car into a corner, and then you feel the assist take over and lighten the load. It’s difficult to anticipate and makes it hard to maintain consistent steering feel.\n\nBraking feels as if you’re trying to get a 5,500-pound (plus the weight of my family) beast to come to a stop, despite brake-pedal revisions that were supposed to provide “stronger-feeling, more confident braking performance.” I may have taken a few rolling stops at the beginning of my week in the Yukon before really getting a feel for the distance and force needed to come to a complete stop.\n\nOne area in which I was pleasantly surprised was the Yukon’s maneuverability and better-than-expected 39-foot turning circle. In comparison, the Ford Expedition’s and Nissan Armada’s turning circles are 40.8 feet. The Toyota Sequoia beats the crowd with a turning circle of 38.1 feet.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Yukon’s standard 5.3-liter V-8 engine with active fuel management operates in four-cylinder mode whenever possible to improve fuel economy. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. The two-wheel-drive Yukon with the 5.3-liter engine gets a slight mileage bump, up to a 23 mpg highway rating. Upgrading to a beefier, 6.2-liter engine takes the combined gas mileage down to 16 and 17 mpg for the four-wheel drive and two-wheel drive, respectively — a nearly 10 percent improvement over the 2014 Yukon.\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s interior is plush and comfortable, feeling like a living room on wheels.\n\nAs silly as it may seem, my favorite feature had to be the massive center console that easily swallowed my purse and/or laptop and iPad. Hey, it’s the little things in life that count, right? With a teenage daughter who recently “graduated” to riding in the front seat, I’m feeling increasingly claustrophobic in my test cars, with no place for my stuff. If I stash my purse on the floor in the front, she steps on it. When I put in on the floor in the back, my two younger daughters step on it, spilling the contents into the dark, scary recesses of under-seat hell. In the Yukon, everyone has elbow room to spare, along with plenty of storage to keep their (and my) things tidy and organized.\n\nI also had access to a large, super-secret storage area behind the center touch-screen as well as in-door storage in the front and rear doors. The cupholders in the rear-door armrests were a hit with the kiddos.\n\nMy test vehicle came equipped with second-row captain’s chairs with a huge aisle between them, making the third row easily accessible. I was surprised, however, to see that the seat belts for the captain’s chairs were not height-adjustable. My two younger daughters fit properly in the captain’s chairs with their feet flat on the floor, knees bent over the front edge of the seat and backs up against the backrests, but the seat belts cut quite high on their necks, making me ultimately opt to put them in boosters (much to their dismay). Having such a high seat belt seems inconsistent with the average size of kids, who are likely passengers.\n\nThe third row was totally uncomfortable, even for my kids during short trips. The Yukon’s stadiumlike seating configuration means the third row is raised up a bit on a platform, so even kids’ knees are practically up at chin level. The center seat belt in the third row extends from the roofline, cutting way too high on the neck for comfort or proper fit.\n\nThe available heated and cooled front seats are a great touch, but the seats’ cooling fan is a bit loud, made more noticeable by how quiet the Yukon’s interior otherwise is. Aerodynamic changes for 2015, along with a laminated windshield and front side windows, cut down quite a bit on ambient noise in the SUV. For shoppers seeking even more peace and quiet, the GMC Yukon Denali version has active noise-canceling technology inside.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Yukon’s Bluetooth phone and audio system pairs and reconnects seamlessly. The touch-screen panel feels like it should be angled slightly toward the driver for easier access and visibility — though when riding in the passenger seat I appreciated that it was centrally directed so I could operate it as well.\n\nThe air controls were all easy to operate at a quick glance while keeping my eyes on the road — no navigating through multiple menu screens just to turn the fan up, as some modern vehicles require. There are separate controls up front for both front and rear air.\n\nA three-pronged household 120-volt outlet was a nice addition up front.\n\nThe available rear-seat entertainment system ended our love affair with the electronic simplicity we’d found up front. My 11-year-old daughter was super excited to test it out on a longer than usual evening drive, but she couldn’t get a movie to play on her own in the back and I couldn’t help from the front. She bitterly wanted me to note that she thinks GMC tried to make it look fun and easy to use — with a remote with large buttons that looks like a video game remote — but that it’s not easy to use at all. Additionally, the entertainment screen folds down from the roofline, completely blocking my view in the rearview mirror.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo space behind the third row is surprisingly small, at just 15.3 cubic feet. This can expand up to 94.7 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded, but for such a large vehicle I was really expecting more cargo space along with full seating capacity. Even a Mini Countryman beats that number, with 16.5 cubic feet of cargo space with its seats up. This is where the XL version of the Yukon pays off, providing 38.9 cubic feet behind the third row and a total of 121.1 cubic feet — while also increasing third-row legroom from 24.8 to 34.5 inches.\n\nSticking with the shorter models, the Expedition, Sequoia, and Armada have 18.6, 18.9 and 20.0 cubic feet of volume behind their third rows, respectively.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 GMC Yukon four-wheel drive has an overall crash-test rating of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This comes from a five-star frontal crash-test rating, a five-star side crash-test rating and a three-star rollover-resistance rating. That lower rollover rating isn’t uncommon for truck-based SUVs, but it’s become rare overall for most SUV models.\n\nGMC has added some pretty interesting new safety features this year, including a standard front center airbag that protects the driver and front passenger from one another in the event of a side crash or rollover. A backup camera is also standard. Forward collision alert, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available, along with an optional safety alert seat that lets the driver know of potential dangers via a slight vibration to the driver’s seat on the side from which the danger is pending. It’s a great feature, as a simple tone alert can easily be drowned out by typical family noise inside a car.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats with a five-point harness in the captain’s chairs is a cinch because you can adjust the back angle of each seat independently, creating a more snug, custom fit for your car seat. Latch anchors in the captain’s chairs of my test car were also visible and easily accessible.\n\nSee all the Yukon’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nRinging in at more than $64,000, my as-tested car hardly seemed like a bargain. For the amount of actual usable space it offers, I’d probably direct my search toward the new Dodge Durango, which would come in well under this price (to the tune of about 20 grand), even fully loaded. However, the four-wheel drive Yukon has a long history of brand loyalty passed from one family member to the next, along with the ability to tow up to 8,500 pounds. This gives it a leg up with active families hauling boats or campers on the weekends.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2011 GMC Yukon is the middle child among GM’s full-size SUVs. Based on price and equipment, the Yukon sits squarely between the Chevrolet Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade. Four-wheel drive is available on the Yukon, as are seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Competitors include the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nThe Yukon XL is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon has a one-piece grille and taller headlights than its sister Tahoe, with jewel-like bezels and a wider, lower air dam. The rest of the body features blocky fenders, long rear-quarter windows and a squared-off back end. The Yukon is also available in a higher-end Denali trim level. Denali models come with 20-inch wheels, chrome exterior moldings and a power-operated rear liftgate.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nIntegrated running boards\nStandard 17-inch aluminum wheels\nStandard heated power side mirrors\nOptional 20-inch wheels\nChrome grille (Denali edition)\nOptional articulating running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s dashboard has the same shape as its GM siblings. That’s good news because the domed instrument panel, carlike dashboard and flush-mounted buttons make for a handsome design.\n\nThis SUV can seat up to nine occupants when benches are placed in all three rows. Some models replace first- and second-row benches with captain’s chairs, lowering total seating capacity to seven.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2012 GMC Yukon is the middle child among GM’s full-size SUVs. Based on price and equipment, the Yukon sits squarely between the Chevrolet Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade. Four-wheel drive is available on the Yukon, as are seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Competitors include the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nThe Yukon XL is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Yukon SLT now comes standard with heated leather front seats; a heated steering wheel is optional. A blind spot warning system now comes on Denali models. A new navigation radio with a USB port and the ability to record broadcasts is optional.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon has a one-piece grille and taller headlights than its sister Tahoe, with jewel-like bezels and a wider, lower air dam. The rest of the body features blocky fenders, long rear-quarter windows and a squared-off back end. The Yukon is also available in a higher-end Denali trim level. Denali models come with 20-inch wheels, chrome exterior trim and a power-operated liftgate. Exterior features include:\n\nIntegrated running boards\nStandard 17-inch aluminum wheels\nStandard heated power side mirrors\nOptional 20-inch wheels\nChrome honeycomb grille (Denali)\nOptional power-operated running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s dashboard has the same shape as its GM siblings. That’s good news because the domed instrument panel, carlike dashboard and flush-mounted buttons make for a handsome design.\n\nThis SUV can seat up to nine occupants when benches are placed in all three rows. Some models replace first- and second-row benches with captain’s chairs, lowering total seating capacity to seven. The third row is removable, but it doesn’t fold flat to the floor as some competitors’ seats do. Third-row seating is standard on all models. Interior features include:\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nStandard Bose stereo\nAvailable sunroof\nAvailable cloth or leather-appointed seats\nAvailable integrated backup camera in rearview mirror\nAvailable heated/cooled front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon is available with either rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have an all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon. When properly equipped, the Yukon can tow up to 8,500 pounds. Mechanical features include:\n\nFlex-fuel 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nBoth V-8s feature fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation technology\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nOptional load-leveling rear suspension\nOptional Off-Road Suspension Package\n\nSafety\nSafety options include a blind spot warning system, rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Standard safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front row\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control, trailer-sway control and hill start assist\nRecovery hooks",

      "expert_review": "In terms of comfort, GMC’s redesigned Yukon Denali is closer to a Cadillac than a GMC truck.\n\nThe Denali is the most luxurious version of the Yukon, and it shares its 116-inch chassis and basic mechanical components with the Chevy Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade. The Denali is on par with the Escalade.\n\nThe first thing you notice about the Denali’s new styling is the sleek windshield, blunt nose and perforated chrome grille. The stance looks purposefully low, even though it has decent ground clearance. The Yukon’s styling is accented with jewel-look lights that have halogen bulbs in front. The rear lights sit behind clear lenses.\n\nThe Denali has full-time all-wheel drive with no extra-low gearing for off-road use. All-wheel drive provides good traction in a variety of conditions without the driver having to manually select four-wheel drive.\n\nHandy features include power adjustable pedals and a power liftgate, which is especially useful when you have your hands full of kids, groceries or suitcases.\n\nThe test car’s interior was inviting because it has a handsome mixture of metallic surfaces, wood trim and leather. The steering wheel spokes are covered with brushed titanium pieces that look like metal. Fingertip controls for cruise control and audio make highway driving easier.\n\nThe large gauges have light gray numerals that I found hard to read during cloudy days. Illuminating the gauges during the daytime would have erased that problem.\n\nThe center stack has large, flat knobs, woodgrain trim and easy-to-use controls for audio and climate control.\n\nThe lid that covers the center console’s cup holder glides open quietly like one in a luxury sedan. The downside to the lid, however, is that it snags the tops of drink cups.\n\nEven though the Denali’s seats are thinner than the previous model’s, they are still soft and cushy. They have more fore and aft travel, too. Lateral and lumbar support is quite good, and the lumbar support can be adjusted to suit each driver. I missed inboard armrests when I drove on the highway.\n\nAn optional power fold-and-tumble second-row seat eases access to the third-row seat. The driver can release the seat, or there are buttons on the C-pillar.\n\nThe third-row seat takes up most of the luggage space when it is in place. When folded, it still takes up a sizable chunk of the trunk’s space. Removing the seat for hauling leaves large seat tracks in the cargo floor. GMC should have designed a third seat that folds into the cargo floor.\n\nThe Yukon Denali comes with a 6.2-liter, 380-horsepower V-8 and a six-speed automatic transmission. This engine produces over 400 pound-feet of torque, which is useful for towing big trailers or hauling heavy loads.\n\nThe automatic transmission has a manual-shift function that would be useful for towing trailers or driving in the mountains.\n\nFuel economy is rated at 13 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway. I averaged 17.5 on a highway trip with one person on board.\n\nIt’s too bad the Denali isn’t available with a high-tech diesel engine that would give about 25 percent better fuel economy.\n\nHighway cruising is extremely comfortable. The ride is smooth, wind noise is minimal, and the cabin is lavishly equipped. Price\n\nThe test vehicle had a base price of $47,115. Options included 20-inch chrome wheels, rear-seat entertainment system and power sunroof. The sticker price was $52,275. Warranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 6.2-liter, 380-hp V-8\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,674 lbs.\n\nBase price: $47,115\n\nAs driven: $52,275\n\nMPG rating: 13 city, 19 hwy.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 6.2-liter, 380-hp V-8\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,674 lbs.\n\nBase price: $47,115\n\nAs driven: $52,275\n\nMPG rating: 13 city, 19 hwy.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: The Denali is the fanciest Yukon, and it is plush and luxurious. The interior is as nice as any expensive sedan, with great textures, supportive seats and smooth controls. The 6.2-liter engine enables heavy towing.\n\nCounterpoint: The Yukon’s third seat is cumbersome when folded, and has to be removed completely for maximum cargo hauling. Fuel economy isn’t great.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon full-size sport utility vehicle is closely related to the Chevrolet Tahoe, and both models are based on General Motors’ full-size pickup trucks. The Yukon and Tahoe compete against such full-size SUVs as the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, and Toyota’s Land Cruiser and Sequoia.\n\nGMC also sells a larger SUV called the Yukon XL, which is comparable to the Chevrolet Suburban. SLE and SLT trim levels in the Yukon lineup come with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive that includes Low-range gearing.\n\nGM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard, and a DVD-based touch-screen navigation radio can be installed. Ultra Bright 17-inch wheels are optional. Several other features, including an electrochromatic rearview mirror, GM’s OnStar communication system and steering-wheel auxiliary controls, become standard for 2006.\n\nA luxurious Denali edition is equipped with permanently engaged all-wheel drive, leather upholstery and specific front-end styling. Standard Yukon Denali equipment includes a monochrome exterior color scheme, a nine-speaker Bose audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer, XM Satellite Radio and 17-inch tires. A 335-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 powers the Denali. Seven-spoke, chrome-plated cast-aluminum wheels that measure 20 inches in diameter are available.\n\nExterior\nDifferences between the Yukon and Tahoe are primarily in the grille, where a prominent GMC badge is featured on the Yukon. The four-door Yukon measures 198.9 inches long overall, placing it between the midsize Envoy (191.6) and the full-size Yukon XL (219.3) in GMC’s lineup. Built on a 116-inch wheelbase, the rear-drive Yukon is 78.9 inches wide and 76.7 inches tall (including the roof rack). It is equipped with standard 16-inch tires and a tire-pressure-monitoring system.\n\nInterior\nYukons can accommodate as many as nine occupants when properly equipped. Depending on the model, the first row can be equipped with two bucket seats or a three-place bench. The middle row can feature a three-place bench or captain’s chairs, and a three-place rear bench can be installed. Built-in wheels aid the removal of the folding middle and rear seats. Cargo volume is nearly 105 cubic feet when the middle and rear seats are removed, but space decreases to 16.3 cubic feet when all the seats are in place. Adjustable pedals are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe SLE and SLT get either a 285-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 or a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 that can run on a combination of gasoline and ethanol fuel. The Yukon Denali is equipped with a 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. All engines work with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Denali has computer-controlled shock absorbers that change their stiffness based on driving conditions.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage occupant-sensing front airbags, antilock brakes and StabiliTrak are standard. Side-impact airbags are standard in the Denali and optional in other Yukons.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDespite its size, the Yukon is surprisingly easy to drive. It steers with a light touch and delivers a pleasantly smooth ride. Denali models are loaded with luxuries, perform with vigorous throttle response and demonstrate few truck sensations. The navigation screen is mounted high, but it’s small.",

      "expert_review": "About 15 years ago, something interesting happened: Buyers of big, ostentatious luxury SUVs started making a different choice, eschewing the big, glitzy, popular Cadillac Escalade for the GMC Yukon instead. It offered almost everything buyers wanted in a full-size luxury SUV without the need to explain why they were buying a Cadillac during the Great Recession. Sure, it was still expensive, thirsty and just plain yuge, but it was also a bit of a stealth move to fly under the radar of other peoples’ ire. And the birth of the Denali sub-brand took off. That trend happily continues with the 2025 Yukon and even gets built upon by a more off-road-ready version of GMC’s big luxobarge. I got an in-person look at the new Yukon ahead of its reveal to the public.\n\nRelated: 2025 GMC Yukon: Big Is Beautiful\n\nIt Certainly Looks Good\n\nThe Yukon’s styling has always been attractive, and the latest update only improves upon its looks. It’s fun that you can get two different versions — either go the luxury route down the Denali hole or go the off-road path via the AT4 trail. I’m not entirely sure how many Yukon AT4 buyers are actually going too far off-road in their nearly $74,000 (including destination) SUVs (that’s the least expensive version of the 2024 Yukon AT4), but the thing certainly has the equipment to do so. Adding in the new AT4 Ultimate trim level is fun, but it will almost certainly be eye-wateringly expensive.\n\nBut being able to get the turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine in any of the Yukon’s trims makes it even more compelling — especially since it’s being discontinued in the Escalade for 2025. So if you want a redesigned Escalade with the diesel, you’re out of luck, but thankfully the Yukon Denali is nearly as nice, not quite as overburdened with the Escalade’s new screen fetish and can still be had with the extraordinary oil-burner motor.\n\nNo Screen Fetish\n\nAh yes, the screen fetish of the Escalade — it’s not seen here in the Yukon. Yes, there’s a massive new central 16.8-inch vertically oriented touchscreen that dominates the entire center console, but it looks good and doesn’t put every function behind the glass. There are still buttons and knobs for high-use items like audio and climate controls, which is something to be celebrated as they minimize distractions for drivers as they’re operating the vehicle.\n\nThe switch to the Google-based operating system for all vehicle voice and multimedia controls is something we’re less thrilled about, however, as our experience with Google systems has been decidedly mixed. If there’s weak or no data connection between the car and the cloud (which would happen if you’re overlanding your Yukon AT4 Ultimate across the vast, empty stretches of the American Southwest), you’ll find yourself frustratingly without a lot of simple voice-command functions, like changing radio stations.\n\nThe rest of the Yukon’s interior feels as good as those in all of the new GM vehicles; it’s opulent, well thought out, comfortable and very usable. The new dashboard makes a huge difference as well; just like in the Chevy Tahoe, it’s considerably lower than the prior model’s, dramatically improving forward visibility over the Yukon’s tall hood. The Yukon no longer has a high-mounted screen thanks to the deep vertical display that further improves outward views. And like prior versions, the second- and third-row seats are eminently comfortable and usable. Yukons are huge — there’s no way around that — but this is the reason people buy them.\n\nFor those wishing to have a more traditional American luxury full-size SUV experience without the increasingly space-age, screen-based push coming for the next Escalade, the Yukon makes an excellent case for itself.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nGMC Teases 2025 Yukon, Shows Exterior Refresh\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban: Smoother Super-Sized SUVs\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 GMC Yukon?\n2021 GMC Yukon Denali Review: Finally, the Denali Is Different\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s not often a three-quarter-ton SUV can be wheeled into a parking spot like a family sedan, but the availability of four-wheel steering on General Motors’ big SUVs has dramatically enhanced the maneuverability of GMC’s Yukon XL 2500 and the Chevrolet Suburban 2500.\n\nThis system, a $4,495 option, was offered on last year’s GMC Denali pickup. When activated by a button on the instrument panel, it turns the rear wheels in the opposite direction as the front wheels at low speed and in the same direction as the fronts at high speed. Four-wheel steering transforms a normally cumbersome vehicle into one that drives as if it were much smaller, plus it improves stability in crosswinds and lane-change maneuvers. Four-wheel steering also improves trailer towing. GMC says that the truck and trailer “move as if they were one.” Turning all four wheels reduces the Yukon XL’s turning radius from 44 feet to 35 feet, which is pretty remarkable for a vehicle with a 130-inch wheelbase. Turning into parking spaces no longer takes two tries, and parallel parking is a snap.\n\nThe three-quarter-ton’s 6.0-liter Vortec V-8 and heavy duty chassis make it an ideal tow vehicle, and that is how the test vehicle was configured. The four-wheel-drive model can tow 5,443 pounds, while two-wheel-drive can tow 12,000 pounds. When towing a trailer, the outside mirrors can be extended electronically for better rear vision. The right side mirror is not convex like most mirrors, and that means there is a sizable blind spot on the right side. The 320-horsepower, 6.0-liter Vortec V-8 is an absolute gem, and its low-speed power makes it especially good for towing. Even though it lacks multiple valves and overhead cams, this engine is strong and smooth. The electronic throttle control was hypersensitive, and the vehicle surged as my foot moved when the vehicle rode over bumps. Gas mileage figures are not required for vehicles over 8,500 pounds, but suffice it to say that this vehicle has quite an appetite for fuel. The test vehicle’s four-wheel-drive system can be operated in two-wheel, four-wheel or four-wheel automatic modes. Low range is available for off-road conditions.\n\nThe automatic transmission has a tow-haul setting that changes the transmission’s shift points for optimum response when climbing hills or pulling a trailer.\n\nThe Yukon XL is designed to haul up to seven passengers in three rows of seats. The test vehicle had second-row captain’s chairs. The folding third-row seat would be more useful for carrying large objects if it folded flat into the load floor.\n\nComfort and convenience are given top billing. A three-zone heating/cooling system enables passengers to pick their own temperature. Various audio and video systems keep back-seat riders occupied. The rear-seat entertainment center, a $1,295 option, includes a DVD player with a screen that flips down from the ceiling. The test vehicle was also equipped with an XM satellite radio receiver. XM radio s receive signals for 100 coast-to-coast channels, including 71 for varying types of music, that stay the same all across the country. XMÕs sound is top-notch and the choice of programming vast. A $9.99 monthly subscription fee is required.\n\nGMC cleaned up the design of the instrument panel which now contains readouts for as many as 30 vehicle functions. The audio system and center console have been simplified.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test truck was $41,262. The option list amounted to an additional $13,395, and it consisted of leather seats, Bose stereo, rear-seat audio controls, power adjustable pedals, cargo net, in-dash six-disc CD player, XM radio, DVD player, quadrasteer, second-row captain’s chairs, heavy duty trailer package, roof-marker lights, 4.10 rear axle ratio and side airbags.\n\nThe sticker price was $55,447.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Four-wheel steering was the hot ticket on some cars in the early 1990s, but it fell out of favor. GMC now offers it on the Yukon XL 2500, and it is brilliant because it enhances maneuverability and stability, especially for towing.\n\nCounterpoint: An overly sensitive throttle pedal was annoying, and carrying cargo was not easy unless the third seat was removed. Expect to spend a lot on gasoline.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 6.0-liter, 320-hp V-8\nTransmission: automatic Four-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 130 inches\nCurb weight: 5,760 lbs.\nBase price: $41,262\nAs driven: $55,447\nMpg rating: not avail.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon full-size sport utility vehicle is closely related to the Chevrolet Tahoe and is based on General Motors’ full-size pickup trucks. The Yukon and Tahoe were redesigned for the 2000 model year and compete against such full-size SUVs as the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, and Toyota’s Land Cruiser and Sequoia.\n\nGMC also sells a larger version, called the Yukon XL, which is comparable to the Chevrolet Suburban. The half-ton Yukons come with either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive that includes Low-range gearing.\n\nFor the 2004 model year, the Yukon gains Hydroboost braking. This feature provides greater stopping power with less pedal effort in high-deceleration halts, and it is said to improve ABS performance. A tire-pressure monitor joins the standard equipment list, and the right front passenger gets a seat belt reminder. For the first time, a sunroof and DVD entertainment system for the rear seat can be installed on the same vehicle. New 17-inch six-spoke premium aluminum wheels are available on Yukons with the SLT option group.\n\nA luxury Denali edition is equipped with permanently engaged all-wheel drive, leather upholstery and specific front-end styling. Standard Yukon Denali equipment includes a monochrome exterior color scheme, a nine-speaker Bose audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer, GM’s OnStar communication system, XM Satellite Radio and 17-inch tires. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is optional on the regular Yukon and standard on the Denali.\n\nExterior\nThe differences between the Yukon and Tahoe are found mainly in the grille, where a prominent GMC badge is featured on the Yukon. The four-door Yukon is slotted between the midsize Envoy and the full-size Yukon XL. Built on a 116-inch wheelbase, the rear-drive Yukon measures 198.8 inches long overall, 78.9 inches wide and 76.7 inches tall (which includes the roof rack) and is equipped with standard 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon accommodates as few as seven and as many as nine occupants. Depending on the model, the front compartment may consist of two bucket seats or a three-place bench. A three-place middle bench and a three-place rear bench go into all standard Yukons, but separate second-row captain’s chairs are available. The folding middle and rear seats may be removed with the help of built-in wheels. Cargo volume is close to 105 cubic feet when the middle and rear seats are removed, but only 16.1 cubic feet with all of the seats in place. Adjustable pedals are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe regular Yukon gets a standard 285-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 engine; a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 is optional. The Yukon Denali is equipped with a 325-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. The regular Yukon comes with either rear-wheel drive or an automatically engaging four-wheel-drive system called Autotrac. The Yukon Denali has permanently engaged all-wheel drive, and computer-controlled shock absorbers change their stiffness based on driving conditions. All engines work with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage occupant-sensing airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags and GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system are standard on the Denali version and optional on other Yukon models.",

In addition, the SLT trim level gains heated and ventilated front seats finished in perforated leather.\n\n\nLow-speed forward automatic braking is a new option, and the available rear-seat entertainment system adds HDMI and USB ports and supports device projection. The IntelliLink multimedia system adds the Rear Seat Reminder feature while new active grille shutters improve highway aerodynamics.\n\nSignificant Standard Features\n\n355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 with six-speed automatic transmission (SLE, SLT)\nRear-wheel drive\n10-way power driver’s seat\nLED running lights\nIntelliLink multimedia system with 8-inch touchscreen\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nOnStar 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required)\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBackup camera\nFront and rear parking assist\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with eight-speed automatic transmission (Denali)\nPower-folding third-row seat\nPower liftgate\nWireless smartphone charging\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nPower-adjustable pedals\nNavigation system\nBlu-ray/DVD rear entertainment system\nKeyless access with push-button start\nHead-up display\nSafety alert driver’s seat\nLane keep assist\nForward collision warning and low-speed automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nYukon XL\nWhereas the regular Yukon is a twin to the Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV, the Yukon XL is GMC’s version of the Chevrolet Suburban — a king-size SUV.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2014 about the 2015 GMC Yukon. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 GMC Yukon is a massive SUV for those who need hauling capability and like a feeling of spaciousness on the inside. However, if you don’t enjoy a trucklike ride, this probably isn’t the SUV for you.\n\nI grew up in the back of my dad’s Chevrolet Suburban, riding up to the mountains in the winter and out to the lake in the summer — in my Miss Piggy sleeping bag, perched precariously atop the dog kennels in the cargo area. (Seat belts? What seat belts?) Driving the 2015 Yukon certainly offered me a feeling of nostalgia, though with a much more modern, upscale interior.\n\nLike its sister the Chevrolet Tahoe, the Yukon underwent a thorough overhaul for 2015, including some features that busy families will appreciate: a sleeker exterior; an available programmable-height power liftgate; fold-flat second- and third-row seats (with an available power-folding feature); a 110-volt, three-pronged outlet to charge anything you can think of; available keyless entry with push-button start; a conversation mirror to keep an eye on youngsters in the back; a new family of engines that improve gas mileage by nearly 10 percent; and a whole slew of new safety features (see Safety section below). Compare the 2015 and 2014 versions here.\n\nThe Yukon is available in either rear- or four-wheel-drive versions of SLE, SLT and Denali styles. Compare the four-wheel-drive versions side by side here. The Yukon also comes in an extended version, the Yukon XL, which is akin to the Chevrolet Suburban (itself an extended Tahoe). See the regular Yukon and Yukon XL compared side by side here.\n\nIf the Yukon isn’t your cup of tea, you may also want to take the time to research the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada or Toyota Sequoia. See them side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Yukon comes with some nice, modern updates this year. Its slightly squared-off back end, the blingy 20-inch polished aluminum wheels on my SLT test car and a standard rear spoiler give the Yukon a boy-racer-meets-“Man Vs. Wild” look that’s equally at home traversing mountain streams and tackling the rigors of daily carpooling.\n\nWith a step-in height of 22 inches, assist steps on the outside of the Yukon are standard and an absolute must for climbing in and out of this tall beast (illuminated power retractable ones are available on the Denali version). Of course, once you step up onto the running board you’ll need to watch your head under the roofline. It’s not an elegant process for someone of my 5-foot 3-inch stature. My two younger daughters (ages 9 and 11) were short enough to not worry about hitting their heads when using the assist step to climb up and into the SUV.\n\nHow It Drives\nTo me, the Yukon felt very much its size on the road. With such an upscale look and feel to the interior, I guess I was expecting some type of magic to make the Yukon drive more like a car, but that didn’t happen. The rear wheels are almost 2 inches farther apart this year in an attempt to improve cornering performance. However, there was still too much body roll for my comfort, not only in corners but also with just slight steering adjustments. My middle daughter said she liked how it felt soft and comfortable when going straight, but that she felt like she was going to tip over every time we turned. “It feels like riding in a giant wobbly box,” she said. This sensation seems to be more noticeable for passengers than for the driver.\n\nThe Yukon comes with an electric variable assist power steering system that felt quite odd to me. You have to start out muscling the weight of this car into a corner, and then you feel the assist take over and lighten the load. It’s difficult to anticipate and makes it hard to maintain consistent steering feel.\n\nBraking feels as if you’re trying to get a 5,500-pound (plus the weight of my family) beast to come to a stop, despite brake-pedal revisions that were supposed to provide “stronger-feeling, more confident braking performance.” I may have taken a few rolling stops at the beginning of my week in the Yukon before really getting a feel for the distance and force needed to come to a complete stop.\n\nOne area in which I was pleasantly surprised was the Yukon’s maneuverability and better-than-expected 39-foot turning circle. In comparison, the Ford Expedition’s and Nissan Armada’s turning circles are 40.8 feet. The Toyota Sequoia beats the crowd with a turning circle of 38.1 feet.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Yukon’s standard 5.3-liter V-8 engine with active fuel management operates in four-cylinder mode whenever possible to improve fuel economy. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. The two-wheel-drive Yukon with the 5.3-liter engine gets a slight mileage bump, up to a 23 mpg highway rating. Upgrading to a beefier, 6.2-liter engine takes the combined gas mileage down to 16 and 17 mpg for the four-wheel drive and two-wheel drive, respectively — a nearly 10 percent improvement over the 2014 Yukon.\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s interior is plush and comfortable, feeling like a living room on wheels.\n\nAs silly as it may seem, my favorite feature had to be the massive center console that easily swallowed my purse and/or laptop and iPad. Hey, it’s the little things in life that count, right? With a teenage daughter who recently “graduated” to riding in the front seat, I’m feeling increasingly claustrophobic in my test cars, with no place for my stuff. If I stash my purse on the floor in the front, she steps on it. When I put in on the floor in the back, my two younger daughters step on it, spilling the contents into the dark, scary recesses of under-seat hell. In the Yukon, everyone has elbow room to spare, along with plenty of storage to keep their (and my) things tidy and organized.\n\nI also had access to a large, super-secret storage area behind the center touch-screen as well as in-door storage in the front and rear doors. The cupholders in the rear-door armrests were a hit with the kiddos.\n\nMy test vehicle came equipped with second-row captain’s chairs with a huge aisle between them, making the third row easily accessible. I was surprised, however, to see that the seat belts for the captain’s chairs were not height-adjustable. My two younger daughters fit properly in the captain’s chairs with their feet flat on the floor, knees bent over the front edge of the seat and backs up against the backrests, but the seat belts cut quite high on their necks, making me ultimately opt to put them in boosters (much to their dismay). Having such a high seat belt seems inconsistent with the average size of kids, who are likely passengers.\n\nThe third row was totally uncomfortable, even for my kids during short trips. The Yukon’s stadiumlike seating configuration means the third row is raised up a bit on a platform, so even kids’ knees are practically up at chin level. The center seat belt in the third row extends from the roofline, cutting way too high on the neck for comfort or proper fit.\n\nThe available heated and cooled front seats are a great touch, but the seats’ cooling fan is a bit loud, made more noticeable by how quiet the Yukon’s interior otherwise is. Aerodynamic changes for 2015, along with a laminated windshield and front side windows, cut down quite a bit on ambient noise in the SUV. For shoppers seeking even more peace and quiet, the Denali version has active noise-canceling technology inside.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Yukon’s Bluetooth phone and audio system pairs and reconnects seamlessly. The touch-screen panel feels like it should be angled slightly toward the driver for easier access and visibility — though when riding in the passenger seat I appreciated that it was centrally directed so I could operate it as well.\n\nThe air controls were all easy to operate at a quick glance while keeping my eyes on the road — no navigating through multiple menu screens just to turn the fan up, as some modern vehicles require. There are separate controls up front for both front and rear air.\n\nA three-pronged household 120-volt outlet was a nice addition up front.\n\nThe available rear-seat entertainment system ended our love affair with the electronic simplicity we’d found up front. My 11-year-old daughter was super excited to test it out on a longer than usual evening drive, but she couldn’t get a movie to play on her own in the back and I couldn’t help from the front. She bitterly wanted me to note that she thinks GMC tried to make it look fun and easy to use — with a remote with large buttons that looks like a video game remote — but that it’s not easy to use at all. Additionally, the entertainment screen folds down from the roofline, completely blocking my view in the rearview mirror.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo space behind the third row is surprisingly small, at just 15.3 cubic feet. This can expand up to 94.7 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded, but for such a large vehicle I was really expecting more cargo space along with full seating capacity. Even a Mini Countryman beats that number, with 16.5 cubic feet of cargo space with its seats up. This is where the XL version of the Yukon pays off, providing 38.9 cubic feet behind the third row and a total of 121.1 cubic feet — while also increasing third-row legroom from 24.8 to 34.5 inches.\n\nSticking with the shorter models, the Expedition, Sequoia, and Armada have 18.6, 18.9 and 20.0 cubic feet of volume behind their third rows, respectively.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Yukon four-wheel drive has an overall crash-test rating of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This comes from a five-star frontal crash-test rating, a five-star side crash-test rating and a three-star rollover-resistance rating. That lower rollover rating isn’t uncommon for truck-based SUVs, but it’s become rare overall for most SUV models.\n\nGMC has added some pretty interesting new safety features this year, including a standard front center airbag that protects the driver and front passenger from one another in the event of a side crash or rollover. A backup camera is also standard. Forward collision alert, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available, along with an optional safety alert seat that lets the driver know of potential dangers via a slight vibration to the driver’s seat on the side from which the danger is pending. It’s a great feature, as a simple tone alert can easily be drowned out by typical family noise inside a car.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats with a five-point harness in the captain’s chairs is a cinch because you can adjust the back angle of each seat independently, creating a more snug, custom fit for your car seat. Latch anchors in the captain’s chairs of my test car were also visible and easily accessible.\n\nSee all the Yukon’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nRinging in at more than $64,000, my test car hardly seemed like a bargain. For the amount of actual usable space it offers, I’d probably direct my search toward the new Dodge Durango, which would come in well under this price (to the tune of about 20 grand), even fully loaded. However, the four-wheel drive Yukon has a long history of brand loyalty passed from one family member to the next, along with the ability to tow up to 8,500 pounds. This gives it a leg up with active families hauling boats or campers on the weekends.\n\nemail",

The Yukon shares its platform with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and it comes in two sizes: regular and XL, the latter being GMC's version of the Suburban\n\n\nBoth the Yukon and the Yukon XL are available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia.\n\n\nDenali models get a new chrome grille, plus a 10-speed automatic transmission that replaces an eight-speed automatic.\n\nYukon XL\n\nWhereas the regular Yukon is a twin to the Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV, the Yukon XL is GMC’s version of the Chevrolet Suburban — a king-size SUV. The Yukon XL has the same styling and major features of the regular Yukon but offers more cargo room.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nWheelbase is 14 inches longer than Yukon’s\nOverall length is 20.4 inches longer\nMaximum cargo volume is 26.4 cubic feet greater, at 121.1 cubic feet",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2021 GMC Yukon Denali is so good, you’ll wonder why you need to spend more for the new Cadillac Escalade.\nVersus the competition: It’s more spacious than anything from Land Rover, nicer in every way than the latest Lexus LX or Infiniti QX80, and it even gives the lovely Lincoln Navigator a run for its money.\nThe GMC Yukon occupies an unusual place in GM’s lineup of big sport utility vehicles. It’s ostensibly nicer than the Chevrolet Tahoe but not quite as nice as the luxury-branded Cadillac Escalade — and seeing as how it’s nearly identical mechanically to both of those models, sharing everything from engines to suspension bits to seats, that leaves interior and exterior styling as the Yukon’s main differentiator. The Denali trim level further complicates things — it’s GMC’s luxury sub-brand, applied across the board to nearly all products and signifying a top trim level that’s meant to appeal to very specific buyers. Who? People who want luxury but don’t want ostentation, according to GMC. It’s been extremely successful, with a considerable portion of GMC sales now coming in the form of top-spec Denali models.\nSo when the latest full-size GM SUVs got a full-size redo for the 2021 model year, GMC decided to make the Yukon Denali extra-special by giving it a unique interior. I recently took one for a brief spin to see if GMC’s efforts at making the Yukon Denali stand out make it worth its considerable price tag.\nRelated: 2021 GMC Yukon, Yukon XL: Growing in the Right Ways\n\n  \n    \n  \n    All Up in That Grille\nIt’s hard to make three SUVs based on the same body structure look different, but GMC’s designers have managed to accomplish it with a completely different front end than either the Tahoe or the Escalade. And the way they’ve done it is grille — lots of it, huge amounts of it, done up in full chrome treatment on the Denali, just as Denali customers like it. Apparently, the idea of flying under the radar with your luxurious SUV doesn’t apply to the front end, where chrome trim abounds. But the distinctive C-shaped daytime running lights also help the distinctive look of the Yukon, and overall the look is bold and imposing, especially when it appears in the rearview mirror of anyone going too slow in the fast lane on the highway. Down the side, the look isn’t much different from the Tahoe or Escalade, with only some slight variation in chrome trim and badges. Out back, the taillights are similar to the Tahoe, but receive that signature GMC C-channel look that allows for some distinctiveness and separation from its sibling SUVs.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Denali comes with full LED lighting front and back, including foglights. A dual exhaust with dual tips spiffs up the rear bumper area. Specify the Denali Ultimate Package, which my test vehicle had, and you’ll get 22-inch bright machined-aluminum wheels and power retractable side steps. Overall, the look is more formal and less futuristic than the Tahoe, and less minimalist and angular than the Escalade. It’s a good look and fits well into the GMC pantheon of SUVs, helping to distinguish the Yukon appropriately.\nMechanically Identical to Its Kin\nThere aren’t many differences between the top-spec Yukon and the top-spec Tahoe in terms of mechanical bits. The engines are identical, the suspension options are the same, and it’s same brakes, same gearing, same transmissions. As such, your choices are the standard 5.3-liter V-8, optional turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six or the big 6.2-liter V-8 that comes standard with the Denali trim; it makes 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, and it’s the one to have with any of the big GM trucks. All engines are mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission and can be had with either rear-wheel or all-wheel drive.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The all-wheel-drive system is different from the Chevy Tahoe’s in that it includes GMC’s exclusive Active Response 4WD System, (an automatic two-speed transfer case, chassis controls, an electronic limited-slip differential and the Traction Select system that combine to make for a more effortless AWD setup than is seen in the Chevy). As for the powertrain, the big 6.2-liter V-8 is impressive, with smooth, seamless acceleration when called for, accompanied by a growling burble through the dual exhausts that hints at what lies beneath the sculpted hood. It’s as happy trundling around town as cruising the interstates — which you will do at speeds you don’t expect to be traveling at thanks to the extraordinary level of quietness the SUV provides.\nMy test vehicle came with big 22-inch wheels, which normally means a choppy, bumpy ride in a big SUV, but this was mitigated significantly by the presence of both the air spring suspension and Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers. Compared with the Tahoe High Country I tested, the Yukon Denali was significantly quieter, smoother and less choppy — you didn’t feel that the 22-inch wheels were too big for the truck, and not as much of the road imperfections were transmitted into the cabin. I’m a little perplexed as to why the Yukon Denali rides so much more comfortably than the Tahoe High Country given that they both have an air suspension, Magnetic Ride Control and the same size wheels, yet the difference was noticeable. \nOne area that the Yukon hasn’t made any gains in is fuel economy, understandable given the new SUV’s increased weight and carryover engines. The Yukon 4×4 with the 6.2-liter engine is EPA-estimated to get just 14/19/16 mpg city/highway/combined, not as good as the 17/22/19 mpg that the twin-turbo V-6-powered Ford Expedition 4×4 is rated to get, but still better than the 13/19/15 mpg seen in the 5.7-liter V-8-powered Infiniti QX80 AWD. My brief spin in the Yukon was not sufficiently long to get an accurate reading. \nA Unique Interior Environment\nWhere the Yukon separates itself from the Tahoe and Escalade is inside, where two completely different environments are available depending on the trim level you get. The Yukon features the same version of the instrument panel as the Tahoe, albeit with some slightly different trim and color options, but it’s a well-designed, high-quality piece that looks far more appropriate to the price of the vehicle than what GM has stuffed into the pickup trucks that share the same platform. Opt for the Denali, however, and you get a unique dashboard. It’s even nicer than the base dashboards, featuring a 10-inch multimedia screen that looks much more integrated into the dash than the tablet-style mount found in the other trim levels and on the Tahoe. \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The quality of the cabin is a considerable step up from prior GMC Denali interiors of any type on any model, which felt barely any different than lesser trims, just presented in an alternate color. In the new Denali, the unique dashboard with its stitched leather trim, real metal accents, real wood veneers, and high-quality buttons and switches give it the premium feel that its price commands. The trick sliding center console storage box is also present, activated by a switch hidden amongst the rather confusing moonroof controls (they’re tricky to operate on the fly, as you can’t easily determine which button does what without direct examination). The console seems a good place to stash illicit items, at least until the local constabulary get wind of how the system works.\nThe vehicle is very quiet at speed thanks to thicker laminated glass up front than is present in the Tahoe, one of the few areas of differentiation that customers don’t actually see but that become evident when sampling the two. \nThe rest of the interior shows the same versatility and comfort present in the Tahoe, with seats that are easy to fold or slide, and far more room in each of the second- and third-row positions than prior Yukons. Credit the new independent rear suspension and expanded dimensions inside and out that have allowed GMC engineers to reconfigure the Yukon’s interior packaging to allow for far greater comfort than was available before. Full-size humans can fit in the third row without any problem, and getting in and out is a breeze thanks to the tilt-and-fold mechanism on the second-row captain’s chairs in the Denali. All of those seats are covered in perforated leather, and the second row is heated as well.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The interior isn’t perfect. We’re still not decided on if we like the push-button transmission, but it seems better than most to use, and we like that it’s mounted up high on the dash for easy viewing, not low down where it’s out of sight. The rearview mirror is smallish, as well, considering the size of the rear window it has to cover. But these are small quibbles in what is otherwise a dynamite execution of an improved luxury SUV interior. It easily surpasses the top Platinum trim for the Ford Expedition and gives a good showing against the more posh Lincoln Navigator, and its modern amenities shame the aged Infiniti QX80 and related Nissan Armada. The interior is so good, you’ll wonder why you need to spend even more money on the upcoming Cadillac Escalade — until you see what Cadillac has in store regarding dashboard technology that will make even the Yukon Denali look like yesterday’s news, anyway.\nPriced as Expected — High\nThe latest big SUVs are not the bargains they once were, as top technology, lighter-weight materials, luxury trimmings, reduced demand from their heyday of the 1990s and a refocusing on specific customers have all conspired to drive prices well beyond reason. The base price for a new 2021 GMC Yukon Denali is $72,695 (prices include destination). My test vehicle had the Denali Ultimate Package that includes a rear media system, power assist steps, dual-pane panoramic moonroof, 22-inch wheels, adaptive cruise control, air suspension, rear camera mirror with camera washer, trailering package and more for an eye-popping $11,180. A few other odds and ends brought the as-tested price up to $83,720, which is definitely luxury SUV territory. \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    … Or at least it would be, if it wasn’t also possible to option up a Chevy Tahoe or Ford Expedition or even an ancient Toyota Sequoia to north of 70 grand. But the Yukon’s mission to provide a luxury brand option to people who don’t want the ostentation and flash of a Cadillac yet feel that they’re above the mass-market image of a Chevrolet seems to be a solid one. Ford has only the two options, luxury (Lincoln Navigator) and nonluxury (Ford Expedition); so does Nissan (Armada and Infiniti QX80). Toyota doesn’t sell a Lexus-branded version of the Sequoia; if you want a big luxury Lexus SUV, your option is the LX 570, which is a horrifically expensive, rebadged Toyota Land Cruiser that starts at some $93,000 for a three-row version.\nThe progress made here is that the Yukon Denali finally feels like a proper luxury vehicle, with a smoothness, quietness and sophistication that’s been lacking in prior versions. If the price doesn’t scare you, the SUV itself should certainly satisfy you. \nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2009 GMC Yukon is the middle child among GM’s full-size SUVs. Based on price and equipment, the Yukon sits squarely between the Chevrolet Tahoe and Cadillac Escalade. Four-wheel drive is available on the Yukon, as are seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Competitors include the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nThe Yukon Hybrid and Yukon XL are covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe 2009 Yukon receives increased power and fuel efficiency, with a new six-speed automatic transmission and an enhanced 6.2-liter V-8 that can run on E85. A third-row seat is standard on all models, and there is an optional rearview-mirror-integrated camera system.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon has a one-piece grille and taller headlights than its sister Tahoe, with jewel-like bezels and a wider, lower air dam. The rest of the body features blocky fenders, long rear-quarter windows and a squared-off back end. The Yukon is also available in a higher-end Denali trim level. Denali models come with 20-inch wheels, chrome exterior moldings and a power-operated rear liftgate.\n\nAt 202 inches long and 79 inches wide, the Yukon is a bit shorter than the Expedition and Sequoia but about the same width.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nIntegrated running boards\nStandard 17-inch aluminum wheels\nStandard power, heated side mirrors\nOptional 20-inch aluminum or chrome-plated aluminum wheels\nChrome grille (Denali edition)\nOptional articulating running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon’s dashboard has the same shape as its redesigned GM siblings. That’s good news because the domed instrument panel, car-like dashboard and flush-mounted buttons are a vast improvement on the rectangular fixtures of previous Yukons.\n\nThis SUV has the ability to seat up to nine occupants when benches are placed in all three rows. Uplevel models replace first- and second-row benches with captain’s chairs, lowering total seating capacity to seven. The second-row seats fold forward, either manually or via an available power mechanism. The third row is removable, but it doesn’t fold flat to the floor as some competitors’ seats do. New for 2009 is standard third-row seating on all models.\n\nWith both rows stashed away, maximum cargo volume is 108.9 cubic feet, which places the Yukon in between the Expedition and Sequoia.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nStandard XM Satellite Radio with real-time traffic and route advisements\nAvailable cloth, vinyl or leather-appointed seats\nOptional power fold-and-tumble second row\nNewly available integrated rear camera in rearview mirror\nNewly available heated/cooled seats (Denali models)\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon can be had with either rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have an all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon.\n\nNew additions for 2009 include an integrated brake controller, which provides proper brake force signaling to a trailer’s brake systems, and a heavy-duty trailering package that gives the Yukon a new maximum towing capacity. When properly equipped, the Yukon can now tow up to 8,500 pounds.\n\nPowertrain features include:\n\n295-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 with 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque and an available cylinder-deactivation system\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic (4.8-liter) or six-speed automatic (5.3- and 6.2-liter)\nNew fuel-saving 3.08:1 axle ratio\nOptional variable load-leveling suspension\nPower rack-and-pinion steering\n\nSafety\nNew safety options include a blind-zone alert system, rear parking assist and a rearview camera system that’s integrated into the rearview mirror.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSide-mounted thorax airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability control with traction control\nOnStar with one year of Directions & Connections plan, which provides voice-guided directions, automatic crash response and Bluetooth hands-free calling",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe GMC Yukon is a full-size three-row SUV available in regular- and extended-length form (called the Yukon XL). Engine choices include a pair of gas V-8s and a turbo-diesel inline-six-cylinder. All engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\n\nThe Yukon and Yukon XL are related to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, respectively, and Yukon competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. The AT4 trim offers standard and available features aimed at improved off-road capability. Denali trims offer a higher level of luxury — with a price tag to match: The range-topping Denali Ultimate has a more expensive starting price than some trim levels of the Cadillac Escalade. GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving assist is standard on the Denali Ultimate and included in an Advanced Technology Package on the Denali. \n\nThe Yukon offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.9 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nAfter gaining the range-topping Denali Ultimate trim for 2023, the Yukon and Yukon XL see no significant changes for 2024. Both vehicles are expected to receive a substantial refresh for the 2025 model year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 GMC Yukon Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nCloth upholstery\n10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n20- or 22-inch wheels \nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nHands-free power liftgate\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-sliding front center console\nBose premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAir suspension\nSuper Cruise driving-assist system\nShould I Buy the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Yukon is a refined full-size SUV with a versatile and comfortable interior. The available 6.2-liter V-8 engine is a powerful performer, and this big SUV rides well. The Denali and Denali Ultimate are expensive, but they offer a higher level of luxury and truly distinctive trim inside and out. With the exception of the Denali Ultimate, the related Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban are only a little less expensive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe 2019 GMC Yukon is an SUV that can seat up to nine (when equipped with a front bench seat on SLE trim levels). It comes standard with a 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission. A 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 working with a 10-speed automatic transmission is available. The extended-length Yukon XL is nearly 2 feet longer than the regular-length Yukon, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions of both are offered. Competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 GMC Yukon?\n\nA new Graphite Edition for the SLT trim level features 22-inch wheels, black assist steps, a black-chrome grille insert, gloss-black accents and GMC’s Z85 suspension. A Graphite Performance Edition is also available for the SLT, including the 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic, black 22-inch wheels, digital instrumentation, a head-up display, a trailer-brake controller, a 3.23 axle ratio and Magnetic Ride Control.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 GMC Yukon Are Most Important?\n\nShoppers in search of maximum passenger space and cargo room should think about stepping up to the bigger Yukon XL, which delivers on both fronts. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are included with the standard 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, and 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) means your family can stay connected on the go. Available advanced safety features include forward collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam headlights and lane-keeping assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 GMC Yukon?\n\nIf you’re looking for a full-size SUV to tow your family — or a boat or camper — where you need to go, the Yukon can do that job. Downsides include ride quality, handling, cargo room in the regular-length Yukon and a lack of interior differentiation from its Chevrolet siblings. We’d recommend checking out the Expedition, as well, to see which best suits your needs.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2006 about the Denali version of the 2007 GMC Yukon. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2007 GMC Yukon — along with the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Tahoe — is one of three completely redesigned full-size SUVs from General Motors. I’ve driven all three, and with the exception of the Escalade’s more powerful drivetrain and cushier ride, they’re almost identical.\n\nWhile I may not agree with building three versions of essentially the same vehicle, there are many brand loyalists who will always buy a GMC or a Chevy, while others desire the cachet of the Cadillac. I’d always advise picking the one that costs less; in this case, the Chevy Tahoe. For once it’s also easy to recommend the Yukon to anyone in need of a vehicle that fits six and has strong towing capabilities.\n\nExterior\nPainted black and trimmed in chrome, my Yukon Denali test vehicle looked more like its Escalade corporate cousin than a tough truck. The Yukon is probably the safest-looking of the three siblings, with chrome used tastefully in all the right places. The Tahoe is a bit more aggressive and the Escalade more chromified. In black, the Yukon looks like it could shuttle either foreign dignitaries or rap stars, and maintains a look as elegant as any vehicle this big can manage.\n\nMost noticeable to anyone approaching the Yukon are its huge, square headlamps and chrome mesh grille. It’s a look that says “big” and not much else, but at least it’s making a statement. The rest of the Yukon’s look is generic. Although it’s all too easy to make something this large look ugly, the Yukon never crosses into that unappealing territory. If you’re trying to make a style statement, though, either the Tahoe with its more aggressive front end or the Escalade with its intricate grillwork would be the way to go. If you don’t want to be noticed, pick the Yukon.\n\nRide & Handling\nWhenever I approach a vehicle this large I bring along the expectation that it will be hard to maneuver. In the Yukon I was surprisingly sure of myself, even on the tightest city streets. Not only was the girth manageable, but I immediately discovered where the corners were, and the rear-mounted camera helped when I backed up. The Yukon was more intuitive to park than many midsize SUVs I’ve tested.\n\nThat same good sense of space kept me properly inside lanes on the highway and confident when moving in traffic. Still, the Yukon is extremely top heavy — as are most players in this segment — and there was considerable body roll on off-ramps.\n\nAs comfortable as the thick leather seats were, the ride itself could have been a bit cushier and quieter. Joints in the highway were extremely noticeable; the Yukon was much better at absorbing bumps and other road abnormalities at lower speeds. The rough highway ride was surprising because of the Yukon Denali’s very fancy variable shock dampening system. There’s a noticeable improvement in ride and road noise when you move to the Escalade.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe biggest drawback I found with the Yukon was the powertrain. A 380-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 is standard in the Denali, but it was sluggish in almost every passing situation I could simulate. The top power found in the regular Yukon range is a 320-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. That engine also has a fuel management system that shuts off four cylinders when they’re not needed, improving gas mileage.\n\nOn the highway, the Denali’s engine strained to pass both semis and the more common Sunday driver. Going from cruising speed to passing momentum meant enduring a long and slow climb through the revs, even with the foot depressed solidly on the accelerator.\n\nAround town I was constantly applying the wrong pressure to the gas pedal. The transmission was counterintuitive at every turn and left me feeling like a 17-year-old who just got his license as I routinely jerked my passengers. Overall mileage was pretty impressive, remaining in the mid- to high teens throughout the week of testing; I logged around 300 miles, all on one tank. GM rates the Denali at 13/19 mpg city/hwy. The Yukon with the 6.0-liter V-8 and Active Fuel Management gets 16/22 mpg, which is exceptional for a vehicle this large and would be my choice.\n\nBraking was adequate, but with such a big machine I would have preferred more pinpoint control. The Denali was easy to slow at varying speeds in bumper-to-bumper traffic — something I learned thanks to the idiocy of other drivers who believed the space I intentionally left in front of me was large enough for them to squeeze into. I was actually leaving the proper buffer zone for an emergency stop in the SUV, but at least I learned how well the Denali could brake on a dime without causing a larger traffic jam.\n\nThe Inside\nHere’s where GM has really outdone itself in its new SUVs. Like the Tahoe, the Yukon shows off one of the best interiors GM has ever mustered in a mass-marketed vehicle. All the buttons are of above-average quality, and the environment and stereo controls are ergonomically perfect.\n\nThe front and middle seats were extremely comfortable and supportive. They were also extremely wide, to accommodate the ever-expanding American waistline. My passengers enjoyed the backseat accommodations, with their own environment controls and captain’s chair accoutrements. The third row of seats came in handy for a day of house hunting in the suburbs with realtor, in-laws and wife aboard. My 5-foot-6-inch wife, who drew the short straw, thought the third-row seat was comfortable but that foot room was nonexistent. I wouldn’t advise trying to squeeze three people onto it, despite GM saying the Yukon fits seven. We also didn’t discover the handy button that automatically flips the second-row seat forward, allowing access to the rear row, until after the day’s jaunt was finished.\n\nThe test Yukon Denali also came with a DVD entertainment system in front of the second row of seats so both rear rows could view it. Up front, the stereo featured XM Satellite Radio and a CD player. One brand-new CD we inserted didn’t get past the first song before it skipped horribly. A different and well-played disc performed without incident. Sound from the upgraded Bose system was adequate, but felt unnatural and seemed to come from far ahead of the dash despite numerous adjustments to the audio settings. Perhaps that serves as a buffer for rear passengers who are watching DVDs.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2007 Yukon a five-star frontal crash-test rating; it hasn’t done a side-impact test as of this writing. Rollover ratings were listed at three stars, which means in a single-vehicle crash the Yukon has a 22 – 24 percent chance of rolling over. That’s about average for SUVs of this class. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet rated the Yukon or any other new full-size SUV.\n\nThe Yukon Denali is equipped with plenty of safety features, including side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. It has four-wheel antilock brakes, stability control and a rollover mitigation system. All wheel drive is also standard.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe Yukon Denali is a spacious three-row SUV for people, but that’s it. If there are six people and no cargo, the Yukon is a terrific place to be. If you have a lot of cargo — you know, like luggage — that rear row has to be removed, and by removed we mean taken out. The popular fold-flat seats we’re seeing in most other SUVs didn’t make their way into this design, which makes the Yukon’s overall usefulness suffer. The third row of seats does flip forward to add some room, but it won’t impress owners of smaller five-passenger SUVs. Then you’re back to carrying four people.\n\nWe also performed the dog test with the Denali, and our 2-year-old boxer didn’t like either the second-row captain’s chairs or the small amount of flat floor space that could be created in the second-row area. The chairs were too high for her when we took a turn, causing her to fall off, and the flat floor was too cramped even with the second-row seats flipped forward. While this isn’t a must for all buyers, dog lovers can definitely cross this vehicle off their list.\n\nThe Yukon Denali is rated to tow 7,100 pounds — a decent amount, but nothing that gives it a decided advantage over the competition. More serious haulers will likely stick to four-door pickups that can handle larger loads.\n\nFeatures\nThe Denali comes with a long list of standard equipment to please passengers: Heated leather front seats, a Bose stereo with a six-disc CD changer, XM Satellite Radio and a three-zone air-conditioning system make both short and long drives enjoyable. For the driver, the power-folding side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, a heated washing system for de-icing the windshield, a remote starter, adjustable pedals and a tire pressure monitoring system help seal the deal.\n\nOur tester had more than $6,000 in options added on to its $47,115 price. Some, like the rear entertainment system ($1,295) and power sunroof ($995), were welcome. I would not, however, opt for the 20-inch chrome wheels ($1,995) or the navigation system ($2,145). While I would never pay for a nav system in any vehicle, this one actually got us lost on our way home from an out-of-town trip and never correctly found the street address we were headed to, despite displaying it as a known address.\n\nYukon Denali in the Market\nIf you have a boat, trailer or anything that needs to be towed, the GMC Yukon Denali is a great way to travel. It’s even better if you have a family. Yes, the country is in a panic over gas prices, but there’s no other way to tow large cargo and fit six people in so much comfort and style. Just make sure to put your luggage in the trailer.\n\nOpting for the base Yukon instead of the Denali saves a bit both at the bank and the pump; the mileage is extremely good for a full-size SUV, and its towing ability is another deciding factor. For those drivers who just need a people-mover, the tried and true minivan or a large crossover like the Chrysler Pacifica and upcoming GMC Acadia are more practical and efficient.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe GMC Yukon is a full-size three-row SUV available in regular- and extended-length form (called XL). Engine choices include a pair of gas V-8s, as well as a turbo-diesel inline-six. All engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\n\nThe Yukon and Yukon XL are related to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, respectively, and Yukon competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. The AT4 trim offers standard and available features aimed at improved off-road capability. Denali trims offer a higher level of luxury — with a price tag to match: The new range-topping Denali Ultimate has a more expensive starting price than some trim levels of the Cadillac Escalade. The Yukon offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.9 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Denali Ultimate debuts as the most opulent Yukon to date, with standard luxury features like upgraded leather upholstery and interior trim, massaging front seats and an 18-speaker Bose audio system. Though its availability is limited, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving assist is standard on the Denali Ultimate and included in an Advanced Technology Package on the Denali.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 GMC Yukon Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nCloth upholstery\n10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nHands-free power liftgate\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-sliding front center console\nBose premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAir suspension\nSuper Cruise driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Yukon is a refined full-size SUV with a versatile and comfortable interior. The available 6.2-liter V-8 engine is a powerful performer, and this big SUV rides well. The Denali and Denali Ultimate are expensive, but they offer a higher level of luxury and truly distinctive trim inside and out. With the exception of the Denali Ultimate, the related Tahoe and Suburban are a little less expensive, but not by much.",
