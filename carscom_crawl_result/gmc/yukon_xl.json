      "expert_review": "The 2015 GMC Yukon XL Denali is a powerful full-size SUV with seating for up to eight, but the cabin isn’t distinct enough from its Chevrolet siblings to warrant its luxury-class price tag.\n\nGM redesigned its family of full-size SUVs for the 2015 model year, giving them a stronger frame, new V-8 engines, boxier exterior styling and richer interiors (to see the 2015 and 2014 Yukon XL compared, click here). The regular Yukon and extended-length Yukon XL are positioned between the mass-market Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and the luxury-oriented Cadillac Escalade in GM’s lineup. Outside the GM family, the Yukon XL competes with the Ford Expedition EL (see their specs compared here).\n\nWe tested a four-wheel-drive Yukon XL Denali, which is an upscale version of the Yukon XL SLE and SLT that gets a more powerful 6.2-liter V-8 engine and different styling cues, like a unique chrome grille. It starts at $71,415, including a $1,195 destination charge, but optional features brought our as-tested price to $78,725.\n\nExterior & Styling\nDespite the Yukon XL’s boxier appearance, GMC says the SUV is more aerodynamic than its predecessor. The chiseled look suits this big SUV well, though, and the upright grille styling is a big improvement over the prior model’s cartoonish shape.\n\nDenali models get a mesh-style chrome grille that looks quite a bit different from the regular Yukon XL’s horizontal-bar design. Other changes include high-intensity-discharge headlights and standard 20-inch aluminum alloy wheels. The overall look, though, is more bold than elegant.\n\nHow It Drives\nRefinement has been happening in all corners of the automotive world, including the full-size truck and SUV segments. The GMC Yukon XL is a prime example of this, reflecting how small the driving-experience gap has become with full-size car-based crossovers.\n\nThis refinement comes across in a few ways. The GMC Yukon XL is composed on the highway and easy to steer. It’s quiet, too, with just a hint of wind noise at highway speeds. Overall, it has an easy-driving way about it that seems ideal for long family road trips.\n\nDenali models have GM’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension. The system is very good at limiting body motions — both body roll when cornering and also bobbing movements on rolling pavement. Compared with the non-adaptive suspension other trims have, however, ride quality over smaller bumps and pavement breaks is harsh; you feel every irregularity, and on rougher pavement it makes for a bumpy ride.\n\nAccording to a GM representative, the Magnetic Ride Control shocks were scheduled to be improved in late 2014 to make them less sensitive to small road irregularities. Our test model was built in June 2014, however, so we weren’t able to experience the updated calibration that should now be in Denali models on dealer lots.\n\nA 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine is standard in the Yukon XL, but the Denali version gets a 6.2-liter V-8 rated at 420 hp. The extra power is welcome; the 6.2-liter V-8 gets the Yukon XL up to highway speeds quickly and provides strong around-town acceleration. The Denali model weighs about three tons, but the 6.2-liter V-8 doesn’t feel burdened.\n\nOur test model had a six-speed automatic transmission. While you may be able to buy a new Yukon XL Denali with this transmission, it’s more likely that ones on dealer lots now will have a new eight-speed automatic transmission that became available in November 2014 as a late change for the 2015 model year.\n\nEPA-estimated gas mileage for the four-wheel-drive Yukon XL Denali remains 14/20/16 mpg city/highway/combined with the new transmission, but rear-wheel-drive versions gain 1 mpg on the highway for a 15/22/17 mpg estimate. GM says the eight-speed automatic’s shifts are quicker, and a new torque converter provides smoother low-speed performance.\n\nAs for the six-speed automatic, I like how it works with the 6.2-liter V-8s. It’s very responsive, kicking down quickly when you need more power. We’ve been impressed with the eight-speed’s pairing with the 6.2-liter engine in GM’s full-size pickup trucks, so the change bodes well for the Yukon Denali.\n\nInterior\nThe Yukon XL Denali has the same cabin layout as non-Denali models, but it gets nicer standard materials, like real wood trim and premium leather seats. There are many soft-touch materials, the controls are nicely arranged and the styling is eye-pleasing, but the overall look is too similar to the Chevrolet Tahoe’s interior.\n\nThe front bucket seats have soft seat cushions, but backrest cushioning is quite firm. Many people like the elevated driving position SUVs provide, and the Yukon XL delivers; you sit up high and can look over cars in front of you. Optional power-retracting running boards make it easier to climb inside.\n\nThere’s enough legroom in the second row to stretch your legs a bit, and the seating position is comfortable. The optional second-row captain’s chairs don’t slide forward or backward, but their backrests recline. Like the front seats, the second-row chairs have soft seat cushions and firm backrests. They tumble forward to make a wide walk-through to the third row, but you can also walk between them.\n\nThe Yukon XL’s extra length — about 20 inches longer than a regular Yukon — goes a long way toward improving passenger comfort in the third row. Unlike the Ford Expedition, which offers exceptional third-row seat comfort, the regular Yukon’s third row is unusable for adults because legroom is extremely limited. The Yukon XL remedies that with an extra 9.7 inches of third-row legroom for a total of 34.5 inches. It’s considerably more comfortable despite the hard seat cushioning.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nControls are sensibly arranged and easy to use. GMC is wise to steer clear of the capacitive touch-sensitive button fad, which appears to be in its last days, but some of the Yukon XL’s physical buttons, like the ones for the heated seats, could be larger so they’re easier to use. Unlike many other full-size SUVs that have console shifters, the Yukon XL has its shifter on the steering column. This lets the base trim level seat up to nine people with an available first-row bench seat, and the design also frees up space for additional console storage.\n\nDenali trim levels get a unique instrument panel with an 8-inch color display between the tachometer and speedometer. The screen has a few themes and can show different kinds of vehicle information, like what song is playing on the radio, trip info or a redundant navigation map. The secondary map is a nice feature, but GM doesn’t utilize the screen to its full potential; the map takes up just a portion of the screen even though there’s room for a much larger image.\n\nThe standard IntelliLink multimedia system has an 8-inch touch-screen that recognizes smartphone-style gestures like swiping to view different information. Physical buttons located below the display supplement the on-screen menus. At the tap of a button, the screen motors up to reveal a hidden compartment and one of five standard USB ports. An MP3 jack and an SD card slot are also included.\n\nThe system paired easily with my iPhone using Bluetooth and quickly loaded all my contacts. The Bluetooth feature includes streaming audio for playing music stored on your phone; song names appear on the touch-screen and you can skip through your music using screen controls.\n\nThe GMC Yukon XL gained 4G LTE internet connectivity in late 2014, making the SUV a rolling Wi-Fi hotspot for tablets and other mobile devices. GMC includes a three-month/3-gigabyte data trial through OnStar.\n\nCargo & Storage\nAnother benefit of the Yukon XL’s extra length is considerably more cargo room behind the third row. The regular Yukon has just 15.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, while the Yukon XL has 38.9 cubic feet. Maximum cargo room with the second and third rows folded is 121.1 cubic feet — a little less than the Expedition EL’s 130.8 cubic feet. You have to clear the GMC Yukon XL’s high bumper when loading cargo.\n\nThe Yukon XL has lots of space for smaller items thanks to tiered door pockets, small cubbies along the center console, the hidden compartment behind the touch-screen and a big center console storage bin that’s large enough to hold a laptop computer. The glove box, however, is small.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety weren’t available as of publication, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2015 Yukon and Yukon XL an overall rating of four out of five stars. Regular- and long-wheelbase versions of the Expedition received five stars overall.\n\nBesides traditional front-seat side-impact airbags, there’s a side-impact airbag on the inboard side of the driver’s bucket seat that’s designed to prevent front passengers from hitting each other in a crash.  A backup camera and front and rear parking sensors are standard.\n\nOptional advanced safety features include a blind spot warning system; lane departure warning; forward collision warning; rear cross-traffic alert; adaptive cruise control with automatic braking; and GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which issues driver warnings through seat-cushion pulses.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Yukon XL, check out our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nBig SUVs like the GMC Yukon XL come with big price tags to match; the SUV starts at more than $50,000, and in Denali form it can cost as much as full-size luxury body-type SUVs like the Lincoln Navigator, Infiniti QX80 and Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. While nicely appointed, the Yukon XL Denali doesn’t ooze luxury like some of those models do.\n\nIt is less ostentatious, though, and that’s resonated with SUV shoppers; GMC says more than 60 percent of all Yukon sales are Denali models. That’s impressive, and it will be interesting to see how GMC evolves the Denali formula in the years ahead.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "GMC has been making earnest noises about differentiating the Yukon and Yukon XL from their Chevy roommates, the Tahoe and Suburban. But so far, that effort has amounted to slight cosmetic differences. What we’re left with, finally, is two General Motors Corp. divisions selling the same lucrative and excellent vehicle.\n\nMy previous weeklong testing of the recently redesigned Suburban/Yukon XL ute had been limited to the 1500 series. The 1500, or half-ton, model is the one most people buy. It rides well and delivers a generous amount of power, payload and towing ability.\n\nBut this time, I tested the beastie boy: the Yukon XL 2500, or three-quarter-ton model.\n\nThe 2500 is for people with serious hauling or towing needs, people who want to pull a heavy boat, camper or horse trailer. The 2500 I tested had a towing capacity of 10,100 pounds. That’s more than 5 tons.\n\nIn order to do that kind of work, the 2500 comes with a substantially larger engine.\n\nThe base engine in the 1500 is a 275-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8. The power plant in the 2500 I tested was a huge, 6-liter V-8 with enough torque to drag Mount Rushmore to a new home. (How big is this engine? Well, a smiling GM public relations man once told me that every time the company wants to build another one, it has to open a new iron mine.)\n\nThe new 2500 complements that hefty engine with an equally meaty base price of $38,948. But, when you consider the work this vehicle will do, its extensive standard equipment litany, and the prices they charge for sport utes in general, I think it is a very fair window sticker.\n\nAs a result of its capacity for work, the new 2500 doesn’t ride quite as well as the 1500. This is because the 1500 has a new coil-spring suspension for the back wheels, while the 2500 must continue to use the stiffer, semielliptical rear springs in order to carry and tow more.\n\nWhile these leaf springs don’t pamper as well as the coils, the 2500 is still not a bad ride. Its superlong wheelbase (130 inches) and considerable structural strength translate into reasonable comfort. In the case of the test vehicle, the 2500’s ride was further enhanced by an optional new “Autoride” system that instantly adjusts the shock absorbers to meet changing road conditions. This remarkable road smoother isn’t cheap at $790, but it would be worth it to me, particularly if I planned to spend any time off road.\n\nGoing off road also means getting the 2500 with the new “Autotrac” four-wheel-drive system instead of the base, rear-drive layout. Autotrac allows you to lock into four-wheel-drive for serious off-road use, or employ a mode that conveniently deals with changing on-road traction conditions by automatically shifting back and forth from rear to four-wheel-drive.\n\nBecause of its size, the Yukon XL is not at home on narrow city streets. But it is in its element on the highway. When you couple the tester’s acceptable ride with its three rows of comfortable leather seats and generous cargo area, you find yourself with a pretty good vacationmobile.\n\nI used it on a trip that included four adults and two children. There was plenty of room for the folks and their luggage. The nice thing about three rows of seats is that you can put the kiddies in different rows and minimize border skirmishes.",

      "expert_review": "About 15 years ago, something interesting happened: Buyers of big, ostentatious luxury SUVs started making a different choice, eschewing the big, glitzy, popular Cadillac Escalade for the GMC Yukon instead. It offered almost everything buyers wanted in a full-size luxury SUV without the need to explain why they were buying a Cadillac during the Great Recession. Sure, it was still expensive, thirsty and just plain yuge, but it was also a bit of a stealth move to fly under the radar of other peoples’ ire. And the birth of the Denali sub-brand took off. That trend happily continues with the 2025 Yukon and even gets built upon by a more off-road-ready version of GMC’s big luxobarge. I got an in-person look at the new Yukon ahead of its reveal to the public.\n\nRelated: 2025 GMC Yukon: Big Is Beautiful\n\nIt Certainly Looks Good\n\nThe Yukon’s styling has always been attractive, and the latest update only improves upon its looks. It’s fun that you can get two different versions — either go the luxury route down the Denali hole or go the off-road path via the AT4 trail. I’m not entirely sure how many Yukon AT4 buyers are actually going too far off-road in their nearly $74,000 (including destination) SUVs (that’s the least expensive version of the 2024 Yukon AT4), but the thing certainly has the equipment to do so. Adding in the new AT4 Ultimate trim level is fun, but it will almost certainly be eye-wateringly expensive.\n\nBut being able to get the turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine in any of the Yukon’s trims makes it even more compelling — especially since it’s being discontinued in the Escalade for 2025. So if you want a redesigned Escalade with the diesel, you’re out of luck, but thankfully the Yukon Denali is nearly as nice, not quite as overburdened with the Escalade’s new screen fetish and can still be had with the extraordinary oil-burner motor.\n\nNo Screen Fetish\n\nAh yes, the screen fetish of the Escalade — it’s not seen here in the Yukon. Yes, there’s a massive new central 16.8-inch vertically oriented touchscreen that dominates the entire center console, but it looks good and doesn’t put every function behind the glass. There are still buttons and knobs for high-use items like audio and climate controls, which is something to be celebrated as they minimize distractions for drivers as they’re operating the vehicle.\n\nThe switch to the Google-based operating system for all vehicle voice and multimedia controls is something we’re less thrilled about, however, as our experience with Google systems has been decidedly mixed. If there’s weak or no data connection between the car and the cloud (which would happen if you’re overlanding your Yukon AT4 Ultimate across the vast, empty stretches of the American Southwest), you’ll find yourself frustratingly without a lot of simple voice-command functions, like changing radio stations.\n\nThe rest of the Yukon’s interior feels as good as those in all of the new GM vehicles; it’s opulent, well thought out, comfortable and very usable. The new dashboard makes a huge difference as well; just like in the Chevy Tahoe, it’s considerably lower than the prior model’s, dramatically improving forward visibility over the Yukon’s tall hood. The Yukon no longer has a high-mounted screen thanks to the deep vertical display that further improves outward views. And like prior versions, the second- and third-row seats are eminently comfortable and usable. Yukons are huge — there’s no way around that — but this is the reason people buy them.\n\nFor those wishing to have a more traditional American luxury full-size SUV experience without the increasingly space-age, screen-based push coming for the next Escalade, the Yukon makes an excellent case for itself.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nGMC Teases 2025 Yukon, Shows Exterior Refresh\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban: Smoother Super-Sized SUVs\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 GMC Yukon?\n2021 GMC Yukon Denali Review: Finally, the Denali Is Different\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada, Toyota Sequoia\n\nLooks like: A GMC Sierra 1500 pickup truck’s nose with an SUV’s body\n\nPowertrain: 5.3-liter V-8, 6.2-liter V-8 or turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder; 10-speed automatic transmission; rear- or four-wheel drive available\n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2020\n\nThe redesigned 2021 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL have appeared, and the pair of related SUVs — the XL being an extended-length take on the Yukon — sees upgrades in every regard, with added technology, passenger and cargo room, suspension improvements and new powertrains.\n\nRelated: 2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: The General Did Its Homework\n\nParent company GM redesigned the Yukon’s close relatives, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, for 2021, and the Chevrolet SUVs share powertrains and some interior features with the GMCs. Whether the Yukon has done enough to differentiate itself as the more luxurious of the two models remains to be seen, but it’s worth noting that upscale Denali editions get a different dashboard design. Still, it will be hard to tell until we can get inside.\n\nAlso offered for the first time on the Yukon will be an off-road-oriented AT4 model. That aligns with GMC’s plans to offer an AT4 version of all models by the end of 2020.\n\nExterior\n\nThe nose of the new Yukon will look familiar to those acquainted with GMC’s full-size pickup truck, the Sierra 1500. GM seems to have lifted front styling for the Yukon Denali and AT4 directly from respective versions of the Sierra 1500, but I don’t mind. It’s a handsome getup that looks both rugged and a little ostentatious, which fits with how GMC is marketed.\n\nExterior dimensions have grown, especially for the non-XL Yukon. It’s 6.1 inches longer overall, with a 4.9-inch increase in wheelbase. The Yukon XL is still some 15 inches longer than its regular-length sibling, but its growth spurt is smaller. The wheelbase is up 4.1 inches over the outgoing Yukon XL, and overall length is up only about an inch.\n\nInterior\n\nRemember what we just said about the similarities to the Sierra 1500 pickup? Those end inside. The Yukon gets its own interior styling and technology, which looks to be a significant upgrade over the Sierra’s interior — the weak link on an otherwise solid truck. The Yukon’s cabin looks similar to that of the Tahoe and Suburban, whose interiors impressed us in our first look.\n\nGMC offered little information in the way of standard features, so we don’t yet know screen sizes for the multimedia system and instrument cluster — though it’s likely they’ll match the Tahoe’s and Suburban’s 10-inch screens. The Yukon will offer an optional 15-inch diagonal head-up display plus an optional power sliding center console. The latter can slide up to 10 inches to open up a flat storage area with a hidden storage compartment that can store valuables more securely.\n\nDenali models don’t just get dressier colors or materials; they get a completely different dashboard and instruments, plus unique seats, color themes and hand-cut leather. The multimedia screen sits lower in the dash with air vents above it — opposite from the high-mounted orientation you’ll find in the other Yukons.\n\nThe increase in dimensions pays big dividends for cargo and passenger room, especially in the Yukon. Third-row legroom is up more than 10 inches, which should make it suitable for adults finally. We’ve found manufacturer-stated cargo specs an unreliable measure of reality, but on paper GM appears to have made big gains. Space behind the third-row is now 25.5 cubic feet (up 10.2 cubic feet) and maximum cargo room is now 122.9 cubic feet (up 28.2 cubic feet). Gains on the Yukon XL are more modest, though it was already rather large to begin with. Rear legroom is now 36.7 inches (up 2.2 inches) and maximum cargo room is now 144.7 cubic feet, with 41.1 cubic feet of space behind the third row. Those are up 23.0 and 1.8 cubic feet, respectively. Beyond the gains in third-row space is easier access, thanks to 5.5 inches of seat travel from sliding second-row seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThere are three available powertrains: a pair of gasoline V-8 engines and a turbo-diesel six-cylinder. The base engine is a 5.3-liter V-8, with a 6.2-liter V-8 optional; GMC claims both engines are all new. GMC did not offer power figures for the base engine, though the 6.2-liter will make a robust 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque. The turbo-diesel 3.0-liter Duramax six-cylinder did not receive final outputs, but the Sierra 1500 offers the same-spec engine, where it makes 277 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque. It’s likely the diesel on the Yukon and Yukon XL will make something in the same neighborhood. A 10-speed automatic transmission works with all three engines.\n\nThe redesign also moves to a fully independent rear suspension. That matches the Suburban and aligns better against competition like the Expedition, which also has an independent rear. The Yukon and Yukon XL also get an available adaptive four-corner air suspension that can adjust ride height by up to 4 inches total as conditions dictate, including a setting for maximum ground clearance.\n\nTo differentiate the Yukon and Yukon XL from the Tahoe and Suburban, the GMCs will get a unique Active Response 4WD system as an option. This includes an automatic two-speed transfer case and an electronic limited-slip differential that can shift torque around or lock in 4WD Low.\n\nSafety\n\nAutomatic forward emergency braking is standard on the Yukon and Yukon XL, and the big SUV will also offer plenty of optional safety technology. A camera-based rearview mirror, 360-degree HD cameras and rear pedestrian alerts are all available. There are also plenty of new trailering safety features, including trailer blind spot warnings, profiles for different trailers, and monitoring for trailer tire pressure and temperature.\n\nWe’ll keep a close eye out for pricing and fuel economy details (especially for the diesel) closer to this summer, when the 2021 Yukon hits dealerships.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe GMC Yukon is a full-size three-row SUV available in regular- and extended-length form (called the Yukon XL). Engine choices include a pair of gas V-8s and a turbo-diesel inline-six-cylinder. All engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\n\nThe Yukon and Yukon XL are related to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, respectively, and Yukon competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. The AT4 trim offers standard and available features aimed at improved off-road capability. Denali trims offer a higher level of luxury — with a price tag to match: The range-topping Denali Ultimate has a more expensive starting price than some trim levels of the Cadillac Escalade. GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving assist is standard on the Denali Ultimate and included in an Advanced Technology Package on the Denali. \n\nThe Yukon offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.9 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nAfter gaining the range-topping Denali Ultimate trim for 2023, the Yukon and Yukon XL see no significant changes for 2024. Both vehicles are expected to receive a substantial refresh for the 2025 model year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 GMC Yukon Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nCloth upholstery\n10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n20- or 22-inch wheels \nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nHands-free power liftgate\nIntegrated trailer-brake controller\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-sliding front center console\nBose premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAir suspension\nSuper Cruise driving-assist system\nShould I Buy the 2024 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Yukon is a refined full-size SUV with a versatile and comfortable interior. The available 6.2-liter V-8 engine is a powerful performer, and this big SUV rides well. The Denali and Denali Ultimate are expensive, but they offer a higher level of luxury and truly distinctive trim inside and out. With the exception of the Denali Ultimate, the related Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban are only a little less expensive.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBased on General Motors full-size Silverado pickup truck but measuring 20 inches longer, the Yukon XL is the king-size version of the GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle. The Chevrolet Suburban, which differs little in structure, is the corporate twin of the Yukon XL.\n\nLike the shorter Yukon, the XL comes in regular and plush Denali trims. GMC aims at a more upscale audience with the Denali luxury edition, which includes standard leather upholstery, GMs OnStar communication system and a premium sound system.\n\nA 6.0-liter or 8.1-liter V-8 engine is available only on the XL 2500 version, but the XL 1500 comes with a standard 5.3-liter V-8 and four-speed-automatic transmission. Yukon XLs with the 8.1-liter V-8 get a new heavy-duty automatic transmission for 2002, and the 5.3-liter V-8 gains upgraded Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) status. LATCH child-safety seat tethers are new this year.\n\nExterior\nStretching to 219 inches long overall  which is 7 inches shorter than the behemoth Ford Excursion  the Yukon XL rides a 130-inch wheelbase and has four side doors. The Yukon XL measures 219.3 inches from stem to stern and can extend to 77.1 inches high and 79.8 inches wide, depending on the model. Buyers get a choice of an aluminum liftgate or dual swing-out cargo doors.\n\nInterior\nAll Yukon XL models have three rows of seats; the SLE seats nine occupants, while the SLT holds only eight. The difference lies in a three-place front bench for the SLE instead of the SLTs twin front buckets. Both have three-place middle and rear benches that fold down and can be removed.\n\nFront bucket seats are optional on the SLE, while two middle bucket seats are optional on the SLT. Cargo volume is 46 cubic feet behind the rear seat or 138.4 cubic feet with the middle and rear seats removed.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine for half-ton models is a 285-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8. A 6.0-liter V-8 that develops 320 hp is standard on three-quarter-ton models, while a 340-hp, 8.1-liter V-8 is optional. The Denali gets a 325-hp version of the 6.0-liter engine.\n\nAll engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Yukon XL Denali has permanently engaged all-wheel drive, while other Yukon XL models are available with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which engages automatically when additional traction is needed. With the 8.1-liter V-8 engine, the Yukon XL can tow up to 12,000 pounds. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe GMC Yukon is a full-size three-row SUV available in regular- and extended-length form (called XL). Engine choices include a pair of gas V-8s, as well as a turbo-diesel inline-six. All engines pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\n\nThe Yukon and Yukon XL are related to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, respectively, and Yukon competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. The AT4 trim offers standard and available features aimed at improved off-road capability. Denali trims offer a higher level of luxury — with a price tag to match: The new range-topping Denali Ultimate has a more expensive starting price than some trim levels of the Cadillac Escalade. The Yukon offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.9 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Denali Ultimate debuts as the most opulent Yukon to date, with standard luxury features like upgraded leather upholstery and interior trim, massaging front seats and an 18-speaker Bose audio system. Though its availability is limited, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving assist is standard on the Denali Ultimate and included in an Advanced Technology Package on the Denali.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 GMC Yukon Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\nCloth upholstery\n10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nHands-free power liftgate\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower-sliding front center console\nBose premium stereo\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAir suspension\nSuper Cruise driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 GMC Yukon?\n\nThe Yukon is a refined full-size SUV with a versatile and comfortable interior. The available 6.2-liter V-8 engine is a powerful performer, and this big SUV rides well. The Denali and Denali Ultimate are expensive, but they offer a higher level of luxury and truly distinctive trim inside and out. With the exception of the Denali Ultimate, the related Tahoe and Suburban are a little less expensive, but not by much.",

      "expert_review": "I’ll devote this review to the Yukon XL, an SUV we drove in top-level Denali trim. To the benefit of third-row legroom and cargo space, the Yukon XL adds a substantial 20.5 inches of length versus the regular Yukon, which we cover separately on Cars.com. It’s closely related to the Chevrolet Suburban, which is itself an extended-length version of the Chevy Tahoe (Chevrolet and GMC are sibling brands under GM). Compare all four SUVs here, or go here to stack up the 2019 and 2018 Yukon XL.\n\nQuick Moves\n\nGM’s excellent 6.2-liter V-8 has powered higher trim levels of the Yukon and Yukon XL for a number of years. It’s potent, with instantaneous accelerator response. Press the gas pedal and the drivetrain launches nearly 6,000 pounds of SUV with gratifying alacrity. And with 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, the motor backs up that initial response with strong, continuous power at any rpm.\n\nThe transmission — a new 10-speed automatic that arrived just one model year ago — helps a great deal. In an era where transmissions have ever-increasing gear counts but stumble on basic tasks (like downshifting without gear hunting), GM’s 10-speed answers the call without delay. It upshifts smoothly and downshifts — finding the right gear — as soon as you call for passing power. Squeeze the pedal a little or push it to the floor and the 10-speed downshifts in half the time it takes some automatics we’ve evaluated. Bravo.\n\nLesser trim levels (the base SLE and two SLT grades) have a six-speed automatic and 5.3-liter V-8 with 355 hp and 383 pounds-feet of torque. We’ve tested that drivetrain in the Yukon XL’s twin, the Chevy Suburban, and it offers decent low-rpm power but just adequate mid-range punch. Passing maneuvers require most of the engine’s reserves. That’s in stark contrast with the redesigned Ford Expedition, a rival whose standard turbocharged V-6 packs performance akin to GM’s 6.2-liter. Whatever the formula, the Yukon XL charges extra for the best results. The Expedition does not.\n\nThe Yukon XL’s combined EPA-estimated mileage is in the high teens with either drivetrain, but GM recommends premium fuel with the 6.2-liter V-8. That costs some 24 percent more per gallon as of this writing. The 5.3-liter V-8 runs fine on the cheap stuff. With either engine, towing capacity maxes out at just more than 8,000 pounds for most variants. That’s competitive with other full-size SUVs, but those with serious towing needs should seek out the Expedition’s 9,000-plus pounds of capacity.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nLike the Chevy Tahoe RST we recently tested in Cars.com’s Full-Size SUV Challenge, our Yukon XL Denali came with optional 22-inch wheels. Both SUVs drive home the impact of supersized wheels on ride quality. With the associated low-profile P285/45R22 tires, the Yukon XL exhibits poor isolation at higher speeds, even with the optional adaptive shock absorbers on Denali trims. Noise levels are low, but highway driving results in jittery turbulence on anything short of smooth pavement. GM offers rims measuring as small as 18 inches; even the Denali can wear more sensible 20s.\n\nWheels won’t alter the SUV’s body-on-frame roots; broken pavement leads to noticeable chassis shudder. That’s to be expected in a full-size SUV, but it’s high time GM improves the Yukon XL’s other reflexes. Steering requires annoyingly high effort at low speeds and exhibits numb, lifeless feedback as you maneuver through corners. It doesn’t have to be this way: As the Expedition proves, big SUVs can have lively steering. Our test Yukon’s tires exhibited good grip, but excessive body roll will keep you from testing their limits. The standard brakes, meanwhile, are as spongy as they come. High-performance Brembo brakes are optional, but we didn’t test them.\n\nBig Outside, Modest Inside\n\nTotal seating capacity is eight with a second-row bench or seven with captain’s chairs, but despite all its exterior bulk, seating space is curiously modest. The front seats are wide but lack much sliding range; tall drivers will wish they had another inch or two. The second row has room to spare but lacks any sliding adjustments, so those in the third row can’t negotiate more legroom from their seatmates. As such — and despite an extra 9.7 inches’ legroom versus the regular Yukon — third-row space is merely adequate in the Yukon XL. Cargo space behind it, however, is 39.3 cubic feet, GM says. That’s well over double what’s in the regular-length Yukon.\n\nThe current generation of GM’s full-size SUVs enter their fifth model year for 2019, and that age is apparent in certain outdated-looking controls. The cabin’s risk-averse design, however, has held up well overall. Materials are good where it counts, with lavish padding where your elbows and knees end up. Denali shoppers might take issue with the trim level’s $70,000-plus asking price not getting you more consistency below arm level, where GM still stashes plenty of cheaper plastics.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\n\nPower front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control and a Bose stereo with an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and HD radio are standard. Standard power points include five USB ports and a household-style outlet; an optional rear entertainment system with Blu-ray compatibility adds two more USB ports.\n\nThe Yukon XL starts around $51,000; four-wheel drive adds $3,000 to any trim level. At the other end, a loaded Denali — with power-extending running boards, 22-inch rims and an entertainment system with screens for the second and third rows — can top out around $85,000 with factory options. Disappointingly, automatic emergency braking, an important safety feature, is optional instead of standard.\n\nRedesign ‘Round the Corner?\n\nGM’s large SUVs share underpinnings with the automaker’s half-ton pickup trucks and typically follow their redesign by a model year or two. Given that the automaker just overhauled its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickups for 2019, the next generation of SUVs is likely close behind.\n\nIn the meantime, the Yukon XL sits in the shadow of the Expedition, an SUV that’s better in most ways. The Denali gets top-level equipment and a few styling differences, but similar money could get you a bona fide luxury rig like the Lincoln Navigator, a hands-down better choice. Shop the GMC if discounts are high in the current generation’s twilight years, but give the Expedition — and the Nissan Armada, for that matter — a hard look, too.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Yukon is a full-size, truck-based SUV that can seat up to nine people in certain configurations. The Yukon shares its platform with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and it comes in two sizes: regular and XL, the latter being GMC's version of the Suburban\n\n\nBoth the Yukon and the Yukon XL are available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and competitors include the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia.\n\n\nDenali models get a new chrome grille, plus a 10-speed automatic transmission that replaces an eight-speed automatic.\n\nYukon XL\n\nWhereas the regular Yukon is a twin to the Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV, the Yukon XL is GMC’s version of the Chevrolet Suburban — a king-size SUV. The Yukon XL has the same styling and major features of the regular Yukon but offers more cargo room.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nWheelbase is 14 inches longer than Yukon’s\nOverall length is 20.4 inches longer\nMaximum cargo volume is 26.4 cubic feet greater, at 121.1 cubic feet",

      "expert_review": "If you’re like me, you probably find it difficult to associate the notion of agility with something weighing well over 2 tons, but that’s exactly what GMC is pushing here.\n\nGMC’s marketing troops insist that the Yukon XL Denali — curb weight 5,850 pounds — possesses “unsurpassed agility.”\n\nWhen I first heard this pitch, delivered just before I climbed aboard for a day of back-road driving near this southern California seaside city, you can imagine the reaction — a barely-suppressed snort of derision.\n\nAgile? Yeah, right. Agile like a bulldozer. Nimble, like an elephant. Who do these guys think they’re kidding?\n\nTurns out that GMC’s suggestion, so absurd in the abstract, makes a certain amount of sense in the real world.\n\nHaving said that, though, I feel obligated to affix an asterisk. Like any other descriptor, agility is a relative term. Compared to another vehicle in this size class — the Ford Excursion — GMC’s posh pachyderm is in fact surprisingly quick. But compared to a good midsize family sedan — a Honda Accord, for example — the dynamic distinctions of the Yukon XL Denali become pretty much academic: It’s a brontosaur, just like the rest of them.\n\nStill, as king-size sport-utilities go, this one has exceptionally good road manners, as well as lots of standard luxury features, and plenty of power.\n\nBut are we getting ahead of the story here? How many know what, exactly, a Yukon XL Denali is?\n\nWell, why should you know? Although it’s been around for a couple of years, Denali hasn’t exactly become a household word in automotive circles, and the XL edition is new to GMC’s product inventory for 2001.\n\nHere’s the short version. Renewed last year, the Yukon is GMC’s version of the Chevy Tahoe, a full-size sport-utility that competes with the Ford Expedition and, in 2001, the all-new Toyota Sequoia.\n\nAs part of the division’s effort to create a separate image for GMC, the General Motors brand brain trust settled on Yukon XL as the new name. Brilliant, huh? But if you think of XL as Xtra Large, it works well enough.\n\nSo how large is extra large in this case?\n\nAs you’d expect, the Yukon XL Denali shares the dimensions of the Suburban and the Yukon XL. It’s 20.4 inches longer than the Tahoe and the Yukon, 14.7 inches longer than the Expedition and 7.4 inches shorter than Ford’s behemoth Excursion.\n\nIn fact, the Suburban and Yukon XL actually got a tad smaller in their redesign for the 2000 model year, a decision that in hindsight looks like sheer genius, given the environmental polemics inspired by the introduction of the giant Excursion.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe Yukon XL Denali is a little heavier than the Suburban and Yukon XL, thanks to its heavy array of luxury features, but even so it’s lean and mean compared to the Excursion, whose curb weights approach an astonishing 4 tons.\n\nWeight is the implacable and indefatigable enemy in all veh icle dynamics — going, stopping, changing directions — and when you add the extra ground clearance required for even modest off-road usefulness, you have a package that’s going to be more reluctant to do any of the above.\n\nWhich is why the XL Denali is such a nice surprise. Although herding this black-tie brute around sinuous sports-car back roads isn’t exactly an activity an owner would be likely to schedule under the heading of what-shall-we-do-for-fun-today, the XL Denali handles aggressive cornering, tight S-bends and repeated hard braking with far more composure than I expected.\n\nNot to mention excellent ride quality, even on stretches of pavement patched to the point of resembling some sort of asphalt crazy quilt.\n\nAt this point, I hear someone saying, “So what? I’m never gonna drive this thing like a sports car, so all this alleged agility doesn’t have zip to do with me.”\n\nI beg to differ. A vehicle’s ability to respond briskly to a driver’s commands i its index of performance for emergency avoidance maneuvers. It’s the small edge that can make the difference between a crash and a near-miss. You might never have occasion to exploit it, but it’s an active safety ace-in-the-hole that’s reassuring to have.\n\nSturdiness is a plus\n\nThere are several key elements in this vehicle’s excellent performance story.\n\nFirst is its structure. All of GM’s full-size sport-utility vehicles ride on the GMT800 chassis, a platform that made its debut with the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks two years ago.\n\nThe sport-utility versions of this chassis differ from the pickups, of course; the rear portions of the frame rails are much more robust, to support the extra structure of the wagon-style body work. But be that as it may, this platform is arguably the the sturdiest in the big sport-utility business.\n\nAdvantage No. 2: power train. GM’s new family of Vortec V8 truck engines, in this case the Vortec 6000 with 320-horsepower and 365 foot-pounds of torque. This is an excellent truck engine: smooth, potent and responsive right from idle speeds. And it’s paired with one of GM’s excellent automatic transmissions.\n\nTo be fair, the Excursion offers two engine options with more grunt — a 6.8-liter V10 and a 7.3-liter turbodiesel V8 — but keep those curb weights in mind. Ford’s big bopper needs that extra thrust.\n\nIn any case, the XL Denali has enough suds to tow up to 8,400 pounds — 1,600 pounds less than a turbodiesel Excursion, but hefty enough for most of us.\n\nAdvantage three: brakes. Like the Excursion, the XL Denali has disc brakes at both ends, and ABS is standard equipment. But there’s a lot less vehicle to stop here than with a comparably equipped (for example, four-wheel-drive) Excursion and, more important, GM’s big sport-utility brake systems are vastly improved over the preceding generation.\n\nDon’t expect sedan stopping distances here. All the vehicles in this class need far more road to stop than passenger cars. But the new GM truck brakes get the job done far better than their predecessors, with much better brake pedal feel, and much better fade resistance in repeated hard stops.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard equipment, and this too is a new system. Instead of a traditional part-time system, with a low-range gear set for low-speed creepy-crawly off-road stuff, the XL Denali has a new full-time all-wheel drive setup.\n\nIn normal operation, the system sends 38 percent of the engine’s power to the front wheels, 62 to the rear, and can vary the split when system sensors detect slippage at either end.\n\nIt’s totally transparent, as they say, always engaged, with no buttons to push or levers to throw. That is just the way we’ve told the industry we like it.\n\nKeeping it simple\n\nInside, the XL Denali is about what you’d expect — a hedonistic Yukon XL, chockablock with luxury features.\n\nI think GM could have been a little more adventurous with the dashboard design, which looks decidedly rectilinear compared to today’s organic shapes, and the seats could be a little more supportive, but if you’re looking for luxury with power and plenty of space for passengers (eight, in three roomy rows) and cargo, well, here you go.\n\nAnother asterisk is in order at this point.\n\nAs someone who favors light and nimble over big and ponderous, I have trouble seeing everyday virtue in these brute-utes.\n\nThey’re overweight, they’re thirsty, and unless serious towing is on your agenda, they don’t really make any sense.\n\nBut we’re living in an era of unparalleled self-indulgence. And the people who buy vehicles like this don’t seem to care much about whether they make sense or not.\n\nSo if you fall into that category, you might as well opt for the best of the bigs. And even though my impressions are based on preproduction hardware, it looks as though GMC’s king-size Denali desr es that distinction.",

      "expert_review": "Usually I have to restrain myself when packing the car to go on vacation, especially since I seem to be allotted less and less space with each additional child. (I make it sound like I’ve got a whole clan; actually I only have two). Between the pack-n-play, the stroller, the kiddie backpack and all the other rubbish, there’s usually very little space left for me. But not so this weekend; as I pack for a ladies-only holiday sans kidlets, the Yukon XL allows me to indulge in a former bad habit: overpacking. Why only bring two pair of shoes when I can easily get away with four? I couldn’t possibly deprive myself of the sassy girly shoes, the comfy driving slip-ons, the sneakers … oh, and, of course, my multifunctional “flops.” Even though I only required a fraction of the accoutrement I ended up bringing, it is so much more delightful to bring it all, and I could: The Yukon’s got space. In my defense, my girlfriends were also heavily loaded with girl gear for the two-night journey. I threw all of the bags into the cargo area behind the third row, which swallowed up all our luggage with room to spare, including a complete assortment of paints, paintbrushes and canvases.\n\nCruising on the highway, I was surprised by how quickly the hours passed by. I admittedly love being a passenger on long-distance drives, but this time I truly enjoyed motoring along; I think the juicy chit-chat, tummy-teasing laughs, lengthy heart-to-hearts and delectable assortment of munchies had a little something to do with it. But I also know the Yukon XL is made to please, with features like a remote vehicle starter (great for chilly mornings); tri-zone A/C, which keeps the temperature truly optimal; powered, 12-way driver and passenger seats; cushy second-row captain’s chairs; a DVD player; a rearview camera; and a user-friendly navigation system. I also enjoyed the satellite radio, which created perfect ambiance for hours of travel – everyone was pleased as we worked through various musical genres from new age to techno to alternative to Broadway to the ’80s.\n\nOnce at our destination, and driving into town later that night, I (miraculously) had access to two parking spots. My two-space parking maneuver garnered some attention (hey, at least I re-parked it), and upon descending from the mammoth black Yukon XL we definitely got some interesting looks. I chose to assume it had everything to do with our being such a dazzling posse of decked-out women (a powerful imagination works wonders). Back to the parking: This car-beast is wonderful in suburbia, but once in tight alleys, look out. I opted to leave the Yukon XL parked at the hotel for the rest of our stay because it was so much easier to get around the European-esque streets in my friend’s normal-sized car.\n\nConsidering how large the Yukon XL is, I think it could use more storage space. I found the glove box and bottle holders on either side of the driver and passenger doors to be rather minimalist. I was also hard-pressed to find a good place for my sunglasses. At one point I stored them on top of the center console in a recessed shallow tray, only to find that once I opened the console, everything slid off into the rear. Not good. Also, since the cupholders in the second row are low (hard for restrained children to reach), I wished for additional cupholders on either side of the captain’s chairs. I was, however, pleased to see that the third-row passengers had access to four cupholders, plus a tray on either side (great for snacks).\n\nLastly, I was excited to read about the Yukon XL’s FlexFuel engine, which can run on regular gasoline or E85 (a mix of 85 percent ethanol and 15% gasoline). Because E85 is made from corn, it is a renewable fuel, and it reduces greenhouse gas emissions. There are about 600 ethanol stations across the United States; after a little research I learned that the closest station in my area is 23 miles away. So, although there is some effort associated with flex-fuel vehicles, I applaud GM’s effort in giving the consumer options in making greener decisions.\n\nUpon returning the Yukon XL, I delighted in the memory of a wonderfully luxurious road trip. This vehicle puts a whole new spin on comfort and travel. As hard as it is to scale back from first class to economy, though, I do look forward to lower-maintenance parking and better maneuverability.\n\n*For more information on the Yukon XL and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great -Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon XL is the brand’s flagship sport utility vehicle, available in base half-ton (1500) and three-quarter-ton (2500) versions and a top-of-the-line Denali trim. The Yukon XL is available with a choice of V-8 engines, some of which feature fuel-management systems that deactivate four cylinders during low-load situations. The Yukon XL is closely related to its GM cousin, the Chevrolet Suburban; the only other extra-long full-size SUV is the Ford Expedition EL.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no significant changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon XL has integrated running boards, and Denali models have a number of features that distinguish them from other models, including a chrome grille and 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe Yukon XL measures about 20 inches longer than the regular Yukon, at 222.4 inches long, with a width of 79.1 inches. Its dimensions are nearly identical to the Expedition EL.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nStandard power, heated side mirrors\nChrome honeycomb grille (Denali)\nOptional power liftgate\nAvailable power-operated retractable running boards\n\nInterior\nHigh-quality fixtures include flush-mounted controls, low-gloss materials and chrome instrument surrounds. For maximum seating capacity, the Yukon XL can have three rows of seats to accommodate up to nine occupants. Cargo volume measures 45.8 cubic feet behind the third row. With the third row removed and the second row folded — made easier by an available power-folding feature — cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet; that’s compared with the Expedition EL’s 130.8 cubic feet.\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with redundant controls\nStandard XM Satellite Radio with real-time traffic and route advisements\nAvailable cloth, vinyl or leather-appointed seats\nAvailable integrated rear camera in rearview mirror\nAvailable heated/cooled seats\nAvailable third-row DVD system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon XL is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have a permanent all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon.\n\nThere is an integrated brake controller option, which provides proper brake-force signaling to a trailer’s brake systems, and a heavy-duty trailering package. Yukon XL 2500 models replace the five-link coil-spring suspension with heavy-duty multileaf springs. 2500 models also come with a hydraulic brake booster that supplements the braking system with additional pressure. When properly equipped, the 2500 model can tow up to 9,600 pounds; 1500 models can tow a maximum of 8,100 pounds.\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nPower rack-and-pinion steering\nFlex-fuel 310-horsepower, 5.3-liter iron-block V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque and available cylinder deactivation (1500)\nFlex-fuel 352-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 382 pounds-feet of torque and variable-valve timing (2500)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional variable load-leveling suspension\nAvailable fuel-saving 3.08:1 axel ratio\n\nSafety\nNew safety options include a blind spot warning system, a rearview camera system integrated into the rearview mirror, rear parking assist and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFront dual-stage airbags with passenger-sensing system\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSeat-mounted thorax airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes (with hydroboost on 2500 models)\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2012 GMC Yukon XL. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2012 GMC Yukon XL combines room and capability like few SUVs can, but unless you’re getting the high-line Denali trim, it’s hard to see why you wouldn’t pick its cheaper twin, the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nThe Yukon XL is GMC’s version of the Suburban (compare them here) and it gets a few updates for 2012. As its name suggests, the Yukon XL is an extension of the shorter Yukon; it’s also related to the Chevrolet Tahoe, as well as Cadillac’s Escalade family. It’s GMC’s largest SUV, and it competes with the Ford Expedition EL and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nVariants include the half-ton Yukon XL 1500 and the three-quarter-ton Yukon XL 2500. Trims are the base SLE, midlevel SLT and top-of-the-line Denali (1500 only). See all the versions here. We drove a four-wheel-drive Yukon XL 1500 SLT. I recently reviewed the Suburban, so I’ll focus here on what differentiates the Yukon XL from the Suburban.\n\nWhy the Yukon?\nUnique headlights and an undivided GMC grille differentiate the Yukon from its Suburban sibling, but its boxy profile gives their relationship away. The GMC throws in a few extra standard features, especially in the SLE and Denali trims, but you’ll pay for them up front. Decide if it’s worth it:\n\nSuburban 1500 (LS/LT/LTZ) vs. Yukon XL 1500 (SLE/SLT/Denali)\n \tLS vs. SLE\tLT vs. SLT\tLTZ vs. Denali\nWhat It Costs\t$43,215 vs. $44,550\t$46,975 vs. $48,785\t$56,110 vs. $58,670\nWhat You Get\tBose stereo\n\nTri-zone auto A/C\n\nAuto-dimming mirror\n\n\tAuto-dimming mirror\tLarger V-8 (+26% hp, -6% mpg)\n\nLeather gearshift\n\nFaux-wood steering wheel\n\nDVD-audio capability\n\nAvailable AWD (vs. 4WD in Suburban)\n\n\nPrices include destination charges. Source: Automaker information.\n\nSame Experience\nOur test car’s optional adaptive suspension made for excellent ride quality, but like the Suburban, the Yukon XL needs grooming. The steering lacks enough power assist at low speeds, then becomes jittery and tentative on the highway. The SUV changes direction as well as its boat-like dimensions suggest, with body roll aplenty. There’s some nosedive upon braking, too. Our tester’s 5,824 pounds overwhelmed its 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8, and the indecisive six-speed automatic hunted for gears even in cruise control, groping for pockets of higher-rev power that never existed in the first place. The Expedition EL feels more composed at high speeds, and the 5.7-liter Sequoia makes quicker work of the passing lane. The Yukon XL lumbers.\n\nOf course, it can pull a lot of lumber too. Towing capacity is 8,100 pounds in the 1500 and 9,600 pounds in the 2500, which has a 352-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. Both figures beat the Sequoia; the Expedition EL tops out at 8,900 pounds.\n\nThe 1500 Denali gets a 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8. We’ve driven that engine in the Escalade, where it’s standard, and it matches the Sequoia’s gusto. The Denali swaps the Yukon XL’s four-wheel drive and selectable transfer case for all-wheel-drive with automatic power transfer. EPA gas mileage ranges from a dreadful 10/15 mpg city/highway for the four-wheel-drive Yukon XL 2500 to 15/21 mpg in the 5.3-liter Yukon XL 1500. Believe it or not, the latter figure actually beats the Sequoia and Expedition EL. Still, make sure you need the truck-based Chevy’s towing capacity if you buy one. If not, car-based crossover SUVs and minivans are rated 2 to 6 mpg better in combined driving, with lower starting prices to boot.\n\nLike the Suburban, the Yukon XL boasts plenty of cargo and passenger room, with the extra length making the three-position third row roomy enough for adults. Behind that row, the Yukon XL boasts nearly three times the Yukon’s cargo room, with a minivan-like 137.4 cubic feet of maximum volume if you remove the third row and fold down the second.\n\nCabin quality becomes less competitive every year, but at least GMC updated the available navigation system for 2012. It combines decent graphics with GM’s penchant for touch-screen usability. Denali versions have additional sound insulation.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Yukon XL hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rates the 1500 Denali four out of five stars overall. The SUV earned top ratings in frontal and side impacts, but just a three-star rollover rating. (Three stars is the norm for truck-based SUV rollover resistance, but the Expedition and Sequoia buck the trend with four-star ratings.) The Yukon XL 2500 hasn’t been crash-tested.\n\nStandard features include head-protecting side airbags for all three rows, plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Denali editions get a blind spot warning system. Click here for a full list of safety features, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions. GMC says the Yukon XL seats up to nine, but that requires an optional three-position bench seat up front. We recommend against that, as the center position lacks frontal airbag coverage and gets only a lap seat belt.\n\nThe Yukon XL 1500 starts around $44,500 (including a destination charge of $995), with the 2500 running roughly $1,500 more. Standard features in the 1500 include tri-zone automatic climate control, partial power front seats, a USB/iPod-friendly Bose stereo and Bluetooth cellphone connectivity, but not audio streaming. Heated and cooled leather seats, fully powered seat adjustments, a heated power-tilt steering wheel, rear DVD entertainment system and a navigation system are optional. A factory-loaded 2500 SLT tops out around $60,000, and the 1500 Denali can top $65,000.\n\nYukon XL in the Market\nIt’s no mystery why GMC avoided the fate of Saturn, Pontiac, Hummer and Saab in GM’s restructuring. Trucks are generally more profitable than cars, every GMC vehicle is based on a Chevrolet, and most of them carry a higher starting price. What’s more, GMC buyers tend to add more options to their vehicles than do Chevy buyers. As cash cows go, GM’s truck-and-SUV division was a choice bovine.\n\nFor consumers, the GMC appeal may be worth the added cost for models that sport enough styling differentiation — think the Acadia and Terrain SUVs. The Yukon XL doesn’t follow that mold. Except for Denali trims, it’s just a pricier Suburban — especially the midlevel SLT. The Denali’s 6.2-liter V-8 offers a potent solution to the lumbering 5.3-liter, but short of that, if you need what the Yukon XL offers, visit your Chevy dealer.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 GMC Yukon XL combines room and capability like few SUVs can, but unless you’re getting the high-line Denali trim, it’s hard to see why you wouldn’t pick its cheaper twin, the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nThe Yukon XL is GMC’s version of the Suburban (compare them here) and it gets a few updates for 2012. As its name suggests, the Yukon XL is an extension of the shorter Yukon; it’s also related to the Chevrolet Tahoe, as well as Cadillac’s Escalade family. It’s GMC’s largest SUV, and it competes with the Ford Expedition EL and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nVariants include the half-ton Yukon XL 1500 and the three-quarter-ton Yukon XL 2500. Trims are the base SLE, midlevel SLT and top-of-the-line Denali (1500 only). We drove a four-wheel-drive Yukon XL 1500 SLT. I recently reviewed the Suburban, so I’ll focus here on what differentiates the Yukon XL from the Suburban.\n\nWhy the Yukon?\nUnique headlights and an undivided GMC grille differentiate the Yukon from its Suburban sibling, but its boxy profile gives their relationship away. The GMC throws in a few extra standard features, especially in the SLE and Denali trims, but you’ll pay for them up front. Decide if it’s worth it:\n\n \n\nSuburban 1500 (LS/LT/LTZ) vs. Yukon XL 1500 (SLE/SLT/Denali)\n \tLS vs. SLE\tLT vs. SLT\tLTZ vs. Denali\nWhat It Costs\t$43,215 vs. $44,550\t$46,975 vs. $48,785\t$56,110 vs. $58,670\nWhat You Get\tBose stereo\n\nTri-zone auto A/C\n\nAuto-dimming mirror\n\n\tAuto-dimming mirror\tLarger V-8 (+26% hp, -6% mpg)\n\nLeather gearshift\n\nFaux-wood steering wheel\n\nDVD-audio capability\n\nAvailable AWD (vs. 4WD in Suburban)\n\n\nPrices include destination charges. Source: Automaker information.\n\nSame Experience\nOur test car’s optional adaptive suspension made for excellent ride quality, but like the Suburban, the Yukon XL needs grooming. The steering lacks enough power assist at low speeds, then becomes jittery and tentative on the highway. The SUV changes direction as well as its boat-like dimensions suggest, with body roll aplenty. There’s some nosedive upon braking, too. Our tester’s 5,824 pounds overwhelmed its 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8, and the indecisive six-speed automatic hunted for gears even in cruise control, groping for pockets of higher-rev power that never existed in the first place. The Expedition EL feels more composed at high speeds, and the 5.7-liter Sequoia makes quicker work of the passing lane. The Yukon XL lumbers.\n\nOf course, it can pull a lot of lumber too. Towing capacity is 8,100 pounds in the 1500 and 9,600 pounds in the 2500, which has a 352-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. Both figures beat the Sequoia; the Expedition EL tops out at 8,900 pounds.\n\nThe 1500 Denali gets a 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8. We’ve driven that engine in the Escalade, where it’s standard, and it matches the Sequoia’s gusto. The Denali swaps the Yukon XL’s four-wheel drive and selectable transfer case for all-wheel-drive with automatic power transfer. EPA gas mileage ranges from a dreadful 10/15 mpg city/highway for the four-wheel-drive Yukon XL 2500 to 15/21 mpg in the 5.3-liter Yukon XL 1500. Believe it or not, the latter figure actually beats the Sequoia and Expedition EL. Still, make sure you need the truck-based Chevy’s towing capacity if you buy one. If not, car-based crossover SUVs and minivans are rated 2 to 6 mpg better in combined driving, with lower starting prices to boot.\n\nLike the Suburban, the Yukon XL boasts plenty of cargo and passenger room, with the extra length making the three-position third row roomy enough for adults. Behind that row, the Yukon XL boasts nearly three times the Yukon’s cargo room, with a minivan-like 137.4 cubic feet of maximum volume if you remove the third row and fold down the second.\n\nCabin quality becomes less competitive every year, but at least GMC updated the available navigation system for 2012. It combines decent graphics with GM’s penchant for touch-screen usability. Denali versions have additional sound insulation.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Yukon XL hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rates the 1500 Denali four out of five stars overall. The SUV earned top ratings in frontal and side impacts, but just a three-star rollover rating. (Three stars is the norm for truck-based SUV rollover resistance, but the Expedition and Sequoia buck the trend with four-star ratings.) The Yukon XL 2500 hasn’t been crash-tested.\n\nStandard features include head-protecting side airbags for all three rows, plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Denali editions get a blind spot warning system. Click here for a full list of safety features, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions. GMC says the Yukon XL seats up to nine, but that requires an optional three-position bench seat up front. We recommend against that, as the center position lacks frontal airbag coverage and gets only a lap seat belt.\n\nThe Yukon XL 1500 starts around $44,500 (including a destination charge of $995), with the 2500 running roughly $1,500 more. Standard features in the 1500 include tri-zone automatic climate control, partial power front seats, a USB/iPod-friendly Bose stereo and Bluetooth cellphone connectivity, but not audio streaming. Heated and cooled leather seats, fully powered seat adjustments, a heated power-tilt steering wheel, rear DVD entertainment system and a navigation system are optional. A factory-loaded 2500 SLT tops out around $60,000, and the 1500 Denali can top $65,000.\n\nYukon XL in the Market\nIt’s no mystery why GMC avoided the fate of Saturn, Pontiac, Hummer and Saab in GM’s restructuring. Trucks are generally more profitable than cars, every GMC vehicle is based on a Chevrolet, and most of them carry a higher starting price. What’s more, GMC buyers tend to add more options to their vehicles than do Chevy buyers. As cash cows go, GM’s truck-and-SUV division was a choice bovine.\n\nFor consumers, the GMC appeal may be worth the added cost for models that sport enough styling differentiation — think the Acadia and Terrain SUVs. The Yukon XL doesn’t follow that mold. Except for Denali trims, it’s just a pricier Suburban — especially the midlevel SLT. The Denali’s 6.2-liter V-8 offers a potent solution to the lumbering 5.3-liter, but short of that, if you need what the Yukon XL offers, visit your Chevy dealer.\n\n \n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon XL is the brand’s flagship SUV, available in base half-ton (1500) and three-quarter-ton (2500) versions and a top-of-the-line Denali trim. The Yukon XL is available with a choice of V-8 engines, some of which feature fuel-management systems that deactivate four cylinders during low-load situations. The Yukon XL is closely related to its GM cousin, the Chevrolet Suburban; the only other extra-long full-size SUV is the Ford Expedition EL.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon XL has integrated running boards, and Denali models have a number of features that distinguish them from other models, including a chrome grille and 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe Yukon XL measures about 20 inches longer than the regular Yukon, at 222.4 inches long, with a width of 79.1 inches.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nStandard power heated side mirrors\nChrome honeycomb grille (Denali)\nOptional power liftgate\nAvailable power-operated retractable running boards\n\nInterior\nHigh-quality fixtures include flush-mounted controls, low-gloss materials and chrome instrument surrounds. For maximum seating capacity, the Yukon XL can have three rows of seats to accommodate up to nine occupants.\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with redundant controls\nStandard XM Satellite Radio with real-time traffic info\nAvailable cloth, vinyl or leather-appointed seats\nAvailable integrated rear camera in rearview mirror\nAvailable heated/cooled seats\nAvailable third-row DVD system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon XL is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have a permanent all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon.\n\nThere is an integrated brake controller option, which provides proper brake-force signaling to a trailer’s brake systems, and a heavy-duty trailering package. Yukon XL 2500 models replace the five-link coil-spring suspension with heavy-duty multileaf springs. A hydraulic brake booster in the 2500 model supplements the braking system with additional pressure. When properly equipped, the 2500 model can tow up to 9,600 pounds; 1500 models can tow a maximum of 8,100 pounds.\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nPower rack-and-pinion steering\nFlex-fuel 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter iron-block V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque and available cylinder deactivation (1500)\nFlex-fuel 352-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 382 pounds-feet of torque and variable valve timing (2500)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional variable load-leveling suspension\n\nSafety\nSafety options include a blind spot warning system, a rearview camera system integrated into the rearview mirror, rear parking assist and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFront dual-stage airbags with passenger-sensing system\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSeat-mounted thorax airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBased on General Motors’ Silverado full-size pickup truck, the Yukon XL is the king-size version of GMC’s Yukon sport utility vehicle. The Chevrolet Suburban, which differs little in structure, is the corporate twin of the Yukon XL. Full-size rivals include the mammoth Ford Excursion and the Toyota Sequoia.\n\nLike the automaker’s shorter Yukon, the Yukon XL comes in SLE, SLT and plush Denali trim levels. GMC aims this SUV at a more upscale audience with the Denali luxury edition, which includes leather upholstery and a premium sound system with an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nHalf-ton models are labeled Yukon XL 1500, while the Yukon XL 2500 has a three-quarter-ton rating. A 6.0-liter or 8.1-liter V-8 powers the 2500 version, while the 1500 comes with a standard 5.3-liter V-8. Denali models — offered only in half-ton form — get a 335-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8.\n\nNew Ultra Bright 17-inch wheels and a DVD-based touch-screen navigation radio are available, and GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard. Several other notable features, including steering-wheel-mounted auxiliary controls, GM’s OnStar communication system and an electrochromatic rearview mirror, become standard for 2006.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a 130-inch wheelbase, the Yukon XL has four side doors. It stretches to 219.3 inches long overall, which is 20 inches longer than the regular Yukon but shorter than the Excursion. Denali models can be fitted with 20-inch seven-spoke wheels.\n\nInterior\nAll Yukon XL models have three rows of seats, which yield a seating capacity of seven, eight or nine occupants, depending on the configuration. Bucket seats or a three-place bench go up front, and the second row holds two or three people. All models have a three-place rear bench that folds down and can be removed.\n\nCargo volume in the Yukon XL measures nearly 46 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 131.6 cubic feet when the middle and rear seats are removed. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system is optional. Denali models include XM Satellite Radio and adjustable pedals, which are optional in other Yukon XLs.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe half-ton Yukon XL 1500 uses a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8, which can now run on a combination of gasoline and ethanol. Denali models are equipped with a 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 that produces 375 pounds-feet of torque. A 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 is standard and a 325-hp, 8.1-liter V-8 is optional in three-quarter-ton 2500 models. All engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nThe Denali has permanently engaged four-wheel drive. Other Yukon XL models are available with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive that engages automatically when additional traction is needed. Yukon XL 1500 models can tow as much as 7,800 pounds, and the Yukon XL 2500 equipped with the 8.1-liter engine can haul up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage occupant-sensing front airbags, antilock brakes and StabiliTrak are standard. Side-impact airbags are standard in the Denali and optional in other models.",

      "expert_review": "You’ve heard the phrase, &quot;Time is money.&quot; Well, it truly is cold cash and lots of time when you stand outside on a bitter New Hampshire morning pumping gasoline into the near-empty, 36.9-gallon tank of a 2003 GMC Yukon XL. That’s many minutes of time and more than $50 — and we’re not even talking premium gasoline.\n\nI know I have some readers confused about where I stand on big SUVs. He hates ’em. No, he loves ’em. In fact, I think they have their place when used properly. I think they are wasteful beasts when used as single and even two-person commuter cars. But after several days in the new Yukon — a fine, luxurious version of massive SUV — it dawned on me that maybe it is time for builders of the behemoth to scale back a bit. Do we really need to be this big?\n\nThere are SUVs that will seat seven and eight passengers in decent comfort, will handle most bad weather, and haul or tow decent loads, and their size is nowhere near as imposing, their gas mileage considerably better than the 13.1 I got with the Yukon, and their standard safety features far superior. The Volvo XC90 and Honda Pilot come to mind.\n\nOf course there are those who will slam even these two SUVs, but I’m trying to be realistic. There is a market for all-wheel-drive cars that carry multiple people and offer high-riding safety. I just wonder if it can’t be filled without being, as Edna Ferber said, &quot;So Big.&quot;\n\nThat said, the task at hand is to review this big Yukon, and I have to say it’s the sharpest handling of these big beasts.\n\nThat’s because Quadrasteer is expanding from GMC’s Sierra Denali pickup into big SUVS such as the Yukon XL.\n\nQuadrasteer is a remarkable innovation that cuts turning radius dramatically, makes the vehicle more stable in over-road towing, and makes parallel parking or backing a trailer far easier.\n\nIt uses hydraulic steering up front and electronically monitored, electric-powered steering in the rear.\n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nAt speeds above 45 miles per hour, the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front wheels. This cuts yaw — the vehicle attempting to rotate on its vertical axis because the front wheels are going where the rear wheels are not aimed. Free up those rear wheels and turn them in the same direction as the front wheels and you get smooth, yaw-free lane changes when passing, smooth carved turns on winding roads.\n\nAt lower speeds, for parking or backing up, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels, cutting the turning radius of this long vehicle from 46.2 feet to 37.4 feet. I executed round turns that were tighter than many sedans could make.\n\nThe 4-wheel-steering system can be switched off and on simply by pushing a button on the dash.\n\nAnother on-dash option for Quadrasteer is Tow Mode. This helps cut the tendency of the rear wheels to go opposite from where the front wheels are pointed. Execute a lane change while towing and the rear wheels fight to go first one way, then another, the problem exacerbated by the shifting weight of your trailer. This causes the heavy back and forth sensation that comes with towing. Tow Mode halts this for smooth, nonresistant towing.\n\nAdd this to StabilTrak, which compares the driver’s intended path to the vehicle’s actual path, and you have one stable vehicle, considering its bulk.\n\nThis system uses sensors to watch steering, antilock brakes, traction control, wheel speed, and brake pressure. It then uses braking and torque to correct problems.\n\nThe result is a smooth, effortless ride both straight ahead on the highway and on winding back roads. On frost heaves, there is some hop from the rear leaf springs, but those leaf springs are needed for when heavy loads get attached to the rear.\n\nThe suspension, in addition to the rear springs and a semifloating rear axle, includes torsion bars up front. Brakes are four-whe l discs with ABS and they stop this 3-ton vehicle in a reasonable distance, though some brake fade was detectable.\n\nThe Yukon comes in half-ton (1500) or three-quarter ton (2500, as tested) models. Each has a four-speed automatic transmission. The XL comes with a 6.0-liter V-8 engine that delivers 320 horsepower and 360 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nIt was plenty of engine to move this big rig smoothly, even when fully loaded with passengers. The roar of that engine, when pushed, is an aural affirmation of brute strength.\n\nFor all that behemoth power, this can be one smooth, quiet, and fine luxury SUV — if you’re ready to spring for the money — and that’s beyond the extra $5,000 for Quadrasteer. The test vehicle had a $5,501 luxury group that included &quot;ultrasoft&quot; front leather seating, assist steps, power front bucket seats, a Bose 9-speaker sound system, rear seat audio controls, cargo net, luggage carrier cross rails, power adjustable brake and gas pedals, XM satellite radio (100 channels of digital sound coast to coast with subscription fees extra), OnStar communication system, driver and front passenger side air bags, and power folding mirrors.\n\nAdd a rear seat DVD movie system ($1,295) and second row captain’s chairs ($490), and you are into a price league with the new Porsche Cayenne SUV.\n\nBut if you have the cash, you end up riding in great room, easy utility, and fine luxury. The dashboard controls are big and easy to use for all systems, the seats are soft and supportive at the same time, head- and legroom are plentiful, and the angle of the third row seat back makes it comfortable for even adults.\n\nMaybe that third row for adults is why we need all this size. Yet how often do we need a third row that is spacious for adults — as opposed to one more practically and frequently for our children and our friends’ children?\n\nNice touch: I love the cane-handle, huge interior door latches that GM is using in its big trucks. So easy to grip, so easy to find.\n\nAnnoyance: I know I’m supposed to know these things, but I was caught by surprise when, after locking the keys in this car, OnStar was not able to remotely unlock the car. The reason? No cellphone service where I live. So what does that mean if you need OnStar in a real emergency in some remote stretch (and lack of phone service is not always a factor of remoteness) and there is no such service?",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBased on General Motors’ Silverado full-size pickup truck, the Yukon XL is the king-size version of GMC’s Yukon sport utility vehicle. The Chevrolet Suburban, which differs little in structure, is the corporate twin of the Yukon XL. Full-size rivals include the mammoth Ford Excursion and the Toyota Sequoia.\n\nLike the automaker’s shorter Yukon, the Yukon XL comes in SLE, SLT and plush Denali trim levels. GMC aims this SUV at a more upscale audience with the Denali luxury edition, which includes leather upholstery, GM’s OnStar communication system and a premium sound system with an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nHalf-ton models are labeled Yukon XL 1500, while the Yukon XL 2500 has a three-quarter-ton rating. A 6.0-liter V-8 or an 8.1-liter V-8 powers the 2500 version, while the 1500 comes with a standard 5.3-liter V-8. Denali models � offered only in half-ton form � get a 335-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8, which signifies a 10-hp increase compared with 2004.\n\nFor 2005, GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard on 1500 models. New Ultra Bright 17-inch wheels and a DVD-based touchscreen navigation radio are available. Optional Quadrasteer four-wheel steering on the Yukon XL 2500 allows the rear wheels to turn slightly in conjunction with the front wheels to improve maneuverability.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a 130-inch wheelbase, the Yukon XL has four side doors and stretches to 219.3 inches long overall. That’s 20 inches longer than the regular Yukon but shorter than the Excursion. Denali models can be fitted with 20-inch seven-spoke wheels.\n\nInterior\nAll Yukon XL models have three rows of seats, which yield a seating capacity of seven, eight or nine occupants, depending on the configuration. Bucket seats or a three-place bench go up front, and the second row holds two or three people. All models have a three-place rear bench that folds down and can be removed.\n\nCargo volume in the Yukon XL measures nearly 46 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 131.6 cubic feet when the middle and rear seats are removed. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system is optional. Denali models include XM Satellite Radio and adjustable pedals, which are optional in other Yukon XLs.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe half-ton Yukon XL 1500 uses a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8. Denali models are equipped with a 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 that produces 375 pounds-feet of torque. A 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 is standard and a 320-hp, 8.1-liter V-8 is optional in three-quarter-ton 2500 models. All engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nThe Denali has permanently engaged four-wheel drive. Other Yukon XL models are available with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive that engages automatically when additional traction is needed. Yukon XL 1500 models can tow as much as 7,800 pounds, and the Yukon XL 2500 equipped with the 8.1-liter engine can haul up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage occupant-sensing front airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are standard in the Denali and optional in other models.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon XL is the brand’s flagship sport utility vehicle, and it underwent a complete redesign for 2007. Available in base SLE, SLT and top-of-the-line Denali trim levels, the Yukon XL is available with a choice of V-8 engines, some of which feature fuel management systems that deactivate four cylinders during low-load situations. According to the company, this technology can improve fuel economy by about 10 percent. Competitors include the Ford Expedition EL, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nTopping the range of available engines is a 6.2-liter V-8 that does without the fuel management system but boasts 380 horsepower. Rear-wheel drive is standard across most models, but four-wheel drive is available.\n\nFor 2008, side curtain airbags are standard across the Yukon XL lineup, and a new rear-wheel-drive Yukon XL Denali joins the all-wheel-drive model. Specific changes to the heavy-duty 2500 series include a newly standard electronic stability system and six-speed automatic transmission. The Yukon XL is closely related to the Chevrolet Suburban, which underwent a similar redesign for 2007.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon XL sports sleeker styling and better-integrated lower body panels than the prior generation. Larger headlamps and a cleaner front help distinguish the current Yukon XL from its predecessor. Fenders, fog lights and lower side cladding are integrated into the body to create a more continuous appearance than the previous Yukon XL’s pieced-together look.\n\nSeventeen-inch wheels are standard on most trims, but the 2500 gets 16-inch rims. The Yukon Denali upgrades to 18-inch wheels while also adding unique headlamps, grille and taillamps. Twenty-inch wheels are optional for all trims. Denali editions include a standard power liftgate. Optional parking-assistance features include a rearview camera and sonar rear parking sensors. Power-operated, retractable running boards are available.\n\nInterior\nA lower dashboard with a traditional instrument panel hump replaces the boxy dash from previous Yukon XLs. Higher-quality fixtures include flush-mounted controls, low-gloss materials and chrome instrument surrounds. Three rows of seats can accommodate up to nine occupants if configured properly, and front-seat occupants will find three inches of additional hiproom compared to the previous generation. Second-row passengers lose more than an inch of headroom, and third-row passengers sacrifice headroom and legroom.\n\nCargo volume measures 45.8 cubic feet behind the third row. With the third row removed and the second row folded — made easier with an available power-folding feature — cargo volume increases to 137.4 cubic feet.\n\nManual tri-zone climate control is standard in SLE trims. SLT and Denali editions get automatic climate control and leather seats. Denali versions up the luxury ante with heated first- and second-row seats, a premium audio system, rain-sensing windshield wipers and an available heated steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon XL can be powered by a choice of V-8 engines. A 5.3-liter V-8 propels regular-duty Yukon XLs; in rear-wheel-drive models the engine has an iron block, whereas four-wheel-drive versions have an all-aluminum mill. Both engines — which can run on either regular gasoline or E85 ethanol-based fuel — feature a fuel management system that can deactivate four of the eight cylinders when power needs are low. Total output for rear-wheel-drive models is 320 hp and 340 pounds-feet of torque, while four-wheel-drive versions make 310 hp and 335 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nAn optional 6.0-liter V-8 features variable-valve timing and cylinder deactivation and develops 366 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque. Heavy-duty 2500 series versions receive an iron-block edition of the 6.0-liter V-8 that has variable-valve timing but lacks the cylinder deactivation. This engine is rated at 352 hp and 383 pounds-feet of torque. All 5.3-liter and 6.0-liter V-8s team with a four-speed automatic transmission, except on the Yukon XL 2500. Its 6.0-liter V-8 drives a six-speed automatic transmission for 2008. When properly equipped, the Yukon XL 1500 can tow up to 8,100 pounds.\n\nThe horsepower leader is the 6.2-liter V-8. It utilizes variable-valve timing but lacks cylinder deactivation; it develops 380 hp and 417 pounds-feet of torque. This motor is available only in the Yukon XL Denali, where it drives a six-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety equipment includes four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology. GM says the system senses when the vehicle is likely to tip, then triggers the stability system in an attempt to prevent it. (To date, only Ford Motor Company’s Roll Stability Control feature can sense that a rollover has begun and attempt to forestall it.) Standard side curtain airbags cover all three rows of seats. The front seat belts feature pretensioners that can activate in the event of a rear-end collision.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC’s Yukon XL is the brand’s flagship sport utility vehicle that’s available in base half-ton (1500) and three-quarter-ton (2500) versions and a top-of-the-line Denali trim. The Yukon XL is available with a choice of V-8 engines, some of which feature fuel-management systems that deactivate four cylinders during low-load situations. The Yukon XL is closely related to its GM cousin the Chevrolet Suburban; the only other extra-long full-size SUV is the Ford Expedition EL.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe GMC Yukon XL now has a standard six-speed automatic transmission, an integrated brake controller and heavy-duty trailering options.\n\nExterior\nThe Yukon XL has integrated running boards, and Denali models have a number of features that distinguish them from other models, including a chrome grille and 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe Yukon XL measures about 20 inches longer than the regular Yukon, at 222.4 inches long, with a width of 79.1 inches. Its dimensions are nearly identical to the Expedition EL.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nStandard power and heated side mirrors\nStandard 16-inch wheels (2500), 17-inch wheels (1500), 20-inch wheels (Denali)\nChrome honeycomb grille (Denali)\nOptional power liftgate (standard on Denali)\nAvailable power-operated, retractable running boards\n\nInterior\nHigh-quality fixtures include flush-mounted controls, low-gloss materials and chrome instrument surrounds. For maximum seating capacity, the Yukon XL can have three rows of seats to accommodate up to nine occupants. Cargo volume measures 45.8 cubic feet behind the third row. With the third row removed and the second row folded — made easier by an available power-folding feature — cargo volume is 137.4 cubic feet; that’s compared to the Expedition EL’s 130.8 cubic feet.\n\nInterior options include:\n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with redundant controls\nStandard XM Satellite Radio with real-time traffic and route advisements\nAvailable cloth, vinyl or leather-appointed seats\nNewly available integrated rear camera in rearview mirror\nNewly available heated/cooled seats (Denali models)\nNewly available third-row DVD system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Yukon XL is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon Denali can have a permanent all-wheel-drive system that’s distinct from the available part-time four-wheel drive on the regular Yukon.\n\nFor 2009, there is an integrated brake controller option, which provides proper brake force signaling to a trailer’s brake systems, and a heavy-duty trailering package. Yukon XL 2500 models replace the five-link coil-spring suspension for heavy-duty multileaf springs. 2500 models also come with a hydraulic brake booster that supplements the braking system with additional pressure. When properly equipped, the 2500 model can tow up to 9,600 pounds; 1500 models can tow a maximum of 8,100 pounds.\n\nPowertrain features include:\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nPower rack-and-pinion steering\nFlex-fuel 310-horsepower, 5.3-liter aluminum-block V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque and cylinder deactivation (1500)\nFlex-fuel 310-hp, 5.3-liter iron-block V-8 with 335 pounds-feet of torque and available cylinder deactivation (1500)\n352-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 382 pounds-feet of torque and variable-valve timing (2500)\n366-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 367 pounds-feet of torque, variable-valve timing and cylinder deactivation (1500)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional variable load-leveling suspension\nAvailable fuel-saving 3.08:1 axel ratio\n\nSafety\nNew safety options include a blind-zone alert system, a rearview camera system that’s integrated into the rearview mirror, rear parking assist and rain-sensing wipers.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFront dual-stage airbags with passenger-sensing system\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensor\nSeat-mounted thorax airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes (with hydroboost on 2500 models)\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nTire pressure monitoring system\nOnStar with one year of Directions & Connections plan, which provides voice-guided directions, automatic crash response and Bluetooth hands-free calling",
