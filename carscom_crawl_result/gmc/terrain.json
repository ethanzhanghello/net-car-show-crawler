      "expert_review": "Is the GMC Terrain a Good SUV?\n\nMechanically identical to the less expensive but equally stylish Chevrolet Equinox, the redesigned 2025 GMC Terrain has the same wins (comfort, style and content) and losses (lackluster powertrain and sloppy handling) as its cheaper Chevy cousin, but it has a more polished interior.\n\nHow Does the GMC Terrain Compare With Other SUVs?\n\nIt’s as comfortable, stylish, useful and well built as many of its competitors, but the Terrain’s anemic acceleration and uninspiring handling place it mid-pack at best among the top sellers in its class.\n\nThe compact SUV class is chock-full of competitive, affordable and useful entries — and even a few fun-to-drive ones, too — so making a splash with a redesigned model is difficult. It has to get noticed, meaning there must be something special enough about it to shake buyers out of a purchasing inertia that pushes them to just buy the latest version of whatever they already own.\n\nGMC is making a play to do just that with its new 2025 Terrain. It’s a complete redesign that replaces the not-terribly-impressive outgoing model with something that’s decidedly stylish, full of the latest tech, and delivers comfort and space aplenty for five people and their stuff.\n\nAs a class, compact SUVs are replacing mid-size family sedans in most Americans’ garages, but the Terrain hasn’t been the model to do so. Has GMC gone far enough in its update of the Terrain to push out the Honda CR-Vs and Toyota RAV4s that have become commonplace in those garages? In some ways yes, in other ways no.\n\nRelated: Redesigned, Single-Trim 2025 GMC Terrain Priced From $31,395\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 GMC Terrain Cost?\n\nOn sale right now, the new 2025 Terrain comes in just one trim level, called Elevation, with front- or all-wheel drive. The prices below include a $1,395 destination charge:\n\nFWD: $31,395\nAWD: $33,395\n\nTwo additional trims are slated to come later this year, including an off-road-oriented AT4 and a more luxurious Denali — two common GMC trim names that (ironically) “elevate” the Terrain in different ways. The AT4 brings some off-road ability thanks to a lifted ride height and some underbody protection, while Denali is GMC’s popular luxury sub-brand that accounts for a significant percentage of the automaker’s sales of vehicles like the Sierra pickup and Yukon SUV. Pricing for the Terrain AT4 and Denali was not available as of publication.\n\nThe price of my loaded AWD Elevation trim came to $40,910, including a Premium Package that added a power driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, rain-sensing wipers, a hands-free power liftgate and simulated leather upholstery. Other options included a panoramic moonroof and the Technology Package, which brought a rearview camera mirror, front foglamps, a 360-degree camera system and rear pedestrian alert. Oddly, a premium audio system isn’t available on the Elevation trim.\n\nThe Terrain’s pricing is pretty dead-on with its competitors, coming in a bit higher than a comparable Chevrolet Equinox (understandable given GMC’s more premium aesthetic) and in the ballpark of the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan. Suffice it to say, the 2025 Terrain Elevation is competitively priced. It remains to be seen whether that will be true of the forthcoming AT4 and Denali.\n\nHow Does the 2025 GMC Terrain Drive?\n\nThe Terrain is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. If you get the FWD model, it’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission and makes 175 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. If you opt for AWD, horsepower stays the same, but torque is bumped to 203 pounds-feet, and the CVT is swapped for a transmission with actual gears: an eight-speed automatic. That’s the transmission my test car had, and just like in the Equinox, it’s the Terrain’s worst feature.\n\n“Lackluster” is the best word to describe this powertrain. Acceleration is tepid; the power band is narrow; and the transmission is slow to kick down when you want more power. A telling sign of GMC’s intent for this engine is the fact that it doesn’t include Sport among its available drive modes, only Normal, Off-Road and Mud/Snow.\n\nAdding to the Terrain’s muddled driving experience is handling that’s squishy and soft instead of solid and precise. The Terrain wanders around in its lane, and turn-in on twisty roads is lazy and soft. There isn’t much in the way of feedback or confidence in the responses the steering and suspension give to the driver. Yes, this is a family SUV with more luxurious pretenses than some rivals in the class, but between its unimpressive acceleration and powertrain responses and its curiously sloppy handling, there isn’t much driving joy to be had in the Terrain.\n\nSo what does it do well? Its ride is supremely comfortable, with a smooth, beautifully absorbent suspension that transmits very few road imperfections to the cabin — and that was in spite of the big optional 19-inch wheels and tires on my test car. The cabin is quiet (unless you’ve floored the accelerator) and serene, exuding a calm, comfortable motoring experience in urban and highway environments. And that’s exactly what most owners will call upon it to do: carry people around with ease. That seems to be exactly what GMC’s engineers have tuned the Terrain for, and in this regard, it behaves very much like other new gas-powered GM SUVs; none have impressive powertrains or sharp handling, but every one I’ve driven has been comfortable, quiet and smooth over varying pavement. If you want athletic and entertaining, go try a CX-5 or even a CR-V. But if your biggest concern is comfort with minimal fuss, the Terrain fits that bill quite well.\n\nDoes the 2025 GMC Terrain Have a Nice Interior?\n\nWhile the Terrain is mechanically identical to the Equinox in terms of the greasy bits underneath its sheet metal, the GMC’s cabin appointments clearly demonstrate why it has a higher price tag. The interior of my Elevation trim felt a bit more upscale than the last Equinox I tested thanks to more premium materials on the dash, doors and seats. That was also due in large part to the massive vertically oriented 15-inch touchscreen in the center of the Terrain’s dashboard. It’s the same one you’ll find in the much larger GMC Acadia SUV, where it also impresses.\n\nThe Terrain’s infotainment system runs the latest Google Built-In operating system, which is in many of GM’s newest vehicles. We find it to be clear and easy to use, with large icons and a useful home screen. And while GMC has moved a lot of the vehicle’s controls into the touchscreen (including the headlights), things that are most frequently used, like climate control and audio volume, still have physical controls. It might be the perfect combination of touchscreen and hard-button controls in a modern vehicle; kudos to GM for continuing to see the value in offering both to minimize driver distraction.\n\nThe only downside to the Terrain’s tech is its astonishingly bad audio system, which has terrible playback quality. As previously mentioned, there’s no premium audio option in the Elevation trim, but hopefully one is in the works for the AT4 or Denali, because the sound system in the Elevation is simply awful.\n\nOne benefit of the 15-inch touchscreen’s squarish layout is that when you fire up Apple CarPlay, it displays in one of the biggest CarPlay views I’ve ever seen. It fills the entire screen, which is quite useful. Combine that with its sharp, reconfigurable 11-inch digital gauge cluster, and the interior of the new Terrain looks and feels truly state-of-the-art. Throw in the premium materials, a plethora of safety features and technology, lots of comfort in the front and rear seats, and plentiful cargo space, and the new Terrain’s interior feels fully competitive with the best in the class.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 GMC Terrain Up Close: Premium Experience in Compact Dimensions\n2025 GMC Terrain: Simpler Lineup, Nicer Digs\n2025 GMC Acadia Review: Do You Really Need a Yukon?\nResearch GMC Vehicles\nShop for a 2025 GMC Terrain Near You\nShould You Buy a 2025 GMC Terrain?\n\nWhen it comes to compact SUVs, the market is chock-full of good options that cover a significant price spread. The Terrain fits in the middle when it comes to price (at least until the Denali arrives) and capability, offering up plenty of tech, lots of comfort, excellent safety systems, and good utility compared with the likes of the CR-V, RAV4 and Rogue. It’s a mild step up from an Equinox, but what holds the Equinox back also prevents the Terrain from reaching class-leading status. Its powertrain is suboptimal and underpowered, and handling is uncharacteristically sloppy for a GM vehicle. If you’re more concerned about comfort and tech, though, than control and acceleration, the Terrain is worth your consideration. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For the 2025 model year, GMC gave its compact Terrain SUV a comprehensive update. Bigger and more spacious inside, with new looks and technology, it’s part of a thorough showroom refresh alongside the larger Acadia three-row SUV and is meant to be a more premium offering than the mechanically identical but less expensive Chevrolet Equinox. But when the redesigned 2025 Terrain launched, you could only get it one way: in base Elevation trim, which while very well equipped, was missing a few things, like a premium leather-trimmed cabin and an off-road version. The luxury Denali and off-road-oriented AT4 trims, which were shown at the Terrain’s debut last year, weren’t available — but they are now. Appearing in showrooms for the 2026 model year, GMC has expanded the Terrain lineup to now include these two more capable, better-equipped and more expensive versions, and we recently took a quick spin around Detroit in both.\n\nRelated: 2025 GMC Terrain Review: Stylish but Slow\n\nHow Much Does the 2026 GMC Terrain Cost?\n\nStarting prices for the AT4 and Denali are significantly higher than the base Elevation, though the two new trims have standard all-wheel drive. (The Elevation has standard front-wheel drive, with AWD a $2,000 option.) The Terrain is imported from Mexico, but GMC representatives have said that the pricing has not been impacted by tariffs — yet. For now, here are the starting prices for the 2026 Terrain (all prices include a $1,395 destination fee):\n\nElevation: $31,295\nAT4: $39,995\nDenali: $42,495\nBig Denali Luxury, Compact SUV Size\n\nGMC’s Denali sub-brand is arguably more popular and more well known than any of the brand’s actual nameplates. It’s meant to convey luxury without being ostentatious (that’s been Cadillac’s purview, until recently). With a starting price that’s more than $11,000 above the Elevation’s, you’d expect it to come with a lot more standard equipment, and it does. AWD is a start, but you also get dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, heated rain-sensing wipers, roof rails, a trailer hitch, headlight animations, a hands-free power liftgate and wireless charging. You also get some subtle styling tweaks, an optional two-tone exterior, a chrome grille and trim, and 19-inch wheels (good-looking 20-inchers are available).\n\nInside, GMC has brought Denali premium trappings to the Terrain with the addition of ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, a power front passenger seat, a 360-degree camera system and a rearview camera mirror with a washer. Leather upholstery is standard, with Denali embroidering in the front head restraints. The effect takes what was already a perfectly nice cabin and turns it into a genuinely luxurious environment — materials feel high quality, colors and shapes look upscale, and the whole thing feels expensive. Of particular note is the available Light Ash Gray/Very Dark Atmosphere interior, which combines a chocolate-brown dash topper and steering wheel with light-gray lower trim; it looks truly dynamite.\n\nDriving the Denali is also quite nice and shows off the sophistication that GMC’s chassis engineers have brought to the Terrain. Despite my test vehicle’s big 20-inch wheels, ride quality is superb — even on Detroit’s broken pavement. It’s a calm, quiet environment in the Terrain Denali, meant to provide a lovely, luxurious driving experience. The steering wheel feels thick in the hand, and steering feel and feedback is perfectly adequate for an SUV. The 15-inch portrait-style touchscreen running GM’s latest Google-based operating system also works well and is augmented with hard buttons (thankfully) along its lower edge for frequently used functions like temperature and climate controls.\n\nWhere the Denali (and the Terrain overall, as well as GM’s latest engines in general, to be honest) falls down is in its powertrain tuning. It’s powered by the same anemic turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 175 horsepower and 203 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a selectable AWD system that only activates if you’ve pushed a button.\n\nAround town, it’s got just a little pep to it, but the transmission is slow to downshift; accelerator response is lazy; and when you really put your foot in it for highway on-ramps and the like, there simply isn’t any grunt to be had. It runs out of steam pretty quickly and is just not powerful enough for a vehicle this size. The fact that the Denali and AT4 both come with a standard trailer hitch is a little mind-boggling — I can’t imagine towing anything with this engine. Not that the towing capacity is all that high: 1,500 pounds for an AWD model or just 800 pounds for a FWD one. You’re not really even rewarded with great fuel economy with this engine, as the Denali and AT4 are both rated 24/26/25 mpg city/highway/combined. In our recent 2025 Compact SUV Challenge, a Chevrolet Equinox with this powertrain got 27.6 mpg, which was the lowest observed gas mileage of the seven SUVs in the test.\n\nThat AT4 Capability\n\nIf you prefer your SUV with rugged flavor instead of luxury trimmings, the AT4 is an interesting choice. Unlike the last Terrain AT4, which was nothing more than a trim-and-tire package, the new one actually has a bit more equipment to survive a foray into the bush. It starts with a plastic skid plate up front that melds into a steel underbody plate to protect the oily parts. It also has 17-inch wheels with all-terrain rubber, suitable for mild forays in the rough. Inside, there’s a trim-specific interior with embroidered AT4 logos in place of Denali ones. The Off-Road drive mode is augmented by a Terrain mode, which acts as a low-speed, “one pedal” off-road cruise control for slow, controlled wheeling in the dirt. The AT4 sits about a half-inch higher and has an off-road tune to its suspension.\n\nThe only driving difference between the AT4 and the Denali comes from the change in wheel size and tires. The AT4’s chunky treads and taller tire sidewalls result in a floatier ride and less responsive steering, while the less pavement-friendly tread pattern creates a bit more road noise in the otherwise very nicely hushed cabin. Neither trait is unpleasant or intrusive, but the idea that you’re going to go very far afield in a Terrain AT4 is a bit of a fallacy — it’s still really meant more for looking tough than being tough. You’d need a bit more protection underneath, a bit more ground clearance, and better approach and departure angles to do any serious wheeling off-pavement, but the AT4 should be more than adequate to get you down a two-track to your favorite off-grid state park campsite.\n\nShould You Buy a 2026 GMC Terrain?\n\nFor people looking for a nicer version of the mechanically similar Chevrolet Equinox, the Terrain will be a nice upgrade. But you’ll buy it for the improved cabin materials, the larger 15-inch touchscreen and the status that comes with a Denali badge, not for any significant mechanical upgrades over the Equinox. GM could use another run-through on the powertrain, but prior conversations with GM executives leave us with the understanding that the automaker feels its customers don’t really much care what’s under the hood as much as what’s surrounding them in the cabin, so that’s where it has spent its money and efforts. If that describes you, then the Terrain will be right up your alley.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Much Is the 2026 GMC Terrain?\n2025 GMC Terrain Up Close: Premium Experience in Compact Dimensions\n2025 GMC Terrain: Simpler Lineup, Nicer Digs\nResearch GMC Vehicles\nShop for a 2026 GMC Terrain Near You\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Despite a supposed update for 2016, this year’s GMC Terrain compact SUV hasn’t caught up with the competition.\n\nVersus the competition: A compact SUV that could almost be considered a midsize, the Terrain pays off with a large cargo area and a roomy backseat, but most competitors simply get up and go more quickly and are easier to park when you’re done.\n\nIt’s also fallen behind the class with a multimedia setup that had me relying on my phone more than I should in a $40,000-plus SUV. And its safety options aren’t as advanced as others in the class.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Terrain is related to the Chevrolet Equinox, but where the Chevrolet has more curves and angles, the Terrain is much blockier. It’s a good, rugged look and helps the little SUV appear bigger than it really is. Because, while the Terrain is bigger than compact SUVs such as the Kia Sportage, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester, the specs indicate it’s only a few inches larger here or there.\n\nFor 2016, some trims have a new grille with stacked frames, and GMC also redesigned the textured grille of Denali trims.\nHow It Drives\nThe Terrain does not offer an exciting driving experience.  That in itself is fine — not every vehicle needs to be a sports car — but the Terrain’s performance really lags behind the rest of the class. It’s very slow away from the line and the steering is heavy. One trip around the block and it’s clear that it lags behind the RAV4, Forester and especially the peppy and redesigned 2017 Sportage.\n\nWe had the optional 301-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6, which makes 51 more horsepower than the next-most-powerful competitor (the Forester with its optional 250-hp four-cylinder), so the numbers indicate there’s more grunt under the hood than you feel. It suggests that the V-6 has been tuned in favor of mpg rather than power, and more than one editor suggested that a Sport mode would go a long way toward eliminating that perceived lack of power.\n\nOn the highway, you notice the V-6’s grunt in a good way. It’s able to cruise at higher speeds without the engine making as much noise as the competitors. It doesn’t seem to be working very hard when you’re cruising in the 65 mph range. The Forester, RAV4 and Sportage are unable to match the hushed experience of the Terrain, which also exhibits limited wind noise – a surprise, given the Terrain’s blockiness.\n\nOverall, the Terrain is a very comfortable car on the highway. In addition to the hushed cabin, the ride is among the best – easily superior to the Forester and RAV4 and more comfortable than the Sportage. Only the Honda CR-V, the winner of our 2015 Compact SUV Challenge, is able to match it for ride refinement. (The Terrain has since been updated in some respects, but I can say as a judge from that Challenge that the driving experience is unchanged.)\n\nBut when you get off the highway and go to park the Terrain, you’ll notice immediately that the turning circle is very wide. Depending on the wheel size, the specs indicate the Terrain needs anywhere from about 3 feet to almost 8 feet to complete the circle compared with the Sportage, RAV4 and Forester, but it feels like more. It’s noticeable in every parking situation that I came across, no matter if it was in a garage or in the open field of a forest preserve. It’s deal-breakingly bad for me.\n\nThe GMC Terrain Denali with the V-6 and all-wheel drive like we tested is rated an estimated 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined. The Terrain also is available as a V-6 with two-wheel drive (17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined) and with a four-cylinder engine. Four-cylinder models get 22/32/26 mpg with front-wheel drive and 20/29/23 mpg with all-wheel drive.\nInterior\nThe Denali trim level that we tested includes standard leather seats and leather-appointed door inserts as well as some wood-trim accents. The wood trim is subtle and suits the Terrain. The seats drew praise for their comfort not only from me, but also from other reviewers.\n\nInterior room is another area where the Terrain shines: Up front, the center console is large enough to be useful, but not so large that it cramps the occupants. But the real winner is the backseat. The seat both reclines and slides forward and back, but more importantly, there’s enough room to sit back there comfortably, even if you and the occupant sitting in front of you are tall. I’d go so far as to say the rear seats in the Terrain are the most comfortable in the class.\n\nAfter that, the Terrain starts to struggle…\n\nFor starters, those rear seats better be comfortable, because there are no amenities — such as climate controls or vents — for passengers, and the armrest cupholders are only decent.\n\nUp front, the materials on the door — especially the molded plastic of the lower door — didn’t quite measure up to the rest of the interior quality. Further, the chrome trim of the gearshift didn’t look or feel like metal and reflected an annoying glare on any sunny day. It felt like a tacked-on extra.\n\nThe same goes for the dashboard’s center control panel: It didn’t look integrated and, on the whole, there were so many buttons that it just didn’t look like a compact SUV aimed at luxury buyers – as a Denali model should.\n\nOutward visibility is pinched due to the wide A-pillars and rear pillars. Those rear windows, combined with the wide turning circle, only added to the parking challenges in the Terrain.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThis area rivals the Terrain’s turning circle for “Most Annoying” aspect. Simply put, the multimedia system and navigation trail the class both in usability and usefulness.\n\nFor starters, there’s both a touch-screen and a series of buttons on the dashboard to control many of the same functions. The buttons are somewhat easier to use because they’re grouped logically — climate controls together, audio controls together — but it’s still too hard to figure out which button to hit. And the display is sometimes too sensitive to the touch, yet can take too long to respond once the touch registers, particularly when inputting destinations into the navigation system. Furthermore, some editors pointed out that using the touch-screen itself wasn’t a joy, as it was far away from the driver’s seat and oddly angled in such a way that it was too easy to hit the rough surface of the hood that shields the display from sunlight.\n\nIt also takes too many steps to do something simple, such as switching from satellite radio to FM or an MP3 player and the like. GM has always mitigated this with a class-leading radio that lets you store presets regardless of FM/AM/XM band, but it hasn’t kept up with the times, as streaming music apps and phones-as-musical-storage-devices are easily as important today.\n\nFurther, the navigation system let me down on three occasions. First, it incorrectly located the entrance to a forest preserve (something my phone did correctly); second, it couldn’t accurately determine whether I was on the highway or frontage road; third, it gave directions that didn’t correlate with the layout of the highway I was on. (Had I taken the exit the navigation suggested, it would have involved crashing through a guardrail and falling 50 feet.) All in all, I found myself wanting to use my phone through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but these features are not offered in the Terrain, even though they’re proliferating throughout GM’s vehicles.\n\nOwing to the layout, the size of icons and the fact that the submenus do little to make things less complicated, the Terrain’s 7-inch screen seems smaller than it really is. A small screen doesn’t necessarily make for poor viewing, but in this case, the screen is just too distant and cluttered. Again I wanted to use my phone, not the system. It’s doubly interesting because GMC’s parent company GM — noticeably in its 2016 Chevrolet Malibu — has shown it knows how to make a multimedia system work effectively and be appealing. They just missed with the Terrain.\n\nFinally, on the highest trim level, not having keyless access and keyless start just doesn’t cut it in 2016, especially on a car that has a sticker price of more than $40,000.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Terrain has a very large, very useful cargo area. It’s not so high off the ground that I think shorter people will have difficulty, and it manages to be both wide and deep, which allowed me to pack a lot of stuff for my weekend camping trip. What’s interesting is that the specs indicate the Terrain cargo area isn’t the biggest of the RAV4/Forester/Sportage set, but this is a case where the specs don’t always tell the full story. I’ve always found the RAV4 to have a very good cargo area that can accommodate a wide variety of objects, but the Forester seems to be a touch narrower than the rest, and the Sportage is OK but not quite as useful as the Terrain and RAV4.\n\nCabin storage is good, with four cupholders up front; a deep, wide center console bin; and a nice-sized cubby underneath the multimedia system that I found myself using consistently through the course of my test.\nSafety\nThe 2016 GMC Terrain received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good in its crash tests.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and our test model had the optional rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning and forward collision warning that kicks in at speeds greater than 25 mph. All worked well, in that they weren’t overly sensitive or so annoying that I wanted to turn them off. You can browse the safety features here.\n\nHowever, the Terrain does not offer forward automatic emergency braking or active lane departure prevention. In this way, it trails the Forester, RAV4 and Sportage as those cars offer at least forward automatic emergency braking. However, only the RAV4 also has active lane departure prevention.\nValue in Its Class\nThe safety options are the best reflection of where the Terrain stands in the market: Others offer more, and what they offer is more advanced. When it made its debut, more than a few of us were impressed with the Terrain, but just as forward collision warning has been surpassed by forward collision prevention, so has been the Terrain by its rivals.\n\nThe Terrain still excels with its ride and interior room. If I had to schlep three big, tall adults from where we’re based in Chicago to, say, Omaha, the Terrain would be at the top of my list. And if you’re part of a family of big, tall people, you already know there’s no substitute for interior cubic feet. That space, its hushed cabin and smooth ride would be most welcome.\n\nHowever, that’s a pretty narrow range for a vehicle to perform in. Aside from the room and ride, the Terrain has been left behind in practically every other way. That we say this of a model that was updated for this model year is all the more damning.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "OK class. We’ve got a lot of ground to cover today. However, instead of ground, let’s make that a lot of “terrain to cover,” as in the 2010 GMC Terrain crossover, today’s test vehicle.\n\nThe Terrain is the GMC version of the Chevrolet Equinox. Given the proliferation of new models and the fact GMC models are siblings of other General Motors, it takes time for new models to establish brand recognition.\n\nThis one is worth getting some of that recognition and should be on your “to consider” list if you’re in the market for a small SUV. Terrain stands out especially for its 4-cylinder “Ecotec” engine that returns an EPA estimated 32 miles per gallon (highway) in the front-wheel-drive version and 29 mpg in the all-wheel-drive version that we tested.\n\nOur test vehicle averaged 26.2 mpg in a variety of driving that included commuting to Boston and local shopping excursions. And that was without using the “Eco” mode, turned on by a button on the center console. That system works by lowering the torque converter lockup to 1,125 rpm. Coupled with an 18-gallon fuel tank, the Terrain can boast of a 576-mile cruising range (front-wheel-drive) or 522-mile range (all-wheel-drive). It also uses regular gas.\n\nThe four, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, was smooth and capable. It didn’t resort to annoying downshifts on hills and had enough oomph for passing, on-ramp accelerating, and lane changes. The Terrain, with 6.9 inches of ground clearance, is a suburban hauler – quiet on the highway, but a bit noisier on rough roads.\n\nStarting price for the Terrain in SLT-1 trim with all-wheel-drive is $29,500. Standard equipment includes six airbags, stability control, anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring system, OnStar, air conditioning, fog lamps, and a rear-vision camera system. GM gets kudos for making the rear-view camera not only standard but also separate from the optional $2,145 navigation system that wasn’t on our test SUV.\n\nAlso standard were steering wheel audio controls, automatic climate control, premium Pioneer sound system, heated leather seats, and 18-inch machined aluminum wheels.\n\nOur test vehicle priced out at $32,325 with options, including the sunroof ($795), trailering package ($350), carbon black metallic paint ($195), cargo management system ($245), power programmable rear liftgate ($495) and $745 destination charge. That liftgate can be set to open all the way, making it easy for six-footers to avoid whacking their heads, or only three-quarters of a lift so the gate won’t whack a garage ceiling, or the power feature can be turned off altogether. The adjustment knob is on the overhead front console; plus there’s a power button on the gate itself for lowering.\n\nMrs. G, not knowing that the carbon black metallic was an optional color, took one look at it and said, “That’s a nice color and a nice paint job with the metal flakes in it.”\n\nAnother of the many things GM did right with the Terrain was legroom. There’s plenty for both front and rear-seat passengers. That cuts down on luggage space. The Terrain has 31.6 cubic feet, the same as the Nissan Murano but less than the Ford Edge (32.2), Honda CR-V (35.7), and Hyundai Santa Fe (34.2). Still, there’s plenty of room for most things, and the 60/40 reclining and sliding rear seat folds quickly and almost flat for larger items.\n\nMrs. G replaced what we always thought was an 8×10 rug during the Terrain’s visit. The old rug was sent off to the thrift shop. It fit in the Terrain with one end poking between the front seats. A quick check with a tape measure showed the old rug actually was 7-feet, 4-inches long. Still, that’s a good length to fit in a small SUV.\n\nAt first glance the Terrain looks bigger than its listed 185.3 inches of overall length. That’s 5.4 inches shorter than a Nissan Altima, for example. Part of the initial impression of the Terrain is that it’s immense, partly because of the steep front fascia with trademark GMC logo and three-element black grille set off with a chrome border.\n\nThere are plenty of bins and cubbies, including a dashboard-top compartment with a rubber liner and very deep box under the center console armrest.\n\nOur Terrain’s leather upholstery was two-tone charcoal and light gray with red stitching. It looked overly contrasted when the vehicle was empty but nice ‘n homey when the car had a normal amount of “stuff” in it.\n\nThe center console also had USB and auxiliary plugs. The center stack is slanted away from the driver, making the steering wheel controls a welcome addition. The upgraded sound system / XM radio has enough options for all. Even though there were 36 possible presets, I enjoyed being able to have my favorite six (3 AM, 2 FM, 1 XM) in the same grouping, not having to change bands or “favorites grouping” before hitting a preset.\n\nAll the instrument lighting is a warm reddish tone and the fuel and engine temperature gauges are airplane style (needles pointing down instead of up). That’s towards the ground the Terrain covers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 GMC Terrain? \n\nThe GMC Terrain is a compact SUV with seating for five. It’s powered by a 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on SLE and SLT trims; the off-road-themed AT4 and range-topping Denali trims have standard AWD. Direct rivals to the Terrain are numerous and include the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Mazda CX-5, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 GMC Terrain? \n\nThe Terrain rolls into the 2024 model year with two new available exterior colors — Downpour Metallic and Riptide Metallic — but no significant changes otherwise. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 GMC Terrain Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nFour USB ports\nSatellite radio\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after initial trial)\nSix-speaker audio system\nRear-seat reminder\nLane departure steering assist \nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nHands-free power liftgate\nRemote start\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nPanoramic sunroof\nSemi-automated parking-assist feature\n360-degree camera system\n19-inch wheels \nShould I Buy the 2024 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe 2024 GMC Terrain is a decent choice for anyone looking for a compact SUV with plenty of passenger and cargo space. Its fold-flat front passenger seat is especially handy when it comes to hauling bulky items. Its 175-hp turbo four-cylinder, however, provides only mediocre acceleration, and it’s middle of the pack at best among numerous rivals when it comes to fuel economy. On the plus side, the AT4 trim delivers a handsomely rugged exterior, and the upscale Denali provides a notable improvement in the Terrain’s interior quality and design.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that seats five. It has a standard 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. GMC’s upscale Denali trim is offered, and last year, an off-road-look AT4 trim joined the line. Terrain competitors include the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe Terrain’s engine gets a 5-hp bump over last year’s 170-hp setup. An electronic brake-assist feature helps sharpen stopping behavior, and a Black Diamond Edition Package for the Denali adds features such as dark-finished alloy wheels, a 360-degree camera system and a panoramic moonroof.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 GMC Terrain Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial)\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nRemote start\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nPanoramic moonroof\nSemi-automated parking-assist feature\n360-degree camera system\n19-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe GMC Terrain a decent, versatile compact SUV with an easy-to-use multimedia system. The AT4 trim is more about looking rugged than having truly enhanced off-road capability (an underbody skid plate is its only real functional upgrade), but it still offers a distinctive look and feel, as does the ritzy Denali.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that seats five. It’s powered by a 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. Competitors include the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Volkswagen Tiguan. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 GMC Terrain?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 GMC Terrain Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPush-button start\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning \nAutomatic emergency braking \nLane-keeping assist \nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free liftgate\nRemote start\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\n2021 GMC Terrain Vs. 2021 Honda CR-V: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe GMC Terrain and Honda CR-V have similar starting prices for base front-wheel-drive models, but the CR-V is more efficient: Its EPA rating is 30 mpg combined, while the Terrain is rated 27 mpg. Both small SUVs have relatively firm suspensions, but the Terrain’s ride quality feels more refined. With the Terrain’s addition of more active-safety features last year, the two SUVs are more similar in this all-important area. The CR-V does have standard adaptive cruise control, however, which is optional on the Terrain. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 GMC Terrain?\n\nIf you’re looking for a refined, versatile compact SUV with an easy-to-use multimedia system, the Terrain is worth a look. Last year’s addition of more  standard active-safety features enhances its overall value in the very crowded small SUV class.",

      "expert_review": "Rarely do I put more than 1,000 miles on a test car, but that’s what happened when the 2012 GMC Terrain came into my hands.\n\nThe verdict? Any vehicle that can keep me as happy, as free of back pain and as entertained as the 2012 GMC Terrain did for a thousand miles should win an award.\n\nActually, the Terrain’s twin, the Chevy Equinox, did win Cars.com’s $29,000 Shootout. My GMC tester cost significantly more than that, but still delivered a lot of value.\n\nWhat’s New\nLaunched in 2010, the Terrain offers just a few updates for 2012, but what’s striking is that the crossover didn’t need much fixing. (See the two model years compared here.) The Terrain comes relatively well-equipped in its base, SLE trim level, which starts at $25,560. For 2012, the Terrain’s new standard features are technology-focused, including a new standard audio system with SiriusXM satellite radio, a 7-inch touch-screen and a USB input. Bluetooth, cruise control and OnStar remain standard.\n\nOther new standard features include a backup camera whose image appears in the 7-inch display instead of the rearview mirror.\n\nThis higher level of standard features justifies the Terrain’s higher starting price versus the Chevy Equinox’s $23,530.\n\nPerformance\nWhether you pick the four- or the six-cylinder engine, you’ll get a competent power plant, but not one that will stand out. My V-6, front-wheel-drive test vehicle had plenty of power to get up to speed on the highway, but the six-speed automatic wasn’t as smooth as others in this class. For most drivers, though, it likely will not be an issue.\n\nWe’ve had issues with the estimated mileage of the four-cylinder engine in the Chevy Equinox; it rarely reached the EPA’s 22/32 mpg city/highway numbers. The V-6 Terrain, over a thousand-plus-mile road trip, rarely dropped below the EPA’s 24 mpg highway rating. That was with just me and a suitcase, in cool weather — between 20 and 40 degrees — across flat land with a 70 mph speed limit most of the way.\n\nLong cruises were where I really appreciated the Terrain’s quiet, comfortable ride. This type of ride is one reason automakers have shifted from a traditional SUV chassis to a more carlike one in crossovers like the Terrain.\n\nIn the Terrain, the move is welcome. My longest stretch of driving was nine hours, from Chicago to Toronto. Even during that drive, my back never became sore. The leather seats in the SLT trim were comfortable, with plenty of lumbar and thigh support. In comparison, I drove a smaller compact crossover on a particularly long commute, and my back was aching after an hour. Everyone’s body is different, but the comfort level of the Terrain and Equinox has been praised by other Cars.com editors as well.\n\nBecause of the spotty mileage issues with the four-cylinder and the reasonable $1,400 upgrade to the V-6, I recommend shoppers move up — something I’ve done less frequently lately, as four-cylinders across the industry have steadily improved.\n\nFeatures & Technology\nIn every model except the base, SLE-1, adding a navigation system (which displays on the 7-inch touch-screen) costs just $795 — a relative bargain, given most systems cost well above $1,000 as stand-alone options or even more as part of option packages.\n\nI simply loved the multimedia and navigation system in the Terrain. It utilized the best of the touch-screen world as well as having physical buttons and knobs. I probably wouldn’t rave as much about this mix of controls if it weren’t for the fact that Ford relies on touch-sensitive panels that have irked our staff recently. The layout and screen clarity are a bit cleaner than that of the new Honda CR-V, but it’s a close call.\n\niPod integration in the Terrain is flawless. This, combined with the upgraded sound system, put me in music geek heaven as I crossed state and international borders. Its Bluetooth pairing was simple and effortless, but most manufacturers have perfected this. I found the nav system to be above average, as well. I particularly liked the ability to display navigation cues in the small LCD screen in the gauge cluster, supplementing the map on the touch-screen. That was a good place to see the mileage tick down before a necessary exit or freeway exchange.\n\nI’m not one for voice controls, as a few simple button clicks seem more intuitive and faster, but the Terrain’s work about as well as Ford’s Sync voice recognition system and the new system from Honda.\n\nForward collision alert and lane departure warning systems were also on my tester. At just $295 as a bundled option on the highest, SLT-2 trim — the only version on which they’re available — they seem like a bargain, especially if you do a lot of bumper-to-bumper driving (for the former) or long stretches using cruise control (for the latter). These systems were introduced just a few years ago on luxury models, and it’s nice to see them available on an affordable model at a very affordable price.\n\nVersus the Competition\nThe tough thing for the Terrain — and the Equinox — is where they fit among the competition. They’re larger on the outside than traditional compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 but offer less interior and cargo volume. They’re more expensive, too. They’re slightly smaller (but less expensive) than full-size crossovers and SUVs like the Ford Edge and Nissan Murano, both of which can be had with power plants I prefer to GM’s.\n\nThe Dodge Journey was recently refreshed and is the most similar to the two GM products in terms of size and pricing, but the Terrain tops it in terms of performance and tech features.\n\nSee the Terrain compared with similarly equipped competitive models here.\n\nUnlike some of the competition, the Terrain features a sliding second row, which is a crowd-pleasing feature when you’re taking friends to dinner and don’t mind losing cargo space by sliding the backseat rearward.\n\nBut that lack of cargo volume is substantial. I’m glad they don’t call it an SUV, because there isn’t much utility in the Terrain. At 31.6 cubic feet, the cargo area is significantly smaller than the CR-V’s 37.2 cubic feet or the Journey’s 39.6 cubic feet, and it’s just a smidge behind the Edge’s 32.2 cubic feet. The bigger issue with the Terrain is that the cargo area is particularly narrow, so items like golf bags and strollers have a hard time fitting horizontally across the back.\n\nThis limits the Terrain’s value to families with small kids, given the equipment they require. For those looking for a car to do standard hauling jobs, like grocery store trips or discount-club shopping runs — sans passengers — it will do the trick.\n\nSafety\nThe Terrain was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the organization’s highest crash rating. It scored four stars out of five in the federal government’s overall crash rating. In individual government tests, it earned four stars in frontal crashes, five stars in side-impact tests and a four-star rollover rating.\n\nYou can find all the Terrain’s safety features here.\n\nTerrain in the Market\nThe Terrain — along with the Equinox — is a terrific option for compact-crossover shoppers who want a more substantial feel out of their ride. It also packs all the current technology and safety features you would want in a car in this segment and price range.\n\nSince it debuted in 2010, the Terrain has been a sales hit. Even with just a few minor upgrades, it should remain popular in 2012.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2009 about the 2010 GMC Terrain. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that the new GMC Terrain, a corporate twin to the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox, retains most of its sibling’s strengths and weaknesses. The wild card — or, more appropriately, the elephant in the design studio — is the Terrain’s styling. If it works for you, the Terrain is every bit as competitive as the Equinox. One caveat, however: Unless you need the towing capacity, avoid the V-6. The Terrain shows its best colors in four-cylinder form.\n\nIn ascending order, trim levels are the SLE1, SLE2, SLT1 and SLT2. All four come standard with the four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional on any trim, and the V-6 is optional on all but the SLE1. On each trim, you get a little added content if you choose the GMC version versus the Chevy, which accounts for the Terrain’s higher price. I drove a front-wheel-drive V-6 SLT1, though I’ve driven both engines in the mechanically identical Equinox, which you can compare to the Terrain here.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nHaving driven both the four-cylinder and V-6 Equinox, I can attest that the difference in power isn’t appreciable unless you’re pushing the car hard or carrying a load of people. My V-6 Terrain drove the point home: With 264 horsepower on tap — and no all-wheel drive to weigh things down — I’d expect a bit more oomph, especially given that competitors like the V-6 Toyota RAV4 feel downright fleet-footed. The Terrain does, however, weigh a few hundred pounds more, and so it lumbers along at a more leisurely pace.\n\nThat lumbering can be an issue. A six-speed automatic is standard, but it isn’t exactly the paragon of responsiveness. Kickdown takes too long at any speed, and it’s often accompanied by uncertain gear hunting. I also noticed a vexing case of accelerator lag. It has a way of creeping up on you: Acceleration from stoplights was acceptable, but when driving around 30-40 mph it occasionally took a full second for the Terrain to respond to my right foot. I’d invariably respond by stabbing the gas pedal harder, and when the cavalry finally arrived I’d get overkill.\n\nIf anything, the 182-hp four-cylinder should have enough power for most drivers. I didn’t detect any of the V-6’s accelerator lag in the four-cylinder Equinox I tested, and the pedal felt tuned for quicker response. Overly responsive accelerators are an old trick for a lot of four-cylinder cars — and a short-lived one, when you need sustained power up an on-ramp — but I never found the base Equinox gutless. The same should be true of its GMC sibling.\n\nGMC and Chevrolet have Toyota — and everyone else, for that matter — beat in four-cylinder gas mileage. With an impressive 22/32 mpg city/highway with the four-cylinder and front-wheel drive, the Terrain beats all competitors with similar configurations. Adding all-wheel drive or the V-6 knocks mileage down quite a bit; at that point, the Terrain ranks midpack.\n\nGas Mileage (combined city/highway, mpg)\n \tAll-wheel drive\tFront-wheel drive\n2010 Toyota RAV4\t21 – 24\t22 – 24\n2010 Honda CR-V\t23\t24\n2010 Nissan Rogue\t23\t24\n2010 GMC Terrain\t20 – 23\t20 – 26\n2009 Subaru Forester*\t21 – 22\t—\n2010 Ford Escape\t20 – 22\t21 – 24\n2009 Hyundai Santa Fe\t19\t20\n*Forester with turbo engine requires premium fuel. All others use regular.\nSource: EPA data; variances are due to various transmissions and engines offered.\n\n \n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but the pedal has a mushy, trucklike feel, so smooth stops can take some practice. On the upside, suspension dive while braking is fairly minimal.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the four-cylinder Terrain can tow 1,500 pounds. The V-6 tows a competitive 3,500 pounds.\n\nNoise, Ride & Handling\nA defining attribute of GM’s latest crossovers is improved noise insulation. Road and wind noise are hushed, leaving the cabin exceptionally quiet — at least until you hit a bump. The suspension isn’t a particularly quiet one — it responds to potholes and expansion joints with loud, echoing noises — and, as we noted in the Equinox review, some may find the ride too firm overall.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with light effort at low speeds; it firms up progressively as you reach highway speeds, but I still found it a bit loose at 70 mph. Take an off-ramp quickly, and the Terrain has carlike resistance to body roll. Unfortunately, patches of rough pavement belie any cornering confidence: Steering response becomes sloppy, giving the Terrain a floaty sensation of being disconnected from the road. It reminds me more of traditional truck-based SUVs than car-based crossovers, to which the Terrain and its Chevy cohort belong.\n\nThe Elephant\nGMC has long combined ruggedness and elegance to good effect — consider the Sierra pickup and Acadia crossover, for example. But the Terrain is one odd duck. GM says it shares just a few body panels with the Equinox; I wish it shared more. The Equinox has similar lines to Chevy’s larger Traverse, but the Terrain looks little like the Traverse’s GMC sibling — and arguably GM’s best-looking crossover — the Acadia. The Terrain’s styling feels ham-handed and forced. When I heard GMC would build an Equinox twin, I hoped to see a scaled-down Acadia. Color me disappointed.\n\nPerhaps I’m being too harsh. A friend said he didn’t find the Terrain nearly as overdone as I did. Senior editor David Thomas, who lives in the Chicago suburbs, took the Terrain home over a weekend and noted that in such environs it looked much more at home. “Besides the huge gaps under the square wheel wells,” Thomas said, “I thought it was one good-looking truck when it was in my driveway. The huge grille looks much better in person, and in dark colors the Terrain can be quite striking. I can see it definitely turning on the truck crowd.”\n\nContrast that to multimedia editor Eric Rossi, who likened the Terrain to a modern-day Pontiac Aztek. Now that’s harsh.\n\nThe Inside\nSUV fans should find plenty of familiar goodies: a high seating position, excellent forward sightlines — albeit a hefty blind spot in back — and room to stretch out. I found our tester’s leather seats reasonably comfortable, and they sit high enough off the floor to afford ample thigh support. There’s also plenty of common-sense functionality, from a speedometer marked in 10-mph increments — easier to tell your speed on the fly than the usual 20-mph markers — to a number of large storage areas and a user-friendly stereo.\n\nInterior quality is midpack for this class. Cabin materials look good, but padded surfaces in areas you regularly touch — door panels, for instance — are in short supply, and too many buttons among the center controls have the brittle, uneven quality GM has finally banished in other models. What’s more, storage cubbies along our tester’s doors had sharp, unfinished ridges across their inside surfaces. That’s the sort of thing GM could iron out down the line, so be sure to check during your test drive.\n\nThe backseat has plenty of room. It’s adjustable forward and back, with a nifty plastic panel that keeps the cargo floor gap-free no matter where you position the seat. Like the Equinox, the Terrain posts middling cargo volume: 31.6 cubic feet behind the second row and 63.9 cubic feet with the seats folded. Here’s how those figures compare:\n\nCargo Volume (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind 2nd row\tBehind 1st row\n2010 Toyota RAV4*\t36.4\t73.0\n2010 Honda CR-V\t35.7\t72.9\n2009 Hyundai Santa Fe*\t34.2\t78.2\n2009 Subaru Forester\t33.5\t68.3\n2010 GMC Terrain\t31.6\t63.9\n2010 Ford Escape\t31.4\t67.2\n2010 Nissan Rogue\t28.9\t57.9\n*Specs for models without optional third rows.\nSource: Automaker data\n\nIn real-world use, the problem with the cargo area is how narrow it is. “I tried to empty out my storage area and I could only fit one large plastic bin in the back with the rear seats up,” Thomas said. “My wife was pretty blunt in her assessment: ‘What good is an SUV if it can’t fit anything big in the back?'”\n\nSafety & Features\nWith the top score, Good, in frontal, side and rear impacts by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Terrain and Equinox have both been named IIHS Top Safety Picks. That’s commendable, though it doesn’t put the Terrain at a competitive advantage: All six major competitors are also IIHS Top Safety Picks. Standard safety features on the Terrain include six airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list.\n\nStandard features on the four-cylinder SLE1 include a six-speed automatic, a CD stereo with full USB/iPod integration, cruise control, air conditioning and a backup camera. Prices start at $24,250 — $1,810 more than the base Equinox LS, and on the higher end for this crowd — but the Terrain’s robust standard-features list beats a lot of others’, Equinox included.\n\nStep up to higher trims, and you can get automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, steering-wheel audio controls, a moonroof, a navigation system and heated leather seats. On any trim, all-wheel drive adds $1,750. The V-6 runs $1,500 on all but the SLE1, where it isn’t available. Otherwise, you don’t have to have one to get the other.\n\nLoad up an all-wheel-drive SLT2, and the Terrain can top $36,000.\n\nGMC Terrain in the Market\nWith the Equinox and Terrain, GM stands to regain some lost share in the crossover market — if for no other reason than 32 mpg in an SUV is no small feat. The Terrain is competitive otherwise, but its overwrought styling might prove the greatest hindrance to attracting new GMC shoppers. On the other hand, it may be just what truck lovers — and maybe some former Hummer owners — will gravitate toward as traditional truck-based SUVs continue to go the way of the dinosaurs.\n\nBoth of these new GM crossovers are worth a look — and, provided they turn up decent reliability scores down the road, they’re proof positive that a leaner GM can still throw some punches.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 GMC Terrain is a bulkier alternative to the small SUVs it’s priced against, and that plays out in both good and bad ways.\n\nAge always seems to play up an SUV’s lack of competitiveness, but the Terrain’s strengths run deep. Despite having had five years to try, competitors haven’t outflanked this SUV’s core talents just yet. Conversely, the Terrain’s bungles are as annoying as ever, and it will take a full redesign to address some of them.\n\nThis is the sixth model year for the Terrain, which comes in six trim levels, with two available engines and front- or all-wheel drive. Click here to compare AWD and FWD or here to stack up the 2014 and 2015 Terrain. The Terrain is closely related to the Chevrolet Equinox, and you can compare the two here. We drove both body-type SUVs with similar features at Cars.com’s $28,000 Compact SUV Challenge, which you can see here.\n\nFor 2015, the Terrain gets some new multimedia technology, but other changes are minimal. We’ll touch on specific attributes of the Terrain below; for a deeper dive, read our Equinox review here.\n\nWe drove a front-wheel-drive Terrain SLE-1. Other trim options include the SLT (SLT-1 and SLT-2), and the top-of-the-line Denali trim level.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBlockier than its Equinox sibling, the GMC Terrain’s styling has always looked fierce to me. Still, some editors appreciate the distinction; the Terrain’s protruding fenders and squared-off face hide a lot of its similarity with the Equinox. Fog lights and 17-inch alloy wheels are standard; 18s or 19s are optional. The Terrain’s range-topping Denali trim gets a unique chrome grille, some additional mirror brightwork and Denali-specific 18s or 19s.\n\nLike the Equinox, the Terrain is a few inches larger than similarly priced SUVs — popular models like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape. That could make parking a chore, especially because the GMC’s turning circle ranges from 40 feet to an embarrassing 42.6 feet, depending on the wheels. (A RAV4 cuts the circle in as little as 34.8 feet.)\n\nHow It Drives\nThe half-size-bigger approach helps driving refinement, where the GMC cruises with a degree of ride quality and noise abatement that’s a class above its peers. Still, once the road gets curvy, the Terrain’s mushy brakes and wallow-prone suspension sap much fun; so did our test car’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder, whose 182 horsepower isn’t up to the task of slinging around the SUV’s portly weight.\n\nAn optional 301-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 solves that problem and then some, giving the Terrain the sort of snappy acceleration we haven’t seen since Toyota dropped the V-6 from its RAV4. It sucks fuel, though, returning just 19 to 20 mpg in combined EPA-rated fuel economy. Four-cylinder models are rated 23 to 26 mpg, depending on driveline – AWD tends to be less fuel efficient; many competitors, however, have surpassed even those numbers. Both engine options are paired to a six-speed auto transmission.\n\nInterior\nAside from the Denali edition, which dresses things up with some contrasting door trim and dashboard stitching, the Terrain’s interior is straightforward. Cabin materials are basic, with low-budget paneling in places where competitors have used nicer materials, like the upper door panels.\n\nStill, GMC comes out ahead in passenger space, with large chairs and backseat legroom to spare. Cloth seats with powered driver’s-seat height adjustment are standard; heated leather-wrapped seats are optional, with full power adjustments for the passenger seat, too — a rarity in this class. An optional sunroof is available.\n\nAll that space puts the rear window at a distance, however, and bulky C- and D-pillars also hurt visibility. Check out the photo thumbnails to see more.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe GMC Terrain badly needs a redesign for its center controls, whose jumbled shapes seem designed by Picasso. A 7-inch touch-screen is standard. For 2015 the Terrain gets 4G LTE service through OnStar with the ability to create a Wi-Fi hot spot for passengers to surf the web. Once the trial period (three months or 3 gigabytes) runs out, however, the subscription fees are steep. OnStar’s claimed advantage is better signal strength thanks to an antenna on top of the car, as opposed to your smartphone, but you’ll pay for it. Many smartphones can create their own hot spots that run off your data plan and service multiple devices, and my iPhone’s data plan charges less per extra gigabyte than OnStar.\n\nBluetooth phone and USB/iPod compatibility are also standard, but Bluetooth audio streaming requires GMC’s IntelliLink multimedia suite, which includes app support and voice recognition. IntelliLink comes on SLE-2 trims and higher.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe extra room in the GMC Terrain doesn’t spill into the cargo area, where bulky wheel wells limit the volume behind the rear seats to just 31.6 cubic feet. Many competitors have more than 35 cubic feet, and the gap persists when you compare maximum cargo room with the seats folded. The Terrain tops out at 63.9 cubic feet; the CR-V and RAV4 both exceed 70.\n\nSafety\nTop crash-test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety give the GMC Terrain a Top Safety Pick award for 2015. Click here to see all its safety features and here to see our Car Seat Check of the Terrain.\n\nA backup camera is standard. Options include lane departure, blind spot and forward collision cross-traffic warning systems. The collision warning system lacks automatic braking, however, which most systems now incorporate.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe GMC Terrain starts around $25,000, but a loaded Denali can run north of $43,000. That positions the GMC above the Equinox and most competitors, and some shoppers might even compare a Denali with entry-level luxury SUVs from Lexus, Acura, Volvo or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nWhatever you’re cross-shopping, the GMC Terrain’s comfort and refinement should compare well; likewise, the frustrations born of its bulkiness transcend the competition. Which side prevails? In Cars.com’s SUV comparison, the Equinox and Terrain placed second and third, respectively, out of seven SUVs despite being the oldest cars in the test by a long shot.\n\nOld strengths win out, it seems.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 GMC Terrain?\n\nThe GMC Terrain is a compact SUV that seats up to five. It runs on a standard 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission. A 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a nine-speed automatic is available. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. Competitors include the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 GMC Terrain?\n\nGMC Pro Safety is now standard and includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keep assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Denali versions gain front and rear parking sensors and unique suspension tuning. Meanwhile, the Black Edition has been renamed the Elevation Edition.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 GMC Terrain Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard fold-flat front passenger seat increases the Terrain’s cargo versatility, and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity lets you easily connect your phone to the multimedia system. Built-in 4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data trial included) mean portable devices can still be connected on-the-go.\n\n2020 GMC Terrain Vs. 2020 Honda CR-V: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe GMC Terrain and Honda CR-V have similar starting prices for base front-wheel-drive models, but between them the CR-V is more efficient: Its EPA rating is 30 mpg combined, while the Terrain is rated 27 mpg. Both small SUVs have firm suspension tuning, but the Terrain’s ride quality is more refined. With the Terrain’s addition of many new active safety features for 2020, the two SUVs are more similar in this area, though the CR-V has standard adaptive cruise control, which is optional on the Terrain.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 GMC Terrain?\n\nIf you’re looking for a refined, versatile compact SUV with an easy-to-use multimedia system, the Terrain is worth a look. Its additional standard active safety features enhance the GMC’s value in the crowded small SUV class.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2016 about the 2016 GMC Terrain, but little of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. The Terrain was redesigned for the 2018 model year, and you can read our First Drive here.\n\nIt’s also fallen behind the class with a multimedia setup that had me relying on my phone more than I should in a $40,000-plus SUV. And its safety options aren’t as advanced as others in the class.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Terrain is related to the Chevrolet Equinox, but where the Chevrolet has more curves and angles, the Terrain is much blockier. It’s a good, rugged look and helps the little SUV appear bigger than it really is. Because, while the Terrain is bigger than compact SUVs such as the Kia Sportage, Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester, the specs indicate it’s only a few inches larger here or there.\n\nFor 2016, some trims have a new grille with stacked frames, and GMC also redesigned the textured grille of Denali trims.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Terrain does not offer an exciting driving experience.  That in itself is fine — not every vehicle needs to be a sports car — but the Terrain’s performance really lags behind the rest of the class. It’s very slow away from the line and the steering is heavy. One trip around the block and it’s clear that it lags behind the RAV4, Forester and especially the peppy and redesigned 2017 Sportage.\n\nWe had the optional 301-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6, which makes 51 more horsepower than the next-most-powerful competitor (the Forester with its optional 250-hp four-cylinder), so the numbers indicate there’s more grunt under the hood than you feel. It suggests that the V-6 has been tuned in favor of mpg rather than power, and more than one editor suggested that a Sport mode would go a long way toward eliminating that perceived lack of power.\n\nOn the highway, you notice the V-6’s grunt in a good way. It’s able to cruise at higher speeds without the engine making as much noise as the competitors. It doesn’t seem to be working very hard when you’re cruising in the 65 mph range. The Forester, RAV4 and Sportage are unable to match the hushed experience of the Terrain, which also exhibits limited wind noise — a surprise, given the Terrain’s blockiness.\n\nOverall, the Terrain is a very comfortable car on the highway. In addition to the hushed cabin, the ride is among the best — easily superior to the Forester and RAV4 and more comfortable than the Sportage. Only the Honda CR-V, the winner of our 2015 Compact SUV Challenge, is able to match it for ride refinement. (The Terrain has since been updated in some respects, but I can say as a judge from that Challenge that the driving experience is unchanged.)\n\nBut when you get off the highway and go to park the Terrain, you’ll notice immediately that the turning circle is very wide. Depending on the wheel size, the specs indicate the Terrain needs anywhere from about 3 feet to almost 8 feet to complete the circle compared with the Sportage, RAV4 and Forester, but it feels like more. It’s noticeable in every parking situation that I came across, no matter if it was in a garage or in the open field of a forest preserve. It’s deal-breakingly bad for me.\n\nThe GMC Terrain Denali with the V-6 and all-wheel drive like we tested is rated an estimated 16/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined. The Terrain also is available as a V-6 with two-wheel drive (17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined) and with a four-cylinder engine. Four-cylinder models get 22/32/26 mpg with front-wheel drive and 20/29/23 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Denali trim level that we tested includes standard leather seats and leather-appointed door inserts as well as some wood-trim accents. The wood trim is subtle and suits the Terrain. The seats drew praise for their comfort not only from me, but also from other reviewers.\n\nInterior room is another area where the Terrain shines: Up front, the center console is large enough to be useful, but not so large that it cramps the occupants. But the real winner is the backseat. The seat both reclines and slides forward and back, but more importantly, there’s enough room to sit back there comfortably, even if you and the occupant sitting in front of you are tall. I’d go so far as to say the rear seats in the Terrain are the most comfortable in the class.\n\nAfter that, the Terrain starts to struggle…\n\nFor starters, those rear seats better be comfortable, because there are no amenities — such as climate controls or vents — for passengers, and the armrest cupholders are only decent.\n\nUp front, the materials on the door — especially the molded plastic of the lower door — didn’t quite measure up to the rest of the interior quality. Further, the chrome trim of the gearshift didn’t look or feel like metal and reflected an annoying glare on any sunny day. It felt like a tacked-on extra.\n\nThe same goes for the dashboard’s center control panel: It didn’t look integrated and, on the whole, there were so many buttons that it just didn’t look like a compact SUV aimed at luxury buyers — as a Denali model should.\n\nOutward visibility is pinched due to the wide A-pillars and rear pillars. Those rear windows, combined with the wide turning circle, only added to the parking challenges in the Terrain.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThis area rivals the Terrain’s turning circle for “Most Annoying” aspect. Simply put, the multimedia system and navigation trail the class both in usability and usefulness.\n\nFor starters, there’s both a touch-screen and a series of buttons on the dashboard to control many of the same functions. The buttons are somewhat easier to use because they’re grouped logically — climate controls together, audio controls together — but it’s still too hard to figure out which button to hit. And the display is sometimes too sensitive to the touch, yet can take too long to respond once the touch registers, particularly when inputting destinations into the navigation system. Furthermore, some editors pointed out that using the touch-screen itself wasn’t a joy, as it was far away from the driver’s seat and oddly angled in such a way that it was too easy to hit the rough surface of the hood that shields the display from sunlight.\n\nIt also takes too many steps to do something simple, such as switching from satellite radio to FM or an MP3 player and the like. GM has always mitigated this with a class-leading radio that lets you store presets regardless of FM/AM/XM band, but it hasn’t kept up with the times, as streaming music apps and phones-as-musical-storage-devices are easily as important today.\n\nFurther, the navigation system let me down on three occasions. First, it incorrectly located the entrance to a forest preserve (something my phone did correctly); second, it couldn’t accurately determine whether I was on the highway or frontage road; third, it gave directions that didn’t correlate with the layout of the highway I was on. (Had I taken the exit the navigation suggested, it would have involved crashing through a guardrail and falling 50 feet.) All in all, I found myself wanting to use my phone through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but these features are not offered in the Terrain, even though they’re proliferating throughout GM’s vehicles.\n\nOwing to the layout, the size of icons and the fact that the submenus do little to make things less complicated, the Terrain’s 7-inch screen seems smaller than it really is. A small screen doesn’t necessarily make for poor viewing, but in this case, the screen is just too distant and cluttered. Again I wanted to use my phone, not the system. It’s doubly interesting because GMC’s parent company GM — noticeably in its 2016 Chevrolet Malibu — has shown it knows how to make a multimedia system work effectively and be appealing. They just missed with the Terrain.\n\nFinally, on the highest trim level, not having keyless access and keyless start just doesn’t cut it in 2016, especially on a car that has a sticker price of more than $40,000.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Terrain has a very large, very useful cargo area. It’s not so high off the ground that I think shorter people will have difficulty, and it manages to be both wide and deep, which allowed me to pack a lot of stuff for my weekend camping trip. What’s interesting is that the specs indicate the Terrain cargo area isn’t the biggest of the RAV4/Forester/Sportage set, but this is a case where the specs don’t always tell the full story. I’ve always found the RAV4 to have a very good cargo area that can accommodate a wide variety of objects, but the Forester seems to be a touch narrower than the rest, and the Sportage is OK but not quite as useful as the Terrain and RAV4.\n\nCabin storage is good, with four cupholders up front; a deep, wide center console bin; and a nice-sized cubby underneath the multimedia system that I found myself using consistently through the course of my test.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 GMC Terrain received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good in its crash tests.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and our test model had the optional rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning and forward collision warning that kicks in at speeds greater than 25 mph. All worked well, in that they weren’t overly sensitive or so annoying that I wanted to turn them off. You can browse the safety features here.\n\nHowever, the Terrain does not offer forward automatic emergency braking or active lane departure prevention. In this way, it trails the Forester, RAV4 and Sportage as those cars offer at least forward automatic emergency braking. However, only the RAV4 also has active lane departure prevention.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe safety options are the best reflection of where the Terrain stands in the market: Others offer more, and what they offer is more advanced. When it made its debut, more than a few of us were impressed with the Terrain, but just as forward collision warning has been surpassed by forward collision prevention, so has been the Terrain by its rivals.\n\nThe Terrain still excels with its ride and interior room. If I had to schlep three big, tall adults from where we’re based in Chicago to, say, Omaha, the Terrain would be at the top of my list. And if you’re part of a family of big, tall people, you already know there’s no substitute for interior cubic feet. That space, its hushed cabin and smooth ride would be most welcome.\n\nHowever, that’s a pretty narrow range for a vehicle to perform in. Aside from the room and ride, the Terrain has been left behind in practically every other way. That we say this of a model that was updated for this model year is all the more damning.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2012 about the 2013 GMC Terrain Denali. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 GMC Terrain finally gets a proper V-6 engine option, but the new high-line Denali version doesn’t distinguish itself enough from the crossover’s other top trims.\n\nBoth the 301-horsepower V-6 engine and the Denali trim level are new to the Terrain for the 2013 model year. We experienced each in our all-wheel-drive test model, which had an as-tested price of $40,425 including an $825 destination charge. To compare the five-seat Terrain with competitors like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and Toyota RAV4, click here.\n\nPolarizing Design\nCompared with its sibling, the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Terrain’s exterior styling takes a lot more risks. It’s a dramatic departure from the Chevy, but not the prettiest one.\n\nA large trapezoidal grille defines the Terrain’s front end, and on Denali models the chrome grille has circular cutouts. The look is a little chrome-heavy.\n\nThe huge fender flares are a bit jarring, too. There’s something not quite right about the exaggerated, blocky shape surrounding a round wheel. Jeep has a similarly rugged fender treatment on its Liberty SUV, but that design seems to work better than the Terrain’s look.\n\nOverall, the Terrain’s mix of unusual design cues didn’t win many points from Cars.com staffers. It’s as if GMC was overly concerned the Terrain wouldn’t live up to the brand’s rugged, truck-centric image if it had more conservative styling.\n\nV-6 Performance\nThe Terrain’s newly available 3.6-liter V-6 engine is significantly stronger than the old 3.0-liter V-6, which never offered the level of power we’ve come to expect from modern six-cylinders.\n\nThe new V-6 is rated at 301 hp. With it, the Terrain moves out swiftly, accelerating strongly up to midrange speeds. Gradual gas pedal response means you need to press down more than in some cars, but the benefit is improved linearity across the pedal’s range and less sensitivity in its first inch of travel.\n\nIt accelerates easily to highway cruising speeds, too. Press the gas pedal partway down or fully to the floor and the six-speed automatic transmission responds readily with an appropriate downshift for more passing power. The automatic shifts smoothly … most of the time. It clunked a few times at parking-lot speeds, and there’s a persistent drivetrain whine when cruising at city speeds.\n\nOur appreciation of the V-6’s gusto is tempered somewhat by its EPA-estimated gas mileage, which at 16/23 mpg city/highway trails its V-6-powered all-wheel-drive competition: The Edge is rated 18/25 mpg with the 3.5-liter V-6, while the Murano and RAV4 get 18/23 and 19/26 mpg, respectively. Fuel-conscious shoppers should consider the Terrain’s base four-cylinder engine, which is rated as high as 22/32 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Terrain Denali feels hefty and substantial from the driver’s seat, more like a traditional SUV than a crossover. Suspension tuning is firm; it lets you feel bumps in the road, but it handles them in a refined way. The steering wheel turns with luxury-car smoothness, though feedback has been thoroughly suppressed.\n\nThe big surprise, though, is how well this crossover corners. Drive it hard into a tight turn and it stays flat and hunkered down in a way that encourages you to push it harder. Among midsize family crossovers, this kind of handling is especially rare, and it’s all the more surprising considering how the crossover feels in ordinary commuting — somewhat large and ponderous. The Denali version gets a unique suspension with dual-rate shock absorbers geared toward handling, GMC says.\n\nThe Terrain Denali settles in nicely on the highway, and that substantial, secure feeling is the kind of thing that can make a long day of driving less stressful. Road noise is constant but muted, and wind noise starts to build as you pass 65 mph.\n\nThe crossover’s large turning diameter, however, is a problem, and it revealed itself when maneuvering in a parking garage. With 19-inch wheels and tires, like our test car had, the Terrain’s turning diameter is 42.6 feet, 2.6 feet more than models with 17- or 18-inch wheels. Both the Edge and Murano are around 39 feet while the RAV4 tops out at about 37 feet.\n\nThe Inside\nDenali-specific details include a soft-touch dashboard with contrast stitching, black leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and embossed logos on the front seats, among other things, but the enhancements aren’t a dramatic leap from the regular Terrain’s higher trims. Some of the premium finishes, like red stitching on a soft-touch dashboard section, seem ill-conceived when the upper door trim remains hard plastic — not ideal for resting your arm.\n\nVisibility from the driver’s seat is good overall. The high seating position benefits forward views, and large side windows offer good over-shoulder visibility in spite of the high shoulder line.\n\nIt takes some studying to learn the layout of the center entertainment controls; it’s not the most intuitive, though it’s better than some GM designs. For a number of functions, like selecting a radio preset, you can press either the touch-screen or a hard key, which is a nice feature.\n\nWhen it comes to backseat space, the Terrain makes the most of its size, offering one of the roomiest second rows in the midsize-crossover segment. The rear bench slides forward and back as one piece, though the reclining backrest is split 60/40. With the seat all the way back, legroom is similar to what you’d get in a long-wheelbase full-size sedan. It’s very impressive.\n\nThe Terrain’s 31.6-cubic-foot cargo area is similar in size to the Edge’s and Murano’s, but the two-row RAV4 has about 36 cubic feet. The cargo floor in the GMC is a little high, and underneath it is the temporary spare tire. Fold the backseat and a flap on the floor helps prevent anything from falling into the gap created by the sliding backseat. There’s a maximum of 63.9 cubic feet of cargo volume with the rear seats folded.\n\nA power liftgate is available, and I like how it lets you choose the opening height of the hatch as well as turn off the power function. However, with the power off it takes a lot of effort to open and close the liftgate; it feels like you’re pushing against the liftgate motor.\n\nSafety\nThe Terrain received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation, and it was awarded four out of five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new cars as of the 2012 model year. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows and a backup camera. An optional Safety Package bundles forward collision warning, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Terrain, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nTerrain Denali in the Market\nThe Terrain has only been around for a few years, but it’s established itself as GMC’s second-best-selling model — through September 2012 only the Sierra full-size truck is ahead of it — proving that a car-like unibody crossover can have success with a traditional truck brand. The Terrain is a better crossover for 2013 with the new V-6 engine option, but the Denali upgrades are underwhelming.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 GMC Terrain finally gets a proper V-6 engine option, but the new high-line Denali version doesn’t distinguish itself enough from the crossover’s other top trims.\n\nBoth the 301-horsepower V-6 engine and the Denali trim level are new to the Terrain for the 2013 model year. We experienced each in our AWD test model, which had an as-tested price of $40,425 including an $825 destination charge. To compare the five-seat Terrain with competitors like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and Toyota RAV4, click here.\n\nPolarizing Design\nCompared with its sibling, the Chevrolet Equinox, the GMC Terrain’s exterior styling takes a lot more risks. It’s a dramatic departure from the Chevy, but not the prettiest one.\n\nA large trapezoidal grille defines the Terrain’s front end, and on Denali models the chrome grille has circular cutouts. The look is a little chrome-heavy.\n\nThe huge fender flares are a bit jarring, too. There’s something not quite right about the exaggerated, blocky shape surrounding a round wheel. Jeep has a similarly rugged fender treatment on its Liberty SUV, but that design seems to work better than the Terrain’s look.\n\nOverall, the GMC Terrain’s mix of unusual design cues didn’t win many points from Cars.com staffers. It’s as if GMC was overly concerned the Terrain wouldn’t live up to the brand’s rugged, truck-centric image if it had more conservative styling.\n\nV-6 Performance\nThe GMC Terrain’s newly available 3.6-liter V-6 engine is significantly stronger than the old 3.0-liter V-6, which never offered the level of power we’ve come to expect from modern six-cylinders.\n\nThe new V-6 is rated at 301 hp. With it, the Terrain moves out swiftly, accelerating strongly up to midrange speeds. Gradual gas pedal response means you need to press down more than in some cars, but the benefit is improved linearity across the pedal’s range and less sensitivity in its first inch of travel.\n\nIt accelerates easily to highway cruising speeds, too. Press the gas pedal partway down or fully to the floor and the six-speed automatic transmission responds readily with an appropriate downshift for more passing power. The automatic shifts smoothly … most of the time. It clunked a few times at parking-lot speeds, and there’s a persistent drivetrain whine when cruising at city speeds.\n\nOur appreciation of the V-6’s gusto is tempered somewhat by its EPA-estimated fuel economy, which at 16/23 mpg city/highway trails its V-6-powered AWD competition: The Edge is rated 18/25 mpg with the 3.5-liter V-6, while the Murano and RAV4 get 18/23 and 19/26 mpg, respectively. Fuel-conscious shoppers should consider the Terrain’s base four-cylinder engine, which is rated with fuel economy as high as 22/32 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Terrain Denali feels hefty and substantial from the driver’s seat, more like a traditional SUV than a crossover. Suspension tuning is firm; it lets you feel bumps in the road, but it handles them in a refined way. The steering wheel turns with luxury-car smoothness, though feedback has been thoroughly suppressed.\n\nThe big surprise, though, is how well this crossover corners. Drive it hard into a tight turn and it stays flat and hunkered down in a way that encourages you to push it harder. Among midsize family crossovers, this kind of handling is especially rare, and it’s all the more surprising considering how the crossover feels in ordinary commuting — somewhat large and ponderous. The Denali version gets a unique suspension with dual-rate shock absorbers geared toward handling, GMC says.\n\nThe Terrain Denali settles in nicely on the highway, and that substantial, secure feeling is the kind of thing that can make a long day of driving less stressful. Road noise is constant but muted, and wind noise starts to build as you pass 65 mph.\n\nThe crossover’s large turning diameter, however, is a problem, and it revealed itself when maneuvering in a parking garage. With 19-inch alloy wheels and tires, like our test vehicle had, the GMC Terrain’s turning diameter is 42.6 feet, 2.6 feet more than models with 17- or 18-inch wheels. Both the Edge and Murano are around 39 feet while the RAV4 tops out at about 37 feet.\n\nThe Inside\nDenali-specific details include a soft-touch dashboard with contrast stitching, black leather seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and embossed logos on the front seats, among other things, but the enhancements aren’t a dramatic leap from the regular Terrain’s higher trims. Some of the premium finishes, like red stitching on a soft-touch dashboard section, seem ill-conceived when the upper door trim remains hard plastic — not ideal for resting your arm.\n\nVisibility from the driver’s seat is good overall. The high seating position benefits forward views, and large side windows offer good over-shoulder visibility in spite of the high shoulder line.\n\nIt takes some studying to learn the layout of the center entertainment controls; it’s not the most intuitive, though it’s better than some GM designs. For a number of functions, like selecting a radio preset, you can press either the touch-screen or a hard key, which is a nice feature.\n\nWhen it comes to backseat space, the GMC Terrain makes the most of its size, offering one of the roomiest second rows in the midsize-crossover segment. The rear bench slides forward and back as one piece, though the reclining backrest is split 60/40. With the seat all the way back, legroom is similar to what you’d get in a long-wheelbase full-size sedan. It’s very impressive.\n\nThe Terrain’s 31.6-cubic-foot cargo area is similar in size to the Edge’s and Murano’s, but the two-row RAV4 has about 36 cubic feet. The cargo floor in the GMC is a little high, and underneath it is the temporary spare tire. Fold the backseat and a flap on the floor helps prevent anything from falling into the gap created by the sliding backseat. There’s a maximum of 63.9 cubic feet of cargo volume with the rear seats folded.\n\nA power liftgate is available, and I like how it lets you choose the opening height of the hatch as well as turn off the power function. However, with the power off it takes a lot of effort to open and close the liftgate; it feels like you’re pushing against the liftgate motor.\n\nSafety\nThe GMC Terrain received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation, and it was awarded four out of five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows and a backup camera. An optional Safety Package bundles forward collision warning, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Terrain, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nTerrain Denali in the Market\nThe Terrain has only been around for a few years, but it’s established itself as GMC’s second-best-selling model — through September 2012 only the Sierra full-size truck is ahead of it — proving that a car-like unibody crossover can have success with a traditional truck brand. The Terrain is a better crossover for 2013 with the new V-6 engine option, but the Denali upgrades are underwhelming.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Most vehicles get larger when redesigned, but the 2018 GMC Terrain is one of the rare ones that’s smaller than the SUV it replaces — at least externally. The Terrain and its sibling SUV, the Chevrolet Equinox, had long been two of the larger compact SUVs available, but the 2018 models are now closer in size to competitors like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. (See these four SUVs’ specs compared here.)\n\nThe new Terrain starts at $25,970, including a $975 destination charge, for a base, front-wheel-drive SL trim with the standard turbocharged gas 1.5-liter four-cylinder. I tested three versions of the SUV to experience its three available engines: an all-wheel-drive SLE with the 1.5-liter engine (as-tested price of $34,105), a front-wheel-drive SLT with the turbo-diesel 1.6-liter four-cylinder ($39,545 as-tested), and an all-wheel-drive SLT with the turbocharged gas 2.0-liter four-cylinder ($42,045 as-tested).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nPolarizing looks aren’t normally part of the compact SUV formula, but that’s what the prior GMC Terrain delivered with its bulging fenders, squared-off wheel openings and blocky front end. While the conservatively styled Equinox was designed to blend in, the Terrain stood out.\n\nWith its 2018 redesign, the Terrain trades many of its old controversial design cues for new styling elements that may be just as controversial — like boomerang-shaped headlights and floating-roof styling. Even so, the overall look is tamer and more traditional.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYou’ll find a wide range of performance in the compact SUV class, from the poky Jeep Compass to the powerful Ford Escape and its optional high-output turbocharged engine. The GMC Terrain’s three available engines each have distinct characteristics, but all of them deliver more than adequate power.\n\nI was especially impressed with the base turbo 1.5-liter engine, which is rated for a healthy 170 horsepower and 203 pounds-feet of torque. I wasn’t sure how the small engine would perform in an all-wheel-drive Terrain, but it felt reasonably quick and even had a bit of reserve power for passing slower-moving traffic.\n\nThe 1.5-liter engine drives a nine-speed automatic transmission that makes smooth, unobtrusive shifts and is willing to kick down to a lower gear when you need more power. The automatic does tend to stay in too high a gear when exiting corners, sapping available power, but it’s otherwise cooperative and didn’t exhibit any of the unpleasant behavior we’ve experienced with other nine-speed transmissions, like those in the Honda Pilot and Jeep Cherokee.\n\nThe optional turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder is considerably stronger, putting the Terrain’s performance on par with an Escape powered by its higher-output four-cylinder. With 252 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque, this engine gives the GMC Terrain the type of eager acceleration and high-speed passing power that’s relatively rare among mainstream compact SUVs. You’ll also hear more engine sounds in the cabin than with the 1.5-liter four-cylinder, but if you’re looking for extra power, get the 2.0-liter.\n\nIn a move that breaks with most of its competitors, the Terrain is also available with a turbo-diesel 1.6-liter four-cylinder that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission. Rated at 137 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque, the diesel is the fuel-economy leader of the trio, with an EPA-estimated 28/39/32 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive. That 32-mpg combined rating is 4 and 8 mpg better than the gas 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter engines, respectively, and matches the EPA estimate for the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, which is all-wheel drive only.\n\nWhether idling or accelerating, the diesel is notably louder than the gas engines, but the clattery sounds that have defined diesels for years have been largely eliminated, replaced with a gravelly growl. There’s also more vibration in the cabin — including through the steering wheel — and accelerator pedal response is more gradual.\n\nAside from its impressive fuel economy, abundant low-end torque is the diesel’s other key attribute. With four adults and some luggage aboard, a front-wheel-drive, turbo-diesel Terrain powered up hills without needing to downshift and accelerated to highway speeds easily.\n\nHigher maximum towing capacity is another typical diesel benefit, but the diesel Terrain’s is no better than the gas 1.5-liter; both engines are rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds, while the gas 2.0-liter can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nI like how GMC has tuned the suspension. Like a lot of small SUVs, the ride is on the firm side. You’ll feel it when crossing railroad tracks, but it’s also controlled and composed. The Terrain doesn’t feel as athletic as the Escape, and its steering doesn’t have much feedback, but it has good driving refinement — as does the redesigned 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, the winner of our 2017 Compact SUV Challenge. In this way, the GMC Terrain is better than the Nissan Rogue.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe new Terrain’s cabin is a big improvement over its predecessor, which was from an earlier era and no longer measured up to the competition. The new interior has a clean design, with upscale materials like soft-touch surfaces and aluminum trim.\n\nCloth upholstery is standard and leather is optional. I thought the driver’s seat was comfortable, but some might find the backrest a little narrow; you don’t need to move that much before you feel the side bolsters, but they didn’t grip me too tightly.\n\nThe previous GMC Terrain had a sliding and reclining backseat, but the redesigned model trades that for a fixed bench seat with a 60/40-split reclining backrest. The backseat is roomy for adults but not as spacious as the enormous rear seats in the 2018 Tiguan. The seat is mostly comfortable, but the upper portion of the backrest pressed oddly against my back. It was more pronounced in models with cloth seats.\n\nThe Terrain’s updated infotainment system has a standard 7-inch touchscreen and supports Bluetooth streaming audio as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. An optional 8-inch touchscreen incorporates cloud-based user profiles that can be recalled from another GM car that supports this technology. New graphics give the screen a cleaner appearance, and the system responds quickly to menu selections.\n\nI was skeptical of the GMC Terrain’s new gear selector, which employs both buttons and toggle switches, but it was easier to use by feel alone than competing push-button systems. The system’s horizontal layout is key; the arrangement lets you use your index and middle fingers to quickly switch between Reverse and Drive when making a three-point turn, for instance. It didn’t take long to get used to it. It also frees up a lot of space in the center console for a storage bin, side-by-side cupholders and additional controls.\n\nThe Terrain offers 29.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat and 63.3 cubic feet with the backseat folded. You can fold the split seatback yourself, or there are handles on the right-side cargo wall that release it. The backrest is spring-loaded so it folds by itself, creating an extended flat load floor. With the standard fold-flat front passenger seat also lowered, the GMC Terrain can carry cargo up to 8 feet long in the cabin.\n\nSafety\n\nNeither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had crash-tested the 2018 Terrain as of publication.\n\nNumerous active safety features are available starting on the SLE trim. The Driver Alert Package I includes blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates different areas of the cushion to alert the driver to potential hazards. The Driver Alert Package II adds forward collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and lane departure warning.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nGMC has built itself into something of a near-luxury brand in recent years — especially with the popularity of its high-end Denali-specific lineup, which the brand says accounts for nearly 30 percent of all sales. Even though higher-end trim levels can get pricey, the Terrain’s starting price isn’t significantly higher than many mainstream compact SUVs, and its base price undercuts near-luxury competitors like the Acura RDX, Buick Envision and Lincoln MKC by significant margins. How much value the GMC Terrain brings will depend on which competitor you’re considering, but no matter which group you stack it up against, the Terrain has the refinement, versatility and features to hold its own.",

      "expert_review": "Most vehicles get larger when redesigned, but the 2018 GMC Terrain is one of the rare ones that’s smaller than the SUV it replaces — at least externally. The Terrain and its sibling SUV, the Chevrolet Equinox, had long been two of the larger compact SUVs available, but the 2018 models are now closer in size to competitors like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. (See these four SUVs’ specs compared here.)\n\nThe new Terrain starts at $25,970, including a $975 destination charge, for a base, front-wheel-drive SL trim with the standard turbocharged gas 1.5-liter four-cylinder. I tested three versions of the SUV to experience its three available engines: an all-wheel-drive SLE with the 1.5-liter engine (as-tested price of $34,105), a front-wheel-drive SLT with the turbo-diesel 1.6-liter four-cylinder ($39,545 as-tested), and an all-wheel-drive SLT with the turbocharged gas 2.0-liter four-cylinder ($42,045 as-tested).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nPolarizing looks aren’t normally part of the compact SUV formula, but that’s what the prior GMC Terrain delivered with its bulging fenders, squared-off wheel openings and blocky front end. While the conservatively styled Equinox was designed to blend in, the Terrain stood out.\n\nWith its 2018 redesign, the Terrain trades many of its old controversial design cues for new styling elements that may be just as controversial — like boomerang-shaped headlights and floating-roof styling. Even so, the overall look is tamer and more traditional.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nYou’ll find a wide range of performance in the compact SUV class, from the poky Jeep Compass to the powerful Ford Escape and its optional high-output turbocharged engine. The GMC Terrain’s three available engines each have distinct characteristics, but all of them deliver more than adequate power.\n\nI was especially impressed with the base turbo 1.5-liter engine, which is rated for a healthy 170 horsepower and 203 pounds-feet of torque. I wasn’t sure how the small engine would perform in an all-wheel-drive Terrain, but it felt reasonably quick and even had a bit of reserve power for passing slower-moving traffic.\n\nThe 1.5-liter engine drives a nine-speed automatic transmission that makes smooth, unobtrusive shifts and is willing to kick down to a lower gear when you need more power. The automatic does tend to stay in too high a gear when exiting corners, sapping available power, but it’s otherwise cooperative and didn’t exhibit any of the unpleasant behavior we’ve experienced with other nine-speed transmissions, like those in the Honda Pilot and Jeep Cherokee.\n\nThe optional turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder is considerably stronger, putting the Terrain’s performance on par with an Escape powered by its higher-output four-cylinder. With 252 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque, this engine gives the GMC Terrain the type of eager acceleration and high-speed passing power that’s relatively rare among mainstream compact SUVs. You’ll also hear more engine sounds in the cabin than with the 1.5-liter four-cylinder, but if you’re looking for extra power, get the 2.0-liter.\n\nIn a move that breaks with most of its competitors, the Terrain is also available with a turbo-diesel 1.6-liter four-cylinder that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission. Rated at 137 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque, the diesel is the fuel-economy leader of the trio, with an EPA-estimated 28/39/32 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive. That 32-mpg combined rating is 4 and 8 mpg better than the gas 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter engines, respectively, and matches the EPA estimate for the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, which is all-wheel drive only.\n\nWhether idling or accelerating, the diesel is notably louder than the gas engines, but the clattery sounds that have defined diesels for years have been largely eliminated, replaced with a gravelly growl. There’s also more vibration in the cabin — including through the steering wheel — and accelerator pedal response is more gradual.\n\nAside from its impressive fuel economy, abundant low-end torque is the diesel’s other key attribute. With four adults and some luggage aboard, a front-wheel-drive, turbo-diesel Terrain powered up hills without needing to downshift and accelerated to highway speeds easily.\n\nHigher maximum towing capacity is another typical diesel benefit, but the diesel Terrain’s is no better than the gas 1.5-liter; both engines are rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds, while the gas 2.0-liter can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nI like how GMC has tuned the suspension. Like a lot of small SUVs, the ride is on the firm side. You’ll feel it when crossing railroad tracks, but it’s also controlled and composed. The Terrain doesn’t feel as athletic as the Escape, and its steering doesn’t have much feedback, but it has good driving refinement — as does the redesigned 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, the winner of our 2017 Compact SUV Challenge. In this way, the GMC Terrain is better than the Nissan Rogue.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe new Terrain’s cabin is a big improvement over its predecessor, which was from an earlier era and no longer measured up to the competition. The new interior has a clean design, with upscale materials like soft-touch surfaces and aluminum trim.\n\nCloth upholstery is standard and leather is optional. I thought the driver’s seat was comfortable, but some might find the backrest a little narrow; you don’t need to move that much before you feel the side bolsters, but they didn’t grip me too tightly.\n\nThe previous GMC Terrain had a sliding and reclining backseat, but the redesigned model trades that for a fixed bench seat with a 60/40-split reclining backrest. The backseat is roomy for adults but not as spacious as the enormous rear seats in the 2018 Tiguan. The seat is mostly comfortable, but the upper portion of the backrest pressed oddly against my back. It was more pronounced in models with cloth seats.\n\nThe Terrain’s updated infotainment system has a standard 7-inch touchscreen and supports Bluetooth streaming audio as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. An optional 8-inch touchscreen incorporates cloud-based user profiles that can be recalled from another GM car that supports this technology. New graphics give the screen a cleaner appearance, and the system responds quickly to menu selections.\n\nI was skeptical of the GMC Terrain’s new gear selector, which employs both buttons and toggle switches, but it was easier to use by feel alone than competing push-button systems. The system’s horizontal layout is key; the arrangement lets you use your index and middle fingers to quickly switch between Reverse and Drive when making a three-point turn, for instance. It didn’t take long to get used to it. It also frees up a lot of space in the center console for a storage bin, side-by-side cupholders and additional controls.\n\nThe Terrain offers 29.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat and 63.3 cubic feet with the backseat folded. You can fold the split seatback yourself, or there are handles on the right-side cargo wall that release it. The backrest is spring-loaded so it folds by itself, creating an extended flat load floor. With the standard fold-flat front passenger seat also lowered, the GMC Terrain can carry cargo up to 8 feet long in the cabin.\n\nSafety\n\nNeither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had crash-tested the 2018 Terrain as of publication.\n\nNumerous active safety features are available starting on the SLE trim. The Driver Alert Package I includes blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates different areas of the cushion to alert the driver to potential hazards. The Driver Alert Package II adds forward collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and lane departure warning.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nGMC has built itself into something of a near-luxury brand in recent years — especially with the popularity of its high-end Denali-specific lineup, which the brand says accounts for nearly 30 percent of all sales. Even though higher-end trim levels can get pricey, the Terrain’s starting price isn’t significantly higher than many mainstream compact SUVs, and its base price undercuts near-luxury competitors like the Acura RDX, Buick Envision and Lincoln MKC by significant margins. How much value the GMC Terrain brings will depend on which competitor you’re considering, but no matter which group you stack it up against, the Terrain has the refinement, versatility and features to hold its own.",
