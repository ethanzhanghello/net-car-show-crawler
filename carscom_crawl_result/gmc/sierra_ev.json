      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Silverado EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Hummer EV Pickup, Rivian R1T\n\nLooks like: A GMC-badged Silverado EV, much like the gas-only Sierra and Silverado lookalike\n\nPowertrains: Dual electric motors and battery pack making up to 754 horsepower (Max Power mode); all-wheel drive; estimated 400 miles maximum range\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2024, with AT4 and Elevation to follow as model-year 2025 offerings\n\nGiven how intertwined internal-combustion-engined GMC and Chevrolet pickup trucks are, it should come as no surprise that, following the January debut of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC will add a Sierra EV to its lineup for 2024. The luxe 2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 will be the first model available at launch, with the off-road AT4 and mainstream Elevation to follow as 2025 models.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST First Edition\n\nGMC, like Chevrolet, is keeping a lot of details about the Sierra EV close to its vest. We don’t yet have figures like mpg-equivalent estimates, capacity (or capacities) of its Ultium battery or a curb weight. What we do know, however, suggests the Sierra EV, like its internal-combustion counterpart, will be very similar to the Silverado EV.\n\nMax Power With a Dose of Carcinization\n\nThe Sierra EV is expected to have a maximum range of 400 miles, according to GMC, though it seems unlikely owners will get that far if they use Max Power mode. That unlocks the Sierra’s maximum power ratings of 754 horsepower and 785 pounds-feet of torque, which the brand estimates will propel the big truck from 0-60 mph in less than 4.5 seconds. (GMC hasn’t yet provided horsepower or torque figures for other trims or when not using Max Power mode.)\n\nOther neat features on this futuristic electric pickup include an adaptable air suspension with 2 inches of height adjustment, GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system available even when towing (up to the Sierra EV’s 9,500-pound towing capacity), adjustable regenerative braking and one-pedal driving.\n\nAnd like the theory of carcinization — where a crustacean will eventually evolve into a crablike form — the Sierra EV moves toward that crabby reality by adding four-wheel steering with GMC’s CrabWalk feature. The technology first debuted on the GMC Hummer EV pickup and allows the vehicle to move diagonally at low speeds to improve maneuverability.\n\nGMC’s charging estimates aren’t fully fleshed out, either, but the brand says the Sierra EV can add roughly 100 miles of range in 10 minutes at a maximum 350-kilowatts of DC fast charging on an 800-volt charger. The electric pickup can also send up to 10.2 kW of juice out of the battery and into a variety of plugged-in devices via the Power Station Pro feature.\n\nFamiliar Looks and Functionality\n\nThe Sierra EV will look very familiar to those who’ve seen the Silverado EV, with a very “modern Avalanche” body style and, on the Denali Edition 1, gigantic 24-inch wheels. There’s a front trunk with two drain plugs and a power-lifting hood for easier access, and like the Silverado EV, the Sierra EV has an adjustable-length bed with an extension into the cabin. The cargo box is just under 6 feet long, extending to just over 9 feet with the midgate lowered to give access to the interior. With the midgate lowered and the MultiPro Tailgate lowered into its load stop position, the bed extends to a maximum of just 10 feet, 10 inches.\n\nLuxe Denali Interior\n\nWhile luxury includes a lot of tech, GMC isn’t skimping on the materials inside the Denali Edition 1, with quilted seats and open-pore wood trim. A panoramic glass roof aims to make the cabin feel more open, and GMC says it has a UV coating and is infrared reflective, which should keep occupants from baking in the cabin.\n\nOn the tech front, the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 gets a 16.8-inch touchscreen display with the Google Built-In system, a configurable 11-inch digital instrument panel and 14-inch color head-up display. GMC also says the Sierra EV will have up to 14 available camera views.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nGMC hasn’t shared full pricing information yet, but the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 will have a starting price north of $107,000 before destination or any tax credits are applied. Reservations for the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 are open now, with GMC anticipating deliveries to begin in early 2024. The Elevation and off-road AT4 trims are expected to follow as 2025 models.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV: The Avalanche Resurrected (and Electrified)\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Pickup: 7 Things We Like and 3 We Don’t\n2023 GMC Hummer EV Pickup Review: Awesome in Nearly Every Way\n2024 GMC Sierra HD Up Close: Fixing What Needed Fixing\n2024 GMC Sierra HD: New Tech, New Interior, Same Mission\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With 460 miles of range, 760 horsepower and 785 pounds-feet of torque, the maxed-out 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali is one of the most numerically impressive electric trucks on the market. It doesn’t hurt that it’s one of the most luxurious, too. \n\nVersus the competition: CrabWalk, big range, bigger power and a lofty towing capacity put the Sierra EV well in the same league as the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck, but in Denali trim, it’s also heavier and more expensive. \n\nIf you’re reading this review to make your decision between this 2025 GMC Sierra EV and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, don’t bother. These trucks, in equivalent trims, are mechanically and functionally identical — same range, same power, same torque, same neato midgate and same multiposition tailgate.\n\nSurprised? You shouldn’t be; with a few exceptions, this is the playbook followed by the gas-powered GMC Sierra 1500 and Chevy Silverado 1500 for a few decades now. Deciding between these electric trucks comes entirely down to which wrapper fits your style best, with distinct exterior designs and subtle differences in interior presentation and tech.\n\nRelated: 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV First Edition RST Review: All the Bells, All the Whistles\n\n2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nSo, we’ll start there. The 2024 Silverado EV First Edition RST we reviewed in May started at $96,495 (including destination) and was nicely equipped, but its presentation and interior styling might lean a bit too strongly on the “sport truck” aesthetic for some buyers. Look to the Sierra EV’s $100,495 Denali range-topping trim for maturity; where the RST peppers red and blue accents throughout the cabin, the Denali is dichromatic, oscillating between black, silver and gray, with heavy and surprisingly proud use of gloss-black plastic.\n\nI’m not the biggest fan of the latter, but its open-pore wood is a welcome addition. For those accustomed to the finery of GMC’s gas-powered Denalis elsewhere in its lineup, you’ll feel right at home in this Cowboy Cadillac, which offers every manner of cossetting comfort feature short of massage seats. Metal trim is a nice touch, especially with the subtle ghost inscription of Mount Denali’s coordinates on the front passenger-side dash trim.\n\nTech Trek\n\nThe biggest difference between the Denali and the RST is the former’s towering 16.8-inch vertically oriented infotainment touchscreen. Compare this to the Silverado EV RST’s sprawling 17.7-inch horizontal infotainment display and make your decision; both trucks handle driver instrumentation via an 11-inch digital cluster and 14-inch head-up display.\n\nGoogle Built-In technology takes the place of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it works well enough that I wasn’t too annoyed at the lack of phone projection. GMC’s digital architecture is crisp, aesthetically dark, and reactive enough to never frustrate or stutter. As is the case on many high-end GM sleds, most vehicle controls are handled on the display with areas of customizable “pins” to dock your favorite or frequent functions.\n\n2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nCushion for Pushin’\n\nIt’s a luxe place to spend your time truckin’, that’s for sure. Backseat passengers are similarly swaddled, though the trim appointments aren’t quite as bountiful as those up front. This is a big-ass truck, if you’ll pardon the phrase, so head-, shoulder and legroom are never an issue in any seat.\n\nIt drives silky, too. The Denali rides on a standard air suspension and is backed by excellent brake blend (the balance between the physical brakes and regenerative braking system) that makes maneuvering free of the traditional EV touchiness. It also has rear-wheel steering, which makes the truck’s hulking dimensions merely a state of existence, not a hindrance.\n\nIt’s all very smooth and refined, though we curiously didn’t find the same cushy charisma in the Silverado EV when we tested the Chevy. I’ll say this: Like airplane turbulence and music volume, what’s extreme to one person is “fine” or normal to another. Suspension character is the same, and the location of each truck test may have also played a role — our intrepid editor Damon Bell drove the Silverado EV on Detroit’s craggy streets while I took the Sierra on damp, smooth tarmac twisting through California’s greater Bay Area.\n\nWe are both in agreement regarding the handling of these uber-trucks. The GMC is far, far more capable on a backroad than it needs to be, carrying itself more like a large crossover than a nearly 9,000-pound behemoth. That’s right: It weighs well more than 4 tons. It might sound cliche, but it doesn’t necessarily feel or move like it, though it certainly doesn’t feel nearly as light as a standard gas-powered full-size truck.\n\n2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali: No Longer Edition 1, Still Fully Loaded\nOwners of GM Electric Vehicles Can Now Use Tesla Superchargers\nWhat’s Bidirectional Charging and Which EVs Offer It?\n2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV on the Drag Strip: WTF Was That?\nShop for a New GMC Sierra EV\nAll Power, All Ways\n\nWith 760 horsepower and 785 pounds-feet of torque, the Sierra EV Denali doesn’t loaf around like one, either. GMC claims the dual-motor Denali cracks off 0-60 mph in less than 4.5 seconds, quickly imparting enough momentum to treat concrete retaining walls like paper mache. But keep your foot out of it! This is an electric vehicle, remember? Do you want to zap that battery dry?\n\nOr maybe don’t. The Sierra’s Max Range battery is good for a whopping 460 miles of range when brimmed, while a lower-spec Extended Range configuration cuts range to a still-impressive 390 miles. The Sierra EV can DC fast-charge at up to 350 kilowatts for a quicker public-charging experience (provided you can find one that delivers that level of power).\n\nOn the subject of charging, the Sierra EV’s (and Silverado EV’s, by extension) steering-wheel-mounted regen-on-demand paddle is fantastic. GM’s had a regenerative-braking paddle for a while now, but it’s long been a binary on-off toggle that was more fun to try than it was useful. It now offers varying levels of resistance depending on your hand’s input. Talk about a “hand brake.” This is a lovely accoutrement to the truck’s one-pedal drive mode.\n\nA Real Truck?\n\nIt drives smooth, accelerates like a boulder off a cliff, lavishes you in leather and has enough digital real estate to service a baseball stadium’s jumbotron needs. We’ll have to get one for additional testing to see how it is at truck-specific things, but at first brush, the 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali follows the same two-track trail as its gas cousins: more than a Chevy, less than a Cadillac, making it just right — if you can stand the mammoth $100,000 buy-in.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "GMC’s electrification efforts come into full swing with the 2026 Sierra EV. Introduced as a 2024 model and only available in fully loaded Denali spec for the 2025 model year, the Sierra EV family fills out for 2026 with the entry-level Elevation trim and off-road AT4 variants. As with the Chevrolet Silverado EV, a smaller battery pack is now also available, bringing the number of choices to three: Standard Range, Extended Range and Max Range. Between the lower-content trim level and smaller battery pack, GMC lops $27,500 from the Sierra EV’s base price.\n\nRelated: What Are the Pros and Cons of the 2025 GMC Sierra EV?\n\nHow Much Does the 2026 Sierra EV Cost?\n\nThe 2026 GMC Sierra EV will start at $64,495 (all prices include $2,095 destination charge) and will go on sale in the summer. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nElevation (Standard Range): $64,495\nElevation (Extended Range): $72,695\nAT4 (Extended Range): $81,395\nAT4 (Max Range): $91,695\nDenali (Standard Range): $71,795\nDenali (Extended Range): $79,995\nDenali (Max Range): $100,695\nWhat Are the 2026 Sierra EV’s Trim Levels?\n\nSo far, GMC has released scant details on the 2026 Sierra EV’s new trim levels. However, we do know that the base Elevation will ride on 18-inch wheels and feature GMC’s MultiPro Tailgate, which can be opened in various ways to accommodate loads of different sizes or act as a step to help people climb into the bed. A power-operated frunk is also standard, and an available Premium Package includes GM’s MultiPro Midgate (a foldable rear cab wall), a spray-in bedliner, ventilated seats and a Bose sound system. GM’s Super Cruise hands-free semi-autonomous highway-driving tech is optional on the Elevation but standard on the other new-for-2026 trim, the AT4.\n\nThe off-road-oriented AT4 trim gets a 2-inch suspension lift and 35-inch all-terrain tires mounted to 18-inch rims. Rear-wheel steering is also standard to aid in maneuverability, as are red front recovery hooks, a front skid plate, illuminated red GMC badge on the truck’s nose, unique interior trim and head-up display. The same Premium Package offered on the Elevation is optional on the AT4. With the Max Range battery, the package also includes a fixed panoramic glass roof and uprated bidirectional charging capability, but those options are an additional upcharge with the Extended Range pack.\n\nThe Denali gets 22-inch wheels and standard Super Cruise, as well as premium interior materials and walk-up grille illumination. The Denali’s Premium Package adds the Extended Range battery, MultiPro Midgate, a fixed panoramic glass roof and bidirectional charging. A Reserve Package builds on the Premium Package’s content; it’s optional with the Extended Range pack and standard with the Max. It includes all of the equipment from the 2025 Sierra EV, including a height-adjustable adaptive air suspension (old-fashioned coil springs are standard), four-wheel steering, CrabWalk capability and 24-inch wheels.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Sierra EV’s Powertrain Specs and Range?\n\nEvery Sierra EV has two electric motors, one on each axle, for standard four-wheel drive. Total output depends on the trim level and battery pack. The Sierra EV Elevation is available with the Standard and Extended Range battery packs; AT4 buyers can choose between the Extended and Max Range packs; and all three packs are available on the Denali. GMC has yet to release specifications for the Standard Range battery pack.\n\nWith the Extended Range battery, however, total output is as follows:\n\nElevation: 645 horsepower, 765 pounds-feet of torque\nAT4: 625 hp, 775 pounds-feet\nDenali: 645 hp, 785 pounds-feet\n\nWith the Max Range pack, total output is as follows:\n\nAT4: 725 hp, 775 pounds-feet of torque\nDenali: 760 hp, 785 pounds-feet\n\nGMC has also not disclosed the storage capacity of its batteries, nor official range estimates. For the 2025 Sierra EV, the Extended Range battery was good for an EPA-rated 390 miles, and GMC claimed the Max could travel 460 miles between charges. With its available 800-volt architecture capable of DC fast charging at up to 350 kilowatts, GMC says the Sierra EV can add 100 miles of range in as little as 10 minutes.\n\nHow Much Can the 2026 Sierra EV Tow?\n\nDrivers certainly won’t be covering those distances with a heavy load aboard or hitched behind the Sierra EV, but the electric pickup truck’s credentials are impressive. The Elevation and Denali can tow up to 12,500 pounds, while the AT4 has a towing capacity of 12,300 pounds. There’s a similarly slight difference in payload capacity: The Elevation and Denali are rated for payloads weighing up to 2,250 pounds, while the AT4 can handle 1,950 pounds in its bed.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated March 27, 2025, after GMC corrected the wheel size of the AT4.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali Review: Chargeable Cowboy Caddy\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nResearch the GMC Sierra EV\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
