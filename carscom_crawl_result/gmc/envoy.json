      "expert_review": "Don’t call it Jimmy. Not even Jim or James.\n\nSimply call the newest member of the GMC family, the Envoy.\n\nEnvoy is built on the same platform as the Jimmy sport-utility vehicle, a direct descendant of the compact Chevrolet Blazer. Envoy shares the same engine, transmission, brakes, carpeting, steering wheel, windshield . . . you get the picture.\n\nBut Envoy is designer jeans, Jimmy is coveralls. Envoy is workout, Jimmy is workhorse.\n\n“The Jimmy name has too much `aw, shucks’ country flavor. Envoy is a diplomat and more of an international name,” said Jeff Cohen, brand manager of Jimmy/Envoy compact sport-utes for Pontiac/ GMC.\n\nSimply stated, GMC is committed to being the luxury-truck division for General Motors Corp. and Envoy is more in keeping with that image than Jimmy. Envoy represents “the strength and capabilities of a truck without the truck ride and handling,” Cohen says. It is lush and plush. No shoes, no shirt, no Envoy, thank you.\n\nThe compact Envoy, along with the full-size Yukon Denali (Cartalk, April 26), was designed to give GM some class sport-utes to attract luxury buyers because the Cadillac division had chosen to stick with sedans and leave the sport-utes to others.\n\nHowever, before Envoy and Denali hit showrooms, Cadillac had a change of heart –prompted by bean counters who read reports of Ford earning $5,000 and more on the sale of each luxury Lincoln Navigator– and said it would unveil a dolled up Cadillac version of the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon named Escalade this fall as a ’99.\n\nSo with Denali/Envoy/Escalade, GM will have a trio of luxury sport-utes. Could have been worse: could have had none. GMC might still end up as the only division with a luxury sport-utility if Cadillac drops Escalade when its new hybrid sport-ute that’s half car-half SUV comes out in roughly the 2000-2001 time frame.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nIf the Jimmy name stays, Cohen said, it probably would be on a two-door limited-edition price leader.\n\nEnvoy is a spruced-up vehicle that proves you not only can take the boy out of the country, but you can take the country out of the boy if you give him leather seats, an upgraded sound system, a power sunroof and several pounds of decorative plastic rocker panels and wheel lip covers.\n\nEnvoy is aimed at the 35- to 49-year-old with household income of $100,000, whereas Jimmy is aimed at the 30- to 44-year-old with a $55,000 to $70,000 household income.\n\nCohen wouldn’t say how many Envoys will be built other than, “we won’t flood or starve dealers with them.” But GMC hopes to sell 70,000 to 80,000 Jimmys a year and a good guesstimate would be 25,000 Envoys.\n\nEnvoy, like Jimmy, is offered with a 4.3-liter, V-6 engine, no V-8, though most luxury SUVs boast V-8 power for added towing. To get a V-8 in the Jimmy/Blazer engine compartment, however, would be asking a lot–of the e ngine compartment. Besides, the industry doesn’t need another V-8-powered SUV that consumes fuel faster than the Arabs can put it on the boat and ship it here.\n\n“We studied having a V-8, but it didn’t make sense for the amount of the investment,” Cohen said.\n\nThank you.\n\nA couple of minutes behind the wheel and you realize this isn’t a Jimmy. The suspension with its revalved shocks transmits little harshness back into the cabin. Load leveling keeps you on an even keel for optimum handling. But after 70 miles behind the wheel, the back feels a tad weary because the seat backs are a bit stiff. The leather-covered cushions could use an added shot of foam.\n\nWe’ve driven Envoy here and through the mountains of Arizona and found the 4.3-liter V-6 has ample potency on the Illinois flatlands but could use a bit more beef to go with its beauty in the desert or on–any–hills. There’s a telltale engine growl at off-the-line starts that’s not in keeping with the luxury image.\n\nEnvoy comes as a complete package. Only options are a sunroof for $750 (every SUV should have one, though maybe GMC and the consumer would save some money without the one-touch express-open feature and simply have you press the button until the glass is open as far as you want) and GM’s OnStar emergency communications/safety system for about $1,000 (dealer installed so prices will vary), which links motorists to mechanical or medical help via a phone call and pinpoints your location via satellite so help can find you.\n\nHow complete is an Envoy? There’s electronic four-wheel-drive. Just push the button, and it engages. And there’s the luxury-ride whisper-smooth, whisper-quiet suspension to cushion your tush. Plus an automatic load-leveling suspension adjusts on its own to keep you flat for optimum handling though a boat or barge is strapped to the rear bumper.\n\nOther goodies include cast-aluminum wheels; a spare tire hidden under the body so no one has to look at a 40-pound blob of steel-belted Latex hanging onto the hatch; high-intensity discharge headlamps, penetrating silver blue lights so powerful they seem to prolong sunset by about 12 hours and sometimes prompt oncoming motorists to give you the “You’re No. 1” salute; daytime running lamps so you are not without light even in the day; foglamps so you are not without light even in the fog; automatic on/off headlamps and neon center-mounted rear stop lamp so you are never without light moving or standing still; four-wheel anti-lock brakes and dual depowered air bags in case the lights don’t work; keyless entry with panic alarm; rear compartment compressed-air port with hose to inflate a flat or blow up a beach ball to play with when taking a break from trying to figure out how to turn out the lights; power brakes/steering/locks/windows/heated mirrors; Bose AM-FM stereo with cassette, six speakers and CD player; electronic climate control; and leather seats.\n\nThere are two items that the larger Denali has that the smaller Envoy doesn’t. The Envoy sports only 15-inch tires, not 16-inch treads for better road grip, and there’s no reversible floor mat in the rear cargo hold with cloth on one side, rubber on the other that you can flip when having to carry wet items such as swimsuits.\n\n“I’d like to have had the mats and the 16-inch tires, but I would have had to wait until 1999 to get Envoy, and I didn’t want to wait another 12 months,” Cohen said.\n\nAnd the Envoy’s 4WD system isn’t as sophisticated as Denali’s. Denali will engage 4WD on its own when it detects wheel slippage. Envoy’s requires you push a button to engage it. It looks like Envoy will get the Denali system but not for at least another year.\n\nSome nice touches include a hole in the rear bumper to insert the jack handle and release the spare; rear side windows that power down all the way; hatch-release button in the instru ment panel; large easy-to-see-and-use controls as well as digital clock, compass and outside temp readings in the roof console; rear cargo net to hold luggage and groceries in place with plans to soon offer a plastic cargo tray for wet items; and cargo shade to hide stowed items; both cup and juice-box holders in the rear side doors; cupholders in the front doors; headphones and separate radio controls for rear-seat passengers; a power plug in the back of the center console to serve rear-seat passengers; fold away side mirrors; heated seats; roof rack; tinted glass; integrated front-end tow hooks; plastic bumper/fender/rocker panel extensions that not only look good but also protect the metal body from dents and dings; and an integrated step in the rear bumper with class II (5,000-pound) towing hitch.\n\nBut the neatest feature is that, when you fold the rear seats to increase cargo room, the headrests automatically fold so you don’t have to remove them.\n\nHow ever, a few gripes include stiff seat backs front and rear (perforated leather might make the seats softer), a shortage of legroom in back that makes long-distance travel tiring and no stowage compartment under the front passenger seat to store Mom’s purse out of view because the glove box isn’t big enough for it.\n\n>> 1998 GMC Envoy 4WD\nWheelbase: 107 inches Length: 183.8 inches Engine: 4.3-liter, 190-h.p.

      "expert_review": "Luxury sport-utility vehicles figure to be one of the major automotive stories of the 1999 model year.\n\nIn terms of sales, luxury SUVs are beyond hot. Most brands of upscale sport-utilities are selling as fast as manufacturers can build them.\n\nFor not much more than the cost of a sporty midsize luxury sedan, you can buy this week’s GMC Envoy, a leather- and wood-clad all-terrain vehicle that is no poseur. It’s as capable on the road as it is off.\n\nThe Envoy has many good points — it offers respectable quality and adequate performance. But in terms of styling and prestige, it may come up a bit short compared with some other vehicles in its price range, namely the Mercedes-Benz ML320 and the Lexus RX300.\n\nPerformance, handling\n\nThe Envoy comes with a powerful 4.3-liter, pushrod V-6 that makes 190 horsepower. The only transmission available is a four-speed automatic. An electronically controlled, four-wheel drive system is standard on the Envoy.\n\nGeneral Motors makes great engines, and this is one of best. With the 4.3-liter, you get V-8 performance with V-6 economy. Though I didn’t spend much time churning through swamps and fording rivers, I did learn that the Envoy performs well on dirt roads and over bad terrain, such as bumpy hills.\n\nThere is plenty of power, so pulling a boat or a trailer won’t present any problems. GMC says the Envoy can haul a 5,000-pound load. The four-speed automatic has GM’s new standard tow/haul button on the shifter. The system adjusts the timing of the shifts based on the load the vehicle is pulling. The button needs a stronger spring. Just rubbing your thumb across it changes the setting.\n\nIt’s easy to shift from two-wheel drive to four. All you do is press a button on the dash. The transition is nearly seamless. Also, the Envoy’s performance isn’t affected much when all four wheels are getting power.\n\nThe Envoy is aimed at the luxury crowd, so GMC engineers softened up its suspension; I’m not sure this is a good thing. The ride seemed too vague and cushy at times, such as when you ride over a quick succession of small bumps and head quickly into a turn.\n\nWhat’s really needed is a total rebuild of this vehicle with a state-of-the-art, four-wheel independent suspension system. GM has a new Envoy on the way, but details of its underpinnings are being k ept under wraps.\n\nSteering and brakes are excellent. The Envoy turns a complete circle in 39.5 feet — not bad for a four-wheel drive, off-road vehicle. Several times I maneuvered the Envoy into tight shopping center parking spaces. The brake system consists of four-wheel, anti-lock discs.\n\nFit and finish\n\nSoft, silver leather upholstery and shiny Zebrano wood trim lend class to the Envoy’s functional interior. The wood and leather, by the way, are the same materials used in various Cadillacs.\n\nI view the Envoy as the little brother to the mighty GMC Denali — GM’s best luxury sport-utility vehicle.\n\nAs with the Denali, the Envoy has a long list of luxury creature features and safety items.\n\nYou appreciate such things as automatic head lights, outside mirrors that fold in with the press of a button, and the rear window, which opens independently from the tailgate.\n\nThe power sunroof and the heated memory seats place the Envoy squarely in the luxury class. As you might expect, power is applied to the windows and remote control door locks.\n\nBecause the Envoy is intended to move people around in comfort more than it is to blaze trails, I packed my parents and brother inside for a trip to a posh Italian restaurant.\n\nIt seems almost de rigueur these days to ease up to a nice restaurant and have your stylish sport-utility valet-parked.\n\nLooking out the window a few moments after we were seated, I noticed the Envoy seemed a bit outclassed by various other expensive trucks. The Envoy is an older design that’s too square. Some curves here and there would give it a less formal (read: dowdy) look. The new model may address that, but I have my doubts.\n\nGM seems afraid of building anything that might offend anyone. So it keeps rolling out new vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Silverado and Buick LeSabre, that look nice but are virtually invisible in a world filling up quickly with stand-out designs.\n\nAnyway, GMC picked some very rich-looking colors for the paint and interior. Our test vehicle was painted a metallic silver. It had a luster and quality to it that the $60,000 Lexus LX470 sitting next to it couldn’t match.\n\nI found the driver’s seat to be comfortable, but my Dad said the rear seat was a bit too firm for his liking. The rear seat, by the way, splits and folds forward. It folds flat, so you can really stuff the cargo area. A pullout cover hides items stowed behind the seat.\n\nThe Envoy comes with a standard set of analog gauges and the same basic dash used in the GMC Jimmy/Oldsmobile Bravada/Chevrolet Blazer. It’s easy to use but not particularly attractive.\n\nDespite a few shortcomings, the Envoy is the right vehicle at the right time — but it’s facing some stiff competition. For just $75 more, you can get a Mercedes-Benz ML320. And a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a V-8 costs less.\n\n1999 GMC Envoy\n\nBase price: $33,600. Safety: Dual air bags, daytime running lights, side-impact protection and anti-lock brakes. Price as tested: $34,875. EPA rating: 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway. Incentives: None.",

      "expert_review": "Americans are peak users. We build and buy big houses, just in case we need the extra space. We arm our military services to a fare-thee-well, sometimes providing weapons the services haven’t requested, just in case we need the bombs. We build some of the word’s biggest and best sport-utility vehicles, giving them all kinds of capabilities and amenities, just in case we have to escape to the mountains at theater time.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that General Motors Corp. would develop one of the most capable, most luxurious sport-utility vehicles ever — the 2002 GMC Envoy XL?\n\nYes, the Envoy is a gilded lily. Its body structure and many of its components are shared with the generally less expensive Chevrolet TrailBlazer. But the Envoy is more than a work of badge engineering, which amounts to nothing more than using different nameplates on identical cars and trucks.\n\nThe old GM would have done that sort of thing, which is how the old GM got into trouble. The new GM is a much better company.\n\nEconomic common sense requires that all automakers use as many common parts as possible to help reduce vehicle development and production costs. Marketing common sense dictates that those vehicles be as different as possible in terms of customer perception.\n\nThe old GM had no marketing sense. It had something called “brand management,” which worked well for the managers but did nothing to sell products. The new GM has mastered the art of apparent diversification — altering closely related vehicles enough to appeal to different buyers at different prices. The proof is in the TrailBlazer and the Envoy, which appeal to psychically different groups.\n\nFor example, TrailBlazer buyers fit into what might be called the Just Folks League (JFL). They are peak users, too. They want a pickup truck or an SUV that can tow trailers weighing 5,800 to 6,400 pounds.\n\nOccasionally they would like to traverse unimproved mountain roads and ford streams. Surely they want to be prepared for the next killer snowstorm, or for torrential rainfalls that can turn roads into swamps and rivers. No true peak user wants to be stranded in a two-wheel-drive sedan in that kind of weather.\n\nBut unlike their brethren in the GMC Envoy, most TrailBlazer peak users are not obsessed with finery. Envoy buyers, on the other hand, are OKOPs (Our Kind of People). They prefer going to privately operated shelters in a natural or man-made disaster. To suffer is one thing. To suffer without leather, brushed aluminum, wood-grain accents and almost every conceivable amenity is something else. Envoy people are beyond bottled water. They’d much prefer wine and cheese in a pinch.\n\nUnderstandably, the executives and marketers at GMC, GM’s “professional grade” truck division, are reluctant to describe their peak users that way. What some malcontents see as greed, GMC’s marketers see as virtue.\n\n“W hat we’ve heard from our customers is they desire an SUV that can handle anything without compromising interior roominess and comfort,” said Tony DiSalle, the GMC Envoy’s marketing chief. “The new Envoy finally gives customers what they’re looking for — an SUV with an unmatched performance that is also surprisingly comfortable.”\n\nObjectively, it is hard to argue with DiSalle’s assessment. The tested Envoy XL model is a sumptuous, well-crafted piece of work. The seat leather is supple. The instrument panel, with its chronograph-type gauges, has a trapezoidal shape consistent with the Envoy’s exterior design. Floor space is uncluttered, allowing passengers to move around easily.\n\nLately, one of the biggest challenges in developing SUVs has been to give them limo-like rides on the highway without undermining their off-road toughness as trucks. Some auto companies have faked success in this endeavor by giving their luxo-SUVs modest all-wheel-drive capability and t en suggesting to buyers that those motorized dandies are perfectly capable of handling mud and rocks in the rough. The truth is, buyers of those sub-SUV models should keep them on the streets.\n\nBut the Envoy, properly equipped with items such as underbody skid plates, can kick it in the boonies. Its body-on-frame construction — featuring a new, stiffer frame — contributes to better handling and helps to keep it stable in unstable driving environments. Its big, 17-inch-diameter cast-aluminum wheels, shod with premium Michelin tires, enhance its footing. The Envoy’s 270-horsepower V-6 engine is more than enough to pull it out of trouble.\n\nGM and its GMC truck division have done a good job here. But that’s from the perspective of a truck lover. Opponents of this kind of well-done excess might see the Envoy as an emissary from the Dark Side, sent to seduce all those who love hating SUVs. That would make it a peak-use vehicle of another sort.",

      "expert_review": "A Useful Habitat for Hauling\n2004 GMC Envoy XUV SLT\n\nWe arrived with plants, lumber and other equipment needed to turn vacant lots into neighborhoods.\n\nIt was a Habitat for Humanity International housing development.\n\nI wish I could say I was part of the good work. I wasn’t. I just wanted to drive the 2004 GMC Envoy XUV SLT, a sport-utility vehicle that takes “utility” seriously.\n\nThe mission was part of a General Motors Corp. program to show that SUVs play useful roles in society — and that the Envoy XUV is designed to take center stage in Habitat and similar practical endeavors.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nThe volunteers building affordable houses in the early-summer heat were happy with the donated cargo. I was impressed with the Envoy XUV.\n\nSomehow, in the auto industry’s drive toward bigger and more luxurious sport-utility vehicles, the notion of “utility” got lost. It was supplanted by posh gimcrackery — supple leather seats, DVD players, super stereos.\n\nThat trend was followed — or, more precisely, joined — by the introduction of “crossover vehicles,” essentially station wagons masquerading as something larger than life, often possessed of marginal utility. The 2004 Chrysler Pacifica comes to mind.\n\nThe tested Envoy XUV SLT, by comparison, strikes the right balance. It has enough luxury — XM satellite radio, power seats and windows, leather surfaces, and a Bose Audio premium sound system — to please the average hedonist. It has enough room to accommodate a tailgate party of five. But in the matter of utility, it has something extra, or “Xtra,” as in “Xtra Utility Vehicle.”\n\nCheck out the tailgate. It has a power window and the ability to swing both ways — side to side or up and down. That makes it easy to load bags of gravel and groceries and other bulky packages.\n\nFlip the tailgate down. Collapse the rear seats. Flip down the Midgate after lowering its power glass window, which seals off the passenger compartment from the cargo area. Now you’ve got a perfect floor for loading plywood and drywall.\n\nWhat? How do you get a ladder or a tall sapling tree in there? That’s easy. Push a button. The cargo-area roof majestically slides forward. Stand the ladder and/or sapling tree atop the drywall and plywood. Use the four tie-down rings, which can be attached to any of 12 locations in the cargo area, to secure the ladder and the tree. Drive away with the confidence that everything will get to its destination without slipping or shifting around — or falling out.\n\nAnd, hey, it matters not how dirty you get the cargo area. Mud, dirt, gravel, sticky mess — put it all back there. Raise the Midgate window after loading, hauling and unloading. Grab a hose. Release the torrent. The cargo area has a patented “QuickDrain” system that can drain as much as 35 gallons of water a minute.\n\nIf you need detergent to clean the cargo bay, no problem. Soap it. Wet it. Scrub it. Rinse it. It’s all tough, all-weather composite material back there. It can take it.\n\nThe Envoy XUV can run, too. You can choose from two engines — the standard 4.2-liter, 275-horsepower in-line six-cylinder or the optional 5.3-liter, 290 horsepower V-8. I drove the V-8. I didn’t bother to measure 0-to-60-mph times. That sort of thing seems silly to me in an SUV loaded with building materials.\n\nBesides, I noticed something on the way to and from the Habitat for Humanity building site. I slowed down along with the Porsches, Corvettes and legions of pocket rockets when approached by the Michigan State Police.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: I have none at the moment. I’ll see what happens on a longer follow-up drive.\n\nPraise: GM is to be congratulated for using much of the thinking and many of the innovations employed in the Chevrolet Avalanche pickup truck wi hout producing a small Avalanche copy. The Envoy XUV has a completely different personality and feel from the big truck. In many ways, it is also more versatile.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent, carlike ride. Competent acceleration. Excellent handling, loaded and unloaded.\n\nHead-turning quotient: High. Many favorable looks — more than I received in the Acura MDX. But I drove the MDX in Honda-loving Washington and the XUV in GM-loving Michigan. Skewed views.\n\nCapacities: The Envoy XUV seats five people. Cargo capacity is 95.2 cubic feet with rear seat down and 49 cubic feet with rear seat up. The payload range is from 1,150 pounds (V-8 two-wheel-drive) to 1,305 pounds (V-8 four-wheel-drive). Depending on equipment, the Envoy XUV can be equipped to tow up to 6,400 pounds. Fuel capacity is 25 gallons of gasoline. Regular unleaded is okay.\n\nMileage: I averaged 17 miles per gallon mostly on the highway.\n\nEngines/transmissions: Both the 4.2-liter, 275-horsepower in-line six and the 5.3-liter, 290-hp V-8 come with an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nPrice: The Envoy XUV goes on sale this fall. Preliminary pricing ranges from $31,890 to $38,715, including a $650 destination charge, depending on vehicle type and equipment chosen.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a buy. Compare with any vehicle in the mid-size sport-utility category, including the Ford Explorer, Acura MDX/Honda Pilot, Toyota 4Runner or Mercedes-Benz M-Class.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewGMC revived the Envoy name for 2002 on a new midsize SUV related to the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. All models are available in rear- or four-wheel-drive powertrains. The Envoy comes with an inline-six-cylinder engine, while the high-end Denali edition gets its own V-8 powertrain with cylinder deactivation. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Toyota 4Runner. The Envoy can seat five people.  \nNew for 2009There are no significant changes for the 2009 GMC Envoy.\nExteriorA shield-shaped convex grille, wedged headlamps and boldly defined character lines help the Envoy fit in with GMC’s ‘professional grade’ theme. The upscale Denali edition also features a honeycomb grille with an integrated air dam to channel air to the engine. The Envoy measures 191.6 inches in length and 74.7 inches wide, similar to the 4Runner and Explorer but wider and longer than the Grand Cherokee. \n\nChrome bodyside moldings\nStandard 17-inch aluminum wheels\nOptional 18-inch high-polished forged-aluminum wheels\nTwo-wheel-drive Envoy Denali gets 20-inch polished-aluminum wheels\nAvailable assist steps\n\n\nInteriorThe Envoy has reclining front buckets and a split, folding rear bench seat. Interior appointments in the Denali version include leather seats with French-seam stitching. All Envoys come with standard quiet packaging, which includes a laminated windshield and strategically placed sound insulation material.\n Cargo volume behind the back seats measures 43.7 cubic feet. With the bench folded down, the Envoy offers 80.1 cubic feet of cargo space, which is similar to the Explorer but more than the 4Runner’s 75.1 cubic feet and the Grand Cherokee’s 67.4 cubic feet.  \n\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nStandard cruise control\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Bose audio and navigation system\nNew Bluetooth phone connectivity\n\n\nUnder the HoodAll Envoys come with a four-speed automatic transmission. Envoys are available with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which incorporates a two-speed transfer case. The only engine offered is an inline-six-cylinder; Denali trims come with an upgraded V-8.\n\n285-horsepower, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder (276 pounds-feet of torque)\n300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 (321 pounds-feet of torque) featuring cylinder-deactivation technology, which increases    fuel economy by shutting off four cylinders at highway speeds\nAir-adjustable load-leveling suspension system (Denali edition)\nEngine block heater (optional on four-wheel-drive models)\n\n\nSafetyNo side-impact thorax airbags are offered, but side curtain airbags for the first and second rows can sense an    impending rollover and deploy.

      "expert_review": "Options? Who needs more options when it comes to buying a sport utility vehicle?\n\nGlut wouldn’t begin to characterize the market these days. Gobs of competition might fit.\n\nTurn a corner and you run into SUVs. Turn around and you back into them. So what did General Motors do when it unveiled its latest round of enhancements on its Envoy?\n\nWhy, it provided more options. And it’s exactly what we’ve been waiting for. GMC didn’t revamp its Envoy when it rolled it out for a new year, it gave you a few more choices. In that way, the automaker’s best mid-size ride just got a whole lot better. Tons of family coming to town? Midway through last year GM introduced the possibility of seven-passenger seating. Looking to trim costs? To help buyers, there now are more options available individually, rather than as part of an equipment package, adding flexibility in the showroom. And the best option of all, a new Vortec 5300 V-8 engine that gives the Envoy one of the most powerful powerplants in its class.\n\nDecisions. Decisions.\n\nMotor Trend’s 2002 Sport/Utility of the Year was already a decent ride when it rolled up in our driveway. Its six or eight cylinder power, clean interior design and plenty of cargo and passenger room made it a strong contender when compared to the Ford Explorers of the world.\n\nBut where the new Envoy one-ups the competition is in one area that matters to most SUV buyers: Comfort, cargo and … did we mention cargo? That means people and things. And with a wheelbase stretched 16 inches, the Envoy XL, our ride for a week, provides the opportunity for all that in spades by adding a third-row seat. Not just any third row, mind you. A comfortable third row.\n\nIn this SUV-mad world, the idea of having the ability to seat as many as seven is a popular one. The only problem was that it wasn’t always that comfortable. Inevitably, someone would have to sit on someone else’s lap, and someone else would have to sit pressed to the side window. Not good.\n\nThe Envoy XL is true seven-passenger capability in a mid-size ride. GM says it can comfortably accommodate two 6-foot-2, 190-pound male riders. We could only round up a 6-foot guy and his 5-foot-10, 200-pound friend, but they found the third row a treat – not a squeeze.\n\nBut then there’s the best option of all: Remove that third row and you’re really in business. Suddenly, the Envoy becomes the ambassador for better hauling – as much as 100 cubic feet of room, or almost 20 more than a seven-passenger Explorer.\n\nOther than the extension in length, the Envoy XL is pretty much still an Envoy. Which means, if you’re like us, you’ll like it just fine. Serious horsepower, or that push you get from your right foot, flows through its veins from a 4.2-liter, 24-valve inline six-cylinder, or the powerful 5.3-liter V-8 . Rated at 275 horsepower, the V-6 engine flexes against the best, out muscling most of the competition’s V-6’s and V-8’s. In the Envoy’s V-8 it gets even more massive. Hit the gas and watch the real options fly by: Should we take the highway or the back roads?\n\nWith the Envoy, you’ll enjoy the view.\n\nAvailable in rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, it has the tug of a vehicle serious about getting somewhere with authority even if things are a little mushy around the corners. With a reworked suspension, we did find things a touch too smooth, maybe a little too pleasing. Not quite the road feel of the Explorer’s fully independent suspension – more numb than we’d like – but if you’re looking for pure comfort, it probably can’t be beat.\n\nStill, it is a vehicle that travels better than it looks. And in the XL model, it looks large. Available in two trim levels, base SLE and upscale SLT, the Envoy comes dressed to impress. Lots of standard features, including dual-zone climate control, OnStar communications system, dual front and side air bag and a jazzy stereo setup. In SLT versions, you add on a driver information center, automatic climate control and lots of leather.\n\nOn safety, the Envoy XL gets air bags from nearly every angle as well as standard disc brakes with ABS.\n\nOn style, the interior of the Envoy will turn a few heads. The cabin is spacious and filled with less plastic than the GM rides we’ve had in the past. Brushed nickel accents are all over the place – console, instrument panel – and wood accents give the SLT a bit of class. Headsets are fully adjustable and front seats have lumbar and power options for getting comfortable.\n\nOne interesting addition and one warning: This year the Envoy and Envoy XL even received larger fuel tanks for longer driving range between fills. But be prepared to spend the cash.\n\nLike a lot of other SUVs, the Envoy goes 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway, although our experience had us more in the 13/17 range. GM even estimates the fuel cost on the Envoy at $1,367 per year. That’s a few tanks.\n\nAnd on price, the Envoy falls right in line with the competition. A little higher in the base price ($30,370 in the XL 2WD) but right there in the top end ($37,375).\n\nBut, as we said, that can be raised or lowered depending on what you’d like. Third row? No third row? Bigger engine? Smaller engine?\n\nDecisions. Decisions.\n\n2003 GMC Envoy XL\n\nHigh Gear: A strong six- or eight-cylinder engine gives power at the push of a pedal. Serious cargo space and a third-row seat that’s actually comfortable give the Envoy an edge on the competition.\n\nLow gear: A new suspension has made the ride more comfortable but maybe too mushy in the corners. Gasoline mileage, as in any SUV, is a lose-lose proposition.\n\nRating: 3\n\nVehicle type (XL 2WD): Rear-wheel drive, front-engine, four-door, seven-passenger mid-size sport utility vehicle.\n\nKey standard equipment (XL): Tilt steering; cruise control; dual front air bags; four-wheel antilock brakes; daytime running lights; theft-deterrent system; adjustable lumbar front seats; dual-zone heat and air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with six speakers; power windows, doors and locks; split-folding rear seats; heavy-duty tailoring equipment; integral fog lamps.\n\nCompetition: Ford Explorer, Buick Rendezvous, Acura MDX, Honda Pilot\n\nEngine (XL): 290 horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8\n\nTorque: 325 foot-lbs. @ 3,600 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 129 inches\n\nLength: 207.6 inches\n\nMPG rating (city/highway): 15/19\n\nManufactured: Oklahoma City, OK.\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles; powertrain warranty is three years/36,000 miles; rust pe rforation warranty is six years/100,000 miles; roadside warranty is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price (XL 2WD): $30,370\n\nPrice as tested (XL, includes options, destination and delivery charges): $34,630",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC revived the Envoy name for 2002 on a brand-new midsize model related to the Chevrolet TrailBlazer.\n\nFor 2007, little has changed on the Envoy aside from new colors and new 18-inch wheels on SLE and SLT trims.\n\nAll models come standard with General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system. The regular Envoy’s 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine is standard on all but the Denali models, which have a 5.3-liter V-8.\n\nEnvoys equipped with V-8 engines have Displacement on Demand technology to improve fuel economy.\n\nUpscale Denali editions of the Envoy feature aluminum wheels, honeycomb grilles and an integrated air dam to channel air to the engine. Interior appointments include Nuance leather seats with French seam stitching, and the front seats are heated.\n\nExterior\nFor 2007, Silvermist Metallic, Midnight Blue Metallic and Graphite Metallic are new colors.\n\nA shield-shaped grille helps give the four-door Envoy a distinct identity. Denali versions feature 18-inch tires. A rear load-leveling suspension is available. The five-passenger Envoy rides on a 113-inch wheelbase, measures 191.6 inches long overall and stands 71.9 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nAs many as five occupants can fit inside the Envoy, which contains reclining front bucket seats and a split, folding rear seat. XM Satellite Radio, an MP3-capable CD player and a DVD-based entertainment system are optional. Power-adjustable pedals are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEnvoy is equipped with a 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder. It boasts 291 horsepower. Envoy Denalis feature a 300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 that uses Displacement on Demand technology. All models use a four-speed automatic transmission. Envoys have either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which incorporates a two-speed transfer case.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and StabiliTrak are standard. Side curtain airbags are optional. For 2007, a tire pressure monitoring system is standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nGMC’s Envoy rivals the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess. While tromping on the gas to pass, the inline-six exudes confidence. Not only is engine sound barely noticeable, but road noise is also virtually absent.\n\nThe regular-suspension Envoy rides similar to a car on smooth surfaces. The ride softens, but not dramatically, with the available load-leveling suspension. Handling is on the slow side, but the SUV has a satisfying steering feel.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC revived the Envoy name for 2002 on a brand-new midsize model related to the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. The five-passenger Envoy arrived first, and GMC soon added the extended-length seven-passenger Envoy XL that featured three rows of seats.\n\nAll 2006 models come standard with General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system. The regular Envoy’s 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine has slightly more power for 2006, and a 5.3-liter V-8 is still offered for Denali models.\n\nFor 2006, V-8-equipped Envoys gain Displacement on Demand technology to improve fuel economy. The system was previously optional.\n\nUpscale Denali editions of the Envoy and Envoy XL feature aluminum wheels, honeycomb grilles and an integrated air dam to channel air to the engine. Interior appointments include Nuance leather seats with French seam stitching, and the front seats are heated.\n\nThe Envoy XUV, which debuted in 2004 and featured a power-sliding rear roof, has been discontinued.\n\nExterior\nA shield-shaped grille helps give the four-door Envoy a distinct identity. For 2006, non-Denali editions get slight exterior updates and standard cast-aluminum wheels that hold 17-inch tires; Denali versions feature 18-inch tires. A rear load-leveling suspension is available. The five-passenger Envoy rides on a 113-inch wheelbase, measures 191.6 inches long overall and stands 71.9 inches tall. The extended-wheelbase Envoy XL rides a 129-inch wheelbase, stretches to 207.6 inches long overall and is 3.6 inches taller.\n\nInterior\nAs many as five occupants can fit inside the Envoy, which contains reclining front bucket seats and a split, folding rear seat. The Envoy XL seats up to seven with its additional folding two-place third-row seat. The Envoy XL’s maximum cargo volume is 107.4 cubic feet, versus 80.1 cubic feet in the shorter Envoy. XM Satellite Radio, an MP3-capable CD player and a DVD-based entertainment system are optional. Power-adjustable pedals are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEnvoy and Envoy XL models are equipped with a 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder. It’s been upgraded for 2006 and now boasts 291 horsepower, up from 275 hp in previous years. Envoy Denalis feature a 300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 that uses Displacement on Demand technology. All models use a four-speed-automatic transmission. Envoys have either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which incorporates a two-speed transfer case.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and StabiliTrak are standard. Side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nGMC’s Envoy rivals the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess. While tromping on the gas to pass, the inline-six exudes confidence. Not only is engine sound barely noticeable, but road noise is also virtually absent.\n\nThe regular-suspension Envoy rides similar to a car on smooth surfaces. The ride softens, but not dramatically, with the available load-leveling suspension. Handling is on the slow side, but the SUV has a satisfying steering feel. An extra-smooth ride is part of the Envoy XL’s attraction, but quite a bit of body roll is evident.",

      "expert_review": "Hard to imagine that GMC has been using the Denali name on premium sport utes for eight model years now, but it’s true, and the Denali family keeps growing: For 2005, there’s a GMC Envoy Denali, and it’s pretty much like Denalis before it — essentially the same as non-Denali models, but nicer.\n\nThe original Denali — that’s the native name for Alaska’s Mount McKinley — was a full-size Yukon model, GMC’s twin to the Chevrolet Tahoe. While mechanically similar, the Denali versions are downright loaded, with lots of leather and wood and standard features that would otherwise be optional. That’s the case with the Envoy Denali. And like other Denali models, it has some minor exterior updates, plus the trademark chrome-plated honeycomb grille.\n\nThe GMC Envoy was introduced in 2002 as a direct competitor to the class-leading Ford Explorer. Give GM credit for making the most out of this one SUV platform, as the Envoy shares its mechanicals with the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, Oldsmobile Bravada, Isuzu Ascender, Buick Rainier and Saab 9-7X.\n\nThe Envoy comes in two lengths — the regular five-passenger model, plus an extended model, the Envoy XL, that offers a third-row seat. The Denali package is available in both. The test vehicle was a regular-length Envoy Denali, which was fine, as I’m not a fan of the tail-heavy handling of the longer versions of the model.\n\nWhile a 4.2-liter six-cylinder engine is standard in the Envoy, the Denali comes only with the 300-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8, with a four-speed automatic transmission. For reasons I don’t quite understand, GM’s “displacement on demand” is only used on the V-8 in the Envoy Denali XL. It’s a system that shuts down four of the eight cylinders when their power isn’t needed, thus increasing gas mileage as much as 8 percent, GM says. DaimlerChrysler has a similar system. As it is, EPA-rated mileage on the test Denali without the system was 16 miles per gallon city, 20 mpg highway. There’s plenty of power, smoothly delivered, and a towing capacity of 7,100 pounds.\n\nThe Envoy Denali has premium Bilstein shock absorbers and a load-leveling suspension, making this one of the best-riding SUVs on the market. And due in part to the larger P245/65R-17 tires and wheels, it handles well too.\n\nInside, most every feature you would want is found, along with the expected wood and leather. Though there is a long list of standard features with the Denali model, there were options on the test vehicle too: A navigation system added $1,600, side and side-curtain air bags were $495, and a “Sun, Sound and Entertainment Package” got us a power sunroof, XM satellite radio and a six-disc CD changer for $1,370.\n\nWith this system, the DVD that operates the navigation system slips into a slot on the stereo, where you would assume your music CDs would go. Do that, and you’ll have to make a trip to the dealer to retrieve your stuck CD and get the nav system working again. There may be a more idiotic feature on a new vehicle, but I’m unable to think of one.\n\nOtherwise, there isn’t much to complain about. The Envoy Denali does everything it’s supposed to, but it comes at a price: List is $40,225. If you want four-wheel-drive, that’s about $2,000 more. If you want a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, that’s another option, and you’ll need to give up the sunroof for the flip-down screen.\n\nAs with the regular GMC Yukon, though, you can get a very nice Envoy without paying for the Denali models. But judging from the success of the Denali, and the early reception to the Envoy Denali, there’s a substantial segment of buyers who want it all.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC revived the Envoy name for 2002 on a brand-new midsize model related to the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. For 2008, all trim levels of the five-seat Envoy have standard side curtain airbags and XM Satellite Radio. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nAll models come standard with an electronic stability system. A 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine is standard on all but the Denali models, which have a 5.3-liter V-8 that features Displacement on Demand technology to improve fuel economy.\n\nFor 2008, two-wheel-drive Envoy Denalis get 20-inch polished-aluminum wheels. The upscale Denali editions also feature honeycomb grilles and an integrated air dam to channel air to the engine. Interior appointments include Nuance leather seats with French seam stitching, and the front seats are heated.\n\nExterior\nA shield-shaped grille helps give the four-door Envoy a distinct identity. Standard aluminum wheels measure 17 inches in diameter, and a rear load-leveling suspension is available. The Envoy rides on a 113-inch wheelbase, measures 191.6 inches long overall and stands 71.9 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nThe Envoy contains reclining front bucket seats and a split, folding rear seat. Bose audio, a navigation system, a DVD-based entertainment system and power-adjustable pedals are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Envoy’s 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder makes 285 horsepower. Envoy Denalis feature a 300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8. All models use a four-speed automatic transmission. Envoys have either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which incorporates a two-speed transfer case.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, electronic stability control and side curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nGMC’s Envoy rivals the Ford Explorer in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess. While tromping on the gas to pass, the inline-six exudes confidence. Not only is engine sound barely noticeable, but road noise is also virtually absent.\n\nThe regular-suspension Envoy rides similar to a car on smooth surfaces. The ride softens, but not dramatically, with the available load-leveling suspension. Handling is on the slow side, but the SUV has a satisfying steering feel.",
