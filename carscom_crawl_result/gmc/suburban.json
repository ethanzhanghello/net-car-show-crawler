      "expert_review": "This East Texas town is so removed from Washington in distance and thought, the residents have a hard time figuring out the mind-set of the nation’s capital.\n\nTake Washington’s neuroses over rising sales of sport-utility vehicles, such as the 1998 GMC Suburban SLT that I drove here. Marshall’s folks don’t understand what all the fuss is about.\n\n“You say people in Washington are worried about big trucks crushing small cars?” asked Jay Denson, sitting in his uncle’s fully loaded, full-size GMC Sierra pickup in a church parking lot.\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “They believe too many trucks on the road makes things dangerous for people in cars.”\n\n“That’s the dumbest thing,” Denson said. “Y’all don’t have no farms up there? Farms! Ranches! You got animals of all sizes on farms and ranches, cows and pigs, cattle and chickens. The damned chickens have sense enough to stay out of the way of the damned cows!”\n\nDenson pointed to the Suburban SLT that I was test-driving, parked next to his pickup. “We got lots of 18-wheelers round here. Be careful. To them, your Suburban ain’t nothin’ but another chicken.”\n\nThe good thing about sport-utility vehicles, especially ones as big as the Suburban SLT, is that they help you to overcome humiliation. I rose above Denson’s put-downs the moment I climbed behind the Suburban SLT’s wheel, where I felt like king of the road, lord of the flies.\n\nIt was more than a feeling. The Suburban SLT is 18.3 feet long, 6.4 feet wide, 5.9 feet high. Its rear axle clears the ground by 6.6 inches. Its driver’s seat is thus akin to a throne, from which you look down on everything except, of course, those 18-wheelers.\n\nYou’d think that, with its size and weight — it tips the scales at 5,297 pounds in the tested four-wheel-drive version — the Suburban SLT would be a beast to drive. It’s not. The test truck handled so easily, some of the folks here complained that it was not “trucky” enough, which, to them, is an insult.\n\nIt didn’t muchhelp matters that the test vehicle came with soft leather seats, which some of the local people disparaged as foppish, playboy stuff. Nor were they impressed with the Suburban SLT’s optional OnStar system, a guidance, emergency aid and vehicle-tracking system that links the vehicle to a 24-hour communications service via geo-positioning satellites.\n\nI found OnStar useful for directions on the nearly 3,000-mile trip from Washington to Texas to Louisiana and back. But a couple of folks I spoke to here regarded OnStar as a silly excess. “Don’t you know how to use a map?” one asked.\n\nBut everybody praised the Suburban SLT’s 5.7-liter V-8 engine, which produces 255 horsepower at 4,600 rpm and 330 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 rpm. “A monster,” said the owner of a 1992 Suburban. “Kicks plenty of butt,” said another citizen, who regularly drives a Ford F-250 pickup with a double rear axle.\n\nNo one I spoke to here complained about the Suburban SLT’s appetite for fuel or its supposed co ntributions to global warming. There are just too many farm tractors, trailers, combines and cows in these parts to worry about what’s coming out of the tail pipe of a truck, some of the region’s folks said.\n\n“Shoot. You wanna get a whiff of global warming, you just hang around one of these farms on a hot summer’s day,” said a man in nearby Shreveport, La.\n\n1998 GMC Suburban SLT\n\nComplaints: The instrument panel is ergonomically distressing. The dashboard is too long, and the dials, such as those for the radio and climate- control system, are too far apart. GMC should do to the Suburban’s panel what it did to the one in the smaller 1998 Jimmy — slant the controls more toward the driver.\n\nPraise: Just a fine, big, well-made truck that can pull a 6,000-pound trailer, seat seven people and carry up to 2,003 pounds of stuff.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Suburban SLT looks a lot better in rural areas and small towns than it does in the city, where it draws hostile looks from garage attendants.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: As good as it gets in a big truck. But real truckmeisters complain that the ride is too soft. Excellent braking (power front discs/rear drums with antilock backup) on a variety of surfaces.\n\nMileage: About 16 miles per gallon. Fuel tank holds 42 gallons of recommended 87-octane unleaded. Average travel range with four occupants and 800 pounds of cargo was 650 miles.\n\nSound system: AM-FM stereo radio and cassette with console-mounted, single-disc CD player. Installed by GM/Delco. Okay.\n\nSafety: Ha! Just wear your seat belts, stay out of the way of 18-wheelers and pray that everything smaller than a Suburban stays out of your way.\n\nPrice: Base price is $28,129. Dealer’s invoice price is $24,612. Price as tested is $37,742 plus a $675 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Suburban is the biggest sport-utility vehicle available. It’s not for everyone. Check out the Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon, Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Dodge Durango and Mitsubishi Montero, all of which are big enough to handle most civilian transportation needs.",

      "expert_review": "The big GMC Suburban just may be the most efficient method of moving people and cargo short of a Greyhound bus or a tractor-trailer rig.\n\nAt more than 18 feet in length, the four-door Suburban is one of the biggest and heaviest family vehicles you can buy.\n\nFor such a large vehicle, it’s also extremely comfortable and very easy to drive.\n\nFor now, General Motors, which markets the Suburban under the GMC and Chevrolet nameplates, has no competition, but Ford and Dodge are busy designing their own Suburban-like vehicles.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nTwo- or four-wheel drive, gas or diesel you can order the Suburban just about any way you want it.\n\nThe base engine is a 210-horsepower 5.7-liter (350 cubic inch) V-8. On heavy-duty models, a special, lower-compression version of the 5.7-liter engine is standard.\n\nYou also can buy the Suburban with a massive 7.4-liter (454 cubic inch) gasoline V-8 that provides enough power to tow 10,000 pounds. Or, if you would use the Suburban on long highway trips, then the more fuel efficient 6.5-liter turbocharged diesel V-8 engine might make the better choice.\n\nOur test vehicle, an SLE model, came with the standard 5.7-liter engine, a power plant that provided excellent performance and decent fuel economy.\n\nThe Suburban has a curb weight of better than 5,500 pounds. That means its cast iron V-8 engine has a lot of weight to pull, yet it does so smoothly and without hesitation. Acceleration is moderately brisk, shifts are crisp and well-timed, and there’s plenty of power for passing slower traffic on the highway.\n\nAll Suburbans are built with a computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOn an extended highway trip, the Suburban got 16 miles per gallon with the air conditioner running.\n\nOur red and gray Suburban test vehicle traveled just over 400 miles in combined city-highway driving before emptying its 42-gallon gas tank.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Suburban maybe a large and heavy vehicle, but it is fairly agile, and it’s surprisingly easy to maneuver.\n\nFor instance, driving in and out of tight places such as parking lots presents no problem because GMC engineers made the steering system light, so the wheel is easy to turn. Sometimes though, the vehicle’s size can cause a problem. It’s so big, you really have to watch when you back up.\n\nThe ride is another surprise. The Suburban is exceptionally smooth and very quiet at highway speeds. Perhaps all that weight just flattens out the bumps. In any case, very little energy generated by bumps and road imperfections finds its way through the Suburban’s frame and chassis to the interior. Only on very rough terrain will you notice that the body undulates slightly.\n\nThe suspension system – coil springs and shocks up front and a leaf spring axle in the rear – offers nothing very high tech. Yet it works extremely well.\n\nBrakes are another area where GMC engineers have done a good job. The anti-lock disc/drum set up in our test vehicle offered strong, fade-free stops. However, the anti-lock system seemed to make a lot of noise, but it worked well and allowed the Suburban to remain easy to steer in an emergency stop.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nSLE stands for Sport Luxury Edition. Our test vehicle was indeed sporty and luxurious. It should be, what with $9,232 worth of options.\n\nThe optional ($1,380) gray leather seats gave the test vehicle’s interior a classy and rich ambiance. The leather was soft and luxurious. The electrically adjustable front bucket seats can hold a body comfortably for hour after hour of driving. I took a seven-hour stop-and-go trip antique hunting up the east coast of Florida and felt fine after 250 miles.\n\nOur test vehicle was outfitted with two rear bench seats, which gave the Suburban the ability to hold up to eight people. It also had a rear air-conditioning system and literally every user-friendly creature comfo t item that you expect to find in a luxury car.\n\nFor instance, our test vehicle came with a full gauge package, rear window defroster and rear wiper, cruise control, AM/FM stereo cassette with built-in equalizer, aluminum wheels, scads of power equipment (mirrors, windows, locks, seats) and a large center console.\n\nI didn’t really care for the two-tone paint scheme, gray over red. I think the Suburban would look much better all one color, such as dark metallic green.\n\nThe only gripe I have involves the fuel gauge. When the tank is about half empty, the fuel gauge fluctuates wildly when you go around corners.\n\nOther than that, I found the switches and controls easy to use and, in most instances, placed within quick reach. Door window switches are lighted for nighttime driving.\n\nThe big center console can hold large items, and it contains a cup holder.\n\nVisibility is generally good, though sometimes there is a rather large blind spot on either side but probably no worse a blind spot than on any other large vehicle.\n\nAll in all, the Suburban is a civilized workhorse.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $20,476 EPA rating: 13 mpg city/17 highway Price as tested: $30,348 Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The GMC Suburban is the ultimate family utility vehicle. It’s versatile, well-built and strong, and the buyer can outfit it to suit nearly any purpose, from towing heavy loads to hauling people.",

      "expert_review": "A weekend on the road with GMC’s Suburban gave me a better understanding of why people love these things so much. It is the quintessential cruiser, capable of reeling off 400 miles without a hiccup, or a stop for gas.\n\nAnd, it did so with all of the comfort and convenience of a full-on luxury sedan.\n\nI’ve always found the Suburban’s size to be a bit daunting around town. I mean, how many people really need seating for nine? Yet, here we were, just my wife and I, with all of this unused space, ready to log nearly 800 miles in two days. Even though this baby is bigger’n Dallas, it rolls down the highway effortlessly and never really feels cumbersome, despite its long, 131.5-inch wheelbase, truck chassis and curb weight of more than 5,200 pounds.\n\nThe long wheelbase is a major contributor to its comfort level. We hammered down the interstate at a brisk pace and even though the ride was plush, it did not have that loose and mushy feeling of land yachts from the previous decades.\n\nAbout the only things I wished for were better seats and greater gas mileage. We averaged just over 14.4 mpg on our trip (the EPA rating is 16 on the highway, but that is not calculated for 70 mph). The 42-gallon gas tank costs a fortune to fill up, but it allows a cruising range of 630 miles, which means you can get to Denver without having to stop for gas, a great benefit when time is of the essence.\n\nOur test car was a four-wheel drive, 1500 series, and it sat pretty high. Getting in was a bit of a stretch, but the driving position was excellent because I had a panoramic view of traffic and could see over the top of many smaller cars.\n\nElectronic, speed-sensitive power steering was added this year for enhanced feel, but I thought it was overboosted at low speeds. The turning radius is tighter this year too.\n\nThe engine in our test unit was the 5.7-liter, Vortec V8 with 255 horsepower. While that might sound like a lot of power, the Suburban weighs a lot and that eats up much of it. This engine puts out lots of torque, or pulling power, at 2,800 rpm, which means you don’t have to wring its neck to get up to cruising speed or to blend into the freeway. It can tow 6,000 pounds.\n\nThere are two other optional engines: a 6.5-liter, turbo-diesel V8 and a 7.4-liter gasoline V8.\n\nThe seats, swathed in leather, were pretty good, but after four hours I longed for more support, particularly in the lumbar area.\n\nBetween the front seats is a huge console that looks like a small cooler. It has a notepadholder on top which is handy for keeping route notes, plus storage for CDs, maps, etc.\n\nA dual cupholder pulls out from the center of the dash, or you can replace the CD holder in the console with an additional cupholder.\n\nI would like to see GMC borrow Pontiac’s steering-wheel controls for the radio because it was a pretty far reach for changing stations and adjusting volume.\n\nThere are two back seats, which is how you can fit eight or nine people inside. The third seat has limited legroom, but would be good for kids, dogs, etc. The second-row seat is a split-folding bench, but you have to tumble the seat bottom forward and remove the headrest from the seat back in order to fold it down. Folding both seats down reveals 149 cubic feet of cargo space, which is huge.\n\nOther amenities, such as rear-seat air conditioning and dual airbags, add safety as well as comfort.\n\nAccess to the luggage compartment of our test unit was through two side-hinged panel doors, and they were easy to use. Their only drawback is that they cannot be equipped with a rear wiper. A switch enables all doors to be locked or unlocked from the back, a nice touch.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price for our test unit was $27,313. The option list was long: tinted windows, power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, power locks, power mirrors, power seat, keyless entry, 16-inch aluminum wheels, 3.73 axle rat , trailer towing package, running boards, locking rear differential and electronic shifting transfer case.\n\nThe sticker price was $38,563.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Suburban is right at home cruising the highways. With a 630-mile range and seating for nine it has an immense following among big families and outdoor types.\n\nCounterpoint: This is a thirsty beast. I averaged 14.4 mpg with only two people aboard.\n\nIt is pricey, too, but then so are most other full-size SUVs.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.7-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION:automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 131.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,235 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $27,313\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $38,563.\n\nMPG RATING: 12 city, 16 hwy.",
