      "expert_review": "When it comes to pickup truck reviews, we at Cars.com can’t outdo our partners at PickupTrucks.com, whose reviews of the GMC Sierra Hybrid and its sister, the Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, are comprehensive. What we can do is put a truck through the urban test, which is useful when that truck is a hybrid. Our thinking was that a city test would be a great trial of the 2-Mode Hybrid system’s efficiency during a stop-and-go urban commute. In reality, however, driving the Sierra Hybrid in the city for a week consisted of three main activities:\n\n1. Offsetting any hybrid fuel savings by driving around looking for a parking space.\n2. Sneaking up on pedestrians and scaring the crap out of them.\n3. Explaining to city dwellers that “hybrid pickup” isn’t an oxymoron.\n\nI deny implications that I enjoyed any of these tasks.\n\n1. High Frustration, but Higher Mileage\nAs for the truck’s performance in city driving, I was disappointed initially. First, my plan to crawl to work in bumper-to-bumper traffic was quashed: Though I intentionally waited for peak rush hour before leaving home, I met unprecedented light traffic. Most days — when I’m in a hurry — every slowdown, every pothole, every sprinkling of rain, every eyeful of bright sunshine brings out the weenie in motorists. But on this particular day, the interstate was a freakin’ drag strip. The trip computer read 20 mpg the whole time — as advertised for my Sierra Hybrid 4×4.\n\nNext time around, it looked like I was in for the same until I came upon an apparent weenie convention, after which the speedometer stayed below 7 mph for around 10 minutes. The average mpg decreased to 19 mpg, then gradually but continuously fell below 18 mpg as I crept along — sometimes on electric power, sometimes not. Once the weenie convention broke up, the rest of the commute ranged between 25 and 45 mph, and the average mpg climbed again — this time above 20.\n\nThe slow-and-go definitely delivered better numbers than the stop-and-go, but unfortunately the challenges of finding street parking in the city led to a lot of the latter, as well as a lot of wasted time and, it seemed, a lot of wasted gas. Once I thought it through, however, I recognized how easy it is to see 15 frustrating minutes seeking out parking, or 10 minutes in a traffic jam, as offsetting any higher-speed advantages, yet how little those things mean in terms of overall consumption. In short, regardless of the time spent in gridlock, 14 mpg over the course of an eighth of a mile isn’t the same as 14 mpg over eight miles. The issue is miles per gallon, not miles per minute, and a truck with an engine that can stop and go along with the traffic is still better than one without.\n\n2. It’s Only Funny Until Someone Has a Coronary\nAnyone who owns a full-hybrid car knows what it’s like to accidentally startle a pedestrian by coasting noiselessly to a stoplight or turning a corner powered by the electric motor alone. I now know that there are different levels of startle: There’s the Prius level, in which someone stops short, wearing an expression of mild surprise, after almost walking into or in front of your car. Then there’s the stealth-pickup startle, in which a cell-phone impaired pedestrian steps off the curb, glances to the left, sees nothing but grille, freaks, and drops his phone, which then tumbles into a sewer.\n\nI recognized that an unexpected faceful of grille could be hazardous to, say, a tourist who’s dodgy on the heart, so I went out of my way to avoid silent approaches … after doing it a few dozen times more in Chicago’s business district. (No additional mobile phones were harmed during this experiment.)\n\nA cyclist illustrated just how quiet the cabin of a Sierra Hybrid is by sneezing when I motored past her. My passenger rolled down the window and said “Bless you” — a courtesy that seems to befit a hybrid more than a pickup. I don’t actually believe in intimidating other motorists with a truck, but I fathom there are advantages to hypermiling in one. The practice — whereby you maximize your mileage by accelerating very slowly, braking gently and even driving at or below the speed limit — has been known to provoke road rage among the drivers behind you. You’re more likely to get a nine-iron through the windshield of a Prius than a GMC.\n\nIn terms of noise, the Sierra Hybrid wasn’t perfect. The 2-Mode system at work occasionally sounds like an approaching siren; it’s muted and it comes from no clear direction, but that’s exactly what a fire truck or ambulance sounds like in the urban jungle, so you do a lot of looking around and creeping cautiously into intersections.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to the sound it makes when you turn the ignition off. A bizarre combination of swirling, whooshing and chattering emanates from the dashboard for about 30 seconds. I have no idea what’s going on in there, but it sounds like the chipmunk olympics.\n\n3. Yes, City Snobs: A Hybrid Pickup\nThankfully, here in the Midwest people aren’t under the mistaken impression that “no one wants to buy American cars,” and overall I think Chicago is pretty chill for a metropolis, but a lot of city dwellers don’t understand pickup trucks. These are people who think of pickups as wasteful, unnecessary image vehicles. One person told me you only need a pickup “if you live on a ranch.” I should mention these are invariably the same people who magically recognize — when it comes time to relocate or buy some furniture or antiques — that pickup trucks are mighty useful, and, Hey, look at that! Their dear friend Joe has one for the weekend!\n\nWhat’s even harder to understand is why anyone thinks hybrid technology belongs only in small cars. Why is making a small, efficient car more efficient better than making a large, guzzly vehicle less of a guzzler? The ranks of casual pickup buyers definitely has swelled over the past few years, but that trend is on the wane. The truth is — as it has always been — pickups are purchased overwhelmingly by people who truly need them, or at least are dead-set on owning one. Consequently, any hybrid pickup purchased is taking the place of a non-hybrid. In other words, someone’s driving a more efficient truck than they otherwise would. How can that be bad? Apart from producing less carbon dioxide, hybrids cost more than equivalent non-hybrids, and that’s good for the economy and the embattled manufacturers. GM’s 2-Mode Hybrid system provides a not-insignificant increase in overall mileage and roughly 50 percent better mileage in city driving.\n\nSierra Hybrid in the Market\nA rancher or a contractor who drives high-speed rural roads from jobsite to jobsite might not be able to justify the hybrid’s higher price, and you’re definitely better off with the gas-only version if you need full towing and hauling capacity. But the Sierra Hybrid should help cut fuel costs for any city- or suburban-based tradesman. It certainly can’t hurt.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGM says the Sierra 1500 Hybrid’s gasoline V-8 and electric motors team up for an overall mileage improvement of 25 percent compared with the regular Sierra. The Sierra Hybrid is only available as a rear- or four-wheel-drive crew cab, both with a newly flex-fuel capable 6.0-liter V-8 and two electric transmission motors. Standard features include a trailering package, locking rear differential and side curtain airbags.\n\nExterior\nAlongside the Sierra Hybrid’s lower panels are optional green stripes with “hybrid” in capital letters. There’s also hybrid badging on the cab’s rear window, ahead of the side mirrors and on the tailgate.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Silverado Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people.\n\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nFuel economy gauge\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nGM’s two-mode hybrid system enables “full” hybrid operation with the capability to cruise on electric power up to 20 mph. The gas engine kicks in if more acceleration is needed, as well as at higher speeds; for maximum grunt, the electric motors and gas engine work together.\n\nAt the heart of the Sierra Hybrid is a 6.0-liter V-8 that teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two 60-kilowatt electric motors. The motors draw power from a 300-volt battery pack, which recharges itself off the friction generated when you hit the brakes. The engine makes 332 horsepower and enables a towing capacity of 6,100 pounds with rear-wheel drive and 5,900 pounds with four-wheel drive — not as much as the regular Sierra’s 10,500-pound maximum towing capacity, but not too shabby for a hybrid.\n\nGM says gas mileage is up 40 percent in the city and 25 percent overall versus the gasoline Sierra\nE85 flex-fuel compatibility new for 2010\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain and side-impact airbags",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nGM says the Sierra 1500 Hybrid’s gasoline V-8 and electric motors team up for an overall mileage improvement compared with the regular Sierra. The Sierra Hybrid is available only as a rear- or four-wheel-drive crew cab, both with a 6.0-liter V-8 and two electric transmission motors. The pickup truck can seat up to six people. Standard features include a trailering package, locking rear differential and side curtain airbags.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nThere’s hybrid badging on the cab’s rear window, ahead of the side mirrors and on the tailgate, but otherwise the hybrid version looks similar to the gas-powered Sierra. Exterior features include:\n\n\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nStandard tonneau cover\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Sierra Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people. Interior features include:\n\n\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nEconomy gauge tracks driving style’s effect on efficiency\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable leather seats\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nGM’s two-mode hybrid system enables “full” hybrid operation with the capability to cruise on electric power up to 30 mph. The gas engine kicks in if more acceleration is needed, as well as at higher speeds; for maximum grunt, the electric motors and gas engine work together.\n\nAt the heart of the Sierra Hybrid is a 6.0-liter V-8 that teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two 60-kilowatt electric motors. The motors draw power from a 300-volt battery pack. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n332-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with 367 pounds-feet of torque and cylinder-deactivation technology\nUses regular gas\n26-gallon fuel tank\nTowing capacity of 6,100 pounds (rear-wheel drive) or 5,900 pounds (four-wheel drive)\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system and traction control\nSide curtain and front-seat side-impact airbags\nAvailable backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nGM says the Sierra 1500 Hybrid’s gasoline V-8 and electric motors team up for an overall mileage improvement compared with the regular Sierra. The Sierra Hybrid is available only as a rear- or four-wheel-drive crew cab, both with a 6.0-liter V-8 and two electric transmission motors. The pickup truck can seat up to six people. Standard features include a trailering package, locking rear differential and side curtain airbags.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Sierra 1500 Hybrid gets a new chrome three-bar grille for 2012, and there’s an available hard-drive-based navigation system with satellite radio and a USB port.\n\nExterior\nThere’s hybrid badging on the cab’s rear window, ahead of the side mirrors and on the tailgate, but otherwise the hybrid version looks similar to the gas-powered Sierra. Exterior features include:\n\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n18-inch chrome wheels\nStandard tonneau cover\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Sierra Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people. Interior features include:\n\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nGauge tracks optimal fuel economy\nAvailable leather seats\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nGM’s two-mode hybrid system enables “full” hybrid operation with the capability to cruise on electric power up to 30 mph. The gas engine kicks in if more acceleration is needed, as well as at higher speeds; for maximum grunt, the electric motors and gas engine work together.\n\nAt the heart of the Sierra Hybrid is a 6.0-liter V-8 that teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two 60-kilowatt electric motors. The motors draw power from a 300-volt battery pack, which recharges itself off the friction generated when you hit the brakes. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n332-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with 367 pounds-feet of torque and cylinder-deactivation technology\nUses regular gas\n26-gallon fuel tank\nTowing capacity of 6,100 pounds (rear-wheel drive) or 5,900 pounds (four-wheel drive)\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system and traction control\nSide curtain and front-seat side-impact airbags",

The Sierra Hybrid is only available as a rear- or four-wheel-drive crew cab, both with a 6.0-liter V-8 and two electric transmission motors. Standard features include a trailering package, locking rear differential and side curtain airbags.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe Sierra Hybrid gets GM’s OnStar 9.0 telematics system that GM says provides better voice recognition. GM also said they have worked to cut down on the amount of wind noise occupants hear.\n\nExterior\nThere’s hybrid badging on the cab’s rear window, ahead of the side mirrors and on the tailgate, but otherwise the hybrid version looks similar to the gas-powered version.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Silverado Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people. Interior features include:\n\n\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nFuel economy gauge\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nGM’s two-mode hybrid system enables “full” hybrid operation with the capability to cruise on electric power up to 30 mph. The gas engine kicks in if more acceleration is needed, as well as at higher speeds; for maximum grunt, the electric motors and gas engine work together.\n\nAt the heart of the Sierra Hybrid is a 6.0-liter V-8 that teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two 60-kilowatt electric motors. The motors draw power from a 300-volt battery pack, which recharges itself off the friction generated when you hit the brakes. The engine makes 332 horsepower and enables a towing capacity of 6,100 pounds with rear-wheel drive and 5,900 pounds with four-wheel drive. That’s  not as much as the regular Sierra’s 10,500-pound maximum towing capacity, but it’s not too shabby for a hybrid.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain and side-impact airbags",
