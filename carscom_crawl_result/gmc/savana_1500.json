      "expert_review": "Gaze into the GMC Savana’s four rows of seats and you get the idea that this baby is intended for more than family hauling, unless your family happens to have enough kids to flesh out a baseball team.\n\nGetting up into the Savana’s driver’s seat is quite a step, yet when you’re there it drives much like a standard minivan. Visibility out front is panoramic, but not so good out back. Its length makes it tricky in parking lots, and while parallel parking is not exactly a snap, I didn’t really have all that much trouble, either.\n\nUp front, the captain’s chairs are comfy, but around back the three rows of full-width seats are firm and do not tilt or adjust. They come out only with a wrench, instead of a quick-release, and that makes the Savana less versatile than smaller minivans. When a friend and I went biking, the only way to get our bikes inside was to slide them between the seats. This big van was wide enough and that was not a problem.\n\nThe speed-sensitive power steering was light enough for easy maneuvering in tight spots, yet retained decent road feel on the open road.\n\nOne advantage of the new design is a smaller “doghouse,” the nickname given to the box that covers the engine. In the old days the engine seriously intruded on legroom, but that is not so any more. In fact, it is easy to swivel out of the front seat and walk to the back.\n\nThe new dash has improved ergonomics, and all major controls fall easily within the driver’s reach. A large console with cupholders and glove box now sit under the dash.\n\nI noted that some of the switches and trim work looked more like a truck than a car, yet the overall level of fit and finish was similar to that of a minivan.\n\nThe swing-out rear doors open 165 degrees for easy loading. Thick door pillars, however, block rear vision and prevent installation of a rear wiper, which I missed in the rain. Learn to use the outside mirrors and forget about looking through the back door.\n\nEven with all seats in place there is a decent amount of space for luggage behind the fourth seat.\n\nBuilt in Wentzville, Mo., on 135- or 155-inch wheelbases, the Savana was all-new last year, including its name. It was formerly known as the Rally in the passenger configuration and Vandura for the base cargo model. The nose is rounded off, the taillights are mounted high in the aft door pillars and the interior is now on par with most other trucks. For 1997 dual airbags are available, as is speed-sensitive power steering, daytime running lights and\n\nrefined cooling and climate control systems.\n\nOften full-size vans wind up at conversion companies for transformation into rolling family rooms, or they are ordered stripped down for commercial use. Our van, however, was equipped with seats for 12 and all the creature comforts of a typical minivan.\n\nThere are three outlets for heating and air conditioning so rear-seat passengers will not smother or freeze.\n\nAltho ugh there are five different engine choices, the 5.7-liter Vortec V8 in our test unit is probably the best overall one. Its 245 horsepower was welcome when I accelerated up to highway speed, where it cruised quite pleasantly. The ride is firm, but not much rougher than a minivan. I never drove it with more than two persons on board.\n\nOther engine choices include a 4.3-liter V6, a 5.0-liter V8, a 7.4-liter V8 and 6.5-liter V8 turbodiesel.\n\nOutside of commercial use, vans such as the Savana have a very specific appeal. Folks who need this much space will appreciate how much more civilized the new model is compared to the last.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $24,860. It was equipped with power windows and locks, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, front and rear air conditioning, tinted glass, remote keyless entry, electric outside mirrors, six-way power driver’s seat and AM/FM stereo cassette with compact disc player.\n\nThe sticker price was $30, 0.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Big enough for a Little League team and nearly as comfortable as a family sedan, the Savana fills a niche for folks with big families or unusual hauling needs.\n\nCounterpoint: Vision to the rear is hindered by wide door pillars, and some switches were not well finished.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.7-liter V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 135 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,803 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $24,860\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $30,140\n\nMPG RATING: 13 city, 18 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMCs full-size van sells in fewer numbers than the similar Chevrolet Express but attracts a loyal clientele. Along with its full-size rivals from Dodge and Ford, the rear-drive truck-based van has been on the market for decades.\n\nLike Chevrolet, GMC produces both a cargo van and a passenger model, in two sizes and three capacity ratings: G1500 (half-ton), G2500 (three-quarter-ton) and G3500 (one-ton). Two regular trim levels are offered, the base SL and upscale SLE. General Motors and the Lear Corp. have been working together on a Savana SLT luxury van, which would be comparable to the new Chevrolet Express LT.\n\nBuilt on an extended, 155-inch wheelbase, the 2500/3500 vans can seat 12 to 15 occupants. A new 8.1-liter 8100 V-8 engine has replaced the 7400 V-8 for 2001. Otherwise, changes are primarily technical and are said to boost engine and transmission efficiency. Savana vans also are provided to conversion companies in unfinished form.\n\nExterior\nThe regular-length Savana rides a 135-inch wheelbase and measures 218.8 inches long, and extended-length models have a 155-inch wheelbase and stretch to 238.8 inches overall. These vans are considerably taller than minivans, ranging from 79.4 to 83.9 inches above the ground. With the seats removed, cargo volume is 267.3 cubic feet in the regular-length van or 316.8 cubic feet in the full-length model.\n\nTwo swing-out passenger-side doors can be replaced by a single sliding door, if desired. At the rear, two doors open a full 180 degrees to ease loading. The new SLT luxury van gets some distinctive exterior additions, as well as a fancier interior. Locks have been improved for 200l.\n\nInterior\nBase-model SL G1500 vans have vinyl high-back front buckets and a pair of rear bench seats for eight-passenger capacity. A dozen people fit into the G2500/3500 vans, seated on twin three-passenger benches in the middle two rows and a four-passenger bench in the way back. Seating for 15 is an option for the extended-length G3500 by adding another bench seat. Cargo vans come only with the two front bucket seats, and the passenger seat can also be removed. Cloth upholstery replaces vinyl in the SLE series, which also adds such extras as a tilt steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nA new family of radios operates with Radio Data Systems (RDS) technology, which permits the selection of stations by program type and even the possibility of traffic and weather reports.\n\nSpecial features on the new SLT luxury van include two 6.8-inch flip-down video screens for family entertainment, independent audio controls in each row, Bose 12-speaker premium sound and two wireless headphones. The exterior of this upscale model gets specific body-color components.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGeneral Motors offers a selection of five engines to accommodate a variety of cargo- and passenger-hauling requirements. Choices begin with a 200-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 for the G1500 van. Depending on the model, a 220-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 or a 255-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 are the standard powerplants for G2500/3500 vans. Options for heavy-duty models include a new 340-hp, 8.1-liter Vortec 8100 V-8, replacing the 7400 engine. GMC claims that the new 8100 engine is more economical than its predecessor. A 195-hp, 6.5-liter diesel V-8 also is available.\n\nAll models have a four-speed-automatic transmission. When properly equipped, a G1500 van can tow as much as 7,300 pounds, while the G3500 diesel can pull as much as 10,000 pounds. This years engines have a new powertrain control module and a more efficient alternator, and automatic transmissions for heavier-duty models have received some internal enhancements.\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA near-twin to the Chevrolet Express, the full-size rear-wheel-drive Savana van comes in two sizes and two versions: regular- and extended-length, and passenger and cargo. The Savana and the other truck-based, RWD, full-size vans available today have been on the market for decades.\n\nFor 2002, more equipment comes in preferred groups. There are fewer freestanding options available, and gasoline engines have gained a more efficient starter.\n\nLike Chevrolet, GMC manufactures vans in three capacity ratings: G1500 (half-ton), G2500 (three-quarter-ton) and G3500 (one-ton). Two regular trim levels are offered: the base SL and the upscale SLE. General Motors and the Lear Corp. worked together to create a third version, the Savana SLT luxury van, which is comparable to Chevrolets Express LT.\n\nSales of both the Savana and the Express declined in 2001, though Chevrolets version sells in considerably greater numbers. The Savana slipped from 42,391 units in 2000 to 36,674 vans in 2001, according to Automotive News. When Dodges full-size Ram Van begins to fade out of the market in mid-2003, GMC and Chevrolet could see some sales increases. As a rule, full-size van buyers are loyal, sticking with the same make for each purchase.\n\nBuilt on an extended, 155-inch wheelbase, the G2500/G3500 wagons can seat 12 to 15 occupants, depending on the seating configuration. Many of these vans go to conversion companies, in unfinished form, for transformation into special vehicles for the differently abled or lavishly equipped virtual living rooms on wheels.\n\nExterior\nRegular-length Savana vans ride a 135-inch wheelbase and measure 218.8 inches long overall, while extended-length models have a 155-inch wheelbase and stretch to 238.8 inches long overall. The full-size Savana is considerably taller than minivans, standing 79.6 to 83.9 inches high.\n\nTwo swing-out passenger-side doors are standard, but they can be replaced with a single sliding door. The two doors at the rear open a full 180 degrees to ease loading. In addition to some distinctive body-colored exterior additions, the SLT luxury van gets a fancier interior.\n\nInterior\nThe base SL G1500 offers eight-passenger capacity and contains vinyl high-back front buckets and a pair of rear bench seats. A dozen people can fit into the G2500/G3500 vans; those passengers will be seated on twin three-passenger benches in the middle two rows and a four-passenger bench all the way in the back. Seating for 15 occupants in the extended-length G3500 is attained by adding another optional bench seat.\n\nThe cargo van comes only with the two front bucket seats. To gain even more interior space, the passenger seat can also be removed.\n\nCloth upholstery replaces vinyl in the SLE series, which also adds such extras as a tilt steering wheel and cruise control. Special features in the SLT luxury van include two 6.8-inch flip-down video screens for family entertainment, independent audio controls in each row, a 12-speaker Bose premium sound system and two wireless headphones.\n\nStereo systems are available with Radio Data Systems (RDS) technology. This technology permits the selection of stations according to program type and may allow the reception of traffic and weather reports. With all rear seats removed, cargo volume is 267.3 cubic feet in the regular-length van or 316.8 cubic feet in the full-length model.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTo accommodate a variety of cargo- and passenger-carrying requirements, five different engines are available in the Savana models. A 200-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 goes into the G1500 van. Depending on the exact model, either a 220-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 or a 255-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 is standard for the G2500/G3500 vans. Optional engines for the heavy-duty models include a 340-hp, 8.1-liter Vortec 8100 gasoline V-8 and a 195-hp, 6.5-liter diesel V-8.\n\nA four-speed-automatic transmission is used in all models. When properly equipped, the G1500 van can tow as much as 6,600 pounds, while the G3500 diesel can pull as much as 10,000 pounds. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor the 2003 model year, GMC redesigned its full-size rear-wheel-drive vans for the first time in seven years. The 2003 Savanas got upgraded powertrains, fresh features and an updated appearance. Three industry firsts in full-size vans were available: all-wheel drive, an optional left-side door and unique side access panels for use on commercial vans. Front-end styling was revised to give the Savana a greater family resemblance to other General Motors trucks.\n\nGM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system has been added to 15-passenger models for 2004. Chevrolet’s Express is closely related to the Savana and sells far better.\n\nGMC uses the H-Series designation for vans with full-time all-wheel drive, while two-wheel-drive models make up the G-Series. All-wheel-drive vans are equipped with a viscous-coupled transfer case and function on both wet and dry pavement without driver intervention.\n\nGM’s line of Gen III V-8 engines is available: a 275-horsepower Vortec 4800, a 285-hp Vortec 5300 and a 300-hp Vortec 6000. The base engine in light-duty G-Series vans is a 4.3-liter V-6.\n\nExterior\nAs part of last year’s redesign, the Savana’s front end gained a new grille, bumper, fascia, hood and fenders. Upscale reflector-type headlights were installed, and the taillamps were revamped.\n\nLight-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering, which promises greater agility. Front and rear suspensions are modified from those used on GM’s full-size pickup trucks. The rear suspensions use a solid axle with semielliptic variable-rate multileaf springs and gas shocks. The tires measure 16 inches in diameter, and the fuel tanks are made of composite material.\n\nPassenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. The regular-length model has a 135-inch wheelbase and measures 224.1 inches long overall, while the extended-length van is equipped with a 155-inch wheelbase and stretches 244.1 inches long overall. These vans are 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nRegular-length passenger and Cargo Vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. The side access doors feature remote releases and are limited to work-oriented models. They permit easier accessibility to tools and parts from either side of the van.\n\nGMC’s 1500 Series vans have gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWRs) of 6,200 or 7,200 pounds (for passenger and cargo models, respectively), while the 2500 Series vans have GVWRs of 7,300 or 8,500 pounds. Full-bodied 3500 Series vans are rated at 9,600 pounds GVWR.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo Vans seat only two people. Both Radio Data System (RDS) technology and GM’s OnStar communication system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine in light-duty, rear-drive G-Series vans is a 195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6. Three V-8s are available: a 275-hp 4.8-liter, a 285-hp 5.3-liter and a 300-hp 6.0-liter. Each engine mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.",
