      "expert_review": "I figured Fred was crazy. He’s an East Coast spokesman for General Motors Corp.’s GMC Truck Division. He has lots of wacky ideas. Like: “Hey, I’m sending the biggest, baddest GMC van down to the D.C. area. Seats eight people. You oughtta see how it runs in the city.”\n\nI mumbled a reply and hung up the phone — and forgot about Fred, until the van arrived.\n\nIt was the 1997 GMC Savana SLE, a gigantic, “Madrid red” thing sitting on a 135-inch wheelbase and stretching an overall length of 218.8 inches — or 18.23 feet, to put it in perspective.\n\nThe darned thing stood 80.7 inches high, enough to cast a long shadow in a setting sun, and it was almost as wide as it was tall at 79.2 inches. And, oh, it had a phalanx of deep-tinted passenger windows on either side, which gave it the look of a prisoner transport or Secret Service vehicle. It was hard to tell. But it certainly didn’t look friendly.\n\nFred’s people parked the van in front of my house, which raised some neighborly eyebrows.\n\n“What is it?” one neighbor asked.\n\n“It’s a GMC van,” I said.\n\n“Kinda big for a van, don’tcha think?,” the neighbor asked.\n\n“It’ a full-size van,” I said, marveling over how the term “van”has come to mean “minivan” in the minds of many people.\n\n“Full-size?” asked the neighbor. “Well,” he said. “It’s reeeeeally big.”\n\nBackground: The Savana is the scion of the old GMC Rally/Vanduravans, whose sales ended in 1995.\n\nThe Rally/Vandura models were galumptious workhorses, used mostly to haul goods and people — for a fee. There wasn’t much sophisticated about the Rally/Vanduras. They were just big ol’ trucks with tall walls and ceilings. And if you owned or operated one long enough, you came to expect scratches, dents and various ping marks as being part of the van’s design.\n\nBut with the Savana, introduced in 1996, GMC is trying to soften that image without undermining the big van’s work ethic.\n\nStepping inside the test model, for example, was like entering a room at the Holiday Inn. Patterned fabric on the seats and side panels blended with plush carpeting on the floor.\n\nBut Fred was wrong about one thing: The test model was neither the “biggest” nor the “baddest” of the available GMC Savana vans. That honor goes to the 155-inch-wheelbase model, which stretches an overall length of 238.8 inches (19.9 feet!) and can seat up to 15 people.\n\nSavana models include the tested G1500 (half-ton); G2500 (three-quarter ton) and G3500 (one-ton). Two trim packages are available, the base SL and upscale SLE.\n\nThere are engines aplenty to run those monsters: a 4.3-liter, 200-horsepower gasoline V-6; a 5-liter, 230-horsepower gasoline V-8; a 5.7-liter, 250-horsepower gasoline V-8; a 7.4-liter, 290-horsepower gasoline V-8; and a 6.5-liter, 190-horsepower turbo-diesel V-8.\n\nThe test truck was equipped with the 5-liter V-8, rated 230-horsepower at 4,600 rpm, with torque rated 285 pound-feet at 2,800 rpm.\n\nAn electronically controlled, fo ur-speed automatic transmission is standard in all Savana models, with the bigger trucks getting heavy-duty versions of that gearbox.\n\nThe standard equipment list is long, including: dual front air bags; side-door guard beams; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; power windows and locks (in the SLE trim package); halogen headlamps; eight-passenger seating; and 15-inch steel wheels (on the G1500 truck).\n\nThe G1500 model can be equipped to pull up to 6,000 pounds; the G2500 up to 8,000 lbs. trailer weight, and the G2500 up to 10,000 lbs.\n\nGMC SAVANA SLE\n\nComplaint: Some long-legged people said the rear seats were too low for their personal comfort. Also, trying to garage a full-size Savana in the city requires a combination of diplomatic skills and bribery.\n\nPraise: The interior roominess of it all, and the surprising ease with which this big van moves in highway traffic.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The test model obstructed views more than it turned heads.\n\nRide, ac eleration and handling: Front and middle-seaters gave ride high marks. Back-seaters grumbled. Acceleration was boffo! This is one, big, fast truck! Handling, with healthy helpings of common sense, was excellent. Excellent braking, considering the size of what the brakes had to stop.\n\nMileage: About 13 miles per gallon (31-gallon tank, estimated 393-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), carrying up to five occupants, running mostly highway with light cargo.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with console-mounted, single-disc CD player. By Delco. Decent. No big deal.\n\nPrice: Base price is $24,860. Dealer’s invoice price is $21,752.50. Price as tested is $27,860, including $3,000 in options (optional rear air conditioning, dual electric rearview mirrors, leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, six-way power driver and passenger seats, and compact disc player) and a $615 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A good value, if you want a big van. Compare with similar offerings from Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. No foreign automaker sells giant passenger vans in the United States.",

      "expert_review": "Way back when even the Rolling Stones were young, conversion vans were simple and usually homemade.\n\nWith a thick swath of shag carpeting, some wood paneling, eight-track tape deck and maybe a black light, you had yourself a party van. Chevys, Fords, Dodges and, of course, VW microbuses made up most of the fleet of panel trucks given the full-on hippie treatment. The funkier, the better.\n\nNo more. The conversion-van industry is big business with most of its luxurious products going to families who appreciate the roomy accommodations.\n\nBut conversion-van sales faded over the past decade when full-size luxury sport utility vehicles moved into the territory, providing similar amenities, as well as a trendiness that has slipped away from the big vans.\n\nGeneral Motors recently began a push to revive flagging sales of conversion vans, organizing 2,000 Chevrolet and GMC dealerships and 24 conversion companies, known as “upfitters,” to sell van conversions directly through the dealers.\n\nCustomers can walk into one of the dealerships and order Chevy Express or GMC Savana vans that can be converted with a variety of treatments from a variety of upfitters.\n\nThe test truck was a 2005 GMC Savana outfitted by an Alabama company called Southern Comfort. This bulky behemoth, with its towering “high-top” roof and lush interior, proved easy to drive and highly appreciated by passengers, especially with its 22-inch, high-definition TV.\n\nWith gas prices soaring, the timing may be questionable for a full-size conversion-van push. But for such luxury rides, big is still beautiful.\n\n– – –\n\nThe lowdown\n\nPERFORMANCE: The huge V-8 provides plenty of pickup for the Savana conversion van, which weighs more than 3 tons. Naturally, gas mileage is problematic; I got about 13 miles per gallon in a mix of city and highway driving.\n\nDRIVABILITY: For a great big box of a truck, more than 8 feet tall and 18 feet long, the Savana drives relatively well, as long as you keep its bulk in mind. advertisement\n\nA steady diet of driving this giant might get old fast, especially in such places as parking lots, even though the steering and brakes are responsive and the handling feels stable.\n\nOn the highway, the mighty van cruises along nicely with just a hint of wind roar.\n\nSTYLING: Good-looking lower-body trim and 20-inch chrome wheels add a cool custom look to the Southern Comfort van.\n\nINTERIOR: Here’s what the conversion van is all about: comfort, roominess and loads of features. Custom leather seats and wood trim, as well as a softly lit disco ceiling inside the raised roof, help the van feel rich and exclusive, almost like a private jet. Lots of room to move around, which can help make long drives less grueling.\n\nThe big high-definition TV screen with theater surround sound, DVD player and video-game inputs, plus high-end audio system should make any trip entertaining, especially for kids. The rear-seat folds automatically into a bed.\n\nThe audio system for the driver and front passenger is separate from the rear TV/audio system. Wireless headphones are supplied for the movie watchers and stereo listeners in back.\n\nTwo complaints: Despite the van’s size and roominess, the driver’s seat is cramped for legroom and elbow room, and the pleated curtains over the windows proved flimsy.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: With many luxury vehicles breaking the $50,000 mark, this high-end cruiser is well-priced at $56,205, including about $26,000 in conversion upgrades. Now, if only gas prices would settle down.\n\nRelated:\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, full-size van, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 6-liter V-8, 345 horsepower at 4,200 rpm, 380 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 135 inches.\n\nOverall length: 224 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,258 pounds (van only, without conversion extras).\n\nTowing capacity: 6,600 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: NA (13 mpg observed).\n\nHighs: Roominess, luxury features, good drivability.\n\nLows: Cramped driver’s seat, curtain issues, fuel mileage.\n\n– – –\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $30,210.\n\nPrice as tested: $56,205.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Southern Comfort conversion, including high-top roof; 22-inch high-definition TV, with theater sound, DVD and game inputs; four wireless headphones; rear audio; rear-seat bed; leather seats; 20-inch chrome wheels; lower-body trim; custom dashboard; billet grille; pleated shades; and backup radar, $25,995.\n\n– – –\n\nFor more on the GMC Savana conversion van, go to autos.azcentral.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2008, a tire pressure monitoring system is standard on GMC’s full-size van, and passenger van models get standard side curtain airbags. Driver controls have been redesigned, too: new equipment includes the steering wheel, gauges, ventilation system controls, stereo and cloth seats. Competitors include the Dodge Sprinter and Ford E-Series.\n\nExterior\nThe Savana’s front end has a trapezoidal grille with a large GMC badge and upscale reflector headlights.\n\nLight-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering, which promises greater agility. The rear suspensions use a solid axle with multileaf springs and gas shocks. All Savanas have 16-inch wheels.\n\nPassenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. The regular-length model has a 135-inch wheelbase and measures 224.1 inches long overall, while the extended-length van rides on a 155-inch wheelbase and stretches 244.1 inches long overall. Each of these vans is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nRegular-length passenger and cargo vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. Available side access panels feature remote releases and are limited to work-oriented models. They permit easier accessibility to tools and parts from either side of the van.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo vans seat a maximum of two people.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Savana can be equipped with one of five engines: a 195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6; a 279-hp (maximum), 4.8-liter V-8; a 301-hp, 5.3-liter V-8; a 323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8; or a 250-hp, 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8 that generates 460 pounds-feet of torque. Each engine teams with a four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a tow/haul mode. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. For 2008, passenger van models get standard side curtain airbags.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC redesigned its full-size vans for the first time in seven years for the 2003 model year. The 2003 Savanas got upgraded powertrains, fresh features and an updated appearance. Three industry firsts in full-size vans were available: all-wheel drive, an optional left-side door and unique side access panels for use on commercial vans. For 2006, GMC now offers a 250-horsepower, 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8 on the G2500 and G3500 cargo models.\n\nExterior\nAs part of the 2003 redesign, the Savana’s front end gained a new grille, bumper, fascia, hood and fenders. Upscale reflector-type headlights were installed, and the taillamps were revamped.\n\nLight-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering, which promises greater agility. Front and rear suspensions are modified from those used on General Motors’ full-size pickup trucks. The rear suspensions use a solid axle with multileaf springs and gas shocks. All Savanas have 16-inch wheels.\n\nPassenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. The regular-length model has a 135-inch wheelbase and measures 224.1 inches long overall, while the extended-length van rides on a 155-inch wheelbase and stretches 244.1 inches long overall. Each of these vans is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nRegular-length passenger and Cargo Vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. The side access panels feature remote releases and are limited to work-oriented models. They permit easier accessibility to tools and parts from either side of the van.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo Vans seat a maximum of two people. Both Radio Data System technology and GM’s OnStar communication system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Savana can be equipped with one of five engines: a 195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6; a 285-hp, 4.8-liter V-8; a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8; a 345-hp, 6.0-liter V-8; or a 250-hp, 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8. Each engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a tow/haul mode. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe only significant change on GMC’s van for 2007 is that the 5.3-liter V-8 engine is now standard on 1500 passenger van models. That V-8 can be ordered with flex-fuel capability. A 4.3-liter V-6 is available on 1500 conversion vans.\n\nGMC redesigned its full-size vans for the first time in seven years for the 2003 model year. The 2003 Savanas got upgraded powertrains, fresh features and an updated appearance. Three industry firsts in full-size vans were available: all-wheel drive, an optional left-side door and unique side access panels for use on commercial vans. GMC offers a 250-horsepower, 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8 on the G2500 and G3500 cargo models.\n\nExterior\nAs part of the 2003 redesign, the Savana’s front end gained a new grille, bumper, fascia, hood and fenders. Upscale reflector headlights were installed, and the taillamps were revamped.\n\nLight-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering, which promises greater agility. Front and rear suspensions are modified from those used on General Motors’ full-size pickup trucks. The rear suspensions use a solid axle with multileaf springs and gas shocks. All Savanas have 16-inch wheels.\n\nPassenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. The regular-length model has a 135-inch wheelbase and measures 224.1 inches long overall, while the extended-length van rides on a 155-inch wheelbase and stretches 244.1 inches long overall. Each of these vans is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nRegular-length passenger and cargo vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. The side access panels feature remote releases and are limited to work-oriented models. They permit easier accessibility to tools and parts from either side of the van.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo vans seat a maximum of two people.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Savana can be equipped with one of five engines: a 195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6; a 285-hp, 4.8-liter V-8; a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8; a 345-hp, 6.0-liter V-8; or a 250-hp, 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8. Each engine teams with a four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a tow/haul mode. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system are standard on passenger models. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Savana is available in quarter-ton, half-ton and one-ton weight classes, in regular- and long-wheelbase form, with five engine choices. These variations come in four different van models: cargo, 15-seat passenger, conversion and cutaway. Competitors include the Dodge Sprinter and Ford E-Series.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe 2010 GMC Savana gains three flex-fuel engines. Savana 2500 and 3500 models also receive a new six-speed automatic transmission and revised rear axles.\n\nExterior\nThe Savana’s front end has a trapezoidal grille with a large GMC badge and upscale reflector headlights. Passenger vans come in regular and extended lengths. Regular-length passenger and cargo vans can be fitted with a 60/40-split left-side entry and loading door. Side access panels, which offer access to either side of the van, feature remote releases and are available on work-oriented models. The regular-length Savana G1500 measures 224 inches long overall, while the G3500 extended-length van rides on a stretched, 244-inch body. The regular-length Savana is almost 10 inches longer than the E-Series and almost 10 inches shorter than the Sprinter. All Savanas are 79.4 inches wide, which is about the same as the E-Series and Sprinter.\n\nStandard 17-inch steel wheels on G1500 and H1500, with 16-inch steel wheels on the 2500 and 3500\nOptional 17-inch aluminum wheels on G1500 and H1500\nChrome Appearance Package offers front/rear chrome bumpers and grille, with dual composite halogen headlamps\n\nInterior\nDepending on the configuration, Savana passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants. Cargo vans seat a maximum of two people. The Savana’s maximum interior cargo volume (on the cargo model) is 225.1 cubic feet for regular-length models and 261.6 cubic feet in extended-length vans. That’s about the same cargo capacity as the E-Series, but pales in comparison with the Sprinter’s 318 cubic feet of interior volume.\n\nAvailable new remote vehicle start\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard vinyl seats\nOptional cloth seats\nAvailable power locks and windows, tilting steering wheel and cruise control\n\nUnder the Hood\nLight-duty G1500 vans have rack-and-pinion steering, while G2500 and G3500 vans have integral power steering. The rear suspensions use a semifloating axle with multi leaf springs and gas shocks. The Savana can be equipped with one of five engines. Rear- and all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n250-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\nFast idle option on 6.0-liter V-8 allows heavy-duty accessory usage at idle\nQuieter alternator\nNew six-speed automatic transmission for 2500 and 3500 models\n\nSafety\nThe Savana received a host of safety upgrades for 2008, including side curtain airbags for the first three rows of passenger models. Also, 12- and 15-passenger models have three-layer glass that helps reduce the risk of ejection during an accident. Additional standard safety features include:\n\nDriver and front-passenger airbags\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability control (on passenger models)",
