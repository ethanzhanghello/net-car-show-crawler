      "expert_review": "SOMEWHERE amidst the rocks and snow of the Shenandoah Valley, Gerry became a believer. Gerry the Toyota Man, Mr. Anything-but-an-American-Ride Gerry, the dude who once bought a dinky Volkswagen pickup when he couldn’t get the Japanese model he wanted, that Gerry fell in love with a Made-in-Indiana, We-Be-American, 1992 GMC Sierra 4×4 truck!\n\nGerry’s one of those brothers who always runs his mouth about how Americans in general and General Motors in particular can’t make anything right. He can quote chapter and verse of Consumer Reports and can recite a litany of automotive woes from everyone he knows who has ever owned an American car or truck, and he swears that he knows legions of mechanics who won’t go near anything with a GM nameplate.\n\nFor years, I’ve been telling Gerry that he’s full of it — largely because I drive lots of vehicles from lots of manufacturers, and know for a fact that no company, foreign or domestic, makes stuff as bad as its critics claim, nor as good as its advertisements proclaim.\n\nSo I invited Gerry to zip up his lips and take a trip with me out to the Shenandoah Valley, where we found some snow-covered, rock-strewn paths for a bit of off-roading in the Sierra 4×4. We bounced around for a couple of hours, hit what we assumed to be several ditches, sideswiped a few fallen tree limbs and generally had a good time.\n\nGerry didn’t say much. But what he did say was interesting: “{Expletive}, man! I could buy one of these.”\n\nBackground: GM rolled out its first full-size pickup in 1917. It has long been a leader in that market segment, although it sometimes has had to suck the dust of Ford Motor Co., maker of the famed F-series pickups. Chrysler Corp., too, has done well with full-size trucks. Heck, trucks have helped to keep Chrysler rolling when seemingly everything else was going wrong at the company.\n\nFull-size pickups, in fact, are where the Big Three still hold some supremacy over their Japanese rivals. But that position won’t go unchallenged much longer. Toyota, despite corporate disclaimers, is working hard to introduce full-size trucks in the U.S. market. And if Toyota makes that move, others will follow.\n\nBut here’s betting that any Japanese foray into the full-size pickup market will not be as successful as Japan’s move into car sales — not as long as GM continues turning out trucks as good as the Sierra 4×4.\n\nComplaints: At night, the illuminated instrument panel creates a disturbing glare on the rear window. But regular truck drivers call that a wimp’s complaint. Wimp or not, I don’t like it. Also, it makes little sense to me to do a super-duper job painting a truck bed that’s going to get scratched up, dented and abused by all of the things that work trucks, like the Sierra 4×4, carry. A bedliner ought to be made standard on these things.\n\nPraise: Totally solid construction. Not even Gerry could find a fit-and-finish flaw. Terrific o ff-road manners, thanks to the optional Z-71 off-road package, which includes heavy-duty springs and shocks. Excellent legroom, headroom and on-road driving manners. Easy-to-use four-wheel-drive transfer case.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Sierra proves that pretty does not necessarily mean dainty.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Superior acceleration. No wonder: The test Sierra 4×4 was equipped with an optional 5.7-liter V-8, electronically fuel-injected engine rated 210 horsepower at 4,000 rpm. A total beast! The standard engine is a 4.3-liter V-6 rated 160 horsepower at 4,000 rpm, which is not exactly tame. Braking (power-assisted front discs and rear drums) is excellent. Rear anti-locks are standard.\n\nThe tested Sierra 4×4 can carry up to 1,884 pounds and pull a trailer load of 7,500 pounds.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette by GM/Delco. Excellent.\n\nMileage: About 16 miles per gallon (34-gallon tank, about 530-mile rang on usable volume of 87-octane unleaded), combined city, highway and off-road, two occupants and light cargo.\n\nPrice: Base price is $15,583. Dealer’s invoice price is $13,526. Price as tested is $21,529, including $5,351 in options and a $595 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Sierra 4×4 is a darned good truck even without the options. Save money. Scrap ’em. Compare with Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram 150.",

      "expert_review": "Let’s get the formalities out of the way first, then get to the one glaringfault the full-size GMC Sierra pickup truck is saddled with–a problem thatmust be resolved. Soon.\n\nThe 1997 Sierra 4WD extended cab pickup we tested rides and handles morelike a car than a pickup. Smooth and quiet with minimal jostling when the roadis uneven. More than ample space inside to stretch feet or legs and wiggle thehead, if you so choose. As much room and comfort as your family sedan, onlybeing an extended cab with seats for the kids, it’s a family truck.\n\nBeing an extended cab, there’s a large bench seat in back to place visitorsor packages, and with the optional ($420) rear-access (some call it third)door on the passenger side, it’s very easy to slip into or out of coach whileMom and Dad enjoy first-class upfront.\n\nThe 5.7-liter V-8 has plenty of power though the 13-mile-per-galloncity/17-m.p.g. highway rating clearly indicates there’s a price to pay for anyand all energy boosts. Thank goodness the fuel tank holds 25 gallons, you’llneed each and every one of them.\n\nThe optional ($225) bed liner keeps the metal from being scratched whileserving as a sound deadener when you carry items in back.\n\nWith 4WD the Sierra will go anywhere, anytime, and with an electronic shifttransfer case, all you do is push a button on the dash to engage all thewheels. A no-brainer.\n\nIf an infant or child is in the front seat rather than in the back, whereinfants and children belong (belted, of course, as with any adults travelingwith you), you only need place the ignition key in the switch on the dash,give it a turn and deactivate the bag so it won’t deploy in a collision.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem with Sierra. Passenger-side air-bagdeactivation is supposed to be a cure-all for the problem of an infant orchild being in the direct path of a deploying air bag.\n\nThe folks at GMC are to be complimented for adding two bags to Sierra (samevehicle as the full-size Chevrolet C/K pickup). The compact GMC Jimmy (ChevyBlazer) doesn’t get dual air bags until the 1998 model year, starting thisfall. But GMC interior designers should be ordered back to the drawing boardfor that air-bag deactivation switch.\n\nThe problem: You can’t always see the switch or the light on the switchthat tells whether the bag is activated because the switch is in theinstrument panel, behind the steering wheel, which blocks the view.\n\nAlso, the system is designed so that whatever mode you left the bag on yourlast trip–on or off–that’s the mode the bag stays in the next time you getin and drive away.\n\nDeactivation switches are supposed to protect infants and small kids fromthe potential problems of air bags making contact with undeveloped heads andnecks. But if you can’t see the switch and the light, you’re asking fortrouble.\n\nYou don’t want to have to ask, “Did I or didn’t I?” while traveling at 60miles per hour. And you don’t want to have to duck your head and peer aroundthe wheel to spot the light, either.\n\nPerhaps those insisting that deactivation switches are the answer don’tunderstand the problem. In an attempt to solve one problem, they’ve createdanother.\n\nToo bad, because GM’s dealer consolidation plan that merged GMC and Pontiacis getting GMC and its products the recognition they deserve.\n\nUsed to be that to find a GMC store, you needed a road map and a lunchbox–the map to find the store, the lunch box to tide you over until youreached the store hidden in the boonies.\n\nAt least 65 percent of all GMC stores are combined with Pontiac facilities,making them easier to find and use. And it helps that a GM division withoutits own pickup truck or sport-utility vehicle can display a full product lineby pointing at the GMC entries. So we admit that GM marketing guru RonZarrella, who pressed for the consolidation, h as had at least one good ideasince joining the GM fold.\n\nThe Sierra SLT extended cab with 4WD we tested starts at $20,896. Itdoesn’t take much to option it up to $30,000.\n\nOne non-traditional item that’s standard is a video that explains howanti-lock brakes work. It’s must viewing for the entire family in that itexplains what ABS does and doesn’t do and enlightens you to the sound(chatter) and feel (pedal pulsation) of ABS so you aren’t surprised when youencounter it.

      "expert_review": "At Pontiac-GMC Division, the deuce is wild. And at GMC’s end of the business, its Sierra full-sized pickup show truck is a wild Deuce.\n\nIn today’s sportside pickup game, the GMC Sierra Deuce can be used for anything, work, fun, image, or whatever fits your personal desire.\n\nAs a full-sized pickup truck, GMC has built the Deuce to give the public a peek at what lies in the future in the way of product form.\n\nUnlike a lot of show vehicles, the Sierra Deuce is a real operating truck that embraces a coupe expression in a pickup, while retaining the functionality of a truck.\n\nThe Deuce name comes from the pickup having a coupe configuration with a center console. I’m not sure that is ever going to see the light of day on a truck production line. Maybe, however, as an option.\n\nThere is a lot about this vehicle that will see production. Power, size, and a styling heritage that dwells back into the history of General Motors are the hallmarks of the Deuce.\n\nThe pickup benefits from GM’s ever ongoing efforts in research and development.\n\nThe front end is a prime example of the pickup’s styling character.\n\nIt employs a lamp configuration that is deeper, wider, and taller than those used on previous Sierra sportside pickups.\n\nIn addition, lighting engineers have created a new lens for accurate low beam focusing, and reflector optics for superior high beam illumination.\n\nBoth modes produce a highway-friendly lighting pattern that provides a 30 percent increase in forward lighting range.\n\nThe low beams of the headlights yield 120 percent more left-hand driving light for better left-side visibility. The high beams have 25 percent more illumination than previous Sierra headlights.\n\nFront end styling is accentuated by a wide grille that denotes the Deuce’s on-road stance and is designed to increase underhood air flow.\n\nFor a bit of show biz, the chrome-accented bumper and chrome-plated tow hooks are designed to attract buyers of full- sized pickup.\n\nBack end styling features custom dual exhaust tips, body-colored aero cladding, and a unique treatment of the rear fascia. The fascia contains a custom roll pan, and large, round backup lights on each side of the license plate well.\n\nFunctional facets of the rear of the truck lie in rear fender/body panels made of a durable RRIM (reinforced reaction injection molding) polymer. The rustproof panel paints like steel but is lighter and more heat tolerant.\n\nFor easier access to the cargo bed, integral side steps are molded into the panel.\n\nInterior-wise, appointments are designed for function as well as comfort.\n\nAmenities include suede-accented seats, with hip room being 1.3 inches greater than that of the current Sierra. The seat track is 34 percent longer to accommodate drivers of all sizes, and you can look for that in the future.\n\nInstrumentation consists of a user-friendly instrument cluster that monitors 19 functions, has an electronic odometer with trip meter, and an engine hour meter.\n\nDriver’ s will be interested in the frame, which has new dimensional specifications that improve ride quality and stability over the current generation Sierra.\n\nThe wheelbase is extended two inches to 119.5 inches. The rear track is widened 2.5 inches, the front track nine-tenths of an inch. Overall length is 203.3 inches.\n\nStructurally the frame is stronger, stiffer, and lighter than the present Sierra.\n\nBy hydroforming the front rail section, metal fit, dimensional control of brackets, crush performance and serviceability has been improved.\n\nWhile the frame is the backbone of the Deuce, it’s new generation Vortec 5300 Series V-8 is the guts. The 5.3-liter engine produces 265-horsepower and 320 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nWhen coupled to a four- speed automatic that has a Tow/Haul mode, and standing on 18-inch wheels, the Deuce is in the heavy hauler category.\n\nThis really comes into play via GMC’s AutoTrac active transfer case that can automatically transfer power to the front wheels when slippage occurs at the rear wheels.\n\nThe Deuce has a sibling in a truck called the Sierra ACE, an extended cab version of the pickup.\n\nThe vehicles are forerunners of what GMC has in mind for the next century.",

      "expert_review": "Although General Motors’ full-size pickups lag behind Ford’s new F-150 and the Dodge Ram in some areas, they’re up to the minute in one key respect.\n\nThanks to a new third-door option, the usefulness of rear seat space in Chevy and GMC extended-cab models improves by a bunch, making that space accessible to almost anyone. It’s no longer a realm restricted to gymnasts and contortionists.\n\nSure, all truck manufacturers have tried to make rear seats more accessible by making front seats slide forward more easily.\n\nBut that extra door — a $420 option on our loaded GMC Sierra Club Coupe 4×4 — lends a measure of civilization that takes pickups another evolutionary step forward.\n\nWhile sport-utility vehicles are in the limelight these days, pickups have been quietly but steadily moving closer to the mainstream as everyday transportation.\n\nAdding a back door makes them more convenient for people who need them to haul kids, dogs and groceries inside as well as lumber, hay bales and sofas in the cargo bed.\n\nWe’re not forgetting the four-door crew cab pickup here. But crew cabs are only slightly shorter than aircraft carriers and only slightly handier in traffic. That’s why their popularity is confined almost exclusively to construction crews and racing teams.\n\nGM certainly isn’t alone in offering the third-door feature. It’s standard equipment on extended-cab versions of the new Ford F-150.\n\nBut GM was the first to announce a third-door pickup. Moreover, GM is the only manufacturer offering a third door option on its compact pickup line.\n\nWhen you order an extra door on extended-cab versions of the Chevy S-Series and GMC Sonoma, it’s on the driver’s side, rather than the passenger’s, but the net effect is the same — easier access.\n\nIncidentally, there’s an interesting semantic footnote to the development of the GM third door.\n\nAlthough an extra door makes getting people and stuff into the rear of an extended cab easier, don’t expect living room space once you’ve eased yourself inside.\n\nRear seat legroom in all full-size extended-cab pickups is about the same as you’d get in a subcompact sedan.\n\nMost manufacturers rate extended-cab passenger capacity at five or six, depending on whether the front has a bench seat or twin buckets.\n\nBut if your passengers in the rear seat are taller than, say, 5-foot-5, there’s really only room back there for two.\n\nOn the other hand, when you’re not accommodating people there’s a lot of room for things you’d rather not leave in the cargo bed, like power tools. And it’s a lot easier to get those things in and out.\n\nAside from the absence of an air bag for the front passenger, the interior of our Sierra test truck provided an excellent index of just how livable pickup trucks have become.\n\nIn addition to the roominess that goes with an extended cab, this truck was well equipped with air conditioning, a very good AM/FM/CD/cassette sound system, power windows and locks, tilt steering, cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. That was all part of a $3,454 comfort-convenience package.\n\nThe 60-40 split bench seat provided plenty of room to squirm around in extended driving, which helped to offset its so-so contours. There were also plenty of places to stow small stuff, including a fold-down center console that doubles as a seat back when three are riding up front.\n\nGM’s cup-holder team — a key part for any manufacturer’s design staff these days — did an exceptionally nifty job in the General’s full-size pickups. The holders pop out of the upper-right portion of the dashboard above the climate and audio buttons and dials, but don’t interfere with any of them. Nice.\n\nAnother contemporary feature in our test truck was electronic engagement for the four-wheel-drive system, a $123 option. No wrestling with a separate s fter for the transfer case. Just push a button and you’re ready for gooey going.\n\nEven with the third-door option, GM’s big trucks are beginning to show their years in a couple of areas.\n\nThe first is styling. Although pickup truck design ages slowly, the Chevy and GMC C/K have been upstaged by the macho presence of the Ram and the smooth-but-tough looks of the new F-150.\n\nMore important, however, is what’s underneath the styling. Like their major competitors, GM pickups ride on a sturdy ladder-type frame.\n\nBut both the Ram and the new F-150 seem to have an edge in the structural derby.\n\nI’ve watched a number of torture demonstrations involving Big Three trucks bounding over bumps the size of railroad ties. The bumps were laid out in an alternating pattern so that the shocks were administered first to one side of the truck, then the other, and the maximum speed was about 20 m.p.h.\n\nObviously, all three trucks reacted to this kind of punishment, but none as dramatically as the GM truck.\n\nThe cab and the rear of the truck seemed to be marching to entirely different beats, and there were a couple of occasions when I was sure that the cargo box was about to part company with the rest of the vehicle.\n\nThe F-Series and Ram pickups didn’t twist nearly as much. The GM chassis doesn’t appear to be nearly as stiff as its competitors, and that’s a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, ride quality in GM pickups may be the best in the business, even with Toyota’s mannerly T-100 included in the reckoning.\n\nOur test truck did a surprisingly good job of smoothing out small bumps and broken pavement, even with no load to take some of the starch out of the rear springs. And with a load on board, it was even smoother.\n\nAnother area where the GM pickups enjoy an edge over the new F-150 — at least for the moment — is in optional powertrains.\n\nThe F-150’s base V6 and new 4.6-liter Triton V8 match up well with the lower tier of GM truck engines — the 4.3-liter V6 and 5.0-liter V8 — but that’s as far as the list goes until a new 5.4-liter V8 arrives this fall.\n\nAll of GM’s gasoline truck engines were given the Vortec treatment. That essentially entails vastly improved induction systems for 1996, with dramatic gains in horsepower and torque right across the board.\n\nOur test truck was equipped with the Vortec 5.0-liter V8, which generates 220 h.p., 285 pounds-feet of torque, which is essentially what the 5.7-liter V8 produced last year. The Vortec 5.7-liter went from 200 h.p. and 310 pounds-feet of torque to 250 h.p. and 335 pounds-feet.\n\nAlthough the 5.0-liter V8 performed smoothly and willingly, my preference among all the GM truck engines is the 5.7-liter V8, which is an excellent workhorse for hauling or towing or both.\n\nOther GM truck engine choices include a 7.4-liter V8 — a heavy duty performer with 290 h.p. and 410 pounds-feet of t orque, plus a pair of 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8s.\n\nDodge has an impressive array of offerings in its truck engine arsenal, too, but GM is definitely at the forefront in this department.\n\nJudging by that worried look on your face, I’ll bet you’ve glanced at the price somewhere along the way.\n\nDon’t worry. Be happy. The bottom line for our test truck is indeed pretty heavy, but it had everything except for leather upholstery and one of the bigger engines.\n\nPricing for the Club Coupe models starts at a little more than $18,000, and if you’re careful with the option shopping — you may not need four-wheel-drive, for example — you could drive home in a well-equipped truck with a 5.7-liter V8 for about $22,000, maybe less.\n\nGM’s full-size trucks may be the old kids on the block, but they’re priced right, they’ve got plenty of punch, they’re smooth on the street and now they’ve got the option of that extra door.\n\nIt’s really not so surprising tha e love our trucks in America. They keep getting easier to love.\n\nSPECS\nRATING: 3\n\nVEHICLE TYPE: Front-engine, rear-drive (4×4) full-size pickup\n\nKEY COMPETITORS: Dodge Ram, Ford F-150\n\nBASE PRICE: $20,905\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $27,437\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT: Driver’s air bag, four-wheel ABS, daytime running lamps, AM/FM radio, power mirrors, intermittent wipers, removable tailgate\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n(manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine 220-h.p. 5.0-liter V8\n\nEPA fuel econ. 14 m.p.g. city/18 hwy.\n\nCurb weight 4414 pounds\n\nWheelbase 141.5 inches\n\nLength 194.5 inches\n\nWidth 76.8 inches\n\nHeight 73.8 inches\n\nWhere assembled Oshawa, Ontario",

      "expert_review": "With its bulging rear fenders, GMC’s “sportside” Sierra pickup truck looks about as tough as a Harley-Davidson.\n\nThe “sportside” is one of two body styles available on this new truck. The “wideside,” with smooth sides, is the more typical look.\n\nSince the “sportside” bed is some 11 inches narrower than the regular one, it would not be the best choice if maximum hauling capacity is your priority. Since most pickups are personal-use vehicles, hauling capacity is not much of an issue for most folks.\n\nThe Sierra is completely new this year, and it is significantly improved over the previous model, even though its styling is not a radical departure. Key elements of the new design are a bigger cab, longer wheelbase and tons of mechanical improvements. It is available in standard 1500 and heavy-duty 2500 series.\n\nA number of items set the new Sierra apart from its predecessor. First is a new family of Vortec V8 engines that consists of 4.8-liter, 5.3-liter and 6.0-liter versions. This engine’s basic architecture shares its roots with the V8 from the Corvette, and as such it is quick-revving, powerful and gutsy.\n\nOur test truck, a four-wheel-drive (4WD) extended-cab 1500, was equipped with the 5.3-liter engine, clearly the best of the bunch for all-around use. The 5.3 cranks out a muscular 270 horsepower as well as 315 lb.ft. of torque. This engine is smaller, yet more powerful and less polluting, than the 5.7-liter engine from last year.\n\nIt picks up revs like a sports car, and does so with a minimum of vibration. Even though our test truck weighed 4,645 pounds, its performance was impressive. A quick kickdown of the throttle made passing on two-lane roads quick and easy.\n\nOne reason people buy trucks is for towing trailers. Knowing that, GMC engineers wanted the Sierra to come already equipped for such a task. The automatic transmission has a Tow/Haul mode activated by a button on the end of the gear lever. Tow/Haul lengthens the time between shifts, yet shifts quicker for less loss of momentum.\n\nTowing capacity is 8,000 pounds for a 4WD 1500 with a 5.3-liter V8 and 10,500 pounds for a heavy-duty 4WD 2500 with the 6.0-liter engine.\n\nThe second area that sets the new Sierra apart is a larger cab. The extended cab is 3.7 inches longer than last year, and the rear seat back is angled back 18 degrees for more comfortable seating.\n\nAccess to the second seat is through a third door on the passenger side. One major flaw is the lack of a fourth door, but that is being rectified on the 2000 model trucks out this fall.\n\nThe Sierra’s seats are extremely comfortable. I sampled them in both cloth and leather, and both have firm lumbar and lateral support. The leather is more luxurious, but the cloth is cooler in hot weather.\n\nSeatbelts are built into the front seats and that has a couple of benefits. Getting into the back seat is simpler because the passenger doesn’t have to duck under belts, and the belts fit the same no matter how the front seats are adjusted. Seat travel is about one-third greater than the old truck.\n\nThe instrument panel has been thoroughly revised with highly legible gauges, updated heating/cooling controls and three power outlets. Cupholders big enough to hold any drink fold out from the center.\n\nA Driver Message Center monitors 18 functions and warns if the transmission gets too hot, as it might during towing. A standard engine/hour use readout is welcome for those who know that time can be more important than mileage.\n\nHeating and cooling capacity has been increased by 40 percent, yet the sound has been reduced. Heat ducts direct warm air to rear-seat passengers’ feet.\n\nThe forward view is panoramic. Side mirrors and side windows are both larger than the old truck.\n\nThe third way the Sierra differs from last year’s truck is its hydroformed frame composed of three distinct sections. It is 28 pounds lighter than the old one, is stronger and absorbs mor energy in a crash. A side benefit is that it should be easier and less costly to repair crash damage. The wheelbase is 1.5-inches longer.\n\nAnother area of significant improvement is the brakes. Larger, four-wheel discs come with standard anti-lock, and they do a much better job of stopping quickly. Their larger size was enabled in part by the standard 16-inch wheels.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our 4WD 1500 Series extended-cab test truck was $27,230. Options included power windows, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, chrome grille, cast aluminum wheels, AM/FM stereo with CD player, the 5.3-liter V8, 3.73 axle ratio, rear window defogger, limited-slip differential and trailer package.\n\nThe sticker price was $31,407.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: More power, stronger brakes and a bigger cabin are Sierra highlights. The 5.3-liter Vortec V8 absolutely shines, ride quality is excellent and the back seat of extended-cab models is reasonably comfortable.\n\nCounterpoint: The major letdown is the lack of a fourth door on the extended cab, but that is being fixed for 2000.\n\nThe styling is conservative, but I suspect truck buyers like that.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 5.3-liter V8\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: four-wheel-drive\nWHEELBASE: 143.5 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,645 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $27,230\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $31,407\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 18 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "A sport/luxury pickup truck may sound like an oxymoron, but since pickups are rapidly become more like cars with beds instead of work vehicles, and since automakers are intent on building something to fit every conceivable market segment, it seems less perplexing.\n\nTake GMC’s Sierra C3, for example. It is loaded with enough luxury goodies to humble your basic sedan, yet performance has not been ignored either. It hits 60 mph in 8 seconds and has leather seats that are as sumptuous as the GMC Denali or Cadillac Escalade. In fact, the Sierra C3 and Denali are twins separated only by a 6.5-foot pickup bed. The fact that the bed is covered with a soft tonneau cover gives a good indication of how often buyers will actually carry cargo.\n\nThis truck sports a grille similar to the Denali and sits atop 17-inch wheels that wrap around heavy-duty disc brakes, borrowed from the three-quarter-ton Sierra, on all four wheels.\n\nIts heart is the 325-horsepower, 6.0-liter Vortec V-8 and an all-wheel-drive system that sends 38 percent of its drive to the front wheels. Instant throttle response and hill-flattening torque are the hallmarks of the Vortec V-8, and the Sierra C3 has both in spades. A 3.73 rear axle ratio and the automatic transmission’s low first gear enables it to scamper away from stoplights like a first-grader headed out to recess. A downside to all this urge is the EPA mileage rating of 11 mpg city and 14 mpg on the highway. I suppose the kind of folks who plunk down $39,000 for a pickup aren’t likely to worry too much about the cost of fuel.\n\nGMC retuned the C3’s suspension so it rides smoothly, takes turns without feeling tippy and If towing is your gig, the retuned suspension is more than able to handle it. The main benefit of the suspension change is good cornering response and over-the-road handling. Bumpy highways roll under the wheels with hardly a hiccup, and at times the ride is almost too soft. While the C3 is not a sports car, it flits through turns with excellent stability and grip, thanks in large measure to the balance created by the all-wheel drive system.\n\nNot all of the C3’s handling is golden, however. The power steering is too light at slow speeds and I would prefer a more linear feel.\n\nThe C3’s cabin is like a Sierra dressed for a fancy outing. Wood trim abounds, and the quality of the two-tone leather that adorns seats, console and door panels is on par with the best of any luxury sedans. The widely adjustable seats cradle their occupants with ample side and lumbar padding and are so comfortable I often wished I could take them into my family room. The interior color scheme is bright without being gaudy.\n\nThe large center console is big enough to store sizable objects and has a power outlet inside. The underside of the lid has a handy place for carrying a cell phone or note pad.\n\nThe leather-covered steering wheel has redundant controls for the audio system, which is handy, but their feel is n ot on par with the price of the vehicle.\n\nBack seats are increasingly commonplace in trucks, and the one in the C3, while not as roomy as a four-door cab, is certainly adequate for adult habitation on short drives. Access is through rear-opening side doors that can only be used once the main door is open. The back seat folds up to create a weather-tight cargo space. Rear-seat audio controls and cupholders are built into the back of the center console.\n\nOnStar, GM’s GPS-based wireless communication system, is standard. OnStar advisors communicate with the driver to provide a wide range of information, from checking routes to arranging accommodations. The system notifies an advisor in case of an airbag activation, and emergency help can be automatically dispatched.\n\nIf you want the amenities of a luxury SUV, the function of a pickup truck and a dose of strong performance, the Sierra C3 might just be for you.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test truck was $ ,370. Add freight and the sticker price was $39,090.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint:\nThe Sierra C3 is a mixture of luxury and performance, with a hint of practicality thrown in. The 6.0-liter V-8 has startling power and the leather interior is first-rate.\n\nCounterpoint:\nThis truck is very expensive and uses a lot of gas. The ride is a tad soft and the power steering needs a more linear feel. Finger-tip audio controls attached to the steering hub look and feel like an afterthought.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 6.0-liter, 325-hp V-8\nTransmission: automatic All-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 143.5 inches\nCurb weight: 5,013 lbs.\nBase price: $38,370\nAs driven: $39,090\nMpg rating: 11 city, 14 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSierra, a corporate twin of the Chevrolet Silverado, is the full-size pickup in GMC’s lineup. The big news for 2000 is the arrival of an extended cab with four doors this winter.\n\nPreviously, the Sierra Club Cab came with two front doors and a passenger-side third door that opens toward the rear. Now, there are rear-opening doors on both sides. The Silverado gets the fourth door as well.\n\nFor the 2001 model year, GMC and Chevy will introduce crew-cab models with four conventional doors that open toward the front, matching a feature already available on the rival Ford F-150.\n\nSierra and Silverado were redesigned for the 1999 model year and come in half-ton 1500 models and light-duty three-quarter-ton 2500 models, competing against the Ford F-150/250. GMC’s heavy-duty pickup is the Sierra Classic, an older design that comes in three-quarter-ton and one-ton versions.\n\nExterior\nThe main difference from the Silverado is at the front, where a bolder grille and prominent red GMC badge dominate the Sierra’s nose. Sierra comes as a regular cab and an extended cab with a choice of 6.5- or 8-foot cargo beds. Models with the short cargo bed can be equipped with optional flared rear fenders called Sportside.\n\nGeneral Motors claims the rear doors on its extended-cab models are the largest among full-size pickups. The rear doors cannot be opened unless the front doors are opened first.\n\nInterior\nThe extended-cab Sierra boasts more room than the ones offered by Dodge, Ford or Toyota. All Sierra models come with a modern, convenient dashboard design that puts major controls within easy reach of the driver.\n\nRegular-cab models come with a three-place bench seat or a pair of buckets, and the Club Cab adds a three-place rear bench. The rear bench is reclined 18 degrees, making it more comfortable than most rear seats in extended cabs, which are usually bolt upright.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGMC’s powertrain offerings are the same as Chevy’s. Regular-cab 1500 models come with a standard 200-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6. Two V-8s are optional on 1500 models, both with 15 horsepower more than last year: a 4.8-liter with 270 horsepower and a 5.3-liter with 285 horsepower. The 5.3-liter V-8 is standard on 2500 models and a 300-horsepower 6.0-liter V-8 is optional.\n\nAll models are available with four-wheel drive, which comes two ways in the Sierra. Insta-Trac is an on-demand system that allows shifting in and out of 4WD High on the fly. Autotrac is an automatically engaging system that sends all the power to the rear wheels on smooth, dry pavement and transfers power to the front wheels as needed on slippery surfaces.\n\nPerformance\nGMC does not offer anything that Chevy doesn’t, so there are no compelling reasons to choose one over the other. GM’s full-size pickups are worthy rivals to the big trucks from Ford and Dodge.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The 2003 GMC Sierra Denali AWD four-door pickup may be the world’s most expensive work truck, with an as-tested price of $45,370.\n\nWhile such features as four-wheel steering, a roomy rear cabin and a whopping 6.0-liter V-8 make it quite capable, this top-of-the-line pickup does not display world-class quality — certainly not befitting its luxury-car price tag, according to Paul.\n\nOn the other hand, Anita thinks the Sierra Denali is the best truck money can buy, and gives it her highest rating.\n\nShe: Here’s how I spent my weekend in the Sierra Denali. I went to every nursery in town, loaded up on mulch, topsoil and flats of impatiens. Every single person who waited on me would say, ‘Hold on a minute while I get some newspaper to protect your vehicle.’ And I’d always tell them, ‘No, I have a truck.’ But that’s only half of the story. Not only do you get the traditional truck benefits of haulability and hoseability, you get a vehicle with state-of-the-art steering — all four wheels turn when you’re cornering or parking — and you get a luxury cabin. Why is this not a five-star vehicle to you? Is it because you were laying on the couch while I was working?\n\nHe: OK, Farmer Anita, you’ve demonstrated your agricultural credentials. Now let’s talk nuts and bolts. You’ll get no argument from me about the capability of the Sierra Denali. The four-wheel steering is a truly remarkable innovation. Anybody who’s ever tried to back up a boat or horse trailer will be simply amazed at how easy that chore is with this new system. And that big 325-horsepower V-8, which makes 370 pounds-feet of torque, gives this truck more muscle than most of its competitors. I also think the exterior look is just about perfect — not tacky like the Chevrolet Avalanche or grotesque like the Cadillac Escalade EXT. It’s inside the cabin where the Sierra Denali starts to fall apart.\n\nShe: To call four-wheel steering a remarkable innovation is an understatement. It’s one of the seven wonders of the world, right up there with the Cuisinart. If this truck only had four-wheel steering and nothing else, it would still be worth five stars. I actually got emotional in parking structures. I was able to whip this 20-foot-long, 5,800-pound vehicle in and out of tight spaces as if it were a compact car.\n\nHe: Again, no argument. General Motors Corp. deserves major credit for that feature. I just wish the designers and engineers would have paid more attention to the cabin, where you spend an awful lot of your time. Granted, with the sole exception of Toyota vehicles, the interiors of GMC’s major competitors in the full-size truck segment have been equally weak. But that’s no excuse, especially on a vehicle that’s priced like a BMW 5-Series. I know you liked that gray woodgrain material; I thought it looked artificial and cheap. And there were other pretty noticeable flaws that would be unacceptable to anyone spending this kind of money on a luxury sedan. For instance, the plastic housing was pulling away from the outside edge of the driver’s seat. There were exposed screw heads in the rear armrests, and ripples in some plastic trim and rubber moldings. Sorry, but that’s just not acceptable.\n\nShe: My only problem was with the gigantic pickup bed and the overly heavy tailgate. The brainiac engineers at GM didn’t account for couch-potato husbands when they designed this truck. Surely, there’s an easier way to shut the tailgate than getting underneath it and heaving your shoulder against it or asking your lazy husband for help. And did I really need to crawl up under the fixed tonneau cover to retrieve my flats of flowers? I would like to see a cargo storage system that used the last third of the truck bed, so if you don’t have a full load, everything doesn’t slide too far forward and out of reach. I should also mention that, while the Sierra Denali is easy to park, that long bed makes it difficult to see when backing up.\n\nHe: When Ford brings its new F-150 trucks out this summer, with all the money and attention to detail they’ve spent on the interiors, I think the cabin in the Sierra Denali will look even cheaper than it does now. GM needs to spend some money and give its designers free reign to give this fine truck the equally high-quality cabin it deserves. Then the Sierra Denali will truly merit a five-star rating.\n\n2003 GMC Sierra Denali AWD\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger, four-door pickup\n\nPrice (Includes $790 destination charge.): Base, $44,255; as tested, $45,370\n\nEngine: 6.0-liter V-8; 325-hp; 370 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12 mpg city/16 mpg highway\n\nWhere built: Oshawa, Ontario\n\nKey competitors: Cadillac Escalade EXT, Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan. Rates may vary depending on coverage and driving record.): $1,492\n\nPaul’s rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes: Same monster 6.0L V-8 as Hummer H2. Big-time towing capacity. Lots of room in rear bench seat.\n\nDislikes: World’s most expensive work truck unfortunately does not have world-class quality. Fake wood looks cheap, inferior. Lousy fuel economy. Plastic housing pulling away from outside edge of driver’s seat. Exposed screw heads in rear armrests. Ripples in some plastic trim and rubber moldings.\n\nAnita’s rating: World Class\n\nLikes: Classy-looking gray woodgrain material in cabin. Best of both worlds — a true workhorse with the interior of a luxury SUV. Nicely equipped rear compartment, with cupholders, vents, audio controls. Four-wheel steering makes parking amazingly easy. Love the no-nonsense truck styling.\n\nDislikes: No adjustable pedals. Tailgate is too heavy. Difficult to see when backing up. Had to crawl up under fixed tonneau cover to retrieve flats of flowers.",

      "expert_review": "There’s no argument: The most popular vehicle in America is the pickup truck. The perennial top seller is the Ford F-150, followed by the Chevrolet Silverado. But driving trucks has drawbacks, not the least of which is the fact that they are long and not particularly easy to maneuver.\n\nNew technology is changing that. Like a lot of new technology, it’s expensive, but how much would it be worth to you to make an extended-cab pickup, with an overall length of 227.7 inches, turn in the same space required by a Saturn sedan, which is just 178.1 inches long?\n\nThat’s exactly what Delphi Corp.’s Quadrasteer does for the 2002 GMC Sierra Denali pickup. The Denali, probably the most deluxe pickup truck available, sells for $44,105, and right now, it’s the only vehicle on the market with Quadrasteer.\n\nThat will change. General Motors has a two-year exclusive deal with Delphi for use of the Quadrasteer system and is adding it to six more trucks and SUVs next year. After that, well, Delphi says it is in serious negotiations with a number of truck makers. Quadrasteer revives an idea that Honda and a few other manufacturers tried, but failed to popularize, in the late 1980s and early 1990s: four-wheel steering, meaning that the rear wheels steer to help out the front wheels. If you are turning left, for instance, the rear wheels turn just slightly to the right, to swing the rear end around the corner.\n\nBut when Honda Motor introduced four-wheel steering on the 1988 Prelude, the difference was not dramatic. The Prelude already was a small car with very good handling, and although you could tell that the four-wheel steering was working, tests suggested that it did not improve lap times on a racetrack over a regular Prelude.\n\nAnd because the Prelude was no problem to park anyway, the extra cost and complexity just wasn’t worth it. Honda dropped the four-wheel steering option in 1994, and few noticed. Various forms of four-wheel steering came and went with other manufacturers, including Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi.\n\nEnter Delphi, a technology company that used to be a part of General Motors but was spun off on its own, retaining GM as its largest customer. Delphi figured that four-wheel steering was a good idea for trucks, not cars.\n\nOn the Denali, four-wheel steering reduces the turning circle (the diameter of a circle made when a vehicle is turning with the steering wheel cranked all the way to one side) by 21%, down to just over 37 feet. That’s the same as the smallest Saturn.\n\nAnd it’s a noticeable difference. Make a sharp right turn at an intersection from a narrow road, and the rear wheel doesn’t jump over the curb. Parallel park, and the Denali feels like it is a much shorter vehicle.\n\nBut the biggest difference is in towing.\n\nAt the introduction of Quadrasteer technology at an event in Detroit, GMC laid out a very tight course in a big parking lot, lining th e course with pylons. Journalists had the chance to drive the course with the Quadrasteer on, and with it off (a dashboard-mounted switch allows you to turn the feature off).\n\nWith the system off, everyone who drove the course took out several of the plastic pylons. With Quadrasteer on, navigating was no problem, even for those who had never before towed a trailer.\n\n“The impact that four-wheel steering has is enormous,” said Sam Mancuso, marketing director for the GMC Sierra and Yukon brands. “It changes the entire driving dynamics.”\n\nIt’s a fairly simple system to understand, but an exceptionally complex system to design. The front wheels use regular hydraulic power steering, but the rear wheels steer using a big electric motor, one at each wheel.\n\nDelphi could use regular hydraulic steering, but the electric motors operate much faster. With hydraulics, there would be a delay from the time you turn the steering wheel to the time the rear wheels et the message.\n\nAt very low speeds, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction as the front wheels, helping to swing the rear around. At higher speeds, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels, aiding lane changes.\n\nAll this rear steering is not nearly as severe as the front steering. When you turn the steering wheel from side to side while stopped, you can see the rear wheels steer slightly, never more than a 12-degree angle, far less than the front wheels can turn. But it doesn’t take much to make a difference.\n\nThe downside: extra weight, cost and complexity. The rear fenders of the Denali are flared slightly, to make room for the wheels to steer. But otherwise, this is “transparent technology”–stuff that works, and works well, but otherwise calls no attention to itself.\n\nFor 2003, GMC and Chevrolet are making Quadrasteer available on less expensive extended cab and some crew cab pickups, and even on the heavy-duty version of the Suburban and Yukon SUVs. Pricing ranges from an extra $4,495 to $6,695 for a Quadrasteer package that includes other upgrades.\n\nIs it worth it? If you need a big truck to tow trailers often, or if you have to negotiate tight roads and parking lots, yes. It’s a genuine breakthrough.",

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Sierra 1500 is GMC's entrant in the half-ton, full-size pickup truck segment. It’s a corporate cousin of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, sharing the same platform, engines, body styles and major mechanical features. The Sierra has different styling, particularly in front, and GMC positions its vehicles as more upscale than Chevrolet’s. Competitors include the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\n\nThree cab styles — regular, extended and crew — and three engines are available for the Sierra 1500. All the engines are gas-powered: a 4.3-liter V-6, and 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter V-8s. As with the Silverado, the Sierra is available in 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions that offer a turbo-diesel engine and higher payloads and towing capacities.\n\n\nThe base truck gains a standard 7-inch touchscreen radio and a backup camera. The tire pressure monitor now includes a tire-fill alert that monitors how much air is pumped into a tire.\n\nSierra 2500HD and 3500HD\nThe GMC Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty pickup trucks are the true workhorses of the Sierra lineup and are designed for hauling heavy payloads and towing large trailers.\n\nChanges for 2018 include a standard backup camera on all models with a cargo bed, a standard 7-inch touchscreen radio for the base model and a new grille for the Denali version.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nStandard 360-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8\nAvailable 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 910 pounds-feet of torque\nMaximum towing capacity of 20,000 pounds with a conventional trailer hitch (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\nMaximum fifth-wheel or gooseneck towing capacity of 23,300 pounds (3500HD with dual rear wheels)",

      "expert_review": "After driving GMC’s latest half-ton offering, Cars.com reviewer Aaron Bragman went in-depth to find out just what separates the 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 from its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 sibling — also just redesigned for the 2019 model year.\n\nRelated: 2019 GMC Sierra 1500 First Drive: Fraternal or Identical Twin?\n\nThere are some obvious differences, starting with the exterior. Where the Silverado 1500 has a wilder look that shares a lot with the redesigned Camaro, the Sierra 1500 is a bit more refined and understated. Which is “better” is entirely a matter of taste, but for his money, Bragman would take the Sierra.\n\nTrick features are another highlight of the Sierra 1500. Among the nifty gadgets is a power-retractable step for easier cabin access. That’s not exactly new technology, although it’s always a classy touch. Where these steps differ is that a tap of the foot to the rearward end of the step extends the step and moves it back toward the bed, giving you access to the bed from the side of the truck — perfect for reaching anything that may be all the way toward the cab.\n\nAnother great feature is the MultiPro Tailgate, a multistage tailgate that can serve as an access step into the bed, a bed extender that can still prevent payloads from sliding out of the bed or a work surface.\n\nWatch these features and more in action as Bragman shares his thoughts on the new 2019 GMC Sierra 1500.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is an outstanding luxury pickup truck with a 6.2-liter V-8 engine that is sonorous and responsive, but it’s let down by some parts-bin interior trim and a finicky Google-based infotainment system.\n\nVersus the competition: The Sierra 1500 shines when towing and hauling, but the 6.2-liter V-8 is slower than its rivals, and the Denali Ultimate trim level isn’t quite as luxurious as the Ram 1500 Tungsten.\n\nGMC refreshed the Sierra 1500 full-size pickup truck for the 2022 model year, updating its looks and interior and introducing a Denali Ultimate trim, which is an even more luxurious Sierra than the previous flagship Denali model. For 2023, an AT4X AEV Edition joined the lineup, adding extreme off-road capabilities.\n\nWe’ve driven the updated Sierra 1500, but what we hadn’t done was pit the GMC against its chief competitors from Ford and Ram — until now. We got our hands on a 2024 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate (it stickered at $87,305, destination included) and compared it with a 2024 Ford F-150 Platinum and a 2025 Ram 1500 Tungsten.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Full-Size Pickup Truck of 2024?\n\nThere’s nothing like a head-to-head competition to help illuminate a vehicle’s strengths and weaknesses, and there’s no rivalry quite like the one among pickup trucks. You can check out our full comparison above to see the full results, but here we’ll take a deeper dive into the Sierra 1500’s qualities.\n\nDrives Like a Tank\n\nLet’s start with the Sierra 1500’s standout feature: The 6.2-liter V-8 under its hood. With 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, it’s by no means an antique, but it is one of the few remaining eight-cylinder options in the light-duty class. Ford offers its stalwart 5.0-liter V-8 in some F-150 trims, but apart from the supercharged V-8 in the F-150 Raptor R, the F-150’s performance engine is the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6. Ford is also increasing output of its PowerBoost hybrid-equipped trucks like the F-150 in our comparison. Ram has no Hemis at all in its 1500 lineup anymore; the 1500 Tungsten in our comparison boasted Ram’s H.O. SST (that’s high-output, straight-six turbo) Hurricane powerplant.\n\nBoth the Ford and Ram made more horsepower and torque than the Sierra, but neither sounded nearly as good, and both lacked the instant response and buttery smooth power delivery of the Sierra’s V-8. The Sierra was once the hot rod of the segment with this 6.2, along with its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 cousin, but in our measured acceleration testing, it was the slowest, gloriously rumbling from 0-60 mph in 6.2 seconds. That was actually quicker than the last time we tested one, but still 0.6 second slower than the Ford and 1.4 seconds slower than the Ram.\n\nHere’s the thing, though: Those times only tell a small portion of the story. The GMC sounded better than either of those trucks; my co-workers were constantly telling me, with a chuckle, that they always knew when it was the GMC doing an acceleration run. It was also far and away the most rewarding of the three when flooring the accelerator pedal. We were trying to get the absolute best times for each truck, and while the Ram tolerated a lot of brake torquing and the Ford tolerated some, the GMC performed best with just a stomp on the go pedal. When we didn’t finesse the brakes in the Ford and Ram, the times were closer, at 5.9 and 5.3 seconds, respectively. The GMC isn’t quite as slow as it seems.\n\nThe GMC’s 6.2-liter V-8 also shines while towing. One of our tests involved towing a 20-foot travel trailer, and the GMC’s powertrain got a perfect score for its performance in this category. The 6.2 performed just as smoothly with a trailer hitched to the Sierra; it was as if nothing were behind it, and it retained excellent throttle response. The driving experience while towing was just as impressive; even in high winds, the Sierra — the lightest truck in our test — felt planted and stable on the road. When the trailer’s brakes abruptly stopped functioning properly, the Sierra had the stopping power and brake-pedal feel to make our drivers feel comfortable and confident.\n\nGM’s Super Cruise hands-free, semi-autonomous driving system also adds to the Sierra’s confident driving experience — mostly. As long as they weren’t towing, our editors loved using it. This version of Super Cruise includes automatic lane changes that are intelligent and confident but not overly aggressive. Super Cruise does work when towing, and while it was convenient in stop-and-go traffic, on the highway, the system’s constant steering corrections made the experience nervier than usual. While those corrections are a useful illustration of how high-effort towing is, we’re not quite ready to turn over that much control of a truck and trailer on a windy day.\n\nAdditional towing-related tech is available, but our test vehicle did not have the necessary equipment to try out GMC’s transparent trailer system. Along with towing-enabled Super Cruise, that’s pretty much it for the GMC in this department; the Sierra 1500 is otherwise mostly old school in this area. Ford, meanwhile, offers a host of useful towing and hitching technologies, and the Ram has some, too, though we found the Ram’s to be glitchy in our testing.\n\nCan a Tank Have a Luxurious Interior?\n\nYes, yes it can. Part of the Denali Ultimate’s appeal is that it’s even more luxurious than a regular Denali. Rich leather upholstery, chunky stitching and real open-pore wood trim impress, as do the topographical design elements throughout the cabin. Real buttons and knobs to control climate, audio and other functions are welcome, and they feel solid to the touch. The only blemish in the Denali Ultimate’s interior are some plasticky bits that are clearly carried over from lower trim levels. Small details like that are what separate the Ram 1500 Tungsten from its competition, but the Denali Ultimate is the biggest challenger yet to Ram’s luxury crown.\n\nThere are other misses in the interior, too, including outward visibility, which is a major issue. The Sierra’s low, raked windshield and tall, wide hood combine with smaller side windows to create a, well, tanklike feel in the cabin that makes this truck feel bigger than it is. A minor issue is a relative lack of convenient in-cabin storage spaces, particularly up front. The cabin is so large, there’s still a decent amount of storage space, but competitors offer more — and more thoughtfully designed — storage solutions.\n\nThe GMC’s infotainment technology is also a mixed bag. While its 13.4-inch touchscreen is easy to use, with crisp graphics and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, it also uses Google Built-In technology. Years after its debut, this system still leaves a lot to be desired. We had consistent issues with voice commands in particular; some commands took forever to process and others (like switching to a new satellite radio station) succeeded or failed with no rhyme or reason.\n\nBed and Beyond\n\nBy our measurements, the Sierra 1500’s cargo bed was the widest and longest in our test, and its advantages don’t stop there. The MultiPro Tailgate can fold down into a convenient step to access the bed, though it’s a bit of a clunky process to deploy and fold up. Ford’s integrated tailgate step utilizes a better design, but the convenience is still welcome in the Sierra. GMC adds to that convenience by also giving the Sierra 1500 standard cutout steps at each corner of the rear bumper — no need to fold the tailgate down at all. On top of that, the MultiPro power steps include a trick button at their ends that slides the running boards rearward to provide access to the front of the bed from the side of the truck.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Full-Size Pickup Truck Challenge: Is the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 or GMC Sierra 1500 Best for Towing?\n2024 Full-Size Pickup Truck Challenge: Which Truck Is the Fastest?\n2024 Full-Size Pickup Truck Challenge: Which Full-Size Pickup Truck Has the Best Real-World MPG?\nResearch the 2024 GMC Sierra 1500\nFind a New GMC Sierra 1500 Near You\nUltimate Sierra?\n\nIf you’re looking for a luxurious half-ton pickup truck with a V-8, the GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is, in fact, the ultimate choice; Ram has entirely discontinued V-8 engines in its 1500 pickup, and while Ford still offers its 5.0-liter V-8 in the F-150, it’s not available in top trims. The Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is an excellent luxury truck with a well-appointed interior, confidence-inspiring towing manners and a throaty exhaust note.\n\nWith an as-tested price of $87,305, our test truck was anything but cheap — though it was still the least expensive pickup in our comparison by a small amount. Ultimately (pun intended), luxury pickup shoppers will have to decide what matters most to them. If what matters to you is luxury with an old-school V-8 growl, the Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is the truck for you.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe 2023 GMC Sierra is a full-size pickup truck that shares a platform and powertrains with its sibling, the Chevrolet Silverado. The Sierra is available with a standard turbocharged four-cylinder, two optional V-8s or a torque-rich turbo-diesel inline-six. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but the Sierra can be outfitted with a variety of four-wheel-drive systems and a number of features to boost towing capacity or all-terrain prowess. The Sierra is a hardworking truck at heart, but it can be turned into a veritable luxury vehicle in its range-topping Denali trims — just be prepared for some sticker shock if you scale the heights of this truck’s option sheet.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe big news for the 2023 model year is the addition of an off-road-themed AT4X AEV Edition. This includes adventure-related hardware like a front winch, additional underbody skid plates, front and rear steel bumpers, and black 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in chunky 33-inch all-terrain tires. GMC has also improved the horsepower and torque ratings of the optional Duramax turbo-diesel inline-six. Output for the diesel now comes in at 305 horsepower and 429 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Sierra 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nOne USB port\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\n17-inch steel wheels\nFront bench seat, vinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\n13.4-inch touchscreen\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nBed-mounted 120-volt outlet\nBed-mounted stereo system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nSuper Cruise self-driving aid\nShould I Buy the 2023 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe GMC Sierra has an impressive roster of powertrains and features that take the fight to key rivals, especially the hugely popular Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. While it’s more expensive than the Silverado, the Sierra is equipped with higher-quality cabin trim and additional features to help justify the price premium. If you’re new to the full-size pickup truck market, however, you might be in for a rude awakening when you see how high the asking price of a Sierra can go in its top-of-the-line Denali Ultimate trim.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 is a full-size pickup truck available with a standard turbocharged four-cylinder, two optional V-8s or a torque-rich turbo-diesel inline-six. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but the Sierra can also be outfitted with a variety of four-wheel-drive systems, as well as many features that enhance towing capacity and off-road capability. With three cab sizes and three cargo bed lengths, the Sierra is a work truck at heart; it’s a mechanical twin to the Chevrolet Silverado. The Denali and Denali Ultimate trims pack in luxury touches and comfort features, but they also significantly elevate the Sierra’s price tag. The Sierra’s rivals consist of the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nOther than a newly available 22-inch wheel design and a couple of additions to the standard equipment list on some trims, the Sierra 1500 stands pat for 2025.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe Sierra’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 8,900 to 13,300 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500 Weigh?\n\nThe Sierra’s curb weight ranges from 4,410-5,550 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix-speaker stereo\nOne USB port\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\n17-inch steel wheels\nFront bench seat, vinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure warning\nLane-centering steering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n13.4-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nBed-mounted 120-volt outlet\nBed-mounted stereo system\nSurround-view parking camera\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2025 GMC Sierra 1500?\n\nThe full-size truck market is possibly the most competitive segment in the automotive world. Helping the Sierra 1500 stand out from its Ford, Ram and Toyota rivals is a healthy lineup of tech and comfort features, a powerful range of gas- and diesel-powered engines, and some truly world-class towing technology. But is this enough to separate the Sierra from its less expensive sibling, the Silverado? If pricing is a major sticking point, test drive both to see if the Sierra justifies its premium.",

      "expert_review": "There’s good truck news at Chevrolet and GMC for 2004 that you likely haven’t heard yet. In a moment, you’ll understand why.\n\nIn past tests, I’ve celebrated the innovation called Quadrasteer, a system developed by Delphi that allows for the rear wheels to steer. It was introduced by GMC in 2001 and has moved to Chevrolet trucks and SUVs, too.\n\nWith Quadrasteer, an extended-cab pickup, with an overall length of 227.7 inches, can turn in the same space required by Saturn sedan, which is 178.1 inches long.\n\nQuadrasteer revives an idea that Honda and a few other manufacturers tried, and failed, to popularize in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With four-wheel steering, the rear wheels steer just as the front wheels do. If you are turning left, for instance, the rear wheels turn just slightly to the right, to swing the rear end around the corner. Hook and ladder fire trucks have used the system for years.\n\nBut when Honda introduced four-wheel steering on the 1988 Honda Prelude, the difference was not dramatic. The Prelude already was a small, good-handling car that was no problem to park – four-wheel steering just wasn’t worth the extra cost and complexity. Honda dropped the option in 1994, and few noticed.\n\nOn a big truck, though, four-wheel steering works. It was a hit when it was introduced on the 2002 GMC Denali, but the price is prohibitive. It added $4,495 to the 2003 GMC extended-cab test truck reviewed here.\n\nAnd now for the good news: On 2004 models of GMC and Chevrolet trucks and SUVs available with Quadra-steer, it adds $1,995.\n\nBut you see the problem Chevy and GMC dealers have, don’t you? What do you say to the customer who paid $4,495 for Quadrasteer a few months ago? “Sorry, but you should have waited!” won’t help.\n\nAt any price, Quadrasteer is a minor revelation. At highway speeds, Quadrasteer allows the rear wheels to steer slightly in the same direction as the front wheels, which marginally improves tracking. But it’s at low speeds that Quadrasteer earns its keep, since it enables the rear wheels to turn 12 degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels, thus swinging the rear end around. It’s essentially transparent – you don’t notice anything other than the fact that the truck seems 2 feet shorter than it is. And, if you want, you can turn the option off.\n\nFortunately, Quadrasteer is attached to a very nice vehicle. The test truck, a top-of-the-line, four-wheel-drive GMC Sierra SLT, was loaded with everything you would want in a luxury car, from leather upholstery to the addictive XM satellite radio. Under the hood, there’s the old-school 5.3-liter V-8, mated to a responsive four-speed automatic transmission. The steering and suspension aren’t quite as precise as the new-for-2004 Ford F-150, but this remains one of my favorite pickups.\n\nThe 2004 models are essentially unchanged from this 2003, save a few minor options package adjustm ents. This is a very stout truck, with decent room in the rear seat, but an overall size that won’t overwhelm you.\n\nAnd then there’s Quadrasteer – several years ago, a GM executive asked me what I’d be willing to pay for the option, and I told him $2,000. They’ve met my price, plus $5. Expect to see a lot more Quadrasteer-equipped trucks – and expect to see a few annoyed Quadrasteer buyers from the past couple of years, once they hear about the price cut.\n\nBase price: $32,492.\n\nPrice, tested: $41,990.\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city, 18 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: 4-wheel-drive; 5.3-liter, 285 horsepower V-8; 4-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado share the same platform, but the GMC product is often positioned as a more upscale offering. Mechanically, the trucks are the same. There might be slight differences in curb weight and payload, but they share the same powertrain and chassis components. There are five engines and five suspensions in the lineup.\n\nThe Sierra comes in regular, extended and crew-cab forms. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive. The Sierra comes in five trim levels: Work Truck, SL (crew cab only), SLE, SLT and Denali.\n\nMost V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models get more than 10,000 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are only minor changes for the 2011 Sierra half-ton pickup. The Sierra gets the latest OnStar 9.0 system, revised exterior color offerings and insulating enhancements that help reduce wind noise.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, the common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. The upscale Denali trim features a unique chrome grille and wheels. Exterior features include:\n\n\nVery wide rear-door openings on extended cab models to load passengers, cargo\nRange of 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nEZ Lift tailgate available\n\nInterior\nThe Sierra showcases two different interior designs. Work Truck and SLE models are more utility-minded, with large controls and door handles that can be operated while wearing gloves. The SLT offers upgraded materials and a different dash design. The Sierra’s cab is inviting, spacious and well-organized. Leather seating is available on the SLE and standard on the SLT. The SLT also gets a Bose stereo, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a heated windshield-washer system. Denali trim is the most luxurious package available for a GM pickup with upgraded trim and materials.

It’s standard on all V-8 models. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are now standard on all half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts.

      "expert_review": "You’ve seen this pickup truck before. In fact, you’ve seen this truck for a long time, as it was introduced for the 2007 model year. It’s been around longer than any other current full-size pickup except the Nissan Titan, and right now, GM is building the final models before switching over to the refreshed 2014 version that’s due later this summer.\n\nThis is the last hurrah for the 2013 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali before the new model replaces it.\n\nSome may wonder why we’d test one of these instead of waiting a few months for the next model. Well, while the new 2014 GMC Sierra may be just around the corner, the 2013 is still an extremely capable, powerful, comfortable rig with a practically bulletproof reliability — given how long this truck has been built, GM worked out the manufacturing and design kinks a long time ago. Because the company is looking to clear dealer lots of the 2013 models before the 2014s arrive, there are some sweet deals on these trucks at local GMC showrooms.\n\nJust about everything remains unchanged from the 2012 to 2013 model year for the Sierra, with the exception of two new colors that aren’t available on the Denali anyway. Powertrains haven’t changed for the Denali model; it’s still the FlexFuel 6.2L V-8 cranking out 403 hp and 417 pounds-feet of torque and still utilizing GM’s previous-gen Active Fuel Management (AFM) cylinder deactivation, which is designed to seamlessly cut fuel off during certain level-ground cruising and coasting situations to help improve fuel economy. Both feature GM’s Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation, which seamlessly cuts off fuel during cruising situations to help improve fuel economy slightly.\n\nThe standard transmission is GM’s 6L80 Hydra-Matic six-speed automatic, coupled with an electronic transfer case and full-time all-wheel drive. Our Onyx Black Metallic Denali moved confidently into traffic (thanks to a torque monster of a motor) yet rumbled quietly around town without any issues. We didn’t do any towing or hauling with our week in the truck (seeing as how it was the media preview at the 2013 Detroit auto show and we were otherwise occupied), but the Sierra Denali’s 1,623-pound max payload and 9,400-pound towing capacity are more than up to most tasks. Fuel economy is EPA rated at 12/18 mpg city/highway, and we observed 14.5 mpg in mixed use, including a lot of 80 mph highway jaunts between Ann Arbor, Mich., and Detroit.\n\nWith the cancellation of the Cadillac Escalade EXT, the Sierra Denali currently sits as GM’s most luxurious light-duty pickup. Although the interior shows its age in terms of design and function, it is still a comfortable, pleasant place to spend time. The heated and cooled seats are 12-way power adjustable and covered in premium leather. The instrument panel’s familiarity and plastic quality are ready for this year’s coming refresh, but the assembly quality and tactile feel of the attractive chocolate brown two-tone interior is still top notch. The green glowing gauges, LCD readouts and fingernail-sized buttons on the multimedia system are all overdue for the history books, but they remain easily legible and largely uncomplicated. It’s a dated interior, especially after seeing previews of the new one in person, but the uplevel touches that come with the Denali trim level still keep things respectable in the cabin.\n\nThere is something to be said for buying a truck that’s going out of production. The latest Ram 1500 and Ford F-150 have both been refreshed and feature all the modern conveniences of passenger cars — for better (Chrysler Uconnect) and worse (MyFord Touch). The ’13 Sierra 1500 has none of this advanced technology; it merely has an easy-to-use navigation system, backup camera and easy interface for plugging in a media player like an iPod. No confounding voice controls, no finicky quasi-functional touch-sensitive panels. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have auto-up windows, Bluetooth audio streaming or tilt/telescoping steering wheel, but such are the trade-offs. \n\nThe price starts at a well-equipped $49,630, including a $995 destination charge. Our tester came equipped with navigation, power sunroof, chrome steps, an integrated trailer brake controller and a 3.42 ratio rear axle for a total of $53,694. That might seem a little steep for a truck in its last days, but current deals from GMC are quite strong for the outgoing Sierra.\n\nWhile no factory spiffs are being offered on the Denali trim model just yet, GMC is taking up to $8,000 off the price of a Sierra 1500 SLE with a special value package. As the year continues on and summer approaches, those deals are likely to get better and better as GM works to clear inventory of 2013 models in preparation for the redesigned 2014 models. With discounts that big, the significant positive traits of the outgoing model make this a truly solid deal.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado share the same platform, but the GMC product is often positioned as a more upscale offering. Mechanically, the trucks are the same. There might be slight differences in curb weight and payload, but they share the same powertrain and chassis components. Versions of the Sierra seat up to six people. Competitors include the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500.\n\nThe Sierra comes in regular, extended and crew-cab forms. Standard (6-foot-6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot,-9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive. The Sierra comes in five trim levels: Work Truck, SL, SLE, SLT and Denali.\n\nMost V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models get more than 10,000 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nThe heavy-duty versions of the Sierra give buyers significantly more towing capacity — up to 23,000 pounds — when properly equipped. They also offer an optional 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Sierra Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Sierra Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Sierra. The Sierra Hybrid is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are a few minor changes for 2012, including a new three-bar chrome grille on SLE and SLT models. A hard-drive-based navigation radio is now available for Denali and SLT models, and the SLT can also have heated and cooled seats. The stability system adds electronic trailer-sway control and hill start assist. Plus, the high-end Sierra Denali gains heated and cooled front seats, a leather-wrapped heated steering wheel and a backup camera.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, the common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. The upscale Denali trim features a unique chrome grille and wheels. Exterior features include:\n\nVery wide rear-door openings on extended cab models to load passengers, cargo\nRange of 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe Sierra showcases two different interior designs. Lower-end trucks are more utility-minded, with large door handles that can be operated while wearing gloves.\n\nThe SLT offers upgraded materials and a different dash design. The Sierra’s cab is inviting, spacious and well-organized. Leather seating is available on the SLE and standard on the SLT. The SLT also gets a Bose stereo and a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. The Denali trim is the most luxurious of any GM pickup truck with upgraded trim and materials. Interior features include:\n\nStadium-style rear seating\nCruise control   \nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable navigation system   \nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\nAvailable integrated trailer-brake control\nAvailable leather-wrapped heated steering wheel\nAvailable backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Sierra offers five available suspensions, including an off-road-oriented Z71 package and the NHT enhanced trailering package. The 5.3-liter V-8 features fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation technology. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas) or 348pounds-feet of torque (E85).\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas) or 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nThe Sierra’s standard electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology.  GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nSide curtain airbags\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\n\nSierra 2500HD and 3500HD\nThe heavy-duty Sierra is the towing and hauling workhorse, with the ability to tow up to 23,000 pounds with a fifth-wheel hitch. Maximum payload capacity is 7,215 pounds. The heavy-duty Sierra’s suspension and structure have been strengthened for 2012, enabling the stout capacities. With a conventional trailer hitch, towing capacity is 18,000 pounds.\n\nThe Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD are available with a 6.0-liter gas V-8 or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine. A 36-gallon fuel tank is standard and gives trucks with the diesel engine a driving range of up to 680 miles, according to Chevrolet. An available smart exhaust brake provides greater control on downward grades and reduced brake-pad wear. \n\nNew features for the 2012 heavy-duty Sierra Denali include heated and cooled front seats, a backup camera and a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. A hard-drive-based navigation system with satellite radio and a USB port is available. Additional features include:\n\n\nRegular, extended or crew-cab body styles\nStandard or long bed\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nFully boxed high-strength-steel frame\nNew chrome grille on SLE and SLT\nAvailable dealer-installed Wi-Fi system for mobile internet access\nAvailable high-idle switch\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "While Chevy and Ford trucks are ubiquitous at any regional rodeo, General Motors’ GMC lineup better recalls Rodeo Drive.\n\nWith its confident stance, big-rig persona and a somewhat pretentious aura inside and out, the 2015 GMC Sierra 1500 perfectly accommodates today’s movers and shakers, with capable moves … and virtually no shaking.\n\nStill fresh from its 2014 redesign, the Sierra’s changes for 2015 are relatively modest: Trucks equipped with the optional 6.2-liter V-8 now get an eight-speed automatic in place of the previous six-speed, which bumps efficiency while maintaining capability. And as you’d guess, beyond the hardware is software, including features such as text/messaging alerts, Siri Eyes Free and a new built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, all standard on SLE, SLT and Denali trims. See the two model years compared side by side here.\n\nWe drove various versions of the Sierra, but this review concentrates on a 1500 crew cab SLT with four-wheel drive and the 6.2-liter V-8, which we pitted against similarly equipped Chevrolet, Ford, Ram and Toyota trucks in the Cars.com/PickupTrucks.com 2015 Light-Duty V-8 Challenge. Aggressively optioned and sporting a window sticker of just under $55,000, our test Sierra would be perfect for a long weekend or longer vacation.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIn addition to our full-size crew cab, GMC offers extended (double cab) and regular cabs. While the double cab comes only with a 6.6-foot cargo box, the crew and regular cabs each offer a choice of two cargo box lengths, tied to the truck’s wheelbase (and thus its overall length): As an alternative to our test Sierra’s 5.75-foot box, the crew cab can also be had with a 6.5-foot box; regular cabs come with 6.6- or 8-foot boxes.\n\nWith last year’s redesign, GMC and Chevrolet made a real effort to achieve greater design differentiation between their sister trucks, the Sierra and Silverado. All Sierras are fronted by an aggressive, big rig grille treatment. There, the amount of brightwork is variable; on base trims the grilles are adorned with black, while on the top, Denali trim they’re blinged-out. The grilles in the middle of the lineup (SLE and SLT) split the difference, offering just enough subtlety to keep you rooted in the country and just enough chrome to park at the country club.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Sierra comes with a choice of 4.3-liter V-6, 5.3-liter V-8 and 6.2-liter V-8 engines; the two smaller engines still pair with a six-speed automatic transmission. Our test vehicle, equipped with the 6.2-liter and eight-speed transmission, was as capable as any light-duty pickup you’ll find. Generously supplying 420 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 460 pounds-feet of torque at 4,100 rpm, the Sierra moves with authority: In our Challenge testing, it went from zero to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds with no cargo, and added just 1 second with 1,200 pounds of payload in the bed.\n\nWith 6,700 pounds of trailer and cargo, the performance is even more impressive. In our testing against a similarly powered Silverado, F-150, Toyota Tundra and Ram, there was nothing — in my opinion — that towed with the authority exhibited by the Sierra.\n\nOf course, what goes also has to stop. The Sierra was fully competitive in braking, coming to a halt from 60 mph in 138.9 feet, or 148.7 feet with 1,240 pounds of payload. The best braking was achieved by the Silverado (133.7 feet empty and 132.2 feet loaded), while the longest braking distances came from Toyota’s Tundra TRD Pro (159.6/157.8 feet), likely because it was equipped with off-road tires and a raised ride height.\n\nWith today’s pickups, trucklike capability doesn’t automatically translate to a trucklike ride. Again in our comparison, we found the GMC to best combine unladen ride comfort with the necessary composure while loaded or towing. The Sierra’s steering feel, comfortable ride and composed handling combined to provide a level of confidence that both a trucking novice and a savvy veteran could appreciate.\n\nWith all this over-the-road goodness, the Sierra delivered almost 19.6 mpg on the Cars.com mileage loop without a trailer; it got 10 mpg when towing 6,750 pounds. Those efficiency numbers were helped in no small part by the V-8’s cylinder deactivation and the transmission’s eight speeds. The Silverado equipped with the same powertrain was the best in the unladen test, achieving 19.8 mpg, and the F-150 was the most efficient when towing, with 11.0 mpg observed.\n\nIf a buyer’s budget and/or usage demand less displacement and a comparatively lower window sticker, my time behind the wheel of the smaller V-8 and V-6 left me comfortable with the idea of owning either one of those, as well. The biggest surprise was the smallest engine, which had trucklike torque emanating from a small block that was no longer trucklike in its behavior. Regardless of drivetrain, know that GM has done an optimal job combining capability with simplicity — and the feeling of durability that goes along with it.\n\nInterior\nThis isn’t (to channel an old Oldsmobile ad) your dad’s GMC. With the exception of the base Sierra, you’ll enjoy an interior with upscale appointments, careful attention to detail and virtually nothing in its execution that confuses or confounds.\n\nAlthough the Sierra’s step-in height is higher than your mom’s Buick Lucerne, neither she nor anyone else in the immediate family should be challenged by the Sierra’s accessibility, even if it’s not equipped with running boards. Once inside, both driver and passengers will enjoy comfortable, supportive seating, along with generous headroom, legroom and shoulder room. Up front, aluminum accents frame a premium look, and there’s a soft feel. Contrasting stitching provides an upscale, contemporary aspect to one of America’s oldest vehicle categories. Two glove boxes combine to provide adequate storage, and while the available center armrest/console doesn’t supply enough room to warehouse an office, there is convenient space for the miscellany that often comes with a “mixed use” (business and pleasure) environment.\n\nFunctionally, the GMC’s instrumentation provides a full menu of information, including engine speed and mph, along with alternator, fuel, temperature and oil-pressure readouts. The instrumentation is well-lit and appropriately sized, regardless of light conditions or whether your reading glasses are in place. In sum, the Sierra supplies all the info you need in the absence of your own flight engineer.\n\nIn the back of our test crew cab, passengers enjoyed easy access and, once seated, almost 2 inches of additional legroom compared with the previous generation. (GMC’s available double cab has 6 inches less backseat legroom — 34.6 inches versus 40.9 inches in the crew.)\n\nCompared with the other crew cabs in the Challenge, the Silverado is identical and the Ram crew cab’s backseat legroom is a half inch shy of the Sierra’s. The F-150 SuperCrew beats them all, with 43.6 inches. The Tundra Crew Max has 42.3 inches of backseat legroom. (See our Sierra’s specs alongside those of the Chevy, Ford and Ram here and against the Tundra here.)\n\nGM made a huge effort to insulate passengers from road noise, and while the quiet may not be library-like, it is notable in the pickup category. And with a generous glass area both front and rear, passengers can enjoy the view while the driver suffers nary a blind spot. Finally, while we drove a Sierra SLT, owners of the Denali will enjoy even more luxurious appointments, fully in keeping with their upscale ZIP codes and expensive pursuits.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMost Sierra models provide a backup camera, which proves to be just the ticket for a big truck confronted with small spaces or congested parking lots. The optional Bose audio does exactly what you’d hope a premium system would: George Strait will sound like George Strait, and George Jones will — correctly — sound like George Jones.\n\nWe checked out the Sierra’s OnStar 4G LTE hotspot, the connection speed of which varied by location (as is true of all cellular devices), but it was always fast enough to stream video — something that’s often not possible with a 3G connection. If you’ve checked the appropriate option boxes, the Sierra provides up to six USB ports, four auxiliary power outlets and a 110-volt outlet, all designed to keep both front and rear occupants fully connected and powered.\n\nThat connectivity is made easier and more accessible by the Sierra’s available 8-inch touch-screen. Of course, you could also turn the electronic distractions off (I did) and simply drive … .\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe 2015 Sierra — in any of its powertrain iterations — is uber-capable of hauling virtually anything you might want to haul. In base form, with nothing under the hood but six spark plugs and an oil filter, you can tow up to 7,600 pounds. Those with a horse trailer, horses and a gas card should opt for the 6.2-liter V-8 and Max Trailering Package; the end result is up to 12,000 pounds of towing capability. Drop down to the 5.3 liter V-8 and that towing number drops to a still-respectable 11,200 pounds.\n\nTowing, of course, is one aspect of capability; payload is the other. Again, with our 6.2-liter V-8 coupled with four-wheel drive and a 3.42:1 rear axle ratio, the Sierra’s available payload was 1,960 pounds (all Sierras have a payload of at least 1,700 pounds). Of course, load the crew cab with five adults weighing 220 pounds apiece, and your remaining payload capability is less than 900 pounds. That remains a substantial amount, though, and comes close to equaling the half-ton descriptive assigned to the light-duty category. The GMC payload was the best in our sampling, besting the F-150 by 80 pounds and almost lapping the Ram 1500, at 1,120 pounds, as equipped.\n\nBeyond the numbers, of course, is the feel. And as mentioned earlier, no pickup in the comparison felt quite so confident — or inspired so much confidence — as the Sierra SLT when towing or hauling. Credit the improved structural rigidity (beginning with the 2014 redesign) of a fully boxed frame, as well as its widened track and wider wheels. GMC’s Max Trailering Package takes all that engineering goodness and supplements it with a 9.75-inch ring gear, trailer brake controller, enhanced cooling, revised shock tuning and heavier-duty rear springs. If you’re going to tow, do it to the Max … .\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the GMC Sierra 1500 crew cab earned five stars out of five in all crash categories except the overall rollover rating, where it earned four, which is the most you can expect from a pickup. Full results are here.\n\nBeyond passive safety (the ability to survive a collision or rollover) is active safety, which is the ability to avoid an accident in the first place. And here the GMC’s aforementioned stability, braking and steering come to the forefront. Those built-in attributes are augmented by standard StabiliTrak electronic stability control (with rollover mitigation), trailer sway control and hill-start assist.\n\nGMC also has an optional Driver Alert Package, which can notify you of an imminent forward collision and/or lane departure.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDespite harboring a very real disconnect between “pickup” and “$55,000,” I found our test Sierra 1500 SLT to be an extremely good value when compared with its competition, which ranged from the mid-$40,000s for the Toyota Tundra and Ford F-150, to the Silverado Z71 LTZ and Ram 1500 Longhorn, whose stickers nudged the Sierra’s $55,000 (all as tested). With only a few hundred dollars typically separating the Sierra from its comparable Silverado counterpart, I might opt for the smaller, more personal selling environment of the typical Buick/GMC showroom over the big box “splendor” of the Chevy store.\n\nWhile purchase price is always a consideration, know that the cost of ownership is what you spend minus what you get in return at trade-in. Historically, most pickup trucks retain a higher percentage of initial cost than do most family vehicles. And while I still wouldn’t spread the payments over 72 months, at least trucks provide a level of durability in excess of that six-year schedule.\n\nIn short, I’m more impressed by trucks priced below $40K than those nudging $60K, but the Sierra SLT — and its maximum capability — make a compelling argument for spending (or financing) that almost-princely sum.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado share the same platform, but the GMC product is often positioned as a more upscale offering. Mechanically, the trucks are the same. There might be slight differences in curb weight and payload, but they share the same powertrain and chassis components. There are five engines and five suspensions in the lineup.\n\nThe Sierra comes in regular, extended and crew cab forms. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive. The Sierra comes in four trim levels: Work Truck, SL (crew cab only), SLE and SLT. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models get more than 10,000 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nNew for 2010\nGM has dropped the long-running 6.0-liter V-8 engine from the Sierra lineup, leaving the powerful 6.2-liter V-8 for heavy towing needs. The rest of the Sierra’s eight-cylinder lineup benefits from increased availability of its new six-speed transmission for regular and extended cab models equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8. Also, the 4.8-liter and 5.3-liter V-8 engines have been enhanced, with variable valve timing for improved emissions and better fuel economy.\n\nThose with portable MP3 players can connect and play their music collections with the truck’s audio system through a USB connection. Standard side curtain and side-impact airbags are welcome safety additions.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, the common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban.\n\nVery wide rear-door openings on extended cab models to load passengers, cargo\nRange of 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nEZ Lift tailgate available\n\nInterior\nThe Sierra showcases two different interior designs. Work Truck and SLE models are more utility-minded, with large controls and door handles that can be operated while wearing gloves. The SLT offers upgraded materials and a different dash design. The Sierra’s cab is inviting, spacious and well-organized. Leather seating is available on the SLE and standard on the SLT. The SLT also gets a Bose stereo, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a heated windshield-washer system.\n\nStadium-style rear seating\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable moonroof\nAvailable navigation system on SLE and SLT\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\nIntegrated trailer-brake control\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 338 pounds-feet of torque (gas) or 350 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 338 pounds-feet of torque (gas) or 350 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block/cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic\nSix-speed automatic\n\nSafety\nGM is aggressive in promoting the benefits of OnStar 8.0. New-truck buyers get a one-year subscription to the Safe and Sound Plan, after which owners can subscribe annually. If an airbag deploys, OnStar contacts an adviser and can report crash data to emergency services. The Sierra offers roof-mounted side curtain airbags as standard equipment on all trim levels. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are also standard. An electronic stability system is now standard on all Sierra models.\n\nAvailable ultrasonic rear parking assist\nTraction control\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nSeat belt pretensioners activate in rear-end impacts\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: 7,000 pounds (4×4 crew cab, extended cab)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,924 pounds (4×2 crew cab short box)\nMaximum towing capacity: 10,700 pounds (4×2 extended cab with enhanced trailer package, 6.2-liter V-8 and 3.73 rear axle)\nFuel tank capacity: 26 gallons (SWB), 34 gallons (LWB)\nAxle ratio: 3.08:1, 3.23:1, 3.42:1, 3.73:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 8.4 inches (regular cab 4×2 SWB), 9.1 inches (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 8.9 inches (regular cab 4×2 LWB, extended cab 4×2 SWB), 9.5 inches (regular cab 4×4 LWB), 9 inches (extended cab 4×4 SWB, extended cab 4×2 LWB, crew cab), 9.3 inches (extended cab 4×4 LWB)\nApproach angle: 15.6 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 15.8 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 15.5 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nDeparture angle: 24.2 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 22 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 23.1 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nRamp breakover: 24.4 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 17.8 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 19.6 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nCargo-bed load height: 35.4 inches (regular cab 4×2 SWB), 34.5 inches (regular cab 4×4 LWB), 34.4 inches (extended cab 4×2 SWB), 33.6 inches (extended cab 4×4 LWB), 33.5 inches (crew cab 4×2), 33.8 inches (crew cab 4×4)\nCargo floor length: 69.3 inches (short bed), 78.8 inches (standard bed), 97.7 inches (long bed)\nCargo floor width: 62.4 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 50.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 21 inches",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra’s bodywork is new, the interior is new and the engines are new. Virtually everything else has been tuned, tweaked or calibrated for improvement, from disc brakes in back to measures aimed at making it the quietest, smoothest GMC pickup ever.\n\nNew for 2014\nSierra gets new bodywork, a new interior, some new cab and bed options, a new All-Terrain model and new engines. \n\nThose engines are the same displacement as last year’s 4.3-liter V-6 and 5.3- and 6.2-liter V-8s, but only the V-8s share bore/stroke dimensions with their predecessors. Horsepower, torque and fuel economy have not yet been published. All engines are paired to an updated six-speed automatic.\nExterior\n\nSince the new Sierra bumpers are higher than the old ones and bumpers no longer wrap around corners, GMC put steps into the bumper corners so owners can climb up for loading whether the tailgate is open or closed. You can get tie-down points mounted high on the bed as well, and LED lighting under the bed rail for night loading or to check cargo without lights shining on traffic behind you. The tailgate can be fitted with assists to ease opening and closing.\n\nUp front the Sierra becomes the first pickup to get projector headlamps on all models. The aluminum hood is as tall as last year’s Sierra 2500 HD.\n\nThe cab’s door openings no longer wrap over into the roofline and are tighter, as are all bodywork seams; the B-pillar behind the front door is moved forward.\n\nWider wheels still have lots of room in the fender openings, and the molded-in flares almost reach the hood and tailgate.\n\nCrew cab buyers can now get a 6-foot 6-inch bed in addition to the 5-foot-8-inch bed, but extended cab buyers can get only the 6-foot-6-inch box because the 8-foot bed is reserved only for regular cab models.\n\nInterior\n\nFor 2014 the GMC gauges remain, though they are grouped to frame an optional 4-inch display inset, and they are better lit. Trailer brake, headlight and drive-mode switches are stacked on the top left of the dash.\n\nKnobs and switches are designed to be used with gloves on. The shifter is column-mounted as before, with tow/haul and manual forward gear selection on the end.\n\nGMC’s IntelliLink can link up to 10 devices, includes voice recognition and lets passengers make phone calls, enter destinations, browse media, play music and more by telling the vehicle what to do. It will also store contact information and 60 favorite radio stations.\nUnder the Hood\n\nGMC hasn’t yet provided specifics for the new line of EcoTec3 engines: the LV3 4.3-liter V-6, the L83 5.3-liter V-8 and the L86 6.2-liter V-8.\n\nAs before, the new engines are pushrod design, but now have variable valve timing. They also share direct fuel injection for higher compression ratios and aluminum blocks for all, six-bolt main bearings, stressed aluminum oil pans, piston-cooling oil jets, greater oil capacity and mechanical vacuum pump for brakes and ventilation controls.\n\nAll three engines have cylinder deactivation, which converts them to V-4 operation; it’s a fuel-saving feature under low loads but not at idle when smoothness might be compromised.\nSafety\nSierra will offer an optional camera-based forward collision alert system that also provides lane departure warning. In addition to audible and visual warnings, an available seat adds a tactile warning as well. Standard and optional safety gear also includes  front and head curtain side airbags, OnStar, park assist and rear camera, hill start assist and descent control, and stability with trailer-sway control.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2008 about the 2008 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab SLT. For 2009, a new six-speed automatic transmission that improves gas mileage is available. To see what else is new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nUnlike other truck builders, which rely on one nameplate for success in the full-size truck market, GM offers two models — the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra — that share the same platform and have other similarities. The Silverado is far and away the more popular of the two models, but truck buyers shouldn’t overlook the Sierra just because there aren’t as many of them. For a truck, the GMC offers a refined driving experience and, in higher trim levels, an upscale cabin that wouldn’t be out of place in a premium SUV.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe biggest difference between the Silverado and Sierra is in the trucks’ front-end appearance. Both feature grilles that are heavy on chrome, but each has a different design; the Silverado has a prominent bar that bisects the grille, while the Sierra uses thin slats. I prefer the Sierra’s chiseled front end mainly because it looks manlier — always a good thing where trucks are concerned — and more assertive (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model).\n\nLight-duty Sierras are available in three body styles: regular cab, extended cab and crew cab, which is the version I tested. There’s also a variety of cargo box lengths. The short box measures 5.8 feet long and is available on extended cab and crew cab models. The standard box is 6.5 feet long, and the long box is 8.1 feet long; both bed lengths are available for regular and extended cab trucks.\n\nRide & Handling\nFull-size crew cab pickup trucks are the vehicle of choice for some families, which makes ride quality a more important factor than it was when crew cabs were, as the name implies, primarily used for carrying work crews around. The Sierra does a good job meeting the demands of the modern truck buyer, as it cruises comfortably but also retains the capability expected of a full-size pickup.\n\nSuspension tuning plays a big role in ride quality, and the Sierra I tested featured a Z71 Off-Road suspension package as well as an All Terrain option package, which is new for 2008. With an unladen cargo bed the Sierra’s ride quality is fairly stiff, but the suspension does a good job soaking up large imperfections in the road. Reasonably precise steering response gives the driver much appreciated confidence when driving at highway speeds.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nJust as there are a number of different cab and cargo boxes available for the light-duty Sierra, there’s a range of V-8 engines and one V-6 that can have anywhere from 195 to 403 horsepower. My test truck had one of the midlevel engines — an all-aluminum 5.3-liter V-8 rated at 315 hp and 338 pounds-feet of torque. The engine features GM’s cylinder-deactivation technology that cuts off fuel to four of the engine’s eight cylinders, temporarily turning it into a V-4. This fuel-saving measure operates without the driver’s involvement and helps the Sierra achieve class-leading gas mileage estimates.\n\nGas Mileage Compared\n \t2WD\t4WD\nGMC Sierra w/5.3-liter V-8\t15/20\t14/19\nToyota Tundra w/5.7-liter V-8\t14/18\t13/17\nDodge Ram w/5.7-liter V-8\t13/19\t13/17\nFord F-150 w/5.4-liter V-8\t13/17\t13/17\nNissan Titan w/5.6-liter V-8\t12/17\t12/17\nSource: www.fueleconomy.gov\n\nBesides its fuel-saving prowess, the 5.3-liter V-8 is also a gutsy performer that doesn’t feel taxed in the least moving the 5,326-pound Sierra crew cab. It also emits a pleasing V-8 rumble.\n\nThe V-8 drives a four-speed automatic. Don’t scoff at the transmission’s low gear count; it’s well-matched to the V-8, and its unobtrusive shifts are a welcome quality and contribute to the truck’s overall sense of refinement. The transmission will also kick down quickly if you need to pass.\n\nThe Sierra’s brakes are less praiseworthy. They don’t have any trouble stopping this rig, but the pedal itself doesn’t offer much sensation.\n\nThe Inside\nFull-size truck cabs have made some big strides lately in terms of material quality and detailing, and the Silverado and Sierra took it to a higher level when redesigned versions debuted for the 2007 model year.\n\nThe trucks are available with two different dashboard designs. One is a more traditional arrangement and the other has a carlike design. The more upscale, carlike dash is similar to the one in GMC’s full-size Yukon SUV, and in the Sierra it gives the cabin a distinctively untrucklike look. The dash plastic has attractive graining and, on All Terrain models, is accented by brushed-silver trim. The armrests on the doors and the large center storage bin are positioned in the right place for optimal comfort.\n\nThe cabin does have its downsides, though. The buttons for the air conditioning system are excessively small considering all the space available in the middle of the dash. The steering column tilts but doesn’t telescope, and the tilt feature has predetermined notches, which prevented me from putting the wheel exactly where I wanted. The doors covering the All Terrain’s front cupholders and a small storage pocket have flimsy latches.\n\nVinyl seating surfaces are standard, but my SLT test truck came equipped with leather seats finished in a two-tone color scheme that’s part of the All Terrain package for this trim level (SLE2 All Terrain trucks get black cloth seats). Though the cushioning in the leather front bucket seats is on the firm side, the seats offer good support and I never stepped out of the truck feeling sore. The leather seats in SLT trucks are heated, and unlike many other heated seats you have the ability to heat both the backrest and the bottom cushion or just the backrest.\n\nThough the crew cab body style provides adequate space for adults in the rear seats, I was expecting it to be a little more spacious and comfortable; there’s good headroom, but my legs were touching the back of the front seat, and the rather upright backrest isn’t very comfortable. The cushioning is the complete opposite of the front; you sink into the cushy seats. I’m 6-foot-1, so shorter passengers may not feel as squeezed. If you’re looking for more lounging room, take a look at the Dodge Ram Mega Cab, 2009 Ford F-150 SuperCrew or Toyota Tundra CrewMax.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWhen the crew cab’s rear seats aren’t in use, it’s easy to fold them up and out of the way to use the space for carrying bags inside the cab rather than in the cargo bed. It’s as simple as lifting up on the front of the seat cushion until it’s perpendicular with the floor. There are no levers to press or latches to secure — the cushion just stays in place vertically, and it didn’t fall down when I was driving. With both portions of the 60/40-split backseat up, there’s a relatively flat floor for your belongings. Pulling down on the seat cushion makes the backseat usable again.\n\nTowing and payload figures vary by body style and drivetrain, but the four-wheel-drive crew cab Sierra I tested had a payload rating of 1,674 pounds and a towing capacity of 7,500 pounds with the 3.73 axle ratio. With the optional Max trailering package that includes a 6.0-liter V-8, however, the light-duty crew cab Sierra is rated to pull as much as 10,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Side curtain airbags are optional.\n\nBacking up a full-size truck can be challenging in tight quarters, but technology like rear parking sensors, which are optional for the Sierra, make the process a little less nerve-racking.\n\nSierra in the Market\nEven though full-size trucks still sell in large numbers, sales have slowed. Competition for the remaining buyers is only increasing, as the Ram 1500 and F-150 have both been redesigned for the 2009 model year and go on sale late this year. Toyota’s Tundra was new for 2007. This is what the Sierra is up against, and while the competition is formidable, the Sierra is well-positioned to compete.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: GMC fixed the one big area where the previous Sierra 1500 fell short (the interior), making the new 2022 model a no-excuses, fully competitive premium full-size pickup truck with some expensive high-end trims.\n\nVersus the competition: More luxurious than its Chevrolet siblings, the new Sierra 1500 handily out-luxes the Ford F-150, Nissan Titan and Toyota Tundra, but the Ram 1500 still gives it a run for its money.\n\nWhen GM redesigned its full-size pickup trucks for the 2019 model year, we were big fans of most of the changes it made: Styling was wild, capabilities were improved, and powertrains and chassis dynamics were top-notch. The interiors, however, were no better than the plastic-fantastic cabins they replaced. GM spent its money on everything but the inside and got one-upped by Ram and Ford on cabin quality and finishing touches.\n\nRelated: 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate, AT4X: Up Close\n\nNow, with the 2022 versions of GM’s big trucks, that issue has been soundly resolved. Completely new interiors have arrived for the Chevy Silverado 1500 (see our review) and the truck discussed here, the 2022 GMC Sierra 1500. Along with the Sierra’s new digs comes some new tech, some new trims, and some decided hits and misses. After spending time behind the wheel of a new ’22 Sierra, we came away mostly impressed, but also a little concerned.\n\nKeeping Familial Ties\n\nThe one area GMC really didn’t need to touch (but did anyway) was the Sierra’s exterior styling, but we ain’t mad about it. After its last big redesign, the Sierra came out looking like a more formal, more traditional model next to the Silverado’s wilder look. Both have their appeal. For 2022, the Sierra gets some mild updates to its front and rear end, with new grilles, new headlights, new LED running lights and new bumpers. The space between the ends remains the same, but there are some new wheel designs depending on trim level.\n\nThe model I tested was a new-for-2022 AT4X, which is a more luxurious upgrade to the still-available AT4 off-road variant. GMC bills the AT4X as a balanced approach to a premium off-road pickup, delivering advanced off-road tech and capability without sacrificing on-road performance, towing capability, payload rating or interior luxury.\n\nFrom the outside, the AT4X doesn’t look much different from the normal AT4, though it sports new 18-inch black wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac mud-terrain tires. It sits higher, too, thanks to its off-road suspension and has various blacked-out trim bits, including the grille and mirrors. It also features some curious choices for an off-road pickup, such as LED foglights set low and outboard in the bumper — where they’re likely to be damaged on a trail. It does make you wonder just how serious an off-road pickup this is given this styling choice. The equivalent Chevrolet, the new Silverado 1500 ZR2, also has LED foglights in its bumper, but the bumper itself is higher, has cutouts for the front wheels, and locates its lights more inboard and away from the corners. The difference suggests that the extremely expensive Sierra AT4X is more about looking off-road-capable than actually being in such environs.\n\nYet It Has Off-Road Equipment\n\nThe AT4X is equipped with all the goodies one needs to go off-road quite successfully, starting with the suspension. It uses a shared version of the Multimatic Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve dampers and off-road springs that debuted on the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2, which have since spread to the bigger trucks in the lineup. This increases suspension travel versus the standard AT4’s suspension by 50 millimeters up front and 25 millimeters in back. My time with the truck sadly did not include any serious off-roading, but I did manage to find some empty fields and gnarly rural dirt two-tracks, and I can confirm that the AT4X’s suspension is quite good out in the rough. Major washboard surfaces are barely noticeable at speed, and the truck had no problem crawling over mounds and hillocks. On the street, it provided a compliant, well-damped ride that swallowed southeastern Michigan’s cratered, potholed roads with ease. (Roads like these may actually be more reason to buy an off-road capable truck than a desire to actually go off-road.)\n\nThe AT4X powertrain is also solid. The trim level’s only engine choice is the standard 6.2-liter V-8 paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. It makes a very robust 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque — enough to get the big truck moving smartly with just a light stab of the go pedal. It’s all accompanied by a sonorous roar that no EV pickup could match with artificial noise. It burbles around town, can tow a decent-sized trailer (up to 8,900 pounds) and very much feels like a traditional big pickup in terms of capabilities and positioning.\n\nFurther qualifying the powertrain for off-road duties are front and rear electronic locking differentials — a class-exclusive feature, not counting the Silverado 1500 ZR2. The big and most notable difference between the AT4X and other pickups is its tires: Its 18-inch mud-terrain tires are knobby and definitely deliver more noise into the cabin thanks to their chunky tread pattern. They’re a bit more squirrely on dry pavement, as well, especially at highway speeds, but such is the price you pay for off-road capability that you’re not likely to use very often. The new AT4X could easily head into the muck and do well in such environments, but given the truck’s staggering price tag, you have to wonder how eager its owners will be to thrash their luxury rigs around in such places. The AT4X seems built more for captains of very specific industries (like construction company owners) — drivers more likely to use its abilities on poor terrain, build sites, logging roads and the like.\n\nStellar Interior With Buggy Electronics\n\nAnother reason you may not want to take an AT4X off-road is the risk of messing up its truly fantastic, luxurious and well-appointed interior. Who wants to get all that leather and wood actually muddy?\n\nGMC did an absolutely fantastic job revamping the dour, plasticky, low-rent interior from the previous Sierra. Prior to this model year, there was frankly little reason to spend extra money on higher-grade trims of this truck, as the materials inside weren’t much better than what you got on lesser models. Now, the Sierra starts at “nice” and climbs all the way up to “genuinely luxurious.” The AT4X is what you get when you climb the off-road style path in the Sierra trim hierarchy versus the Denali path toward outright on-road luxury. That means that along with the nice materials in the AT4X, there’s also more rugged bits and pieces that can handle some dirt. You won’t be taking a hose to the interior to wash anything out, but the thick, rubber-trimmed floormats make the cabin feel a bit more off-road-ready (even if it really isn’t).\n\nAs with the Silverado, the Sierra’s interiors are comfortable, spacious, and feature tons of head- and legroom. The truck’s dash is distinctly different from the Silverado’s; long gone are the days where the only difference was a badge on the steering wheel. There’s also far more digital presence today, with screens galore. It starts with a reconfigurable 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster with a number of different styles and themes. It continues with the enormous 13.4-inch touchscreen on the dashboard running Google’s Built-In operating system (which can be a bit buggy; more on that in a moment). To top it all off, there’s a 15-inch full-color head-up display projected above the dash that offers all kinds of information (also configurable). It’s almost screen overload, but it’s easy to use; it’s nice and clear even in bright sunlight, and it works reasonably quickly, too, with little lag.\n\nThe switch to Google Built-In for the overall operating system, however, carries some pros and cons. Yes, it does allow you to sign in with your own Google account and transfer all manner of information between your vehicle and devices, and to control various systems and apps using your phone. But it also means that many functions in the vehicle that were previously locally controlled (such as voice commands for functions like switching stations or adjusting the temperature) are also now tied into this system and thus use cloud-based processing to work. So, if you’re somewhere with little data signal, some of those systems aren’t going to work. That’s a big problem for pickup truck owners living in rural areas where cellular data networks aren’t the most reliable. It’s something we hope all automakers will realize and address — and we’re fairly confident they will once feedback starts rolling in from dissatisfied customers whose expensive pickup’s fancy voice commands won’t do what they’re supposed to do.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Updated With Even More Luxurious Trims\n2022 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali to Get Super Cruise Self-Driving System\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 GMC Sierra?\n2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2: Towing With an Off-Roader\nShop for a 2022 GMC Sierra 1500\nAffordability Is Not the Goal\n\nIf you haven’t been paying attention, pickup trucks have supplanted luxury sedans as the premium American vehicle offering over the past 20 years. I mean, how often do you see big Lincoln Continentals or Cadillac CT6s around anymore?\n\nIn those cars’ place are the GMC Sierra Denali, Chevrolet Silverado High Country, Ford F-150 Platinum, Ram 1500 Longhorn and the like. That’s why my loaded 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 AT4X’s sticker price of just a tick under $80,000 is both hard to swallow and easy to understand. Sure, you can buy a less expensive pickup, but the AT4X will be as much a luxury style statement for some buyers as it will be a functional tool. It’s like buying expensive Red Wing leather work boots you’re not likely to get muddy or expensive Patagonia outdoor gear when the regular old JCPenney stuff works just as well. It’s not “poser” equipment; the boots, gear and pickup absolutely can do all the things they’re designed to do. It’s just that, given their expense and luxury pretense, they’re less likely to ever be used for such purposes. But maybe that’s OK; we’re all allowed to have nice things.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There are minor updates and changes coming for the 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 full-size pickup truck, designed to expand the brand’s available technology to more trims. On the powertrain front, the big news is the expansion of the 10-speed automatic transmission’s availability — it’s now paired with the 5.3-liter V-8 engine as standard equipment on the Sierra AT4 and Denali, and will be included on SLE trims and above as long as four-wheel drive is also selected. Previously, you could only get the 10-speed when you ordered the top 6.2-liter V-8. If you don’t get four-wheel drive, your 5.3-liter V-8-equipped truck will still feature the eight-speed automatic transmission. GMC is also adding turbo-diesel 3.0-liter Duramax inline six-cylinder availability to the CarbonPro Edition trucks; previously, you could only get the CarbonPro with the 6.2-liter V-8.\n\nTechnology-wise, the 2020 Sierra 1500 SLT, AT4 and Denali will get available adaptive cruise control that will be able to bring the Sierra to a full stop when engaged. But the real news is the arrival of the enhanced ProGrade Trailering system, which brings 15 different available camera views to the multimedia system, including the industry-first “transparent trailer” view that essentially makes anything you’re towing disappear. The system was first shown on the soon-to-be-launched 2020 Sierra 2500/3500, which we should see later this summer.\n\nGMC is also filtering a lot of the trailer control functions down from the new heavy-duty pickups as well. The in-vehicle Trailering App in the multimedia system will allow owners to create and edit trailer profiles through the myGMC mobile device app and upload them directly to the truck, saving time on hooking up new trailers for the first time. The trailer profiles are also shareable now, so they can be sent to other trucks with the capability. The app also will send notifications for maintenance and trailer mileage. The in-Command Control System app, available through a mobile device or through the truck’s multimedia system running Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, allows even more control over the trailer itself — enabling a user to potentially activate trailer systems like air conditioning or water heaters, check holding tank levels or monitor generator fuel tank levels from the comfort of the Sierra’s cab.\n\nCosmetically, not much changes for 2020 except for an appearance update for CarbonPro Editions of the Sierra AT4 off-road pickup. In addition to the unique carbon fiber bed, the Sierra AT4 CarbonPro Edition will get a new black chrome grille surround, black exhaust tips and modified badges. It will be available only in Onyx Black, Summit White, Satin Steel Metallic and Carbon Black Metallic colors. Also, the Elevation trim level (the monochromatic one that slots between the SLE and SLT) can now be had as a crew-cab model instead of just the double dab that was offered for 2019, and the Sierra’s optional trailer tow mirrors have been redesigned.\n\nThe new 2020 GMC Sierra goes on sale in August.",

      "expert_review": "Here in truck country, loads of folks drive big pickup trucks just because they want to. Wide-open spaces and all that.\n\nSure, the gas mileage is grim and they’re hard to maneuver in Phoenix’s increasingly urban environment, but this Western tradition won’t go away until the drivers are forced, by economics, fuel scarcity or social pressure, to trade in Ole’ Bessie for a car.\n\nMeanwhile, truck people know that driving a pickup no longer means you have to rough it. Pickups can be gussied up with all the comfort and amenities of a high-end SUV or luxury car. Leather interiors, high-end audio systems, DVD players, power everything, the whole deal.\n\nThe pickup I drove, a GMC Sierra 1500 SLT Crew Cab, came with all the trimmings and a price tag to match. This brawny four-wheel-drive truck was set up for off-roading, but more than that, it was equipped as a luxurious family transport.\n\nThis way, you can hit the high country with everybody on board riding in supreme comfort, with a motor home, boat, ATV or horse trailer in tow. Around town, the cushy cabin offers all the lush features of an upscale sedan.\n\nIn 2007, General Motors reaped tons of praise for its revamped versions of the Sierra and corporate twin Chevrolet Silverado, mostly because of their much improved ride and drivability. Sure enough, despite Sierra’s mammoth size and bulk, I found the handling to be first-rate.\n\nTruck sales have been off since the downturn in construction and related trades, so GM has not found the rousing success it had hoped for with its new full-size pickups. Silverado is the top-selling vehicle in GM’s portfolio, just behind sales-leader Ford F-150, but the whole market is flat.\n\nSo for truck adherents, there are plenty of good buys out there on even the highest-end pickups.\n\nGMC Sierra 1500 SLT Crew Cab\n\nVehicle type: Five- or six-passenger four-door pickup, four-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 5.3-liter V-8, 315 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 338 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 143.5 inches.\n\nOverall length: 229.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,326 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 14 city, 19 highway.\n\nHighs: Superior drivability, interior comfort, sharp styling.\n\nLows: Short bed, mileage still paltry, pricey with options.\n\nPerformance: The 315-horsepower V-8 provides good acceleration and response, with a smooth refinement that is decidedly un-trucklike.The engine is equipped with Active Fuel Management, which deactivates four cylinders while cruising for improved fuel mileage. The system works seamlessly, though I managed only about 15 miles per gallon in a mix of urban and highway driving.\n\nDrivability: Surprisingly easy to drive, this behemoth really does handle like a passenger car, although the unladen back end gets jittery over rough surfaces, a solid reminder that this is, after all, a pickup truck. Safety features include Stabilitrac stability control and rollover mitigation, plus seat-belt pre-tensioners that also activate in a rear-end collision. The critical safety feature of side-impact-curtain airbags comes as an option rather than standard on all Sierras except the top-end Denali. Obviously, it should be standard for all.\n\nStyling: The chunky good looks of the Silverado are pretty much the same on the Sierra, aside from the GMC’s good-looking grille. Somehow, it manages to look somewhat sporty in spite of its looming size.The 5.75-foot bed length seems small.\n\nInterior: This roomy cabin is all set for a road trip or a fancy night out, with nicely tailored leather seats and a plethora of luxury features. The buttons and gauges retain their truckiness, feeling solid and easy to use.\n\nBottom line: A well-engineered and luxurious pickup, although the nearly $45,000 final price had me wondering.\n\nBase price: $37,850.\n\nPrice as tested: $44,755.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nNavigation, $2,250.\n\nAll-terrain package, including Z71 off-road group, Rancho shocks, 18-inch alloy wheels, heavy-duty towing and leather interior trim, $2,195.\n\nSLT preferred package, including remote starting, audio upgrade with six-CD player and MP3 format, adjustable pedals, park assist, $1,045.\n\nSide-curtain airbags, $395.\n\nEZ lift locking tailgate, $95.\n\nShipping, $825.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nGMC updated its complete line of full-size Sierra pickup trucks for the 2003 model year and incorporated a new electrical architecture. While this General Motors division positions its trucks as “professional grade,” the similar Chevrolet Silverado ranks as the high-volume member of the duo.\n\nSierras are available in half-ton 1500, three-quarter-ton 2500HD and one-ton 3500 forms. No regular 2500 series exists, but a 1500HD is offered. Whereas the higher-rated models provide an increased level of hauling and towing capabilities, the 1500 series offers editions that aren’t available in the others, like the Sierra Denali luxury pickup.\n\nFor 2006, GMC’s Sierra Hybrid expands to nationwide availability; it previously was offered only in select markets. Though its electrical motor does not actually propel the vehicle, GMC still classifies it as a hybrid.\n(Skip to details on the: Sierra Hybrid | 2500HD | 3500)\n\nThe Sierra Denali is a luxury pickup with a 345-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8; permanent all-wheel drive; and a specially tuned suspension. Chevrolet doesn’t offer an equivalent to the Sierra Denali, and GMC offers no equivalent to the high-performance Chevrolet Silverado SS. Offered as a Crew Cab rather than an extended-cab truck, the Denali features leather seats and can be fitted with a sunroof and 20-inch wheels.\n\nFor 2006, several new packages, trims and configurations are available — most notably a new base-model 1500 SL Crew Cab at a lower price than the 2005 base SLE Crew Cab. Also, the optional 6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8 on Sierra 2500HD and 3500 models gets more power, and a new six-speed-automatic transmission replaces the previous five-speed in models equipped with this engine.\n\nExterior\nLight-duty Sierra styling is similar to the heavy-duty models. The Terra4 concept truck inspired the Sierra 1500’s front end. Sierras differ from Silverados mainly in the front, which is dominated by a bolder grille and a prominent red GMC badge.\n\nRegular-cab, extended-cab and Crew Cab models are offered. Crew Cab trucks have four conventional front-hinged doors. Extended-cab trucks have two front doors and a pair of narrow back doors that open toward the rear and can’t be opened unless the front doors are open. The 1500HD is available only in Crew Cab form. Denalis have chrome running boards and a unique front fascia.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab models seat either three occupants on a bench or two in twin buckets, while extended-cab pickups have a rear bench seat and can carry five or six people. Models with bucket seats have a standard center console that flows up into the instrument panel. Optional uplevel mirrors have a power-folding feature for parking in narrow spaces. For 2006, available camper mirrors offer manually extendable surfaces for increased visibility when towing a camper or trailer.\n\nXM Satellite Radio is available. Denali and SLT models have a six-CD changer. Crew Cab trucks can be equipped with a DVD-based entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe engine choices for the Sierra 1500 include one V-6 and a selection of V-8s. A 195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6; a 285-hp, 4.8-liter V-8; and a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 are offered. A version of the 5.3-liter V-8 can run on gasoline or E85, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. An aluminum variant of the 5.3-liter V-8 produces 310 hp. The Denali is fitted with a 345-hp, 6.0-liter V-8, while the 1500HD is powered by a 300-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. Available transmissions include a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic.\n\nThree four-wheel-drive systems are available. Insta-Trac is an on-demand system with a floor-mounted transfer case; it is available on base models. Autotrac is an automatically engaging system that transfers power to the front wheels, as needed, on slippery surfaces; this system can be installed on SLE and SLT trim levels. The Sierra Denali is equipped with full-time all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nDaytime running lights and antilock brakes are standard. GM’s OnStar communication system is available on some models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLike the Silverado, GMC’s Sierra 1500 can be equipped with simple features for basic work duty or it can be fully decked out with extras to make it resemble a luxury vehicle. High-end models are quite appealing for regular driving. Though the Sierra certainly isn’t carlike, drivers may occasionally forget they’re inside a truck.\n\nThe Sierra 1500 exhibits above-average quietness. Even though the ride isn’t cushiony, a luxury edition is about as smooth on pavement as you’re likely to find in a pickup. The 5.3-liter V-8 delivers plenty of zip, and it’s matched to a well-behaved and quick-responding automatic transmission.\n\nBecause of their manageable size, these pickups are relatively easy to judge while parking, and climbing aboard a four-wheel-drive model isn’t an arduous task.�\n\nSierra Hybrid\nLate in the 2004 model year, GMC launched a Sierra Hybrid pickup. At the same time, Chevrolet introduced a closely related Silverado Hybrid. Offered initially to fleet buyers, each became available to retail customers in select states in 2005. The Sierra Hybrid will be available nationwide for 2006.\n\nGM claims the Sierra Hybrid achieves up to a 10-percent fuel-economy improvement due to the workings of the compact 14-kilowatt starter-generator. This starter-generator permits the Sierra Hybrid to automatically stop and restart its gasoline engine at stoplights or for other temporary halts. It also provides regenerative braking while the truck is coasting. Unlike other hybrid models on the market, the electric motor doesn’t actually propel the vehicle.\n\nThe 5.3-liter V-8 has the same output ratings as the conventional version: 295 hp and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Whenever the engine shuts itself off, which occurs as promised, it’s difficult to discern that anything unusual has happened. The system also serves as a mobile power-generating station. There are 120-volt power outlets located under the rear seat and in the pickup bed.\n\nAccording to estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency, these pickups can achieve 17 – 18 mpg in the city and 19 – 21 mpg for highway driving, which amounts to a 2 mpg improvement in city driving and a 0 to 1 mpg gain on the highway when compared with equivalent models. Back to top�\n\n2500HD\nSierra 2500HD trucks come in Work Truck, base, SLE and upscale SLT trim levels. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a 7-inch screen and wireless headphones is available for Crew Cab models.\n\nExtended cabs have two front doors and a pair of narrow back doors that open toward the rear, but they can’t be opened unless the front doors are open. Crew Cab models have four conventional doors that open toward the front, and they can seat up to six occupants when properly equipped. Regular-cab models are also available.\n\nThe standard 6.0-liter V-8 produces 300 hp and 360 pounds-feet of torque, while an available big-block 8.1-liter V-8 churns out 330 hp and 450 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines can team with either a manual or automatic transmission. The optional 6.6-liter Duramax turbo-diesel V-8 has been extensively revised for 2006 and now generates 360 hp and 650 pounds-feet of torque when mated with a new six-speed-automatic transmission. Insta-Trac part-time four-wheel drive features a floor-mounted transfer case. Back to top�\n\n3500\nGMC’s heavy-duty one-ton 3500 series comes in Work Truck, base, SLE and upscale SLT trim levels, with a choice of three cab styles. Some Sierra 3500 trucks have two pairs of rear wheels.\n\nSierra 3500 pickups have a standard 6.0-liter V-8 that produces 300 hp and 360 pounds-feet of torque, while GMC’s big-block 8.1-liter V-8 makes 330 hp and 450 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines will be available with either a manual or automatic transmission. An extensively revised 6.6-liter Duramax turbo-diesel V-8 will be available in mid-2006. It generates 360 hp and 650 pounds-feet of torque when mated with a new six-speed-automatic transmission. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Personally, I feel kind of bad about the GMC Sierra full-size pickup.\n\nNo, not because it’s a bad truck. Quite the contrary.\n\nWhat bothers me is that its close cousin, the Chevrolet Silverado, seems to get the lion’s share of attention. Is it just my imagination, or do most of the TV commercials, roadway billboards and auto magazine ads laud the Silverado?\n\nIn contrast, the GMC Sierra pickup seems to get the leftovers.\n\nThat’s a shame because my week spent in the 2007 Sierra 1500 Extended Cab 4WD SLE1 Standard Box (say that three times fast) felt more like the main course.\n\nPerhaps most significant, the tested Sierra shaped up as a worthy competitor with the all-new 2007 Toyota Tundra, which also has benefitted from a monster multimedia publicity campaign.\n\nI tested the Sierra the same week as the ’07 Toyota Tundra 4X2 SR5 Double Cab, and the GMC product compared favorably with the Japanese automaker’s pickup in virtually every way.\n\nFor example, the Sierra’s ride was remarkably smooth for a vehicle topping 5,000 pounds. Acceleration from the tester’s 5.3-liter, 295-horsepower V-8 was decidedly robust, and the power curve held up well even on steep inclines.\n\nOnly the nastiest road bumps made their presence felt in the Sierra cabin. Wind and road noise also had a tough time getting inside.\n\nWhen the big truck was in cruise control on a stretch of flatland interstate, it had all the road manners of a Cadillac CTS sedan. Kudos to GM’s ride engineers on all counts.\n\nFuel economy on the tester, however, was an absolutely forgettable 16 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the open road. The tester was a flex-fuel truck — meaning it could be filled with the E85 gasoline-ethanol blend — but even that doesn’t do a lot for mileage.\n\nParking the Sierra next to the Tundra brought another surprise. While there was a difference in pickup configurations, I expected the Tundra to dwarf the Sierra. Not so.\n\nIn truth, the two trucks were nearly mirror images. A check of the respective specification sheets showed the Tundra’s length at 228.7 inches, a mere 1.3 inches longer than the Sierra. The Tundra’s wheelbase was 145.7 inches; the Sierra’s just a nose behind at 143.5 inches.\n\nThese extra-large measurements are good news for Sierra extended cab buyers who envision plentiful hauling in the truck’s ample cargo bed. As for towing, the tester could hitch up to 8,700 pounds. Move up to GM’s 6-liter V-8 engine, and the same truck with two-wheel drive can pull nearly 10,500 pounds.\n\nLargeness can have its drawbacks, however.\n\nThe Sierra was an absolute bear to park in tight lots. If you’re heading to the local retail strip, it’s probably a good idea to find an isolated parking spot and walk those few extra yards to the front door.\n\nStepping up into the cab of the tested Sierra made me feel small, something I’m not accustomed to as a six-footer. (Six stout adults would be most comfortable in this GMC.)\n\nLikewise, the big buttons on the truck’s dash and center stack of controls reminded me of when I was 6 years old, when every button and dial in a car seemed oversized.\n\nAnother plus: The Sierra had styling cues that made it stand out as a GMC product, including giant-size “GMC” lettering on the front grille. Take that, Silverado.\n\nIf you can’t find what you want on a GMC Sierra pickup, better give up. The Sierra 1500 Extended Cab 4WD version comes in 12 trim levels.\n\nAs for options, the tester offered a blizzard of choices, including such goodies as an off-road/skid-plate package, adjustable pedals, park-assist, remote start-up system and a transmission-cooling system.\n\nJust be careful when you’re pondering those add-ons. The extras and a $900 destination charge on the tester boosted the truck’s bottom-line sticker price more than $6,000 above the manufacturer’s suggested retail of $29,600.\n\nOverall, the GMC Sierra is a big, beefy player in a segment that respects those qualities. It’s more geared to rural/ranch environments, but it could do duty as a corporate cowboy’s transporter.\n\nJust be sure to give it plenty of room when parking.\n\nAnd, hey GM, how about getting some more attention for this satisfying Sierra?\n\n2007 GMC Sierra at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2007 GMC Sierra 1500 Extended Cab 4WD SLE1 Standard Box Vehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door, four-wheel-drive, full-size pickup truck Base price: $29,600 (as tested, $35,635) Engine: 5.3-liter flexible-fuel V-8 with 295 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute and 335 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm EPA fuel economy: 16 miles per gallon city; 20 mpg highway (regular unleaded; also takes E85 gas-ethanol blend) Transmission: Four-speed automatic with overdrive Steering: Power-assisted recirculating-ball type Brakes: Power-assisted four-wheel discs with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement feature Suspension: Independent, coil-over-shock type on front; live, multi-leaf on rear Fuel tank: 26 gallons Passenger volume: 122 cubic feet (estimated) Maximum cargo volume: 56.9 cubic feet Curb weight: 5,200 pounds (estimated) Height: 73.9 inche Length: 227.4 inches",
