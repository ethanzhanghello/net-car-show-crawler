      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln’s rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan earned a substantial reworking for the 2003 model year. Flaunting a new stand-up hood ornament, the four-door Town Car’s appearance grew noticeably more formal. Changes for 2008 are limited to the loss of trim levels and the optional navigation system.\n\nLincoln has removed the Designer and Signature trims, leaving the Signature Limited and Signature L. The Signature L sedan is 6 inches longer than its mates, both overall and in wheelbase length. Two additional series are available for limousine and livery use.\n\nThe Town Car’s wheel selection includes machined-aluminum units with 10 spokes, as well as an 18-spoke chromed-aluminum wheel. There are front crash-severity sensors, and the front passenger seat has occupant-weight and seat-track-position sensors.\n\nExterior\nThe Town Car’s formal appearance leads off with a chrome vertical-bar grille that’s flanked by quad-beam halogen headlights. A stand-up ornament is mounted at the front of the hood. High-intensity-discharge headlights are optional. Large taillamps bring up the rear.\n\nStandard models are 215.4 inches long overall on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, while the extended-length L sedans measure 221.4 inches long overall with a 123.7-inch wheelbase. All models have 17-inch tires. Whitewall tires, two-tone paint and a powered glass moonroof are optional.\n\nInterior\nProgrammable adjustable pedals, keyless entry and dual-zone automatic climate control are standard for 2008.\n\nAlso standard are eight-way power seats for the driver and outboard front passenger, power lumbar support and extended rear parking assist. Heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inserts are standard.\n\nEquipped with a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, the Town Car seats up to six occupants. The seats are trimmed in premium leather. Panels with burl walnut applique decorate the instrument panel and doors, and an analog clock is installed.\n\nThe Town Car features leather seating surfaces. The extended-length Signature L has heated rear seats, four-way rear head restraints, a folding rear armrest, remote audio and climate controls, and rear-located seat position controls for the outboard front passenger seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Town Car’s 4.6-liter V-8 develops 239 horsepower and 287 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission available. All-speed traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Town Car yields a surprisingly appealing driving experience, offering a secure, confident sensation and good connection with the road.\n\nTown Cars are exceptionally stable on the expressway and especially easy to drive; they deliver a smooth yet controlled ride. The sedan is very quiet, but you can hear the engine. Braking is less pleasing because the pedal may exhibit a long dead spot before the brakes become effective.\n\nInterior space is abundant, and rear legroom in the extended-length L sedan is massive. The seat bottoms are fairly long and well-cushioned, but support could be better.",

      "expert_review": "It was late when I climbed aboard the Lincoln Town Car, tired and gloomily anticipating a 130-mile solo drive back to Phoenix.\n\nI stretched out in the leather seat, cued up a CD and wheeled the massive white cruiser out of the parking lot.\n\nNow, I have to admit, I’m not a fan of these big luxo-barges. They seem anachronistic, wasteful and somehow indecent.\n\nBut the new Town Car is a heckuva lot sleeker and drives a whole lot better than the previous generation. No longer is it so squared off, or burdened with a pretentious formal roof line or velvet boudoir interior.\n\nAnd no longer does it drive like the Queen Mary. Though hardly what you’d call sporting, this “full-size luxury car” now rides on a suspension that’s much better controlled, still soft, but less likely to heave and sway.\n\nThe steering’s quicker, the brakes are better, and the whole package feels tighter and better put together.\n\nThe first part of my trip was mostly over a desert road, straight as an arrow, but with deep undulations through the washes. The 2-ton Town Car rushed quietly through the darkness, unfazed by road irregularities or the sudden drops and rises.\n\nI felt snug and secure on my leather throne, with plenty of headroom, shoulder room and, most importantly, legroom for my lanky self. The driver’s seat is soft and not real supportive on turns, but as comfortable as an easy chair. The split-bench front seats are a lot better than those ersatz living-room sofas from the old Town Cars.\n\nOne of the top draws of this big craft is the space within. The new version has an impressive level of comfort for six, with a back seat styled for a busy executive being chauffeured to the next board meeting.\n\nOnce the American driving landscape was loaded with full-size, rear-wheel-drive cars. But now, the Town Car and its corporate siblings, Ford Crown Victoria and Lincoln Grand Marquis, are the last of the breed body-on-frame construction, live rear axle, the way we used to build ’em.\n\nAs such, these cars attract a cadre of mature drivers who favor the traditional feel of a big American car. Only better.\n\nTrouble is, Lincoln’s clientele is rapidly aging, with the average Town Car buyers well into their 60s. Lincoln would love to attract some less-geriatric drivers to the fold.\n\nLincoln Navigator, the luxury sport-ute behemoth based on the Ford Expedition, has helped bring in a younger crowd this year and pushed Lincoln sales way up the chart. Next year, Lincoln benefits from Ford’s ownership of Jaguar, getting two sporty midsize sedans with input from the British marque.\n\nFor the Town Car, the rounded, sportier styling and improved driveability is directed at younger drivers, while trying not to scare away the traditional buyers. For instance, check out all that chrome, a definite ’50s throwback.\n\nThe roof is rounded into a coupelike style, which looks from the outside as if it would compromise headroom in the back. That’s deceiving, becau se even an NBA player should be able to sit back there in regal comfort.\n\nThe front end has a refined version of Lincoln’s traditional formal grille, but now it’s angled lower and appears more aggressive.\n\nThe Town Car is most distinctive from the rear, where its rounded trunk lid and enormous taillights make it look something like a newer Bentley. Reactions were mixed, but I think this look will sell and be copied by others.\n\nThe trunk space is enormous, but it’s in the shape of a deep basin, lacking the practical advantages of a broad, flat trunk.\n\nOur test car was a Cartier Edition, slathered with luxury appointments, leather, chrome bits and plastic wood trim. Otherwise, the interior is pretty straightforward, maybe a bit boring for such a high-end car.\n\nThis model also has the more powerful V-8, with 10 percent more horsepower than the base Executive model. Even so, acceleration is not terribly brisk, the 220 ponies working hard to haul the 4,000-pound car up to spe ed. But the engine is very smooth and quiet, in keeping with the Town Car’s character.\n\nAside from the Cartier package, another optional upgrade is the Signature Touring Sedan, which offers tighter suspension and improved handling, along with the higher-output engine. According to other media reports, this is a worthwhile addition that should appeal to a younger crop of drivers.\n\nAnyone considering the Town Car might check out the Grand Marquis, basically the same car with a similar level of appointments, but significantly less costly.\n\nOn the freeway between Tucson and Phoenix, the miles rolled by quickly, the Town Car quietly doing its job at 75-plus miles per hour, the excellent stereo reeling through the CDs. I enjoyed the solid ride, especially when passing phalanxes of semis. Wind noise was absent, and only faint tire rumble intruded on the climate-controlled cabin.\n\nAside from touring Manhattan, this is the kind of driving in which the Town Car excels, where its weight and driving ease are at their best.\n\nI arrived home around midnight, feeling pretty mellow. The Town Car is a grand touring car in the American tradition – maybe not my style, but definitely well-appreciated on this late-night voyage.\n\n1998 Lincoln Town Car\n\nVehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door sedan, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "If ever there was a car that totally sabotages Lincoln’s efforts at wooing younger buyers, it’s this one.\n\nThis land yacht is about as hip as chest-high white polyester slacks.\n\nThe redesign of the Town Car, first seen two years ago, didn’t help a lot. With its rounded flanks, the car looks even larger than it is, with a bulbous butt that lacks the quiet sophistication of the previous design. It looks especially bad in light colors, with the refrigerator-white test car looking like it was ready for service at the rental car counter.\n\nIt’s not that the image of the Town Car offends me.\n\nBig American land yachts encrusted with chrome can be hip and stylish. For proof of this, look no further than the Chrysler Concorde/LHS/300M.\n\nWhile the Town Car tries too hard to be something, the result is a disappointing one. Certainly the Continental, not a whole lot smaller than this car, is much more successful in carrying a styling direction for Lincoln.\n\nOf course, you wouldn’t mind the looks as much if the Town Car was a real revelation to drive. It is and isn’t.\n\nIf you purchase any series — base Executive, mid-level Signature Series or top-of the-line Cartier, you’ll get the traditional floaty boat, with the all-ashore-that’s-going-ashore handling.\n\nLincoln does offer a Touring Sedan package on the mid-level Signature series. It features larger tires, a stiffer suspension, dual exhausts, monochrome paint treatment and minor interior trim variation. While the stiffer suspension firms up the handling enough to get this whale to Watusi, it doesn’t do it enough to eliminate front-end float. It also doesn’t help the power-numbed steering. Yet this car does handle a whole lot better than previous Town Cars, so having a little fun behind the wheel is possible.\n\nThe problem is that the car fails to telegraph any indication of the rear coming loose until after it’s loose. And it’s easy to do so with the Touring Sedan, despite the presence of anti-lock brakes and traction control. Furthermore, this car needs lots of little corrections to keep it pointed straight down the highway.\n\nCars this big can be fun to drive, just try out a Jaguar XJ6L or a BMW 740IL, two that come close to matching the Town Car’s girth. So, it’s not impossible to dial back a bit more of the numbness.\n\nAnd Ford can do better. The Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, with which the Lincoln shares its underpinnings and engine, seem to handle the task with more poise.\n\nThe engine these three cars share is a 4.6-liter single-overhead-cam V-8 that pumps out 205 horsepower. Opting for the Touring Sedan package yields dual exhaust and 220 horsepower. Being a luxury car, you’d expect more power than this — effortless, sparkling acceleration. But the Town Car, while yielding a respectable 18 mpg in mixed driving, is almost underpowered. While it reaches 60 mph in under 10 seconds, this is stately cruising at best. The four-speed automatic tended to hesitate before downshifting.\n\nOkay, so Town Car buyers aren’t burning up the road, but they are entitled to at least a hefty amount of luxury gear. But the Town Car isn’t as luxurious as you might expect. While it has the requisite power trappings, it doesn’t have some features available on other cars. There’s no dual climate control up front, even as an option. The express-down window is express-down only on the driver’s window and it has no express-up.\n\nFeatures like a power pull-down trunk and keypad entry under the door handles, available on previous models, are no longer available on the Town Car (despite the presence of keypads on the cheaper Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis.)\n\nThe odd shape of the trunk continues, with a deep center well that isn’t as big as it looks. There’s no extra tool kit or cargo net as in competitors’ cars. A trunk-mounted CD-changer is an option. So is a full-si zed spare tire.\n\nInterior appointments are of average quality, but this just doesn’t feel like a luxury car. Leather is used only on the seating surface; the rest is expertly matched vinyl. The back of the front seats have shallow pockets trimmed with a hard plastic panel. Actually hard plastic shows up in too many places inside this car.\n\nThe seats were comfortable, if flat. I defy anyone over five-feet-tall to find any comfort in the center front seat position. The rear seat is comfortable, if a bit short. Headroom with the power sunroof seemed a little scarce. The front driver’s seatback seemed too reclined, even at full upright position. Leg room all around is not as generous as it should be considering the external dimensions of the car.\n\nIf I’ve been a bit harsh on this car, it’s just that it isn’t really strong in any area, be it styling, engine power, features or lust factor. There’s nothing here that can’t be had for almost half the price — from a Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis.\n\nAt the very least, Ford should equip this car with the double-overhead-cam 4.6-liter engine, as it does with the smaller Continental. Buyers shelling out this much money deserve it.\n\nBut the availability of a Hearse Package and a Limousine Package reveals this car’s true intent.\n\nHow sad.\n\nHaving grown up riding in the big powerful Lincolns of the ’60s, with clean, lean, good looks, this car seems a mediocre substitute.\n\nFord is capable of better.\n\nStart with the name. Get rid of it. A Town Car traditionally was a car that had a chauffeur up front while the owner rode in the back. Given some of the handling of this car, maybe that’s the intent.\n\nThen give it lots of power and knockout styling. Don’t let the accountants get a hold of the car.\n\nIt’s okay if it is big. Just make it get out of its own way. Then maybe, I’ll want to drive it.\n\n>> 2000 Lincoln Town Car\n\nVehicle type: Full-size rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan.\nEngine: 4.6-liter SOHC V-8\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\nWheelbase: 117.7 inches\nLength: 215.3 inches\nWeight: 4,075 pounds\nCargo volume: 20.6 cubic feet\nTires: P223/60R16\nBase price: $40,630\nEPA rating: 17 city, 24 highway\nTest mileage 18 mpg\nFuel type: regular\n>>",

      "expert_review": "In town. Out of town. One jet. One prop job. Two bags of pretzels. O’Hare and the people mover. Too much mail. Too many phone calls. Finally Friday. Endof a long week. Jump in the test car and head home.\n\nAt last, peace and contentment as the ’93 Lincoln Town Car moves along the expressway. Comfort, quiet and a suspension tuned to cushion you from every tar mark in the road. It’s as if this hunk of metal were floating 2 inches offthe pavement.\n\nCome to think of it, once the tensions of the week had drained away, that soft, cushy, floating suspension became somewhat irritating. Too soft and too cushy. You don’t want to be jostled and jarred every time you drive over an asphalt cavity, but you want to have some feel of pavement underneath. You’re never too old for a security blanket.\n\nIf Lincoln had been reading the tea leaves, it would have realized that theluxury cars attracting the most attention are those geared for performance: the Cadillac Seville STS, the Infiniti J30, the Lexus GS300, cars loaded with all the creature comforts but equipped with engines and transmissions and especially suspensions that permit aggressive driving.\n\nThe Lincoln Town Car suspension seems to be designed to satisfy those suffering from hemorrhoids. What was odd was that our car came with a handlingsuspension package ($278). Hmm. How soft could the base suspension be if pillows cost an extra $278?\n\nThe Town Car is powered by Ford’s single-overhead-cam, 16-valve, 190-horsepower version of its 32-valve, 280-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 in the Mark VIII. Give it credit for smoothness and quiet, but naturally it doesn’t have the pep of the 32-valve, considering the poundage it is required to move.A couple times at hard acceleration the engine seemed to hesitate a fraction of a second, as if pausing for an instant to take a gulp of oxygen before resuming the race.\n\nThe single-overhead-cam 4.6 is rated at 18 m.p.g. city/26 highway.\n\nIn addition to sporting all the creature comforts in terms of standard power equipment, the Town Car focuses on safety. Driver- and passenger-side air bags are standard, along with four-wheel anti-lock brakes. To silence critics who complain that seat belts ride against neck, chin or cheek and are too uncomfortable to use, the Town Car features sliding belt adjusters in the door pillars.\n\nThe Town Car is designed to provide occupants quiet, comfortable, casual long-distance motoring to the vacation retreat so that you’re well-rested onceyou arrive-safely.\n\nKudos to the engineers and stylists for adding driver and front-seat passenger fold-down center armrests. But how about replacing that stiff nylon thread on the armrest tops with something softer? Each armrest also houses a foldout cupholder, which, of course, earns the designers extra credit. Buttonsin the center of the dash allow you to activate the rear-window defroster and open the gas-tank filler door easily.\n\nThe Town Car interior is simple and doesn’t overwhelm you with gadgets. Everything is within easy sight and reach. There’s nothing so confusing you have to pause and ask, “Where is it?” or, “How do you use it?”\n\nIn further paying attention to detail, Ford has positioned an arrow along the instrument-panel fuel gauge to let you know on which side the fuel-filler door is, making for easier entry at the filling station.\n\nConsidering such care for the consumer, we have to wonder who dropped the ball in designing the outside rearview mirrors. The dual power mirrors are tiny and provide awkward angles for the motorist. Where is that car that was behind us only a minute ago now that we want to pull out to pass?\n\nAll that luxury, yet the mirrors were shortchanged.\n\nIf we could make a couple other changes, one would be to increase trunk height a good 2 inches. For years Ford Motor Co. cars featured those intolerable deep-dish design circular trunk holds that we re ideal for carryinginflated inner tubes but couldn’t handle anything square or rectangular. The Town Car has a flat floor that can accommodate square or rectangular packages-but not very many.\n\nThe other change would be to widen the accelerator pedal and attach a less slippery surface to it. On a couple occasions our foot slipped off, hardly a confidence builder.\n\nThe 1993 Town Car Signature Series we tested has a base price of $35,700. Standard equipment includes air conditioning; power, anti-lock brakes; power steering; cruise control; tilt steering; 15-inch, steel-belted radial tires, power windows; remote-control deck-lid release; rear-window defroster; power door locks; tinted glass; remote, keyless entry system (push buttons on the key fob to lock/unlock the doors); color-keyed bumpers and bodyside moldings; electronic digital clock; front and rear floor mats; AM/FM stereo with cassette player and power antenna; cloth seats; leather-wrapped steering wheel; and dual coverage sunvisors (two visors on each side, to provide side- and front-window protection).\n\nOptions on the test car included a power moonroof at $1,550, alarm at $295,memory seats at $548, traction assist at $222, automatic dimming mirror at $111, leather seats at $570, JBL audio system at $576 and trunk-mounted compact-disc player/changer at $833.\n\nOne option done away with for 1993 is the Insta-Clear windshield, which removed ice or snow in seconds but gave the glass a pinkish-mauve appearance that annoyed many.\n\nWith a $625 freight charge, the Town Car stickered at $41,308, which puts it in the same price range as the Cadillac Seville STS. The Town Car is aimed toward older drivers looking for rest, the STS toward younger motorists who are restless.",

      "expert_review": "IT WOULD BE the perfect Republican car, except that it has bothsoul and passion. Instead, it’s a car for Democrats who are out ofoffice, but not out of cash and panache.\n\nHave you recently been told to get out of Washington? This is the wayto go — behind the wheel, or in the back seat of a 1995 Lincoln TownCar, Cartier Designer Series.\n\nYour mode of departure is your business, of course. The Town CarCartier is big enough to accommodate anything. And it’s so fine, hey,you can cop an attitude: “Yo, taxpayers! Money talks and rhetoric walks,and we ain’t walkin’.”\n\nYes sir! You can leave with either your head or your feet up in thenew Town Car Cartier, and be comfortable, to boot.\n\nWhat we have here is what poet and author Langston Hughes once called”joy through rejuvenation”: fine, sculpted, supple leather seats thattreat your back and butt like royalty; a splendidly crafted cabinreminiscent of the most expensive suites in the Willard Hotel; a panoplyof power options so dedicated to delivering convenience, they would putany congressional staff to shame.\n\nMoreover, the Town Car Cartier has something you never had inWashington — security. Nobody, but nobody can ever vote you out of thisone.\n\nBackground: The Town Car wasn’t always this grand. When it wasintroduced in the fall of 1979 as a 1980 Lincoln Continental, it was abig, wide work of chrome-laden ugliness — a car so bereft of taste, itbelonged in the Automotive Hall of Shame.\n\nIndeed, if you can believe it, that gargantuan, rear-wheel-driveLincoln once was sold as a two-door coupe, which even the marketingpeople at Ford Motor Co. found embarrassing. They tried to cover up theerror by calling the car a “two-door sedan.”\n\nFord added two more doors in 1982, a year after it added the Town Carname. With the exception of a few tweaks and fixes, not much changeduntil 1990 when, with the help of computer-assisted design, Ford coveredthat 1979/1980 platform with entirely new sheet metal.\n\nThe same platform — the basic under-structure of the car — remainsfor 1995. And the body remains pretty much the way it was in 1990, withthe exceptions of a new grille, new front and rear body fascias, newheadlamps and tail lamps and the welcome elimination of those verticaldivision bars in the rear windows.\n\nBut, the interior! My goodness! The interior is radically different,with an elegantly contoured instrument panel, sensibly placed andtastefully presented gauges and dials, and fabrics and materials thatrival anything found in Rolls-Royce. It’s a knockout, I tell ya.\n\nPractically everything on the Town Car Cartier is standard, includingdual front air bags; a battery saver that shuts off lamps 10 minutesafter they are left on inadvertently; a steering-control device thatallows you to determine how hard you want to work at the wheel; tractioncontrol; power four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock backup;electronically controlled, four-speed automa tic transmission; and a4.6-liter V-8 rated 210 horsepower at 4,250 rpm, with maximum torque setat 270 pound-feet at 3,250 rpm.\n\nComplaints: I have no problems with this car. In fact, if I everget the chance to bail out of a job in a golden parachute, I’d want onewaiting for me in the drop zone.\n\nPraise: Just an all-around fine automobile. Simply splendid onlong trips.\n\nHead-turning quotient: A thing of interior beauty. Outside ain’tbad, either.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Ah, make that “glide,acceleration and handling.” A triumvirate of excellence. A cruise-mobilepar excellence. Hot-rodders will hate it. But the Town Car Cartier wasnever intended for them. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: About 23 per gallon in the road test, running mostlyhighway with two occupants and light cargo. Fuel capacity is 20 gallons,which gets you an estimated cruising range of 440 miles on the usablevolume of regular unleaded.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and compact disc, JBL AudioSystem with digital signal processing. Excellent.\n\nPrice: Whoa! The base price, for the Town Car Cartier without thefew available options, is $41,200. Estimated dealer invoice on the basemodel is $36,000. Price as tested is $44,555, including $2,730 inoptions such as the power sunroof, and a $625 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with any full-size luxury sedan,including the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln’s rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan earned a substantial reworking for the 2003 model year. Flaunting a new stand-up hood ornament, the four-door Town Car’s appearance grew noticeably more formal.\n\nModel designations have changed for 2005. The previous Ultimate models have been discontinued, but new Signature Limited and Signature L models are available. The Signature L sedan has a longer wheelbase and is 5.2 inches longer overall than its mates. Many of the extended-length editions go to limousine operators.\n\nThe optional navigation system offered this year incorporates new THX-certified audio and satellite radio compatibility. Sirius Satellite Radio is available as a dealer-installed option. New front crash-severity sensors have been installed, and the front passenger seat gets occupant weight and seat track position sensors.\n\nExterior\nThe Town Car’s formal appearance leads off with a chrome vertical-bar grille that’s flanked by quad-beam halogen headlights. A stand-up ornament is mounted at the front of the hood. High-intensity-discharge headlights are optional on uplevel models. Large taillamps bring up the rear of the sedan.\n\nStandard models are 216.2 inches long overall on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, while the extended-length L sedans measure 221.4 inches long overall with a 123.7-inch wheelbase. All models have 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels. A powered glass moonroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nEquipped with a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, the Town Car seats up to six occupants. The seats are trimmed in premium leather. Panels with burl walnut applique decorate the instrument panel and doors, and an elegant analog clock is installed. Heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inserts are standard in the Signature Limited model.\n\nStandard equipment includes eight-way power seats for the driver and outboard front passenger, power lumbar support, dual-zone automatic climate control and power-adjustable pedals. The extended-length Signature L sedan has heated rear seats, a folding rear armrest, remote audio and climate controls, and rear-located controls for the outboard front passenger seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Town Car’s 4.6-liter V-8 develops 239 horsepower and 287 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission available.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCurrent models deliver a more secure, confident sensation than pre-2003 Town Cars by offering a greater connection with the road. This sedan yields a surprisingly appealing driving experience.\n\nThe Town Car is exceptionally stable on the expressway and is especially easy to drive; it has a smooth yet controlled ride. The sedan is very quiet, but you can hear the engine. Braking is less pleasing as the pedal may exhibit a long dead spot before the brakes become effective.\n\nThe seat bottoms are fairly long and well cushioned, but support could be better. Interior space is abundant, and rear legroom in the extended-length L sedan is massive.",

      "expert_review": "The Lincoln Town Car is a survivor.\n\nNow that Cadillac has thrown the last spade of dirt on its rear-drive Brougham, Lincoln-Mercury’s 1997 Town Car is the last of the big, rear-drive luxury American sedans. It now is the largest American-built production four-door, being surpassed in size only by stretch limousines.\n\nThe ’97 Town Car, as with its predecessors, is a story of evolution, not revolution. It takes a practiced eye to distinguish prior models from the present one. Changes have been more mechanical, and in comfort and convenience, than in appearance.\n\nThe ’97 Town Car continues to be an elegant and majestic motor vehicle, a fitting representative of Lincoln’s slogan, “What a luxury car should be.”\n\nIn a time when unibody (the body is the chassis) construction is being embraced by American auto manufacturers with almost religious fervor, the Town Car retains the time-tested chassis design of body on frame.\n\nThis construction principle promotes quiet operation and fewer vibrations from uneven road surfaces.\n\nThe Town Car offers that so-called boulevard ride even on lousy pavement. Slower-rate front coil springs and nitrogen gas-pressured hydraulic shocks front and rear let the suspension system slide over bumps and ridges in the road.\n\nThe rear suspension is a four-bar link system that employs self-leveling air springs on the rear axle. It all lets the suspension absorb vibration rather than transferring it to the passenger compartment.\n\nFor the handling purists who think everything should be able to take a corner in a four-wheel drift, there is a ride control package. It won’t make the car a road racer, but it does firm up the ride a bit.\n\nThe sedan has a touch of majestic size about it, courtesy of 117.4 inches of wheelbase and 218.9 inches of overall length. This length is matched only by the Rolls-Royce Park Ward Touring Limousine, providing you want to consider that model as a production automobile.\n\nThe wheelbase length is topped only by select models of Rolls, Bentley and BMW.\n\nThere are three series designations for the Town Car – the Executive, Signature, and top-of-the-line Cartier. The trim levels are the main differences, although Lincoln’s single overhead cam 4.6-liter V-8 has two different power applications for individual models.\n\nThe standard engine produces 190-horsepower, while the 4.6 that is in the Cartier model puts out 210-horsepower via a dual exhaust system.\n\nExterior model designations for the Executive and Signature sedans have been relocated from the rear-quarter windows to the front fenders. They include new, distinctive graphics for a more prominent appearance.\n\nThe high-line Cartier nomenclature is retained on the rear quarter window.\n\nAs a full-size six-seater, the Town Car’s size obviously gives license to a comfortable mode of transportation. Driver and passengers are isolated from the outside world, and served by electronic genies.\n\nActually there’s not a whole lot more to do than steer. I f you have a need, there is a button or switch for it. A full range of power accessories operate an equally full range of controls and information readouts.\n\nThere is, of course, no manual transmission. Silken smooth shifts come from an electronically controlled four-speed automatic. And while hammer down acceleration with two tons of automobile is not going to set any drag-racing records, the car gets up and goes.\n\nAs a luxury sedan, the ’97 Town Car has some luxury prices that range from $37,280 for the Executive model to $43,200 for the Cartier. Add to that $670 for freight, and you’re driving the last of the big ones.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln’s rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan earned a substantial reworking for the 2003 model year. Flaunting a new stand-up hood ornament, the four-door Town Car’s appearance grew noticeably more formal. Changes for 2007 are minimal.\n\nLincoln offers Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels. The Signature L sedan is 6 inches longer than its mates, both overall and in wheelbase length. Three additional series are available for limousine and livery use.\n\nThree new body colors are available for 2007. The Town Car’s new wheel selection includes machined-aluminum units with 9, 10 or 12 spokes, as well as an 18-spoke chromed-aluminum wheel. New front crash-severity sensors were installed for 2005, and the front passenger seat got occupant-weight and seat-track-position sensors.\n\nExterior\nThe Town Car’s formal appearance leads off with a chrome vertical-bar grille that’s flanked by quad-beam halogen headlights. A stand-up ornament is mounted at the front of the hood. High-intensity-discharge headlights are optional on uplevel models. Large taillamps bring up the rear.\n\nStandard models are 215.4 inches long overall on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, while the extended-length L sedans measure 221.4 inches long overall with a 123.7-inch wheelbase. All models have 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels. Whitewall tires, two-tone paint and a powered glass moonroof are optional. New colors offered for 2007 are Dark Blue Metallic, Silver Metallic and White Chocolate Clearcoat.\n\nInterior\nProgrammable adjustable pedals, keyless entry and dual-zone automatic climate control are standard for 2007. Higher trim levels get a power open and close trunk.\n\nAlso standard are eight-way power seats for the driver and outboard front passenger, power lumbar support and extended rear parking assist. Heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inserts are standard in the Signature Limited model.\n\nEquipped with a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, the Town Car seats up to six occupants. The seats are trimmed in premium leather. Panels with burl walnut applique decorate the instrument panel and doors, and an elegant analog clock is installed.\n\nDesigner sedans feature Provence leather seating surfaces and adjustable rear head restraints. The extended-length Signature L has heated rear seats, a folding rear armrest, remote audio and climate controls, and rear-located controls for the outboard front passenger seat. Lincoln’s optional navigation system incorporates THX-Certified audio and a six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Town Car’s 4.6-liter V-8 develops 239 horsepower and 287 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission available. All-speed traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Town Car yields a surprisingly appealing driving experience, offering a secure, confident sensation and good connection with the road.\n\nTown Cars are exceptionally stable on the expressway and especially easy to drive; they deliver a smooth yet controlled ride. The sedan is very quiet, but you can hear the engine. Braking is less pleasing because the pedal may exhibit a long dead spot before the brakes become effective.\n\nInterior space is abundant, and rear legroom in the extended-length L sedan is massive. The seat bottoms are fairly long and well cushioned, but support could be better.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln’s rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan earned a substantial reworking for the 2003 model year. Flaunting a new stand-up hood ornament, the four-door Town Car’s appearance grew noticeably more formal.\n\nFor 2006, Lincoln offers Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels. The Signature L sedan is 6 inches longer than its mates, both overall and in wheelbase length. Three additional series are available for limousine and livery use.\n\nTwo new body colors and a pair of new two-tone paint schemes are available for 2006. The Town Car’s new wheel selection includes machined-aluminum units with 10 or 12 spokes, as well as an 18-spoke chromed-aluminum wheel. New front crash-severity sensors were installed for 2005, and the front passenger seat got occupant-weight and seat-track-position sensors.\n\nExterior\nThe Town Car’s formal appearance leads off with a chrome vertical-bar grille that’s flanked by quad-beam halogen headlights. A stand-up ornament is mounted at the front of the hood. High-intensity-discharge headlights are optional on uplevel models. Large taillamps bring up the rear.\n\nStandard models are 215.4 inches long overall on a 117.7-inch wheelbase, while the extended-length L sedans measure 221.4 inches long overall with a 123.7-inch wheelbase. All models have 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels. Whitewall tires, two-tone paint and a powered glass moonroof are optional.\n\nInterior\nEquipped with a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, the Town Car seats up to six occupants. The seats are trimmed in premium leather. Panels with burl walnut appliqu� decorate the instrument panel and doors, and an elegant analog clock is installed.\n\nStandard equipment includes eight-way power seats for the driver and outboard front passenger, power lumbar support, dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable pedals and extended rear parking assist. Heated front seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inserts are standard in the Signature Limited model.\n\nDesigner sedans feature Provence leather seating surfaces and adjustable rear head restraints. The extended-length Signature L has heated rear seats, a folding rear armrest, remote audio and climate controls, and rear-located controls for the outboard front passenger seat. Lincoln’s optional navigation system incorporates THX-Certified audio and a six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Town Car’s 4.6-liter V-8 develops 239 horsepower and 287 pounds-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission available. All-speed traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCurrent models deliver a more secure, confident sensation than pre-2003 Town Cars by offering a greater connection with the road. This sedan yields a surprisingly appealing driving experience.\n\nTown Cars are exceptionally stable on the expressway and especially easy to drive; they deliver a smooth yet controlled ride. The sedan is very quiet, but you can hear the engine. Braking is less pleasing because the pedal may exhibit a long dead spot before the brakes become effective.\n\nInterior space is abundant, and rear legroom in the extended-length L sedan is massive. The seat bottoms are fairly long and well cushioned, but support could be better.",

      "expert_review": "Squint your eyes when you look at Lincoln’s Town Car and you can see hints of a classic Jaguar sedan in its mouth-shaped grille, sharply rounded roofline and curved taillights.\n\nThe Town Car is classically American, too, and much bigger than any Jag would ever be. It uses a full-perimeter frame, separate body, single-overhead-cam (SOHC) V8 engine and rear-wheel drive.\n\nLast year it underwent a complete redesign and was cloaked with a body that is a vast departure from the upright and angular look of its predecessor. Some traditionalists may miss the old car, with its pillow-soft ride, gargantuan trunk and a nose that bobbed over bumps like the bow of a ship at sea, but most folks will find the new car’s youthful look and tighter handling more appealing.\n\nThe redesigned Town Car is one prong of a three-product strategy aimed at attracting younger buyers. The Navigator SUV and the mid-size Lincoln sports sedan, due for debut later this year, are the other two.\n\nSince the entire car was reworked last year, upgrades to the Town Car for 1999 have been incremental, with one exception: Side airbags are now mounted in the front seats.\n\nOn the Executive series, door panels get wood trim and the front armrest contains a storage bin. Rear armrests have cupholders. Power seat controls are now on the door instead of the seat, and a two-tone paint scheme is offered.\n\nOur test car was a refrigerator-white Cartier model, with bone colored leather seats and woodgrain trim on the dash. The woodgrain trim adds liveliness and warmth to the broad, flat expanse of the instrument panel, which has very little sculpting in order to preserve the three-across capability of the front bench seat. The instrumentation was a jarring combination of white-on-black gauges and bright-green digital readouts for fuel and odometer. The electro-luminescent, round-gauge panel from the Continental would seem more appropriate for a car in this price category.\n\nThe radio is located high in the center of the dash, a long reach for me, but auxiliary controls on the steering wheel made change stations or volume a simple move of my finger on the wheel.\n\nSix can sit inside the Town Car, although most folks won’t squeeze themselves quite that tight very often. The seats, both front and back, are broad and accommodating.\n\nThe trunk has 20.1 cubic feet, but taking full advantage of it is tricky because the spare tire partially blocks access. With careful packing it will hold a reasonable amount of luggage, just don’t plan on carrying a large box back there.\n\nMirroring the change to a more youthful exterior, the Town Car’s driving dynamics have undergone a similar transformation. The ride is still plush, but it feels more controlled, and less floaty, now. Lincoln says the Watt’s Linkage rear suspension improves straight-line tracking and counters the tendency for the vehicle to squat under acceleration and dive under braking.\n\nSteer ing improvements are noticeable, but it still feels over-boosted at slow speeds.\n\nMechanically, the Town Car is almost identical to the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis. The 4.6-liter, V8 engine puts out 205 horsepower in standard form, but a dual exhaust system on the Cartier and Signature Touring Sedan models bring that to 220. This engine has adequate power and performs smoothly, even though it has to haul around about 4,000 pounds.\n\nOf course, the transmission is automatic, and the lever is mounted on the steering column. Shifting out of overdrive for more power is done by punching a button on the end of the lever.\n\nLast year’s redesign of the Town Car was dramatic. This year’s addition of side airbags fixes one of the shortcomings and should improve its safety.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the Cartier model I drove was $42,825. The premium package (power moonroof and trunk-mounted compact disc player) brought the sticker price to $45,090.\n\nWa anty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: While the Town Car has not drunk fully from the Fountain of Youth, it now acts much younger than it used to. The ride is firmer, the styling more contemporary and the engine is smooth.\n\nCounterpoint: Some folks won’t like the new styling or the firmer ride. The steering could use continued improvement for better feel, and the large trunk is hard to load efficiently.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 4.6-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 117.7 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,015 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $43,825\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $45,090\n\nMPG RATING: 17 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Call it Ivory soap because the Town Car floats.\n\nThis is one of the last of the big boats, a massive six-passenger luxurycar whose suspension system is designed to cushion all occupants from theslightest imperfection in the roadway.\n\nAs a result, however, when entering the interstate, you swing wide and leansharply and feel as if you are riding on the sidewalls.\n\nThis is not a car to be driven aggressively, unless your definition ofaggressive is 75 m.p.h. in a straight line between Chicago and Detroit onInterstate Highway 94.\n\nThe Town Car is meant for lap-of-luxury motoring, the traditional soft,cushy approach to travel. You’ll arrive as fresh as when you left. Just beprepared for a rather sterile, uneventful trip.\n\nYou want to leave I-94 and take some twisting, bending roads with a seriesof hills for a taste of adventure? You’ll wish you had taken a CadillacDeVille.\n\nThis is a car of choice for the folks who have labored long and hard intheir careers and now want to be pampered.\n\nThe Town Car is powered by a 4.6-liter, 210-h.p. V-8 that’s sufficientlypowerful and quiet. No traveling at the back of the pack.\n\nSome noteworthy features include fuel-filler door and deck-lid releasebuttons (with deck-lid lock) in the driver’s door alongside the heated seatcontrol. The fuel gauge has an arrow pointing to the side of the fuel-fillerdoor, and the trunk will handle a week’s supply of luggage or several sets ofgolf clubs.\n\nOne major gripe: If you lower the windows and open the sunroof, be preparedto dial the radio volume as high as it goes.\n\nWe tested the 1996 Signature Series Town Car, which starts at $39,350. Inaddition to those items noted, standard equipment includes dual air bags,16-inch all-season tires, color-keyed bumpers and bodyside moldings, dualpower mirrors, dual fold up/down center armrests with pre-wiring for acellular phone, digital clock, dual cupholders, AM/FM stereo with cassette,power seats with memory settings, automatic temperature control, power brakeswith four-wheel ABS, power steering, rear-window defroster, delayed accessorypower so you can power up/down the windows after the ignition is off, tintedglass, remote keyless entry, power door locks, speed control, tilt steeringand power windows.\n\nOur test car added a $2,925 touring suspension package that includestraction assist, power moonroof, JBL sound system and automatic dimmingrearview mirror. Other options included heated seats at $290, a full-sizespare tire at $220, leather seats at $570 and a trunk-mounted compact discchanger at $815. With a $640 freight charge and a $1,100 discount on thetouring package, the Town Car stickered at $43,710.",

      "expert_review": "Full-metal dinner jacket\nIn today’s scary world, does the armor-clad Lincoln Town Car BPS qualify as a family car?\n\nThe National Rifle Assn. is right when it says guns don’t kill people. Bullets kill people, and really big bullets traveling at four times the speed of sound kill people with excellent and resounding authority. Welcome to the fascinating world of rifle-grade ballistics. Please keep your brains inside your skull during the ride.\n\nThe new Lincoln Town Car BPS (Ballistic Protection Series) is the only rifle-grade armored car made by a North American manufacturer, certified to meet or exceed the National Institute of Justice’s Level III ballistic testing, a standard that easily rebuffs ordnance fired by common gats such as a Beretta 9-millimeter handgun. The $145,000 vehicle — which for reasons of discretion looks exactly like a regular Town Car, otherwise known in Los Angeles as a “studio car” — can withstand rifle rounds that would fell an elephant, including the .308-caliber round Bwana might fire while hunting with his Winchester.\n\nThe full-metal-jacket version of this round is known to NATO forces as 7.62-millimeter-by-51-millimeter “ball” ammunition. Science geek alert: The 7.62 round has a muzzle velocity of 2,750 feet per second and imparts to the 150-grain projectile a kinetic energy of about 2,511 foot-pounds. In the face of these enormous kinetic values, even the most Olympian of hardbodies is nothing more than a bowl of Jell-O.\n\nIn addition to these big-bore threats, the Town Car BPS will ward off the NATO 5.56-millimeter-by-45-millimeter “armor-piercing” round — high-velocity assault-rifle ammo with a tungsten core that can, whistling through the air at 3,000 feet per second, punch through quarter-inch armor plating. Also, the Ballistic Town Car has an aramid-weave ballistic blast blanket in the floor to protect against small antipersonnel mines and grenades.\n\nAll of which means, for instance, that the Town Car BPS would afford our troops in Iraq superior protection over many of the ad-hoc, half-baked “up-armored” Humvees they are currently obliged to patrol in. The thought of American troops rolling into battle in black limos is funny. Why am I not laughing?\n\nFear factor\n\nThe market for private armored cars picked up after 9/11 but, says Ford executive Rick Bondy, the former G-man in charge of the BPS program, it may have less to do with increased threat than increased perception of risk.\n\n“People might perceive risk more now because of what they know and what they hear and the timeliness that they hear it in,” says the no-nonsense Bondy, who has ballistic-shaped gray hair and armor-piercing eyes. “But is there more violence? I can’t tell you and nobody else can either.\n\n“If someone perceives that they are at risk and they want to feel safer and more serene going through life, then they buy one of these products.”\n\nTher e are scores of armorers around the world that retrofit production cars with ballistic protection. The armored-car business is very big in the Middle East, Central and South America and Asia. Some of the big aftermarket companies, such as Ohio-based O’Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt, offer assault-rifle ballistic retrofitting, but Bondy argues convincingly that the automakers themselves are in the best position to engineer a ballistic car.\n\n“There are over 700 unique parts in our ballistic cars and every one of them is a Ford part with a Ford part number,” he says. “Everything has been tested — crash testing, durability testing, rough-road testing. I know the doors will close 80,000 times. I know that the windshield won’t become a secondary projectile in a crash. I know the air bags work. We’re going to build these products to the same standard and with the same serviceability as any other product we sell.”\n\nLincoln will sell the BPS cars through 16 authorized dealers, includ ng the Galpin Ford mega-dealership in the San Fernando Valley, but the cars can be serviced at any Lincoln dealership.\n\nLast year, Cadillac announced that it was partnering with Scaletta Moloney Armoring to build a ballistic series DeVille. Scaletta armors a variety of big SUVs for the Government Services Administration; the company already builds a number of Sedan DeVille motorcade vehicles for the GSA, including — and this is a secret — the presidential limousine, which looks like the unholy spawn of a DeVille and an Abrams tank.\n\nThe Cadillac is a handgun-rated car, capable of withstanding a .44-magnum round. This is roughly the same level of protection offered by the Mercedes-Benz S500 Guard, meeting the European B4 ballistic standard. Both Mercedes-Benz and BMW sell cars capable of taking a hit from a 7.62 armor-piercing round (B6/B7-level protection). However, neither company imports the B6/B7-grade cars into the United States.\n\nThe rifle-grade Town Car BPS is aimed directly at the handgun-grade Mercedes S500 Guard, with a price point slightly below the German car.\n\n“We said if we’re going to get in this business we were going to do it at a higher level than anybody that has been in the business before. We’re the new kids on the block so we’re built at a higher level, from a ballistic standpoint, than Mercedes or BMW.”\n\nAll the windows in the Lincoln are 40-millimeter-thick ballistic transparent armor, comprising layers of glass and polycarbonate. Ballistic steel (Brinell hardness rating over 600) wraps the roof, engine compartment, door seals and firewall. In the doors themselves, ballistic ceramics, backed with steel and aramid blankets, protect the passenger compartment. The fuel tank is surrounded with a self-sealing compound to reduce leakage.\n\nEscape velocity\n\nTough enough for you? Yet given enough time, says Bondy, any “ballistic solution” will fail. “People can keep putting bullets in the same hole.”\n\nIn the moment of extremity, the driver of a car under attack may become unnerved, panic, or — in my case, I’m sure — lose control of bodily functions in a spectacular way. Bondy and his team tried to give the Town Car BPS as benign a handling profile as possible.\n\n“Vehicle dynamics has to be equally important as the ballistic solution,” says Bondy. “If you crash while someone’s trying to kill you, you’re going to die.”\n\nThe Town Car BPS is built on the heavy-duty frame of the company’s stretch limo. The shocks, springs, control arms, bushings and sway bars are upgraded to cope with the car’s 6,220-pound curb weight. Underneath is a heavy-duty axle with a 3.55:1 rear gear, giving the car better off-the-mark acceleration. The tires are 17-inch all-season Michelins with run-flat inserts.\n\nNights in shining armor\n\nQuiet. The first sensation of the Town Car BPS is a dramatic, deafening silence in the cabin. The 40-millimeter glass kee ps out sound as well as bullets.\n\nWeight. A surfeit of freakish, grand-piano heft exudes from this car. If you park the car on any kind of sideways incline, those on the uphill side will struggle to open the doors, which must weigh 300 pounds apiece. Eventually you adapt a technique of squeezing out of the door like toothpaste. The door hinges do not have the usual detents that prop the doors open. They just swing like the doors of a pawn-shop safe.\n\nForget going through the drive-thru. The 40-millimeter (about 1 1/2 inches) windows drop open only about 6 inches, not nearly enough to get a Dairy Queen Blizzard through. On the upside, when seen through polarized sunglasses, the super-thick glass swirls with rainbow moire patterns. Very psychedelic.\n\nInertia. The primary difference between the Mercedes and BMW armored cars and the Town Car BPS is that the German cars have modified engines that cope with the added weight of the armoring. The Lincoln engine is t e stock 4.6-liter, 239-horsepower V8 producing 287 pound-feet of torque at 4,100 rpm. It isn’t enough. The BPS busts a prodigious gut to reach 60 mph in under 12 seconds, and the hills of Hollywood can leave it winded and straining. I was glad no one was chasing me.\n\nUndersteer: What Bondy calls safe, predictable handling is the mother of all understeer. The car simply will not respond beyond a certain speed and steering angle. It handles like a 3-ton hammer on a string.\n\nInvincibility: So it’s no sports car. But it feels like Navarone on four wheels. Once the door closes, you experience a sudden, transforming otherness — the world cannot touch you. Road rage? Please. Take your best shot.\n\nOr not. Here’s a fun fact to keep you up at night: It is perfectly legal — and so easy any deranged lunatic can do it — to buy a Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifle, one of the 5-foot monsters used by American forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and a lot of places you would rather not know about (the California Legislature is now considering AB50, which would ban the sale of .50-caliber rifles in the state). It’s even easier to purchase armor-piercing ammunition for the gun. Put them together and you have one of the world’s most devastating standoff weapons, capable of ventilating a head of state at a mile’s distance, or even taking out one very large Lincoln.\n\nEverybody needs a hobby.\n\n2004 Lincoln Town Car BPS\n\nPrice, as tested: $145,000\n\nPowertrain: 4.6-liter, SOHC V8, four-speed automatic, 3.55:1 rear gear ratio, heavy-duty axle, rear-wheel drive\n\nHorsepower: 239 at 4,900 rpm\n\nTorque: 287 pound-feet at 4,100 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 6,220 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 12 seconds (est.)\n\nWheelbase: 117.7 inches\n\nOverall length: 215.4 inches\n\nCompetitors: Cadillac DeVille armored car, Mercedes-Benz S500 Guard\n\nFinal thoughts: Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they are not out to get you.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis traditional rear-drive luxury sedan embodies the image most consumers have of Lincoln, an image the company is trying to change with models like the LS sedan and Navigator sport utility vehicle.\n\nHowever, the Town Car remains Lincolns best-selling model by far, so dont look for it to disappear soon. Its main audiences are older buyers and limousine companies, and it is due for a face-lift for 2002. Lincoln says it will build the Town Car as long as there is sufficient demand.\n\nNew options for the Town Car this year center on nontraditional hardware and software. Lincoln offers a hands-free, voice-activated cellular phone that later in the year will allow links to 24-hour emergency service and the Internet for e-mail, stock quotes, news and weather.\n\nAll 2001 Lincolns also get free scheduled maintenance for the first three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nExterior\nLincoln added a stretched version of the Town Car last spring, tacking on 6 inches to the wheelbase and overall length. The standard-size model rides a 118-inch wheelbase and is 215 inches overall  8 inches longer than the front-drive Cadillac DeVille, its archrival.\n\nThe Town Car is built on the same platform used for the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis but is longer and has different styling.\n\nInterior\nWith its long wheelbase and wide interior, the Town Car provides ample room for occupants to lounge  at least the ones in the outboard seats. The middle seats straddle the driveshaft tunnel and have less legroom and comfort than other positions. The split, front bench seat and wide rear bench coddle the outboard passengers by comparison.\n\nWide, tall doors make it easy to get in and out, and all models come with standard leather upholstery and lavish amounts of comfort and convenience features. Power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals with a 3-inch range are now standard.\n\nThe trunk holds 20.6 cubic feet of luggage, though most of that comes from a deep center well that makes it awkward to load and unload because the spare tire hangs over the forward end.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.6-liter V-8 engine and four-speed automatic transmission are standard on all models. On the Executive and Signature models, horsepower increases by 20 this year to 220. Dual exhausts are standard on the top-shelf Cartier model and included with the Touring Package available for the Signature, and horsepower increases by 20 to 235. Standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Town Car lost a little size and weight when it was redesigned for 1998 and gained some athletic ability. It is still a large, cushy, traditional American luxury car, but it is far more agile and manageable than previous versions. The Cadillac DeVille feels more refined and powerful, so those who are interested should compare before they decide.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "There’s a certain timelessness to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nUnlike small, hard-riding cars, the Town Car is large and cushy. While other cars have dashboards cluttered with buttons, the Lincoln is a model of simplicity.\n\nThis appeals to Town Car loyalists: almost 60 percent are repeat buyers; 65 percent don’t even consider another vehicle.\n\nBut the average buyer is 70 years old.\n\nLincoln is trying to entice new buyers by changing the feel of the Town Car without annoying longtime buyers. So, for 2003, the Town Car got a makeover.\n\nThe vehicle is available in Cartier, Signature, and Executive trim levels and a new long wheelbase Cartier L is available for the first time.\n\nThe longest production car in America, the Lincoln Town Car Cartier L, is a very easy car to drive and handle.\n\nWith a new steering rack, larger 17-inch tires, new frame, new front suspension and revised rear suspension, the Town Car no longer bounds, dips and shimmies like a drunken sailor when the road turns challenging. While not truly agile, the vehicle has new speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering that helps give the car a more refined feel, although steering effort is still light.\n\nThe improved driving dynamics are a surprise and a delight, especially since the Town Car still delivers its trademark smooth, quiet ride.\n\nWhile the handling finesse is welcome, braking could be a lot better. Four wheel anti-lock disc brakes are standard, as is electronic brakeforce distribution, which helps to ensure sufficient braking control.\n\nUnder the hood, the Town Car is still lacking. The single-overhead-cam, 16-valve 4.6-liter V-8 generates just 239 horsepower.\n\nTo put that into perspective, consider that a much lighter car, the Honda Accord, for example, carries 240 horsepower from its V-6.\n\nThe Town Car V-8 has lots of power accelerating from a standstill, but load it with six people and their luggage and there’s just not enough engine to move this car quickly.\n\nThe smooth transmission hesitates before downshifting for more power. Fuel economy is quite good for a 4,300 plus pounds automobile, with mixed use returning a truly surprising 17.5 mpg.\n\nWhile the Town Car is fuel-efficient, don’t challenge any Cadillac DeVille to a drag race. Its 300-horsepower Northstar V-8 has enough power to whip the Town Car every time.\n\nStill there’s one point on which Cadillac cannot compete: space.\n\nKudos should go to Ford for bringing back a luxury car tradition that has never gone out of style in Europe: the long-wheelbase luxury car. Cadillac used to offer such a vehicle, but it’s been almost a decade since it was discontinued.\n\nThe long-wheelbase Town Car Cartier L adds six inches to the standard Town Car. This allows for limousine-like back s eat space, which is perfect for making out. (I will not comment on how this was tested.)\n\nThe trunk is huge, at a body-swallowing 21 cubic feet. The Cartier L came with a covered bin that could stow smaller items, a nice touch.\n\nUp front, a beautifully redesigned dashboard has a sophisticated look, although the materials could be of better quality considering the car’s $51,000 base price.\n\nThe Town Car abounds with the luxuries that are now common in this class, including rear parking assist, leather interior, wood trim and thick carpet, an Alpine AM/FM/cassette/CD audio system with trunk-mounted 6-CD changer, rear seat ventilation controls, heated front seats, rain-sensing wipers, power trunk lid, universal garage door opener, a digital compass, electronic message center, dual climate control, steering wheel-mounted speed control, climate and audio controls.\n\nRear seat amenities standard on the Cartier L include redundant audio and climate controls mounted in the armrest, two additional powerpoints, an ashtray and cigar lighter in each door and a redundant control to adjust the fore and aft position of the front passenger seat, as well as heated rear seats.\n\nWhile the rain-sensing wipers are a nice idea, they didn’t always seem to sense rain.\n\nThe power opening/closing trunk is a terrific option, but when closing, it would pop back open for no apparent reason. Worse was the poor fit of the trunk lid.\n\nThe rear parking assist is appreciated in a car that measures more than 221 inches long, but it was extremely sensitive, with an alarm going off even when the car was at adequate distant from a wall or post.\n\nAll Town Cars receive fresh styling this year, although only Lincoln dealers and Town Car loyalists will notice the difference.\n\nThere’s a new grille, hood, fenders and quarter panels, high-intensity discharge headlamps and a stand-up hood ornament.\n\nOut back is a redesigned trunk lid, tail lamps and other modifications that give the car a more formal, dignified look.\n\nBut the similarity to the previous car and the still-underwhelming engine won’t entice new buyers to the Town Car fold.\n\nJames G. O’Connor, Group Vice President, North America Marketing, Sales and Service, said at the 2003 New York Auto Show, “We really missed a chance to do more with the Town Car, I’ll admit that.”\n\nLincoln has succeeded in making the Town Car more rewarding to drive while still delivering a smooth, quiet ride.\n\nBut it will take more than that to appeal to new customers.\n\nLINCOLN TOWN CAR CARTIER L\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter SOHC V8\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nTires: P225/60R17\n\nWheelbase: 123.7 inches\n\nLength: 221.4 inches\n\nWidth: 63.4 inches\n\nWeight: 4,467 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 21.1 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $51,000\n\nAs tested: $51,920\n\nEPA rating: 17 city, 25 highway\n\nTest mileage: 17.5 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: Wixom, Mich.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincolns rear-drive luxury sedan, the traditional favorite of older buyers and limousine companies, will probably earn some appearance changes for 2003. These revisions may include a raised hood to accommodate an optional 300-horsepower V-8 engine, a reworked front end with a smaller grille, a revised suspension, 17-inch tires and a bigger trunk  an improvement that limousine drivers should fully appreciate. The Town Car was last redesigned for the 1998 model year.\n\nThe Town Car is basically the last vehicle of its kind on the market. For 2002, it gets a new Vehicle Communication System (VCS) as an option. The system includes a transportable digital/analog Motorola Timeport phone with voice activation and hands-free capability. VCS offers automatic emergency service notification upon airbag deployment, route assistant, and news and information services. The 4.6-liter V-8 develops either 220 hp or 235 hp, depending on the model. Both standard-length and extended-wheelbase versions are available.\n\nThis big sedan best conveys the image that most consumers still have of Lincoln. But to keep up with the times, the company has been trying to alter that image by introducing such vehicles as the LS sedan and the Navigator sport utility vehicle. Another SUV, called the Aviator, will be joining the Lincoln lineup later.\n\nExterior\nIn standard form, the Town Car rides a 117.7-inch wheelbase and measures 215.3 inches long overall  about 8 inches longer than its long-time archrival, the front-drive Cadillac DeVille. Though it is built on the same basic rear-drive platform as the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, the Town Car is larger and displays entirely different styling, led by a waterfall vertical-bar grille.\n\nThe Cartier L extended model is far heavier than the standard trims, and it is exactly 6 inches longer than the base Executive model in both wheelbase and overall size. All Town Car models are 78.2 inches wide and about 58 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nEven in standard form, six occupants have space to stretch out in the Town Cars wide interior. But passengers in both center positions must straddle the driveshaft tunnel and can be considerably less comfortable. Both the driver and front passenger have eight-way power-adjustable seating with power lumbar adjustment of the split bench. A memory feature controls the front seats, mirrors, and power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedal settings.\n\nTall, wide doors make it easy to get in and out of the Town Car. An optional easy entry/exit drivers seat feature moves the seat rearward when necessary to ease access. The seats are trimmed in leather. In both models, the trunk holds an ample 20.6 cubic feet of cargo. Because the spare tire hangs over the forward end, much of that space consists of a deep center well that makes it difficult to load and unload the trunk.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.6-liter V-8 engine and four-speed-automatic transmission go into all Town Cars. The V-8 for the Executive and Signature editions produces 220 hp. Dual exhausts are added to the Cartier models and the Signature Touring Sedan (STS), and output climbs to 235 hp. All-disc antilock brakes, all-speed traction control and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Lincoln Town Car sees plenty of service in livery fleets that hover around airports and convention centers, because its the only large rear-drive luxury sedan that remains on the market with a fairly reasonable price. A little smaller in size than the previous-generation Town Car of the 1990s, its also more agile. But its still not ready to take on tight, fast curves without a protest. As it has always been, the Town Car is basically this: a cushy, quiet, traditional American luxury sedan with a suitable ride for its passengers and power thats more than adequate but not startling.\n\nCadillacs front-drive DeVille feels more refined, and its Northstar V-8 engine is more powerful, but plenty of affluent consumers would rather ride in this familiar Lincoln.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
