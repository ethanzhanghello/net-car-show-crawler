      "expert_review": "The all-new MKS marks a resurgence of the Lincoln brand as the company remakes itself into one that can compete with brands such as Acura, Lexus and Cadillac.\n\nThe MKS has a sleek profile punctuated by a large, double-wing grille that is becoming Lincoln’s signature. Lincoln said the new grille can be traced to the 1941 Lincoln Continental.\n\nCharacter lines sweep over the hood and into the A-pillars. The windshield is reclined rather steeply. Stainless steel accents run over the roof to the trunk. It’s not hard to see the influence of competing cars, particularly the Lexus GS, in the styling of the MKS.\n\nThe chassis platform used for the MKS was derived from the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable and also has roots in the Volvo S80.\n\nThe MKS is available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Base prices begin at $37,665 for front-wheel drive and $39,555 for all-wheel drive. The test car’s sticker price was $44,975.\n\nLincoln engineers benchmarked the Lexus GS chassis for ride and handling. The MKS feels solid and secure. It doesn’t seem to be as quiet as the Lexus.\n\nThe cabin is a cozy place. Comfort, convenience and style are key attributes. The interior exhibits a refined elegance, revised gauges and a center stack that looks more elegant than that of any other Lincoln. Brushed silver accents highlight the center console that has multiple storage spaces.\n\nThe test car’s black leather upholstery worked extremely well with the silver and chrome accents used throughout the instrument panel. The gauges are not as slick as the electroluminescent ones used in some competitors.\n\nThe seats in the MKS are more upright than some of its competitors’, and that makes it easy to get in and out. The front doors are wide.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable, although I found the forward-leaning headrest was in my way unless I raised it all the way up. Headrests are close to the occupant to provide whiplash protection.\n\nThe keyless ignition works as long as the key fob is in the driver’s purse or pocket. The security code keypad on the driver’s door pillar is also handy for times when you don’t want to use a key.\n\nThe navigation system has a six-month subscription to Sirius satellite radio Travel Link. Travel Link provides up-to-the-minute traffic and weather information for 78 markets as well as gasoline prices at 120,000 filling stations.\n\nThe adaptive cruise control is another convenience option. This system uses radar to maintain a set distance behind the car in front, even in rain or snow.\n\nThe MKS uses a 3.7-liter derivative of Ford’s 3.5-liter V-6. The added displacement and variable valve timing improve torque, and that enhances the car’s throttle response for passing and climbing hills.\n\nFuel economy is a hot issue, and Ford has equipped the MKS with a program that shuts off the fuel pump when the car is decelerating, improving mileage slightly. The Environmental Protection Agency rates fuel economy at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway for all-wheel drive. Cars with front-wheel drive are rated 1 mpg better.\n\nThe transmission is a six-speed automatic that can be shifted manually. The optional all-wheel-drive system is great for inclement weather in the Snow Belt and was handy on last week’s slippery roads.\n\nNext year, Lincoln will introduce a twin-turbo, direct-injection V-6 that will have 340 horsepower and 340 pound-feet of torque. This engine, called EcoBoost, has the power of a V-8 and the 23-mpg highway fuel economy of a V-6.\n\nSafety features include seat-mounted side airbags, a collapsible steering column and safety-belt pretensioners.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of an all-wheel-drive MKS is $39,555. With rain-sensing wipers, adaptive headlights, navigation system, adaptive cruise control and 19-inch wheels, the sticker price was $44,975.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles, with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Lincoln MKS\n\nEngine: 3.7-liter, 273-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 112.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,276 lbs.\n\nBase price: $39,555\n\nAs driven: $44,975\n\nMPG rating: 16 city, 23 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Lincoln MKS luxury sedan competes with the Acura RL, Infiniti M and Cadillac STS. Lincoln has at least one advantage going in: The MKS is based on the Ford Taurus, a car whose full-size dimensions mean more interior room than most of the midsize offerings in the luxury-sedan segment. The MKS comes with a choice of V-6 engines and front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe optional navigation system adds HD radio, and the standard Sync system now integrates directions and traffic information with the voice-controlled nav system.\n\nExterior\nIt’s difficult to tell the MKS is related to the Taurus, as Lincoln has done much to differentiate its version. Styling elements include Lincoln’s familiar waterfall grille, cut by a vertical strip with Lincoln’s crossbar logo. The thin, horizontal headlights look a lot like the ones on an Acura TL.\n\nAround back, the taillights flow toward a high bumper. There are chrome elements on the window frames, doorsills and outlines on the lower air dam. The MKS with the optional EcoBoost engine features a unique grille, side rocker panels and a rear spoiler. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 18-, 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nKeyless-entry keypad\nCapless refueling system\nFog lamps\nAutomatic high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nDual chrome exhaust\nOptional dual-panel sunroof\nOptional adaptive headlights\n\nInterior\nInside, the MKS’ interior comes with lots of leather; it covers the seats, door panels and dashboard. The center controls flow seamlessly toward a center tunnel that supports the gearshift and two independently adjustable armrests. Interior features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces, shifter and steering wheel\nPowered tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nFord Sync system\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated/cooled front seats\nOptional voice-activated navigation\nOptional THX 14-speaker surround-sound stereo\nOptional adaptive cruise control and self-parking system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe MKS’ base 3.7-liter V-6 is a unique engine, not found on the Ford Taurus. It works with a six-speed automatic transmission and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. For 2010, the MKS added the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine with direct injection. At 355 horsepower, the EcoBoost has the power output of a 4.6-liter V-8, but with V-6 fuel economy (17/25 mpg city/highway). The EcoBoost V-6 comes standard with all-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n273-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 with 270 pounds-feet of torque\n355-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 with 350 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nAvailable front- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nFord’s Sync system also features a 911-assist feature that connects the vehicle’s occupants to an emergency operator when an airbag deploys. Safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags\nTraction control\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nReverse-sensing system\nOptional rearview camera",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2008 about the 2009 Lincoln MKS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLincoln is a brand adrift in the automotive marketplace. Few of its models set themselves apart from lesser-equipped Fords, and those that do usually fall short of the competition from Lexus, Infiniti and Cadillac. The all-new MKS is the closest the brand has come to delivering a top-class vehicle, and it gives sedan shoppers a reason to enter a Lincoln showroom.\n\nThere are a number of areas where the MKS excels, including its spacious interior, sleek looks, technology features and overall value. Its biggest drawback is that it doesn’t ride like any big Lincoln sedan we’ve driven recently, which means the word “cushy” will not come into play for the rest of this review. That may turn off loyal buyers, without a significant-enough performance benefit added to draw in enthusiasts.\n\nOverall, though, the positives vastly outweigh the negatives in what is possibly the best Lincoln since the Mark VIII.\n\nPerformance\nThe most striking aspect of the MKS’ performance is its steering. From the looks and the sheer size of the car, I was expecting a driving experience akin to yachting, not carving corners. I was wrong; the driving experience doesn’t rival a Corvette’s, but Lincoln should be proud of how precisely the MKS steers.\n\nWhether you’re in a tight parking garage or taking a highway on-ramp, the steering wheel requires little effort to move the car where you want it to be. The feel of the wheel and how the car reacts are completely intuitive — much better than any car this size or price has a right to be. I would rate it up there with any Cadillac (if not better than larger models like the DTS) and even imports like the Volvo S80, with which the MKS shares its platform.\n\nHowever, you do sacrifice ride comfort for this steering precision. I was shocked at how bumpy the ride was on rough roads. The MKS reminded me of a sport-tuned BMW 5 Series in terms of ride comfort — and that’s not a positive comparison to a BMW 5 Series — instead of a big American sedan. Maybe I’m strange, but I like a cushy ride out of my big American sedans, and I think most buyers of big American sedans feel the same way.\n\nMy test car was an all-wheel-drive version, which can translate to a rougher ride, but I don’t believe that was the reason for my experience. Front-wheel drive is standard on the base MKS, which starts at $37,665, while the all-wheel-drive MKS starts at $39,555. What weren’t standard were the 19-inch wheels my test car had, which again would contribute to a rougher ride. The standard wheels, though, are 18-inchers, and I’d bet the resulting ride wouldn’t be dramatically improved. Other Cars.com reviewers also commented on the rough ride as an MKS negative.\n\nPower is adequate if not overwhelming, coming from Ford’s capable 273-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6. There’s plenty of passing power, with little engine noise intruding into the cabin. It’s not Lexus-silent, but it’s certainly as quiet as most automakers’ big sedans; Lexus’ cars are just eerily quiet. Lincoln will introduce a turbocharged V-6 for the MKS in calendar 2009, which should add an air of performance to the MKS. It already has the steering and rough ride of a performance sedan, so the turbo makes a lot of sense.\n\nFuel economy is decent, at 17/24 mpg city/highway for front-wheel-drive models and 16/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. I achieved sub-20 mpg figures in the real world, but I also drove quite a bit in ultra-congested Chicago. Cadillac’s aging STS V-6 with rear-wheel drive somehow manages 17/26 mpg with more power.\n\nThe MKS also comes with an auto-shift function for the six-speed automatic transmission that allows you to manually select gears without a clutch. Like in most cars with this feature, you move the gear selector up or down to shift gears. The MKS’ shifter responds with loud “thunks” each time. No, that’s not an engine noise; it’s emanating from the shifter. I rarely find this function useful in such cars, and in this one it’s definitely a detractor. As is true in most non-performance cars, the MKS’ standard automatic operation is far superior to using the manual function, and it still isn’t the smoothest transmission in the segment.\n\nLooks\nEven though the MKS is a comfortable car with a refined interior and a lot of standard features, the first thing people will notice is its bold looks. The profile is vanilla bland, but both the snarling front end and the Maserati-influenced rear will turn heads and make people say, “That’s a Lincoln?”\n\nWhile I was testing this car, I had people stop me to ask if I was driving a new Cadillac. Another passerby knew it was a Lincoln and was impressed, again comparing it to Cadillac’s latest CTS in a favorable way.\n\nYou can’t escape the huge grille up front no matter how hard you try; the chrome-covered plastic grille is indeed the new “look” for Lincoln. It’s doubtless the product of an ever-escalating grille war that’s pitting automakers against one another in an attempt to design the largest, most in-your-face bumper-jewelry imaginable.\n\nThe MKS kind of reminds me of the Cheshire Cat from “Alice in Wonderland” — a comparison I’m not the first to mention; I won’t be the last, either. Regardless, it’s distinctive without going too over the top, unlike the new Cadillac CTS and its excessively blinged-out grille.\n\nThe back end hasn’t received nearly as much attention in the press as the front has, but if you put it side by side with Maserati’s Quattroporte sedan, you’ll see where its inspiration lies. Considering the exterior dimensions of the MKS, its two ends work well together to complement the sedan’s sheer size. It comes in at 204.1 inches long, which is longer than a Buick Lucerne and even many three-row crossovers. Basically, this new look will lead to new shoppers, without the whippersnapper in the Lincoln lineup turning off the older set.\n\nInterior\nLincoln has taken a leap forward inside the MKS. My test vehicle was decked out in thick, off-white leather that was wrapped around the seats and doors. It’s of decent quality, about on par with what you find in Volvo and Lexus cars. I found the front seats extremely comfortable, and it was easy enough to find a good seating position. The backseat is also spacious, as you’d expect from something in this class. Heated and air-conditioned front seats are also standard. Unlike other brands with the feature, these A/C seats really do the job.\n\nThe leather- and wood-trimmed dashboard was respectable, but didn’t look or feel as luxurious as the seats. The same could be said of the gauges and center controls, which looked like they were from a lower grade of vehicle — namely a Ford.\n\nWhile they were decent-quality, none of the controls you interact with had the feeling of luxury that a car in this price range should have. This is what separates Lincoln from a Volvo S80, which has similar pricing. While Volvo has gorgeous metal gauges and a unique center swath of controls, the MKS adds a bit of chrome-like film to its plastic buttons, and that’s about it.\n\nLuckily, this downside isn’t a big enough one to completely ruin the MKS. If you can look beyond it to the car’s state-of-the-art control screen and the voice-activated technology hidden behind the scenes, the interior will prove to be a winner.\n\nTechnology and Features\nBesides the looks, impressive steering and comfortable seating, the other thing the MKS has going for it is an intuitive, feature-packed technology center. Unfortunately, the attractive base price of the MKS shoots up $2,995 with the Navigation Package you need to add in order to get most of the high-tech goodies.\n\nMicrosoft’s Sync entertainment system comes standard and controls audio and cell phone applications, but the voice-activated feature controls much more when the navigation system is present. How much more? Well, you get voice-activated navigation and directions, like you’ll find in Acuras and Infinitis, only the MKS’ is a bit more intuitive. You also get local gas prices, movie times, weather and traffic info, all with voice commands.\n\nI’ve tested the standard Sync system many times since it debuted last year and have found it to be one of the simplest, most useful technology features on the market. The simple approach continues when you add these other features to it, and that’s a good thing. Hit a button on the steering wheel and say “weather,” and the screen displays your local forecast. Say “traffic” and — guess what? You get an update on road construction in your area. Say “movie times” and a number of theaters are listed to choose from. The same goes for gas prices. All are useful to most drivers, though movie times are a bit superfluous.\n\nOn top of that, the screen is brilliantly crisp with easy-to-read graphics, and there are plenty of plain-old buttons to manage features not controlled by voice or to use as shortcuts when you’re tired of talking to your car.\n\nAdd the Technology Package ($1,115) and you get add-ons like a rear-window sunshade, keyless entry and ignition, rain-sensing wipers, forward sensors that warn of obstacles when parking, and adaptive headlights.\n\nThe Ultimate Package ($5,715) combines the features in the Technology and Navigation packages, plus adds a dual-panel moonroof (sold separately for $1,695) and 19-inch wheels ($510 as a stand-alone option). I did the math; that saves you $600 compared to adding them a la carte. However, if I could drop one package it would be the Technology Package, with its features that don’t add to the driving experience. Also, no buyer should feel sorry for opting out of the dual-panel moonroof and 19-inch wheels. For my money, the only must is the Navigation Package.\n\nTrunk\nWhy is there a whole separate section for the trunk? Because big American sedans should have big trunks, and at 18.7 cubic feet the MKS’ is quite big. It’s bigger than a Lucerne’s (17.0) or S80’s (14.9). It could easily swallow two sets of golf clubs and copious amounts of luggage.\n\nSafety\nLike most new models, the MKS comes standard with a number of valuable safety features, including front side-impact airbags as well as side curtain airbags for both rows. Stability control, antilock brakes and traction control are also standard.\n\nAs of this writing, the MKS has not been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the federal government.\n\nMKS in the Market\nIn July — the MKS’ first month of sales — it outsold every other Lincoln on the market, including the more affordable MKZ sedan and the MKX crossover. Sales were four times that of the S80. I’m an unabashed fan of the oft-overlooked S80; it is one of the few models on the market that offers similar features, space, level of luxury, performance and price as the MKS.\n\nThat’s partly because this segment isn’t a well-traveled one any longer. Cadillac’s STS and DTS are fading quickly — the MKS also outsold both of those models in July — and haven’t been updated enough to compete with these two newer models. Plus, both the MKS and S80 cost less. Japanese brands like Lexus and Infiniti have tried to emulate German luxury sedans with rear-wheel-drive models in this class, so there is a gap in the market that the MKS fills.\n\nWhere the Lincoln excels and the S80 fails is in the looks department. There is no question that the MKS makes a statement, even if its looks aren’t universally appealing. Personally, I found it to be quite striking during my week of testing, and it should definitely drop the average age of Lincoln sedan shoppers by a few years, if not a generation. The S80, on the other hand, can easily be lost in a crowd; if you don’t notice it at first glance, you’ll never make it behind the wheel to see how good it truly is.\n\nLincoln owes a lot to the S80, but the company should be proud of how distinctive its new sedan truly is.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2013 Lincoln MKS is large and luxurious, and though it looks more like an executive’s car than a mom mobile, I’d happily drive it through the carpool lane anytime.\n\nThe 2013 MKS’ redesign isn’t just cosmetic. The base V-6 engine has more horsepower, and my top-of-the-line test car had a twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 with standard all-wheel drive. It was a fun to drive, though when I stomped on the accelerator, the engine lagged some. The MKS was very much at home on the highway, and I really just wanted to take it on a road trip. While this full-size sedan was big, it didn’t drive that way. I felt confident and comfortable changing lanes, braking and parking.\n\nBut the catch is the cost. The 2013 MKS has a starting price of $43,765, including an $895 destination charge, and my top-line test car started at $50,755. After all the niceties were added, my test car cost $58,265.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe updated 2013 MKS looks fresh and upscale. It has a grille with vertical slats that remind me of a whale’s baleen feeding system and works proportionally with the rest of the car, but it might be polarizing for some shoppers. The rear end is sophisticated looking.\n\nThe MKS feels like a chauffeur’s vehicle, and you may have to act like one because the doors may be a bit much for smaller kids to handle, particularly when closing them from the inside.\n\nBut how does it function in the carpool drop-off lane at my kids’ school? The step-in height is just fine for school-age kids, who can also open and close the doors by themselves.\n\nI test-drove the MKS while on vacation at Disney World in Florida, and one of the first things my husband and I wondered when we saw it was, “Holy cow, will all of our luggage fit in the trunk?” We further questioned the MKS’ trunk because of its tapered opening and odd shape. However, the MKS stunned us because its 18.7-cubic-foot trunk fit out four large suitcases and duffels as well as four carry-ons. Its storage capacity was a delightful surprise.\n\nThe MKS had ample power. A 304-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine is standard and can be paired with front- or all-wheel drive. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/28 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 18/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. My test car had the optional 365-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine and standard all-wheel drive. It gets 17/25 mpg and uses premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some-Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe first thing my son said when getting into the MKS was, “Whoa! Why is it so wide?” At 55.3 inches of rear hiproom in the backseat, the MKS’ bench seat is on par with those in three-row SUVs. The 2013 Ford Explorer has 56.7 inches of rear hiproom, and the 2013 Honda Pilot has 56.9 inches. My kids loved the major expanse of space between them. In the front row, there was so much room my husband and I could sprawl out as much as we wished.\n\nAs the driver, I was thrilled with all the MKS’ amenities. The standard heated and ventilated leather seats were comfortable and moderately bolstered. The optional heated steering wheel got some use even though I was in Florida; it’s cool there in January. I liked the front row’s split armrest. There are two cupholders in the front seats and cubbies in the doors. The glove box is monopolized by the owner’s manual.\n\nAlmost all the buttons on the center stack are touch-activated. Controls that weren’t on the center stack could be accessed on the MyLincoln Touch multimedia system. I’ve used this system many times in Fords and have gotten used to it, but it is by no means a cinch to use. In fact, we used our smartphone’s map app instead of using the MKS’ navigation system because it was easier. The steering wheel has a ton of controls, which looks overwhelming, but they’re easy to use after a while. An LCD screen sits in the instrument cluster, but it’s easy to experience information overload from it and get distracted while driving. I do like that I could customize the information displayed there.\n\nMy kids, aka the backseat passengers, liked the optional power rear sunshade for the optional moonroof and the heated seats. There were two cupholders and a cubby in the fold-down armrest.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Lincoln MKS works well with child-safety seats. There are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats that are clearly marked and easy to use. The bench seat isn’t too bolstered for any kind of car seat. The seat belt buckles are somewhat floppy, which might be tricky for little hands just getting used to buckling up independently.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has named the 2013 MKS a Top Safety Pick, its second-highest award. The MKS also earned a top overall safety score of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe MKS has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, adaptive headlights, an electronic stability system with traction control, front and rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nAdaptive cruise control, a backup camera, lane departure and blind spot warning systems, and drowsy driver detection are optional. Park Assist, which is also optional, helps the driver find a parallel-parking spot where the MKS can fit and helps park the car.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Lincoln MKS.",
