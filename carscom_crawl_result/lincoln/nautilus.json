      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Lincoln Nautilus is the cushy, stylish, tech-forward cruiser that both brand and customer hope it will be, with excellent materials, fabulous presentation and a segment-busting 48-inch panoramic screen.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Nautilus makes mincemeat of the neglected Cadillac XT5, is cushier than its German rivals and out-styles the Lexus RX — just keep an eye on the options list, as Lincoln will happily boost the top Black Label trim above $80,000.\n\nStoried American luxury brand Lincoln has reinvented itself a handful of times over the past 30 years, and its latest revitalization seems to have stuck. In some ways, it’s a brand that loyal Lincoln customers of the 1950s and ‘60s would recognize, at least in ethos; today’s Lincoln lineup is populated by stylish, design-forward SUVs with elegant interior decor that make no pretense about purpose. Unlike its most direct competition, Lincoln has no performance trims. Heck, it has no performance aspirations. There are powerful Lincolns, sure, but those are meant to tow the moon while effortlessly shuttling a full house and baggage, not blaze through the quarter-mile.\n\nRelated: 2024 Lincoln Nautilus Up Close: How About a Mobile IMAX?\n\nThe 2024 Nautilus embodies the brand’s purposeful positioning. The mid-century modern playground that is Palm Springs, Calif., provided the perfect setting for our first drive of the new Nautilus, with its reserved, tinsel-free exterior threads blending in with the moneyed, Rolls-rich traffic while the gorgeous leather-wrapped cockpit drips with details and creature comforts. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nLuxurious Isolation Chamber\n\nThe interior really is the Nautilus’ showpiece, but technology defines modern luxury as much (or more) than materials. So, Lincoln fitted its fresh mid-sizer with a class-leading 48-inch panoramic display that stretches “coast to coast” across the dashboard. Visually impressive and high-fidelity, the massive screen acts a bit like a physical head-up display with customizable layouts for critical information like navigation route, weather, driver-assist systems and any media apps you might want immediately on hand.\n\nAnd that’s just for the passenger side. The majority of the driver’s-screen real estate handles the expected functions of a digital instrument panel. For all primary infotainment functions, including navigation setup, vehicle settings and media selection, there’s an additional, lower-mounted 11.1-inch touchscreen. It’s very 2024, but don’t let that distract you from the stylish controls and structural surfaces that wear a sheen of handsome retrofuturism. The squircle steering wheel is charming, complementing a suite of buttery extended upholstery that includes an uncommonly plush microsuede headliner and tight contrast stitching throughout the cabin. There are sharp little details peppered around the cockpit, too, from “crystal-inspired” glass hardware to an active scent diffuser to little metal trim accents on the floormats.\n\nThere is a fair bit of plastic trim present — most controls and glossy piano-black surfaces come to mind — but it’s of a quality matching the Nautilus’ $50,000-and-up price tag, to a point. For maximum aesthetic impact, I suggest opting for the range-topping (but rather pricey) Black Label trim. That’s the only way to land the exclusive (and very attractive) Chalet or Redwood interior themes. With either theme, rear passengers are similarly equipped for comfort, with reclining rear seats, quad USB-C charge ports, climate controls, available heated seats and impressive legroom even behind my 5-foot-11-inch seating position. They also get a clear earful of the optional 28-speaker Revel Ultima 3D stereo that comes standard on Reserve II and Black Label variants, but I’m afraid only front occupants can take advantage of the available massaging seats.\n\nFabulous on Style, Good on Substance\n\nA turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for 250 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque is standard, as are all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. A premium hybrid drivetrain adds a 134-hp electric motor to the turbo 2.0-liter for a combined 310 hp and 295 pounds-feet, and boosts EPA-rated fuel economy to 30/31/30 mpg city/highway/combined from 21/29/24 mpg in the gas-only Nautilus.\n\nOut on the pine-lined stretches of mountainous road outside Idyllwild, Calif., power from the standard gas engine was never more than just adequate. Two occupants in the car were enough to make reaching merging and passing speeds a safe but conscious exercise, one that was significantly improved by the more powerful hybrid drivetrain. The efficient configuration is also the one to pick for leadfoots and people haulers, with 310 hp providing strong passing acceleration and quickish cruising.\n\nRegardless of which powertrain you have, noise and vibration from extended full-throttle rips were well isolated — more so in the hybrid. Still, the trade-off for electrification is a continuously variable automatic transmission and all the accompanying sustained drivetrain thrash; the traditional eight-speed auto in the gas-only Nautilus was smooth, unobtrusive and prioritized keeping revs to a minimum even under moderate acceleration.\n\nAside from an Excite driving mode, the new Nautilus has zero performance ambitions — but we hucked it down the famous Pines to Palms Highway (California State Route 74) anyway. The adaptive suspension and decently weighted steering proved more than capable for the crossover’s intended purpose, and it should make that annual trip up the mountain pass to the family cabin or ski lodge a composed and confident affair. Can it keep up with other German SUVs in its price bracket? Who cares?\n\nDialed back into Normal mode, the ride possesses the muted, pillowy quality expected of Lincoln’s trademark refinement. Body composure is well managed, and small-to-moderate bumps seem to get lost in a vat of syrup en route to the driver’s rear end. Brake inputs on the gas model are smooth and easy to modulate, but I found regenerative brake blending on the hybrid to be noticeably touchy, with high pedal sensitivity, mushy regen tip-in and too-grabby engagement when the physical brakes first clamp — not ideal when the rest of the car is markedly silky.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nStunning Pricing for Stunning 2024 Lincoln Nautilus Starts at $51,810\n2024 Lincoln Nautilus: A Stunning Display of Stunning Display\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Up Close: Mostly Just More of a Good Thing\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Preview: More Tech for More Money\nIs the 2023 Lincoln Corsair a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nAway from tight alpine roads and on the tremendously dull, straight and clogged Interstate 10, the Nautilus did a fantastic impression of an Eames lounge chair. Dark, roiling clouds threatened rain, causing predictably skittish Southern California drivers to needlessly slow down and jam. Lincoln’s BlueCruise came to the rescue; under the right circumstances, this suite of active, adaptive cruise control offers hands-free driving, and I was happy to let the Nautilus handle the congestion in my stead. BlueCruise had no significant interlane ping-ponging, no sketchy braking mishaps and no scary steering kerfuffles requiring real correction during this portion of my drive. Provided most of your highway route supports it, it’s easy to imagine this carves off a fair share of stress and frustration.\n\nMid-Century Modern at Modern Prices\n\nThat’s really the best summation of the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus. At least in the top trims we sampled, it’s precisely the stylish, leather-lined, tech-forward isolation chamber both brand and customer hope it will be. Be careful with the order form, however, as the very reasonable $52,010 starting price can quickly spiral to the Black Label’s low $80,000 range.\n\nIs it worth it? That’s going to require some soul (and couch cushion) searching. It has great tech, distinct style and excellent materials. If it fits your budget, I see no reason why it shouldn’t make your shortlist.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nThe Lincoln Nautilus is a five-seat luxury mid-size SUV that aims to provide a coddling driving experience and a tech-forward cabin. The interior is highlighted by a 48-inch instrument panel/infotainment screen that spans the width of the dashboard. The standard drivetrain is a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. An available hybrid version of the base engine makes 310 hp and returns an EPA-estimated 30 mpg in combined city/highway driving. The Nautilus’ competitors include the Genesis GV80, Lexus RX, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, and Volvo XC90.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nAfter a complete redesign for 2024, the ’25 Nautilus arrives with a few notable updates. Lincoln’s BlueCruise hands-free driving system is now complimentary for the first four years of ownership. Available on the Reserve trim and standard on the line-topping Black Label is a Lincoln Rejuvenate mood-enhancing system, which allows customized settings for massaging front seats, screen visuals, cabin lighting and even an onboard scent diffuser. It’s meant to provide a spa-like experience, albeit only when the Nautilus is in Park.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lincoln Nautilus Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n48-inch panoramic dashboard display\n11.1-inch touchscreen\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nVoice commands\nFour USB ports\nNavigation\nSatellite radio\nWireless charging pad\nPower liftgate\nBlueCruise hands-free highway driving assist\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nRear seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassaging front seats\nHeated outboard rear seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nOnboard scent diffuser\n28-speaker Revel stereo\nHands-free power liftgate\n22-inch alloy wheels\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nThe Nautilus offers a distinctive personality in a class chock full of impressive choices. While it sports a handsomely restrained exterior, the interior truly stands out. The full-width dashboard display looks spectacular and should dazzle tech-centric shoppers, but it might be overkill for some consumers. Rear legroom is excellent, and cargo room exceeds what you’ll find in many competing luxury mid-size SUVs. We wouldn’t mind more power from the regular gas drivetrain, however, and a few ho-hum interior trim pieces can be spotted in the priciest range-topping models. Unlike some class rivals, the Nautilus prioritizes a cushy ride over cornering prowess, but its ride can be wallowy over bumps and undulating pavement. All in all, the Nautilus is a cosseting and tech-rich choice that’s worth consideration.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nThe 2023 Lincoln Nautilus is a mid-size luxury SUV with two rows of seats, a choice of turbo four-cylinder or V-6 engines, and front- or all-wheel drive. For SUV shoppers who want a relaxed and hushed ride, the calm demeanor of the Nautilus could be a perfect match. It doesn’t have the taut suspension and pinpoint handling of some rivals, but the Nautilus has a base price that’s notably less expensive than many similarly sized premium SUVs. A roomy cabin and large cargo hold are further pluses, as are the intuitive Sync 4 infotainment system and 13.2-inch touchscreen.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nLincoln has added a new Premium Package for the entry-level Standard trim level. This includes features like navigation, a universal garage door opener and a power-adjustable steering column. Other than that, the 2023 Nautilus is unchanged save a new exterior color, Jewel Sandstone.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lincoln Nautilus Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\n10-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nAdaptive suspension\n19-speaker Revel audio system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lincoln Nautilus?\n\nThe Lincoln Nautilus is a strong contender among five-seat luxury SUVs, especially for anyone who prioritizes driving comfort over pure sportiness. The standard 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is more than adequate, but the extra passing oomph from the optional 335-hp, 2.7-liter turbo V-6 make it a worthy upgrade. The Nautilus also has a handsome cabin that only gets better when you upgrade to a Reserve or Black Label trim.",

      "expert_review": "Back in 2019, Lincoln began updating all of its model names, banishing the silliness of MKC, MKT, MKS, MKX, etc., in favor of actually memorable words like Continental, Aviator, Nautilus and Corsair. The SUV you see here used to be the MKX, but two years ago, Lincoln switched it to Nautilus, a definite improvement — but apparently the brand blew all the budget that year on the name change and a mild face-lift to give it the same face as the Aviator and Navigator, because the interior was left untouched.\n\nFast forward to 2021, and we have another “mid-cycle refresh” for the Nautilus, but this time Lincoln has finally upgraded the interior to match the luxurious artistry of the rest of the Lincoln showroom. It’s a welcome upgrade and addresses the last bastion of the old, pre-upgraded Lincoln lineup, but is it good enough to command the rather significant prices that Lincoln wants for the new 2021 Nautilus?\n\nRelated: 2021 Lincoln Nautilus: Subtle Changes, Nicer Digs\n\nThe Unchanged Part\n\nFirst things first: If the 2021 Nautilus doesn’t look any different to you than the 2020 model, that’s not surprising. Lincoln last updated the sheet metal for the 2019 model year, giving it the familial horseshoe-shaped grille and headlight treatment seen on the rest of the lineup, and it looks just as good now as it did then. The overall exterior styling is very attractive, subtly muscular, with a full-width taillight that adds to the SUV’s sleek lines. One thing to note: The styling tricks used by Lincoln make the Nautilus look bigger than it actually is. This is a mid-size two-row luxury SUV, but it’s on the small side of the category — for more space (and a change to rear-wheel drive), go for the three-row Aviator instead.\n\nThe powertrain is also unchanged from the prior model, and that’s just fine, too. The standard engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 250 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque, run through an eight-speed automatic transmission powering the front wheels (all-wheel drive is optional on base models). That’s also the standard engine that powers the mid-level Reserve trim, but if you opt for the top-level Black Label trim, you get a twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 that pumps out a very healthy 335 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque and standard all-wheel drive (this powertrain combo is optional on the Reserve trim). The bigger V-6 is torquey and smooth, delivering a considerable rush of power when called upon, but doesn’t feel as quick as its numbers would suggest — likely due to the 4,500 pounds that it has to haul around. \n\nThe Nautilus is not tuned for sportiness. Lincoln’s ethos is built around the idea of Quiet Flight, and frankly, that to me sounds like a much better idea for a lineup consisting almost entirely of SUVs than the sport models that many other luxury brands are pushing. SUVs are terrible sports cars, but they’re excellent luxury cruisers, so why not tune your vehicles to be comfortable instead of hairy-chested? Anyone truly seeking a sporting experience isn’t likely buying an SUV anyway, so the fact that the Nautilus combines a compliant ride, heavy-but-stable steering and a relaxed accelerator response doesn’t offend me. Driving it is a relaxing experience, like luxury cars used to be before reviewers decided that everything needed to be a super-engaging driving experience. Those experiences have their place, but Lincoln is having none of it, and it results in an SUV that does its job pretty well — not perfectly, as there is still a surprising amount of wind noise at highway speeds, but it’s not overly intrusive. \n\nThe Redesigned Bits\n\nInside is where all the efforts went for the 2021 model year, and it shows in what has become a  beautifully crafted, lovely-to-look-at and pleasant-to-touch interior. If you like the way the other Lincoln interiors look, you’ll like this one, too — they all have the same design aesthetic. It’s a horizontally oriented theme with a single spar that spans the width of the cabin, featuring a large touchscreen plopped atop it within easy reach and view. Lincoln’s signature piano key transmission shifter is also there, and while I’m not big on most push-button shifters, for some reason the Lincoln version seems just fine — I credit the simple design, large buttons and easy-to-read lettering. There’s no trying to figure out what you push or what you pull; it’s a simple push-button affair and it’s easy to use quickly, which has been the issue I’ve had with most other push-button shifters. \n\nThe interior itself definitely benefits from the upgraded materials. The last Nautilus interior wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t yet at the level that Lincoln has been doing for the Aviator and Navigator — now, it is. The leather in this Black Label trim was sumptuous, the stitching in the dash and doors was arrow straight, and the wood, metal and plastic all finally feel premium. No more warmed over Ford interiors for Lincoln. \n\nThe new multimedia system is also a welcome update. The screen is now a huge 13.2-inch unit running the latest Sync 4, the first time the system has appeared in a Lincoln vehicle (it will likely proliferate through the rest of the line over the next few years). It comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the size of the screen means you can have a very large display for those peripheral apps and still have a smaller native display onscreen at the same time. The Sync 4 system also gets “Lincolnized” with its own unique colors, patterns and visual effects to differentiate it from the Ford version you can find in the latest F-150 pickup. A fun Easter egg: Selecting between screens with a touch to the corresponding area creates a sparkle effect, part of what Lincoln calls its Constellation theme. \n\nAnd as before, the highlight of the interior experience is still the Revel premium audio system. The standard system in the Black Label trim is the Revel Ultima system, which features 19 speakers arranged throughout the cabin. I’m not exaggerating when I call this quite possibly the best audio system fitted to an automobile today. It features amazing range and clarity, with lows that you viscerally feel, combined with crystal-clear highs that truly bring music to life. My only wish for the system is that the Nautilus itself were a bit quieter — the highway wind and road noise aren’t exactly intrusive, but better environmental silencing would enhance the Revel system even more. \n\nStill Room for Improvement\n\nAs well done as the interior is, however, there are two areas that still need some love. The first is the digital gauge cluster, which sports remarkably boring, oddly retro-looking bronze numerals on a huge black background. It comes off as unfinished, like Ford isn’t using the display to its true potential, and if you’ve seen the digital display in the latest Ford Mustang, you’ll know what I mean. That gauge cluster is vastly more customizable than the Lincoln screen, with color and design choices aplenty — why this nearly $70,000 luxury SUV doesn’t have something more visually interesting and customizable is a mystery to me. \n\nThe other area that could use some love is the Nautilus’ seat design. The seat bottom cushions feel short and narrow, and while the Black Label’s adjustable seats do have a thigh-extension function, this only helps a little. They’re also not terribly comfortable — you don’t sink into these seats at all; it truly feels like you’re riding atop them. They have a convex feel to the bottom and back cushions that might be there to simulate some support, but which feel like you’re sitting on beach balls after a few miles. Ford and Lincoln seat design has been a common complaint over the years for us, so this is sadly not a new issue. There’s plenty of room for occupants front and rear, although rear legroom can be a bit tight. It’s what drives us to classify the Nautilus on the smaller end of the two-row SUV category, but it’s still comfortable for four people, five in a pinch.\n\nPriced to Compete, Not to Be a Bargain\n\nStarting prices for the 2021 Lincoln Nautilus begin in the low $40,000 range and can extend up to nearly $70,000 for a loaded Black Label trim. At the low end, that’s quite reasonable, but at the high end, that’s a pretty dear price for a smallish mid-size SUV of any type. Still, with the right lease deals, the new Nautilus is competitively priced in its field, and now that it features an interior that matches its exterior style, it’s less of a stretch to justify that lofty price to buyers wondering what makes this Lincoln worth the money. Most of the latest Lincolns justify their higher prices through that exceptional cabin, and the new ’21 Nautilus is no different. It’s an outstanding upgrade to a model that should now land it on more shoppers’ consideration lists. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Lincoln Nautilus offers some compelling features, but its price tag climbs quickly, leaving interior quality behind.\n\nVersus the competition: Luxury competitors are more refined, but the Nautilus offers a large interior and good driving experience with the V-6.\n\nThe 2019 Lincoln Nautilus has a brand-new name, but it isn’t a brand-new vehicle; “Nautilus” is a new moniker for the Lincoln MKX mid-size crossover. The new name does come with a few updates, though this is a refresh and not a full-on redesign like you’d see with most name changes. Compare the Nautilus with last year’s MKX here.\n\nThe five-seat Nautilus looks similar to the MKX. The easiest way to distinguish it from the previous model is the new horizontal grille, which replaces Lincoln’s older split grille. The Nautilus also looks a lot like the Lincoln MKC, Lincoln’s compact SUV. Even though the latter is smaller, it’s hard to tell them apart even when parked close together. There’s also a new base engine, but the optional engine carries over — and that’s a good thing.\n\nCompetition for the Nautilus is varied given its price and image (in some eyes, at least) as a near-luxury as opposed to full-luxury vehicle. The Nautilus starts at $41,335 for base models, then jumps to $45,540 for the Select, $49,870 for the Reserve and $57,890 for the Black Label, which in turn comes in three varieties: Chalet, Gala and Thoroughbred. (All prices include destination charges.) On the lower end, it competes with smaller luxury SUVs like the Audi Q5 and other mid-size two-row SUVs like the Lexus RX 350 and Cadillac XT5. Compare the Nautilus with those vehicles here.\n\nThe Nautilus has a dual nature: There are luxurious aspects that justify its price, but also parts that feel less than premium and drag down the experience.\n\nTwo Engine Choices, One Good One\n\nThis dichotomy starts under the hood. The new base engine is a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 280 pounds-feet of torque. This replaces last year’s base V-6. For those who want more get-up-and-go, an optional 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 that makes 380 pounds-feet of torque is available. While both engines come mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions, the gearboxes are unique; Lincoln says each has different ratios and other mechanical changes that alter how they behave.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. The all-wheel drive has added a provision that disengages the rear driveshaft when it’s not needed. Translation: It functions like front-wheel drive most of the time, which is more efficient, but sends power to the rear wheels when needed. I found the system to work seamlessly on the road, moving power to the back wheels under heavy acceleration without hesitation, then going right back to FWD when the need was over. Fuel-economy ratings with FWD are 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for the base engine and 20/27/22 mpg for the V-6. AWD models are close, at 20/25/22 mpg for the base engine and 19/26/21 mpg for the V-6.\n\nThe Nautilus doesn’t offer an extensive sport mode, but hitting S on the gear selector makes the powertrain more responsive. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nOf the two engine options, the V-6 is the way to go. The base engine is plenty powerful, but its transmission seems to get in the way and accelerator inputs are muted — there’s a discernible lag between pressing the pedal and the Nautilus moving forward with any urgency. Once the engine gets going, there’s enough grunt to scoot pretty well, but the delay is off-putting. The Nautilus does offer a more aggressive “S” (Sport) mode on the gear selector, which helps keep the engine a bit higher up in the rev range, but it doesn’t solve the problem completely and makes the engine drone noticeably.\n\nConversely, the V-6 and its transmission are a potent combination. The pedal feels in sync with the powertrain, power comes immediately, and the transmission shifts crisply and does a good job staying in the right gear. It feels like a luxury powertrain should, with easy acceleration and plenty of go-go for passing on the highway. Even with a suspension and steering definitely tuned for comfort, the Nautilus was good for a few smiles with the V-6 under the hood.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: The Nautilus’ powertrain upgrades are always optional, not standard on any trim level. That means it’s possible to get a Black Label SUV with the base powertrain and FWD. Adding the optional engine adds $2,070 to the base price, and AWD adds another $2,495, meaning it’s always a $4,565 premium to get the Nautilus’ ideal engine setup.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nInside, the Nautilus has a mix of materials that simultaneously awe and sadden. Each of the Nautilus models I drove were from the Reserve trim level and up, so they featured one of several shades of open-pore wood trim and soft, supple leather on the seats. I also tested the optional “Ultra Comfort” 22-way powered front seats, and they were just as comfortable as you’d hope seats with such a ridiculous amount of adjustment would be.\n\nWhen you move your attention to the center console, however, things are less positive. Even on the line-topping Black Label model, the controls are thin plastic and feel like they’re from a Ford Edge. The front storage bin door is especially flimsy, and the climate buttons are plastic rather than metal, which is what you’ll find in most luxury competitors. The touchscreen, though, is great: Resolution is high enough, and it’s powered by Sync 3, one of my favorite multimedia systems thanks to its simplicity, ease of use and standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe backseat is spacious, with 39.6 inches of legroom — more than any of the competitors mentioned above. Headroom is also ample. The Nautilus offers a gigantic panoramic moonroof, which keeps the cabin feeling airy for everyone inside. Behind the rear seats, you’ll find 37.2 cubic feet of cargo room, which (again) blows away the competitors. Handy controls lower the rear seats if you need more cargo space.\n\nThe only thing the backseat is missing is charging options; the only two USB ports are located up front. Opting for the Cargo Utility Package adds a household outlet to the backseat, but otherwise, there’s just a 12-volt outlet back there.\n\nSafety for a Price\nMost of the safety features can be turned on and off within the instrument panel screen, via controls on the steering wheel. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe Nautilus offers an extensive amount of safety equipment (there’s the good), but it’s expensive (there’s the bad). Forward automatic emergency braking and a blind spot warning system are standard, but after that, things get a bit more complicated. The crown jewel is the Driver Assistance Package ($1,590), which includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist with lane centering, adaptive steering ratios and — a new feature for 2019 — evasive steering assist. Evasive steering can detect slower-moving or stopped obstacles in the Nautilus’ path, and when the driver initiates a turn to avoid the object, the system is ready to boost the steering to help out. It works at all speeds, thus effective in both city and highway driving.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is offered only on Reserve and higher trim levels. In a market where safety features are being increasingly democratized, such limited availability is strange. Also available are a 360-degree camera system and an active park assist function.\n\nMissing Value\nI was hoping for more luxury for the $60,000-plus price tag of the Reserve model I tested. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe price on the Nautilus skyrockets quickly. All the examples I tested — even ones with the base engine — had sticker prices of more than $60,000. That’s a lot to pay for an SUV that doesn’t have full luxury credentials. They were also missing some standard safety equipment I’d like to see at that price, especially considering that the Ford Edge, essentially a sibling to the Nautilus, comes with many of those features standard at a significantly lower price.\n\nUltimately, this is what gives me pause about the 2019 Nautilus. What you get isn’t bad, but at these prices, “not bad” isn’t good enough. Lincoln has shown it can make true luxury SUVs (the Navigator and forthcoming Aviator), but the Nautilus doesn’t qualify.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Lincoln Nautilus offers some compelling features, but its price tag climbs quickly, leaving interior quality behind.\n\nVersus the competition: Luxury competitors are more refined, but the Nautilus offers a large interior and good driving experience with the V-6.\n\nThe 2019 Lincoln Nautilus has a brand-new name, but it isn’t a brand-new vehicle; “Nautilus” is a new moniker for the Lincoln MKX mid-size crossover. The new name does come with a few updates, though this is a refresh and not a full-on redesign like you’d see with most name changes. Compare the Nautilus with last year’s MKX here.\n\nThe five-seat Nautilus looks similar to the MKX. The easiest way to distinguish it from the previous model is the new horizontal grille, which replaces Lincoln’s older split grille. The Nautilus also looks a lot like the Lincoln MKC, Lincoln’s compact SUV. Even though the latter is smaller, it’s hard to tell them apart even when parked close together. There’s also a new base engine, but the optional engine carries over — and that’s a good thing.\n\nCompetition for the Nautilus is varied given its price and image (in some eyes, at least) as a near-luxury as opposed to full-luxury vehicle. The Nautilus starts at $41,335 for base models, then jumps to $45,540 for the Select, $49,870 for the Reserve and $57,890 for the Black Label, which in turn comes in three varieties: Chalet, Gala and Thoroughbred. (All prices include destination charges.) On the lower end, it competes with smaller luxury SUVs like the Audi Q5 and other mid-size two-row SUVs like the Lexus RX 350 and Cadillac XT5. Compare the Nautilus with those vehicles here.\n\nThe Nautilus has a dual nature: There are luxurious aspects that justify its price, but also parts that feel less than premium and drag down the experience.\n\nTwo Engine Choices, One Good One\n\nThis dichotomy starts under the hood. The new base engine is a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 280 pounds-feet of torque. This replaces last year’s base V-6. For those who want more get-up-and-go, an optional 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 that makes 380 pounds-feet of torque is available. While both engines come mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions, the gearboxes are unique; Lincoln says each has different ratios and other mechanical changes that alter how they behave.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. The all-wheel drive has added a provision that disengages the rear driveshaft when it’s not needed. Translation: It functions like front-wheel drive most of the time, which is more efficient, but sends power to the rear wheels when needed. I found the system to work seamlessly on the road, moving power to the back wheels under heavy acceleration without hesitation, then going right back to FWD when the need was over. Fuel-economy ratings with FWD are 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined for the base engine and 20/27/22 mpg for the V-6. AWD models are close, at 20/25/22 mpg for the base engine and 19/26/21 mpg for the V-6.\n\nThe Nautilus doesn’t offer an extensive sport mode, but hitting S on the gear selector makes the powertrain more responsive. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nOf the two engine options, the V-6 is the way to go. The base engine is plenty powerful, but its transmission seems to get in the way and accelerator inputs are muted — there’s a discernible lag between pressing the pedal and the Nautilus moving forward with any urgency. Once the engine gets going, there’s enough grunt to scoot pretty well, but the delay is off-putting. The Nautilus does offer a more aggressive “S” (Sport) mode on the gear selector, which helps keep the engine a bit higher up in the rev range, but it doesn’t solve the problem completely and makes the engine drone noticeably.\n\nConversely, the V-6 and its transmission are a potent combination. The pedal feels in sync with the powertrain, power comes immediately, and the transmission shifts crisply and does a good job staying in the right gear. It feels like a luxury powertrain should, with easy acceleration and plenty of go-go for passing on the highway. Even with a suspension and steering definitely tuned for comfort, the Nautilus was good for a few smiles with the V-6 under the hood.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: The Nautilus’ powertrain upgrades are always optional, not standard on any trim level. That means it’s possible to get a Black Label SUV with the base powertrain and FWD. Adding the optional engine adds $2,070 to the base price, and AWD adds another $2,495, meaning it’s always a $4,565 premium to get the Nautilus’ ideal engine setup.\n\nInterior Hits and Misses\n\nInside, the Nautilus has a mix of materials that simultaneously awe and sadden. Each of the Nautilus models I drove were from the Reserve trim level and up, so they featured one of several shades of open-pore wood trim and soft, supple leather on the seats. I also tested the optional “Ultra Comfort” 22-way powered front seats, and they were just as comfortable as you’d hope seats with such a ridiculous amount of adjustment would be.\n\nWhen you move your attention to the center console, however, things are less positive. Even on the line-topping Black Label model, the controls are thin plastic and feel like they’re from a Ford Edge. The front storage bin door is especially flimsy, and the climate buttons are plastic rather than metal, which is what you’ll find in most luxury competitors. The touchscreen, though, is great: Resolution is high enough, and it’s powered by Sync 3, one of my favorite multimedia systems thanks to its simplicity, ease of use and standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe backseat is spacious, with 39.6 inches of legroom — more than any of the competitors mentioned above. Headroom is also ample. The Nautilus offers a gigantic panoramic moonroof, which keeps the cabin feeling airy for everyone inside. Behind the rear seats, you’ll find 37.2 cubic feet of cargo room, which (again) blows away the competitors. Handy controls lower the rear seats if you need more cargo space.\n\nThe only thing the backseat is missing is charging options; the only two USB ports are located up front. Opting for the Cargo Utility Package adds a household outlet to the backseat, but otherwise, there’s just a 12-volt outlet back there.\n\nSafety for a Price\nMost of the safety features can be turned on and off within the instrument panel screen, via controls on the steering wheel. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe Nautilus offers an extensive amount of safety equipment (there’s the good), but it’s expensive (there’s the bad). Forward automatic emergency braking and a blind spot warning system are standard, but after that, things get a bit more complicated. The crown jewel is the Driver Assistance Package ($1,590), which includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist with lane centering, adaptive steering ratios and — a new feature for 2019 — evasive steering assist. Evasive steering can detect slower-moving or stopped obstacles in the Nautilus’ path, and when the driver initiates a turn to avoid the object, the system is ready to boost the steering to help out. It works at all speeds, thus effective in both city and highway driving.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is offered only on Reserve and higher trim levels. In a market where safety features are being increasingly democratized, such limited availability is strange. Also available are a 360-degree camera system and an active park assist function.\n\nMissing Value\nI was hoping for more luxury for the $60,000-plus price tag of the Reserve model I tested. | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe price on the Nautilus skyrockets quickly. All the examples I tested — even ones with the base engine — had sticker prices of more than $60,000. That’s a lot to pay for an SUV that doesn’t have full luxury credentials. They were also missing some standard safety equipment I’d like to see at that price, especially considering that the Ford Edge, essentially a sibling to the Nautilus, comes with many of those features standard at a significantly lower price.\n\nUltimately, this is what gives me pause about the 2019 Nautilus. What you get isn’t bad, but at these prices, “not bad” isn’t good enough. Lincoln has shown it can make true luxury SUVs (the Navigator and forthcoming Aviator), but the Nautilus doesn’t qualify.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
