      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMeant to attract a younger, luxury-minded audience, Lincoln’s LS sedan received suspension revisions to improve noise, vibration and harshness for the 2004 model year. Power-adjustable pedals joined the options list for 2005. Side curtain-type airbags and extended rear parking assist were made optional for all LS models. Lincoln said the automatic transmission was modified to produce smoother shifts.\n\nA simplified 2006 lineup includes just one model: the V-8 Sport. Some design elements from last year’s LSE Appearance Package, including a chrome grille with body-colored surround, round fog lamps and body-colored rear license-plate trim, have been incorporated into the 2006 sedan. Two new 17-inch wheel designs are available. Optional Elite and Premium packages make popular equipment available.\n\nIntroduced for the 2000 model year, the rear-wheel-drive LS sedan is based on the same platform as the Jaguar S-Type. Competitors include the Acura TL, Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and Lexus’ ES 330, GS 300 and GS 430.\n\nExterior\nLike Lincoln’s larger Town Car sedan, the LS has a vertical-bar grille with a full-perimeter chrome surround. Unlike the rounded, sweeping shape of the S-Type, the LS has a gentle slope to its roof pillars and a slight wedge profile overall. One-piece rocker moldings are installed. High-intensity-discharge headlights and a moonroof are optional.\n\nLincoln claims near 50/50 weight distribution for the LS, which features a sport-tuned suspension. Riding a 114.5-inch wheelbase, the LS is 194.4 inches long overall, 73.2 inches wide and 56.4 inches tall. The Town Car is nearly 22 inches longer. Five-spoke aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nThe five-passenger LS sedan has front bucket seats and a floor-mounted gearshift lever. Leather seating surfaces are standard. The interior is trimmed with aluminum accents or real American walnut burl. The front seats have ample space for tall occupants, with standard power adjustment and lumbar support. A power tilt/telescoping steering column helps tailor the driving position.\n\nBackseat passengers also have adequate room, but the middle rear position is higher, harder and impaired by the tall drive-shaft tunnel. Split, rear seatbacks fold down for additional cargo space. The trunk has a long, wide floor and is easy to load, but it holds a relatively modest 13.5 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nStandard features include dual-zone automatic temperature control with air filtration, a cassette/CD stereo and an electric parking brake. Heated and cooled front seats are available, and an optional navigation system includes Soundmark THX-Certified audio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nOnly one engine is available for 2006: a 3.9-liter V-8 that cranks out 280 horsepower and 286 pounds-feet of torque. Lincoln no longer offers V-6 power. The V-8 uses premium fuel and teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a SelectShift provision for manually selectable gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats, antilock brakes, electronic brake-force distribution and all-speed traction control are standard. An AdvanceTrac electronic stability system and side curtain-type airbags are available. Rear parking assist is optional.",

      "expert_review": "Lincoln’s LS fits the European mold. The best way to describe the Lincoln LS is to think of it as an American BMW.\n\nThis front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sedan is an amalgam of balanced handling, understated luxury and over-the-road performance, things which are not usually part of the definition of a Lincoln. Until recently, the Lincoln name has been synonymous with couchlike comfort, and it brings to mind images of a Town Car or Navigator.\n\nLincoln is recasting its brand to appeal to younger customers. The Navigator has done a lot to bring in new, and younger, buyers, while the upcoming Blackwood, a cross between the Navigator and a luxury pickup truck, will continue to do the same.\n\nThe smaller, sporty LS, however, is capable of luring buyers into a showroom they might not normally visit. It competes very nicely against the BMW 5-series, Lexus GS 300, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz C-class. There are two powertrains, a 3.0-liter V-6 and a 3.9-liter V-8. The V-6 is even offered in a sport package with a five-speed manual transmission. Prices, including delivery, start at $32,275 for a V-6 automatic, $34,055 for the V-6 Sport with five-speed and $36,305 for the V-8.\n\nThe test car was a V-8 fitted with the Sport package, a $1,990 option that includes 17-inch wheels, European suspension and an Alpine Sport audio system with an in-dash, six CD changer.\n\nIt’s not surprising that the LS has a very European feel, because it shares a good portion of its mechanical DNA with the Jaguar S-Type. Both cars are built on the same basic chassis platform, with similar suspension and powertrain packages, although the Jag’s versions of the engines are more powerful. Even the 2002 Thunderbird uses a variation of the same underpinnings.\n\nThe traditional Lincoln buyer who loves his or her Town Car probably won’t take a shine to the LS because the interior is relatively compact and the ride firm, but those folks really aren’t the ones for whom this car is designed.\n\nFrom the outset, the LS was designed with a 50/50 weight balance for optimum handling. Aluminum is widely used throughout the suspension to reduce weight, and the battery is located in the trunk for better weight distribution. Anti-dive suspension geometry keeps the LS flat under acceleration and braking. The fully independent front and rear suspension soaks up bumps and makes the LS as quick on its feet as any of its European competitors. In fact, it outshines many of them when driven hard. It is positively delightful in turns and makes fast tracks down the interstate. The only sweat you’ll break is when you notice you’re zipping along at 80 miles per hour when it feels like 70.\n\nThe four-wheel disc brakes are vented to keep them from fading under heavy use. Anti-lock is standard, as is all-speed traction control. Ford’s Advance Trac vehicle stability system is a $735 option that helps keep the vehicle under control in skids and emergency accident avoidance situations.\n\nExte rnal styling is modest, and intentionally so. Short front and rear overhangs, as well as a long, 114.5-inch wheelbase, give it a muscular profile. The sharp “bone” lines that run from the top of the front fenders back along the cabin carry a hint of athleticism and add visual interest.\n\nIf there’s any letdown with the LS, it is inside. Even though the wood trim, leather seats and gauges are nicely done, sections of the instrument panel aren’t as luxurious as some of its rivals. The radio and climate controls, for example, don’t look that much different than a Taurus. That doesn’t really bother me, but for a car in this price segment a little more elegance would be welcome.\n\nThe climate control system has dual controls so each front-seat passenger can select their own temperature, and there are rear-seat ventilation outlets on the back of the center console.\n\nComfort while driving is a high priority, and the front seats were firm, but not hard. Lateral and lumbar support was q te good.\n\nThe 60/40, folding rear seat is useful for expanding cargo room. Rear-seat legroom is not overly generous, considering the lengthy wheelbase, but it is certainly adequate for adult passengers.\n\nThe LS puts Lincoln in position to expand its customer base by offering a driver’s car in the European idiom.\n\nPrice The list price of the test car was $35,695. The Sport package, power moonroof, heated front seats, Advance Trac and delivery charges brought the sticker price to $40,435.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.\n\n{Point:} The LS is LincolnÕs answer to European and Japanese sport//luxury cars. It is the opposite of a Town Car because crisp handling and understated elegance are its trademarks. {Counterpoint:} Traditional Lincoln buyers might find the styling to be too plain and the cabin too small.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 3.9-liter V-8\nTransmission: automatic Rear-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 114.5 inches\nCurb weight: 3,692 lbs.\nBase price: $35,695\nAs driven: $40,435\nMpg rating: 17 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "If the Navigator is the beef, then the LS is the brie in Lincoln’s recipe for redefining itself and updating its product line with models that appeal to buyers who are younger and hipper than those who queue up to purchase a Town Car.\n\nPrices start at $31,450 for the V6 with a 5-speed, $32,250 for the V6 with an automatic and $35,225 for the V8 and automatic transmission.\n\nThe LS, as well as the Navigator, is a magnet for a new kind of Lincoln customer, one that is likely to be in the 30 to 50 age group, Internet savvy and likely to be moving up from an imported car such as a Camry or Accord. Dealerships will have to take a new approach to selling these folks.\n\nTo accomplish that will take massive changes in the Lincoln corporate culture. To that end, Lincoln took over Treasure Island, near San Francisco, in April. For three weeks 125 people completely transformed old airplane hangars into multilevel, high-tech displays, called Exploriums, that were used to train 3,000 top executives from Lincoln dealerships. The 18-day, multimillion dollar program was a daylong series of lectures, videos and test drives that taught them why the LS is special. On 13 different test tracks they sampled the LS and compared it to many of its imported competitors.\n\nLincoln describes the car responsible for all of this training as a “watershed” vehicle it intends to sell around the world. According to officials, the Euro-inspired LS marries “superb driving dynamics” with “contemporary American luxury” in a front-engine, rear-drive configuration. Under its tightly tailored skin lies many of the same mechanical components found in the S-Type Jaguar (also owned by Ford). Although the company downplayed the commonality, about 40 to 45 percent of the parts are shared. Lincoln execs explained that everything you can “see, touch, feel or smell” is unique to the Lincoln.\n\nThe same engine/chassis combination will be used for the new Thunderbird, and perhaps even the next-generation Mustang.\n\nAutomotive writers were given an abbreviated tour of the Treasure Island facility during the launch, but our driving included a trip into Northern California where we put the LS and many of its competitors through their paces on a small club racetrack.\n\nAt this venue the LS gave its overseas competitors a real challenge. Young engineers, many from Ford Motor Company’s racing involvement with CART and Formula One, were selected to work on the LS program, and as a result the car handles impeccably.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes and traction control are crucial to keeping all four wheels in constant contact with the road. An optional stability enhancement system ($725) applies one or more brakes to correct slides and keep the car heading where it is supposed to. While this system is most beneficial in snow or rain, it does come into play on dry pavement at times, too.\n\nAbout the size of a BMW 5-series or Lexus GS 300, the LS rides on a 114.5-inch wheelbase, has a fully independent suspension and comes with either a 3.0-liter, Duratec V6 or a 3.9-liter, dual-overhead-cam (DOHC) V8. The engines, different from those in the Jag, put out 210 and 252 horsepower respectively. The V6 is available with a 5-speed manual transmission for driving enthusiasts. The sport package of 17-inch wheels, harder brake pads, quicker steering and high-performance tires is standard with the V6 manual and optional ($1,000) on the other models.\n\nThe twisting two-lanes of the Napa Valley were ideal roads to show off the ride and handling. I spent a lot of time in a V6 equipped with the 5-speed Getrag transmission, a German unit also used by BMW. It doesn’t shift quite as sweetly as the BMW, but feels precise and direct. Lincoln expects only about 5 percent of buyers to pick this combination. Because of its near-perfect 50/50 front/rear weight distribution, the V6 5-speed feels well balanced in turns.\n\nThe 3.0-liter Duratec engin is the same one used in the Taurus, but now it is mounted longitudinally instead of transversely. Engineers say changing the mounting direction required considerable redesign work which resulted in more power and better drivability. Acceleration to 60 mph takes about 9 seconds.\n\nReal driving enthusiasts are likely to prefer this combination because the manual gearbox enables them to have better control for fast driving. This is the first Lincoln to be offered with a manual transmission since 1951.\n\nThe all-aluminum V8, related to the 4.0-liter V8 used in the Jaguar XK8, idles smoothly and accelerates authoritatively from all speeds. Its mid-range power makes it the best partner for the new 5-speed automatic transmission, which can also be specified with an optional SelectShift feature that allows the driver to shift the transmission manually.\n\nIn terms of daily drivability and satisfaction, the V8 is probably the engine of choice for most buyers, and Lincoln expects about 70 percent of sales to be this combination.\n\nFrom a comfort perspective, the interior of the LS is understated and simple, much like what one would expect of a German sedan. Heating, cooling and stereo are all grouped into a center console that is easy to reach and even easier to use because it has wide, flat buttons and knobs.\n\nAttention to detail is evident throughout:\n\nAchieving the near 50/50 weight distribution required mounting the battery in the trunk, and it is placed on the right side of the vehicle to partially offset the driver’s weight. The cooler trunk environment also improves battery life.\n\nThe driveshaft is a two-piece unit with a center bearing for enhanced smoothness. Each piece of the shaft is balanced to reduce vibration at high speeds.\n\nSeat cushions have linear stitching patterns for better looks and more comfort.\n\nDual-thickness, sound-deadening steel panels are used in strategic locations to reduce engine and road noise.\n\nHas Lincoln delivered on its promise to develop a world-class luxury touring sedan? Based on first impressions at the product launch, I would say yes. Understated styling, great road holding and energetic engines, all delivered at a reasonable price, add up to a successful formula.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the V6, 5-speed is $31,450.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nThere is no At A Glance box because this is a preview drive.

      "expert_review": "When it comes to selling cars, Lincoln is working both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhile pensioners and livery companies snap up Town Cars, Lincoln offers the LS for those still young enough to rock ‘n’ roll. That’s not a casual observation. According to Ford, the average Town Car buyer is 67 years old; LS buyers are in their early 50s.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive LS has been more successful in luring younger buyers than the car it replaced, the Taurus-based front-wheel-drive Continental, and it outsold the similarly-sized BMW 5-Series, Audi A6 and Cadillac CTS in 2002. But with fresh competition coming all the time, will the LS be able to hold its own? Hard to say.\n\nThe LS’s styling, while handsome, is conservative to a fault. Fortunately, new grille surround, fascia, exterior mirrors, rear deck lid, tail lamps, and wheels provide a more dignified look for 2003. More important are the overdue interior styling revisions that increase storage and improve the feel of luxury in the cabin.\n\nThe dash is functional and easy-to-use. There are thoughtful touches such as a center armrest that slides forward and an electronic tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Front bucket seats can be had with heat and air-conditioning, while rear seats can be ordered with heaters as well.\n\nOther options include real burl walnut and satin nickel trim, an upgraded audio system, and a DVD-based navigation system.\n\nStandard goodies include leather seats, heated windshield wipers, an electronic parking brake which frees up foot room by eliminating the third pedal and power-adjustable pedals, which allow for a perfect fit behind the wheel. That last item is a real advantage for shorter drivers, who must usually drive too close to the airbag-equipped steering wheel.\n\nThe back seats are average in comfort and fold to increase trunk space. The front seats are flat and hard. They proved so painful, one friend commented that it would be a stupendous automobile if it could be driven standing up.\n\nYet the car is stupendous to drive.\n\nThe LS comes with either a 232 horsepower 3.0-liter V-6 or a 280 horsepower 3.9-liter V-8.\n\nWhile the V-6 competes well with the Acura TL, Cadillac CTS, BMW 525 and 530 and Audi A6, the V-8 outguns the Acura and Cadillac, while matching the Audi and BMW at a lower base price. Both double-overhead-cam motors are equipped with variable valve timing and four valves per cylinder to ensure smooth, efficient running. The V-8 has been tuned for sound quality, according to Ford.\n\nThe only transmission is a 5-speed automatic that can be shifted sequentially like a manual. The manual transmission previously available on the V-6 is no longer available.\n\nPower is smooth and very strong, and the engine growls nicely. The added horsepower in the V-8-equipped test car not only provided for abundant power, it also was fairly economical for a V-8, returning 19 mpg.\n\nThe LS can be ordered with AdvanceTrac, Lincoln’s stability control system which includes traction control and anti-lock brakes.\n\nGrip is excellent, even in foul weather. Body lean is well controlled and the LS has all the sports sedan moves of its competitors. While not quite as buttoned-down as a 5-Series, it’s very close. It’s fun to drive, with quick sporty steering and a chassis that stays flat in corners.\n\nIf you’re considering this car, watch the price.\n\nThe test car Lincoln provided, the V-8 Premium Sport, had a $43,360 base price. That’s more than a six-cylinder Jaguar S-Type’s base price of $41,850. The Lincoln’s bottom line of $47,685 falls just shy of an 8-cylinder S-Type’s base price of $49,330. But traditionally, large discounts and incentives drastically reduce the transaction price of the Lincoln to more affordable levels.\n\nWhile not having the street credibility that the Cadillac CTS or BMW 5-Series enjoy, the LS is an American sports sedan that stands beside Europe’s best. Of course, this is no surprise since its basic components are shared with the Jaguar S-Type.\n\nAnd it’s the first Lincoln since the ’50s that has good power and handling without being as long or as tedious to maneuver as an aircraft carrier.",

      "expert_review": "Funny how “sure” things sometimes come up short.\n\nWhen it was first rolled out in 2000, the Lincoln LS was designed not only as a domestic alternative to the upscale sport sedans that come from Europe, it was meant to be a demographic lightning rod.\n\nSuddenly, it was supposed to be hip to be Lincoln again, or so automotive execs at Ford’s headquarters hoped. Lincoln saw the average age of its buyer creeping toward retirement; it needed some new blood.\n\nThe LS, with its sporty handling, unique styling and powerful engine, was slated to be the solution for every BMW lover who stole Lincoln’s sales. The LS was Motor Trend’s Car of the Year. It was the car for any thirtysomething.\n\nOr was it?\n\nIt took a few years for Lincoln dealerships to finally notice the clientele getting younger. But the LS never seemed to find its fountain of youth or its hip step. It seemed to be forever searching for that right mode – almost a wallflower on the automotive landscape.\n\nThe problem: It was a good car surrounded by excellence. BMW to the right. Mercedes to the left. And not much wiggle room in the middle. And the competition is cut-throat, especially with consumers who are some of the most discerning in the market.\n\nWhat to do? Keep trying again. After a few years of excessive tweaks, tugs and pulls, Lincoln hopes the 2004 LS finally makes a convincing argument. It has had enough surgery. Last year, the LS received a complete redesign. Horsepower was boosted in the 3.9-liter V-8 and the 3-liter V-6 (now 280 and 232, respectively). Interior improvements were meant to give the LS a more upscale ambience – real walnut trim found its way on the option list along with a high-grade sound system and an on-board navigation system.\n\nThis year, after numerous tweaks under the hood and inside the cockpit, Lincoln promises the package is getting better. We’ll somewhat agree.\n\nFor starters, for 2004 Lincoln hopes to increase the “wow” factor of its car again – this time offering a new LSE performance and appearance package, sharpening the ride by reducing noise, vibration and harshness, and simplifying the options. Buyers now have the choice of a V-6 in either Luxury or Premium or a V-8 in Sport or Ultimate models.\n\nThe best part of the LS? The entire package, especially for a reasonably priced (low $30,000) domestic trying-so-hard to be foreign. No matter how you slice it, the LS still has a good appearance, smart handling and an aggressive engine. The LS still is a handsome ride, complete with Lincoln’s signature grille up front, bold chrome, quad round headlamps and a sporty appearance.\n\nIt even adds interesting features, such as the LSE’s body-color grille, large air intake, seven-spoke chrome wheels and round fog lights.\n\nIt’s enough to get anyone motoring.\n\nOn the road, the LS is a mover, especially in the 3.9-liter DOHC 32-valve V-8. It bites into cor ners with the willingness of a Lexus and, with improved throttle control this year, power delivery is timed just right. Hard acceleration is not impossible. Steady cruising is always there.\n\nOne serious negative: A five-speed automatic is the only transmission offered. No manual – something that is sure to drop it off a few enthusiasts’ lists.\n\nBut for 2004, there can be no quivering over the greatest improvement: the interior. All models are smartly appointed and, even in V-6 form, come with standard or optional equipment you would expect when you have to compete with the big Europeans – things like a power moonroof, rain-sensing wipers, heated and cooled front seats covered in perforated leather, power-folding mirrors and an in-dash six-disc CD changer.\n\nInside, the look is classic. The center console is three times larger than previous models and splits the front compartment into driver and passenger. Gauges are accented with satin nickel trim, and there plenty of gadgets – from adjustable pedals to rear park assist – to keep you entertained. Other options on the LS include a DVD-based navigation system and a THX-certified, 10-speaker audio system. THX is the digital sound usually found at your local movie theater.\n\nStep up to the V-8 Sport and you’ll get most of the features of the Luxury V-6, but with 17-inch wheels and an automanual transmission that lets you shift without a clutch. The automanual replaces the standard five-speed automatic. Or there’s the option of going all-out with the V-8 Ultimate (formerly V-8 Premium Sport). The Ultimate adds HID headlamps and a sport-tuned suspension.\n\nBut to really compete with the Germans, you’ve got to have all the technology, so Lincoln made sure to stock the LS with other essentials – things like traction control, which is standard across the line.\n\nStability control is also standard on the V-8 Ultimate, and optional on all other trims, while the four-wheel antilock disc brakes are equipped with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and BrakeAssist. Both systems provide one element: control. In emergency situations, the systems engage and help the driver maintain control of the road and the ability to steer clear of a situation.\n\nBut the LS is not just about looks or interiors or gadgets. It’s about a package that offers something for everyone – with a twist.\n\nLincoln has always sold itself as a domestic alternative to European sports sedan luxury. With its buyers getting younger and its products getting broader, the LS hopes it has finally lived up to those expectations.\n\nWe’ll see.\n\n2004 Lincoln LS\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh gear: A smooth and comfort able sport sedan, the LS is a domes tic alternative in a tough field of foreign entries. The V8 is powerful and the interior classy.\n\nLow gear: A lack of a manual transmission is a serious turn-off, especially for enthusiasts. It’s not quite as nimble or athletic in the corners as some of the Germans.\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel drive, front-engine, four-door, five passenger sports sedan.\n\nKey competition: BMW 3-Series, Cadillac CTS, Audi A6, Lexus IS 300\n\nBase engine: 232 horsepower, 3.0-liter V6\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic\n\nStandard safety equipment: Front airbags; front side-impact airbags; stability control; ABS; brake assist; traction control.\n\nWheelbase: 114.5 inches\n\nLength: 193.9 inches\n\nMPG rating: 20 city/26 highway (3.0-liter)\n\nManufactured: USA\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $31,860 (V6 Luxury)\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $40,060",

      "expert_review": "The bad news thrown on top of Ford Motor Co.’s image in the past two years makes it easy to forget that the automaker actually does some things right.\n\nThere is, for example, the matter of the Lincoln LS sedan, which is a top domestic competitor for dollars spent in the entry-level luxury market, long dominated by European and Japanese automobiles.\n\nI drove a six-cylinder version of the Lincoln LS last year, its first year on sale, and was impressed. Recently I drove an eight-cylinder 2002 version of the car and was awed by its mostly smooth delivery of power and its exceptional grace in handling.\n\nDoes it beat the likes of a BMW 5-Series, its intended target, or a Mercedes-Benz C240 or C320 sedan? No. But it comes awfully close, and it could easily rank as an equal in that league if Lincoln’s designers were more willing to install interior wood accents instead of bits of polyurethane forestry and if they chose to use genuine all-leather seats instead of disconcerting (for a car in this class) leather seating surfaces backed by rather ordinary vinyl.\n\n“Entry-level luxury” cars are priced from about $28,000 to $40,000. The cars are mostly aspirational in market appeal. That means they are aimed at young, upwardly mobile buyers who want luxury brands and much of what those brands have to offer, at a price befitting their current income and employment levels.\n\nThe LS V-8 meets those desires in overall road performance, and with its short, sporty overhangs front and rear and BMW-like headlamps, it scores well in exterior appeal, too.\n\nCertainly, the LS V-8 represents good value per dollar — priced from $33,045 for a base V-6 model to $39,395 for the Premium LS V-8. Compare that with prices ranging from $35,950 for the BMW series with which it aims to compete.\n\nBut the problem for Lincoln goes far beyond the LS V-8’s underwhelming interior and the car’s occasional tendency to downshift during acceleration. The problem is systemic. BMW buyers tend to remain BMW buyers because they can move up the model ladder without losing anything in terms of performance or that very special BMW feel. The same is not true for Lincoln. It is doubtful, for instance, that a driver who has enjoyed the thrills of an LS V-6 or V-8 will find identical or more satisfaction in a lumbering Lincoln Town Car or Continental or in huge, overstuffed, cumbersome sport-utility models such as the Lincoln Blackwood (SUV/pickup) or Lincoln Navigator.\n\nThat means, as the Lincoln line is currently constituted, the LS buyer has nowhere else to go within the Lincoln family.\n\nBesides Lincoln, Ford’s offerings include Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo. Buyers interested in consistency are likely, for example, to start with a Jaguar X-Type, move to a Jaguar S-Type and roll into well-financed senior citizenry in a Jaguar XJ-Series or XK-Series.\n\nLincoln’s task, if it wants to remain in business, is to produce comparable upscale models. Given its success with the LS series, and given Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr.’s oft-stated desire to keep the Lincoln division, it is likely that Lincoln will meet that challenge, endure and ultimately thrive.\n\nI cannot say the same thing for the Mercury part of the Lincoln-Mercury division, which, with its rather paltry, copycat offerings of Ford models, has no legitimate place in the Premier Automotive group. On this one, Chairman Ford should make the tough decision to scrap Mercury and divert any savings from that unhappy event to the preservation and enhancement of Lincoln.",
