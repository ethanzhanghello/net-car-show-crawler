      "expert_review": "Perhaps more than any other old-school American auto brand, Lincoln needs revitalization the most.\n\nFor those in the baby boomer age range, just think about what the mention of a “Lincoln” car once meant to you. Elegance, class, luxury and excellence likely come to mind.\n\nAlas, in recent years, Lincoln to many minds has meant: Oh, you didn’t get the Lexus?\n\nThat’s sad, especially because Lincoln is trying. Take the new-for-2007 Lincoln MKZ, which I recently had in all-wheel-drive trim for a week of testing.\n\nThe MKZ upgrades the Lincoln Zephyr sedan, which was all new itself in 2006. Two new entry-level sedans in two years; that’s some serious effort.\n\nHaving tested the Zephyr last year, I can tell you that the MKZ is definitely a step up — but not a full step up, in my view.\n\nFirst off, the MKZ looks very cool, especially with the brighter-than-bright chrome, waterfall-style grille on the front end. It all but shrieks: “I am Lincoln. “\n\nThe tester wore Amethyst Clearcoat Metallic paint, which appeared to shine with thousands of amethyst stones in the bright sunlight.\n\nPassers-by stopped and commented on the spectacular color … not an everyday occurrence in this era of countless paint schemes.\n\nThose 17-inch, eight-spoke, machined-aluminum wheels certainly added some zip, too.\n\nThe impressive exterior look was more than upheld inside the tester.\n\nThe MKZ AWD starts at a comparatively affordable $31,050, but the tested model was gussied up with wood trim and leather. Even so, the interior cabin looked pricier than what one would expect from a car with a bottom-line sticker price of $35,445.\n\nEven the air vents had that classy, shiny-metal look, not the cheap plastic feel you sometimes get in cars priced above $30,000. Back-seat space is good, but not cavernous. Trunk space is excellent at 15.8 cubic feet.\n\nThe tester offered the THX II Certified audio system, billed as an industry first and an absolute blast with 14 speakers pouring out a surround-sound feast for the ears. The system can be had with Sirius Satellite Radio and an MP3 audio input jack.\n\nA navigation system, by the way, adds nearly $2,500 to the bottom line.\n\nOne of my problems with the 2006 Lincoln Zephyr was that the 3-liter V-6 with 221 horsepower was significantly lacking in oomph. Lincoln responded by putting a 3.5-liter V-6 with 263 horsepower in the MKZ.\n\nWhile performance has improved, I still feel that the MKZ needs a power boost. That’s particularly true on accelerations from a standing start, which are tepid and noisy.\n\nOnce it revs up, the MKZ is a smooth freeway cruiser. Steering is responsive, and the car holds its line well in slalom runs. At the top of steep inclines, however, I sensed more struggling and heard more noise.\n\nSurprisingly, Lincoln recommends good, old regular unleaded for the V-6 — a break for folks getting reaccustomed to the $50 fill-up this spring.\n\nFuel economy is a so-so 18 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on the open road.\n\nSo, has enough been done to the MKZ to make it a player in the entry-level luxury sedan segment? I think so.\n\nThere are a lot of $35,000, $40,000 and even $45,000 cars out there in midsize skin and stuffed full of customer-pleasing amenities. The MKZ stacks up very well in that group. I just wish it had a little more zing under the hood.\n\nQuick studies will note that what Lincoln is doing has already worked for another venerable American car brand. General Motors was successful in boosting Cadillac’s fortunes in recent years by introducing some flashy models that, surprise, bore initials instead of traditional car names.\n\nAbout those MKZ initials: Ford Motor Co. introduced the new Lincoln to be pronounced “Mark Z.” But folks immediately started calling it an “em-kay-zee.” Ford said: We’ll go with what the public wants. Good call … Certainly better than calling it a Zephyr, Version 2.0.\n\nPersonally, I’d call the MKZ a nice improvement over the recent past.\n\n2007 Lincoln MKZ at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2007 Lincoln MKZ AWD Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, all-wheel-drive, midsize luxury sedan Base price: $31,050 (as tested, $35,445 Engine: 3.5-liter V-6 with 263 horsepower at 6,250 revolutions per minute and 249 foot-pounds of torque at 4,500 rpm EPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city; 26 mpg highway (regular unleaded) Transmission: Six-speed automatic with overdrive Brakes: Power-assisted four-wheel discs with anti-lock and electronic brake force distribution Suspension: Independent short- and long-arm type on front; independent multi-link on rear (stabilizer bars front and rear) Fuel tank: 20 gallons Passenger volume: 99 cubic feet Trunk volume: 15.8 cubic feet Curb weight: 3,410 pounds Height: 57.2 inches Length: 190.5 inches Wheelbase: 107.4 inches Width: 72.2 inches Track: 61.6 inches on front; 61.3 inches on rear Ground clearance: 5.5 inches (estimated) Tires: P225/50VR17 radials Final assembly point: Hermosillo, Mexico",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Lincoln MKZ is a definite improvement, finally setting Lincoln apart from more mundane Fords, but flawed interior materials and unreliable electronics show more work is needed for this car to be truly competitive.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for not knowing much about the Lincoln brand as of late. Until the 2013 MKZ, there hasn’t been much to talk about. The last remaining brand in what used to be a pantheon of names owned by Ford Motor Company, it’s the sole survivor of the Great Recession under Ford ownership, aside from the namesake Ford brand itself. Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin and Volvo all found other owners and Mercury was shuttered, but Lincoln remains to carry on. Now, the hope is to revive a once-storied luxury brand to some semblance of its former popularity; this MKZ is the first vehicle in what is planned to be a new global product blitz.\n\nAll Lincolns of the past 20 years have shared their guts with less-fancy Ford models. Buyers have scoffed at Lincoln prices that got them content near or matching the high-end Fords on which they were based. But Ford says it’s gotten the message: Differentiate the Lincolns if you want people to think they’re special. This all-new MKZ is the first attempt to truly do that, and in many ways Ford has succeeded. It’s a completely new car, replacing the decidedly mediocre 2012 MKZ with a new platform, engines, interior and technology. But is it good enough to play with the established luxury brands and draw in new buyers?\n\nA New Look for Lincoln\nFrom the outside, the Lincoln MKZ’s look is striking. This is a complete departure from previous Lincolns, with sweeping lines and a near-fastback roof shape that evokes such beauties as the Audi A7. From the winged grille to the slim LED taillamps, this is a surprisingly attractive car — and in a change from the trend of the past two decades, it looks nothing like the Ford Fusion on which it’s based. My week with the MKZ garnered lots of admiring comments from passers-by, which is a good thing for Lincoln. The forgotten luxury brand needs to draw attention, and dramatic but tasteful, attractive styling is a good way to do it.\n\nAttention to detail in the design is evident. Look at the side mirrors: The shape of the mirror-mounting pillars alone is artwork. So is the glow from the taillight LEDs at night. The big wheels are perfectly proportioned to the arches, with a multispoke design and smoked finish that looks fantastic. Lincoln says it now has a dedicated design studio with more than 90 designers doing nothing but Lincoln work, and with the MKZ they’re off to a good start.\n\nBeneath the Skin\nThis latest Lincoln MKZ still shares its chassis with a more mundane Ford sedan, the Fusion. But given how good the latest Fusion is (it came in a close second in our recent family sedan competition), that’s not a bad thing. The MKZ features a choice of two powertrains. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine making 240 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque is standard, and the premium engine option is a 3.7-liter V-6 making 300 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both are available with front- or all-wheel-drive, and both employ a standard six-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid with a continuously variable automatic transmission is also available for no additional cost over the 2.0-liter turbo motor. The MKZ Hybrid uses a non-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, good for just 188 hp but considerably better fuel economy. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is covered separately in the Research section.\n\nMy test vehicle was a turbocharged 2.0-liter model with all-wheel drive. This is the top engine in the Fusion, and it’s a fantastic one. Torquey and never lacking for power, it’s responsive in just about any driving condition. From a stoplight or passing on the highway, it responds with a rush of power that’s very different from turbo engines of the past. It also provides a significant fuel-economy advantage over the larger V-6: The four-cylinder is EPA-rated at 22/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined, dropping to 22/31/25 mpg for the all-wheel-drive model. The V-6, by comparison, checks in at 19/28/22 mpg for the front-wheel-drive model; 18/26/21 mpg for a V-6 with all-wheel drive. The fuel-economy champ of the group is of course the hybrid, rated 45/45/45 mpg, though if the MKZ Hybrid follows the pattern of other Ford hybrids we’ve tried, your observed mileage may be considerably less. My time in the non-hybrid, which included a long drive from Michigan to Wisconsin and back via Chicago, returned a respectable 28 mpg overall.\n\nThe Lincoln MKZ is a very quiet car at speed. Highway travel is hushed, and the four-cylinder engine is never harsh, even in aggressive driving duty. Handling is acceptable — this is not a sport sedan in the BMW 3 Series or Infiniti Q50 vein — but it should adequately stack up against front-drive models like the Acura TL and Audi A4. Steering feel could be improved, however, as it skews toward the cushy end of the spectrum. Body roll is impressively controlled, with flat cornering that allows for more aggressive driving than we’ve seen in any Lincoln in years.\n\nButtons? We Don’t Need No Stinking Buttons\nThe interior is unfortunately where things begin to crumble. Visually, it’s beautiful — elegant and fresh, with clean forms and the same attention to detail that’s apparent in the exterior shapes and trim. High-quality materials abound; the gauge graphics are modern and attractive, and the seats are both comfortable and quite adjustable. Front seat room is good, but space is a bit more cramped in the rear due to a low, swoopy roofline that intrudes on headroom. At night, things light up with carefully designed highlights that look good and are even functional: Open a door and the adjustable-color accent lights on the interior door panel glow red to warn any vehicles approaching from behind. Switch everything off and the touch-sensitive center control panel goes blank — all the controls, buttons and lights disappear as if by magic.\n\nBut as good as everything looks, the fact that most controls in the Lincoln MKZ are flat-panel and touch sensitive creates problems: Not only does it require taking your eyes off the road to operate (every time), but it also provides zero tactile feedback. That feedback is essential to making you feel that you’ve bought a luxury vehicle, not an economy car. To operate most of the MKZ’s controls, you just plunk your fingers down or slide them along a solid plastic panel. A luxury car should feel luxurious, beyond things like leather seats, to help reinforce a buyer’s decision to spend a large amount of money on an automobile. There should be buttons with a certain quality when pushed and knobs that feel expensive when turned. The MKZ only has a handful of buttons and, ironically, they’re for something that almost every other car on the planet operates via a lever — the transmission. Arrayed on the left side of the upper console are the familiar PRNDL icons, but each appears on a selector button. Along with the park assist, hazard lights, window switches and controls on the steering wheel, these are the only buttons in the car. And those buttons don’t feel very high-quality, either; the turn-signal stalk and that weird transmission gear selector feel cheap. For comparison, flip the switches in any Audi or Mercedes-Benz and you’ll see exactly what I mean. The MKZ looks great inside, but it feels mediocre at best.\n\nThings aren’t helped by the latest version of MyLincoln Touch. Ford’s system for hands-free operation and voice controls doesn’t work any better in Lincoln font than it does in Ford script. During my week with the MKZ I experienced two navigation failures, one that placed me half a block away from my actual location and stayed that way for 5 miles, and another that decided to remotely update and reboot my system just 2 miles from my programmed destination in rush-hour traffic. I also experienced numerous failed attempts to control my iPod. If this system truly does learn the speech and words of its users, as Lincoln says it does, then by the end of my test the words it probably knew best are ones that can’t be printed here.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Lincoln MKZ received decent crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with an overall five-star safety rating. No data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is yet available. As with most modern cars, airbags abound. Dual-stage front airbags, side impact, side curtain and front knee airbags are standard, and something unique to Ford products is optional: inflatable airbags in the rear seat belts that reduce stress on passengers in a collision by spreading out the force of the belt over a larger, more cushioned area. See the MKZ’s safety specs (including anti-lock brakes and stability control) and a full equipment list here.\n\nMKZ in the Market\nAs with many new Ford products, the 2013 Lincoln MKZ does not come cheap. Base price for my 2.0T all-wheel-drive model was $38,710, including an $895 destination charge. A package added $3,150 worth of equipment, including navigation, a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera and a satellite radio package. Another package added active park assist, adaptive cruise control and a lane keeping / departure warning system for $2,250. The car’s attractive 19-inch alloy wheels were another $750, while the Smoke Quartz metallic paint was $495. The special inflatable rear seat belt airbag system added another $195, bringing the price as tested to $45,550. Load up an MKZ with a V-6, all-wheel-drive, a panoramic sunroof and all the technology goodies, and you’ll see the sticker climb to an eye-popping $51,000 and change. That kind of scratch could also buy you a very well-optioned twin-turbo V-6 Lincoln MKS, a considerably larger vehicle than the MKZ.\n\nPositioning the Lincoln MKZ against competitors is a little tricky, as Lincoln hasn’t been a viable luxury brand for some time; it’s been off the shopping lists of entry-level luxury buyers and is only now starting to get some attention. Seeing as how this is not a rear-drive sports luxury car, pitting it against body-type cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS or Lexus GS isn’t quite right. All those cars have a much more athletic bent to them, focused as much on driving pleasure as on opulent surroundings. The MKZ is more of a front-drive comfort luxury car, meaning it’s better pitted against the Lexus ES and Acura TL, or even the Buick LaCrosse. It matches most of them in price, as well, both in terms of base prices and when loaded. See how the MKZ stacks up against competitors here.\n\nWith its daring style and impressive powertrain options, the Lincoln MKZ should be a solid choice for entry-level luxury buyers, but a lack of luxury feel and flawed electronics may make potential buyers think twice.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2009 about the 2010 Lincoln MKZ. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe MKZ is Lincoln’s entry-level luxury sedan, but with its 2010 redesign there’s not much that’s entry-level about it. After driving the MKZ for a week, I’m impressed with its strong powertrain, premium interior and array of technology, but shoppers might want to think twice about the Sport Appearance Package, as its firm sport suspension seems out of place on this sedan.\n\nToothy Grille\nThe MKZ’s styling is starting to grow on me. The front end is distinctive. It gets a new tooth-like grille for 2010, which bears a closer resemblance to models like Lincoln’s MKS full-size sedan and MKT full-size crossover.\n\nAfter you get beyond the grille — which I didn’t really care for when I first saw the car at an auto show — the rest of the sedan is rather ordinary and looks a lot like its siblings, the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Sure, it has different taillights that sweep across the trunk lid, but otherwise it’s similar.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe optional Sport Appearance Package includes 18-inch aluminum wheels and a sport suspension, and the result is a notably firm ride — think all-wheel-drive Acura TL suspension tuning, not Lexus ES. Equipped this way, the MKZ faithfully tells you about all the rough patches in the road, whether you want to know about them or not. I suspect many buyers considering a Lincoln would prefer not to know about them — especially because there isn’t sports-car-like handling to go along with the taut ride quality. I haven’t driven an MKZ with the regular suspension and standard 17-inch wheels, but I suspect it offers better ride comfort.\n\nDespite the sportier setup, the MKZ cruises smoothly on the highway when the pavement is good. The interior is quiet, though you start to hear a little wind noise when approaching 80 mph.\n\nIt doesn’t take a lot of extra care to steer the MKZ — whether you’re traveling country roads or the highway. The main reason is that the steering has a solid, weighty feel when traveling in a straight path that makes it easy to keep the car between the lines. This heft also prevents you from inadvertently jostling the wheel.\n\nThe MKZ’s steering feel is different from what you’ll find in a Lexus ES, which has well-greased, light-effort steering that’s become synonymous with Toyota’s luxury brand. The MKZ doesn’t go that route, and I like it for that. Its steering is by no means too heavy, but the extra effort needed to turn the wheel makes you feel connected to the car in a way the Lexus can’t match. Overall, the MKZ’s steering feel and response are among its better characteristics.\n\nV-6 Power\nThe MKZ’s powertrain is another highlight. The 3.5-liter V-6 delivers strong acceleration; there’s plenty of power to get you up to speed quickly and effortlessly. The large-displacement V-6 also offers plenty of torque at low speeds. Acceleration is accompanied by a satisfying growl, but you can’t hear the engine at all when cruising on the highway.\n\nThe sedan’s six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, and kickdowns are easy to initiate by simply pressing harder on the gas pedal. The transmission now includes a clutchless-manual mode, which lets you control gear changes by nudging the console gear selector up and down. However, because the MKZ’s automatic is good at what it does, you probably won’t feel the need to override it.\n\nThe MKZ comes standard with front-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is available for an extra $1,890. It’ll also cost you more at the pump, as the all-wheel-drive model gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway, versus 18/27 mpg for the front-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nThe Inside\nI’m not a fan of all-gray interiors, which seem drab to me — even more so than all-black designs — but that’s what our MKZ had. Getting past my own preferences, however, let me appreciate a cabin with mostly good-quality materials and easy-to-use controls. However, low-grade plastic for the parking-brake handle, a roughly finished sunglasses holder and a sizable gap along the side of a storage-cubby door near the base of the center control panel stood out in the otherwise upscale cabin.\n\nMKZs come standard with leather-upholstered, heated-and-cooled front seats. The seats are supportive and offer a good driving position, but my own seat started to get a little sore when the drive stretched to a few hours. My back didn’t have any complaints, though.\n\nThe front of the cabin isn’t the most spacious, and this is mainly because of the MKZ’s low roofline, which limits headroom for taller occupants — especially with our test car’s optional moonroof, which characteristically steals a little more space. At 6-foot-1, I didn’t have much headroom to spare. Over-shoulder visibility when checking blind spots is good.\n\nThe rear bench seat is also finished in leather. It offers passable room for adults, but there’s not much extra space. Taller passengers sit with their knees elevated, so there’s not much thigh support.\n\nA 60/40-split folding backseat is standard, with releases in the trunk to fold the backrests. Unlike many sedans that offer folding backrests, the ones in the MKZ are spring-loaded, so when you pull the release handle they’re intended to automatically flop forward. That’s what happens with the smaller backrest section, but not the larger one — maybe it’s too heavy.\n\nThe downside is that it takes more effort to put the spring-loaded cushions back in place, as you have to fight that spring a little. In the end, you probably don’t need a spring at all.\n\nMKZ in the Market\nDespite the MKZ’s positive attributes, it’s going to have a tough go of it in the market. The competition is strong and getting stronger; besides the aforementioned TL and ES, the MKZ is up against a redesigned Buick LaCrosse and the impressive Infiniti G sedan. Also, luxury cars are statement cars. Lexus stands for refinement, and Acura for the latest technology. I’m not sure what statement the MKZ makes, and I question whether it can cut through the noise and connect with consumers. It will be unfortunate if it can’t, though; luxury-car shoppers will find a lot to like in the new MKZ if they take the time to give it a look.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2013 about the 2013 Lincoln MKZ. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Lincoln MKZ is a definite improvement, finally setting Lincoln apart from more mundane Fords, but flawed interior materials and unreliable electronics show more work is needed for this car to be truly competitive.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for not knowing much about the Lincoln brand as of late. Until the 2013 MKZ, there hasn’t been much to talk about. The last remaining brand in what used to be a pantheon of names owned by Ford Motor Company, it’s the sole survivor of the Great Recession under Ford ownership, aside from the namesake Ford brand itself. Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin and Volvo all found other owners and Mercury was shuttered, but Lincoln remains to carry on. Now, the hope is to revive a once-storied luxury brand to some semblance of its former popularity; this MKZ is the first vehicle in what is planned to be a new global product blitz.\n\nAll Lincolns of the past 20 years have shared their guts with less-fancy Ford models. Buyers have scoffed at Lincoln prices that got them content near or matching the high-end Fords on which they were based. But Ford says it’s gotten the message: Differentiate the Lincolns if you want people to think they’re special. This all-new MKZ is the first attempt to truly do that, and in many ways Ford has succeeded. It’s a completely new car, replacing the decidedly mediocre 2012 MKZ with a new platform, engines, interior and technology. But is it good enough to play with the established luxury brands and draw in new buyers?\n\nA New Look for Lincoln\nFrom the outside, the Lincoln MKZ’s look is striking. This is a complete departure from previous Lincolns, with sweeping lines and a near-fastback roof shape that evokes such beauties as the Audi A7. From the winged grille to the slim LED taillamps, this is a surprisingly attractive car — and in a change from the trend of the past two decades, it looks nothing like the Ford Fusion on which it’s based. My week with the MKZ garnered lots of admiring comments from passers-by, which is a good thing for Lincoln. The forgotten luxury brand needs to draw attention, and dramatic but tasteful, attractive styling is a good way to do it.\n\nAttention to detail in the design is evident. Look at the side mirrors: The shape of the mirror-mounting pillars alone is artwork. So is the glow from the taillight LEDs at night. The big wheels are perfectly proportioned to the arches, with a multispoke design and smoked finish that looks fantastic. Lincoln says it now has a dedicated design studio with more than 90 designers doing nothing but Lincoln work, and with the MKZ they’re off to a good start.\n\nBeneath the Skin\nThis latest MKZ still shares its chassis with a more mundane Ford sedan, the Fusion. But given how good the latest Fusion is (it came in a close second in our recent family sedan competition; click here for more info), that’s not a bad thing. The MKZ features a choice of two powertrains. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine making 240 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque is standard, and the premium engine option is a 3.7-liter V-6 making 300 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque. Both are available with front- or all-wheel-drive, and both employ a standard six-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid with a continuously variable automatic transmission is also available for no additional cost over the 2.0-liter turbo motor. The MKZ Hybrid uses a non-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, good for just 188 hp but considerably better fuel economy. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is covered separately in the Research section.\n\nMy test vehicle was a turbocharged 2.0-liter model with all-wheel drive. This is the top engine in the Fusion, and it’s a fantastic one. Torquey and never lacking for power, it’s responsive in just about any driving condition. From a stoplight or passing on the highway, it responds with a rush of power that’s very different from turbo engines of the past. It also provides a significant fuel-economy advantage over the larger V-6: The four-cylinder is EPA-rated at 22/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined, dropping to 22/31/25 mpg for the all-wheel-drive model. The V-6, by comparison, checks in at 19/28/22 mpg for the front-wheel-drive model; 18/26/21 mpg for a V-6 with all-wheel drive. The fuel-economy champ of the group is of course the hybrid, rated 45/45/45 mpg, though if the MKZ Hybrid follows the pattern of other Ford hybrids we’ve tried, your observed mileage may be considerably less. My time in the non-hybrid, which included a long drive from Michigan to Wisconsin and back via Chicago, returned a respectable 28 mpg overall.\n\nThe MKZ is a very quiet car at speed. Highway travel is hushed, and the four-cylinder engine is never harsh, even in aggressive driving duty. Handling is acceptable — this is not a sport sedan in the BMW 3 Series or Infiniti Q50 vein — but it should adequately stack up against front-drive models like the Acura TL and Audi A4. Steering feel could be improved, however, as it skews toward the cushy end of the spectrum. Body roll is impressively controlled, with flat cornering that allows for more aggressive driving than we’ve seen in any Lincoln in years.\n\nButtons? We Don’t Need No Stinking Buttons\nThe interior is unfortunately where things begin to crumble. Visually, it’s beautiful — elegant and fresh, with clean forms and the same attention to detail that’s apparent in the exterior shapes and trim. High-quality materials abound; the gauge graphics are modern and attractive, and the seats are both comfortable and quite adjustable. Front seat room is good, but space is a bit more cramped in the rear due to a low, swoopy roofline that intrudes on headroom. At night, things light up with carefully designed highlights that look good and are even functional: Open a door and the adjustable-color accent lights on the interior door panel glow red to warn any vehicles approaching from behind. Switch everything off and the touch-sensitive center control panel goes blank — all the controls, buttons and lights disappear as if by magic.\n\nBut as good as everything looks, the fact that most controls in the MKZ are flat-panel and touch sensitive creates problems: Not only does it require taking your eyes off the road to operate (every time), but it also provides zero tactile feedback. That feedback is essential to making you feel that you’ve bought a luxury vehicle, not an economy car. To operate most of the MKZ’s controls, you just plunk your fingers down or slide them along a solid plastic panel. A luxury car should feel luxurious, to help reinforce a buyer’s decision to spend a large amount of money on an automobile. There should be buttons with a certain quality when pushed and knobs that feel expensive when turned. The MKZ only has a handful of buttons and, ironically, they’re for something that almost every other car on the planet operates via a lever — the transmission. Arrayed on the left side of the upper console are the familiar PRNDL icons, but each appears on a selector button. Along with the park assist, hazard lights, window switches and controls on the steering wheel, these are the only buttons in the car. And those buttons don’t feel very high-quality, either; the turn-signal stalk and that weird transmission gear selector feel cheap. For comparison, flip the switches in any Audi or Mercedes-Benz and you’ll see exactly what I mean. The MKZ looks great inside, but it feels mediocre at best.\n\nThings aren’t helped by the latest version of MyLincoln Touch. Ford’s system for hands-free operation and voice controls doesn’t work any better in Lincoln font than it does in Ford script. During my week with the MKZ I experienced two navigation failures, one that placed me half a block away from my actual location and stayed that way for 5 miles, and another that decided to remotely update and reboot my system just 2 miles from my programmed destination in rush-hour traffic. I also experienced numerous failed attempts to control my iPod. If this system truly does learn the speech and words of its users, as Lincoln says it does, then by the end of my test the words it probably knew best are ones that can’t be printed here.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 MKZ received decent crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with an overall five-star safety rating. No data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is yet available. As with most modern cars, airbags abound. Dual-stage front airbags, side impact, side curtain and front knee airbags are standard, and something unique to Ford products is optional: inflatable airbags in the rear seat belts that reduce stress on passengers in a collision by spreading out the force of the belt over a larger, more cushioned area. See the MKZ’s safety specs here and a full equipment list here.\n\nMKZ in the Market\nAs with many new Ford products, the 2013 Lincoln MKZ does not come cheap. Base price for my 2.0T all-wheel-drive model was $38,710, including an $895 destination charge. A package added $3,150 worth of equipment, including navigation, a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera and a satellite radio package. Another package added active park assist, adaptive cruise control and a lane departure warning system for $2,250. The car’s attractive 19-inch alloy wheels were another $750, while the Smoke Quartz metallic paint was $495. The special inflatable rear seat belt airbag system added another $195, bringing the price as tested to $45,550. Load up an MKZ with a V-6, all-wheel-drive, a panoramic sunroof and all the technology goodies, and you’ll see the sticker climb to an eye-popping $51,000 and change. That kind of scratch could also buy you a very well-optioned twin-turbo V-6 Lincoln MKS, a considerably larger vehicle than the MKZ. See pricing for the MKZ here.\n\nPositioning the MKZ against competitors is a little tricky, as Lincoln hasn’t been a viable luxury brand for some time; it’s been off the shopping lists of entry-level luxury buyers and is only now starting to get some attention. Seeing as how this is not a rear-drive sports luxury car, pitting it against cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS or Lexus GS isn’t quite right. All those cars have a much more athletic bent to them, focused as much on driving pleasure as on opulent surroundings. The MKZ is more of a front-drive comfort luxury car, meaning it’s better pitted against the Lexus ES and Acura TL, or even the Buick LaCrosse. It matches most of them in price, as well, both in terms of base prices and when loaded. See how the MKZ stacks up against competitors here.\n\nWith its daring style and impressive powertrain options, the MKZ should be a solid choice for entry-level luxury buyers, but a lack of luxury feel and flawed electronics may make potential buyers think twice.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The midsize MKZ, Lincoln’s entry-level sedan continues for 2008 with just a few changes after receiving some major revisions last year that included a new name, a new engine, an all-wheel-drive option, and some face-lifting.\n\nNew for 2008 is the addition of Ford’s Sync audio system as standard equipment, along with a reverse-sensing system, Sirius satellite radio, and premium leather heated and cooled seats. The car also gets a tire-pressure monitoring system.\n\nSync is a voice-activated in-car communications and entertainment system developed jointly by Ford and Microsoft. It allows for operation of mobile phones and portable MP3 music players, such as iPod, with simple voice commands.\n\nThere are four new exterior colors offered for 2008, as well. They are Dark Blue Ink Clearcoat Metallic, Moss Green Clearcoat Metallic, Vapor Silver Clearcoat Metallic and White Suede Clearcoat.\n\nThe midsize car that debuted for 2006 as the Zephyr was renamed the MKZ for 2007, and instead of the 221-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine in the 2006 model, the newest version comes with a much better 3.5-liter V-6, rated at 263 horsepower.\n\nChanges this drastic on a vehicle after only a year on the market are quite rare, but Ford Motor Co. officials felt that it was important to do something to differentiate the Zephyr more from its siblings, the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan.\n\nWhen all three of these sedans were introduced two years ago, they were quite similar, including the 3.0-liter engine.\n\nBut Lincoln buyers expected more from the Zephyr – especially under the hood – than Ford and Mercury buyers were getting in their Fusions and Milans, which cost several thousand dollars less.\n\nTo justify the nearly $30,000 starting price of the Zephyr vs. the $21,000 beginning price for the V-6 version of the Fusion and $22,000 for the Milan, Ford did dress up the Zephyr a bit.\n\nStandard amenities included leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control and eight-spoke aluminum wheels.\n\nBut some at Ford’s Lincoln Mercury division felt that the Zephyr was too close in design and content to the Fusion and especially the Milan, particularly since both the Zephyr and Milan are sold in the same showrooms.\n\nThat explains some of the upgrades, and especially the new, more-powerful engine.\n\nAs for the name change, Ford says that was part of a new naming strategy for Lincoln products intended to make them sound more like luxury models. The company introduced a new midsize Lincoln crossover sport utility vehicle for 2007 called the MKX, which replaced the Ford Explorer-based Lincoln Aviator, and this year will roll out a replacement for the discontinued LS sedan, called the MKS.\n\nFord decided not to change the name of the Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility, which, besides being redesigned for 2007, now also comes in a new extended-length version intended to compete against the Chevrolet Suburban-length Cadillac Escalade ESV.\n\nThe Navigator has been in the lineup for several years, so its name has had time to build some value for Ford.\n\nThe Zephyr name, although revived from Lincoln’s past, had little recognition among today’s consumers.\n\nEven with the bigger engine and other improvements, the MKZ’s starting price is still around $30,000 for the front-wheel-drive model.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive version starts about $2,000 higher. It was the first all-wheel-drive car for the Lincoln brand, but a necessary move to help the car compete against other sport sedans in this class that offer all-wheel drive, including the Infiniti G35 and Lexus IS.\n\nThe car’s revised power is similar to that of some of its competitors, such as the base Cadillac CTS, Lexus ES 350 and Acura TL.\n\nFord has high hopes for the MKZ, which is intended to help bring new, younger customers into the Lincoln brand. Almost half of the buyers of the Zephyr were new to the Lincoln brand, the company said.\n\nThe previous model won several honors, including Ward’s Auto World magazine’s 2006 “Best Premium-Car Interior” award, and came in second in its segment in the 2006 J.D. Power Initial Quality Study.\n\nAs for the exterior changes for the MKZ, it comes with Lincoln’s traditional waterfall grille, and also features “clean lines, new 17-inch machined aluminum wheels, distinctive lighting and chrome accents” that “create a dynamic, uniquely American interpretation of luxury,” the automaker said.\n\nIt’s not quite as distinctive as some of its European competitors, but not nearly as bland as some of the Japanese entries in the crowded entry-luxury segment.\n\nThis car really does look great, and there’s nothing cheap about it, inside or out.\n\nThe engine is all-aluminum, has four valves per cylinder, and has variable valve timing, similar to some of the best new engines from Japan. This engine will be used in other Ford vehicles as well, to the point that one in five will eventually come with the engine, the company said.\n\nIn the MKZ, it’s connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, which carried over from the Zephyr.\n\nTo handle the extra power, the car’s suspension was been retuned; the changes were designed to “deliver a more athletic driving experience,” the company said.\n\nThe all-wheel drive is designed for all-weather driving, and requires no driver input – it operates fully automatically to send power to any of the four wheels as needed. This is not a feature that is useful only in snowy climates, however; even consumers in Texas will enjoy the sure-footed traction on wet or dry pavement.\n\nOnly two models are offered – front or all-wheel drive; there are no other trim levels.\n\nStandard features of the MKZ include a wood- and leather-trimmed interior; 17-inch, painted-aluminum, eight-spoke wheels; LED taillights; dual-zone automatic climate control; heated, 10-way power-adjustable driver and front passenger seats with power lumbar and recline; memory feature for the driver’s seat and mirrors; and a new auxiliary input jack for the audio system that allows for easy connection of an iPod or other MP3 player.\n\nBesides all-wheel drive, options include Sirius satellite radio; an uplevel THX audio system with 14 speakers and a six-disc, in-dash CD player compatible with MP3 and text-format CDs; a GPS navigation system with a 6.5-inch screen and the ability to give audible directions in English, Spanish or French; high-intensity-discharge headlights; 17-inch, eight-spoke chrome wheels; premium perforated-leather cooled front seats; a power moon roof; and satin-nickel interior trim instead of wood on the doors, center console and instrument panel.\n\nThis car really does look great, and there’s nothing cheap about it, inside or out.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRelated to the Ford Fusion and Ford Fusion Hybrid, the five-seat MKZ and MKZ Hybrid compete with entry-level luxury cars like the Acura TL and Lexus ES 350. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional.\n\n(Skip to details on the: MKZ Hybrid)\n\nNew for 2012\nNewly available Sync AppLink provides voice control of select smartphone applications. \n\nExterior\nExterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nSport Appearance Package includes 18-inch wheels, unique grille and darker headlights\nAcoustic laminated windshield for noise reduction\n\nInterior\nLike the bigger MKS, the MKZ comes with genuine wood trim and upscale leather. The optional navigation system features Sirius Travel Link, which can track, among other things, nearby movie listings, weather forecasts and gas stations with regularly updated fuel prices. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard heated and cooled front seats with 10-way power adjustments\nStandard Sync communication system\nOptional moonroof\nMyKey programmable system that limits speed\nAmbient interior lighting with five color schemes\nOptional THX-certified surround-sound stereo with 14 speakers\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 263-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 teams with a six-speed automatic transmission and standard front-wheel drive. Lincoln says the zero-to-60-mph acceleration time is 7.1 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional all-wheel drive\nOptional Sport Appearance Package includes sport-tuned suspension\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. The MKZ’s six standard airbags include side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Other safety features include:\n\n\nSOS Post-Crash Alert flashes lights and sounds horn\nOptional blind spot warning system\nOptional backup camera\n\nMKZ Hybrid\nLincoln’s first hybrid is also the first midsize, front-wheel-drive hybrid sedan from a luxury automaker. The MKZ Hybrid’s drivetrain technology should look familiar, as the car is related to the Ford Fusion Hybrid, but a number of luxury touches are added. It gets an EPA-estimated 41/36 mpg city/highway.\n\nLike the Fusion Hybrid, the MKZ Hybrid doesn’t do much to advertise itself as a hybrid. Hybrid badges appear on the front doors and trunk lid, but without them, this sedan could easily be mistaken for a regular MKZ, with its large twin-port grille and wide LED taillights.\n\nThe MKZ Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and an electric motor that make a combined 191 hp. As with the Fusion Hybrid, Ford says the MKZ Hybrid can travel up to 47 mph on electric power alone.\n\nPerhaps more significant than the maximum electric-only cruising speed is the MKZ Hybrid’s SmartGauge with EcoGuide technology, which can help the driver drive more efficiently. Whereas the instrument panel on the Fusion Hybrid uses green vines that “grow” larger the more efficiently you drive, the MKZ Hybrid adds to that with white flowers that “blossom” with long-term efficient driving.\n\nStandard luxury features include Bridge of Weir leather upholstery, heated and cooled front seats, a memory feature for the driver’s seat and real wood trim.

      "expert_review": "I’ve always liked the Lincoln MKZ best of the three Ford Motor Co. midsize sedan triplets. I’m not a parent, so I can like one child more than the others. The Mercury Milan’s spokeswoman challenged for the top spot, but the Lincoln just had a few more charms, and, of course, it was an actual car.\n\nIt may have undergone an identity crisis when it arrived at dealerships a few years ago as the Lincoln Zephyr for one year before changing its name to MKZ. (To this day, I’m not sure if it’s called the M-K-Z or the Mark Z — it all depends who you talk to at Ford.)\n\nBut even then, it had things the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan lacked. It came with the beefy 3.5-liter V-6 while its siblings used a 3-liter V-6 for maximum power. It had the heated and cooled seats and the fabulous THX Certified stereo that could jam tunes so loud your ears would ring an hour after parking it.\n\nFor 2009, Lincoln has added a few more features to this entry level luxury sedan. There’s a Midnight Black special edition that includes satin nickel accents and light-colored maple trim as well as black perforated leather seats with white piping.\n\nThere are also the features I like in the MKZ, including Sync, the top notch voice-activated phone and music player. And that 14 speaker, 600-watt optional stereo that does more to sound waves than Adrian Belew with a rubber guitar.\n\nBut when I hopped inside the 2009 MKZ for a quick drive, I was surprised. This sedan has not aged as well as the others. It was like running into an old acquaintance and wondering, “What happened while you were away?”\n\nThe MKZ hasn’t held up as well as I had hoped. It may still have that sharp exterior, big waterfall grille and funky taillights, but inside, the competition, including the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Cadillac CTS, runs laps around it. Thirty-four thousand dollars is a lot of money to put down for this Lincoln, when $30K will buy you more car from a lot of carmakers — both foreign and domestic.\n\nJust compare the center stack of those four vehicles and you’ll see a big difference. All of the competitors have sleek and clean techno-friendly looking displays. The MKZ’s center stack looks like a tribute to the robot on “Lost in Space.” Danger Will Robinson, Danger! The dash should reflect all of the technology instead of detract from it.\n\nDriving the MKZ, however, is still a pleasure. The car keeps a sporty ride to fit its powerful engine — 263-horsespower and 249-pound-feet torque. The six-speed automatic transmission glides through the gears and finds the right gear quickly — no hunting or pecking for this tranny.\n\nEven the power rack-and-pinion steering is clean and well-weighted. Lincoln has come a long way from those floaty cars of years ago. The MKZ can cut corners with any midsize sedan.\n\nAfter every mile, I found myself a little more confident behind the wheel. The pickup was sharp and crisp. It may not throw you back in the seat, but it does hold you there quite nicely.\n\nBody roll and sway was minimal on long sweeping turns or sharp right angled ones. Along those beautiful roads near Brighton, I carved them up.\n\nThe cabin was remarkably quiet, which Lincoln has correctly equated with quality. If people don’t hear the outside world, their assumption is the car is well made. This Lincoln is, despite the ugly center stack.\n\nThe heated seats were handy on the crisp day I took it for a drive, and when I tried the cooled seats, they worked well, though it felt uncomfortable after a few minutes.\n\nAdmittedly, though, all cooled or ventilated seats make me uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I finally parked the MKZ, I had to rethink if this was still my favorite out of three Ford midsized cars.\n\nIt has the power, abilities and technology inside to hang with the bigger boys in that $30,000 category. But its interior packaging doesn’t match the competition.\n\nMaybe, I’ll take a second look at the Milan — I’ve always thought spokeswoman Jill Wagner was aging very well.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "If you spend any amount of time trying to appear younger or seeking affirmation that you couldn’t possibly look your age, the 2010 Lincoln MKZ isn’t for you. The MKZ is a classy, luxurious and comfortable sedan, but it tends to be more interested in routing you to the local diner or golf course rather than the elementary school, park, or any shops or restaurants that would be considered trendy. I felt like I was driving my grandpa’s car the whole week of my test drive.\n\nThe MKZ has a starting MSRP of $34,225; my front-wheel-drive test car cost $40,560.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, the MKZ has plenty of power stowed away for the odd chance you might need to rush somewhere. Its ride is super smooth without so much as a jolt. It’s a graceful car that would choose a Sunday drive over a rush-hour haul.\n\nTo be fair, the MKZ does have all the elements necessary for making a great family car. The kids were able to get in and out easily, and the cargo area was huge. There’s no wrestling to get the stroller in the trunk of this ride.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Lincoln MKZ has status. Redesigned for 2010, it’s well-suited for the country club set. My kids thought it was fancy, which made them feel special and made me feel like a chauffeur. The tall, shimmering grille reminded me of a butterfly, with its two wings separated by the Lincoln emblem.\n\nThe MKZ has lots of power with its 263-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that runs on regular gas. It gets an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway.\n\nThis sedan is so family-friendly that my kids became almost completely independent in it. With doors they could open and close on their own and a backseat they could easily step into, they were getting settled without any help from me. Although I’m sure it was meant to hold golf bags, the trunk easily swallowed a week’s worth of groceries. The bags were well within even my 4-year-old’s reach — at least the bags closest to the opening. This allowed both boys to help Mommy unload the trunk.\n\nMy only real displeasure with the MKZ’s exterior is the rear window is far too small for adequate visibility. The large head restraints for the second row also didn’t help matters.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 2010 MKZ’s redesign included many changes to the interior, which is clean-looking and clutter-free. I liked the delicate swooshes of real wood accenting the interior doors and the no-nonsense approach to the center stack and related controls. My test car had the Sync system as well as dual-zone climate control.\n\nThe leather seats are comfy, and in the first row, they’re power-adjustable and heated. My 6-foot husband and I had plenty of legroom in the front, and my kids had lots of it in the backseat, as well. The boys also liked that the backseat’s cupholders were easy to reach in the armrest.\n\nOut of curiosity, I hopped into the second row to get a feel for the center seat. It wasn’t great because of the hump in the floor, which pushed my feet and legs into an uncomfortable position. When I tried buckling up with a boy in a booster seat on either side of me, there were wars over buckle receptors. I’m not proud.\n\nI was really surprised by the sound system in this five-seater. My test car had the optional THX II audio system. It truly has theater-like sound, which was an enjoyable surprise for a car we thought was for older people. It pounded out our Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga just fine.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThere’s no hunting or digging for Latch connectors in the MKZ. They stuck out from the cushions, so there wasn’t any thumb-wrestling with overstuffed cushions to get everyone’s child-safety seats installed. With all of the legroom in the second row, a rear-facing convertible or infant-safety seat should fit in the backseat without any problems.\n\nThe MKZ has standard front-wheel drive, but as a Michiganian, I’d opt for the all-wheel-drive model. It also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control, an electronic stability system and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nThe MKZ has several blind spots, and I depended a lot on the MKZ’s available blind spot warning system and standard rear parking sensors. It also has an available backup camera.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Lincoln MKZ here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nThe Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size entry-luxury sedan that seats five. Power comes from a 245-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 350 or 400 hp. Both engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the MKZ offers front- or all-wheel drive. A front-wheel-drive gas-electric MKZ Hybrid is also offered. Competitors include the Acura TLX, Lexus ES and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nNew standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high-beam headlights. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also now standard, and the MKZ Hybrid gets standard adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lincoln MKZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include an adaptive suspension, 18-inch aluminum wheels, rear parking sensors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, remote start, a push-button gear selector, a touchscreen multimedia system, heated front seats and a split-folding backseat. Available features include a power-adjustable steering column, a power trunk lid, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a choice of two Revel premium stereos, leather-trimmed seats, heated rear seats and inflatable rear seat belts.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nThe extra standard safety features are a welcome addition, and the MKZ has easy-to-use tech features, too. We like how the fuel-efficient MKZ Hybrid has the same starting price as the regular MKZ. There are some questionable design choices, however, like the car’s push-button gear selector.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLincoln used the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show to take the wraps off the new version of its midsize luxury sedan, the MKZ. Gone is the split grille with swooping headlights that dominated past Lincoln models in favor of a more conventional look.\n\nLincoln says it designed the MKZ to appeal to buyers who wanted something different in the segment and says it embodies the idea of “quiet luxury.”\nExterior\nThe MKZ looks more conventional, if not downright conservative, with the new grille design. There are also subtle peaks that run the length of the hood and LED accents around and below the headlights.\n\nThere are 19-inch wheels available on some versions of the MKZ, as well as a fully retractable panoramic moonroof that, Lincoln says, will offer the largest open-air roof among sedans on the market.\nInterior\nInside, some features such as the floating center console and push-button gear selection remain in the new model, but Lincoln said it reworked the controls so that there are now switches and dials for commonly used ventilation and audio functions. These replace slider adjustments in the 2016 model and are a welcome change.\n\nIn addition, for 2017, there are two new Lincoln Black Label themes – Chalet and Vineyard – that are offered along with the Thoroughbred theme for 2017. Finally, the Lincoln Active Noise Control system carries over for 2017.\nUnder the Hood\nThere’s a new engine that’s exclusive to the MKZ for 2017. It’s a 3.0-liter V-6 that, when matched up with optional all-wheel drive, produces 400 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque. (The engine is limited to 350 horsepower if one chooses front-wheel drive, but torque numbers are unaffected.)\n\nA hybrid version uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and is front-wheel drive. Details, including mileage, have not yet been announced.\n\nThe Driver’s Package, available with the 3.0-liter V-6, includes 19-inch wheels and ebony-painted brake calipers.\nSafety\nThere are a number of safety options including precollision assist, which is designed to detect pedestrians and help avoid or lesson the severity of some frontal collisions. In addition, there’s optional adaptive cruise control and parking assist to help steer the MKZ into parking spaces.",
