      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRelated to the Ford Fusion and Ford Fusion Hybrid, the five-seat MKZ and MKZ Hybrid compete with entry-level luxury cars like the Acura TL and Lexus ES 350. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional.\n\n(Skip to details on the: MKZ Hybrid)\n\nNew for 2012\nNewly available Sync AppLink provides voice control of select smartphone applications. \n\nExterior\nExterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nSport Appearance Package includes 18-inch wheels, unique grille and darker headlights\nAcoustic laminated windshield for noise reduction\n\nInterior\nLike the bigger MKS, the MKZ comes with genuine wood trim and upscale leather. The optional navigation system features Sirius Travel Link, which can track, among other things, nearby movie listings, weather forecasts and gas stations with regularly updated fuel prices. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard heated and cooled front seats with 10-way power adjustments\nStandard Sync communication system\nOptional moonroof\nMyKey programmable system that limits speed\nAmbient interior lighting with five color schemes\nOptional THX-certified surround-sound stereo with 14 speakers\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 263-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 teams with a six-speed automatic transmission and standard front-wheel drive. Lincoln says the zero-to-60-mph acceleration time is 7.1 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nOptional all-wheel drive\nOptional Sport Appearance Package includes sport-tuned suspension\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. The MKZ’s six standard airbags include side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Other safety features include:\n\n\nSOS Post-Crash Alert flashes lights and sounds horn\nOptional blind spot warning system\nOptional backup camera\n\nMKZ Hybrid\nLincoln’s first hybrid is also the first midsize, front-wheel-drive hybrid sedan from a luxury automaker. The MKZ Hybrid’s drivetrain technology should look familiar, as the car is related to the Ford Fusion Hybrid, but a number of luxury touches are added. It gets an EPA-estimated 41/36 mpg city/highway.\n\nLike the Fusion Hybrid, the MKZ Hybrid doesn’t do much to advertise itself as a hybrid. Hybrid badges appear on the front doors and trunk lid, but without them, this sedan could easily be mistaken for a regular MKZ, with its large twin-port grille and wide LED taillights.\n\nThe MKZ Hybrid is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and an electric motor that make a combined 191 hp. As with the Fusion Hybrid, Ford says the MKZ Hybrid can travel up to 47 mph on electric power alone.\n\nPerhaps more significant than the maximum electric-only cruising speed is the MKZ Hybrid’s SmartGauge with EcoGuide technology, which can help the driver drive more efficiently. Whereas the instrument panel on the Fusion Hybrid uses green vines that “grow” larger the more efficiently you drive, the MKZ Hybrid adds to that with white flowers that “blossom” with long-term efficient driving.\n\nStandard luxury features include Bridge of Weir leather upholstery, heated and cooled front seats, a memory feature for the driver’s seat and real wood trim.

Options include a power-adjustable steering column, a power trunk lid, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a choice of two Revel stereos, leather seating surfaces and heated rear seats.   \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nThe MKZ has some fine attributes, including a comfortable driving experience and a number of standard active safety features. We also like the availability of an efficient hybrid model. There are some questionable design choices, however, like the car’s push-button gear selector.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2013 Lincoln MKZ is the brand’s first model using a new strategy to inject more luxury into its products. As a result, the MKZ has unique features and styling that make it a significant departure from the previous model. The MKZ faces competition from the Acura TL, Infiniti G Series and BMW 3 Series.\n\n(Skip to details on MKZ Hybrid)\n\nExterior\nThe MKZ’s front is restyled with a “split-wing grille,” as Lincoln calls it, designed to emulate an eagle’s spread wings. The rear styling is a much more drastic departure from current Lincoln products with its sweeping rear roofline and laid-back windshield to help the MKZ slip through the air. Exterior features include:\n\nLED headlamps\nAdaptive headlights\nLED taillights\nAvailable retracting panoramic roof\n\nInterior\nInside the 2013 MKZ are numerous display screens to make use of the standard MyLincoln Touch and Sync multimedia systems. A 10.1-inch LCD instrument cluster in front of the driver is customizable, and an 8-inch screen in the center dashboard is the main control area for the multimedia, navigation and climate systems. Selecting gears happens by pushing a button on the MKZ’s center stack, which frees up room below the center console for a large storage area with multiple levels. Interior features include:\n\nSync and MyLincoln Touch\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable navigation\nAvailable cooled front seats\nAvailable heated rear seats and steering wheel\nAvailable adaptive cruise control\nAvailable parking assist\n\nUnder the Hood\nOne of the only ways to tell that the MKZ shares its underpinnings with the 2013 Ford Fusion is the powertrain options. The base engine is a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine, while an optional V-6 is more potent than the previous MKZ. The MKZ offers Lincoln Drive Control standard, which tailors the driving experience for different modes, including Sport, Normal and Comfort. The feature changes suspension firmness, power-steering assist, plus engine and transmission characteristics. Mechanical features include:\n\nStandard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is estimated to make 240 horsepower\nOptional 300-hp, 3.7-liter six-cylinder\nFront-wheel drive\nAvailable all-wheel drive with four- and six-cylinder engines\nSix-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters\nStandard Lincoln Drive Control\n\nSafety\nAmong the MKZ’s optional features are inflatable rear safety belts. Located on the outboard seating positions only, Lincoln says the class-exclusive option distributes the force of an impact more than a conventional seat belt to reduce head, chest and neck injuries. Safety features include:\n\nEight airbags\nElectronic stability system\nAvailable lane departure warning\nAvailable inflatable rear seat belts\nAvailable blind spot monitoring\n\nMKZ Hybrid\nLincoln promises the next-generation MKZ Hybrid will be the most fuel-efficient premium sedan, though no mileage numbers are available at the time of publishing; the 2012 MKZ Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 38/37 mpg city/highway. Lincoln MKZ Hybrid features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive\n141-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine\n47-hp electric motor for a combined 188-hp\nContinuously variable automatic transmission\nSimilar standard and optional features as non-hybrid MKZ\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid doesn’t scream hybrid. It’s not subscribing to any earthmobile movement in any other way than its hybridness, and that’s fine, because if you want your hybrid to proclaim its hybrid abilities with just its looks, you have other options. But if you just want some good, clean fuel efficiency and some style, too, then the MKZ Hybrid is your perfect match.\n\nWhat I liked most about the MKZ Hybrid, which is Lincoln’s first hybrid, is it felt solid. It wasn’t tinny-sounding when the doors were closed, and it didn’t make any squeaks or rattles. The MKZ Hybrid had some luxurious touches including wood trim and some sharp-looking design elements with plenty of chrome. I daresay it’s flashy! It left a nice impression on me, and it will on you, too.\n\nThis front-wheel-drive midsize sedan has the power to get you where you need to go, but if you’re looking for something to drag race, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I especially like that this hybrid comes from an American brand and is good-looking, too.\n\nThe 2011 MKZ has a starting MSRP of $34,645. My test car had a fancy package on it that bumped the price up to $41,370, including destination and delivery charges.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe MKZ Hybrid is a modern, sleek sedan, and it’s certainly not cheese-wedge shaped like many hybrids out there. The Lincoln only has a few hybrid badges to let others know you’re driving a green machine.\n\nIf you’re looking to make a good impression, the MKZ Hybrid delivers. The car is sporty and has some defining lines on the hood and tail end. The taillights are large, but look proportional to the rear end. The huge grille is definitely the MKZ Hybrid’s most polarizing feature, but I happen to like it. I like a little character and distinction with my cars.\n\nGetting in and out of the MKZ Hybrid is a piece of cake. The doors aren’t too heavy for the kids to open and close with ease. Smaller kids may need assistance with the doors, but what’s cool is the interior door pulls are close to the hinges, so kids don’t have to stretch too far to grab the handle to close the door from the inside.\n\nThe trunk is surprisingly roomy for a hybrid, but it has a small opening. That can make it difficult to load large strollers into it. It’s worth testing before buying.\n\nThe MKZ Hybrid has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine that’s paired with an electric motor to make a combined 191 horsepower. It can go up to 47 mph on electric power alone. The MKZ Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 41/36 mpg city/highway. While those aren’t exactly mind-blowing numbers, they are a significant improvement over the gas-powered MKZ with front-wheel drive that gets 18/27 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe MKZ Hybrid’s interior is where it really shines. Not literally; it literally shines on the outside with all that chrome. On the inside there’s a little shine but mostly some luxury-type touches. Like heated and cooled Bridge of Weir leather seats and the wood trim and chrome details I mentioned earlier. With ambient lighting to help set the mood, any journey will be blissful in this hybrid sedan.\n\nWhat I had fun with in the MKZ Hybrid was the instrument cluster, which Lincoln calls the Smart Gauge with EcoGuide technology. This futuristic display with its “Star Trek” readout will dazzle even the most jaded car nuts. Heck, I’m used to futuristic stuff in cars and I’m dazzled. The readout can be set to display a variety of information, including power, fuel efficiency or whatever. You can set the readout how you like, with the emphasis on power, fuel efficiency or whatever. When you’re driving efficiently, white flowers on the display add petals and leaves to indicate how you’re doing.\n\nThe MKZ Hybrid has a bad case of button madness. This is not a trait limited to Lincolns in general or the MKZ Hybrid in particular. From the driver’s seat, there aren’t many areas that aren’t begging for your attention. I happen to want to give my attention to the road.\n\nThe MKZ Hybrid may have a little more razzle-dazzle than your average hybrid, but it doesn’t overdo it in the features department. In the backseat, there are three seating positions and a fold-down armrest with a couple cupholders. That’s about it. There’s good legroom in the second row, and unlike many modern sedans that are going for the coupe look at the loss of some backseat headroom, no such issue exists in the MKZ Hybrid.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nOne of the nice things about such an uncluttered backseat in the MKZ Hybrid is that it’s just that. Uncluttered. There weren’t any problems with my kids using the seat belts on their own.\n\nThe two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats are clearly marked and easy to access. Hallelujah! There is room for a rear-facing infant seat in the MKZ Hybrid’s backseat.\n\nThe hybrid’s standard safety features include front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for both rows.\n\nMy test car came with an optional package that included a blind spot warning system with cross-traffic alert. Other optional safety features are adaptive headlights and a backup camera with parking sensors.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nThe Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size entry-luxury sedan that seats five. Power comes from a 245-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 350 or 400 hp. Both engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the MKZ offers front- or all-wheel drive. A front-wheel-drive gas-electric MKZ Hybrid is also offered. Competitors include the Acura TLX, Lexus ES and Volvo S60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nNew standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high-beam headlights. Rain-sensing windshield wipers are also now standard, and the MKZ Hybrid gets standard adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lincoln MKZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include an adaptive suspension, 18-inch aluminum wheels, rear parking sensors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, remote start, a push-button gear selector, a touchscreen multimedia system, heated front seats and a split-folding backseat. Available features include a power-adjustable steering column, a power trunk lid, a heated steering wheel, navigation, a choice of two Revel premium stereos, leather-trimmed seats, heated rear seats and inflatable rear seat belts.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lincoln MKZ?\n\nThe extra standard safety features are a welcome addition, and the MKZ has easy-to-use tech features, too. We like how the fuel-efficient MKZ Hybrid has the same starting price as the regular MKZ. There are some questionable design choices, however, like the car’s push-button gear selector.",
