      "expert_review": "Buying a 19951/2 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC can almost feel like investing in a piece of fine art. There’s the fact that it’s one of only a limited run of 5,000. There are stark artsy touches like no chrome on the bodysides or bumpers. And then there’s the Picasso-like price tag $43,550. But like any piece of art, the LSC (for Luxury Sport Coupe) evokes powerful emotional responses both positive and negative.\n\nShe: When I slid behind the wheel of that Mark VIII I wished the teacher who expelled me from Wendy Ward Charm School when I was 11 could see me now $43,000 would be a small price to pay for that kind of pleasure. She’d realize what a terrible mistake she made and what a big success I am now. You can’t tell me that people don’t buy cars for their retributive value. Besides, what was so awful about pelting her with atomic fireball candy from the back row?\n\nHe: You Catholic school girls are all the same. So the rebel inside you wants to show off with a glitzy luxury car? Why not buy a Jaguar or a BMW?\n\nShe: Those are far too low key. What I liked about the Lincoln are things that might turn off some buyers. The vestigial tire hump may be too much for some people. Same thing for the chrome grille. Granted, they’ve toned down the chrome a bit on the LSC, but in my case, I wish they’d have kept it. I also really fell in love with the “opal opalescent paint job. Doesn’t that sound like some kind of great nail polish?\n\nHe: You’ve just made the perfect case for my greatest concern this car is going to seem far too girlish and feminine for many male prospects. Imagine, for a moment, that you could drive the LSC without looking at the gaudy exterior, including that hideous phony spare tire. The Mark VIII really is a sensation to drive. It has a superb chassis, with self-leveling air suspension and front and rear stabilizer bars to limit body roll. The twin-cam V-8 has been goosed to nearly 300 horsepower, and it’s eager for you to put your foot into it. Although the car weighs nearly 2 tons, the speed-sensitive variable-assist steering is crisp and responsive, providing you with a surprising amount of feedback from the road. Too bad they couldn’t have wrapped it in a more macho set of clothes.\n\nShe: You lost me on the feedback from the road part. I only concern myself with feedback from old charm school teachers. But I can get beyond that, too. Some luxury cars leave you feeling great on the outside, but cold on the inside. But the Mark VIII’s perforated leather seats and redesigned instrument panel and console, in fact, the entire wraparound look of the cabin, made me feel like I was in a hot tub. And I wasn’t the only one who had that impression. One female passenger told me that Lincoln should give out bath salts with each purchase, because she had the same sensation, too.\n\nHe: They should give out sunglasses to any male buyers so your friends won’t recognize you.\n\nShe: Gee, you wouldn’t have lasted a minut e at Wendy Ward. While you’re preening and worried about what other guys will think of you, let me clue you in. The Lincoln not only does a lot for your psyche, but also it’s easy on the wallet. You can expect to pay $10,000 to $20,000 more for a comparable performance package in one of the imports. And for such a heavy car, the LSC gets terrific gas mileage up to 25 mpg on the highway.\n\nHe>: You’ve given me terrific gas in this test drive. And aren’t you forgetting little annoyances, like the fact that you have to pay $215 extra for traction control? You’ll never get through a Michigan winter without it in a heavy, powerful rear-wheel-drive car like the Mark VIII. In a $40,000 car, why would Lincoln want to nickel-and-dime you for the difference?\n\nShe: That was not a big concern to me. What bugged me was the memory seat settings. They reminded me of my VCR which I have yet to learn to program properly after 10 years. I know, I know. Read the manual. But I don’t have tim r that and the seat and mirrors were constantly moving into the wrong position when I got in.\n\nHe: That’s because I read the manual, so every time I got in the car, I just punched in my own memory setting. Too bad they don’t write a manual on how to balance your checkbook, huh? Or is that a sexist crack?\n\nShe: You’re just not in touch with your feminine side. And when I was 11, I wasn’t in touch with mine either. But I am now, so the Lincoln feels right.\n\nHe: Does that mean I have to pay a visit to Wendy Ward before I can learn to love the Lincoln?\n\nAnita’s rating: (outstanding)\n\nPaul’s rating: (outstanding)\n\nWhat we liked: Great performer; good value; zippy engine; lots of rear seat room\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Forgettable styling; generic cabin; watch out for blind spots; no ABS on test car.\n\nWhat we liked: More power than you need; supremely comfortable; glitzy cockpit and instrument panel; love the phony spare tire (Anita).\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Too much of a soft, feminine look (Paul); lose the phony spare tire (Paul); traction control should be standard; may be too gaudy for some.\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, four-passenger luxury/sport coupe.\n\nPrice: Base, $38,800; as tested, $43,550 (including a $640 destination charge).\n\nWhat’s new for 1995: LSC edition, redesigned instrument panel and audio system.\n\nStandard equipment: Perforated-leather power seats, power heated mirrors, alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift lever, full-length center console, burl-walnut inlays, rear defroster, door map pockets, tilt steering column, trip computer, automatic climate control, AM-FM stereo with cassette, four-wheel power disc brakes, tinted glass, automatic headlamps, keyless entry system, power door locks, power windows, cruise control, power steering, air-spring suspension and intermittent wipers.\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, antilock brakes, anti-theft alarm system and traction control (optional).\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Electronic traction control ($215), tri-coat paint ($300), power moonroof ($1,515), LSC package ($1,300), electrochromatic auto-dim mirror ($215) and premium JBL audio system ($565).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter V-8; 290 horsepower at 5750 rpm; 295 lb.-ft. of torque at 4500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Cadillac Eldorado, Buick Riviera, Lexus SC400, Acura Legend Coupe, BMW 840Ci, Jaguar XJS and Mercedes-Benz E320.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 113 inches; overall length, 207.3 inches; curb weight, 3,768 pounds; legroom, 42.6 inches front/32.5 inches rear; headroom, 38.1 inches front/37.5 inches rear; shoulder room, 58.9 inches front/59.5 inches rear.\n\nWhere built: Wixom, Mich.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,556\n\n*Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "God bless America.\n\nAs the world’s automakers march in lockstep toward one bland definition of luxury car (did anyone say Lexus?), cars like the big, brawny Lincoln Mark VIII LSC stand in defiance of that notion.\n\nAll Marks share their basic chassis and mechanical components with lesser cousins, the Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird. But Lincoln gives the car a rather distinct personality.\n\nStart with the styling. It’s an odd modernization of classic Mark styling cues, including a big, chrome-y grille up front and the traditional tire hump on the rear decklid. The rakish greenhouse rests on a muscular beltline that gives the car a sleek look from the side. The handsome, newly reintroduced LSC delivers a monochromatic paint job and optional chrome wheels, giving the car a go-fast look.\n\nWhere Lincoln really differentiates this car is under the hood. Although the Mark shares its 4.6-liter V-8 engine with its lesser cousins, it gets a double overhead camshaft rather than a single. This is good for 280 horses. Pop for the LSC model like the test car and you’ll get an extra 10 ponies. Hook that to a revised axle ratio, thicker stabilizer bars and beefy 225/60R16 tires, and you have a hustlin’ hotrod Lincoln.\n\nDual exhausts groan with delight as you explore the upper reaches of tachometer and speedometer. The bark is pure American muscle. There’s even a little hood vibration, just in case you miss that muscle car trait.\n\nBut don’t let that American demeanor fool you. This baby can handle the twisties. There’s a tremendous amount of grip and a purely neutral feel that only comes from a rear-drive automobile.\n\nThat said, this car weighs 3,767 pounds, so it never feels light on its feet. Similarly, despite its great handling, the power steering is a little too numb. The computer-controlled air suspension is firm and delivers a flat ride, but it does pound over large bumps, inducing some shudder in the car. Again, typically American in character.\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission delivered quick shifts, but can delay in downshifting in some situations. Four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, dual airbags and traction control are standard.\n\nInside, front seat passengers are treated to a sweeping bi-level dashboard. The basic design is imaginative and puts all major controls on the canted center console at the driver’s fingertips. These include the automatic climate control, rear defroster, audio system and trip computer. In front of the driver, the view to the gauges is unobstructed. The dash also gives the interior a cozy, cockpit like feel, although some might find it confining.\n\nWhile wood trim helps warm the inside, the plastics could have been of higher quality.\n\nThe power-operated front bucket seats are covered in leather of fine quality. The seats are excellent, providing good long-range support, yet with enough give to avoid discomfort. Rear-seat passengers are tak en care of as well, although legroom depends on how cooperative front-seat passengers are. It’s still awkward trying to stoop to get in the back, though.\n\nTrunk space, at 14.4 cubic feet, is good for a coupe. The trunk is usefully shaped, although not all that deep. The JBL audio system delivered good sound and features a 10-CD changer mounted in the trunk.\n\nWhile it no longer sports such gaudy accessories as opera lamps or vinyl roof, the current Mark is a muscular iteration of the classic American luxury coupe. Its refusal to be the suffocatingly suave import-like coupe means it stands apart, making this Lincoln a remarkable marque of Mark.\n\nMark VIII LSC Standard: 4.6-liter DOHC 32-valve V-8, four-speed electronic automatic transmission, P225/60R16 tires, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, cruise control, four-wheel disc power brakes with anti-lock, leather seating surfaces, floor mats, power front bucket seats, keyless entry O tional: Touring package (electronic traction assist, electrochromatic auto dim mirror, Ford-JBL AM/ FM cassette/CD with trunk-mounted CD changer), LSC chrome wheels, Luminarc headlights, power moonroof Base price: $39,650 As tested: $44,085 EPA rating: 18 mpg city, 26 mpg highway Test mileage: 24 mpg",

      "expert_review": "By now you will have discovered that the gift-wrapped lump beneath the tree was a life-size Godiva rhinoceros and not a 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII.  \n No matter. Tomorrow is Boxing Day, that blessed legacy of feudal Britain when a munificent gentry    boxed small gifts for distribution to a groveling but grateful peasantry.  \n In much the same search for popularity, the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury motor companies often choose the day after Christmas to distribute their new boxes. Ford Taurus, Thunderbird,  Escort and Lincoln Continental were all Boxing Day babies.   \n And Saturday, the Mark VIII enters showrooms as a further test of Ford’s expressed belief that people stuffed with warmth, peace, goodwill and dark meat are very likely to reward themselves by buying $40,000 luxury coupes. Especially if the best they do today is a Chia herb garden and a Salad Shooter.  \n Yet even as a present to oneself, is the Mark VIII a gift that will keep on giving?  \n Your call.  \n Although this first new Mark  in almost a decade certainly is a striking, powerful vehicle well qualified to occupy the high ground alongside today’s large and luxurious, it isn’t quite the unabashed, grand victor many had predicted.  \n Ford may well have stubbed its toe on         yesterday in its fixation on building a car for today’s younger, more discerning, certainly more spoiled buyer.  \n Dearborn’s intent with the Mark VIII was to lower the buyer profile from a 53-year-old with a household income of $75,000–formerly       hard-core Cadillac territory–to a 45-year-old with an income of $100,000–where Infiniti and Acura buyers and future luxury car sales live.  \n In this, Ford was simply following the successful furrow plowed earlier this year by Cadillac with its       lighter, brighter Seville STS and Eldorado.  \n As with Cadillac, Ford marketeers knew that a junior clientele would be wooed to Lincoln only if velvet power and ’90s lines were offered. Faithfulrepeat buyers could be retained only if Lincoln clung to a somewhat softer ride and styling traditions and therefore to the intrinsic elitism of the Marks.  \n Yet if styling and performance poked too far into the ’90s and not enough of the portly old guard was lost. . . .  \n Or if too much of the ancient    barge was retained until modern looks were reduced to mere accents. . . .  \n Well, Ford could only bet on red, spin the roulette wheel and rien ne va plus.  \n The result is a hybrid of ancient and modern, with success or failure of the ratio still   up for argument.  \n The Mark VIII has the shape of an aero soft-boiled ovoid associated with the Lexus SC400. But there are chrome strips down the side, a chrome grille and chrome accenting head and rear light assemblies, and that may be too much shiny stuff for modern, monochromatic eyes.  \n The car’s interior has been redesigned from Victorian front parlor into a sophisticated cockpit wrapping and cuddling a                                                                                             ll occupants. Just like the Nissan 300ZX and other imported sport coupes and grand tourers.  \n But there isn’t one scrap of richly polished wood to break up many square yards of a plasticized interior, so any sense of being in a luxury car is           completely lost.  \nTruth is, when encircled inside this leather-lined capsule, heavy on glass and F-16 nuances, one senses an eerie duplication of the new trio of cab-forward LH sedans from Chrysler. Which, it should be emphasized, is not all bad.      Except this luxury coupe costs $20,000 more than an LH.  \n One item bows deeply and sadly to King Kitsch while removing any doubts that the Mark VIII is a Rust Belt car: Its optional wheels are brushed aluminum pinwheels far too frilly for the dignity  of a Lincoln flagship. The standard wheels are straight-spoked and imply much more nobility.  \n Much has been made, mostly critical, of the Mark VIII’s fantail with its spare-tire bulge, a Lincoln trademark from about the time Henr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ford was building three-engine airplanes. Chrysler has dumped fins, and  Cadillac no longer offers mammary bumpers, goes the carping, so Lincoln is guilty of retro froufrou by designing a rear-deck bulge where a spare wheel no longer bulges.  \n What    critics seem to be ignoring is that as long as Rolls-Royce hangs on to square radiators and BMW sticks with twin grilles, where’s the hurt in reprising the quasi-Quasimodo look of Lincoln’s auspicious history?  \n The same argument applies to the        laid-back, chromium and vertically barred grille. Without it, the peasantry might not know this was a luxury Lincoln.  \n Now for the great news.  \n The Mark VIII comes with Ford’s new, 32-valve, 4.6-liter V-8 that is a mighty match for the Northstar engine GM uses in its reborn Cadillacs. The Ford power source issues 280 horsepower–10 short of Northstar, but more than Infiniti Q45 and Lexus LS400 and 30% more than the departing Mark VII.  \n Horsepower, however, doesn’t mean much until             intelligently mated with fuel induction, engine management and transmission systems. Most important is that power must come on very early in the acceleration cycle and not flag until forward progress fringes on the insane.  \n In the Mark VIII, 90% of   the torque is available almost from the get-go, so what once was a blundering bus is good for 0-60 times of 7.7 seconds–on a par with Infiniti Q45 and quicker than Lexus SC400.  \n In the mid-ranges–from 50 m.p.h. on up, where the majority of freeway klutzes seem to be doing their worst–the Mark VIII digs out like a scalded Tow missile.  \n How fast is that? Under sponsorship of Ford’s Specialty Car Development Group, a mostly stock, only lightly modified Mark VIII recently ran the Bonneville Salt  Flats at an average 181.7 m.p.h.  \n The new Lincoln’s chassis has been borrowed from the well-blooded Ford Thunderbird of established stiffness and polite handling.  \n The ride remains softer than most–another gesture toward the traditional Lincoln buyer–although stability is enhanced by self-leveling, speed-sensingair springs that raise or lower the car almost one inch.  \n Steering, however, is the pits.  \n It’s speed sensitive–which lightens turning pressures at slow speeds and weights     them for higher speeds–but the steering feels spongy. Finding center and precise wheel setting is a grope. Over-steering, then over-correcting, is a frequent problem, particularly during smarter lane changes. Or when holding position in lane between two  other cars.  \n The Mark VIII is longer, wider and approximately the same weight as the Mark VII. It feels shorter, narrower, much lighter and as nimble–here it is again–as Chrysler’s LH line.  \n The styling of the interior–with its terraced dash  and console panel for radio and climate controls canted toward the driver–is very contemporary.  \n But some parts of the design are flawed. For taller drivers, the                                                                                         comfortable seats do not travel far enough to the rear. Also, the rear-view mirror is set midway down the windshield, a huge distraction blanking about 30% of the driver’s right-side visibility.  \n Standard equipment–driver- and passenger-side air     bags, anti-lock brakes, leather seats, alarm system, remote power locking, automatic climate control–is everything you would expect to find on a luxury coupe.  \n Overall, the Mark VIII is an honest luxury car of genuine high performance. It clearly    deserves a center-stage role as the domestic industry improves its competitiveness against luxury imports.  \n Still, the car will require some refinement before assuming a lead in its class. Ford has said that will be done three years hence, a drastic shortening of the standard redesign cycle–another lesson Detroit has learned from the Asian punch-up.  \n Meanwhile, Ford can take much comfort from elevating its Mark class from overstuffed muscle cruiser to prime inter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ational threat.  \n1993 Lincoln Mark VIII  \nThe Good  Contemporary looks and technology for 50-year-old marque.

So if the restaurant is a lengthy trip from home, youhave hungry and ornery passengers.\n\nTwo doors just don’t do it unless you travel alone a lot.\n\nThe 1998 Lincoln Town Car and Continental sedans are much more roomy,comfortable and technologically advanced when it comes to suspension andsteering than the Mark VIII coupe.\n\nOne neat feature, however, is puddle lamps, lights under the outsidemirrors that flash on when you press the power-lock key fob. The lamps lightthe ground below the door so you don’t accidentally place the wingtips orheels in snow, mud or other unpleasant matter when entering or exiting thecar.\n\nThe lights also are brilliant enough to discourage the uninvited fromstrolling too close.\n\nNoteworthy features are dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes,all-speed traction control, fully independent air suspension andspeed-sensitive variable assist power steering.\n\nThe Mark VIII we tested starts at $39,320.

      "expert_review": "Ever since Ford Motor’s Lincoln-Mercury Division brought out the inaugural Lincoln Mark I, the car has been something of a trendsetter for highly styled luxury sports coupes.\n\nThe 1997 Lincoln Mark VIII continues this tradition and builds upon its heritage with emphasis on mechanical refinement, sports-oriented handling and upgraded, yet still distinctive styling.\n\nThe Mark VIII already was a pretty slick set of wheels that resided in the rather rarified air of luxury coupes. So, with Lincoln’s engineers and stylists moving forward, a good thing has been made even better.\n\nThe model’s overall theme is preserved, so that the Mark VIII is instantly recognizable. It is offered in standard and LSC (Luxury Sport Coupe) versions, with the LSC having its own styling cues and badging.\n\nThe LSC has a monochromatic appearance with body-colored molding on the headlights, taillights and decklid applique. There is a unique body-colored grille, body-colored side molding and special wheels.\n\nThe interior features perforated leather seats and “LSC” embroidered floor mats.\n\nWhile the front and rear styling changes make the new VIII different from its predecessors, the incorporation of new features puts the car in its own specific world.\n\nUp front, there is new styling that features a more prominent hood and a distinctive grille. It sets off the coupe’s low silhouette and sweeping aerodynamic lines.\n\nAt the rear end, the theme ought to be “Let there be light,” because there is lots of it.\n\nThe new rear styling features a neon-lighted taillight that sweeps across the full width of the car. The system gives Lincoln-Mercury Division a first, as it represents the first production application of neon taillights.\n\nAt 60 mph, this can help reduce the stopping distance of following vehicles by as much as 17 feet — as long as the guy behind you is awake.\n\nDesigners apparently were on a lighting campaign with the coupe, since they also developed advanced features for the headlights.\n\nFeatured in front is the Osram Sylvania Luminarc clear-lens headlight; these HID lamps produce 2.7 times more light than standard halogen bulbs.\n\nThe coupe also has been given halogen high-beam lights and new cornering lamps.\n\nThe VIII’s engineers have incorporated a couple of innovations that offer safety and convenience.\n\nThe exterior, electronically controlled rear-view mirrors have housings that contain supplementary turn signals on their trailing edge to alert following drivers.\n\nIn addition, these exterior mirrors turn down and become what Lincoln calls “puddle lamps” that illuminate the ground when the doors are unlocked using the remote-control key fob.\n\nThe Mark always has been a luxury automobile that is strong on individual touches. The 1997 coupe continues this theme with such personalized items as a power tilt and telescoping steering column with a memory system that returns the wheel and column to a set position upon entry to the driver’s seat.\n\nThe wheel also s lides away to provide more room for getting into and out of the car. The rear window has an in-glass antenna. As a deterrent to theft, a passive anti-theft system unit that immobilizes the engine is standard.\n\nThe motor is Lincoln’s four overhead-cam, four-valves-per- cylinder 4.6-liter V-8 that powered previous Marks, with 285 foot-pounds of torque for the standard Mark and 10 more foot-pounds for the LSC. Horsepower is 280 for the standard and 290 for the LSC.\n\nTo take advantage of the increased power, the new coupe has more precise steering and a retuned suspension to control body motion yet still give a comfortable ride.\n\nA Mark never has been cheap, but Lincoln has kept the cost in line with an manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $37,280.",
