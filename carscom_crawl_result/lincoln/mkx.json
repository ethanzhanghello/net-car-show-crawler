      "expert_review": "There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Aviator, a functional five-passenger sport utility vehicle that Lincoln sold from 2003 to 2005, except for timing and heritage.\n\nThe Aviator was built on the same truckish platform as the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer. That heritage would have been fine, but it came about a decade too late, because just as the Aviator hit the market, the consumer tide turned away from truck-based SUVs to the more carlike crossover SUVs, so named because they crossed over from the car side, rather than the truck side. The poor Aviator was doomed the moment it rolled into the showroom.\n\nIts replacement is the MKX, which is everything the Aviator wasn’t: Light on its feet, powered by a 265-horsepower V-6 instead of an old-school V-8, and extremely handsome, assuming you like your SUV styled like a boiled egg. Personally, I do. Just as the Aviator was based on the Ford Explorer, the MKX is based on the Ford Edge, and Lincoln designers have done a nice job of making the MKX look like a Lincoln, largely through a toothy but appropriate grille.\n\nThis is a good place to remind you that this SUV is the Lincoln MKX, not to be confused with the Lincoln MKZ, but of course it will be, as whatever Ford Mensa member who thought that an SUV and a car could successfully forge separate identities with a name that differs by one letter of the alphabet is dreaming. I keep them straight by remembering that the MKZ used to be the Zephyr, the Ford Fusion-based sedan.\n\nNone of this is the fault of the MKX, which is a very well-appointed sport-ute that is, as you’d expect, more at home at the valet parking stand than roughing it on the trails, even with the optional all-wheel-drive. It holds its own next to some tough competition, which ranges from the Cadillac SRX to the Lexus RX350.\n\nStandard equipment includes big 18-inch tires and machined aluminum wheels, leather upholstery, wood trim, an excellent stereo with an in-dash six-CD player, stability control and side and side-curtain airbags. Options on the all-wheel-drive test model included “White Chocolate Tricoat” paint ($495), heated and cooled front seats, autodimming side mirrors, chrome wheels, a reverse sensing system and the pricey ($4,795) “Elite Package,” which added a panoramic sunroof, Sirius satellite radio, a DVD navigation system and the knockout THX upgrade to the audio system. At the end, the base price of $35,770 swelled to $44,385.\n\nInside, luxury abounds, nicely executed. On the road, the MKX was a bit more sensitive to bumps than Lincoln customers might want, but the tradeoff, crisp handling, makes up for it. It may not be as rugged as an Aviator, but the MKX hits the crossover bullseye.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "I was surprised when one of my friends told me she bought the 2009 Lincoln MKX.\n\nIt’s a crossover I never considered someone under 30 might decide to make a long-term commitment.\n\nYes, she works at Ford Motor Co. so she wasn’t paying the full $37,845 for this five-passenger luxury crossover, but she really raved about it, so I thought it deserved a second look.\n\nWhen the test vehicle arrived, it looked stunning. All black, the body appears more truck like than car. The optional 20-inch wheels stuff up into the body (18-inch wheels are standard) and splashes of chrome sparkled in the sun. There’s a certain attitude about the MKX that I like — it’s the toughest Lincoln in the lot. The MKX looks luxurious, solid and well built and that’s not a bad combination.\n\nMy favorite feature on the body is how the rear tail lights stretch across the crossover’s entire body. Distinct looking vehicles, especially at night, are tough to come across nowadays, but the MKX is easily identifiable with its red band of light sitting above two chrome exhaust tips.\n\nWhile there are clear similarities between the MKX and the Ford Edge (Ford’s other five-passenger crossover built off of the same platform) there are also some clear differences. The Edge provides a much more utilitarian interior. The MKX is outright nice.\n\nSitting behind the leather wrapped wheel of the MKX, you find yourself surrounded with high-end materials and luxurious high tech amenities. Ford has adopted an incremental improvement policy that is good news for consumers. If a new Lincoln can come with something new, Lincoln puts it in. The MKX may have debuted as a 2007 model, but every model year Lincoln seems to add a new feature that’s far beyond new paint colors and wheel packages.\n\nThe 2009 MKX now offers a standard power lift gate, an optional voice activated navigation system, a front passenger grab handle, universal garage opener and cargo hooks in the back. No, it’s not a major overhaul, but it is refreshing attention to detail.\n\nWhen I got in, my head filled with the smell of leather, and I started to understand why someone might like the MKX so much. The high driving position and the comfortable seats make it good for long hauls. All of the space — fold down the second row and there’s 68.6 cubic feet of storage room — make it a smart choice for someone who needs to carry around a lot of stuff. It can haul the big screen TV, a stack of boxes or four other friends.\n\nMy test model included a $2,990 voice activated navigation system and a few other features I didn’t expect, such as heated second row seats and adaptive headlamps that turn with the MKX’s steering wheel. Then there were a lot of features I expected and enjoyed. SYNC, the voice operated infotainment system is still the best all around to talk on your phone, listen to your iPod and generally use. It’s almost too hip for Lincoln.\n\nThere’s a lot of luxury to get used to in the MKX.\n\nStarting it up, the MKX remained remarkably quiet. A true distinction to quality is the lack of outside noise seeping into the vehicle as you drive. The MKX provided an extremely quiet ride.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6, one of Ford’s new engines, provides 265 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of torque to give the MKX lots of power. The car-based platform gave the MKX a much more planted feel in its performance. While it may have the look of a compact SUV there was nothing truck-like in its performance. The wide track keeps the MKX firmly planted on the road and the six-speed automatic transmission provides smooth, clean acceleration.\n\nThe gas mileage seems low at 15 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for my all-wheel drive test vehicle (it’s 2 mpg better in both categories for the front-wheel drive model) but the sporty ride made up for the lack of mileage. Really, it was one of the crossovers I overall enjoyed driving. Many feel too numb on the road, devoid of personality. The MKX makes you enjoy the ride.\n\nThe rack-and-pinion steering provides nice return to center and remains well weighted in all types of driving. The weather remained nice during my testing so I never pushed the all-wheel drive system.\n\nThere were a few things I did not like in the MKX on the road. The seat feels almost too low in the cabin, making the dash feel too high. It creates a blind spot on the right and made me worry about hitting the curb on right hand turns. For a vehicle that feels much smaller than it is, the blind spot was one distraction I found worrisome.\n\nAfter 100 miles in the MKX, I wanted to keep driving. I could flip on the ventilated seats if things got too hot or adjust my side of the dual climate zone if it was too cold. The THX stereo provides the perfect back drop for highway driving and Sync means I never have to take my hands off of the wheel.\n\nI can understand why my friend bought the MKX. It’s sharp looking, versatile and provides a lot of features that young drivers would enjoy. It may never become a young person’s brand, but the MKX makes this brand feel a whole lot younger.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Ford and Lincoln-Mercury have not always done a stellar job of differentiating between common products.\n\nThere is, for example, no compelling reason to buy a Mercury Sable instead of its Ford twin, the Taurus. Ditto the Lincoln MKZ, the luxury version of that car.\n\nNot so with the Lincoln MKX (yes, this Lincoln penchant for naming vehicles MK-some initial is absurd and confusing, but we’ve beaten that dead horse). The MKX is a sport ute built on the same platform as the Ford Edge, and while they share a basic shape, there’s no mistaking the Lincoln’s flash. This is a great-looking vehicle, arguably the most handsome SUV on the market, and at night especially, our glow-in-the-dark test MKX, painted a lustrous “White Chocolate Tricoat” (a $495 option), sporting chromed 20-inch aluminum wheels (part of a $1,095 option package) and lit across the rear hatch with its trademark neonlike taillights — well, it would have been hard to sneak up on somebody.\n\nThe MKX interior isn’t quite as successful as its outside, but there’s still plenty of wood and leather and luxury features, such as heated and cooled seats, a superb sound system, and — thanks to a $4,595 “Elite Package” — a “panorama vista roof,” a voice-activated navigation system, and still another upgrade to the sound system. Add the $1,295 “Ultimate Package,” which gets you adaptive headlights that turn to the left or right with the steering wheel, plus a power rear liftgate, and you are lacking for nothing. You are also at $43,575 on the window sticker, and that’s for a front-wheel-drive MKX: If you want all-wheel-drive, that’ll be an additional $1,750.\n\nWhile all-wheel-drive is a nice safety feature — don’t mistake the MKX for an off-roader even with that feature — there are plenty of other safety features standard on the vehicle, including stability control, side airbags with an inflating safety canopy, antilock disc brakes and a reverse sensing system. It’s a little surprising that at this price, and in this class, the MKX has a beeping reverse sensing system, instead of a much more useful backup camera.\n\nIt would be nice to say that the Lincoln MKX has a different power train than the $26,000 Ford Edge, but it doesn’t: They share a 3.5-liter, 265-horsepower, V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. Fortunately, this is a pretty sophisticated, moderately powerful engine, and mated to the perceptive transmission, makes the Edge seem more expensive than it is, but still seems more than adequate for the MKX.\n\nA competitor, the Buick Enclave, has a 3.6-liter, 275-horsepower V-6 with a six-speed automatic transmission, so the MKX is in the ballpark.\n\nOn the road, Lincoln says one of the reasons you are paying more for the MKX than an Edge is because of features such as increased sound-deadening technology, and it shows: This is a very, very quiet SUV even at highway speeds. Ride and handling are on par with the competition, though steering feel is a bit distant and detached.\n\nThe front seats are roomy and comfortable, thanks to multiple adjustments, and the rear seat is big enough for three adults. There is no third-row seat.\n\nFuel mileage is a not-great 16 mpg city, 24 mpg highway, but that’s about what we’d expect from a 4,400-pound SUV. It runs fine on regular gasoline.\n\nUnless you need to carry more than five people, or tow massive trailers, the MKX is a very appealing alternative to bigger, thirstier luxury SUVs such as its own big brother, the Lincoln Navigator. It’s surprisingly nimble, great on the highway, and those looks don’t hurt a bit.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2010 about the 2011 Lincoln MKX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhile the Lincoln MKX gets an entirely new look inside and out and a more powerful engine for 2011, it didn’t win me over.\n\nThe corporate twin to Ford’s Edge, the oft-forgotten Lincoln MKX crossover’s most impressive change is a quiet, and comfortable ride that rivals Lexus and Acura. In addition, while it competes well with the best in its segment, it still needs work.\n\nExterior\nIt certainly wasn’t the MKX’s controversial looks that held me back. I like the large grille Lincoln has added to its vehicles; on larger models like the MKX, it almost looks natural.\n\nOne of my favorite design features on the previous-generation MKX (and the current MKT) is the single taillight stretching across the entire rear of the car. Unfortunately, it’s been replaced on the 2011 MKX by two sad-looking taillights. Overall, though, it’s a handsome SUV.\n\nEighteen-inch aluminum wheels are standard, but I expect most people will get one of the two option packages that include 20-inch wheels, like the ones on the tester I piloted. Surprisingly, the bigger wheels and chrome finish didn’t look at all garish.\n\nInterior\nOne of the bigger surprises about the new MKX is how nice the interior is. Other Lincolns have similar treatments — a leather-stitched dashboard and comfortable heated and cooled leather seats — but the MKX is the best of the bunch.\n\nThe two-tone color palette is pleasing, and there’s plenty of padding on the doors and center console for weary elbows.\n\nAll the leather appointments, though, are really just a backdrop to the real stars of this interior: the large steering wheel, digital gauge cluster and a slick center stack, featuring buttonless controls and a touch-screen LCD that overwhelm the driver (in a good way).\n\nI’ll dig into how well the multimedia system works later on, but in terms of basic functions, like air conditioning and the radio, the touch-sensitive console works well … for the most part. The buttons audibly click on and off instantly, and they’re as easy to find blindly as are any typical buttons.\n\nThe slider pads to control air-conditioning vent speed and stereo volume, however, don’t work so well.\n\nThe volume slides up and down steadily, but if you press too hard on either the right or left side, the volume jumps up or down. That’s intended; you can either push or slide to adjust the volume. But if you go in for the slide and your initial push is too hard, you get the jump rather than a smooth, steady adjustment.\n\nSeat comfort in back is very good, and it was more spacious back there for my passengers than was the Lexus RX 350 I tested a few days later. The spec sheet backs this up, with the advantage in rear dimensions going to the MKX. However, our child-safety seats proved to be tight fits in both models, though things were a bit better in the MKX. That didn’t stop constant seat kicking by my kids, though.\n\nThe cargo area was also impressively large, at 32.3 cubic feet. That area doesn’t beat the Lexus on the spec sheet — the RX has 40 cubic feet — but the MKX seemed larger for golf bags and large luggage, both of which I took with me on short runs in both SUVs.\n\nPerformance\nThe MKX’s best performance attributes are those that its rival, the Lexus, takes for granted.\n\nThis Lincoln glides softly on the road, with little wind and road noise. Even the optional 20-inch wheels didn’t raise the harshness factor. The only time I noticed a problem with the suspension was over harsh road imperfections, like expansion joints. Then, the MKX would give a significant jolt — albeit a brief one. It stood out mostly because its drive was otherwise so pleasant.\n\nThe MKX’s 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 interrupted that quiet drive every time I hammered down the accelerator. It’s an unusually impressive announcement of power in this segment. I enjoyed the grunt and hustle from the line quite a bit … until I got into that Lexus RX 350.\n\nThe Lexus may pack “just” a 275-hp V-6, but it’s plenty swift and it feels more refined than the MKX. It just doesn’t have the resonating engine roar of that SUV. Like many Lexus vehicles, you can barely tell the engine is there, even when you’re pushing your right foot down hard.\n\nBrakes on both SUVs were competent, though certainly not stellar. Mileage is also similar, with front-wheel-drive MKXs getting 19/26 mpg city/highway and the RX getting slightly less, at 18/25 mpg. All-wheel-drive versions of the MKX, like my tester, obviously have lower numbers, coming in at 17/23 mpg. The all-wheel-drive RX loses less, at 18/24 mpg.\n\nAs a driver’s car, the RX handled better, leaned less during tight turns — like highway off-ramps — and had a silkier transmission. What was the Lexus’ unlikely Achilles heel? It had an overly tight suspension that sent shudders through the cabin that were downright maddening on rough roads.\n\nI could easily see a luxury shopper picking the Lincoln’s more comfortable but slightly less refined driving experience over the RX 350. That’s saying a lot for Lincoln.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nLincoln continues to add a lot of features standard across its lineup, but when it comes to pricing, the MKX still costs slightly more than a similarly equipped Lexus RX.\n\nLincoln does, however, have two standout features that Lexus can’t match.\n\nOne is a simple panoramic sunroof that has two gigantic panes of glass. The front pane that slides open is a significant size, adding a nice open-air feeling to the SUV. Lexus, on the other hand, has just a standard sunroof available. Both cars include the sunroofs as part of pricey option packages.\n\nThe Lincoln’s other wow-inducing feature is the standard MyLincoln Touch system, a new endeavor by Ford to bring more technology into its automobiles. One part of the system is a customizable gauge cluster with an analog speedometer flanked by two LCDs that can show a variety of information in different ways, from a trip computer to a compass to heat settings.\n\nThere was no question as to the appeal of this aspect of MyLincoln Touch.\n\nBut then there was the multimedia system. The system is standard, including an 8-inch touch-screen and a number of features. (Navigation, however, is part of a $7,500 option package.)\n\nI was impressed by how easy it was to set up the Bluetooth system for my iPhone and the display for my iPod tracks. The optional THX sound system was good, but not nearly as robust as the Lexus RX’s upgraded system. And other than all that, I found the MyLincoln Touch system to be a dismal failure.\n\nEvery touch command is delayed a tick too long, which makes this very advanced-looking system feel like an antiquated one. While some of the buttons have a visual effect like water rippling when you touch them, that doesn’t overcome the fact that my radio station didn’t change instantly.\n\nAs in systems from Audi and BMW, some functions — like whether you want your climate-controlled air directed at your feet, head or both — are in this LCD system versus having physical controls down below. And don’t get me started on trying to turn on the heated seats.\n\nI found the navigation graphics to be a bit behind some of the better systems on the market. It was also nearly impossible to point to a part of the map and adjust the view, or to select a road incident to see what exactly it was.\n\nAdd a black screen and tiny fonts, and I’m not sure Gen Xers — let alone baby boomers — will enjoy hunting for the controls they need.\n\nRemote start, dual-zone climate control, Ford’s Sync voice-recognition system, a 10-speaker sound system, heated and cooled leather seats up front, a power liftgate, parking sensors and 18-inch aluminum wheels are standard for the MKX’s $39,145 starting price for front-wheel drive and $40,995 for all-wheel drive.\n\nThere are only two option packages: a $2,500 Premium Package that adds xenon headlamps, ambient interior lighting, premium leather seats, heated rear seats, a rearview camera, a heated steering wheel with power tilt and telescoping, and rain-sensing wipers. The $7,500 Elite Package adds voice-activated navigation, a blind spot warning system, a THX surround-sound stereo system with HD radio, a panoramic moonroof, and 20-inch, chrome-clad aluminum wheels.\n\nAll told, our tester came to $51,635. A similarly equipped Lexus RX 350 with the largest available wheels (19 inches) and that smaller moonroof comes in at $49,168. Buyers may have a hard time reconciling the higher price for what is essentially a newcomer versus the well-known quantity of the Lexus.\n\nSafety\nThe MKX has the standard slate of six airbags, stability control and, as part of some option packages, blind spot monitoring.\n\nThe 2011 MKX earned the top score, Good, in frontal, side and rear crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the second best score, Acceptable, in roof-strength tests, keeping it from being an IIHS Top Safety Pick, a vaunted designation.\n\nThe federal government has not yet crash-tested the MKX.\n\nLincoln MKX in the Market\nA worthy competitor to Acura and Lexus is a welcome thing for car shoppers. More options and selection mean better odds of finding the right vehicle for you. Besides the wonky multimedia system in the MKX, there isn’t anything to turn off prospective buyers.\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives by leaps and bounds, and I even like the styling. But after living with the MKX, I just couldn’t get excited about it. It was a gut reaction, even as my brain told me how great it was. I suspect the features and pleasing ride, though, will win over many shoppers’ tentative guts.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "While the Lincoln MKX gets an entirely new look inside and out and a more powerful engine for 2011, it didn‘t win me over.\n\nThe corporate twin to Ford’s Edge, the oft-forgotten Lincoln MKX crossover’s most impressive change is a quiet, and comfortable ride that rivals Lexus and Acura. In addition, while it competes well with the best in its segment, it still needs work.\n\nExterior\nIt certainly wasn’t the MKX’s controversial looks that held me back. I like the large grille Lincoln has added to its vehicles; on larger models like the MKX, it almost looks natural.\n\nOne of my favorite design features on the previous-generation MKX (and the current MKT) is the single taillight stretching across the entire rear of the car. Unfortunately, it’s been replaced on the 2011 MKX by two sad-looking taillights. Overall, though, it’s a handsome SUV.\n\nEighteen-inch aluminum wheels are standard, but I expect most people will get one of the two option packages that include 20-inch wheels, like the ones on the tester I piloted. Surprisingly, the bigger wheels and chrome finish didn’t look at all garish.\n\nInterior\nOne of the bigger surprises about the new MKX is how nice the interior is. Other Lincolns have similar treatments – a leather-stitched dashboard and comfortable heated and cooled leather seats – but the MKX is the best of the bunch.\n\nThe two-tone color palette is pleasing, and there’s plenty of padding on the doors and center console for weary elbows.\n\nAll the leather appointments, though, are really just a backdrop to the real stars of this interior: the large steering wheel, digital gauge cluster and a slick center stack, featuring buttonless controls and a touch-screen LCD that overwhelm the driver (in a good way).\n\nI’ll dig into how well the multimedia system works later on, but in terms of basic functions, like air conditioning and the radio, the touch-sensitive console works well … for the most part. The buttons audibly click on and off instantly, and they’re as easy to find blindly as are any typical buttons.\n\nThe slider pads to control air-conditioning vent speed and stereo volume, however, don’t work so well.\n\nThe volume slides up and down steadily, but if you press too hard on either the right or left side, the volume jumps up or down. That’s intended; you can either push or slide to adjust the volume. But if you go in for the slide and your initial push is too hard, you get the jump rather than a smooth, steady adjustment.\n\nSeat comfort in back is very good, and it was more spacious back there for my passengers than was the Lexus RX 350 I tested a few days later. The spec sheet backs this up, with the advantage in rear dimensions going to the MKX. However, our child-safety seats proved to be tight fits in both models, though things were a bit better in the MKX. That didn’t stop constant seat kicking by my kids, though.\n\nThe cargo area was also impressively large, at 32.3 cubic feet. That area doesn’t beat the Lexus on the spec sheet – the RX has 40 cubic feet – but the MKX seemed larger for golf bags and large luggage, both of which I took with me on short runs in both SUVs.\n\nPerformance\nThe MKX’s best performance attributes are those that its rival, the Lexus, takes for granted.\n\nThis Lincoln glides softly on the road, with little wind and road noise. Even the optional 20-inch wheels didn’t raise the harshness factor. The only time I noticed a problem with the suspension was over harsh road imperfections, like expansion joints. Then, the MKX would give a significant jolt — albeit a brief one. It stood out mostly because its drive was otherwise so pleasant.\n\nThe MKX’s 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 interrupted that quiet drive every time I hammered down the accelerator. It’s an unusually impressive announcement of power in this segment. I enjoyed the grunt and hustle from the line quite a bit … until I got into that Lexus RX 350.\n\nThe Lexus may pack “just” a 275-hp V-6, but it’s plenty swift and it feels more refined than the MKX. It just doesn’t have the resonating engine roar of that SUV. Like many Lexus vehicles, you can barely tell the engine is there, even when you’re pushing your right foot down hard.\n\nBrakes on both SUVs were competent, though certainly not stellar. Mileage is also similar, with front-wheel-drive MKXs getting 19/26 mpg city/highway and the RX getting slightly less, at 18/25 mpg. All-wheel-drive versions of the MKX, like my tester, obviously have lower numbers, coming in at 17/23 mpg. The all-wheel-drive RX loses less, at 18/24 mpg.\n\nAs a driver’s car, the RX handled better, leaned less during tight turns — like highway off-ramps — and had a silkier transmission. What was the Lexus’ unlikely Achille’s heel? It had an overly tight suspension that sent shudders through the cabin that were downright maddening on rough roads.\n\nI could easily see a luxury shopper picking the Lincoln’s more comfortable but slightly less refined driving experience over the RX 350. That’s saying a lot for Lincoln.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nLincoln continues to add a lot of features standard across its lineup, but when it comes to pricing, the MKX still costs slightly more than a similarly equipped Lexus RX.  \n\nLincoln does, however, have two standout features that Lexus can’t match.\n\nOne is a simple panoramic sunroof that has two gigantic panes of glass. The front pane that slides open is a significant size, adding a nice open-air feeling to the SUV. Lexus, on the other hand, has just a standard sunroof available. Both cars include the sunroofs as part of pricey option packages.\n\nThe Lincoln’s other wow-inducing feature is the standard MyLincoln Touch system, a new endeavor by Ford to bring more technology into its automobiles. One part of the system is a customizable gauge cluster with an analog speedometer flanked by two LCDs that can show a variety of information in different ways, from a trip computer to a compass to heat settings.\n\nThere was no question as to the appeal of this aspect of MyLincoln Touch.\n\nBut then there was the multimedia system. The system is standard, including an 8-inch touch-screen and a number of features. (Navigation, however, is part of a $7,500 option package.)\n\nI was impressed by how easy it was to set up the Bluetooth system for my iPhone and the display for my iPod tracks. The optional THX sound system was good, but not nearly as robust as the Lexus RX’s upgraded system. And other than all that, I found the MyLincoln Touch system to be a dismal failure.\n\nEvery touch command is delayed a tick too long, which makes this very advanced-looking system feel like an antiquated one. While some of the buttons have a visual effect like water rippling when you touch them, that doesn’t overcome the fact that my radio station didn’t change instantly.\n\nAs in systems from Audi and BMW, some functions — like whether you want your climate-controlled air directed at your feet, head or both — are in this LCD system versus having physical controls down below. And don’t get me started on trying to turn on the heated seats.\n\nI found the navigation graphics to be a bit behind some of the better systems on the market. It was also nearly impossible to point to a part of the map and adjust the view, or to select a road incident to see what exactly it was.\n\nAdd a black screen and tiny fonts, and I’m not sure Gen Xers — let alone Baby Boomers — will enjoy hunting for the controls they need.\n\nRemote start, dual-zone climate control, Ford’s Sync voice-recognition system, a 10-speaker sound system, heated and cooled leather seats up front, a power liftgate, parking sensors and 18-inch aluminum wheels are standard for the MKX’s $39,145 starting price for front-wheel drive and $40,995 for all-wheel drive.\n\nThere are only two option packages: a $2,500 Premium Package that adds xenon headlamps, ambient interior lighting, premium leather seats, heated rear seats, a rearview camera, a heated steering wheel with power tilt and telescoping, and rain-sensing wipers. The $7,500 Elite Package adds voice-activated navigation, a blind spot warning system, a THX surround-sound stereo system with HD radio, a panoramic moonroof, and 20-inch, chrome-clad aluminum wheels.\n\nAll told, our tester came to $51,635. A similarly equipped Lexus RX 350 with the largest available wheels (19 inches) and that smaller moonroof comes in at $49,168. Buyers may have a hard time reconciling the higher price for what is essentially a newcomer versus the well-known quantity of the Lexus.\n\nSafety\nThe MKX has the standard slate of six airbags, stability control and, as part of some option packages, blindspot monitoring.\n\nThe 2011 MKX earned the top score, Good, in frontal, side and rear crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the second best score, Acceptable, in roof-strength tests, keeping it from being an IIHS Top Safety Pick, a vaunted designation.\n\nThe federal government has not yet crash-tested the MKX.\n\nLincoln MKX in the Market\nA worthy competitor to Acura and Lexus is a welcome thing for car shoppers. More options and selection mean better odds of finding the right vehicle for you. Besides the wonky multimedia system in the MKX, there isn’t anything to turn off prospective buyers.\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives by leaps and bounds, and I even like the styling. But after living with the MKX, I just couldn’t get excited about it. It was a gut reaction, even as my brain told me how great it was. I suspect the features and pleasing ride, though, will win over many shoppers’ tentative guts.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2016 about the 2016 Lincoln MKX, but little has changed with this year’s model. For details on the 2017 MKX, click here, or see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe 2016 Lincoln MKX is transformed in a big way, with a complete interior and exterior overhaul upping Lincoln’s game in the luxury SUV market. Compare the 2016 with the outgoing 2015 MKX here. Its base 303-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine carries over, while the star of the show is a newly available 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 that’s optional on all trim levels: Premier, Select, Reserve and Black Label, from least to most expensive.\n\nI drove a Reserve trim with the optional EcoBoost engine and all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nWhile Buick has commercials touting its exterior design as so un-Buick that people won’t recognize a new one when they see it, Lincoln walks the walk; the redesigned 2016 MKX’s styling is easily on par with its German luxury competitors. The MKX is an attractive midsize luxury SUV with masculine yet classy curves. It makes for a bold presence. Intricate available LED headlights and a distinct lack of gaudy, fake chrome bring class to this midsize luxury SUV. It’s a welcome change; in its previous generation, the MKX lacked anything in the styling department to make it stand out in a crowd.\n\nOne hitch in the overall effect is the cheap-looking, dull-gray lower body cladding that stretches over the fenders and surrounds the bottom of the whole SUV. Most luxury SUVs use some sort of body cladding like the Lincoln’s, including the wildly styled Lexus RX, which has minimal accents, or the BMW X3, which features prominent cladding on lower trim levels that’s only painted on certain trim packages. Lincoln’s MKX concept gave us an idea what the SUV could look like without the cladding, but the production MKX’s ugly body cladding is here to stay on every trim level.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nMore powerful optional engines are commonplace in luxury SUVs, and the MKX gets one of those too for 2016. With 335 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque, the 2.7-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 makes 32 more horsepower and a whopping 102 more pounds-feet of torque than the base, naturally aspirated V-6. All that power is welcome given the hefty 4,447-pound curb weight of an all-wheel-drive MKX with EcoBoost engine, and it’s the kind of scoot a luxury SUV deserves. (Front-wheel drive also is offered with this engine, as it is with the base V-6.)\n\nThe EcoBoost is a must-have option for its refinement and on-demand power, combined with EPA-estimated gas mileage that matches the base engine in front-wheel-drive models. With all-wheel drive, its fuel economy is 1 mpg better in EPA-estimated city and highway ratings, though it carries the same 19 mpg combined rating as the 3.7-liter (it’s a rounding thing based on raw data). While there’s no mpg hit with the EcoBoost, wallets will be hit with the $2,000 it takes to add it. It really isn’t that bad, though, considering the minimum $5,000 needed to get from a base, turbocharged BMW X3 or Audi Q5 four-cylinder to the more-powerful six-cylinder available in each. Compare the MKX with those competitors here.\n\n“Athletic” doesn’t really describe how the MKX drives and handles. It’s bigger than the similarly priced X3 or Q5, which are more fun to drive. The MKX better executes comfort and ride quality, with a well-isolated cabin keeping wind and road noise on the outside and a chassis that keeps pitted roads from ruining the interior experience. The MKX does have a sporty side to it in Sport mode, where the engine and transmission are more responsive and the adaptive suspension tightens up to reduce body motion in cornering. Lincoln’s adaptive suspension with adjustable firmness is included with all-wheel drive, which adds $2,495 to the price of an MKX.\n\nInterior\n\nThe MKX’s interior won’t drop any jaws with its conservative design, especially compared with something like the new Lexus RX. Still, material quality is impressive in areas such as the aluminum accents of the optional Revel stereo on the door panel, plus the attractive and authentic wood accents on the door panel, steering wheel and center console. Compare the MKX with the RX here.\n\nElsewhere, the MKX’s luxuriousness falls short, including the window and power mirror switches and the buttons for the push-button transmission gear selector. I actually don’t mind using the vertically aligned gear selector buttons, especially while performing three-point turns, given Reverse and Drive are conveniently close to the steering wheel. I’d hoped Lincoln would class-up the buttons themselves, though, which are similar to those in the entry-level MKC SUV.\n\nThe bland and flat center control panel and dashboard also are eerily similar to the MKC both in material quality and design. Lincoln missed an opportunity here to craft a unique and high-quality design.\n\nComfort is king in the MKX. The optional “Bridge of Weir” branded leather on Select and above trim levels is plush as it wraps the supportive and cozy seats. Heated front seats are standard, and an optional $595 Climate Package adds a heated steering wheel and heated rear seats.\n\nOne MKX feature is unparalleled in the luxury SUV segment, and that’s the optional 19-speaker Revel stereo that’s included in the $4,400 Luxury Package on Reserve trims. I don’t recall being impressed with a factory stereo as much as this one since the first examples of Audi’s Bang & Olufsen. The Revel’s chest-thumping power is reminiscent of a powerful home theater system. It’s especially rewarding when listening to high-quality music, not a compressed MP3 file.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nWhat’s most important to remember is that MKXs already are rolling off the assembly line with Sync 3. Early-production MKXs manufactured in late 2015 have the old, outdated, hard-to-use MyLincoln Touch with the 8-inch touch-screen, which was what our test car had. Thankfully, the system now is controlled with real buttons and dials instead of capacitive touch-sensitive controls, but it’s still an aging, outgoing system. Sync 3, which we’ve tested in Ford models, is vastly improved, with an easier-to-use interface.\n\nThe 8-inch multimedia screen also displays the optional 360-degree camera, which is part of a $1,720 Technology Package that shows a top-down view of the SUV constructed from multiple cameras. We’ve used similar 360-degree cameras in other luxury and non-luxury cars, and this particular one isn’t done very well. The separate camera images aren’t stitched together in a very useful way, and the provided guidelines make it hard to tell where the wheel rests in relation to a curb. The 360-degree camera in Nissans, Infinitis and BMWs provide a more useful form of this feature that’s indispensable for parking.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nGargantuan cargo space is a big advantage of the MKX compared with smaller but similarly priced luxury SUVs. The MKX measures 37.2 cubic feet behind the backseat, while the Audi Q5 has 29.1 cubic feet of space, the BMW X3 27.6 cubic feet and the RX 18.4 cubic feet.\n\nIf sheer size isn’t enough, a power liftgate with a kick-to-open function is included on Select trim levels and higher, in which swiping a foot under the rear bumper automatically opens the power liftgate. It’s a feature that becomes very hard to do without at the grocery store after you get used to having it.\n\nUp front, the MKX’s innovative multi-tiered center storage console provides multiple layers of storage, though the opening isn’t big enough to place or retrieve items quickly.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Lincoln MKX received a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency’s highest score. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t performed its full battery of crash tests, but the MKX received the agency’s best score of good in moderate-overlap front and side crash tests. If more results are published, they will appear here.\n\nLike the 360-degree camera, another bit of technology that could use refining is the optional lane keeping assist, which corrects the SUV’s path when it starts to drift out of its lane. But the MKX’s action isn’t as refined as other systems; it jerks the steering wheel instead of gently moving the car back into its lane. Luckily, there are various modes to adjust system sensitivity for a more relaxed operation, as well as just an alert mode that won’t take any self-correcting action.\n\nLane keeping assist is included in a $1,650 Driver Assistance Package along with adaptive cruise control, which also includes Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Protection. Pre-Collision Assist automatically brakes if it detects an imminent collision, and it can also identify pedestrians. The sensitivity of the system is adjustable via the digital dashboard menu. A complete list of safety features is here, and you can see how well the MKX carries child-safety seats here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe MKX competes with a wide range of similarly priced luxury SUVs at its $39,025 starting price, including smaller ones such as the BMW X3 ($39,945) and Audi Q5 ($41,825) and more appropriately sized competitors such as the Lexus RX ($42,840). The MKX is the only one of those to offer standard heated seats, and only the BMW matches its standard memory driver’s seat. The MKX’s available Revel high-end stereo, adaptive safety features, adjustable-firmness suspension and turbocharged V-6 are also requisite offerings among luxury SUVs.\n\nWhere the MKX comes up short is in offering a floor-to-ceiling luxury experience. There are top-notch executions in some areas, but you won’t find the complete package you’ll get in the Lexus RX’s stylishly crafted interior. All tallied up with $12,550 worth of options, our test car was priced $61,125. The MKX’s interior styling is just a little too conservative, too much like the entry-level MKC, to really stand out in this class for its asking price.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2016, the new Lincoln MKX is a striking-looking midsize luxury SUV featuring an overhauled, but less interesting, interior.\n\nVersus the competition: The MKX’s knockout features and size advantage over similarly priced compact luxury SUVs may not be enough to capture buyers interested in an immersive luxury experience.\n\nThe 2016 Lincoln MKX is transformed in a big way, with a complete interior and exterior overhaul upping Lincoln’s game in the luxury SUV market. Compare the 2016 with the outgoing 2015 MKX here. Its base 303-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine carries over, while the star of the show is a newly available 335-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 that’s optional on all trim levels: Premier, Select, Reserve and Black Label, from least to most expensive.\n\nI drove a Reserve trim with the optional EcoBoost engine and all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile Buick has commercials touting its exterior design as so un-Buick that people won’t recognize a new one when they see it, Lincoln walks the walk; the redesigned 2016 MKX’s styling is easily on par with its German luxury competitors. The MKX is an attractive midsize luxury SUV with masculine yet classy curves. It makes for a bold presence. Intricate available LED headlights and a distinct lack of gaudy, fake chrome bring class to this midsize luxury SUV. It’s a welcome change; in its previous generation, the MKX lacked anything in the styling department to make it stand out in a crowd.\n\nOne hitch in the overall effect is the cheap-looking, dull-gray lower body cladding that stretches over the fenders and surrounds the bottom of the whole SUV. Most luxury SUVs use some sort of body cladding like the Lincoln’s, including the wildly styled Lexus RX, which has minimal accents, or the BMW X3, which features prominent cladding on lower trim levels that’s only painted on certain trim packages. Lincoln’s MKX concept gave us an idea what the SUV could look like without the cladding, but the production MKX’s ugly body cladding is here to stay on every trim level.\n\nHow It Drives\nMore powerful optional engines are commonplace in luxury SUVs, and the MKX gets one of those too for 2016. With 335 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque, the 2.7-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 makes 32 more horsepower and a whopping 102 more pounds-feet of torque than the base, naturally aspirated V-6. All that power is welcome given the hefty 4,447-pound curb weight of an all-wheel-drive MKX with EcoBoost engine, and it’s the kind of scoot a luxury SUV deserves. (Front-wheel drive also is offered with this engine, as it is with the base V-6.)\n\nThe EcoBoost is a must-have option for its refinement and on-demand power, combined with EPA-estimated gas mileage that matches the base engine in front-wheel-drive models. With all-wheel drive, its fuel economy is 1 mpg better in EPA-estimated city and highway ratings, though it carries the same 19 mpg combined rating as the 3.7-liter (it’s a rounding thing based on raw data). While there’s no mpg hit with the EcoBoost, wallets will be hit with the $2,000 it takes to add it. It really isn’t that bad, though, considering the minimum $5,000 needed to get from a base, turbocharged BMW X3 or Audi Q5 four-cylinder to the more-powerful six-cylinder available in each. Compare the MKX with those competitors here.\n\n“Athletic” doesn’t really describe how the MKX drives and handles. It’s bigger than the similarly priced X3 or Q5, which are more fun to drive. The MKX better executes comfort and ride quality, with a well-isolated cabin keeping wind and road noise on the outside and a chassis that keeps pitted roads from ruining the interior experience. The MKX does have a sporty side to it in Sport mode, where the engine and transmission are more responsive and the adaptive suspension tightens up to reduce body motion in cornering. Lincoln’s adaptive suspension with adjustable firmness is included with all-wheel drive, which adds $2,495 to the price of an MKX.\n\nInterior\nThe MKX’s interior won’t drop any jaws with its conservative design, especially compared with something like the new Lexus RX. Still, material quality is impressive in areas such as the aluminum accents of the optional Revel stereo on the door panel, plus the attractive and authentic wood accents on the door panel, steering wheel and center console. Compare the MKX with the RX here.\n\nElsewhere, the MKX’s luxuriousness falls short, including the window and power mirror switches and the buttons for the push-button transmission gear selector. I actually don’t mind using the vertically aligned gear selector buttons, especially while performing three-point turns, given Reverse and Drive are conveniently close to the steering wheel. I’d hoped Lincoln would class-up the buttons themselves, though, which are similar to those in the entry-level MKC SUV.\n\nThe bland and flat center control panel and dashboard also are eerily similar to the MKC both in material quality and design. Lincoln missed an opportunity here to craft a unique and high-quality design.\n\nComfort is king in the MKX. The optional “Bridge of Weir” branded leather on Select and above trim levels is plush as it wraps the supportive and cozy seats. Heated front seats are standard, and an optional $595 Climate Package adds a heated steering wheel and heated rear seats.\n\nOne MKX feature is unparalleled in the luxury SUV segment, and that’s the optional 19-speaker Revel stereo that’s included in the $4,400 Luxury Package on Reserve trims. I don’t recall being impressed with a factory stereo as much as this one since the first examples of Audi’s Bang & Olufsen. The Revel’s chest-thumping power is reminiscent of a powerful home theater system. It’s especially rewarding when listening to high-quality music, not a compressed MP3 file.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhat’s most important to remember is that MKXs already are rolling off the assembly line with Sync 3. Early-production MKXs manufactured in late 2015 have the old, outdated, hard-to-use MyLincoln Touch with the 8-inch touch-screen, which was what our test car had. Thankfully, the system now is controlled with real buttons and dials instead of capacitive touch-sensitive controls, but it’s still an aging, outgoing system. Sync 3, which we’ve tested in Ford models, is vastly improved, with an easier-to-use interface.\n\nThe 8-inch multimedia screen also displays the optional 360-degree camera, which is part of a $1,720 Technology Package that shows a top-down view of the SUV constructed from multiple cameras. We’ve used similar 360-degree cameras in other luxury and non-luxury cars, and this particular one isn’t done very well. The separate camera images aren’t stitched together in a very useful way, and the provided guidelines make it hard to tell where the wheel rests in relation to a curb. The 360-degree camera in Nissans, Infinitis and BMWs provide a more useful form of this feature that’s indispensable for parking.\n\nCargo & Storage\nGargantuan cargo space is a big advantage of the MKX compared with smaller but similarly priced luxury SUVs. The MKX measures 37.2 cubic feet behind the backseat, while the Audi Q5 has 29.1 cubic feet of space, the BMW X3 27.6 cubic feet and the RX 18.4 cubic feet.\n\nIf sheer size isn’t enough, a power liftgate with a kick-to-open function is included on Select trim levels and higher, in which swiping a foot under the rear bumper automatically opens the power liftgate. It’s a feature that becomes very hard to do without at the grocery store after you get used to having it.\n\nUp front, the MKX’s innovative multi-tiered center storage console provides multiple layers of storage, though the opening isn’t big enough to place or retrieve items quickly.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Lincoln MKX received a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency’s highest score. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t performed its full battery of crash tests, but the MKX received the agency’s best score of good in moderate-overlap front and side crash tests. If more results are published, they will appear here.\n\nLike the 360-degree camera, another bit of technology that could use refining is the optional lane keeping assist, which corrects the SUV’s path when it starts to drift out of its lane. But the MKX’s action isn’t as refined as other systems; it jerks the steering wheel instead of gently moving the car back into its lane. Luckily, there are various modes to adjust system sensitivity for a more relaxed operation, as well as just an alert mode that won’t take any self-correcting action.\n\nLane keeping assist is included in a $1,650 Driver Assistance Package along with adaptive cruise control, which also includes Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Protection. Pre-Collision Assist automatically brakes if it detects an imminent collision, and it can also identify pedestrians. The sensitivity of the system is adjustable via the digital dashboard menu. A complete list of safety features is here, and you can see how well the MKX carries child-safety seats here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe MKX competes with a wide range of similarly priced luxury SUVs at its $39,025 starting price, including smaller ones such as the BMW X3 ($39,945) and Audi Q5 ($41,825) and more appropriately sized competitors such as the Lexus RX ($42,840). The MKX is the only one of those to offer standard heated seats, and only the BMW matches its standard memory driver’s seat. The MKX’s available Revel high-end stereo, adaptive safety features, adjustable-firmness suspension and turbocharged V-6 are also requisite offerings among luxury SUVs.\n\nWhere the MKX comes up short is in offering a floor-to-ceiling luxury experience. There are top-notch executions in some areas, but you won’t find the complete package you’ll get in the Lexus RX’s stylishly crafted interior. All tallied up with $12,550 worth of options, our test car was priced $61,125. The MKX’s interior styling is just a little too conservative, too much like the entry-level MKC, to really stand out in this class for its asking price.\n\nemail",
