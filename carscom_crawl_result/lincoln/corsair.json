      "expert_review": "Lincoln is rounding out its SUV lineup with the reintroduction of its smallest utility vehicle, which gets both a redesign and name change. The 2020 Corsair replaces the MKC, which means there are no more SUVs from Lincoln that have silly, meaningless letters for a name.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lincoln Corsair Pricing Starts in High 30s, Can Speed Past $60K\n\nThough this is the smallest and least expensive Lincoln, I had high hopes for the Corsair. Lincoln has been walking the roadmap that Volvo embarked upon a few years earlier, which has worked out extremely well for the Swedish automaker. Both companies had some similarities a few years ago, making vehicles that we describe as premium — a way of saying that they weren’t quite nice enough to be considered luxury.\n\nThen Volvo introduced a redesigned XC90 in 2016, bestowing its largest SUV with a higher level of styling, technology and luxury materials that then trickled down to the rest of its SUVs and passenger cars. The smaller XC60 and XC40 also became staff favorites after they included much of same aesthetics, features and rich appointments. It seems that Lincoln has taken a similar approach, starting with the jumbo-sized Navigator, which gave way to the Aviator. Now comes the culmination of that strategy, the compact Corsair. (What about the Nautilus, you ask? That was more of a name change and a refresh rather than a redesign or the introduction of a brand-new vehicle, as the other three were. As such, I was not as impressed with it when I reviewed it.)\n\nI headed to San Francisco and Carmel, Calif., to see if the Corsair could likewise swashbuckle its way into my good graces (the pirate puns will not stop, sorry) at Lincoln’s media introduction. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker sponsored events.)\n\nSmooth Sailing\n\nTechnically, the word “corsair” can refer to either a pirate ship or the pirate itself, which feels confusing since you have a corsair on a corsair. All I know is that this corsair would choose the Corsair to be his corsair for any long voyage, because Lincoln has done a fantastic job with the SUV’s ride quality and quietness.\n\nThough the Corsair is closely tied to the Ford Escape — which got a full redesign of its own for 2020 — there are a few key differences. One of those is the suspension setup: The Corsair has a multilink rear suspension with upgraded bushings, a more capable (and expensive) setup that allows the rear to be compliant for a smooth ride without feeling sloppy.\n\nYou feel this when you push the Corsair on curvy roads, as I did on the drive from San Francisco down to Carmel. As the SUV turns into a corner, the body leans noticeably (as is common in all SUVs). Where many of those vehicles get tripped up is that once the body leans (or “rolls,” as we gearheads say), the suspension rebounds too much and unsettles the vehicle for a second time. Not so in the Corsair; the suspension does an excellent job of resetting the rear once body roll happens, and by the time you exit the corner, it feels completely flat and balanced again so you can jump back on the power with confidence. Both Corsairs I drove were equipped with the optional adaptive suspension, as well, which varies shock absorber firmness automatically based on conditions, so I can’t comment on the standard suspension as of yet.\n\nLincoln said keeping the cabin serene was a point of emphasis on the Corsair, and it shows. You do detect some wind and tire noise, but I didn’t realize how quiet it was until I was able to have full conversations with our videographer, Jonathan, in the backseat without turning my head or raising my voice at all even over stretches of rougher road. On a dock with wooden planks, the cabin remained delightfully oblivious to the exterior conditions.\n\nEngines Good, Transmission Overboard\n\nI got to test both of the Corsair’s engine choices, each turbocharged four-cylinders. The standard engine is a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the optional (and more exciting) engine is a 295-hp, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder that also makes a whopping 310 pounds-feet of torque (versus 280 pounds-feet in the 2.0-liter). Both vehicles I tested also came with all-wheel drive, though front-wheel drive is standard.\n\nThe good news is that buyers will be happy with the performance you get from either engine. The base engine is more than up to the task of moving the Corsair with some haste, though not as much as the optional engine — when that engine kicks, the Corsair surges forward rapidly, and with the SUV’s smooth ride, it’s easy to surge past speed limits and not even realize it.\n\nThere is, however, one large problem, and it felt to me to be the one thing holding the Corsair back from overarching greatness: the transmission. The Corsair might have a unique suspension setup compared with the Escape, but this time it doesn’t dodge the bullet and ends up with the same eight-speed automatic transmission. When fellow reviewer Kelsey Mays tested the new Escape, he noted that “The new eight-speed resists downshifts while in motion until the accelerator is halfway to the floor.” I had much the same experience in the Corsair, but perhaps to an even greater degree as it’s about 300 pounds heavier than the Escape, trim level depending.\n\nThe end result is a disconnect between accelerator pedal action and forward motion even in the Corsair’s sportier Excite drive mode — and in Excite, it became harder to launch the Corsair smoothly. In Normal mode, the vehicle was smoother off the line and also seemed to accelerate faster. Once you get going, Excite offers a more responsive pedal and quicker downshifts, but not quick enough to mitigate the laggy feeling entirely. This does bother you less with the optional engine because the added power helps to overcome the timing deficiencies more quickly once you get going, but it’s present with both engines and definitely puts a damper on the experience.\n\nOne quick caveat: The vehicles we tested were all filled with premium gasoline, which in California is 91 octane. Much like with the Ford vehicles, these engines will run on regular 87-octane fuel and I didn’t see any requirements or caveats on the fuel doors that I checked (the EPA’s fuel economy ratings cite the Corsair’s fuel requirement as regular gasoline). Lincoln bases its horsepower and torque figures on 93-octane fuel, which its engines are designed to exploit for more power; not all vehicles that run on regular get any benefit from premium, so it’s likely that you’ll lose a bit of power if you opt to fill up with the cheaper stuff. When AAA tested several “premium-recommended” vehicles in 2017 for premium versus regular fuel, power increased 1 to 2 percent on average; I don’t foresee this being a problem for the Corsair, however, because both of its engines had power to spare.\n\nCaptain’s Grade Quarters\n\nThe Corsair’s interior is a delight, with impressive materials quality, design and efficient use of space. Soft leather adorns most of the surfaces you’d touch regularly, including where your knees come in contact with the center console. The only exception would be some hard plastic atop the dashboard and the top of the windowsills, but that’s sort of par for the course for this class. Impressively, the backseat doesn’t see much drop-off in quality save for the back of the front seats, which are hard plastic shells.\n\nWhat immediately stands out up front is the unique way the Corsair presents its climate and seat controls. They sit on what can best be described as a shelf, with the shift buttons appearing as a balcony of sorts above them. I am not usually a fan of shift buttons versus a traditional gear selector, but I’m happy with it in this application for two reasons: The buttons are easy to use, and Lincoln has taken full advantage of the space it has opened up by placing a second storage cubby underneath the shelf. It’s big enough to fit a few items, including a larger phone, and houses both a USB-A and USB-C port. There are two more USB charge ports for the backseat and an optional three-prong household outlet back there, as well.\n\nThe back of the cabin is also where the Corsair showcases an intelligent maximization of space. There is plenty of headroom and legroom for adult passengers to fit comfortably, and there are large windows all around, which makes the cabin feel open — even more so if the giant dual-pane panoramic moonroof option is added. Those large windows also aid with driver visibility, and the rear-quarter windows between the C- and D-pillars in particular have grown — viewable area has increased by 300 percent, Lincoln says — which helps out a lot with that tricky passenger-side blind spot.\n\nAnother way that the Corsair uses its compact footprint efficiently is a sliding backseat with 6 inches of travel for both sides of the 60/40-split rear bench. The seat will stay slid all the way back for maximum legroom most of the time, but for those occasions when you have to carry both passengers and cargo, this gives you some extra breathing room. Lincoln performed a demonstration where the Corsair was loaded with four large suitcases in the cargo area, which necessitated sliding the seat forward a few inches. Even with that, Jonathan and I were able to sit on the driver’s side, one behind the other, comfortably (we are both roughly 6 feet tall).\n\nThe touchscreen is a hair too small. It’s an 8-inch screen rather than the 10-inch screen (measured diagonally) that you find in the Aviator — I think the 10-incher would have been a welcome addition here. It’s powered by the excellent Sync 3 multimedia system that I enjoy for its simplicity and ease of use, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay both come standard. The Corsair also gives owner the options of using their phone as a key so you don’t even need to carry the key fob, but I don’t see much added functionality with that technology yet. You can open the windows and the liftgate through the app, but other automakers offer this capability through apps, too — I’m hoping the technology evolves and this is just a precursor to something like transferable driver profiles between vehicles, which is not yet a reality.\n\nSolid Safety Technology — With a Flaw\n\nStandard safety offerings are decent. Lincoln’s Co-Pilot 360 is found on every Corsair and it includes forward emergency warnings and automatic braking with pedestrian detection, lane keep assist, automatic high beams and blind spot warnings. Our test vehicle was also equipped with Co-Pilot 360 Plus, which added adaptive cruise control, speed-limit sign recognition and evasive steering assist.\n\nThese systems worked as advertised, and I found myself especially impressed with a lane-keeping system that did a good job of centering the Corsair in its lane without making a lot of adjustments, which can make the front end feel busy in other vehicles. I did run into one problem on the drive, which involved both the adaptive cruise control and speed-limit sign recognition.\n\nThe adaptive cruise control offers an “intelligent” setting, which will automatically adjust the vehicle’s speed if the speed limit changes. If you’re traveling in a 65-mph speed zone with the adaptive cruise control set at 65 mph, you encounter some construction and the speed limit drops to 55 mph, the cruise will automatically reduce your speed to match. (The system will let you set your cruise higher than the limit and will keep the same difference, say 5 mph above the posted limit, when it changes based on a sign.) At one point on the highway however, I felt the car speed up and looked down to see that the system had somehow read an 85-mph speed limit sign and bumped our cruising speed up accordingly.\n\nI don’t know what the system read, but there are no roads with a speed limit over 70 mph in California, so I had to quickly roll my speed way, way back down. This does mean that if you choose to use this mode rather than the regular set-it-yourself adaptive cruise, you’ll have to be careful and watch your speed. Lincoln is not the only automaker that has struggled with implementing this technology in the U.S., where each state is free to design its own signage and set speed limits.\n\n2020 Lincoln Corsair | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nBuried Treasure\n\nThe Corsair builds upon what the Navigator and Aviator started, with a fantastic cabin, solid engines and easy-to-use technology and safety features. Yes, the transmission is a nagging annoyance, but it’s not enough on its own to dampen my enthusiasm — this is a solid, welcomed entrant into the luxury compact SUV class, and I think it’ll challenge the competition to try to match its level of passenger comfort and cargo flexibility.\n\nCorsair pricing does jump up quickly. Both of the examples that I tested came out in the mid-to-high $50,000s — $59,660 for the vehicle with the optional engine and $54,875 with the standard. At these prices, I’d have gunned for the more expensive of the two, which had the better engine and more features to boot. Check out our pricing post for the full details. Competitors in this class can also reach this price range, so the Corsair isn’t alone in this space, and I think this Lincoln makes a good arrrrr-gument for itself against those vehicles.\n\nThe Corsair goes on sale in the fall.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The smallest offering in the Lincoln luxury showroom has received a refresh for the 2023 model year, bringing with it some minor styling refinements, new tech, new colors and a new multimedia system. Most of the 2023 Corsair is unchanged from prior years, but with other models in the Lincoln lineup (like the redesigned 2024 Nautilus we recently saw) seeing some serious improvements, it was time for the Corsair to get a mild update to keep up with its siblings. And while the majority of the changes to the new Corsair are minor, they add up to an intriguing offering in a crowded field of competitors.\n\nRelated: 2024 Lincoln Nautilus Preview: A Stunning Display of Stunning Display\n\nClassy Looks\n\nFrom the outside, the new Corsair isn’t much different from the outgoing 2022 model — you have to know what you’re looking for to figure out which model year is which. The ‘23 has a new, larger grille and LED running lamps, but perhaps the best thing that can be said about the Corsair’s look is that it doesn’t resemble in the slightest the vehicle upon which it is based — the Ford Escape. It features a totally different look, with classier trim, genuinely artful proportions and design details, and a more luxurious look to the Escape’s more mundane, ordinary styling. Not much was wrong with the Corsair’s look prior to this mild nose job, and not much is wrong with it now. But I do wonder how it will fare once the new ‘24 Nautilus arrives with its new Lincoln look that eschews the upright grille in favor of a much more horizontal, wider design. This freshening will do for now, but a new Corsair had better be in the pipeline for the next few years.\n\nPowertrains Unchanged, for Better or Worse\n\nPowering your ‘23 Corsair is a choice of two drivetrains: a standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a robust 250 horsepower and 275 pounds-feet of torque or an optional plug-in hybrid version combining a non-turbo 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined 266 hp (torque figures for the system weren’t available as of publication).\n\nMy test vehicle was an all-wheel-drive Grand Touring trim featuring the plug-in hybrid drivetrain. I’ve tested this powertrain before in both the 2021 Escape PHEV and the older Corsair, and it’s a fantastic hybrid drivetrain — it packs plenty of power in normal operation, and it also lets you run the engine, depending on drive mode, to maintain a charge for later in the lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nBut one of the foibles of this powertrain is that it never lets you stay in EV mode if the SUV decides it shouldn’t be. Other PHEVs, like the Toyota RAV4 Prime, remain in all-electric operation when the battery has a charge unless something extraordinary happens, like flooring the accelerator pedal, that pulls you out of it because the electric motor alone can’t keep up. But this PHEV powertrain will fire up the engine whenever it thinks it should, even if you have it set to EV mode.\n\nThis makes it problematic as an actual PHEV, as many PHEV owners like having all-electric operation along with the peace of mind of a range-extending gas engine. But the philosophy behind the Corsair’s PHEV system is less “range-extended EV” and more “super-efficient hybrid,” with the goal of the plug-in system and larger battery instead being to maximize your fuel economy rather than your EV operation.\n\nAnd in that regard, it’s perfectly acceptable. The system is genuinely peppy and seamless, with smooth and quiet operation that gives you good acceleration when you want it and nearly silent around-town motoring when you’re just commuting or cruising the streets. No official fuel economy estimates have been published yet for the ‘23 Corsair PHEV, but the ‘22 model has an EPA rating of 33 mpg combined and up to 28 miles of electric range, and that’s about what I saw in my brief time with the vehicle. This is an improvement from the base turbocharged gas engine’s EPA rating of 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined for a 2023 Corsair with AWD, but not as much as one might expect given the gas-electric powertrain.\n\nStill Artful, Now With More Science\n\nThe interior of the Corsair has always been a highlight — as have frankly most Lincolns these days — with an opulent mix of fine materials, tasteful brightwork, and the retention of actual buttons and switches for controls rather than full touch-sensitive interfaces (Lincoln tried that years before anyone else and learned their lesson). The front seats are comfortable; there’s acceptable room in the backseat (this is a compact SUV, after all, so you shouldn’t be expecting massive amounts of passenger space); and there’s a suitably sized cargo area. The Corsair delivers a quiet, opulent driving experience that will genuinely surprise you in how calm it is — the whole “Quiet Flight” marketing idea Lincoln has been touting is real, not just an advertising slogan. The Corsair feels like it punches above its weight class, delivering a beautifully composed, luxurious drive that eschews sporting pretense for comfortable coddling. I dig this direction for Lincoln.\n\nMy Grand Touring trim had all the bells and whistles one expects at this price level, but for 2023, two new additions are what Lincoln is focusing on. Yes, there are some new color palettes inside, and they do look good, but the arrival of ActiveGlide 1.2 and the Sync 4 infotainment system with a new touchscreen are the things Lincoln would like to point to for 2023.\n\nActiveGlide 1.2 is Lincoln’s latest and greatest hands-free driving system. You might have also heard it referred to as BlueCruise in Ford models; it’s essentially the same thing, but Lincoln needed to make it sound fancier (but has actually dropped that name in the 2024 Nautilus, which has BlueCruise, so whatever). New for ‘23 is its ability to change lanes autonomously, with the driver asking it to do so by activating the turn signal while the system is active. It also can better, more naturally adjust the Corsair’s position in its lane and will also now slow upon entering corners.\n\nPerhaps the best thing anyone can say about any hands-free driving system is that it works and does so without hinky episodes that make your butt clench and make you grab for the steering wheel in a panic. Lincoln’s ActiveGlide system and Ford’s BlueCruise don’t do that: They work quite well, enabling a calm “driving” experience when technically you’re not really the one driving — the car is.\n\nLike GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system, the ActiveGlide system requires you to pay attention at all times — and monitors you to make sure you’re doing so, observing your head and eye position to make sure you’re not nodding off, eating a burger or playing with your phone. The system maintains speed, lane position and steers with a confidence-inspiring smoothness. Lane changes are also non-events; just tap the stalk, and if the way is clear, it will pull you out and accelerate you into the lane you have chosen. It’s not quite as advanced as the latest Super Cruise system, however; that system automatically detects whether it can go around the car in your way and does so without any driver input required before slotting you back into your original lane once you’ve passed the slower traffic. It’s a bit more next-level than ActiveGlide 1.2’s latest abilities, but I have no doubt that Lincoln is working on adding that capability soon enough.\n\nNot All the Tech Is Grand\n\nWhile the improvements to ActiveGlide are impressive and work beautifully, the same cannot be said for the new multimedia screen, a larger 13.2-inch horizontally oriented touchscreen running an updated Sync 4 system. While its organization and menu system are easier to use, and it’s simpler to find various features, the operation itself is oddly laggy, with noticeable delays between selecting a menu feature and being able to use it. In a world where this kind of thing has been largely eliminated in just about every automaker’s onboard screens, this came across as surprising and disappointing, and I half wonder if this was simply an early production example in need of a software update (which can now be done over the air, according to Lincoln). If the actual released software is this laggy on this big, shiny touchscreen, Lincoln customers who have been waiting months for their ‘23 Corsairs to arrive might be disappointed at how the multimedia system performs. For their sake, I hope this was just an issue with my test vehicle and not a characteristic of the production-intent system.\n\nAvailable Now\n\nPricing for the new ‘23 Corsair is competitive with the rest of the class, if perhaps a bit on the high side for a loaded example. It starts with the Standard trim that rings in at just a tick over $40,000 (all prices include the destination fee) and stretches up to the Grand Touring PHEV that starts at $55,280. Add in all the bells and whistles like the multi-way Perfect Position front seats, a slick red leather interior, fancier paint colors, bigger wheels and tires, and you can top out over $67,000 for a loaded model.\n\nAt lower prices, the Lincoln represents an excellent value for a punchy, quiet, genuinely luxurious driving experience in a compact SUV. At the top end of the price range, however, it’s stretching that value equation rather thin, as there are many other entries in the segment that vie for your worthy attention, many of them from the traditional German luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, or even Porsche if you’re looking to go sporty with a lower-trim Macan.\n\nLincoln’s update to the Corsair should keep it interesting for people who already intended to go down that ownership route. But given what we’ve seen of Lincoln’s upcoming models with the redesigned Nautilus, we’re really excited about what might be next for the Corsair in a few years’ time.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Lincoln Corsair: New Face, New Features\nUpdated 2022 Lincoln Navigator Gains ActiveGlide Hands-Free Steering\nLatest Version of Ford BlueCruise, Lincoln ActiveGlide Adds Hands-Free Lane Changing\nResearch the 2023 Lincoln Corsair\nShop for a 2023 Lincoln Corsair\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Benz GLC350e, Lexus NX Hybrid\n\nLooks like: The recently introduced Corsair with some blue badges\n\nPowertrains:  An estimated 266-horsepower system; 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder gas engine and hybrid electric motor; continuously variable transmission; standard all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2020\n\nLincoln has added another plug-in-hybrid SUV to its lineup with the unveiling of the new 2021 Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring. Like the larger, more expensive Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring, the Corsair Grand Touring is a plug-in model, differentiating it from its Ford Escape Hybrid cousin and featuring a considerably different powertrain and standard all-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: More 2019 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nExterior\n\nOn the outside, not much is different on the Grand Touring. The only clues that this is the PHEV version of the new Corsair are the unique grille with blue Lincoln star badge, special 20-inch wheels, a charge port door on the front left fender and Spirit Blue badging elsewhere on the vehicle.\n\nInterior\n\nLikewise on the inside, there are very few cues to let you know that you’re in a different version of the Corsair. You still get the same swanky, spacious, multi-adjustable interior that you get in other versions of the new compact crossover, but the differences might not become known until you start driving. Additional sound-dampening materials and active noise cancellation technology should combine with the electric operation of the Corsair Grand Touring to make the crossover even quieter.\n\nYou still get sliding second-row seats with 6-inch fore-and-aft travel and 60/40-split, folding rear bench. The Corsair Grand Touring’s battery is packaged flat and under the floor, and Lincoln says that the cargo area can still accommodate four full-size suitcases or four sets of golf clubs — but it very carefully does not say if the Grand Touring actually provides less cargo room than non-hybrid trims, only that luggage space and legroom have been “maximized.” Up front, the 24-way adjustable Perfect Position seats are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nHere’s where we get to some big differences from other versions of the Corsair. The powertrain is a combination of a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder gas engine and an electric motor mated to an electric continuously variable transmission that, itself, employs two small electric motors to drive the gears. This all drives the front wheels, with a Lincoln-estimated combined system output of 266 horsepower. The rear wheels are driven solely by a dedicated electric motor (that’s four electric motors in total, if you’re keeping score) that’s employed when all-wheel drive is called for. The battery pack is a 14.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion unit, which Lincoln says should be good for at least 25 miles of full-electric operation. Charging takes 10 to 11 hours on a Level 1, 120-volt household outlet, dropping to three to four hours on a Level 2, 240-volt charger. DC fast charging capability is apparently not available.\n\nThere are several drive modes that can be employed by the user, depending on conditions. The Corsair’s Normal mode operates as a typical hybrid, with the vehicle deciding when to employ both powertrains for optimal efficiency. The Conserve mode is meant to dull vehicle responses, allowing for smoother (slower) operation that acts as an “Eco” mode. When you get bored with that, Excite operates as a Sport mode, firming up pedal responses and suspension damping, and improving battery-coolant flow for anticipated heavy electrical draws. Slippery mode reduces power to the wheels and slows throttle response for slippery conditions, and Deep Conditions changes pedal progression and power output to accommodate deep snow or dry sand.\n\nIn addition to these, you can opt for Pure EV mode to keep the Corsair Grand Touring in electric-only operation (until the battery runs out) or Preserve EV mode, which maintains and even charges the battery using the gas engine, enabling a recharge of up to 75 percent and allowing the driver to employ Pure EV mode later in their drive. This is useful for commutes to an area that employs a congestion charge, allowing the driver to leave the house with a full or partial charge and still use highways without depleting the battery before arriving in an area that charges internal combustion a fee.\n\nSafety\n\nAs with other models, Lincoln Co-Pilot360 is standard, and includes precollision assist with automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection with cross-traffic alert, automatic lane keep assist, a rearview camera and automatic high beams. You can upgrade to Lincoln Co-Pilot360 Plus, which adds adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist, evasive steering assist, reverse automatic emergency braking and active park assist plus. You can also add a head-up display for an additional fee.\n\nThe new Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring is set to grace the Lincoln showroom in summer 2020, with pricing announced closer to the on-sale date.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Nov. 21, 2019, to accurately characterize the Corsair’s all-wheel-drive system.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Lincoln Corsair?\n\nThe Lincoln Corsair is a five-seat compact luxury SUV that is Lincoln’s smallest, most affordable vehicle. It shares its basic platform with the Ford Escape, but with luxury-level styling, trim and features inside and out. The base powertrain is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 250 horsepower and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nAlso available is a Grand Touring plug-in hybrid version that’s powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that teams with an electric motor, a continuously variable automatic transmission and standard AWD. It’s rated at 266 hp, with an estimated 27 miles of electric-only driving range. Corsair competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Cadillac XT4, Genesis GV70, Infiniti QX50 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lincoln Corsair?\n\nThe Corsair rolls into 2025 with only minor changes to color and appearance package availability.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Lincoln Corsair Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nNavigation\nThree USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nNine-speaker stereo system\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nLeather upholstery\nAmbient interior lighting\n14-speaker Revel audio system\nActiveGlide hands-free driving assist system\nPanoramic moonroof\nRain-sensing wipers\nShould I Buy the 2025 Lincoln Corsair?\n\nThe Corsair is a worthy choice for compact luxury SUV shoppers who want a smooth, unflustered ride and a cushy cabin. Though it handles just fine in everyday driving — and its powertrains provide more than sufficient acceleration — the Corsair doesn’t aspire to be sporty, which helps it stand out against European rivals. However, the Corsair’s prices climb alarmingly quickly as you ascend the trim ladder and add options; at the higher end of its model range, the Corsair is an uncompelling value proposition when pitted against class rivals that are a bit more spacious inside.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lincoln Corsair?\nThe Lincoln Corsair is a five-seat compact luxury SUV that is Lincoln’s smallest, most affordable vehicle. It shares its basic platform with the Ford Escape, but with luxury-level styling, trim and features inside and out. The base powertrain is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 250 horsepower and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. \nAlso available is a Grand Touring plug-in hybrid version that’s powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that teams with an electric motor, a continuously variable automatic transmission and standard AWD. It’s rated at 266 hp, with an estimated 27 miles of electric-only driving range. Corsair competitors include the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Cadillac XT4, Genesis GV70, Infiniti QX50 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. \nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lincoln Corsair?\nThe Corsair’s entry-level trim has been renamed Premiere for 2024, but there are no significant updates. A refresh last year added a larger standard touchscreen, subtle exterior and interior revisions, and the availability of Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free driving system. \nWhat Features in the 2024 Lincoln Corsair Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nVoice recognition\nNavigation\nThree USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nNine-speaker stereo system\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nLeather upholstery\nAmbient interior lighting\n14-speaker Revel audio system\nActiveGlide hands-free driving assist system\nPanoramic moonroof\nRain-sensing wipers\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lincoln Corsair?\nThe Corsair is a worthy choice for compact luxury SUV shoppers who want a smooth, unflustered ride and a cushy cabin. Though it handles just fine in everyday driving, and its powertrains provide more than sufficient acceleration, the Corsair doesn’t aspire to be sporty, which helps it stand out compared with European rivals. However, the Corsair’s prices climb alarmingly quickly as you ascend the trim ladder and add options; at the higher end of its model range, the Corsair is an uncompelling value proposition when pitted against class rivals that are a bit more spacious inside.",
