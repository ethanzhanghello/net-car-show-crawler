      "expert_review": "It surpasses anything the division has built in the past.\n\nThe company really shifted gears in creating a luxury automobile surpassing anything the division has built in the past.\n\nVirtually a technological revolution on wheels, the list of innovative features is virtually unending. Computerized electronics play a strong role, with a transmitter that that can unlock doors and adjust seats, mirrors and radio stations for individual drivers.\n\nAnd under the hood lies a change that should have been made earlier.\n\nNestled in a transverse position between the front driving wheels lurks a V8 with four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder. The 4.6-liter (281-cubic-inch) engine replaces the rocker arm/push rod 3.8-liter V6 used previously.\n\nDriving the Continental that Ford’s Bill Carroll provided for a test car was like affirming that everything is right with the world.\n\nThis luxury sedan qualifies as a world-class automobile with virtually every feature you ever wanted in a motor car as standard equipment. The electronics almost require filing an airliner flight plan on first encounter, and when all else failed we read the owner’s manual for directions.\n\nAfter a short time behind the wheel, the controls become familiar. It’s almost like pushing a button and making a wish.\n\nThe driver’s seat slid forward to a predetermined position on entrance, and retracted when the engine was turned off and the key removed.\n\nPushing a button selects low, normal or high steering effort. The same applies to soft, normal or firm ride.\n\nI can’t say there was any real major change between these selections, so we just left everything in normal.\n\nIf you feel the need, you can check all the car’s systems via digital readouts on the information panel. Being a trusting soul, I just assumed everything was okay and took off.\n\nAt this point, the 32- valve V8 made the difference between what a Continental should be and what it used to be.\n\nThe engine was incredibly smooth, whisper quiet, and the power made itself known. Two hundred sixty horses got to shuffling and a moderately heavy luxury sedan went forth.\n\nMated to this engine is the Continental’s AX4N automatic four-speed transaxle, redesigned to accommodate the higher torque of the V8.\n\nThe Continental isn’t meant to be road- racing machine, so if you go into a sharp corner rather hot, the front end would push on you. But that takes sort of a running-on-the-edge style of motoring.\n\nDriving fast without trying to look like Mario Andretti, the car felt secure at all times and gave no indication of playing tricks.\n\nThe air suspension provided the expected luxury-car ride. Over uneven pavement, the tires go “thumpy-thump,” and that’s about it.\n\nOn the interstate, the body’s aerodynamic configuration kept wind noise at a minimum. And it felt like you could ride all day without fatigue.\n\n?The exterior styling is a matter of personal taste. I got the impression that the Continental was styled to fit the requir ements of a wind tunnel, so its lines follow a rather bland theme.\n\nThe interior is much more distinctive. Here the sedan reeks of class, with leather and the accouterments of comfort and convenience.\n\nThere was a plethora of leg and headroom. Seating was spacious and comfortable. Ducting carried the air conditioning (in the winter, heat) to the rear seats.\n\nThere’s an overhead-console-mounted microphone for a voice-actuated cellular phone. And there are instrument- panel readouts for the phone’s status.\n\nLast but not least, there’s a storage compartment for a Lincoln umbrella. After all, there’s nothing quite like spending almost $43,000 to get an umbrella.\n\n1995 Lincoln ContinentalBase price: $40,750.As tested: $42,885.Type: Front engine, front-wheel drive, five- passenger, luxury sedan.Engine: 4.6-liters, DOHC V-8, 32 valves, fuel injected, 260-horsepower, 265 foot-pounds of torque..Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Accelerati on: 0-60 mph, 7.7 seconds.Mileage: 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway.Wheelbase: 109.0 inches.Length: 206.3 inches.Width: 73.3 inches.Height: 55.9 inches.Curb weight: 3,969 pounds.Options: Traction control, heated seats, double window chrome wheels.

      "expert_review": "Ivory soap and the Lincoln Continental. Both float.\n\nThose looking for a soft, highly cushioned ride will want to check out the’97 Continental. The price you pay, of course, is soft, cushy handling andwide roundhouse turns and corners, but if pampering is more important thanperformance, Continental delivers.\n\nContinental offers three suspensions (firm, normal and plush) and threesteering settings (high-, normal- and low-effort).\n\nThe differences in road holding and comfort levels among suspensionsettings probably will seem imperceptible to most motorists.\n\nThe big difference in steering comes when you opt for low effort, thechoice for those with muscles of mush. Ever watch those old movies in whichthe driver is moving the wheel wildly side to side while talking to hisfront-seat companion? Move the wheel that much with Continental’s low-effortsteering setting and you’ll swing from culvert to culvert across six lanes oftraffic.\n\nIf you drive aggressively and still have nerve endings in your body, setthe suspension on firm, steering on high effort and never touch them again. Ifyour hair is gray and teeth are bought, go “plush” and “low.”\n\nContinental is blessed with a host of standard safety features– dual airbags, four-wheel ABS and traction control. And it offers special options–RESCU and SecuriTires.\n\nRESCU is akin to General Motors’ OnStar in that it employs your car phoneand global positioning satellites to send for help and ensure the rescuers(from tow truck to ambulance) can pinpoint your location when dispatched.\n\nThe Michelin SecuriTires can run without pressure–zilch–for 50 miles.\n\nRESCU runs $2,750 with a voice-activated cellular phone, along with a FordJBL sound system and a garage-door opener. The SecuriTires are part of a $925personal security package with a tire-pressure warning system.\n\nSome might not consider it a safety system, but the 4.6-liter, 260-h.p.,32-valve V-8 powering Continental can get you out of tight spots in a hurry.It’s nice to have under the hood.\n\nContinental starts at $37,280. RESCU and SecuriTires put the sticker over$40,000. Other than a $595 compact-disc player, you don’t need to add anythingelse.\n\nThis fall, for the 1998 model year, Continental gets an extensive facelift,including new grille, facia, hood, fenders and headlamps /taillamps, decklidand rear bumper (as does the Lincoln Town Car, but not the Mark VIII), a yearahead of the launch of the baby Lincoln, an entry-level sedan being developedwith Jaguar, which also gets a version for 1999.\n\nThe new Lincoln will compete against the Cadillac Catera.",

      "expert_review": "Lincoln-Mercury chose to bring out the 1994 Continental in June, several months ahead of the normal fall introduction date.\n\nThe reason, some folks at Lincoln-Mercury say, is that when selected media representatives were given a sneak peek at the car at the New York Auto Show in April, they did cartwheels and somersaults over the machine.\n\nTo hear the Ford folks describe the enthusiasm for the car, you had to suspect the ’94 Continental almost had to be wrapped up and hidden from reporters to keep them from drooling all over the base coat/clear coat before paying customers had a chance to view it.\n\nIf any of you have seen the news media perform cartwheels and somersaults and then drool, you know it isn’t a pretty sight. Usually, however, it’s not anew car that prompts such reaction-typically, it is some guy at the bar hollering, “The drinks are on me.”\n\nBecause the folks from Ford have been known on occasion to get a bit carried away in trying to describe reaction to one of their new cars, we optedto test-drive a ’94 Continental on our own-but not before putting on a bib.\n\nTo be honest, the spirit may be willing, but the bones have prohibited us from performing a somersault or cartwheel for a few decades. Drool we can do, but that other rigorous physical activity is a no-no.\n\nThe Continental is a nice car, but the differences between the 1993 and ’94models fall into the “very modest” category-a new grille and taillamps and bodyside moldings. That’s about it. Yet the base price went up $505.\n\nYou see, the real reason Lincoln-Mercury brought out the car early and why some are trying to promote the car as a crowd pleaser is that an all-new Cadillac DeVille comes out this fall for the 1994 model year. To beat Cadillacto market with its luxury sedan, Lincoln-Mercury threw a new grille and headlamp treatment on the ’93 Continental and passed it off as an extensive redesign.\n\nYou have to wonder what Lincoln-Mercury will do in 1995, when a real, honest-to-goodness sheet-metal remake of the Continental will appear, along with a version of Ford’s 32-valve, 4.6-liter V-8 under the hood. Ford wasted the cartwheel and somersault routine on a different grille. What can it possibly come up with when the entire car changes?\n\nAnd if consumers have to pay $505 more for a new grille and taillamps, whatwill Ford charge when the entire car is redone?\n\nAnyway, the ’94 Continental is a roomy, comfortable, luxurious machine withabout every feature imaginable as standard, starting with the important ones-dual air bags and anti-lock brakes-and moving down to the novel ones-a mini pull-down sun visor directly above the rearview mirror to guard against glare the regular visors might let through.\n\nThere are a couple other new features, too, such as rebound springs that improve ride by eliminating lift during acceleration and dive during hard braking. There’s also a new remote seat feature t hat’s standard in the Signature Series and optional on the Executive Series. With it, when you pressthe button on the key fob to unlock the doors, the memory seat adjusts to the driver’s preferred setting. The adjustment can be programmed for each driver’skey fob.\n\nThe 3.8-liter V-6 engine is quiet and provides adequate performance. The EPA rating is 18 m.p.g. city/26 highway. A digital fuel gauge informs you how many gallons are left in the tank.\n\nRide leans toward soft and cushy but not sloppy. Computer-controlled air suspension with adaptive ride control keeps the car body level when the road surface isn’t or when you load the trunk with two weeks’ worth of vacation luggage. There also are front and rear stabilizer bars. Handling is good, thanks in large part to speed-sensitive power steering, which eliminates any weighty feel in the wheel.\n\nBut we expect Ford will have had sufficient time by 1995 to analyze the suspension on the Cadillac Seville STS to co me up with an even more aggressive, road-hugging sports suspension for the Continental.\n\nThe base price of the Executive Series Continental we drove is $33,850; theSignature Series’ base price is $35,750.\n\nStandard equipment includes power, four-wheel disc brakes; tinted glass; power, heated mirrors; rear-window defroster; intermittent windshield wipers; tilt steering; cruise control; power windows and door locks; inside deck-lid and fuel-filler door releases; AM/FM stereo with cassette and automatic power antenna; leather-wrapped steering wheel; power driver’s seat; and front floor mats.\n\nOur test car added a compact-disc player at $617, upgraded JBL audio systemat $576, power moonroof at a very hefty $1,550, alarm at $295 and leather seats at $914. There also was a preferred-equipment package at $1,023 that included keyless, illuminated entry system as well as a comfort and convenience group consisting of power, tilt passenger’s seat; dual, illuminated, visor vanity mirrors; automatic headlamp on/off; power deck-lid pull-down; and rear floor mats.\n\nThe sticker swelled to $38,825, and a $625 freight charge brought it to $39,450. An option-package savings discount of $1,023 erased the preferred-equipment package cost and brought the total to $38,427.",

      "expert_review": "The Continental, which resurrects a Lincoln nameplate not seen since 2002, comes with front- or all-wheel drive in four trim levels (Premiere, Select, Reserve and Black Label), with three available engines. Compare everything here. We drove a Select with the base engine and a Reserve with the top engine, both with all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIf the Continental signals the next chapter of Lincoln design, Ford’s tiny luxury brand could chart serious growth. Gone is the veined, split grille that characterizes most of Lincoln’s lineup. Instead, the Continental wears a bold horizontal unit that’s as much a statement for Lincoln as it is a rejection of the industry’s obsession with gaping, pavement-to-hood grilles.\n\nLikewise, the Lincoln Continental doesn’t adopt the rising beltlines of most sedans. Rather, Lincoln’s flagship embodies a fresh, horizontal aesthetic from the lights to the profile. It all descends a bit in back, and some may find the tail too droopy, but at least it’s different. Bravo, Lincoln. This is the brand’s best-looking sedan since the early-2000s LS.\n\nOh, and it’s big. Similar money buys a traditional mid-size luxury sedan — think BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Lexus GS — all of which the Continental dwarfs. At 201.4 inches long, it falls closer to those brands’ full-size sedans. That’s all too apparent in the Lincoln Continental’s turning circle, which ranges a great deal depending on driveline and wheel size. It can be as tidy as 35.4 feet or as boatlike as about 42 feet, by Lincoln’s estimate. Make sure to test yours before buying.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe all-new Lincoln Continental’s standard powertrain, a 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6, revs smoothly and offers spirited off-the-line power in the transmission’s Sport mode, which quickens accelerator response and delays upshifts. (All engines use a six-speed automatic.) Two turbocharged V-6 engines are optional: a 2.7-liter EcoBoost with 335 hp and a 3.0-liter with 400 hp. We drove the latter, whose superfluous power gets intoxicating. By 2,000 rpm or so, a sustained right foot has the sedan hurtling forward with an urgency that rivals many sports cars. The six-speed automatic — free of the extra gears that thwart so many “advanced” transmissions — dispenses smooth upshifts and deft kickdowns, though one editor noted some hard shifts at low speeds. Forget the V-8; the next Ford Mustang GT should get this engine.\n\nGet the Continental up to speed — it shouldn’t take long — and it becomes a well-tempered cruiser. The standard adaptive suspension produces reverberation-free isolation, though I observed some floatiness over broken pavement in its comfort-oriented setting. A sportier drivetrain mode — which also affects the suspension — diminishes the float and firms things up noticeably, though it remains comfort-oriented overall.\n\nModest body roll and sloppy steering turn-in will keep you from attacking fun back roads, but the Continental holds its own in a pinch. Past the first few degrees, the steering wheel sharpens up to deliver lively feedback and quick directional adjustments. The chassis shows no signs of early understeer, and Lincoln’s AWD maintains a degree of neutrality that reminded one editor of Acura’s excellent Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive.\n\nEPA-estimated combined gas mileage ranges from 19 to 21 mpg, depending on drivetrain. That’s thirstier than many competitors, but the Continental makes up some ground by recommending, not requiring, premium gas. Lincoln says premium will maximize performance, but the cheap stuff is acceptable. Given the increasing upcharge on premium in recent years, that’s an important distinction versus the luxury cars that require it.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Lincoln Continental’s profile results in squat windows all around that sacrifice some visibility, which may have you wishing for taller glass. But the interior is an otherwise inviting place. Cabin materials are excellent, with upscale graining and soft-touch surfaces virtually everywhere — a consistency you don’t always find, even at this price. Premium details abound, from chrome-ringed buttons to genuine leather-wrapped sections of the upper dashboard and doors. Even the steering wheel hub (not just the rim) comes draped in leather, and it looks stunning. From economy cars to luxury models, dashboard stitching is everywhere these days. Real cowhide is still a treat, and the Continental serves up plenty.\n\nThe base (Premiere) trim level has heated vinyl seats; higher trims get heated and ventilated seats with Lincoln’s plush Bridge of Weir leather. Some may find the standard 10-way power seats too short on cushion length, but optional 24- and 30-way (yes, 30) leather seats rectify this. Our Reserve test car had the latter. We counted only 28 adjustments, something Lincoln reconciled via interesting accounting, but the 30-way chairs are still mighty comfortable, with integrated massagers to boot.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Lincoln Continental has a standard 8-inch touchscreen with Sync 3, an intuitive multimedia platform shared with Ford. It’s a cinch to use and sits above an intuitive spread of physical buttons, with raised switches for the climate controls and must-have knobs for volume and tuning. Lincoln has thankfully thrown its disastrous MyLincoln Touch multimedia system and touch-sensitive controls into the landfill of automotive history, but in cars like the MKC and MKX, the replacement controls seem like an eleventh-hour design change. The Continental’s buttons appear conceived from the ground up; they’re functional and elegant — a high point in the cabin.\n\nSatellite radio and Android Auto are standard. Apple CarPlay, a navigation system, HD radio and two Revel premium audio systems of ascending complexity are optional. We spent the most time with the top, Revel, stereo, and editors agreed it sounds first-rate.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nFor reasons that still flummox me, in-cabin storage often takes a backseat in luxury cars. Not so with the Lincoln Continental, which stocks the center console with cubbies aplenty. Trunk volume, too, is a decent 16.7 cubic feet, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat with a small center pass-through — a rarity in big luxury cars — is standard. A power trunk lid is optional.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Continental has not been crash-tested by the IIHS. A backup camera with front and rear parking sensors is standard, but forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is unavailable on the Premiere trim level; it’s just optional on higher trims, though many rivals offer it standard — as do cars as plebian as the Toyota flippin’ Yaris. It’s an important crash-avoidance feature, and Lincoln needs to make it standard.\n\nFull-speed adaptive cruise control, 360-degree cameras, inflatable rear seat belts and auto-steering parking are also optional. So are blind spot, lane keep and lane departure warning systems, the latter with corrective steering assist.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nA front-drive Lincoln Continental Premiere comes reasonably equipped for a base price of around $45,500, while a decked-out Black Label with everything from a custom-leather interior to power rear seats tops out at more than $80,000. With that sort of range, the Lincoln Continental could appeal to everyone from luxury-value shoppers to the flagship-sedan crowd.\n\nLincoln doesn’t appear to skimp on features and materials at the low end, which speaks volumes to the Continental’s potential relevance for luxury shoppers of all stripes. But the fact that it can hold a candle — and a bright, shining one at that — to the reigning luxury flagships is most impressive. This is a big step forward for Lincoln.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lincoln Continental?\n\nThe Lincoln Continental is a large luxury sedan that seats up to five. It’s powered by a standard 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Two turbocharged V-6s, one rated at 335 hp and the other 400 hp, are available. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and the Continental competes with the Acura RLX and Volvo S90. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lincoln Continental?\n\nThe Lincoln Co-Pilot360 safety system now includes automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high-beam headlights. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lincoln Continental Are Most Important?\n\nFor the second year in a row and in a nod to the past, Lincoln offers a Coach Door Edition of the Continental with rear-hinged rear side doors. Meanwhile, the regular Continental with traditional doors comes standard with wood interior trim, a leather-wrapped power-adjustable steering wheel, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, remote start, push-button gear selection, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system and heated front seats. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lincoln Continental?\n\nMany luxury SUVs have more interior space and cargo room, and many other luxury sedans have quicker reflexes and more potent engines than even the Continental’s 400-hp V-6. Where the Continental makes its mark is with its classic styling and interior opulence.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Acura RLX, Audi A8L, Cadillac CT6, Lexus LS\n\nLooks like: A stretched Lincoln Continental\n\nDrivetrain: 400 horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6; six-speed automatic transmission; standard torque-vectoring all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealers: June 2019\n\nEighty years ago, the first Lincoln Continental came into existence, an exquisite coupe made by Ford Motor Co. to be a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, the son of company founder Henry Ford. It was its own brand, a car built to be special enough to challenge the likes of the world’s top luxury marques like Rolls-Royce — and it was priced commensurately.\n\nYears later, in 1961, the Continental nameplate was affixed to a gorgeous Lincoln sedan that had a unique feature: center-opening “suicide” rear doors to better allow for classy ingress and egress from the rear seat, especially for ladies in skirts and dresses. Fast forward to 2019, and Lincoln is celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate by bringing back the suicide doors for a limited edition.\n\nRelated: How Do Car Seats Fit in a 2018 Lincoln Continental?\n\nThe 2019 Lincoln Continental 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition features some custom bodywork and will be built in very limited numbers, but nostalgia fans are going to go nuts for this one.\n\n2019 Lincoln Continental | Manufacturer images\nExterior\n\nBy looking at it, the most obvious change for this special edition is the 6-inch stretch to the wheelbase, all of it coming in the rear passenger compartment. The roof, rear doors and rear windows are longer, and the greenhouse has a decidedly more formal, squarish look to it. A third-party outfit, Cabot Coach Builders of Massachusetts — a company that makes its living crafting limousines out of Lincolns and Cadillacs, and luxury buses out of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Ford Transit vans — handles the stretch and interior conversion.\n\nFinished Lincoln Continental Black Labels will be shipped from Lincoln’s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., to Cabot for conversion into the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition. There, they’ll have 6 inches sectioned into the rear, and the most dramatic conversion will also be performed: Rear-hinged doors will be fitted. But this isn’t just some chop-shop special — Lincoln is providing a bunch of specially engineered parts for the conversion as well, from rear door panels to interior trim, to give it a factory quality look.\n\n2019 Lincoln Continental | Manufacturer images\n\nThe new rear doors will have the same kind of e-latching system as the regular Continental, but they now will swing open 90 degrees from the rear. Until now, the only new vehicles you could get rear-hinged doors on were extended-cab pickup trucks and Rolls-Royces. The Lincoln Continental Coach Door will allow the backseat passengers to open the doors independently of the fronts, unlike most pickups, but there won’t be an electronic open-and-close assist like those found on a Rolls-Royce Wraith.\n\nRelated: Lincoln Effortless Services: 5 Perks That Could Be Worth an Owner’s Effort\n\nInterior\n\nThe only spec for the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition will be Black Label trim, giving buyers a choice of two interior colors: the light-colored Chalet interior or the black-and-saddle Thoroughbred theme. Being a Black Label means the Coach Door Edition will be fully loaded, including the 30-way adjustable seats, active noise control, a Revel premium audio system and more.\n\n2019 Lincoln Continental | Manufacturer images\n\nSpecial door-sill plates will be affixed to the rear, and a custom plaque will also be fitted to the interior to the owner’s specs. The cars will also be numbered — as Lincoln only plans to make 80 of these anniversary editions. Fewer than 100 examples will be built for the public of the 2019 model, although Lincoln says it plans to continue the Coach Door Edition for 2020, just not in the 80th Anniversary spec.\n\nThe backseat is the place to be in the new Coach Door Edition, however. The 6-inch stretch gives the Continental the most rear legroom in its class, and a new flow-through center console adds to the tray tables and wireless charging that help luxe up the accommodations.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPowering the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition will be the top engine available in the Continental: a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 400 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard six-speed automatic transmission and sends power to all four wheels via a standard torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system. Three driver-selectable modes are available (Normal, Sport and Comfort) to tailor the behavior of the Continental to the conditions, but we foresee Comfort mode likely being the most employed here.\n\n2019 Lincoln Continental | Manufacturer images\nBetter Act Fast\n\nAs stated before, only 80 of these 2019 80th Anniversary Coach Door Editions will be built, at the rate of about five a week with deliveries starting in June 2019, according to Lincoln. The price will be “north of $100,000” according to one Lincoln executive on-hand at the car’s early unveiling at the company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., last week.\n\nIt will be displayed to the public for the first time at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit next month — but if you want one, you had better get on the phone to your local Lincoln dealer right now, because Lincoln has opened up ordering immediately and they’re sure to sell out fast.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
