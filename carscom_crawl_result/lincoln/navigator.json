      "expert_review": "The ’70s are back.\n\nAnd not just in pop culture.\n\nTake a look at what boomers are driving these days. The generation raised on imports that sipped fuel, who swore they’d never drive the two-ton station wagons that gobble fuel, are now driving two-ton four-wheel-drive wagons that gobble fuel.\n\nSo much for not becoming your parents.\n\nOh sure, today’s sport utility vehicles don’t have fake wood-grain siding. Instead, they sport lots of cladding, chrome and running boards (ask your grandparents about this new idea.)\n\nOf course, after cruising in the cushy Lincoln Navigator, you can see why Baby Boomers are embracing these leviathans. It’s for the same reason their parents bought wagons with names like the Royal Colony Park Kingswood Estate Cruisemaster Brougham.\n\nThey’re comfy, powerful and can hold lots of stuff.\n\nThe Navigator is Lincoln’s attempt at doing what Lexus did with its LX450 (basically, a gussied-up Toyota Land Cruiser). They took the freshly minted Ford Expedition and sent it out to a health spa. The result is the luxurious Lincoln Navigator, a bizarre mutation of luxury in a field of “luxury” trucks as bizarre as any ’50s tail-finned creation. This is not to say Navigator’s ugly — quite the opposite. It’s quite elegant for a two-ton 4×4, Arnold in a tuxedo. It’s very ’90s, as tail fins are very ’50s.\n\nBut rather than say fun, this vehicle and others of its ilk bespeak the paranoia that infiltrates the ’90s. First, the Lincoln comes with a ground clearance only slightly lower than the tree house you had as a kid. The load-leveling suspension lowers an inch when the ignition is switched off to aid getting out. The doors lock automatically when shifting into drive to keep unwanted intruders out.\n\nThe optional shift-on-the-fly4x4 drivetrain, dubbed “Control Trac,” has four modes: rear-drive, automatic all-wheel drive, four-wheel-drive high and 4-wheel drive low to help the paranoid get through the awful winter weather that our parents battled with a rear-drive car and bags of sand in the trunk.\n\nOf course, the invincible feeling of being perched on high and a 4WD drivetrain doesn’t prevent you from accidents. So Lincoln thoughtfully provides airbags, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and an anti-theft system.\n\nOnce your nerves are soothed, you can start up the 5.4-litre single-overhead-cam V8. With 230 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque, this sophisticated power plant will move you forward and the gas gauge backwards. (According to the EPA, it depletes the world’s oil supply at a rate of 13 mpg city,17 mpg highway. Test mileage was a horrific 13.5.) Only your parents Kingswood Estate wagon was thirstier.\n\nBut this is a serious truck, probably more truck than most owners will ever use. The maximum tow-rating is 8,000 pounds with the 4×2 set-up, 7,700 with the 4×4. There are even tow hooks up front, although it would take an awfully BIG vehicle to p ull this truck out of the bog.\n\nThe handling is quiet and smooth for a big 4×4, but not as cushy as your parents gas hog. But this one doesn’t bound and dip like their vehicle, either. The steering is light but accurate, making Navigator easier to handle than its size suggests. But don’t expect much road feel.\n\nThe interior is worthy of the gargantuan Lincoln grille that it wears up front. With a special sound insulation package and18-ounce carpet, this is a quiet way to carry yourself to your destination. The instrument panel contains complete instrumentation, including battery and oil pressure gauges. In addition to the plethora of cup-holders, there’s an extra power point up front.\n\nUnlike lesser trucks in the Ford family, there’s a small tree’s worth of wood decorating the dash and the awesome Jaguar-like steering wheel. Also decorating the steering wheel are cruise control buttons, and duplicate controls for the audio system and climate control, both a far r ach for most people. Of course, a small herd of cattle were slaughtered to make some mighty comfortable seats. They have good support over long trips.\n\nThe middle row features two captains chairs separated by a console with cupholders and lots of storage. Stepping to the rear seat (literally, since there are two small steps up) gives rear passengers a theater-like view, although head-room is tight.\n\nIf all this isn’t enough to satisfy your hedonistic cravings, try out the full complement of luxury gear that’s typical for this class, like automatic climate control, 290-watt audio system with 6-CD changer, power everything, auto-dimming rearview mirror, memory seats and power sunroof among the optional goodies. What this Lincoln lacks may surprise you: There’s no heated-seat option, odd for a vehicle meant for colder climes. There’s also no separate temperature control for the front seat passenger, a common option these days in the luxury wars.\n\nWith 30,000 Navigators ready to navigate the nation’s highways, Lincoln is selling everyone it can produce — this is the hot truck to have. But I wonder, if the weather is so bad that you need one, maybe you shouldn’t go out at all.\n\nBut that’s my parents talking.\n\n1998 LINCOLN NAVIGATOR 4X4 Standard: 5.4-liter single-overhead-cam V8 engine, 4-speed electronic automatic transmission, power speed sensitive steering, power 4-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock, second row leather bucket seats, fog lamps, luggage rack, tow hooks, trailer towing package, color-keyed power heated mirrors, intermittent rear wiper, premium AM/FM/cassette stereo system, cast aluminum wheels, P245/ 75R16 tires, load leveling suspension, 3.73 axle ratio, dual airbags, automatic climate control, automatic headlamps, front and center row console, 8 cupholders, floor mats, keyless entry, memory seating, cruise control, illuminated visor vanity mirrors. Options: Skid plate package, auxiliary climate controls, electrochromatic rearview mirror, 6-CD changer, 290-watt audio system. Lincoln Navigator 4×4 for 1988 comes with all the luxury features one could imagine. Base price: $42,660 As tested: $45,170",

      "expert_review": "It’s Saturday morning at the hardware store and I feel like all the other\n\nsuburbanites because I’m driving a full-size SUV: a Lincoln Navigator.\n\nAfter buying four bags of mulch and two bags of potting soil, I flip up the rear tailgate only to find that the third seat takes up nearly all the cargo space.\n\nI fold the top of the seat forward, cover it with an old bedspread and pile in the bags of mulch.\n\nYou’d think a vehicle derived from Ford’s full-size F-150 pickup truck would have lots of hauling space, but the seven-passenger Navigator is a compromise. It can haul people or things, but not a lot of each at the same time.\n\nNow, it’s true, I could have planned ahead and left the third seat at home in the garage, which is what most folks probably do unless they haul lots of people on a regular basis. It’s too bad the third seat doesn’t fold into the floor, like in the Dodge Durango.\n\nOther than my mulch-toting experience, the Navigator did whatever I asked of it during my weeklong test drive. It is among the plushest of SUVs, with yards of leather upholstery, genuine wood accents, a cushy ride and 300 horsepower.\n\nThree optional items are new for 2000: an in-dash navigation\n\nsystem, climate-controlled seats that are cooled as well as heated and the reverse parking aid. The first two items will be available late in the model year, and our test vehicle did not have them. It did have the parking sensors, which are handy not only for parking but for warning you if a child, pet or tricycle is in your path before you back up.\n\nJust because the Navigator has the serenity of a Town Car doesn’t mean it can’t do serious work, because it can. In fact, it would be great for towing large boats or horse trailers.\n\nThe muscular, 5.4-liter DOHC V8 cranks out 300 horsepower and 355 ft.lbs. of torque. Maximum torque, or pulling power, comes at 3,000 rpm, which means it pulls heavy loads or climbs big hills without requiring the throttle to be mashed to the floor. Since it has dual overhead cams, this engine is as quiet and smooth as you would expect in a luxury car. The downside, however, is that it has a sizable thirst, but so do the other full-size SUVs in this segment.\n\nOur test vehicle was a rear-wheel drive (4X2) version because it came from Lincoln’s test fleet in Texas. For climates with mild winters, two-wheel drive is adequate on all but the most inclement of days. The 4X2 sits lower, and seems to ride softer, than the 4X4.\n\nAlthough it looks gigantic, the Navigator is easy to drive. The steering is light, almost too much so, and all the controls are power-assisted and easy to reach. The wood-rimmed steering wheel has redundant fingertip controls for the stereo and climate control, which is handier than reaching across the dash to change radio stations.\n\nThe standard seating arrangement consists of four bucket seats, a large center console between the second-row bucke ts and a folding third seat. For more cargo capacity, a fold-down second seat is optional.\n\nGetting into the third seat is not easy, especially for adults, and once there they will feel cramped. This space is best left to small and agile children.\n\nAdjustable pedals, an option, enable shorter drivers to get comfortable without having to be on top of the steering wheel, which can be dangerous in an accident.\n\nConvenience items are abundant:\n\nAn overhead console houses bins for sunglasses, garage-door openers, map lights and the readout for the trip computer.\n\nThe side running boards have lights that come on when the doors are unlocked or opened at night.\n\nThere are numerous grab handles throughout the vehicle to assist in entry and exit.\n\nThe six-disc CD changer is mounted in the center console where it is easy to reach rather than being somewhere in the back.\n\nThe Navigator is like Paul Bunyan in a tuxedo: big d brawny, yet fancy enough to take to the opera. Just remember to take out the back seat if you want to haul mulch.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test vehicle had a base price of $42,110. Options included the reverse parking aid, chrome wheels, Alpine audio system with six-disc CD changer and a 3.73 rear axle.\n\nThe sticker price was $45,485.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail:\n\nstrongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The Navigator is all about luxury. It rides softly, the engine is smooth and it is loaded with standard equipment. For those who want the ultimate, a navigation system and seats that are both heated and cooled are available.\n\nCounterpoint: The engine is pretty thirsty and the fold-down rear seat takes up valuable cargo space.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter, V8\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase:119 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,393 lbs.\n\nBase price: $42,110\n\nPrice as driven: $45,485\n\nMpg rating: 12 city, 17 city",

      "expert_review": "Five years ago, I thought it was a stupid idea.\n\nToday, I still don’t understand it.\n\nCall me wrong and call me baffled.\n\nTruck-based luxury vehicles are approaching 100,000 sales annually. We’re not talking your basic Explorers, Yukons, Denalis, Expeditions, and Sequoias here.\n\nWe’re talking Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac, Lincoln – at prices starting around $50,000 and doubling or more as you climb the luxury SUV ladder.\n\nI see them everywhere. I have read that any parking lot that secures the vehicles of professional athletes is chockablock with them. I have just driven one of the latest.\n\nI still don’t understand it.\n\nNot that there is anything inherently wrong with the 2002 Lincoln Navigator from which I just climbed down.\n\nLuxurious, powerful, roomy, it is all that.\n\nYet consider its lineage, not unlike that of other huge SUVs: the Ford F-Body pickup truck begat the Ford Expedition, begat the Navigator. Meanwhile General Motors was doing some begatting of its own with the truck-based Yukon Denali becoming a Cadillac Escalade. And both the Navigator and the Escalade were only stops amidst all this begatting as the Navigator gave us the Lincoln Blackwood and the Escalade produced the Escalade EXT, both luxurious pickups for hauling mink and diamonds around the back 40,000 on the Texas ranch.\n\nSo here we are with the 2002 Lincoln Navigator, knowing that it sits in the midst of a remake for the 2003 model year.\n\nFor all its luxury, power, and elegance, it’s still very much a truck, its suspension lagging behind the times, its lack of traction and stability control systems a noticeable omission. Not that both of these faults won’t be addressed for 2003.\n\nIt is distinctly Lincoln and distinctly elegant on the outside, with a slick wraparound bumper pierced by fog lamps and a sculpted hood that appears to be devouring the headlights. Integrated running boards, lit at night, and rounded body and roof convey power and sleekness at the same time, quite a feat in a hulk of a vehicle.\n\nPower comes from a 5.4-liter V-8 with four valves per cylinder. It produces 300 horsepower and 355 lb.-ft. of torque at an impressively low 2,750 rpms. That would push your plow. (Right!)\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission is so smooth as to be nearly unnoticeable as it shifts up and down in keeping nearly three tons of vehicle moving smoothly.\n\nOn the road, the body roll that is being weaned out of high-riding, top-heavy SUVs remains noticeable. Front and rear suspension includes control arms and coil springs over shock absorbers. It’s too soft a setup for this vehicle and while that meant smooth, silent gliding down the highway at commuter speeds, lane changes had to be made with special care and on back roads, a pronounced slowing down was necessary on sharp corners.\n\nOf course, careful lane changes and slow, sure cornering ought to be the order of the day in any SUV.\n\nThe Navigator comes in either 2- or 4-wheel-drive (as tested) and the 4-wheel options include automatic 4WD, which splits torque equally front to rear, 4 High, which locks front and rear drive shafts together, and 4 Low, which does the same and also reduces gearing for low-speed offroad driving.\n\nNot many Navigators will ever do this last feat, yet I found it impressive one icy morning in the mountains of New Hampshire. Parked diagonally outside a ski house, with the driveway sloping sharply and coated with ice, I backed it out of its space, stopped, and then had to contend with a vehicle that started sliding sideways down the slope. I put it in low-range, into reverse, backed it into a snowbank, then crawled carefully out to get the front end headed downhill.\n\nInside, the Navigator has huge functional space. Broad leather bucket seats in the front run nearly flat to their edges (I’d prefer higher bolsters out there), and they feature multiple adjustments, a nice power lumbar adjustment, and climate controls f either heating them or air-conditioning through a hole in the seat bottom.\n\nThe dash features an easily accessible pod with easy to use controls (big knobs, big buttons) with audio up top and climate below. Only the fan control, a spinning wheel, was awkward and imprecise.\n\nThe middle row of seats was split 60-40 to allow for easy access to the rear, and the third row bench tipped up for storage, though it required the use of an awkward brace to keep it propped away.\n\nSix people travel in absolute spaciousness, and eight can travel in fine comfort in the Navigator. Climate controls front and rear allow for individual tastes and ducts in the headliners above the second and third row seats add to this amenity.\n\nWith all the luxury that comes standard – wood, leather, auto-dimming rearview mirror – I found it a bit much that a navigation system that really wasn’t all that detailed would run an extra $1,995 and a power sunroof would add another $1,500. If you’re selling luxury and convenience, just build it in.\n\nI’m looking forward to the 2003 model, whose suspension will be remade for better handling and will automatically lower the car when the key is turned off (easier egress), and whose running boards will be wider. An interesting option for those running boards will be a system that raises and folds away the boards while traveling and unfolds them when the car is turned off. It will also feature a fold-flat rear seat that disappears into the floor, eliminating that weird brace.\n\nBut perhaps of greatest importance – for safety and handling – is that the rear half-axles will be routed through the frame, lowering the center of gravity, as was done with the redesigned Ford Explorer.\n\n2002 Lincoln Navigator\n\nBase price: $47,965\n\nPrice as tested: $54,175\n\nHorsepower: 300\n\nTorque: 355 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 119.1 inches\n\nOverall length: 204.8 inches\n\nWidth: 79.9 inches\n\nHeight: 76.7 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,774 lbs.\n\nSeating: 8 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 14.1 miles per gallon\n\nSOURCE: Ford Motor Co.-Lincoln Division; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch\n\nThe huge grab handles at each door. Great for pulling yourself up and into this rig.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nI appreciate seat belt warning signals, but please, don’t set them off until the car goes into gear. On cold mornings it’s nice to start the car and let it idle to warm up, even as you might want to fiddle around inside the car, or make a cellphone call or two. Loud dinging in an idling auto is annoying.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Lincoln Navigator a Good Luxury SUV?\n\nWith excellent interior materials, a stunning 48-inch digital dashtop display, undeniable road presence and a selection of interior themes, the updated 2025 Lincoln Navigator is one of the best options in the luxury full-size SUV class.\n\nHow Does the Lincoln Navigator Compare With Other Luxury SUVs?\n\nThe Navigator’s biggest competition comes from the Cadillac Escalade, and though the Navigator is more expensive to start, the Lincoln’s somewhat restrained design and rich standard features makes it an equal contender.\n\nThe U.S is a big country with “bigness” as a byproduct. We’ve got big spaces, big roads, a big sky, big dreams and big appetites, all of which led to the popularity of ever-so-American big luxury. No one does the full-size luxury SUV better; the large, lumbering luxo-leviathans like the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade are some of the best ways to loaf around town and country, especially when you need to haul the family and a sizable boat. Need one? Make sure your shopping list includes the significantly revised ‘n’ refreshed 2025 Lincoln Navigator.\n\nRelated: Ultra-Luxe 2025 Lincoln Navigator Goes Big on Screens\n\nThere’s a heap of stylistic and technology updates, but pricing sees the biggest change for 2025 with the cheapest Navigator sliding in at $101,990 (prices include destination), or nearly $17,000 more than the prior model. Much of this boils down to a trim reorganization, with the discontinuation of the base Premiere trim leaving the mid-grade Reserve as the new point of entry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nOther than additional standard finery, look for new, uh, everything else. A new grille incorporates an available vehicle-wide LED light bar and illuminated Lincoln badge that lends serious valet-lot cred, as do the standard 22-inch wheels (24-inch rims are available). The new liftgate is the most significant exterior revision, now incorporating a handy-dandy split-gate function that offers tailgate functionality for its bottom third. A clever multipurpose cargo divider is also available, tripling as a cargo cover, parcel shelf and tailgate seatback should you desire to watch Junior’s little league game from the parking lot.\n\nBig bruisers of this caliber are hardly the most elegant sleds on the road, but Lincoln’s soft-edged refinement conveys moderate restraint compared with some of the blingiest Escalades — especially if you opt for the available Jet Appearance Package that darkens exterior chrome bits for minimum flash. Muted, mature colors have become a Lincoln hallmark, and I’m quite partial to the deep Flight Blue Metallic that’s available on lower-to-mid trims. If you’re seeking maximum attention at both the carpool lane and country club, step up to the range-topping Black Label trim to unlock the gleaming Sunrise Copper Metallic Pearlcoat paint, a livery that hits critical levels of nouveau riche when combined with the available black exterior trim.\n\n2025 Lincoln Navigator | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Nice Is the 2025 Lincoln Navigator’s Interior?\n\nThe interior undergoes the same cosmetic overhaul, a change that had me a bit more apprehensive than excited. The prior Black Label Navigator was, without pretense, one of the most luxurious cockpits available regardless of price, with great materials, fabulously curated colorways and top-notch presentation. In concert, the Black Label was not too far off from how a hypothetical full-size Bentley SUV would present.\n\nThe new Black Label is no less luxurious, only less intriguing to behold and interact with. Much of the physical controls are now digitized, accessed via the lower 11.1-inch touchscreen that plays a functional second fiddle to the sprawling 48-inch “coast-to-coast” dashtop display previously enjoyed on the Lincoln Nautilus mid-size SUV. This curved screen is a dramatic evolution of a standard digital driver display, with layouts for navigation, vehicle information and infotainment. It’s a visually arresting setup, one that is very much of the current era of automotive design. There’s a lot to look at, so the steering wheel was molded into a squircle — a neologism for a round-edged square — for maximum screen visibility.\n\nAt least on the Black Label that I drove, there’s no region of the cockpit that doesn’t feel properly indulgent. Extended time spent in even the second row’s heated-and-ventilated captain’s chairs should count toward some hotel loyalty programs, buoyed by the second row’s optional seatback entertainment screens and center console with beaucoup storage and wireless charging.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Lincoln Navigator Drive?\n\nAll of this, along with little touches like the faceted crystal volume knob, active cabin scents and a 30-way-adjustable driver’s seat add up to a comprehensively primo driving experience. Speaking of driving, the new Navigator doesn’t feel significantly different from the prior SUV when on the move, mostly due to a carryover platform and drivetrain. The familiar twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine is back, making 440 horsepower and 510 pounds-feet of torque, and it pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard.\n\nHow’s it drive? Big — but with a managed, confident heft not unlike an NFL linebacker cutting up on “Dancing With the Stars.” It’s far from agile, but the adaptive suspension finds a solid balance between composure and supreme cushiness, usually leaning into the latter. Bumps and pavement breaks are muffled with a silk gag and politely drowned in a vat of buttercream, and it’s all complemented by steering and braking that feels filtered through a vat of fondue fromage.\n\nAcceleration is strong for such a large barge, with 0-60 mph likely falling somewhere in the low six-second range. Good stuff when facing down an on-ramp with a full house, but better still for when there’s a trailer in tow. Manually selecting gears for towing or, God forbid, aggressive driving is a smidge tricky, with gear selection managed by two buttons on the flat portion of the center console. Manual anything is antithetical to the very ethos of the 2025 Navigator, so you’d best let all 10 of those gears manage themselves. In fact, why don’t you let the whole darn bus handle the drive? Lincoln’s BlueCruise hands-free cruise control plays the role of fussy chauffeur quite well, handling the majority of highway driving with nary a scare or sketchy moment.\n\n2025 Lincoln Navigator | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBig Timer: Redesigned 2025 Lincoln Navigator Priced From $101,990\n2025 Lincoln Navigator Up Close: New Navigator Goes Nautilus\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\nResearch Lincoln SUVs\nShop for a 2025 Lincoln Navigator Near You\nHow Much Does a 2025 Lincoln Navigator Cost?\n\nFor the most part, those interested in the 2025 Lincoln Navigator will purchase it predicated on its presence, interior appointments, towing capacity, or lease payment and not how the sucker barrels down a California canyon road. Maximum luxury, maximum price: As mentioned above, you can expect to bring your thickest, heaviest checkbook for this new Lincoln. Beyond that roughly $102,000 base Reserve trim, things spiral to somewhere north of $135,000 for a maxed-out, long-wheelbase Black Label Navigator L.\n\nHey, big luxury means big price — and I have a feeling Black Label customers wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Lincoln Navigator full-size SUV is easy to drive and provides exceptional comfort in all three rows of seats, but it needs a richer interior to truly compete in the luxury class.\n\nLincoln has significantly updated the Navigator for the 2015 model year with new styling and a new twin-turbocharged V-6 engine that replaces the previous V-8. (To see how the new Navigator specs compare with the old ones, click here.)\n\nIt’s offered in regular- and long-wheelbase L form with rear- or four-wheel drive. We tested a regular-wheelbase four-wheel-drive model with a starting price of $66,050, including a $995 destination charge. Competitors like the GMC Yukon Denali, Infiniti QX80 and Mercedes-Benz GL450 are priced similarly. (To see their specs compared, click here.) Optional features raised our Navigator’s as-tested price to $73,395.\n\nExterior & Styling\nBold grilles have defined a number of full-size luxury SUVs, the Navigator included, but the model’s 2015 face-lift dials things back a bit; the massive cheese-grater grille has been replaced with Lincoln’s new split-style design, similar to the Lincoln MKC’s styling but not as sleek. After experimenting with new front-end treatments every few years, Lincoln finally seems to have found a look that will last a while.\n\nNearly everything that can be power-operated on the Navigator is power-operated. This includes a standard power liftgate, power rear-quarter windows, power running boards and power-folding side mirrors that tuck exceptionally close to the SUV. A power moonroof is optional.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Navigator’s poise and driving refinement are among its best qualities. This is a big SUV, but it doesn’t take long to get accustomed to its size. The direct, responsive steering deserves a lot of the credit; the setup is confidence-inspiring and makes maneuvering the Navigator easy.\n\nRide quality is on the firm side. Our Navigator was fitted with optional Lincoln Drive Control adaptive shock absorbers; traditional shocks are standard. You feel bumps and dips in the road, but the suspension’s overall refinement prevents them from diminishing the driving experience. Wheels and tires can affect ride quality, and our test car had optional 22-inch wheels with low-profile tires, as opposed to the standard 20-inch wheels. Larger tires usually cost more to replace, as well.\n\nThe adaptive suspension does a great job of eliminating irritating characteristics traditionally associated with large SUVs, such as body roll, brake dive and acceleration squat. Drive the Navigator hard into a corner, and body roll is surprisingly absent. It’s a testament to how much work has gone into refining the Navigator’s driving experience.\n\nLarge V-8 engines have been a signature feature of full-size luxury SUVs for years, but that’s starting to change as automakers chase better fuel economy for their biggest vehicles. The 2015 Navigator makes the switch from a V-8 to a twin-turbo V-6 engine, but I didn’t miss the V-8 at all.\n\nRated at 380 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, the V-6 makes 70 hp and 95 pounds-feet of torque more than the old V-8. Curb weight is still around three tons for a four-wheel-drive Navigator, and acceleration feels as strong as with the prior V-8: quick enough, but not overwhelmingly powerful.\n\nThe twin-turbo V-6 gets the Navigator up to highway speeds easily, and if you need to make a quick pass there’s good reserve power. The engine makes a high-pitched hissing sound when accelerating. It’s faint, but it’s a reminder that there isn’t a regular V-8 under the hood. The V-6 is matched with a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly and is quick to kick down when you want more power.\n\nWith the new engine, the four-wheel-drive Navigator’s EPA-estimated gas mileage increases to 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, an across-the-board improvement of 2 mpg. That’s better than the 16-mpg combined rating for the four-wheel-drive QX80, but the four-wheel-drive, 420-hp Yukon Denali also gets 17 mpg combined with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The GL450, which gets a new twin-turbo V-6 for the 2015 model year, is rated 19 mpg combined.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming of driving the Navigator is its brake-pedal feel. The SUV has disc brakes at all four corners that stop it just fine, but there’s a disappointing numbness when you step on the brake pedal.\n\nInterior\nThe Navigator comes standard with three rows of seats and room for seven people — eight with a second-row split-bench seat that’s a no-cost option — and it’s one of the few full-size SUVs that can comfortably carry adults in any of its three rows.\n\nThe task of climbing up to the driver’s seat is made easier by the standard power running boards that motor down from their flush position against the side sills when you open a door. Leather upholstery is standard, and the front bucket seats provide good support. A power-adjustable steering column and powered pedals — both standard — should help both short and tall people find a comfortable driving position.\n\nOur test model had the standard second-row captain’s chairs, which are separated by a wide walk-through that makes it easy for passengers to get to the third row. The second-row chairs don’t slide forward or back, but legroom for taller adults is good and the backrest reclines far back.\n\nThird-row comfort and roominess really set the Navigator apart from the competition. Unless you’re considering an extended-wheelbase model, most third-row seats in full-size SUVs are barely big enough for kids, let alone adults. The Navigator’s third row, however, is almost as comfortable as the second-row captain’s chairs. The impressive comfort is attributable to the raised, ergonomically correct seating position, plus decent legroom and good headroom. The main drawback of the third row is the upper portion of the backrest. It’s scalloped, so the head restraints can nest there when the seat is folded, but it didn’t feel right against my shoulder blades.\n\nLincoln has refined the Navigator’s cabin for the 2015 model year. Changes include a new instrument panel with configurable screens bordering a central analog speedometer, a restyled dashboard with updated controls and the MyLincoln Touch entertainment system. Our test car had the optional Reserve Package that includes more leather trim, among other features, but while overall materials quality is good, it’s still too similar to an uplevel Ford model to be considered among the luxury elite; the Cadillac Escalade and QX80 cabins feel considerably richer.\n\nWith large side windows, visibility is good no matter which row you’re in, and forward views are good thanks to the Navigator’s elevated driving position, large windshield and thin roof pillars.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nYou can really see the dramatic about-face Lincoln has made with its interior controls by comparing those in the 2015 Navigator with the ones in the brand’s MKX crossover. Nearly all the dashboard controls in the 2015 MKX are touch-sensitive pads, and fan speed and stereo volume are controlled by touch-sensitive sliders. Futuristic? Arguably. Easy to use? Not so much.\n\nIt’s good to see this experiment has come to an end; the Navigator has familiar knobs for stereo volume and tuning, and physical buttons for everything else besides the 8-inch touch-screen that runs MyLincoln Touch.\n\nMyLincoln Touch and its sibling system, MyFord Touch, organize phone connectivity, navigation, climate control and audio functionality into quadrants on the dashboard screen. It’s also connected to the right-hand screen in the instrument panel. The setup is easy enough to use, but Chrysler’s Uconnect 8.4 system is quicker than the sometimes-sluggish MyLincoln Touch. The Uconnect screen has more vibrant colors and doesn’t require a firm punch with your finger when making a selection like MyLincoln Touch does. However, MyLincoln Touch’s voice recognition system does a good job interpreting spoken destinations, and my iPhone paired easily to the system via Bluetooth.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Navigator’s cargo area is considerably smaller than its exterior bulk suggests; with all rows of seats raised there’s just 18.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row. The Navigator isn’t alone in this regard; the Yukon Denali, QX80 and GL450 have 15.3, 16.6 and 16 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, respectively. If you need more cargo room, the Navigator L and Yukon Denali XL long-wheelbase models have 42.6 and 39.3 cubic feet, respectively, behind the third row.\n\nA power-folding 60/40-split third row is standard. It takes about 11 seconds for the seat sections to fold flat with the cargo floor or come back up for passenger use. Cargo room increases to 54.4 cubic feet with the third row folded, and with the second-row seats down the Navigator’s maximum cargo volume is 103.3 cubic feet.\n\nBesides a big center console bin under the front armrest, cabin storage provisions are minimal; the glove box and front door pockets are small.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Navigator hadn’t been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nElectronic stability systems are required in all new cars, but the Navigator’s system also measures if a rollover has begun and can apply the brakes and cut engine power to help bring the SUV back under control.\n\nA backup camera and front and rear parking sensors are standard. A blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert and trailer-sway control are also standard, but increasingly common advanced safety features like forward collision warning and lane departure warning aren’t offered.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Navigator, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Navigator’s base price includes a lot of premium features as standard equipment, but there are also some curious omissions, like the lack of an optional heated steering wheel and certain advanced safety features.\n\nWhether the Navigator offers enough will hinge on what you want in a full-size luxury SUV. If it’s good driving manners and excellent comfort across all three rows of seats, this SUV will likely be a good fit. If luxurious accommodations are more important, other models, like the QX80, might be a better match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln redesigned its full-size sport utility vehicle as an early 2003 model and moved it away from its pickup-truck origins. Changes to the Navigators chassis promise less of the trucklike ride that the previous model exhibited. The current model features a four-wheel-independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering. Like its predecessor, the 2004 Navigator is essentially a dressed-up Ford Expedition.\n\nDevelopers sought to improve interior quietness and refinement. Lincoln claimed several industry firsts with some of the Navigators features; these included the SUVs optional, powered, third-row seat that folds into the floor and its power-extendable running boards, which ease entry and exit. Rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive Navigators are offered in Luxury and Ultimate trim levels.\n\nA tire-pressure monitor is standard, and front tweeter speakers are installed. An optional AdvanceTrac electronic stability system now features Roll Stability Control. Lincoln also introduced a companion Aviator SUV for 2003.\n\nExterior\nEven though the design of the roof and front doors was carried over from the previous model, fresh bodywork elsewhere promises better aerodynamics. Lincolns signature grille consists of vertical argent vanes. Aluminum wheels hold 18-inch tires.\n\nElevating the front edge of the hood makes it possible to see the vehicles corners. For the 2003 redesign, frame rails were lowered by 2 inches, and the bumper beam was lowered by 2 inches to improve compatibility with smaller vehicles in a collision. The Navigator lowers itself by an inch when the ignition is turned off to allow easier entry and exit.\n\nHigh-intensity-discharge headlights, a power liftgate and a power moonroof are installed on the Ultimate model. The available power running boards extend outward by 4 inches when the door is opened, and they retract when the door closes.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the second-row seating configuration, the Navigator carries either seven or eight people and includes a standard 60/40-split third-row seat. Lincoln offers either a bench seat or twin buckets for the second row. A power-operated third-row seat that folds into the floor is optional.\n\nThe interior blends walnut burl with premium leather trim. A navigation system and a DVD entertainment system for the rear seats are available. Standard equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating surfaces (excluding the third-row seat), heated power mirrors, a six-CD changer and power-adjustable pedals. The Ultimate edition adds heated and cooled seats, the powered third-row seat and Lincolns AdvanceTrac electronic stability system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLincolns 5.4-liter V-8 engine develops 300 horsepower and 355 pounds-feet of torque; it mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The 4×4 model can tow as much as 8,300 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, dual-stage front airbags and a tire-pressure monitor are standard. A curtain-type Safety Canopy airbag system enhances occupant protection in side impacts and rollovers. The rear park-assist system uses ultrasonic sensors and radar.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLincolns top SUV does a fine job of keeping its tires on the pavement. The ride is pleasantly satisfying overall, and the suspension responds quickly to bumps without overreacting.\n\nHandling is reasonably refined. The Navigator performs capably on twisty two-lane roads, but its a tad unsure of itself at times. The automatic transmission reacts easily most of the time, but multiple downshifts when the gas pedal is pushed hard can be jarring. Braking is linear and effective.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLincoln redesigned its full-size sport utility vehicle for 2003, moving the Navigator away from its pickup-truck origins. Chassis modifications promised to lessen the trucklike ride that the previous model had exhibited. Lincoln claimed several industry firsts as options, including a power-folding third-row seat and power-extendable running boards, which ease entry and exit.\n\nAlthough the Navigator is essentially a dressed-up Ford Expedition, the 2005 model gained a six-speed-automatic transmission — versus the Expedition’s four-speed automatic — that promised improved smoothness when shifting. A new 5.4-liter V-8 with three valves per cylinder delivered the same 300 horsepower as before, but torque output increased. AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control became standard on all Navigators.\n\nRear- and four-wheel-drive Navigators are offered in Luxury and Ultimate trim levels. Current models feature a four-wheel-independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering. Lincoln dropped its Aviator after 2005, making the Navigator the company’s sole SUV.\n\nAn Elite Package, available on the Ultimate trim level, includes 18-inch chrome wheels, a navigation system, THX-Certified audio, high-intensity-discharge headlights, a rear-seat entertainment system, power running boards and a heavy-duty trailer-towing package.\n\nExterior\nFor 2005, Lincoln’s signature grille got a new chrome finish on the upper portion, a fresh front fascia and revised bodyside cladding. High-intensity-discharge headlights are optional. Aluminum wheels hold 18-inch tires, but chrome wheels are available. The Navigator lowers itself by an inch when the ignition is turned off.\n\nLincoln’s four-wheel-independent air suspension offers four-corner load leveling. A powered liftgate and a moonroof are installed on the Ultimate model. The available powered running boards extend outward 4 inches when a door is opened and retract when it closes.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the second-row seating configuration, the Navigator carries either seven or eight people and includes a standard 60/40-split third-row seat. Lincoln offers either a 40/20/40-split bench seat or twin buckets for the second row. A power-operated third-row seat that folds into the floor is standard in the Ultimate model, which also features heated and cooled front seats.\n\nBurl walnut and leather trim grace the Navigator’s interior. Standard equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating surfaces in the first and second rows, a six-CD changer and power-adjustable pedals. A navigation system with Soundmark THX-Certified audio and a DVD backseat entertainment system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLincoln’s latest 5.4-liter V-8 develops 300 hp and 365 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a ZF six-speed-automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive models can tow as much as 8,600 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nAdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control is standard. A Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbag system enhances protection in side impacts and rollovers for occupants in the first and second rows. All-disc antilock brakes, rear parking assist and a tire-pressure-monitoring system are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLincoln’s SUV is stylish inside and appealing in many ways, but it doesn’t feel quite as secure and surefooted at highway speeds or on twisty two-lane roads as it should.\n\nDespite the Navigator’s six-speed automatic, acceleration seems weaker compared with Expeditions that use the four-speed automatic. On the plus side, the ride is pleasantly satisfying overall, and the suspension responds quickly to bumps without overreacting. Braking is linear and effective.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Navigator is Lincoln’s full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight people in three rows. Related to the Ford Expedition, the SUV is also available in long-wheelbase Navigator L form. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX56.\n\nSkip to details on the: Navigator L\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Navigator gains a few new features for 2010. The standard electronic stability system now boasts trailer-sway control, which can sense from the movement of the SUV if a trailer may be out of control and apply the brakes or reduce engine power. The Navigator also comes standard with Ford’s MyKey system, which gives buyers the ability to set maximum speed and volume limits based on the key that’s in use — handy for parents sharing the Navigator with a teen driver. Power-lowering running boards are newly standard, too.\n\nExterior\nThe Navigator’s most prominent feature is its grille. It’s an eggcrate design with a large horizontal bar running through the Lincoln logo. Flanking the grille are standard xenon headlights.\n\nStandard capless fuel system\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard 18-inch aluminum wheels; 20-inch chrome rims optional\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe leather-upholstered heated-and-cooled front seats include power adjustments, and there are adjustable pedals to add to driver comfort. Wood accents are found throughout the cabin. Second-row captain’s chairs are standard, but a split-bench seat can be substituted at no extra charge. There’s a standard power-folding third-row seat.\n\nSeats seven or eight\nStandard Sync voice-activated multimedia system\nStandard backup camera\nStandard heated second-row bucket seats\nStandard Sirius Satellite Radio with 14-speaker audio system\nOptional backseat entertainment system with 8-inch screen\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Navigator has standard V-8 power and is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The only EPA gas mileage estimates available for the Navigator are for the two-wheel-drive model, which is rated at 14/20 mpg city/highway.\n\n310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 365 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nRuns on regular gas\n9,000-pound (RWD) or 8,700-pound (4WD) towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control\nSide-impact airbags for front-seat occupants\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nNavigator L\nThough similar in appearance to the regular Navigator, the long-wheelbase Navigator L is about 15 inches longer and provides 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space with all the seats in place — nearly 25 cubic feet more than the shorter model.\n\nLike the Navigator, the Navigator L is powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, but the Navigator L’s towing capacity of 8,700 pounds for the rear-wheel-drive model and 8,500 pounds for four-wheel-drive versions are both slightly lower than what the regular Navigator achieves.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Navigator is Lincoln’s full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight people in three rows. Related to the Ford Expedition, the SUV is also available in long-wheelbase Navigator L form. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX56.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Navigator L)\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Navigator is now offered with Sync AppLink, which allows voice control of certain smartphone applications. Also new are spotter mirrors to give the driver a better view of their blind spot.\n\nExterior\nThe Navigator’s most prominent design feature is its grille. It has an egg-crate appearance with a large horizontal bar running through the Lincoln logo. Flanking the grille are standard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard capless fuel system\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard 18-inch aluminum wheels; 20-inch chrome rims optional\nOptional moonroof\nNew integrated spotter mirrors\n\n\nInterior\nThe leather-upholstered heated-and-cooled front seats include power adjustments, and there are adjustable pedals to add to driver comfort. Wood accents are found throughout the cabin. Second-row captain’s chairs are standard, but a split-bench seat can be substituted at no extra charge. There’s a standard power-folding third-row seat.\n\nThe Navigator also comes standard with Ford’s Sync voice-operated entertainment and information system and MyKey, which gives buyers the ability to set maximum speed and volume limits based on the key that’s in use — handy for parents sharing the Navigator with a teen driver. Power-lowering running boards are standard, too. Interior features include:\n\n\nSeats seven or eight\nStandard Sync voice-activated multimedia system\nStandard backup camera\nStandard heated second-row bucket seats\nStandard satellite radio with 14-speaker stereo\nOptional backseat entertainment system with 8-inch screen\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Navigator has standard V-8 power and is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 365 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nRuns on regular gas\n9,000-pound (RWD) or 8,700-pound (4WD) towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nThe standard electronic stability system includes trailer-sway control, which can detect if a trailer is out of control and apply the brakes or reduce engine power. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control and trailer-sway control\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\n\nNavigator L\nThough similar in appearance to the regular Navigator, the long-wheelbase Navigator L is about 15 inches longer and provides 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space with all the seats in place — nearly 25 cubic feet more than the regular Navigator.\n\nLike the Navigator, the Navigator L is powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, but the Navigator L’s towing capacity of 8,700 pounds for the rear-wheel-drive model and 8,500 pounds for four-wheel-drive versions are both slightly lower than what the regular Navigator achieves.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSince a 2007 redesign, Lincoln has changed little about the Navigator. For 2009 the model sees only minor additions. The Navigator’s competitors include the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX56. A longer-wheelbase model, the Navigator L, accompanies the regular-length model.\n\n(Skip to details on the Navigator L)\n\nNew for 2009\nNew standard features include Front Park Assist, Lincoln Sync, a capless fuel system, rain-sensing wipers, heated second-row seats and rearview camera system.\n\nExterior\nThe SUV’s most prominent feature is its grille. It’s an eggcrate design with a large horizontal bar running through the Lincoln logo. The Navigator is 208.4 inches long, making it longer than both the Escalade and QX56.\n\nExterior features include:\n\nStandard capless fuel system\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard power liftgate\nMonochrome Limited Edition Package available\nAvailable power-folding running boards\n\nInterior\nIn the front, the seats are 10-way power adjustable, and adjustable pedals add to the driver’s comfort. Leather and wood accents are found throughout the cabin. Cargo space increases to 54.5 cubic feet when the standard power-folding third-row seats are flipped down. The second row also folds flat. With both rows down, the Navigator has 103.3 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nStandard Sync voice-activated system\nStandard rearview camera system and Front Park Assist\nStandard heated and cooled front seats\nStandard heated second-row seats\nStandard Sirius Satellite Radio with 14-speaker audio system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Navigator can have either rear- or four-wheel drive and is powered by a 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 engine with 365 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic is the sole transmission, and the Navigator can tow up to 9,000 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control\nSide-impact airbags for front-seat occupants\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\n\nNavigator L\nThe Navigator L is 15 inches longer than the Navigator. It’s available with the same features and options as the Navigator, but provides 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats up — nearly 25 cubic feet more than the shorter model.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the Navigator L’s maximum towing capacity is 8,700 pounds, 300 pounds less than the standard version.\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Navigator is Lincoln’s full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight people in three rows. Related to the Ford Expedition, the SUV is also available in long-wheelbase Navigator L form. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX56.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Navigator L)\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nThe Navigator’s most prominent design feature is its grille. It has an egg-crate appearance with a large horizontal bar running through the Lincoln logo. Flanking the grille are standard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard capless fuel system\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard power running boards \nStandard 18-inch aluminum wheels; 20-inch chrome rims optional\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe leather-upholstered heated-and-cooled front seats include power adjustments, and there are adjustable pedals to add to driver comfort. Wood accents are found throughout the cabin. Second-row captain’s chairs are standard, but a split-bench seat can be substituted. There’s a standard power-folding third-row seat.\n\nThe Navigator also comes standard with Ford’s Sync voice-operated entertainment and information system and MyKey, which gives buyers the ability to set maximum speed and volume limits based on the key that’s in use — handy for parents sharing the Navigator with a teen driver. Interior features include:\n\nSeats seven or eight\nStandard Sync voice-activated multimedia system\nStandard heated second-row bucket seats\nStandard satellite radio\nOptional rear entertainment system with 8-inch screen\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Navigator has standard V-8 power and is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 365 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nRuns on regular gas\n9,000-pound (RWD) or 8,700-pound (4WD) towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nThe standard electronic stability system includes trailer-sway control, which can detect if a trailer is out of control and apply the brakes or reduce engine power. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control and trailer-sway control\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBackup camera\n\nNavigator L\nThough similar in appearance to the regular Navigator, the long-wheelbase Navigator L is about 15 inches longer and provides 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space with all of the seats up — nearly 25 cubic feet more than the regular Navigator.\n\nLike the Navigator, the Navigator L is powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, but the Navigator L’s towing capacity of 8,700 pounds for the rear-wheel-drive model and 8,500 pounds for four-wheel-drive versions are both slightly lower than the regular Navigator’s.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for up to eight people; an optional second-row bench with three seats can be chosen over the standard dual captain’s chairs. A 440-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 teamed with a 10-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain. All Navigators now come with four-wheel drive; rear-wheel drive has been discontinued for 2024. Maximum towing capacity is a stout 8,700 pounds. For those who need even more Lincoln SUV in their life, there’s also an extended-length Navigator L version. Direct rivals to the Navigator include the Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV, Mercedes-Benz GLS, BMW X7 and Jeep Grand Wagoneer.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nIn addition to 4WD becoming a standard feature on all Navigators, the base Standard trim has been renamed Premiere. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nDual second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front- and second-row seats\n14-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seats \n24-way power-adjustable front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nPanoramic sunroof\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSurround-view camera system\n28-speaker Revel audio system\nBlueCruise hands-free highway driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nWith its massive prow and commanding seating position, the Navigator cuts a path through traffic wherever it ventures. It’s one of the biggest SUVs available today, and it’s priced accordingly: A fully loaded Navigator in Black Label trim soars well beyond $100,000. Many car shoppers, however, will be fine without adding every conceivable option to this amply proportioned — and already well-equipped — sport-ute. The cabin is elegantly designed, and its tech features are easy to use without needing to spend days reading the owner’s manual. If you need a vehicle of this scale, the Navigator is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2007 about the 2007 Lincoln Navigator. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLincoln didn’t redesign the new Navigator from the ground up, like Cadillac did with its latest Escalade, but it sure did a number inside and out to make it look completely different. The Navigator’s appearance could be its major selling point, because in most other ways it doesn’t stand out. The question is: How many buyers will like the looks enough to buy it, and will they like it enough to pick it over the all-new Escalade?\n\nThe Bling Factor\nThe dumbest question an automotive journalist could pose in regard to the new Lincoln Navigator would be, “What do you notice first when looking at it?” Duh! It might as well be called the Blingmobile, as my wife and I nicknamed it, thanks to its giant, diamond-cut chrome grille. Wait a second, is that chrome? Nope; chrome is very expensive these days and is rarely used on new cars and trucks. The grille is actually painted plastic, and when you get up close you can tell it isn’t substantial. It sure looks real from far away, though, and will look that way to the people and drivers you pass on the street.\n\nPersonally, I liked the old blade-like grille on the previous Navigator and thought it could have been enlarged and chromed for the 2007 version, much like the Lincoln Mark LT’s. That’s enough virtual ink devoted to the grille, I think, and at least the headlights are well-integrated into the otherwise busy design. Take a walk around the rest of the Navigator and you’ll wonder why it’s so busy up front when from every other angle the design is incredibly subtle. My black test vehicle was the perfect color, and I couldn’t really fathom anyone going for anything else — though I saw one in purple recently, and certainly that would not go unnoticed.\n\nInterior\nInside the cabin, big, plush seats welcome the driver and passengers. There’s a giant center armrest with storage between the driver and the front passenger seat, as well as one splitting the second-row seats. Up front, the center console sports four cupholders for the incredibly thirsty traveler, but it didn’t fit much other stuff. Besides the cavernous center console, there were no smaller cubbies for things like breath mints, change, a cell phone, etc., and that actually left me feeling a bit cramped, even though there’s no shortage of head, leg or hip room.\n\nThe huge dashboard didn’t leave a great impression on anyone during our week with the Navigator. There’s something odd in the texture of Lincoln’s new interior plastic. It’s hard to put my finger on what it is, but it doesn’t seem nice enough to be in a pseudo-luxury vehicle — though it isn’t what I would call cheap, either. My wife immediately voiced her preference for the Cadillac Escalade’s passenger seat. We spent considerable time in both SUVs, and her immediate distaste for the Navigator isn’t shocking if you compare the two interiors side by side.\n\nThere were some highlights on the inside. For one, I loved the retro gauges. They reminded me of my grandfather’s Cadillacs of the 1970s and early ’80s. Easy to read and extremely distinctive, the gauges make an elegant statement.\n\nThe third row was about as cramped as any third row in a large SUV these days, but the power fold option was nifty to watch. You’ll probably end up hitting that switch an extra time or two, because it’s just that cool.\n\nBy far, the best feature was the ability to enter the Navigator with ease via automatic power-extending running boards that remain hidden until a door is opened. This received high marks from my petite mother-in-law during the holiday season, and even I appreciated the resulting shorter step into the driver’s seat. They’re offered as a $1,095 option on their own, as well as part of a larger option package. I would say it’s probably the most useful option I’ve found in any large SUV, and Lincoln was generous to offer it as a stand-alone option.\n\nPerformance\nA big SUV is all about imposing looks and a muscular engine. The Navigator has the looks part down, but the 300-horsepower V-8 engine seems woefully lacking in the power department, especially at takeoff. There was zero excitement about pressing the gas pedal, and leaving a stoplight never elicited joy of any kind.\n\nSteering, on the other hand, was surprisingly accurate and relatively light for an SUV. When driving a large vehicle it’s often hard to tell how wheel input will translate to the road, but not in the Navigator.\n\nUnfortunately, the brakes didn’t offer the same great feedback and were unreliable in bad weather; I made sure to give myself extra room in highway and city driving. Even the best of brakes would have a tough time slowing down so much weight, and Lincoln should consider upgrading these stoppers, even though they’re already of the four-wheel-disc antilock variety.\n\nThe ride was pleasant on most surfaces, but nothing spectacular; wind noise was also pronounced, as you would expect. The comfortable seats and soft suspension were both welcome on long rides.\n\nMileage is rated at 13/18 mpg (city/highway), and the trip computer stated I was averaging 14 mpg with a lot of highway miles. After a full tank fill up, the mileage was just under 13 mpg. That might sound horrible, but considering the class and how often I was trying to test the V-8’s throttle response, it’s probably a positive for the Navigator.\n\nSafety\nThere’s a standard brake-based stability control system with rollover mitigation, and a tire pressure monitoring system, both of which are must-haves for large SUVs. Tire pressure is always important to keep an eye on, and even more so with SUVs. There are three rows of side curtain airbags, along with seat-mounted side airbags for the driver and front passenger.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Navigator a five-out-of-five-star frontal crash-test rating and a four-out-of-five-star rollover rating for the four-wheel-drive model. The Navigator has not been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which has a more stringent testing process than NHTSA.\n\nWill You Navigate?\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with the new Lincoln Navigator that would make me say someone shouldn’t buy one. If the looks grab you, then it makes perfect sense. If you’re remotely on the fence about picking the Escalade, the near-$10,000 difference in price between the $45,755 Navigator and the $54,500 Escalade could be the difference, though many drivers would be just as happy with a Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition for $35,575 as with a luxury SUV.\n\nIf price and value were the only requirements, the Navigator and Escalade wouldn’t even exist. Some buyers want to make a statement with their SUV, and in that way the Navigator certainly rises above the luxury competition without sapping the kids’ college fund. If the wallet isn’t a factor, the Escalade still wins the all-American Blingmobile prize.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Looks like: The current Navigator with a facelift\n\nCompetes with: Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80, Lexus LX 570\n\nPowertrains: 440-horsepower, turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6; 10-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2022\n\nThe 2022 Lincoln Navigator is setting its sights on the big city — and the big family. The full-size SUV gets exterior styling tweaks, more safety features and a Central Park-inspired interior for the top-tier Black Label trim. Among the technology refinements, the most notable is the addition of Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free driving.\n\nRelated: Do You Really Need the Lincoln Navigator’s Black Label Trim?\n\nThe Navigator is the first Lincoln to offer the hands-free driving system, first launched as BlueCruise in the Ford F-150 and Mustang Mach-E. (Lincoln is Ford’s luxury division.) As before, the SUV will come in regular and extended-length versions, the latter dubbed Navigator L.\n\nHere’s what 2022 Navigator shoppers can expect from the SUV’s updated styling, performance and advanced driver-assist technologies.\n\nA Fresh-Faced Family Hauler\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nExterior styling changes are subtle for the 2022 Navigator, with most enhancements found inside the cabin. The three-row SUV gets a new front end with an updated grille and adaptive pixel projector headlamps, the latter updated. The rear gets three-dimensional LED taillamps that have a fading effect to add depth.\n\nInside, Ford’s new Sync 4 system offers enhanced voice recognition and navigation. The system is accessed via a touchscreen display that grows from the outgoing model’s already-sizable 10 inches to 13.2 inches in the new Navigator. Sync 4 also includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nSecond-row passengers also gain an advantage in the updates for 2022, with climate and audio settings that can be accessed through a new 5.8-inch touchscreen. Added creature comforts include standard heated and ventilated second-row seats, plus an optional massaging function. To minimize the are-we-there-yets, the 2022 Navigator offers a new Lincoln Play rear-seat entertainment system with dual 10.1-inch screens (about the same size as 2021’s), wireless headphones, wireless streaming via Amazon Fire TV, voice control and screen sharing.\n\nPerformance and Capability\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Navigator’s turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 returns in the refreshed SUV, and it’s once again mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. The 2022 model makes 440 horsepower and 510 pounds-feet of torque; power output drops by 10 horses compared to the outgoing model, but Lincoln says the difference is negligible and will not be noticeable to the driver.\n\nWhat drivers will notice, according to Lincoln, is a smoother ride thanks to a new adaptive suspension with a road-preview function. The system uses sensors to monitor vehicle motion, the road and various driver inputs — like steering, acceleration and braking — to mitigate bumps.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator boasts one of the highest towing capacities in its class, with the ability to pull up to 8,700 pounds in rear-wheel-drive models. A new, heavy-duty trailer tow package with trailer reverse guidance offers multiple camera views and steering guidance to help with parking and backing up a trailer.\n\nA Lincoln First: ActiveGlide Hands-Free Driving\n\nThe 2022 Navigator becomes the first vehicle to offer Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free driving system, which allows drivers to let go of the wheel on a network of designated highways called Blue Zones. The Cadillac Escalade, a direct competitor, already offers a similar technology called Super Cruise on 2021 models; the addition of ActiveGlide should help the Navigator keep up with its rival when it comes to driver-assist tech.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nActiveGlide advances the vehicle’s existing adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-limit recognition to steer the vehicle and reduce fatigue. According to Lincoln, the system can be used on more than 130,000 miles of Blue Zone highways across North America.\n\nEven though it offers the option to drive hands-free, ActiveGlide still requires the driver to pay attention and take over control if necessary. (Despite all you might hear about self-driving cars, no production vehicle on sale in the U.S. currently relieves its driver of the need to pay attention, even temporarily.) To ensure the driver stays alert, a driver-facing camera in the Navigator prompts warnings if the driver’s eyes don’t stay on the road. ActiveGlide comes on the Navigator’s Reserve and Black Label models as part of a Co-Pilot360 2.0 Drive program.\n\nRange-Topping Black Label Gets New Interior Themes\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nGoing with the top-tier Black Label trim offers shoppers exclusive interior themes along with special perks like standard premium maintenance, complimentary vehicle detailing and car washes.\n\nLincoln also has two new Black Label themes for the 2022 Navigator.  The first, Central Park, features contrasting open-pore dark walnut wood across the dashboard, with green Venetian leather seating and perforations in the shape of New York’s skyline. Lincoln says the second, Invitation, was inspired by an upscale celebration; it features laser etching used to replicate a party invitation, with open-pore khaya wood blanketing other portions of the interior. Two additional themes return for the 2022 Navigator Black Label: Yacht Club and Chalet.\n\nTrims and Release Date\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nIn addition to the Black Label model, the 2022 Navigator will come in Standard and Reserve trims. The Standard and Reserve models come with rear- or all-wheel drive, while the Black Label is only available with AWD. The 2022 Navigator goes on sale in early 2022, and pricing will be announced closer to the launch date.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s Black or White (But Not Red) All Over? 2020 Lincoln Navigator Monochromatic Package\n2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Drive: Price Meets Expectations\n2018 Lincoln Navigator Review: Luxury and Technology on a Grand Scale\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Navigator is Lincoln’s full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight people in three rows. Related to the Ford Expedition, the SUV is also available in long-wheelbase Navigator L form. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX56.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Navigator L)\n\nNew for 2011\nA voice-controlled navigation system with HD radio technology and Sirius Travel Link is now standard instead of optional for the Navigator, which also gets free maintenance for the first 12 months or 15,000 miles.\n\nExterior\nThe Navigator’s most prominent feature is its grille. It’s an eggcrate design with a large horizontal bar running through the Lincoln logo. Flanking the grille are standard xenon headlights. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard capless fuel system\nStandard rain-sensing wipers\nStandard power liftgate\nStandard 18-inch aluminum wheels; 20-inch chrome rims optional\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe leather-upholstered heated-and-cooled front seats include power adjustments, and there are adjustable pedals to add to driver comfort. Wood accents are found throughout the cabin. Second-row captain’s chairs are standard, but a split-bench seat can be substituted at no extra charge. There’s a standard power-folding third-row seat.\n\nThe Navigator also comes standard with Ford’s Sync voice-operated entertainment and information system and MyKey, which gives buyers the ability to set maximum speed and volume limits based on the key that’s in use — handy for parents sharing the Navigator with a teen driver. Power-lowering running boards are standard, too. Interior features include:\n\nSeats seven or eight\nStandard Sync voice-activated multimedia system\nStandard backup camera\nStandard heated second-row bucket seats\nStandard Sirius Satellite Radio with 14-speaker audio system\nOptional backseat entertainment system with 8-inch screen\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Navigator has standard V-8 power and is available with rear- or four-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 365 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nRuns on regular gas\n9,000-pound (RWD) or 8,700-pound (4WD) towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nThe standard electronic stability system includes trailer sway control, which can detect if a trailer is out of control and apply the brakes or reduce engine power.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control and trailer sway control\nSide-impact airbags for front-seat occupants\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nNavigator L\nThough similar in appearance to the regular Navigator, the long-wheelbase Navigator L is about 15 inches longer and provides 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space with all the seats in place — nearly 25 cubic feet more than the shorter model.\n\nLike the Navigator, the Navigator L is powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, but the Navigator L’s towing capacity of 8,700 pounds for the rear-wheel-drive model and 8,500 pounds for four-wheel-drive versions are both slightly lower than what the regular Navigator achieves.

      "expert_review": "Lincoln Large or Lincoln Lite?\n\nThose desiring a Lincoln-made sport-utility vehicle not only have a choice in 2003, but the two offerings from Ford Motor Co.’s luxury division are all-new for the model year.\n\nFor the record, Lincoln is making no attempt to be clever here. The company’s advertising describes the newly introduced Aviator thusly: “Like Navigator, just smaller.”\n\nThat also applies to the price. On equivalent models, expect to pay about $10,000 less for an Aviator than you would for the big-boy Navigator.\n\nWhat else to look for? Well, let’s start with the Navigator.\n\nThe Navigator is a luxury liner, plain and simple. And at 206 inches long, nearly 78 inches high and almost 6,000 pounds, the big SUV could be mistaken for a cruise ship. Besides bulk, however, it’s those other, flashy Lincoln touches that set the Navigator apart from other full-size sport-utes you might have sampled.\n\nWhen I opened the driver’s side front door on the tested model, a running board sprang from underneath the vehicle and presented itself to be stepped upon. This startled the first time, but I managed to catch myself before launching my body into the bushes for cover.\n\nOther electronic goodies abound. The rear liftgate is powered, yawning open at the touch of a button on the key fob or slowly closing at the touch of another button. Likewise, the third row of seats can be powered down out of harm’s way or opened up to accommodate human beings instead of cargo.\n\nExterior design changes for 2003 include touches that hark back to the 1961 Lincoln Continental — a look that had high priority when designers set to reworking the Navigator for 2003. The look is stout and imposing, but the 2003 Navigator has a more-rounded look than the previous generation. Lincoln engineers say that translates to better aerodynamics.\n\nNavigator’s interior cabin remains appropriately luxurious, with walnut, leather and “satin nickel” surfaces so abundant that one feels inclined to ask if there is a fee to simply sit in the vehicle.\n\nNavigator’s most obvious enhancements for 2003 come to the fore when it is rolling. The ride is quieter and tighter than that experienced in the previous Navigator, and the steering is decidedly more responsive. Lincoln said the improvements were produced by a new four-wheel independent suspension, top-notch rack-and-pinion steering and an upgraded frame that is much firmer than what held up the previous-generation Navigator.\n\nNo argument here. The ’03 Navigator is way more civilized in city and highway driving than its predecessor. Power was no problem with a robust 5.4-liter, 300-horsepower V-8 under the hood. Most of the 355 foot-pounds of torque available was delivered in the low-revolutions-per-minute range.\n\nThings that might make you blink while pondering the Navigator include thirsty fuel economy ratings of 12 miles per gallon in city driving and 17 mpg on the highway. Expect to spend nearly $2,000 a year on fuel, given the current conditions.\n\nAnother blink-inducing factor is price. The tested model was a comparatively humble 4X2 Navigator, which meant a still-hefty starting price of $50,660. Opt for the primo 4X4 version, and the starting fare is nearly $55,000.\n\nToo rich for your blood? Maybe you should think about the Aviator.\n\nThe new-for-2003 SUV rides on the same platform shared by the Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer siblings, but make no mistake, the Aviator is not a dressed-up Ford/Mercury product. It’s a Lincoln all the way.\n\nThe Aviator is just as advertised — a slightly shrunk Lincoln Navigator. Aviator looks like a little Navigator on the outside and feels like a Navigator Lite on the inside.\n\nBesides the lower price — Aviator comes in two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive Luxury and Premium versions, starting from $39,255 to $45,125 — here are the pertinent dimensions on the smaller SUV: 4,957 pounds, 193.3 inches long and 71.4 inches high.\n\nSo, comparatively speaking, an Aviator it not that much smaller than a Navigator.\n\nBut here’s the best part: The Aviator actually performs as well, if not better, than the Navigator in most driving situations.\n\nThrow out the fact that the tested Aviator had all-wheel drive and its accompanying advantages over the tested Navigator’s 2WD. The Aviator comes with a 4.6-liter V-8 that produces 302 horsepower and 300 foot-pounds of torque — again, most of that dished out in the low-rpm range.\n\nFrom a standing start, the tested Aviator walked away from scores of Sacramento-area passenger cars and SUVs of all stripes. In freeway traffic, it powered in and out of tight spots with little strain. The Navigator felt more stable twisting up and down Sierra Nevada roads, but I’d give the Aviator the nod on the flatlands.\n\nThe Navigator is the better towing vehicle — an 8,500-pounds maximum, when properly equipped — but the Aviator is better equipped for the diverse challenges of urban driving.\n\nAlthough the dividing lines of SUV segments have been blurred by the proliferation of crossover vehicles, Lincoln makes its case for the Aviator with a blizzard of what it calls “best-in-class” measurements in the midsize SUV category.\n\nUndoubtedly, the numbers are impressive. They include 8.9 inches of ground clearance, 38.9 inches of head room in the third-row seats, 58.3 inches of shoulder room in the first row, 39.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second-row seats in the six-passenger Aviator (40.2 cubic feet in the seven-passenger version) and maximum towing capacities of 7,100 pounds in AWD and 7,300 in rear-wheel drive.\n\nAgain, fuel economy is not great, with a rating of 13 mpg in city driving and 19 mpg on the highway for the 2WD Aviators. But considering Aviator’s pricing, it falls short of being the frustratingly unobtainable fantasy vehicle that one might call the Navigator. The Aviator is certainly in range of many American households.\n\nAnd for those fortunate enough to afford the fare, the Navigator lives up to the long, luxurious line of Lincoln models.\n\nIt’s all a matter of choice, something new this year in the land of Lincoln.\n\nLincoln Navigator at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2003 Lincoln Navigator.\n\nVehicle type: Seven-to eight-passenger, rear-wheel drive, four-door luxury sport-utility vehicle.\n\nBase price: $50,660 (as tested, $55,615).\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter V-8 with 300 horsepower at 5,000 revolutions per minute and 355 foot-pounds of torque at 2,750 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12 miles per gallon city; 17 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic four-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock a nd special assist features.\n\nSuspension type: Four-wheel independent type with monotube dampers, air springs and stabilizer bars.\n\nCargo volume: Maximum 54.5 cubic feet behind second seats; 104.7 cubic feet behind front seats.\n\nFuel tank: 28 gallons.\n\nFront track: 67 inches.\n\nRear track: 67.1 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 118.8 inches.\n\nTires: P255/70R18 cross-terrain Michelins.\n\nMaximum towing capacity: 8,500 pounds (with specified towing package).\n\nCurb weight: 5,760 pounds.\n\nHeight: 77.8 inches.\n\nLength: 206 inches.\n\nWidth: 80.2 inches.\n\nGround clearance: 8.6 inches.\n\nAssembly site: Wixom, Mich.

      "expert_review": "It’s been more than a decade since the Lincoln Motor Company Navigator’s last redesign, and some long-overdue changes for 2018 modernize it inside and out, including an opulent exterior styling makeover, a new twin-turbo engine and a slick new multimedia system. (Use our tools to compare the new model with the old version.) There’s also an extended version, which we haven’t driven, called the Navigator L; its extra length increases cargo capacity (see them compared).\n\nThe Navigator competes with full-size luxury SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX80 (compare them).\n\nA Rolling Palace\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator announces its arrival — and yours — with an enormous jeweled grille anchored by an illuminated Lincoln emblem, yet its opulence only hints at the luxuries inside.\n\nTo check it out, though, you’ll first have to actually make it inside. The step-in height is high, but I got to skip my usual large-SUV running leap thanks to my favorite standard feature: proximity-activated power running boards. While your key is still in your purse or pocket, the running boards deploy as you approach the vehicle, making climbing into this beast a much more graceful process. Bonus: They also saved me from having to hurl my kids into their car seats. Unlike fixed steps, which err on the higher side to maximize ground clearance, powered running boards extend lower, allowing even little ones to step up into the vehicle.\n\nWhile driving around with a friend, she commented that riding in the Navigator is like riding around in a couch — and she’s close to right. I’d say it’s more like a giant, plush, cushy leather recliner perched in the lobby of a five-diamond hotel. The Lincoln Navigator’s interior is among the most impressive I’ve seen in terms of both features and comfort.\n\nFirst, the seats are nap-worthy. Sink into them and you can almost hear a sigh of relaxation (or maybe that’s the leather breathing). They’re enormous, cushy yet supportive, and they offer seemingly infinite adjustments for maximum comfort. They’re available with 30 power adjustments, they’re heated and they can also be ventilated — and they can be equipped with a massage function.\n\nSecond, materials quality is top-notch, and the design is simple but sophisticated. Everything is padded and looks and feels classy, from the low-gloss wood trim to the supple leather seats. Driving around during my low-key, errand-filled weekend, I felt underdressed.\n\nThere are a couple of bells and whistles that stand out in the rear seats, too. Both the second and third rows have adult-friendly headroom and legroom, and it’s a breeze to get back to the third row — unlike in the QX80. The Lincoln Navigator’s power sliding seats move out of the way to create a huge opening to the third row. In our Car Seat Check, the second row was also roomy enough to accommodate three car seats; two car seats fit in the third row.\n\nAnother highlight of the second row is the Navigator’s illuminated seat belt buckles. Yes, that sounds gimmicky, but they were quite helpful when my second-grader was fumbling around for her buckle in the dark.\n\nBoth rows of seats go down in a sort of power-folding seat ballet controlled by cargo-area buttons. By the numbers, the Navigator has more cargo room than the competition, with 18.1 cubic feet behind the third row, 54.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 103.3 cubic feet with all seats folded. The Escalade offers 15.2/51.6/94.2 cubic feet, and the QX80 has 16.6/49.6/95.1 cubic feet. Note that with both backseat rows folded, the Navigator offers almost 10 cubic feet more than either competitor. If you need more room still, the Navigator L provides 34.3/73.3/120.2 cubic feet.\n\nCouch Pilot\n\nThe other side of the coin is that piloting the Navigator is a lot like driving a couch, too — a massive, whisper-quiet couch; there’s no disguising its enormity on the road. It feels bulky and truck-based in terms of maneuverability, and I relied heavily on the standard multiview camera with distance alert to park it.\n\nI felt comfortable with the Lincoln Navigator’s firm, natural steering, but its handling often felt clumsy. It careened around corners with all the grace of a labradoodle puppy. Ride quality is an issue, too; it’s overly soft and lacks control over big bumps, but it also shimmies over smaller bumps and patches of broken pavement.\n\nPower, however, isn’t a problem. Despite all that heft, the Navigator never felt slow. Its 450-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 was more than enough around town, and it had ample grunt on the highway — though I never tried it loaded down with people or stuff. Its responsiveness is helped by a quick, smooth and well-timed 10-speed automatic transmission, another new feature for 2018. Also new is a stop-start system that could use some polish; it’s pretty intrusive, but can be deactivated via a button on the console.\n\nFuel economy is up for 2018 thanks to the new powertrain. The Lincoln Navigator is EPA-rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive, up from last year’s rating of 15/21/17 mpg. It sacrifices 1 mpg combined when equipped with all-wheel drive. Competitors trail it: The Escalade is rated 14/23/17 and the QX80 is 14/20/16 mpg (both with rear-wheel drive).\n\nBig Leaps in Technology\n\nThe Navigator’s wide array of technology features also dazzles. The standard multimedia system is powered by the latest version of Ford’s Sync system, Sync 3, and has standard Apple Car Play and Android Auto compatibility. The touchscreen is mounted high on the dash for great visibility, and it’s huge. Even better, it’s also responsive and easy to use. Behind the steering wheel is a customizable 12-inch digital instrument display that the driver can alter to show a range of information.\n\nMost of the controls are handily located, but I did find the climate controls to be a little clumsy. Some are grouped separately under the screen, while others appear within menus in the touchscreen; the setup took some acclimation. In the same vein, the electronic gear selector threw me a bit, though I got used to it pretty quickly. The panel features P, R, N and D buttons arranged horizontally and tucked above the climate controls.\n\nWireless hot spot capability for up to 10 devices is standard, as is a wireless charging mat for compatible devices. There are six USB ports, four 12-volt outlets and a 110-volt household outlet to keep devices juiced up.\n\nThough my test car didn’t have a rear entertainment system, there is one available. It has two 10-inch screens mounted to the back of the front seats, each of which can play different content simultaneously via an HDMI- or USB-connected device. Users can also stream content from Android devices wirelessly to the screens; at this point, Apple devices can do so only via a USB cord.\n\nSafety\n\nThe all-new 2018 Lincoln Navigator has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA 360-degree camera system is standard, as is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Other features, like forward collision warning and braking (with the added feature of pedestrian detection), radar-based adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning are optional. Also optional is a new Trailer Backup Assist system, which uses a dial to the right of the steering wheel to help you steer while backing up with a trailer.\n\nBig Ticket Item\n\nLincoln’s new land yacht looks and feels expensive, so its lofty price shouldn’t surprise you. What might surprise you is that its price tag sits in the middle of the competition: The Navigator’s base price starts at $73,250 for two-wheel-drive model. A base Cadillac Escalade starts at $75,990, and the QX80 starts at $64,845 (all prices include destination charges). The Navigator’s price climbs quickly, however: The uplevel Reserve trim I tested topped out at almost $89,000 after adding extras like Burgundy Velvet paint, a premium Revel audio system and — oddly — a $225 single-CD player option.\n\nWith this redesign, Lincoln added heightened levels of style, comfort and technology to the Navigator. As a driver or passenger, you won’t forget it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThe 2023 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for up to eight people, if you choose an optional second-row bench versus the standard dual captain’s chairs. With its massive prow and commanding seating position, the Navigator cuts a path through traffic wherever it ventures. A 440-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 teamed with a 10-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain, though there is a choice between rear- and all-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity is a stout 8,700 pounds. For those who need even more Lincoln SUV in their life, there’s also a long-wheelbase Navigator L. Other than small houses, direct rivals to the Navigator include the Cadillac Escalade, Mercedes-Benz GLS, BMW X7 and Jeep Grand Wagoneer.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThe Navigator receives only small changes for the 2023 model year. Reserve and Black Label trims equipped with the Heavy-Duty Trailer Towing Package now come with an electronic limited-slip differential, and second-row massaging seats are also now standard on those trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nDual second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front- and second-row seats\n14-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seats\n24-way power-adjustable front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nPanoramic moonroof\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSurround-view parking camera\n28-speaker Revel audio system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator is one of the biggest SUVs available today, and it’s priced accordingly: A fully loaded Navigator in long-wheelbase L format and Black Label trim soars well beyond $100,000. Many car shoppers, however, will be fine without adding every conceivable option to this amply proportioned and well-equipped sport-ute. The cabin is elegantly designed, and the tech features are easy to use without needing to spend days reading the owner’s manual. If you need a vehicle of this scale, the Navigator is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "It’s been more than a decade since the Lincoln Motor Company Navigator’s last redesign, and some long-overdue changes for 2018 modernize it inside and out, including an opulent exterior styling makeover, a new twin-turbo engine and a slick new multimedia system. (Use our tools to compare the new model with the old version.) There’s also an extended version, which we haven’t driven, called the Navigator L; its extra length increases cargo capacity (see them compared).\n\nThe Navigator competes with full-size luxury SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX80 (compare them).\n\nA Rolling Palace\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator announces its arrival — and yours — with an enormous jeweled grille anchored by an illuminated Lincoln emblem, yet its opulence only hints at the luxuries inside.\n\nTo check it out, though, you’ll first have to actually make it inside. The step-in height is high, but I got to skip my usual large-SUV running leap thanks to my favorite standard feature: proximity-activated power running boards. While your key is still in your purse or pocket, the running boards deploy as you approach the vehicle, making climbing into this beast a much more graceful process. Bonus: They also saved me from having to hurl my kids into their car seats. Unlike fixed steps, which err on the higher side to maximize ground clearance, powered running boards extend lower, allowing even little ones to step up into the vehicle.\n\nWhile driving around with a friend, she commented that riding in the Navigator is like riding around in a couch — and she’s close to right. I’d say it’s more like a giant, plush, cushy leather recliner perched in the lobby of a five-diamond hotel. The Lincoln Navigator’s interior is among the most impressive I’ve seen in terms of both features and comfort.\n\nFirst, the seats are nap-worthy. Sink into them and you can almost hear a sigh of relaxation (or maybe that’s the leather breathing). They’re enormous, cushy yet supportive, and they offer seemingly infinite adjustments for maximum comfort. They’re available with 30 power adjustments, they’re heated and they can also be ventilated — and they can be equipped with a massage function.\n\nSecond, materials quality is top-notch, and the design is simple but sophisticated. Everything is padded and looks and feels classy, from the low-gloss wood trim to the supple leather seats. Driving around during my low-key, errand-filled weekend, I felt underdressed.\n\nThere are a couple of bells and whistles that stand out in the rear seats, too. Both the second and third rows have adult-friendly headroom and legroom, and it’s a breeze to get back to the third row — unlike in the QX80. The Lincoln Navigator’s power sliding seats move out of the way to create a huge opening to the third row. In our Car Seat Check, the second row was also roomy enough to accommodate three car seats; two car seats fit in the third row.\n\nAnother highlight of the second row is the Navigator’s illuminated seat belt buckles. Yes, that sounds gimmicky, but they were quite helpful when my second-grader was fumbling around for her buckle in the dark.\n\nBoth rows of seats go down in a sort of power-folding seat ballet controlled by cargo-area buttons. By the numbers, the Navigator has more cargo room than the competition, with 18.1 cubic feet behind the third row, 54.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 103.3 cubic feet with all seats folded. The Escalade offers 15.2/51.6/94.2 cubic feet, and the QX80 has 16.6/49.6/95.1 cubic feet. Note that with both backseat rows folded, the Navigator offers almost 10 cubic feet more than either competitor. If you need more room still, the Navigator L provides 34.3/73.3/120.2 cubic feet.\n\nCouch Pilot\n\nThe other side of the coin is that piloting the Navigator is a lot like driving a couch, too — a massive, whisper-quiet couch; there’s no disguising its enormity on the road. It feels bulky and truck-based in terms of maneuverability, and I relied heavily on the standard multiview camera with distance alert to park it.\n\nI felt comfortable with the Lincoln Navigator’s firm, natural steering, but its handling often felt clumsy. It careened around corners with all the grace of a labradoodle puppy. Ride quality is an issue, too; it’s overly soft and lacks control over big bumps, but it also shimmies over smaller bumps and patches of broken pavement.\n\nPower, however, isn’t a problem. Despite all that heft, the Navigator never felt slow. Its 450-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 was more than enough around town, and it had ample grunt on the highway — though I never tried it loaded down with people or stuff. Its responsiveness is helped by a quick, smooth and well-timed 10-speed automatic transmission, another new feature for 2018. Also new is a stop-start system that could use some polish; it’s pretty intrusive, but can be deactivated via a button on the console.\n\nFuel economy is up for 2018 thanks to the new powertrain. The Lincoln Navigator is EPA-rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive, up from last year’s rating of 15/21/17 mpg. It sacrifices 1 mpg combined when equipped with all-wheel drive. Competitors trail it: The Escalade is rated 14/23/17 and the QX80 is 14/20/16 mpg (both with rear-wheel drive).\n\nBig Leaps in Technology\n\nThe Navigator’s wide array of technology features also dazzles. The standard multimedia system is powered by the latest version of Ford’s Sync system, Sync 3, and has standard Apple Car Play and Android Auto compatibility. The touchscreen is mounted high on the dash for great visibility, and it’s huge. Even better, it’s also responsive and easy to use. Behind the steering wheel is a customizable 12-inch digital instrument display that the driver can alter to show a range of information.\n\nMost of the controls are handily located, but I did find the climate controls to be a little clumsy. Some are grouped separately under the screen, while others appear within menus in the touchscreen; the setup took some acclimation. In the same vein, the electronic gear selector threw me a bit, though I got used to it pretty quickly. The panel features P, R, N and D buttons arranged horizontally and tucked above the climate controls.\n\nWireless hot spot capability for up to 10 devices is standard, as is a wireless charging mat for compatible devices. There are six USB ports, four 12-volt outlets and a 110-volt household outlet to keep devices juiced up.\n\nThough my test car didn’t have a rear entertainment system, there is one available. It has two 10-inch screens mounted to the back of the front seats, each of which can play different content simultaneously via an HDMI- or USB-connected device. Users can also stream content from Android devices wirelessly to the screens; at this point, Apple devices can do so only via a USB cord.\n\nSafety\n\nThe all-new 2018 Lincoln Navigator has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA 360-degree camera system is standard, as is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Other features, like forward collision warning and braking (with the added feature of pedestrian detection), radar-based adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning are optional. Also optional is a new Trailer Backup Assist system, which uses a dial to the right of the steering wheel to help you steer while backing up with a trailer.\n\nBig Ticket Item\n\nLincoln’s new land yacht looks and feels expensive, so its lofty price shouldn’t surprise you. What might surprise you is that its price tag sits in the middle of the competition: The Navigator’s base price starts at $73,250 for two-wheel-drive model. A base Cadillac Escalade starts at $75,990, and the QX80 starts at $64,845 (all prices include destination charges). The Navigator’s price climbs quickly, however: The uplevel Reserve trim I tested topped out at almost $89,000 after adding extras like Burgundy Velvet paint, a premium Revel audio system and — oddly — a $225 single-CD player option.\n\nWith this redesign, Lincoln added heightened levels of style, comfort and technology to the Navigator.

      "expert_review": "Faced with competition from an all-new GMC Denali and Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln did what it could to freshen up the 2007 Navigator: A redesign of the front and rear, done on a budget, nonetheless still makes this Navigator look newer than it is. Mission accomplished.\n\nThat does not, however, address the fact that these are not the best times for full-sized luxury SUVs, particularly those rated at 13 mpg in the city. But those customers who want, and perhaps even need, a big sport ute are willing to ante up for the gas and for the price: The test 2007 Navigator, a top-of-the-line Ultimate model, started at $50,655 and ended up at $58,965. If you don’t need the Ultimate, the Luxury model will save you some money, but all those Ultimate owners will feel sorry for you.\n\nOur Navigator was painted “white chocolate tri-coat” (a $495 option), and with the big 20-inch optional chrome-plated wheels ($1,495), you aren’t likely to arrive incognito. The optional Elite package, at $5,450, added a navigation system, a rear-seat entertainment system, and running boards that flip down when you open the doors, flip back up when you close them. Cool.\n\nUnder the hood was Ford’s 5.4-liter, 300-horsepower V-8, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Though the power is there, this engine just doesn’t have the kick-in-the-pants feel of GM’s pushrod V-8 engines. The test Navigator was four-wheel drive, but I didn’t test that, fearful of scratching the white chocolate tri-coat paint or the chrome hood accent (a $50 option).\n\nInside, this is as deluxe as it gets. The stereo, with Sirius satellite service, is superb. Camel-colored leather upholstery is Jaguar-quality, and the front bucket seats are heated and cooled but not at the same time. The one thing missing that should not have been: a rear-view camera, though sensors did beep as I backed too close to a mailbox.\n\nThis is the regular-length Navigator, with a third-row seat that goes up and down with a power switch. There is a Navigator L available, too, which has a 131-inch wheelbase, instead of the regular Navigator’s 119-inch wheelbase. Overall length is 208.4 inches for this model, 223.3 for the L. This one seems plenty big.\n\nOn the road, the Navigator’s ride is as smooth as you would expect. Steering feel is too light for my taste, and when you corner hard, you feel all 6,070 pounds this big boy weighs. Towing capacity for this model, incidentally, is 8,750 pounds.\n\nUnderneath the bling, the Navigator is what it always has been: a very nice Ford Expedition, just like the GMC Denali and Cadillac Escalade are very nice Chevrolet Tahoes. And if that’s what you want — perhaps even need — you would be well-served by any of them.",

      "expert_review": "It’s been more than a decade since the Lincoln Motor Company Navigator’s last redesign, and some long-overdue changes for 2018 modernize it inside and out, including an opulent exterior styling makeover, a new twin-turbo engine and a slick new multimedia system. (Use our tools to compare the new model with the old version.) There’s also an extended version, which we haven’t driven, called the Navigator L; its extra length increases cargo capacity (see them compared).\n\nThe Navigator competes with full-size luxury SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and Infiniti QX80 (compare them).\n\nA Rolling Palace\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator announces its arrival — and yours — with an enormous jeweled grille anchored by an illuminated Lincoln emblem, yet its opulence only hints at the luxuries inside.\n\nTo check it out, though, you’ll first have to actually make it inside. The step-in height is high, but I got to skip my usual large-SUV running leap thanks to my favorite standard feature: proximity-activated power running boards. While your key is still in your purse or pocket, the running boards deploy as you approach the vehicle, making climbing into this beast a much more graceful process. Bonus: They also saved me from having to hurl my kids into their car seats. Unlike fixed steps, which err on the higher side to maximize ground clearance, powered running boards extend lower, allowing even little ones to step up into the vehicle.\n\nWhile driving around with a friend, she commented that riding in the Navigator is like riding around in a couch — and she’s close to right. I’d say it’s more like a giant, plush, cushy leather recliner perched in the lobby of a five-diamond hotel. The Lincoln Navigator’s interior is among the most impressive I’ve seen in terms of both features and comfort.\n\nFirst, the seats are nap-worthy. Sink into them and you can almost hear a sigh of relaxation (or maybe that’s the leather breathing). They’re enormous, cushy yet supportive, and they offer seemingly infinite adjustments for maximum comfort. They’re available with 30 power adjustments, they’re heated and they can also be ventilated — and they can be equipped with a massage function.\n\nSecond, materials quality is top-notch, and the design is simple but sophisticated. Everything is padded and looks and feels classy, from the low-gloss wood trim to the supple leather seats. Driving around during my low-key, errand-filled weekend, I felt underdressed.\n\nThere are a couple of bells and whistles that stand out in the rear seats, too. Both the second and third rows have adult-friendly headroom and legroom, and it’s a breeze to get back to the third row — unlike in the QX80. The Lincoln Navigator’s power sliding seats move out of the way to create a huge opening to the third row. In our Car Seat Check, the second row was also roomy enough to accommodate three car seats; two car seats fit in the third row.\n\nAnother highlight of the second row is the Navigator’s illuminated seat belt buckles. Yes, that sounds gimmicky, but they were quite helpful when my second-grader was fumbling around for her buckle in the dark.\n\nBoth rows of seats go down in a sort of power-folding seat ballet controlled by cargo-area buttons. By the numbers, the Navigator has more cargo room than the competition, with 18.1 cubic feet behind the third row, 54.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 103.3 cubic feet with all seats folded. The Escalade offers 15.2/51.6/94.2 cubic feet, and the QX80 has 16.6/49.6/95.1 cubic feet. Note that with both backseat rows folded, the Navigator offers almost 10 cubic feet more than either competitor. If you need more room still, the Navigator L provides 34.3/73.3/120.2 cubic feet.\n\nCouch Pilot\n\nThe other side of the coin is that piloting the Navigator is a lot like driving a couch, too — a massive, whisper-quiet couch; there’s no disguising its enormity on the road. It feels bulky and truck-based in terms of maneuverability, and I relied heavily on the standard multiview camera with distance alert to park it.\n\nI felt comfortable with the Lincoln Navigator’s firm, natural steering, but its handling often felt clumsy. It careened around corners with all the grace of a labradoodle puppy. Ride quality is an issue, too; it’s overly soft and lacks control over big bumps, but it also shimmies over smaller bumps and patches of broken pavement.\n\nPower, however, isn’t a problem. Despite all that heft, the Navigator never felt slow. Its 450-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 was more than enough around town, and it had ample grunt on the highway — though I never tried it loaded down with people or stuff. Its responsiveness is helped by a quick, smooth and well-timed 10-speed automatic transmission, another new feature for 2018. Also new is a stop-start system that could use some polish; it’s pretty intrusive, but can be deactivated via a button on the console.\n\nFuel economy is up for 2018 thanks to the new powertrain. The Lincoln Navigator is EPA-rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive, up from last year’s rating of 15/21/17 mpg. It sacrifices 1 mpg combined when equipped with all-wheel drive. Competitors trail it: The Escalade is rated 14/23/17 and the QX80 is 14/20/16 mpg (both with rear-wheel drive).\n\nBig Leaps in Technology\n\nThe Navigator’s wide array of technology features also dazzles. The standard multimedia system is powered by the latest version of Ford’s Sync system, Sync 3, and has standard Apple Car Play and Android Auto compatibility. The touchscreen is mounted high on the dash for great visibility, and it’s huge. Even better, it’s also responsive and easy to use. Behind the steering wheel is a customizable 12-inch digital instrument display that the driver can alter to show a range of information.\n\nMost of the controls are handily located, but I did find the climate controls to be a little clumsy. Some are grouped separately under the screen, while others appear within menus in the touchscreen; the setup took some acclimation. In the same vein, the electronic gear selector threw me a bit, though I got used to it pretty quickly. The panel features P, R, N and D buttons arranged horizontally and tucked above the climate controls.\n\nWireless hot spot capability for up to 10 devices is standard, as is a wireless charging mat for compatible devices. There are six USB ports, four 12-volt outlets and a 110-volt household outlet to keep devices juiced up.\n\nThough my test car didn’t have a rear entertainment system, there is one available. It has two 10-inch screens mounted to the back of the front seats, each of which can play different content simultaneously via an HDMI- or USB-connected device. Users can also stream content from Android devices wirelessly to the screens; at this point, Apple devices can do so only via a USB cord.\n\nSafety\n\nThe all-new 2018 Lincoln Navigator has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA 360-degree camera system is standard, as is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Other features, like forward collision warning and braking (with the added feature of pedestrian detection), radar-based adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning are optional. Also optional is a new Trailer Backup Assist system, which uses a dial to the right of the steering wheel to help you steer while backing up with a trailer.\n\nBig Ticket Item\n\nLincoln’s new land yacht looks and feels expensive, so its lofty price shouldn’t surprise you. What might surprise you is that its price tag sits in the middle of the competition: The Navigator’s base price starts at $73,250 for two-wheel-drive model. A base Cadillac Escalade starts at $75,990, and the QX80 starts at $64,845 (all prices include destination charges). The Navigator’s price climbs quickly, however: The uplevel Reserve trim I tested topped out at almost $89,000 after adding extras like Burgundy Velvet paint, a premium Revel audio system and — oddly — a $225 single-CD player option.\n\nWith this redesign, Lincoln added heightened levels of style, comfort and technology to the Navigator. As a driver or passenger, you won’t forget it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
