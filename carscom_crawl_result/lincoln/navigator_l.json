      "expert_review": "Is the Lincoln Navigator a Good Luxury SUV?\n\nWith excellent interior materials, a stunning 48-inch digital dashtop display, undeniable road presence and a selection of interior themes, the updated 2025 Lincoln Navigator is one of the best options in the luxury full-size SUV class.\n\nHow Does the Lincoln Navigator Compare With Other Luxury SUVs?\n\nThe Navigator’s biggest competition comes from the Cadillac Escalade, and though the Navigator is more expensive to start, the Lincoln’s somewhat restrained design and rich standard features makes it an equal contender.\n\nThe U.S is a big country with “bigness” as a byproduct. We’ve got big spaces, big roads, a big sky, big dreams and big appetites, all of which led to the popularity of ever-so-American big luxury. No one does the full-size luxury SUV better; the large, lumbering luxo-leviathans like the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade are some of the best ways to loaf around town and country, especially when you need to haul the family and a sizable boat. Need one? Make sure your shopping list includes the significantly revised ‘n’ refreshed 2025 Lincoln Navigator.\n\nRelated: Ultra-Luxe 2025 Lincoln Navigator Goes Big on Screens\n\nThere’s a heap of stylistic and technology updates, but pricing sees the biggest change for 2025 with the cheapest Navigator sliding in at $101,990 (prices include destination), or nearly $17,000 more than the prior model. Much of this boils down to a trim reorganization, with the discontinuation of the base Premiere trim leaving the mid-grade Reserve as the new point of entry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nOther than additional standard finery, look for new, uh, everything else. A new grille incorporates an available vehicle-wide LED light bar and illuminated Lincoln badge that lends serious valet-lot cred, as do the standard 22-inch wheels (24-inch rims are available). The new liftgate is the most significant exterior revision, now incorporating a handy-dandy split-gate function that offers tailgate functionality for its bottom third. A clever multipurpose cargo divider is also available, tripling as a cargo cover, parcel shelf and tailgate seatback should you desire to watch Junior’s little league game from the parking lot.\n\nBig bruisers of this caliber are hardly the most elegant sleds on the road, but Lincoln’s soft-edged refinement conveys moderate restraint compared with some of the blingiest Escalades — especially if you opt for the available Jet Appearance Package that darkens exterior chrome bits for minimum flash. Muted, mature colors have become a Lincoln hallmark, and I’m quite partial to the deep Flight Blue Metallic that’s available on lower-to-mid trims. If you’re seeking maximum attention at both the carpool lane and country club, step up to the range-topping Black Label trim to unlock the gleaming Sunrise Copper Metallic Pearlcoat paint, a livery that hits critical levels of nouveau riche when combined with the available black exterior trim.\n\n2025 Lincoln Navigator | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Nice Is the 2025 Lincoln Navigator’s Interior?\n\nThe interior undergoes the same cosmetic overhaul, a change that had me a bit more apprehensive than excited. The prior Black Label Navigator was, without pretense, one of the most luxurious cockpits available regardless of price, with great materials, fabulously curated colorways and top-notch presentation. In concert, the Black Label was not too far off from how a hypothetical full-size Bentley SUV would present.\n\nThe new Black Label is no less luxurious, only less intriguing to behold and interact with. Much of the physical controls are now digitized, accessed via the lower 11.1-inch touchscreen that plays a functional second fiddle to the sprawling 48-inch “coast-to-coast” dashtop display previously enjoyed on the Lincoln Nautilus mid-size SUV. This curved screen is a dramatic evolution of a standard digital driver display, with layouts for navigation, vehicle information and infotainment. It’s a visually arresting setup, one that is very much of the current era of automotive design. There’s a lot to look at, so the steering wheel was molded into a squircle — a neologism for a round-edged square — for maximum screen visibility.\n\nAt least on the Black Label that I drove, there’s no region of the cockpit that doesn’t feel properly indulgent. Extended time spent in even the second row’s heated-and-ventilated captain’s chairs should count toward some hotel loyalty programs, buoyed by the second row’s optional seatback entertainment screens and center console with beaucoup storage and wireless charging.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Lincoln Navigator Drive?\n\nAll of this, along with little touches like the faceted crystal volume knob, active cabin scents and a 30-way-adjustable driver’s seat add up to a comprehensively primo driving experience. Speaking of driving, the new Navigator doesn’t feel significantly different from the prior SUV when on the move, mostly due to a carryover platform and drivetrain. The familiar twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine is back, making 440 horsepower and 510 pounds-feet of torque, and it pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard.\n\nHow’s it drive? Big — but with a managed, confident heft not unlike an NFL linebacker cutting up on “Dancing With the Stars.” It’s far from agile, but the adaptive suspension finds a solid balance between composure and supreme cushiness, usually leaning into the latter. Bumps and pavement breaks are muffled with a silk gag and politely drowned in a vat of buttercream, and it’s all complemented by steering and braking that feels filtered through a vat of fondue fromage.\n\nAcceleration is strong for such a large barge, with 0-60 mph likely falling somewhere in the low six-second range. Good stuff when facing down an on-ramp with a full house, but better still for when there’s a trailer in tow. Manually selecting gears for towing or, God forbid, aggressive driving is a smidge tricky, with gear selection managed by two buttons on the flat portion of the center console. Manual anything is antithetical to the very ethos of the 2025 Navigator, so you’d best let all 10 of those gears manage themselves. In fact, why don’t you let the whole darn bus handle the drive? Lincoln’s BlueCruise hands-free cruise control plays the role of fussy chauffeur quite well, handling the majority of highway driving with nary a scare or sketchy moment.\n\n2025 Lincoln Navigator | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBig Timer: Redesigned 2025 Lincoln Navigator Priced From $101,990\n2025 Lincoln Navigator Up Close: New Navigator Goes Nautilus\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\nResearch Lincoln SUVs\nShop for a 2025 Lincoln Navigator Near You\nHow Much Does a 2025 Lincoln Navigator Cost?\n\nFor the most part, those interested in the 2025 Lincoln Navigator will purchase it predicated on its presence, interior appointments, towing capacity, or lease payment and not how the sucker barrels down a California canyon road. Maximum luxury, maximum price: As mentioned above, you can expect to bring your thickest, heaviest checkbook for this new Lincoln. Beyond that roughly $102,000 base Reserve trim, things spiral to somewhere north of $135,000 for a maxed-out, long-wheelbase Black Label Navigator L.\n\nHey, big luxury means big price — and I have a feeling Black Label customers wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for up to eight people; an optional second-row bench with three seats can be chosen over the standard dual captain’s chairs. A 440-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 teamed with a 10-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain. All Navigators now come with four-wheel drive; rear-wheel drive has been discontinued for 2024. Maximum towing capacity is a stout 8,700 pounds. For those who need even more Lincoln SUV in their life, there’s also an extended-length Navigator L version. Direct rivals to the Navigator include the Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV, Mercedes-Benz GLS, BMW X7 and Jeep Grand Wagoneer.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nIn addition to 4WD becoming a standard feature on all Navigators, the base Standard trim has been renamed Premiere. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nDual second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front- and second-row seats\n14-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seats \n24-way power-adjustable front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nPanoramic sunroof\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSurround-view camera system\n28-speaker Revel audio system\nBlueCruise hands-free highway driving assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nWith its massive prow and commanding seating position, the Navigator cuts a path through traffic wherever it ventures. It’s one of the biggest SUVs available today, and it’s priced accordingly: A fully loaded Navigator in Black Label trim soars well beyond $100,000. Many car shoppers, however, will be fine without adding every conceivable option to this amply proportioned — and already well-equipped — sport-ute. The cabin is elegantly designed, and its tech features are easy to use without needing to spend days reading the owner’s manual. If you need a vehicle of this scale, the Navigator is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "It's been over a decade since its last redesign, so we are happy to see a new 2018 Lincoln Navigator make its debut. The Navigator gets some long-overdue changes that modernize the full-size SUV inside and out.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Navigator's cousin, the Ford Expedition, is also redesigned for 2018, and the two share more than a passing resemblance as well as several of the same technological innovations and mechanical bits. However, the Lincoln does have a few extra tricks up its sleeve with more brazen styling and added luxury.\n\nExterior\nMuch of the styling from last year’s Navigator Concept (minus the gull-wing doors) remains intact, including those crazy wheels and the blacked-out pillars which give the roof a floating appearance.\n \nThe SUV’s very vertical nose is highlighted by a large chrome grille with intricate detailing and a large Lincoln logo perched in the middle. Approach the Navigator at night with the key in hand (or in pocket/purse) and, on higher trim levels, the logo will illuminate and a “welcome mat” is projected onto the ground next to the vehicle.\n \nInterior\nInside, the Navigator offers a wide array of technology and family features (with some Expedition overlap between). Lincoln was mum about the actual size of the multimedia screen that will be powered by Sync 3 and offer both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability. The screen has been mounted high on the dash above the center vents and is the centerpiece of the dashboard. Behind the steering wheel is a customizable 12-inch gauge cluster that the driver can alter to display a range of information.\n \nThe Navigator’s technology offerings make a big leap forward. Wireless hot spot capability for up to 10 devices is standard, and a wireless charging mat up front is optional. There are six USB ports, four 12-volt ports and a 110-volt household outlet plug to keep devices juiced up.\n \nAn available rear entertainment system mounts 10-inch screens to the back of the front seats, which can each play different content via an app, HDMI input or USB-connected device. Android devices will be able to stream content wirelessly to the screens, while Apple devices can via a USB cord. Lincoln also partners with Sling Media, which operates Slingbox, so those who utilize that service will be able to stream TV in the Navigator.\n \nSimilar to the Lincoln Continental, the Navigator’s front seats will be available with 30 different power adjustments for added comfort. The seats are also heated and ventilated, and come with a massage function. Additionally, Lincoln will offer three “Black Label” versions of the Navigator: Yacht Club, Destination and Chalet. The Black Label vehicles each come with a unique interior theme and color scheme, and will offer unique owner amenities like free carwashes and extended service and maintenance coverage.\n \nUnder the Hood\nLincoln is keeping mum on engine specifics but the automaker did say that the engine would be a twin-turbo V-6 that makes around 450 horsepower. Best guess is that this is a modified version of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 in the Ford F-150 Raptor. A 10-speed automatic transmission is also new for 2018, and the Navigator will be offered in both rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations. The switch to an aluminum body shaves off about 200 pounds.\n \nThe Navigator also adds Trailer Backup Assist, which uses a dial located to the bottom left of the steering wheel to help steer a trailer without having to use the wheel to do it.\n \nSafety\nA new safety feature is debuting on the Navigator: speed-dependent adaptive lighting. When traveling at lower speeds, the headlights offer a wider spread for area visibility for areas like neighborhoods or parking lots. Start to move more quickly and the beam tightens to keep the driver focused on the road ahead and lessen the glare from road signs.\n \nAlso available are driver assistance technologies such as a 360-degree surround-view camera system, head-up display and adaptive cruise control.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nRedesigned last year, the Lincoln Navigator full-size luxury SUV seats seven or eight, depending on configuration, and is powered by a 450-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, and if you need extra space Lincoln also sells a long-wheelbase version of the Navigator, dubbed L. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade, Lexus LX 570 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 20-inch aluminum wheels, a Revel stereo, Ford’s Sync 3 touchscreen multimedia system, navigation, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats and heated second-row captain’s chairs. Available features include 22-inch wheels, ventilated front seats, a panoramic moonroof and premium leather.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nWith its striking design and luxurious interior, Lincoln reestablished the Navigator’s presence in the full-size luxury SUV market with its 2018 redesign. A powerful drivetrain, comfortable and roomy cabin, and easy-to-use technology heighten the SUV’s appeal. It can get expensive, however: Top-of-the-line Navigators near a six-figure price tag.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nRelated to the Ford Expedition, the Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for seven or eight depending on second-row configuration. It’s powered by a standard 450-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, and if you need extra space, Lincoln sells a long-wheelbase version called the Navigator L. Competitors include the Cadillac Escalade, Lexus LX 570 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nNew standard features include an adaptive suspension, power running boards, a phone-based key, and heated and ventilated front seats. Automatic high-beam headlights are now standard and part of the Lincoln Co-Pilot360 safety system. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 20-inch aluminum wheels, a Revel stereo, Ford’s Sync 3 multimedia system, navigation and heated second-row captain’s chairs. The larger Navigator L offers considerably more cargo room behind the third-row seat, and the SUV’s 450-hp V-6 has more than enough power to move the Navigator with ease. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Lincoln Navigator?\n\nIf you need a large SUV with room for people and cargo, the Navigator is a great choice. Its powerful drivetrain, comfortable and roomy cabin, and easy-to-use technology are highlights. It can get expensive, however: Top-of-the-line Navigators have six-figure price tags.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\nThe 2023 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for up to eight people, if you choose an optional second-row bench versus the standard dual captain’s chairs. With its massive prow and commanding seating position, the Navigator cuts a path through traffic wherever it ventures. A 440-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 teamed with a 10-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain, though there is a choice between rear- and all-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity is a stout 8,700 pounds. For those who need even more Lincoln SUV in their life, there’s also a long-wheelbase Navigator L. Other than small houses, direct rivals to the Navigator include the Cadillac Escalade, Mercedes-Benz GLS, BMW X7 and Jeep Grand Wagoneer.\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\nThe Navigator receives only small changes for the 2023 model year. Reserve and Black Label trims equipped with the Heavy-Duty Trailer Towing Package now come with an electronic limited-slip differential, and second-row massaging seats are also now standard on those trims.\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lincoln Navigator Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n13.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nDual second-row captain’s chairs\nHeated and ventilated front- and second-row seats\n14-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seats\n24-way power-adjustable front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up instrument display\nPanoramic moonroof\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nSurround-view parking camera\n28-speaker Revel audio system\n\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lincoln Navigator?\nThe Lincoln Navigator is one of the biggest SUVs available today, and it’s priced accordingly: A fully loaded Navigator in long-wheelbase L format and Black Label trim soars well beyond $100,000. Many car shoppers, however, will be fine without adding every conceivable option to this amply proportioned and well-equipped sport-ute. The cabin is elegantly designed, and the tech features are easy to use without needing to spend days reading the owner’s manual. If you need a vehicle of this scale, the Navigator is worth a test drive.",

      "expert_review": "Looks like: The current Navigator with a facelift\n\nCompetes with: Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80, Lexus LX 570\n\nPowertrains: 440-horsepower, turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6; 10-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2022\n\nThe 2022 Lincoln Navigator is setting its sights on the big city — and the big family. The full-size SUV gets exterior styling tweaks, more safety features and a Central Park-inspired interior for the top-tier Black Label trim. Among the technology refinements, the most notable is the addition of Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free driving.\n\nRelated: Do You Really Need the Lincoln Navigator’s Black Label Trim?\n\nThe Navigator is the first Lincoln to offer the hands-free driving system, first launched as BlueCruise in the Ford F-150 and Mustang Mach-E. (Lincoln is Ford’s luxury division.) As before, the SUV will come in regular and extended-length versions, the latter dubbed Navigator L.\n\nHere’s what 2022 Navigator shoppers can expect from the SUV’s updated styling, performance and advanced driver-assist technologies.\n\nA Fresh-Faced Family Hauler\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nExterior styling changes are subtle for the 2022 Navigator, with most enhancements found inside the cabin. The three-row SUV gets a new front end with an updated grille and adaptive pixel projector headlamps, the latter updated. The rear gets three-dimensional LED taillamps that have a fading effect to add depth.\n\nInside, Ford’s new Sync 4 system offers enhanced voice recognition and navigation. The system is accessed via a touchscreen display that grows from the outgoing model’s already-sizable 10 inches to 13.2 inches in the new Navigator. Sync 4 also includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nSecond-row passengers also gain an advantage in the updates for 2022, with climate and audio settings that can be accessed through a new 5.8-inch touchscreen. Added creature comforts include standard heated and ventilated second-row seats, plus an optional massaging function. To minimize the are-we-there-yets, the 2022 Navigator offers a new Lincoln Play rear-seat entertainment system with dual 10.1-inch screens (about the same size as 2021’s), wireless headphones, wireless streaming via Amazon Fire TV, voice control and screen sharing.\n\nPerformance and Capability\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Navigator’s turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 returns in the refreshed SUV, and it’s once again mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. The 2022 model makes 440 horsepower and 510 pounds-feet of torque; power output drops by 10 horses compared to the outgoing model, but Lincoln says the difference is negligible and will not be noticeable to the driver.\n\nWhat drivers will notice, according to Lincoln, is a smoother ride thanks to a new adaptive suspension with a road-preview function. The system uses sensors to monitor vehicle motion, the road and various driver inputs — like steering, acceleration and braking — to mitigate bumps.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Lincoln Navigator boasts one of the highest towing capacities in its class, with the ability to pull up to 8,700 pounds in rear-wheel-drive models. A new, heavy-duty trailer tow package with trailer reverse guidance offers multiple camera views and steering guidance to help with parking and backing up a trailer.\n\nA Lincoln First: ActiveGlide Hands-Free Driving\n\nThe 2022 Navigator becomes the first vehicle to offer Lincoln’s ActiveGlide hands-free driving system, which allows drivers to let go of the wheel on a network of designated highways called Blue Zones. The Cadillac Escalade, a direct competitor, already offers a similar technology called Super Cruise on 2021 models; the addition of ActiveGlide should help the Navigator keep up with its rival when it comes to driver-assist tech.\n\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nActiveGlide advances the vehicle’s existing adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-limit recognition to steer the vehicle and reduce fatigue. According to Lincoln, the system can be used on more than 130,000 miles of Blue Zone highways across North America.\n\nEven though it offers the option to drive hands-free, ActiveGlide still requires the driver to pay attention and take over control if necessary. (Despite all you might hear about self-driving cars, no production vehicle on sale in the U.S. currently relieves its driver of the need to pay attention, even temporarily.) To ensure the driver stays alert, a driver-facing camera in the Navigator prompts warnings if the driver’s eyes don’t stay on the road. ActiveGlide comes on the Navigator’s Reserve and Black Label models as part of a Co-Pilot360 2.0 Drive program.\n\nRange-Topping Black Label Gets New Interior Themes\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nGoing with the top-tier Black Label trim offers shoppers exclusive interior themes along with special perks like standard premium maintenance, complimentary vehicle detailing and car washes.\n\nLincoln also has two new Black Label themes for the 2022 Navigator.  The first, Central Park, features contrasting open-pore dark walnut wood across the dashboard, with green Venetian leather seating and perforations in the shape of New York’s skyline. Lincoln says the second, Invitation, was inspired by an upscale celebration; it features laser etching used to replicate a party invitation, with open-pore khaya wood blanketing other portions of the interior. Two additional themes return for the 2022 Navigator Black Label: Yacht Club and Chalet.\n\nTrims and Release Date\n2022 Lincoln Navigator | Manufacturer image\n\nIn addition to the Black Label model, the 2022 Navigator will come in Standard and Reserve trims. The Standard and Reserve models come with rear- or all-wheel drive, while the Black Label is only available with AWD. The 2022 Navigator goes on sale in early 2022, and pricing will be announced closer to the launch date.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s Black or White (But Not Red) All Over? 2020 Lincoln Navigator Monochromatic Package\n2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Drive: Price Meets Expectations\n2018 Lincoln Navigator Review: Luxury and Technology on a Grand Scale\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
