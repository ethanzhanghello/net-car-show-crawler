      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter five years of offering a single sport utility vehicle, the full-size Navigator, Lincoln added a smaller SUV to its 2003-model-year lineup. Related to the midsize Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer, the Aviator bears a distinct resemblance to the Navigator.\n\nFor 2005, the Aviator lineup has been simplified. Last year’s Luxury series has gained the equipment previously restricted to the Ultimate series, which has been dropped. The grille has been modified, and new exterior colors and one new interior color are available.\n\nAll Aviators now come equipped with Ford’s AdvanceTrac electronic stability system and Roll Stability Control. Seven-spoke, 17-inch aluminum wheels are now standard.\n\nOther standard equipment includes a tire-pressure monitor and rear parking assist. Built with body-on-frame construction, the Aviator has a fully independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nExterior\nThe Aviator shares its basic styling with other Lincoln sedans and SUVs. It flaunts a large grille with new chrome surround and slots, flanked by large clear-lens headlights. Round fog lamps are built into the front bumper fascia.\n\nMany chassis parts, including an extra-thick windshield, were specially fabricated to keep noise and vibration levels down. The Aviator has a two-piece liftgate with flip-up rear glass.\n\nBuilt on a 113.7-inch wheelbase, the Aviator stretches 193.3 inches long overall and stands 71.9 inches tall. Integrated running boards are standard.\n\nInterior\nEither a three-place bench or bucket seats may be installed in the second row. The Aviator carries seven people when it is equipped with the 40/20/40-split second-row bench seat; six occupants fit inside when twin bucket seats and a second-row center console are installed. The third-row seat folds flat into the floor. Cargo space totals 78.3 cubic feet with the second- and third-row seats folded.\n\nAn analog clock sits on the dashboard. Interior styling cues include the use of satin nickel finish, American burl walnut wood and premium leather upholstery.\n\nAll Aviators have power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals. Standard equipment includes dual-zone climate control, power heated mirrors, power lumbar adjustment, a cassette/CD stereo and keyless entry. A DVD-based navigation system with an in-dash six-CD changer is included in Elite option packages.\n\nA backseat DVD-based entertainment system, heated and cooled front seats, and an Audiophile six-CD changer are also optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLincoln’s 4.6-liter V-8 generates 302 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque; it drives a five-speed-automatic transmission. Towing capacity with all-wheel drive is 7,100 pounds. Aviators also are offered with rear-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nIn addition to all-disc antilock brakes, the Aviator features Ford’s Safety Canopy, which deploys side curtain-type airbags during rollovers and side-impact collisions. The AdvanceTrac system includes Roll Stability Control.",

      "expert_review": "Brace yourselves for this one.\n\nLincoln has made a new sport utility vehicle. And it does not come with landing lights.\n\nIt does not “Beep, beep, beep” when it backs up. It does not come with a sticker that asks, “How’s my driving?”\n\nBrace yourselves. It’s actually driveable.\n\nJust when you thought the 341st SUV to hit the market was going to try to outsize the rest of the field, Lincoln took a deep breath and stepped off the scale.\n\nEven Lincoln admits as much.\n\n“Like Navigator,” the automaker says about its 2003 Aviator, “just smaller.”\n\nCan we hear an amen?\n\nJust when the notion of climbing inside another brute-ute was starting to get to us, Lincoln decided it was time to try Slim Fast.\n\nCall the Aviator a Lincoln Lite. Looks great. Less filling. And not a Navigator.\n\nThe point here is obvious: If you are interested in owning a Lincoln, but not interested in owning a luxury liner, you can downsize a little. Lincoln expects 85 percent of its young, affluent buyers to be new to the brand. At 10 grand less, it is a good place to start.\n\nNow the idea of going smaller is nothing new in the sport-ute market. It’s just new to Lincoln. The automaker was the first to enter the full-size luxury SUV market with the 1998 Navigator. But it has been sitting on the sidelines ever since as Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and BMW have put their stamp on the midsize-ute market. Until now.\n\nIn the Aviator, Lincoln has kept many of the Navigator qualities without the dimensions.\n\nBuilt on the same platform as the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer, the Aviator is actually a miniature version of the Navigator. It has the same creature comforts, the same luxury appointments and the same Lincoln look. Besides the lower price – the Aviator starts at $39,255 – it is also 1,000 pounds lighter and a foot shorter.\n\nIn short, manageable.\n\nAvailable in two-wheel or four-wheel drive Luxury and Premium versions, the Aviator is a performer that everyone can appreciate.\n\nFrom the first turn of the key to the final step on the brake, the Aviator soars with some of the best competition out there – the BMW X5, Acura MDX and Mercedes ML 500.\n\nA five-speed automatic transmission sends a considerable amount of thrust to the tires and, with a stellar body-on-frame design, the Lincoln also has a sizeable towing advantage over the competition – 7,300 pounds in the all-wheel-drive version.\n\nThe 302-horsepower 4.6-liter V-8 produces good low-end torque – that pull you get from stepping on the pedal at the stoplight – and is capable of zipping this 5,000-pound ride in and around traffic as well as onto the interstate. The well-tuned four-wheel independent suspension gives you a firm ride and allows you to actually take it off-road (something not suggested in the Navigator).\n\nOn the road, it’s a breeze to drive. The goal at Lincoln was to provide precise handling and steering feel without sacrificing a smooth ride. Check all the above.\n\nUnlike the Navigator, the Aviator is not a size-XXL burden.\n\nBut from every angle there is no mistaking the fact this is still a Lincoln.\n\nThe waterfall grille in front and the flat rear make the Aviator look like a Navigator that’s been shrunk. Inside it’s more of the same. The cabin features a symmetrical dash, plenty of wood trim, power-adjustable pedals and enough leather to make more than a few cows nervous. It is upscale all the way – metal accents, a classy analog clock and gauges and dials that come with a nice trim. And there are options galore – from heated/cooled seats to a DVD rear entertainment system.\n\nWith enough money, you can do your Aviator up just like the big boys. More importantly, there is also a good measure of versatility. In addition to providing a choice of bucket seats or a bench for the second row, the Aviator also boasts more third-seat legroom than the full-size Cadillac Escalade. And the Aviator can carry 77 cubic feet of cargo, which is equivalent to the Lexus GX 470.\n\nOn safety, the Aviator includes hefty anti-lock brakes (13 inches in the front with dual-piston calipers) and side-curtain air bags, which also provide protection in a rollover.\n\nOn technology, the Aviator is tops. The Explorer’s V8 has been nicely refined in this ride and there is top-notch hardware throughout – from monotube shocks to extra-large stabilizer to performance glazed glass that absorbs noise.\n\nAnd there are other impressive features. The Aviator comes with nearly nine inches of ground clearance, three feet of head room in the third row and a ton of cargo room.\n\nDrawbacks?\n\nFuel economy is not great – 13 mpg in the city and 18 on the highway. The placement of the automatic window switches is awkward given that they are in the center console, not on the doors, and right about where your right elbow rests. And price can become an issue when loaded up with all the extras.\n\nWithout the extras, the Aviator is a worthwhile, luxo-class competitor that starts under $40,000.\n\nFortunately, price is not the only thing that is finally smaller.\n\n2003 Lincoln Aviator\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nHigh gear: Comfort, class and – get this – compact (OK, more compact than most brutish SUVs), the Aviator is a scaled-down version of the Navigator that still offers cargo room and all the Lincoln extras, without the XXL size.\n\nLow gear: Fuel economy can be a drag on the wallet, the placement of window switches is awkward and price can become an issue with all the extras.\n\nVehicle type: Rear- or all-wheel drive, front-engine, four-door, six- or seven-passenger luxury sport utility vehicle.\n\nKey standard equipment: Five-speed automatic transmission; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; remote anti-theft alarm system; fog lights; rear parking sensors; leather upholstery; six-way power driver and passenger seat; rear heating ducts with fan control; power windows, door locks and heated mirrors; cruise control; tilt steering; height-adjustable pedals; dual-zone climate control; AM/FM cassette in-dash single CD player.\n\nKey competition: GMC Envoy XL, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Infiniti QX4\n\nBase engine: 302 horsepower, 32-valve DOHC, 4.6-liter V-8\n\nTorque: 300 ft.-lbs. @ 3,250 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 113.7 inches\n\nLength: 193.3 inches\n\nMPG rating: 13 city/18 highway\n\nManufactured: St. Louis\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; drivetrain is four years/50,000 miles; roadside assistance is four years/50,000 miles; and rust is five years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price: $39,255",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to siblings, it seems the middle child always seems to get less attention.\n\nAnd so it goes with the new Lincoln Aviator SUV.\n\nJust as the Navigator is an upscale interpretation of the Ford Expedition, the Aviator is an upscale interpretation of the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer.\n\nThe Navigator’s base price ranges from $49,050 to $62,910. The Aviator starts at $39,995 and runs to $54,635.\n\nBut a slightly less luxurious Mercury Mountaineer ranges in base price from $29,950 to $40,125.\n\nThe Aviator hit dealer showrooms in November 2002, but it hasn’t taken flight. Lincoln has sold 6,789 Aviators through the end of March, according to the industry trade publication Automotive News.\n\nFord executives are concerned with the same report indicating that buyers are either opting for the similar, yet $10,000 cheaper, Mercury Mountaineer or a more-expensive Lincoln Navigator over the new Aviator.\n\nSo the question remains: are buyers being saavy or are they overlooking a good thing?\n\nWhile it’s true that there is much of the Lincoln Aviator in the Mercury Mountaineer, Lincoln has ensured that you’re getting more for the difference in price.\n\nWhile the Mountaineer can be had with either a six or eight-cylinder engine, the Aviator has one engine: a 302-horsepower double-overhead-cam 4.6-liter V-8. The Mountaineer’s 4.6-liter V-8 is a single overhead cam and churns out a respectable 240 horsepower.\n\nLike the Mercury, the Aviator is available with rear-wheel or all-wheel-drive.\n\nUnlike some of its car-based competition (such as Lexus RX 300 or Acura MDX), the Aviator uses body-on-frame construction, giving the truck a solid, tough foundation. Unlike most truck-based SUVs, the Aviator (like the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer) employs a fully independent suspension. Lincoln has taken advantage of this by giving the Aviator road manners similar to that of the Lincoln LS sports sedan. It feels planted, allowing for confident maneuvering.\n\nBody lean is minimal and very well controlled. There’s little of the ride softness one feels in the Navigator. However, the Aviator does an admirable job of soaking up bumps.\n\nPower is quick off the line and quite substantial. The accelerator seems touchy upon initial acceleration, so that smooth starts are hard to accomplish. But, the transmission shifts quickly and unobtrusively.\n\nThe test vehicle came with all-wheel-drive, although rear-wheel-drive is available. Under normal conditions, 35 percent of the power goes to the front wheels, while 65 percent goes to the rear. Up to 90 percent of the available power can be transferred to the front or rear.\n\nWhile all of this is noteworthy, most of it can applies to the Aviator’s lesser siblings, the Mountaineer and Explorer.\n\nBut the Aviator is blessed with one of the finest interior designs of any American vehicl e.\n\nThe dashboard looks as if it came straight from a mid-’60s Lincoln Continental. Its real walnut trim contrasts beautifully with the eggshell-colored vinyl and leather seats.\n\nAs you’d expect of a Lincoln, there are many convenience features.\n\nThe front seats are heated and air-conditioned. The power adjustments help front seat occupants find a comfortable position. Strangely, the backrest angle is adjusted manually, which seems shortsighted in a truck that starts at $39,995.\n\nThe second row seats are short and shallow, while the third row is strictly for kids. Both second and third rows fold. The third row isn’t power activated, as on the Navigator.\n\nOther available niceties include power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals, a keyless-entry keypad on the driver’s side, running boards, an AM/FM/audio system with in-dash six-CD changer, power moonroof, dual-zone electronic automatic climate control, DVD rear-seat entertainment system, and a Reverse Sensing System that detects obstacles to the rear while the vehicle is backing up. Of course, all of this is available on the Mercury Mountaineer as well.\n\nA unique feature allows the second row split-folding, rear bench seat to be replaced with two bucket seats and a console. This adds to passenger comfort and appears to be a worthwhile option, especially as it would separate warring siblings.\n\nFord did an admirable job of ensuring occupant safety. Features include dual-stage front air bags, a side curtain air-bag system (which provides enhanced occupant protection in side impacts and rollovers) as well as systems designed to aid drivers in the event of a skid.\n\nMany buyers would find the price premium hard to swallow, but the siren song of the Lincoln’s styling and incredible power do much to make the higher tariff more bearable.\n\nSadly, the test vehicle didn’t live up to the quality standard that one expects of Lincoln. The rear tailgate was balky to open; a trim piece had fallen off. Neither is a big indictment and can happen on any car or truck. But the power passenger seat failed to work, something that shouldn’t fail with as little as 10,000 miles on the odometer.\n\nFuel economy was typical for an all-wheel-drive, V-8-powered SUV. Mixed city/highway driving returned 13.6 mpg. The Aviator uses premium fuel.\n\nYou can get an Aviator in two trim levels. The base version is called Luxury, while the upscale version is dubbed Premium. A rear-drive Luxury starts at $39,995. Adding all-wheel-drive raises that to $42,915. A rear-wheel-drive Premium Aviator starts at $42,945, while the test vehicle starts at $45,865. All prices include the destination charge.\n\nWhile the Aviator may not strike a value-conscious buyer as the best buy in the Mountaineer/Aviator/Navigator trio, it is more powerful and stylish than a Mountaineer and easier to handle than the giant Navigator.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: At the lower end of its price range, the 2025 Lincoln Aviator is a competitive and luxurious three-row SUV, but the high-end Black Label version doesn’t offer the goods to warrant its nearly six-figure price tag.\n\nVersus the competition: A mild refresh with new interior screens helps the 2025 Aviator stay current with an array of mid-size luxury SUVs.\n\nThe 2025 Lincoln Aviator is a three-row mid-size SUV based on the Ford Explorer, but you’d be hard-pressed to find evidence of that if you poked your head inside our Aviator test car. The Aviator is updated for 2025, and as you may have guessed, we didn’t test a paltry $60,000 entry-level version: We drove a top-of-the-line Aviator Black Label that, with options, came in at an insane $97,000. Let’s go through what makes this Aviator a nearly $100,000 SUV — and whether it’s worth that price.\n\nRelated: 2025 Lincoln Aviator: Refreshed Interior, $59,890 Base Price\n\nWhat Is the Aviator Black Label?\n\nThe Black Label is the Aviator’s top trim level. It starts at roughly $88,000 — already in the stratosphere — mostly because the Black Label adds every package that’s optional on lesser trims, including Luxury, Illumination, Trailer Tow and Dynamic Handling packages.\n\nThis means the Black Label comes with all these features:\n\n30-way adjustable front seats with massage\nRevel Ultima 3D Audio System with 28 speakers\nStandard all-wheel drive\n22-inch wheels\nClass III tow hitch with four- and seven-pin wiring connectors for a 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity\nAir glide suspension with automatic-lowering entry height\nHeated and ventilated first- and second-row seats\n\nThe next layer to the Black Label is a choice of interior themes — Flight, Invitation or Moonbeam — that include color, materials and accent stylization inspired by the heyday of travel. The SUV I tested used the Invitation theme, which combines a darker, open-pore wood with leather seats featuring Brandy stitching. Our Aviator Black Label also had $750 Asher Gray paint, a $480 full rear console with two USB charge ports and rear shade controls, and a $7,250 Black Label Special Edition Package. That package includes:\n\nUnique 22-inch wheels\nBlack-painted exterior trim\nBody-colored lower front and rear trim, door cladding and wheel lips\nBlack-painted roof\n\nThe Black Label also brings along ownership privileges, including:\n\nFree maintenance for four years, 50,000 miles or four service visits\nHome delivery\nMore reward points for maintenance or premium services\nComplimentary car washes\nAvis President’s Club membership\n\nNote, however, that some of these ownership perks are reliant on buying from a participating dealership. In the Chicago area, where Cars.com is headquartered, there are 25 Lincoln dealerships within 300 miles, and all 25 were marked as Black Label dealers in Lincoln’s dealership finder.\n\nInterior Quality and Size\n\nThe Aviator’s interior has a real sense of quality; it feels, looks and smells like an authentic luxury car, though perhaps not as luxurious as a BMW X5 or Porsche Cayenne, both of which can top six figures. The Aviator’s interior impresses more in the SUV’s $60,000-$70,000 range. For 2025, the Aviator’s cabin has been updated with a new 12.4-inch digital instrument panel and 13.2-inch center touchscreen. They modernize the interior in a big way, but I didn’t love either of them; I’m not a terribly tall person, at about 6 feet tall and average build, but I struggled to get a good view of both.\n\nThe center touchscreen is mounted a little more rearward than usual and faces straight at the second row, not toward the driver, making it hard to easily reference and use. The digital user interface within that touchscreen is easy to use, but Lincoln put the climate controls in the touchscreen, which is never preferable to hard buttons. It takes away some of the real, tactile luxury experience that buttons and dials can provide.\n\nThen there’s the instrument panel, which I couldn’t see in its entirety because the steering wheel always partially blocked the screen; I could not find a comfortable and safe driving position from which I could see the whole screen. I think I could have gotten there if the seat could be lowered just a little more, but it couldn’t. For those who can find a good view, the instrument panel itself is well done — easy to read while still looking stylish and contemporary.\n\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Black Label, front-row seat | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThen there are the front seats, which prove that more adjustability is not always better. I couldn’t get comfortable in these seats, and I don’t normally have issues with seating comfort in test cars. It felt like my thighs and middle back were touching the seat but everything else was just floating. And I’m not a wide person, but even with the side bolsters relaxed all the way, they were too tight.\n\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Black Label, second-row | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe narrow second-row seats aren’t much better, and the third row is best suited for smaller individuals or kids. Using child-safety seats in the Aviator also created issues: With car seats in the second row, there’s no way for third-row passengers to get to the rearmost seats because the fixed console between the second-row seats eliminates the walkway that exists without the console. The only way to get back there is to unlatch a child seat to slide the Aviator’s seat forward. When I had the car loaded with my two kids, a third-row passenger had to climb in from the cargo area. I don’t expect the Aviator to be a dedicated family-hauler like the Explorer, but it shouldn’t be that difficult to access the third row with car seats in place.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nFor 2025, a 400-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 working with a 10-speed automatic transmission is the only powertrain. A plug-in hybrid system in the Aviator Grand Touring was last offered for 2023, but we don’t miss it; it was a wonky drivetrain that never felt cohesive.\n\nThe Aviator’s twin-turbo V-6 is a powerful engine that offers good acceleration, but if its EPA-estimated gas mileage of 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined with AWD isn’t satisfactory, there isn’t a more efficient powertrain to choose. What’s nice, however, is that the Aviator can run just fine on 87-octane gasoline, even though premium 91-octane is recommended for best performance.\n\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Black Label, engine | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe Black Label’s air suspension dampens large bumps well, but its overall ride quality is let down by the loud slapping of tire impacts and constant jittery impacts from the 22-inch wheels. Even on smooth roads, you can always feel and hear the tires and wheels moving up and down; one third-row passenger was not particularly thrilled being back there for a 40-minute drive. Yet even though the ride is tuned firmly, spirited driving isn’t very rewarding.\n\nFor those who want to do less driving, there’s BlueCruise, a newly available semi-autonomous hands-free driving system. It works well when engaged, and I’ve found it to be a real fatigue-reducer on longer highway trips. It won’t change lanes for you when a spot is open, unlike a rival system from Cadillac, but otherwise, it’s easy to feel comfortable driving hands-free.\n\nVersus the Genesis GV80\n\nThe Aviator’s closest competitor is the Genesis GV80, which has a third row only in its 3.5T Advanced trim level. The GV80 is a favorite of ours, and it’s also updated for 2025. I’ve driven both the GV80 and Aviator, and doing so reaffirmed that the Genesis is the more luxurious, more comfortable and more value-laden mid-size luxury SUV. If you absolutely need a third row, though, your choices are severely limited in the GV80 because the third row is only available in one trim level with one powertrain. The GV80’s third row also offers less headroom than the Aviator’s.\n\nIs the Black Label Worth It?\n\nWhen our team talked about the Aviator’s as-tested price, one editor said that, with that money, they could buy nine decent C-Body Mopars (full-size vintage Dodges, Chryslers and Plymouths). Another pointed out it’s enough for 19,000 Chalupa Supremes. For me, I’d split the difference and take a Genesis GV80 Advanced with the third row ($75,750), one Plymouth Fury ($10,700) and 2,000 Chalupa Supremes ($10,300). If you really like what the Aviator delivers, though, I suggest looking at one of its lesser trim levels; the level of luxury you get in an Aviator Black Label just isn’t enough to command $90,000-plus.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Lincoln Aviator Preview: More Tech for More Money\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nThe Lincoln Aviator is a three-row luxury mid-size SUV that competes with a wide range of rivals, including the Genesis GV80, Lexus RX and TX, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. A smooth ride and powerful 400-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 make this Lincoln both a calming and quick place in which to spend time.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nThe Grand Touring plug-in hybrid version has been discontinued and the entry-level Standard trim level has been renamed Premiere. The Aviator is scheduled to get a significant refresh for the 2025 model year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Lincoln Aviator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nFour USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nTri-zone climate control\n10-speaker audio system\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nQuad-zone climate control\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\n20- or 22-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nLincoln has a recent habit of delivering luxury SUVs that are roomy, quiet, relaxing to drive and relatively affordable compared with pricier rivals. The three-row Aviator is no exception: It’s attractive, comfortable and has an infotainment system that takes only a moment to master. The cabin is top-quality, too, though the third-row seats are best used only by kids. The Black Label version commands a serious price premium over the rest of the Aviator lineup, but it adds lots of exclusive luxury features and premium Lincoln-dealer services.",

      "expert_review": "Unveiled on the auto-show circuit (remember those?) a little over three years ago, the Lincoln Aviator was the first plug-in hybrid from Ford’s luxury brand, though hardly the first plug-in from the automaker itself. Dubbed the Aviator Grand Touring, the SUV’s plug-in version employed a 75-kilowatt electric motor with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and 10-speed automatic transmission for a combined 494 horsepower and 630 pounds-feet of torque. That’s considerably more than the gas-only Aviator (no “Grand Touring” moniker), whose turbo V-6 makes 400 hp and 415 pounds-feet of torque. The mechanicals carry into 2021 unchanged.\n\nRelated: 2020 Lincoln Aviator Plug-In Hybrid First Drive: Still Getting Its Wings\n\nThe Grand Touring is mighty quick, if tentative in its acceleration and braking. But is it efficient after you drain the 13.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack, either by driving the EPA-estimated 21 miles under electric power or farther in hybrid mode? I drove 295 miles to find out.\n\nWith all-wheel drive standard, the Aviator Grand Touring is EPA-rated at 23 mpg combined once the battery pack is depleted. That’s 15% better, at least by rounded EPA figures, than the 20 mpg combined rating for the gas-only Aviator with AWD. (The gas-only SUV also comes with rear-wheel drive, which nabs an EPA-rated 21 mpg combined.) \n\nI began my trip with electric-only range depleted looking to see how the EPA numbers panned out driving the Grand Touring essentially like a hybrid. Although it squanders a key capability for PHEVs, it’s the reality of the ever-popular road trip — and the only way to get an electrified Aviator, as Lincoln offers no plug-free hybrid variant of the SUV. Believe it or not, there are PHEVs on the market that are less efficient than their gas-only counterparts without the help of a charged battery, such as the new Jeep Wrangler 4xe, so it’s not safe to assume any plug-in hybrid is automatically a road-trip champion.\n\nThe Trip\n\nMy two-day trip took me from Chicago’s western suburbs to Port Byron, Ill., in the Quad Cities area along the Illinois-Iowa border.\n\nI began and ended at the same gas station and pump, a journey easily within the Grand Touring’s 439 miles of EPA-rated gasoline range. I topped off the Aviator to begin, and the trip computer read 294.7 accumulated miles when I pulled in a day later to fill back up. The Aviator’s owner’s manual calls for a minimum 87-octane fuel but recommends premium for best performance. In both cases, I topped off with 93 octane.\nConditions ranged from partly cloudy to heavy thunderstorms during the two-day jaunt, with 13 to 16 mph headwinds on the westbound leg out and roughly equal tailwinds on the eastbound leg back, according to readings from Weather Underground. Temperatures ranged from the low 70s to the low 80s throughout.\nI traveled with my two children plus overnight luggage, amounting to some 350 pounds’ total weight. I adjusted tire pressure to manufacturer-recommended settings and kept the Aviator’s windows and moonroof closed. \nThe vast majority of the trip involved interstate highways, with an average vehicle speed of 62 mph and extensive use of the Aviator’s adaptive cruise control. I set the climate control to its fully automatic setting with temperatures between 68 and 72 degrees, which activated a fair amount of air conditioning. \nFinally, I drove as I normally would, neither trying to evaluate the vehicle’s drivetrain (which inevitably dumps mileage) nor drive in a particularly efficient way. Among the various selectable driving modes, I kept the Aviator in Normal.\nThe Results\n\nWhen I pulled back into the station, the Aviator’s trip computer read 23.7 mpg, a tad above the EPA combined rating. The SUV took 13.12 gallons of fuel from the same pump I’d topped off at the day prior, rendering a pump-calculated fuel economy of 22.5 mpg. Averaging the two data points, as is Cars.com’s typical practice during a dedicated mileage drive, gets 23.1 mpg — spot on with the SUV’s EPA numbers on gasoline only.\n\nIf my experience is any indication, achieving the Aviator Grand Touring’s EPA-rated mileage on highway stretches is fairly easy. It shows the SUV in a better light, too: Sustained cruising masks the indecisive transmission and tentative brakes, issues we pointed out in our initial drive in 2019. That said, it raises a new annoyance: Our test car’s lane-centering steering repeatedly warned me to keep my hands on the steering wheel despite them being there. I’ve observed similar tendencies from Cars.com’s long-term Ford F-150, which — like this particular Aviator — has lane centering under an advanced version of Ford’s Co-Pilot360 system.\n\nThe Aviator Grand Touring starts at $70,640. That’s $9,450 more than the Aviator’s similarly equipped Reserve trim with AWD ($61,190). It’s currently eligible for a federal tax credit of $6,534 for plug-in vehicles, which narrows the net gap to just under $3,000. At that, the Grand Touring clearly prioritizes performance over efficiency. If you’re looking for an Aviator geared more toward the latter, stay tuned: Ford reportedly plans to build an all-electric Aviator down the road.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nReport: Ford, Lincoln Planning Future EV Explorer, Aviator, ‘Rugged SUVs’ and More\nLincoln Announces ActiveGlide Hands-Free Driving System, Electric Vehicle Plans\n2021 Lincoln Nautilus: Subtle Changes, Nicer Digs\nSee Where the Aviator Ranks in Cars.com’s American-Made Index\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nThe Lincoln Aviator is a three-row mid-size luxury SUV that competes with a wide range of rivals, including the Genesis GV80, Lexus RX, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. A smooth ride and powerful 400-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 make this Lincoln both a calming and quick place in which to spend your time. The cabin is top-quality, but the third-row seats will be best used only by kids. An available plug-in hybrid version called the Grand Touring churns out 494 hp and an EPA-estimated electric-only range of 21 miles. This model is very expensive, however.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nThere are no major changes to the Aviator for the 2023 model year. A Black Label Special Edition Luxe Package debuts, and the Jet appearance package – which replaces this SUV’s exterior chrome trim with black pieces and adds body-colored trim around the wheels – is now available on Black Label and Reserve trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Lincoln Aviator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nFour USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nTri-zone climate control\n10-speaker audio system\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nQuad-zone climate control\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\n20-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 Lincoln Aviator?\n\nLincoln has a recent habit of delivering luxury SUVs that are not only roomy, quiet and relaxing to drive, but also relatively affordable compared with pricier rivals. The three-row Aviator is no exception: It’s attractive, comfortable and has an infotainment system that takes only a moment to master. Unfortunately, the pricey Grand Touring PHEV loses the plot somehow; it’s powerful, sure, but its ho-hum electric driving range simply isn’t worth its elevated price.",

      "expert_review": "The winding country roads around Yountville, Calif., are some of the most scenic I’ve ever driven, with one postcard-perfect vineyard after another, as well as pine hillside forests and the occasional lake dotting the landscape. That’s unsurprising, as the town sits in the heart of California wine country. But what was surprising was how the new 2020 Lincoln Aviator, a luxury SUV, hustled up and down mountain switchbacks that seemed tailored for performance cars and sport bikes.\n\nRelated: Auto Show Face-Off: 2020 Cadillac XT6 Vs. 2020 Lincoln Aviator\n\nThe Aviator’s handling chops were a pleasant surprise, but the three-row mid-size SUV still exudes luxury in high-end Black Label trim thanks to an elegant, richly appointed interior. At Lincoln’s invitation, we traveled to Northern California to drive gas-powered and plug-in hybrid versions of the Aviator for the first time. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.) Related to the recently redesigned Ford Explorer (Lincoln is Ford’s luxury division), the Aviator is arriving at dealerships now.\n\nEntertaining to Drive\n\nIt’s not one single thing that makes the Aviator a confident backroad carver, but rather a combination of systems — drivetrain, steering, suspension — tuned well and working together.\n\nIt starts with the SUV’s standard 400-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and 10-speed automatic transmission. The Aviator builds speed quickly, and the automatic makes the most of the engine’s considerable power: Shifts are smooth and refined, and the transmission always seemed to be in the right gear for the driving situation.\n\nThe Aviator comes standard with fixed shock absorbers and coil springs, but our test car had the optional Dynamic Handling Package that includes adaptive shocks and air springs, plus adaptive steering. The SUV also has five standard drive modes — Normal, Conserve, Excite, Slippery and Deep Conditions — and Excite, the performance-oriented mode, proved especially useful on our drive route.\n\n2020 Lincoln Aviator | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nIn Normal, the suspension is tuned for comfort. There’s a fair amount of rebound over rises and dips in the road, as well as noticeable body roll in corners. The experience changes completely in Excite; body roll largely disappears as the Aviator hunkers and confidently charges up twisty mountain roads. The whole experience is grin-inducing, which is not the norm in this class.\n\nThe drivetrain gets better in Excite, too, as accelerator responsiveness increases. The steering is precise and weighty, but it lacks road feel.\n\nBlack Label trim levels come with 22-inch wheels and tires that give the SUV a great look, but they seem to counteract one of the typical advantages of an adaptive air suspension: pillowy ride comfort. The 22-inch wheels and low-profile tires give an underlying firmness to the suspension’s forgiving nature; you feel cracks and rough patches in the pavement. Smaller wheels with higher-sidewall tires — a combination that tends to improve ride comfort — are also available, but the Aviator’s air suspension comes exclusively with the 22s.\n\nA Luxurious Yet Confining Interior\n\nThe Aviator competes with mid-size luxury SUVs like the Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90, both of which offer impressive cabin quality. Apart from the Aviator’s door-mounted power seat controls, which look a bit out of place finished in black plastic, the Black Label’s interior is richly finished in soft-touch surfaces and peppered with high-tech features, like a digital instrument panel, widescreen head-up display and 10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system.\n\n2020 Lincoln Aviator | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nOur test vehicle had 30-way power-adjustable front seats that are part of the available Luxury Package. The seats include power-adjustable side bolsters, thigh support, upper backrest angle and head restraint position, to name a few. The seats are supportive, but their narrow design hurts overall comfort; even with their many adjustments, it took me a while to find an acceptable driving position. I’ve been more comfortable in seats with far fewer adjustments, proving once again that more isn’t always better.\n\nLike the front bucket seats, the available second-row captain’s chairs are also on the small side. The chairs slide and recline, but they don’t offer much thigh support, which compromises comfort.\n\nThe Aviator’s two-person third-row seat is even less accommodating for adults. Headroom is decent but legroom is limited, and you sit with your knees uncomfortably elevated. Taller adults could fit back there in a pinch, but it’s really designed for smaller passengers.\n\n2020 Lincoln Aviator | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\nAdvanced Safety Tech\n\nThe Aviator comes standard with important active safety features like forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane keep assist. The available Lincoln Co-Pilot360 Plus Package adds adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane-centering steering, speed-limit sign recognition, rear automatic braking and a self-parking feature.\n\nThe adaptive cruise and lane-centering systems work well, making highway driving less taxing by managing vehicle speed and the Aviator’s position between lane markings. You must remain attentive, however, as the system is quick to alert you if it doesn’t detect a hand on the steering wheel. (Thus far, just Cadillac and BMW offer hands-free driving.)\n\nIn the Market\n\nThe 2020 Aviator starts at $52,195, including a $1,095 destination charge, for a base rear-wheel-drive model. Our well-equipped Black Label model was $83,540, which is around what high-end versions of the Q7 and XC90 cost.\n\nFrom a performance and luxury standpoint, the Black Label Aviator holds its own against those two competitors. First- and second-row seat comfort, however, are its biggest negatives, so be sure to pay extra attention to both if you take the Lincoln for a test drive.\n\n2020 Lincoln Aviator | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
