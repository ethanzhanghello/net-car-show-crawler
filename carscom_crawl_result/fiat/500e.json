      "expert_review": "The Fiat 500e may just be the best electric vehicle on the market right now. It’s certainly the most fun EV since the Tesla Roadster — and if you live in certain California communities, it’s a bargain to boot.\n\nThere are basically two kinds of electric cars: ones that automakers are trying to get the public interested in to show how green they are, and ones that automakers build in order to satisfy local laws. Cars like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt are the first kind: global animals that are as much research tools as commuter cars, designed to be the first wave of a new kind of “clean” transportation. And then there are the second kind, cars like the Toyota RAV4 EV and Chevrolet Spark EV, built thanks to a California regulation that requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of “zero-emissions vehicles” in the state if they want to avoid hefty fines. The new-for-2013 Fiat 500e is one of the latter EVs, something often called a “compliance EV.” It’s currently sold only in California, and the head of Fiat himself has spoken of the car with surprising disdain. This is unfortunate, as the new electric Fiat is a fantastic little car — one of the best small cars I’ve ever driven, electric or otherwise.\n\nMore Than a Power Wheel for Grown-Ups\nStart with a Fiat 500 minicar, remove the engine and transmission, then replace them with a 24-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, an 83-kW electric motor and a single-speed transmission. What that translates into is 111 horsepower and 147 pounds-feet of torque. That’s more than the gas-powered base model’s 101 hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder, but less than the fire-breathing Abarth model’s 160 turbocharged hp. The thing is, those 147 pounds-feet of torque all happen at zero rpm. That means off-the-line acceleration is strong, it feels seriously quick and it’s enough to burn the front tires for a good 5 feet if you turn off the traction control and mash the accelerator. The fact that it weighs 600 pounds more than a base 500 means it’s not likely the quickest of the bunch, but you wouldn’t know that from driving it. With a complete lack of engine noise and a seamless rush of electric grunt, the 500e feels significantly quicker and more powerful than it actually is. This is an astonishingly fun little car, both in spite of and thanks to its electric powertrain.\n\nHandling is another strong point for the 500e. The rear axle is the beefier unit from the Abarth, and staggered-width tires (16 x 5.5 inches up front, 16 x 6.5 inches in back) combine with stiffer springs to make for a tight-handling, electric-go-kart feel. The 500e pushes in corners, understeering due to the considerable weight addition, but handling is truly impressive. The lithium-ion battery pack is flat and sandwiched under the passenger compartment from front to back. Putting that much mass at the lowest point in the car makes it feel planted and remarkably stable. It rides amazingly smoothly for such a short-wheelbase vehicle, soaking up bumps with ease and not disturbing the passenger compartment. At highway speeds, the car is eerily silent; the only sounds are wind rush and tire noise, neither of which is all that loud or intrusive.\n\nThe brakes are strong and incorporate a regenerative mode that is completely undetectable. Most EVs have a special “low” gear setting on the transmission selector that activates more-aggressive regeneration (like “B” on a Toyota Prius or “Low” on a Chevy Volt), but the 500e makes do only with Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive, available through buttons where the gearshift would be. Regeneration occurs when you lift off the throttle and, more energetically, upon light brake application, using the electric motor to slow the vehicle instead of the actual brakes, which blend in seamlessly as you call up more braking force. In other words, it feels just like a normal car — an exceptional accomplishment for an EV, and one that few automakers have been able to duplicate.\n\nFun, But Efficient Too\nPeople generally do not buy EVs because they’re fun but because they’re efficient, because they’re supposedly “greener” than gas-powered vehicles and because they can save money on fuel. The 500e is right up there with the best of them, rated at 116 mpg-equivalent by the EPA. Because nobody understands what MPGe is, however, a better descriptor might be range with a fully charged battery — rated conservatively by Fiat at about 80 miles in mixed use or more than 100 miles in city driving. The EPA rates its range at 87 miles. Over time, I found Fiat’s estimate to be an accurate one. Taking possession of the car with just 21 miles of range left in it (according to the multifunction LCD screen in the gauge display), I drove it home on back roads 17.5 miles — and had 16 miles of range left when I got home to plug it in. As I continued to drive it over the next several days, charging it up again and again, the estimated range began to climb. What started as a maximum of 80 miles of predicted range on a full charge at the start of my test had climbed to 93 miles by the end of it. I have no doubt the car can go 100 miles or more in city driving, when speeds are kept to 60 mph and lower. Range anxiety is fairly minimal, and if you have to go farther than 100 miles, each new Fiat 500e comes with a complimentary voucher for 12 days’ worth of rental cars at Hertz or Enterprise.\n\nRecharging takes just less than four hours on a dedicated 240-volt system, or nearly 24 hours on a standard household 120-volt outlet. The 24-kwh battery is large, bigger than the 16.5 kwh one in a gas/electric Chevy Volt and the same size as the one in the Nissan Leaf. The difference between the Fiat and Nissan, however, is that the Fiat’s battery is liquid cooled and heated, the better to maintain longevity and performance, whereas the Nissan’s is cooled by ambient airflow. Like other EVs, there’s a built-in timer function: Set it to start charging late at night, when electricity rates are cheapest, and you can save even more money.\n\nBut how much does the car itself really save you? At a national average of 12 cents per kwh for electricity, it should cost no more than roughly $3 to fully charge the 500e, and with a 100-mile range, that works out to about 3 cents per mile to operate in the city. Compare that with a base, gas-powered, manual Fiat 500, with its 31 mpg in the city and 10.5-gallon fuel tank: At a national average of $4/gallon, it costs $42 to fill the tank, and you could theoretically go a maximum of 326 miles on it in the city, costing you 13 cents per mile. The EPA says you can save nearly $6,000 in fuel costs over five years, which seems a little optimistic unless fuel prices become dramatically higher, but there is indeed savings to be had.\n\nFun to Drive, Fun to Look At\nThe 500e is something of a caricature, a cartoony little car that exudes playfulness in its styling. Outside, a few styling tweaks give the car away as a 500e: a new front bumper, unique wheels, and orange or white trim colors (depending on the body color you choose) show this isn’t the standard 500 or even the sporty Abarth. The enhancements reportedly improve aerodynamic efficiency by 13 percent overall.\n\nThe same playfulness is found in the interior, which in the 500e can be either dark gray or white, both with orange trim. Leather seats are standard. The dark color is definitely the preferable color choice to my eyes; the white and orange alternative looks a bit too Creamsicle. Controls are all familiar, with only the aforementioned missing shifter standing out as unusual. As in other 500 models, the seats are unusually tall and do not adjust down far enough for anyone taller than 5-foot-11 to fit without their head brushing the headliner; the passenger seat does not adjust for height at all. Those seats are also rather firm and flat — not conducive for aggressive driving. Thankfully, space is tight enough in the 500e that you won’t be rattling around in the interior anyway. The backseat is the perfect place to put people you hate.\n\nAs quirky and fun as the 500e interior is, there is some room for improvement. Seat comfort is one, but the multimedia system is the bigger one. An ancient-looking radio is the only option, and it’s one of the worst systems I’ve tried in a long time. It sounds fine, but its extremely limited function and capabilities are embarrassing, especially for a company that now has access to the industry benchmark Chrysler Uconnect system.\n\nThe rest of the 500e’s electronics are far more impressive. The central round gauge cluster is one big LCD with multifunction options, able to display vehicle status, charge level, driving style (eco-friendly or not), efficiency numbers, and even instant motor-power output. An available remote smartphone app lets you control and monitor the car’s charging. A large lozenge-shaped plastic display on top of the dashboard lights up when the car is plugged in to charge, lighting up any of five bars to show charging progress, like a cellphone. It’s visible from anywhere around the car, and is a great visual confirmation after you’ve plugged the car in.\n\nSafety\nNo crash-test ratings are available for the electric 500e. The normal Fiat 500 scored mixed ratings in both National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests. Buyers worried about driving such a tiny car amid the Chevy Suburbans on American highways should know that the car comes with front, side, curtain and driver’s knee airbags. A rear park assist system and electronic stability control are also standard. See safety specifications listed here.\n\n500e in the Market\nThe question of how much the 500e costs is a tricky one and depends entirely on geography. The sticker price is $32,600, including an $800 destination charge. My test car had an optional $495 eSport Package, which included orange mirrors, a body stripe, 15-inch aluminum wheels and smoked head and taillights for a total of $33,895. There are a few caveats, however: You can only buy this car in California, which is both a good and a bad thing. The 500e qualifies for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit, plus another $2,500 from the California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. If you live in the San Joaquin Valley, you could qualify for another $3,000 rebate as part of that area’s Drive Clean! initiative. Add in Fiat’s own $2,000 incentive currently being offered, and suddenly that $33,895 car has dropped to just less than $19,000, or the price of a nice gas-powered 500 Lounge trim. Of course, this assumes you qualify for all the credits and rebates as well — the federal $7,500 is an income-tax credit, not a rebate, so whether or not to include it in the calculation is up to you. Alternately, you could pick up one of the lease deals Fiat is offering, as well, at $999 down and $199/month for 36 months.\n\nCompeting electric vehicles are more numerous than they once were. In terms of size, the Smart ForTwo ED is the most direct challenger, but is nowhere near as entertaining to drive nor as comparatively spacious. Chevrolet is offering an electric version of its Spark minicar in California, as well, which might be the 500e’s best direct competitor. It’s cheaper than the 500e and has four doors and four seats, similar range and, most interestingly, a whopping 400 pounds-feet of torque right off the line, good for a zero-to-60 time of 7.5 seconds.\n\nIf you’re looking to grab that California carpool-lane permit, the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt should be on your list. Both offer comparable efficiency (albeit it’s more limited with the Volt’s smaller battery and backup gas engine), and considerably more utility with actually usable backseats and superior multimedia systems. With all the California credits thrown in, the Leaf and Volt come out to be similarly priced to the 500e, as well. See how the 500e stacks up against competitors here.\n\nWhen it comes to the fun-to-drive factor, though, no EV short of a $70,000 Tesla Model S even comes close to matching the 500e’s skills.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Fiat 500?\n\nThe two-door, four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model. In addition, the fully electric 500e, which has an EPA-estimated range of 84 miles, is available in a handful of states. All versions have front-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Fiat 500?\n\nThere are no significant changes for 2019.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Fiat 500 Are Most Important?\n\nAll models (except the 500e) offer a choice of a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. All trim levels except the base Pop hatchback also come with rear parking sensors. None are available with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone connectivity, however. Fiat also doesn’t offer any advanced driver-assistance features for the 500.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Fiat 500?\n\nThough the 500 has some appeal as an urban runabout that can dart through traffic and squeeze into small parking spaces, it falls short as a long-distance cruiser. It doesn’t have much backseat or cargo room, either.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nEver since June 2009, when Fiat took a controlling stake in Chrysler, it’s been all but certain the Italian automaker would bring a version of its 500 to the U.S. It finally arrived for 2012. The four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper, Scion iQ and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in California, the fully electric 500e.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500c, 500e, 500 Abarth)\n\nNew for 2014\n\nThe Fiat 500 and 500c get a revised front passenger seat with an armrest and seat-position memory. The seat also sits 1 inch lower for additional headroom.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\n15-inch steel wheels; 15- or 16-inch aluminum wheels available\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\nChrome exhaust tip\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable power sunroof\nAvailable glass roof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nCloth upholstery; leather available\n50/50-split folding backseat\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with stereo and speed controls\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning; automatic air conditioning available\nCD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port; Beats by Dr. Dre premium stereo available\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable TomTom navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nBase 101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nAvailable 135-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder (Turbo)\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nSport-tuned suspension (500 Sport, 500 Turbo)\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety Features\n\n\nSeven airbags\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints\nAvailable rear parking sensors\n\n500c\nThe 500c sports a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\n\n\n101-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nBack to top\n500e\nThe 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop intended for sale initially in California only. Fiat says the car’s range is 87 miles in mixed driving and more than 100 miles in the city.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Fiat 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop for sale in select states. The EPA gives the 500e an 87-mile estimated driving range.\n\nPowering a 111-horsepower electric motor, the thermally managed lithium-ion battery pack can be recharged in less than four hours with a 240-volt Level 2 charging setup (sold separately). On a normal household power outlet, Fiat says it takes less than 24 hours to recharge the battery.\nWhat’s Special\n\nUnique aerodynamic components\nAdditional interior sound insulation\nNavigation system with electric-vehicle-specific features available\nPush-button transmission\n\nHere’s info on the regular 500:\n\nThe two-door, four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in select states, the fully electric 500e. All versions have front-wheel drive.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500c,  500 Abarth)\nNew for 2016\nA new Easy trim level slots between the Pop and Sport models and has a 7-inch digital gauge cluster, Alpine premium audio and 15-inch aluminum wheels. All models have a standard Uconnect multimedia system with a 5-inch touch-screen and Bluetooth connectivity.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nUconnect multimedia system with Bluetooth\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\n50/50-split folding backseat\nCruise control\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n135-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (Turbo)\nPower sunroof\nNavigation system\nAutomatic temperature control\nBeatsAudio premium sound system\n\n500c\nThe 500c has a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\nWhat’s Special\n\n101-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nBack to top\n500 Abarth\nFiat’s performance-oriented Abarth model comes in 500 hatchback and 500c soft-top form, and it competes with sporty models like the Mini Cooper S. Its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp.\nWhat’s Special\n\nDual tailpipes\nFunctional bumper inlets for engine’s two intercoolers\nRear spoiler\nPerformance suspension\nBolstered sport seats\nElectronic stability system with partial-off mode\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper, Scion iQ and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in California, the fully electric 500e.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500c, 500e, 500 Abarth)\nNew for 2015\nMost versions of the 500 get a 7-inch instrument panel screen in place of traditional gauges. Bluetooth streaming audio is now standard, and the restyled center console gains new cupholders and a USB port.  Abarth and Turbo models now offer an available six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe below is a list of highlighted features and not an exhaustive list. Features are standard unless otherwise noted.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n15-inch steel wheels; 15- or 16-inch aluminum wheels available\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\nChrome exhaust tip\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nCloth upholstery; leather available\n50/50-split, folding backseat\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with stereo and speed controls\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning; automatic air conditioning available\nCD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nAvailable 135-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder (Turbo)\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nSport-tuned suspension (500 Sport, 500 Turbo)\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety Features\n\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\nSeven airbags\nActive front head restraints\nAvailable rear parking sensors\n\n500c\nThe 500c has a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\n101-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nBack to top\n\n500e\nThe 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop intended for sale initially in California only. Fiat says the car’s range is 87 miles in mixed driving and more than 100 miles in the city.\n\nPowering a 111-hp electric motor, the thermally managed lithium-ion battery pack can be recharged within four hours when fully depleted by using a 240-volt Level 2 charging setup (sold separately). On a normal household power outlet, Fiat says it takes less than 24 hours to recharge the battery.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nUnique aerodynamic components\nNavigation system with EV-specific features\nPush-button transmission\n\nBack to top\n\n500 Abarth\nFiat’s performance-oriented Abarth model comes in 500 hatchback and 500c soft-top form, and it competes with sporty models like the Mini Cooper S. Its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp and 170 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\n\nDual tailpipes\nFunctional bumper inlets for engine’s two intercoolers\nRear spoiler\n16-inch aluminum wheels; 17-inch rims available\nPerformance suspension\nBolstered sport seats\nElectronic stability system with partial-off mode\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Last decade, Italian brand Fiat introduced the original 500e electric city car as something called a “compliance car.” That means the brand basically did it because it had to — the state of California required a certain percentage of cars sold there to be zero-emissions or else an automaker would face penalties. So Fiat stuffed an electric powertrain into the 2013 500 and mostly sold them in California and Oregon. It turns out owners loved them, as they were small, zippy, fun to drive and came in riotous color schemes. Though production of the original 500e stopped in 2019, they’ve become something of a cult classic in the used-car market, finding their way slowly across the country to places they were never sold.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and Fiat is bringing a new 500e to the U.S. market — but it’s not a compliance car or something cobbled together in haste. No, this new 500e is a fully baked, all-new electric vehicle and is the only version of the 500 being sold worldwide. All 500s are now going to be electric and have been in other countries since Fiat introduced this model nearly four years ago. The pandemic put a delay on reintroducing the car to the U.S., but it is finally arriving in the few remaining Fiat dealerships later this month. But what is it? How is it different from the last one? Is it better? Bigger? More expensive? We recently traveled to Miami for a very brief spin behind the wheel of the new 2024 Fiat 500e (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging for such manufacturer-sponsored events), and while we came away enjoying the little car, we can’t help but think it’s going to be just as hard a sell to American customers as the last 500 was.\n\nRelated: 2024 Fiat 500e Goes Upmarket as Electric Compact Middle Child\n\nBigger Than Before, But Still Very Smol\n\nThe new 500e’s marketing plan is banking on the idea that people are going to think it’s ridiculously cute and trendy. And it undeniably is; the unique face, the standard 17-inch wheels on the base (500e)RED version and the patriotic details, like Italian flags, in the front fender marker lights all look very chic, European and stylish. And the 500e is bigger than before, too — it sits on an all-new platform called the STLA City that’s 2.4-inches longer, 2.4-inches wider and 1.6-inches taller than the last 500e we saw for sale here. The bigger size is noticeable, especially when seeing a new 500e parked next to the last one. The wheelbase has grown a bit too, by just under an inch, and it’s all led to a bigger cabin that’s 2 inches wider and features a backseat that’s easier to get in and out of.\n\nAs Mini brand vehicles continue to get bigger, the 500e truly does feel like the more diminutive European option — it’s available only as a two-door coupe here in the U.S. (but Fiat says it’s considering bringing over the really appealing convertible model next). There’s plenty of room for two up front in the new 500e, with a wide cabin and airy window openings, despite the rather high beltline in the car. The overall shape is tall and round, but for two people using it as a commuter car around town or to and from one’s residence, it works quite well. You can park it just about anywhere, as I proved by navigating the traffic-and-pedestrian-choked streets of Miami, and the style even turned more than a few heads — likely since new 500s haven’t been seen on U.S. roads since before the pandemic.\n\nFiat would also like you to consider the 500e as a premium vehicle, a style and fashion accessory as much as a transportation appliance. As such, it’s going to be marketed in a different way than before, though that isn’t exactly easy to explain. There aren’t typical trim levels for the new 500e. Instead, the base model is the (500e)RED, done in collaboration with (RED), a global charity aimed at eradicating AIDS. Buyers will have only two choices: all-season or summer tires and a Level 2 240-volt charger or public-charging credits. If you want additional safety content, you have to move up to one of the two Inspired By trims: the black-painted Inspired By Music or the rose-gold Inspired By Beauty, both of which also come with additional interior spiffs but no different mechanical gear.\n\nAt odds with the desire to consider the 500e a premium vehicle, however, is an interior completely devoid of soft-touch plastics. It certainly looks stylish and slick, with glossy red touches everywhere, a handy touchscreen, plenty of features and a neat digital gauge cluster, all standard, but it feels cheaper than its price would suggest. The seat fabric feels just okay; the buttons and controls feel good but not premium; and the overall experience leaves you saying “Yeah, this is fine, but I wouldn’t call it special.”\n\nMore Power, More Range, More Refinement\n\nThe new 500e is a front-drive city car powered by a single electric motor putting out a rather slim 117 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. This is a bump from the 111 hp and 147 pounds-feet the prior 500e produced, but the overall weight of the car hasn’t changed much — both the old model and the new one weigh less than 3,000 pounds. But where the old 500e felt sprightly and nimble, the new one feels calmer and more refined. It still has the tight turning circle that a car this small should have, but it doesn’t have anything like a “sport” mode — the three driving modes it does have (Normal, Range and Sherpa) are all meant to extend the driving range of the 500e, not boost its performance potential.\n\nNormal behaves, well … normally, with minimal brake regeneration and very direct throttle tip-in. Range is the one-pedal driving mode, with much more aggressive (but not too aggressive) regen. Sherpa is meant to maximize range, shutting off the climate control and other auxiliary systems and limiting acceleration in order to squeeze every last mile out of the battery. The 500e is lighter than the car it replaces, an amazing feat given its bigger dimensions and much larger battery (42 kilowatt-hours, with about 38 kWh usable, according to Fiat engineers). The 500e’s higher-capacity battery allows for a manufacturer-estimated range of 149 miles (the EPA has not yet released official figures). The old one was rated at 84 miles from its 24-kWh battery, so this is a significant improvement — and if you engage Range or Sherpa mode, that predicted range goes up. I observed as much as 165 miles.\n\nCharging can be done on a Level 1 120-volt plug, taking up to 37 hours to fully charge the car, according to Fiat, but most folks will do it on a Level 2 240-volt system, which enables the car to go from 0%-100% charge in about six hours at 11-kilowatts. The 500e does have DC fast-charging capability, something the old one didn’t have, and it’s claimed to go from 0%-80% (which is odd, as most automakers assume at least a 10% state-of-charge starting point) in 35 minutes at a maximum 85 kW. That’s not particularly quick, but the battery isn’t particularly big — having a faster DC fast-charging rate in a battery this small “would be like filling a balloon with a jet engine,” according to Fiat, with the same kind of predictable results. So the 500e charges decently quickly, but not super quickly and not as quickly as a lot of products we’ve seen from Hyundai and Kia in particular.\n\nPerfect for Somewhere, But Maybe not Here\n\nMy brief drive of the 500e in humid Miami heat with the air conditioning on full blast didn’t do much for allowing predictions on range or charging speed — those will have to come with a full review when the car becomes available for testing at our offices. Overall, however, it’s a comfortable, decidedly quiet, nicely damped little commuter car. Does it have sufficient range and charging speed for U.S. customers? No, likely not. It might be a great little car for European urban dwellers who have plentiful charging infrastructure and don’t drive on highways between cities frequently, but the idea of the American urban dweller picking this over a Tesla Model 3, or even a used Honda Civic hybrid, remains a stretch. Commuting, for many people, fell out of fashion during the pandemic, and people living in crowded American cities often only have street parking, making charging anything difficult.\n\nThe price makes it another challenge — $34,095 (including destination) for the Red, or $37,095 for the Inspired By models with the advanced safety systems and different colors. Being made in Italy and imported, the 500e doesn’t qualify for the federal $7,500 purchase tax credit but will qualify for it in a lease deal (which Fiat is still formulating; more on that when it becomes public). This makes it on the cheap end for EVs right now, but with prices for used Teslas plummeting, picking up a much larger, much longer-range used Model 3 is a viable option for anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive EV.\n\nAnd that’s ultimately going to be the 500e’s overall issue — a compelling reason to get one. If Fiat does bring the cabriolet version to the U.S., that model would be a very rare product — aside from the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, there isn’t another plug-in convertible on the market here. But in coupe form, the 500e doesn’t have the range most Americans feel is necessary, doesn’t charge as quickly as competitively priced alternatives, and it’s not as spacious as those models, either. It has undeniable style and refinement — and lots of neat features — but the idea behind its return to the U.S. feels flawed. Anyone who chooses one over myriad other options really has to specifically want a 500e for its style, size and uniqueness. Choosing one for any other reason doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nItalian Inspiration: 2024 Fiat 500e Inspired by Beauty, Music Special Editions\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2024?\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nResearch the Fiat 500e\nShop for an EV\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Fiat 500e?\n\nFiat’s sole offering in the U.S., the 500e is a subcompact, electric two-door coupe available in a range of curated high-style specifications, many of which are only available in one or two exterior/interior color combinations. Power comes from a 42-kilowatt-hour battery pack and 117-horsepower electric motor that drives the front wheels.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Fiat 500e?\n\nThe 500e relaunched in the U.S. market for 2024. A uniquely trimmed Giorgio Armani Collector’s Edition joins the lineup for ’25. Painted either green or greige, it rides on 17-inch Armani-logo wheels and features a synthetic-leather interior that’s color-matched to the exterior.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Fiat 500e Have?\n\nThe Fiat 500e can travel up to 149 miles on a full charge when fitted with summer performance tires. On all-season tires, range drops to 141 miles.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Fiat 500e?\n\nIts small battery pack means the Fiat 500e is best suited for urban runabout use. Plugged into a 120-volt household outlet, it can replenish its battery from 5% to 100% in 37 hours. On a typical Level 2 charger, it can go from fully depleted to fully charged in around six hours, while a DC fast charger enables it to go from 0% to 80% in about 35 minutes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Fiat 500e Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED exterior lighting\nAutomatic climate control\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nKeyless entry and start\nWireless device charging\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSeven-speaker JBL sound system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nLeather upholstery\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAuto-dimming rearview mirror\nShould I Buy the 2025 Fiat 500e?\n\nIts unique style and practical footprint give the Fiat 500e a unique appeal as a fashion accessory — a fact of which Fiat seems to be acutely aware; the brand’s tagline for the Giorgio Armani Special Edition is “Don’t drive it, wear it.” But the car’s meager power and compact battery mean the 500e is best suited for urban commuter duty. Venture too far outside the city, and its EPA-estimated 149-mile range will start to feel awfully short.",
