      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhat it is: The Fiat 500c has a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\nWhat’s Special\n\n101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nHere’s Info on the Regular 500:\nWhat it is: The two-door, four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper and Smart ForTwo.

      "expert_review": "The idea of a European life suits me well: driving in an edgy, little Italian car though the Italian countryside to find the perfect spot for a picnic of meats, cheeses and olives. Gelato, pasta and fabulous shoes round out the imagery.\n\nThe tiny, fun-to-drive 2012 Fiat 500c fits my imaginary Italian life, even if only in my little south Denver burb. Magnifico!\n\nThe 500c (the c stands for cabrio) has a cloth rooftop that retracts with the push of a button. The car’s pillars stay in place and the cloth top folds like a Roman shade. It’s part convertible and part huge sunroof.\n\nWhile the market of teensy cars is growing at a rapid pace, there are only a few I’d consider to be in direct competition with the Fiat. Well, actually make that one: the Mini Cooper. While the Mini was unique when it first came to the U.S., now every Jane, Dick and Harry owns one, making it much less fun to drive around in than the Fiat, which is new to the U.S. market.\n\nThe affordable four-seater — it has a starting MSRP of $19,500 and my test car, a Pop trim level, rang in at $21,750 — has a softer suspension than the Mini, making it tolerable for slightly longer drives. I still wouldn’t want to road trip in this bambino, but scooting around town in it is a pleasure. The five-speed manual transmission shifted smoothly. The clutch had a good balance; it felt firm without feeling too heavy.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhile driving to brunch one morning in the Fiat, I noticed two Harley-Davidson riders flash the peace sign as they passed each other. Moments later, in the parking lot of my favorite breakfast spot, a Tweety Bird yellow Fiat appeared on the horizon. The yellow Fiat quickly zipped to my Argento silver Fiat’s side of the parking lot, with both the driver and passenger waving at me enthusiastically and frantically. It wasn’t quite a cool peace-sign flash, but it was an equally welcoming greeting to the Fiat club.\n\nClearly, the Fiat 500c looks unique enough to be spotted from the far side of a parking lot. It’s a nearly indescribable mix of small and adorable yet suave and Euro-chic. Its design appeals to me as well as my husband, meaning it’s neither too feminine nor too masculine in the looks department.\n\nThe 500c’s cloth top is great because it allows all the benefits of a convertible without all the pain. You can open it up by pressing the button and get the sun and fresh air streaming in, yet the kids in the back stay shaded. And everyone in the car also remains insulated from too much wind and accompanying wind noise. At low speeds around town it was nearly silent, but driving at more than 45 mph, I had to play around with the roof’s position to limit wind buffeting.\n\nThe trunk is positively adorable. It’s so cute that I finally understand why so many other cultures refer to it as “the boot.” It’s little, but it has enough space for a week’s worth of groceries or two weekend bags. However, the funny lid opens up at just the right height to bang your head on if you’re reaching inside it to get something toward the back.\n\nThe 500c has a 101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder with a five-speed manual transmission that gets an EPA-estimated 30/38 mpg city/highway. A six-speed automatic transmission, which costs $1,000, is available and gets 27/34 mpg. The 500c uses premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe interior of my test Fiat 500c was a little much for me. I loved the Avorio ivory interior accents on the leather steering wheel, leather seating upholstery, and audio and air controls. However, throw in black and silver components to the dash and doors as well as red fabric upholstery and it starts to cross the line from Euro-chic to Euro-trash.\n\nWhile I loved the look of the ivory-colored audio and air controls, they were plasticky and toylike. The sound quality of the optional Bose stereo system, which is part of the Bose Premium Audio Package ($1,250), made up for controls’ cheap feel.\n\nWith such a tiny car, there’s not much space leftover for storage room and compartments. There are two cupholders in the front row, but they’re better used one at a time. Put two Starbucks cups in there at the same time and the lids butt up against one another, making it tough to get one out without the other spilling. There’s a little cubby-like space in front of the cupholders to stash a cellphone or the like, and there are two more cupholders for rear passengers.\n\nThe driver’s seat fit both my hubby and me, but the lack of a telescoping steering wheel mucked up the proportions a bit. It would have been a better fit for me if I could have pulled the steering wheel closer to me.\n\nSmall kids have no trouble climbing into the 500c and wiggling their way into the backseat, if an adult helps to fold the front seats forward. The lever to fold the front seat required a bit of muscle to operate. Once in the back, my kids hated this car. The one and only reason was the head restraints that sit in front of the seatback rather than being flush with it. This caused their heads to lean forward at an unnatural angle. After just a few minutes in the Fiat my daughter asked, “How long do have to keep this one?”\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nMy only real problem with the 500c had to do with the rear head restraints. While my daughters found them uncomfortable, I found them to be frustrating because they’re not removable. Installing a high-back booster seat was a no-go in the 500c. Installing a backless booster seat was an improvement, though the head restraint pushed my daughter’s head forward. Is anyone in the house a chiropractor?\n\nMy daughter was able to buckle her seat belt easily, thanks to the seat belt buckles on stable bases.\n\nI wouldn’t want to install a child-safety seat using the 500c’s lower Latch anchors because they were deeply recessed in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. Our testers did install child-safety seats in the Fiat 500. See the results here.\n\nThe 500c has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, rear parking sensors and seven airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Fiat 500c here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2011 about the 2012 Fiat 500C. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs fortune would have it, the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio came to me for review one year to the day after I handed my vintage Fiat Spider convertible over to its new owner. That’s right: I owned a Fiat, for 11 years. That might make me a Fiat expert. Or possibly just a moron.\n\nUpon the hardtop 500’s introduction, Kelsey Mays published a full review, which allows me to focus on the Cabrio convertible version and give my first impressions of the modern Fiat. See the two body styles compared.\n\nI have my doubts about the 2012 Fiat 500, but I have no doubt about the Cabrio version: It isn’t worth the extra $4,000 you’d pay for it.\n\nNot a True Convertible\nFirst off, the Cabrio isn’t a true convertible. All its pillars are fixed, and the powered soft-top slides back along the roof’s side rails, fan-folding, leaving the glass rear window raised when in its default open position. As you’d expect, occupants aren’t as exposed to the open air as they would be in a full convertible. Pressing the roof button a second time runs the top down between the C-pillars and drops the rear window flat. This opens things up further, but it’s best appreciated by backseat passengers.\n\nTo provide some background, when I briefly drove a hardtop Fiat 500, I struggled with the seating position. The driver’s seat’s bottom cushion has an uptilt in the front that I found uncomfortable, and like most cars nowadays there’s no means of adjusting its tilt. It was particularly problematic because that car was a manual, and the cushion fought back against my leg when I operated the clutch. I’d hoped the automatic Cabrio test car would be more accommodating.\n\nThe 500c’s seat was equally oddly pitched and awkward, and the only way I could achieve marginal comfort was by jacking the seat height lever as high as it would go. Even then, I sat with my arms straight out in front of me because the steering wheel doesn’t telescope and, though it tilts, it doesn’t come down as far as I needed. Having done my best, I then looked up to find the rearview mirror blocking my forward view. Down the seat went, along with whatever concessions the 500 had made for my comfort. I was then sitting with my elbows locked and my arms extended and parallel to the ground. But at least I could see again. Sort of.\n\nEven when the top is raised, the side and rear pillars are quite thick, frustrating attempts to check blind spots over either shoulder. When the roof is lowered to its bottommost position, the folded top sits so high it blocks the rear view, both in the rearview mirror and when looking back directly. Someone of my height (6 feet tall) is arguably in the best position to see over the folded top, but as I explained, I couldn’t sit as high as I wanted to without blocking the forward view.\n\nAs if the problem couldn’t get worse, our test car had an optional navigation system in the form of a portable TomTom, whose cradle mounted into a port atop the dashboard, powering it. I like the idea of portables as factory or dealer options as an alternative to in-dash systems. They’re cheaper ($400 in this case, which includes the integration), they can be shared among other cars, and they’re easily updated or replaced. (Expensive in-dash systems can receive map updates, but the technology itself ages quickly, and the feature consistently depreciates in the used-car market faster than its host vehicle.)\n\nHaving established that … for the love of all that’s holy, did I really need another impediment to seeing out of this car? The TomTom is down low and the rearview mirror is up high, and it feels like the A-Team has plated the car with steel in anticipation of a barrage of gunfire, leaving me just a slot to look through. You’re better off buying a portable navigation unit separately and positioning it someplace reasonable with a suction-cup mount.\n\nDo I Hate This Car?\nLet me interrupt this tirade to express some of the 500c’s positive aspects: It’s small, and I’m a fan of small. (To emphasize, my discomfort in the 500 isn’t about its size; it’s about the lack of two features: a seat-cushion adjustment and a telescoping steering wheel. One of our shorter editors had no complaints.) You can turn a tight circle and park in small spaces, and the higher seating position (visibility issues notwithstanding) makes it easier to navigate tight spaces than it is in the Mini Cooper. Speaking of its main competitor, the 500’s ride is much softer and more livable than the Cooper’s, though I find the Mini’s handling superior. The 500’s higher center of gravity doesn’t give it the Cooper’s grounded dynamics. The Cabrio’s roof-and-pillar structure provide a rigidity you seldom find in a full convertible, but the 500c’s dynamics and limited power make it irrelevant.\n\nOh, right, I was listing the positive. The optional leather in our test car — the higher trim level, called Lounge — was beautiful, elevating and possibly outclassing the entire interior, with which I had other issues … but right now we’re praising.\n\nMany people love the 500’s look. Admirers on sidewalks and in other cars expressed their appreciation. I hesitate to draw long-term conclusions based on this, however, because I’ve witnessed the same phenomenon with lots of cars, and it doesn’t always represent staying power.\n\nCabrio Compromises\nCharacteristic of convertibles, the Cabrio weighs more than the hardtop, but in this case it’s only by 53 pounds — mainly because it’s not a full convertible, so less roof hardware and structural reinforcement is required. All the same, our 500c was none too quick. Being the Lounge trim level, it came standard with a six-speed automatic transmission, which is optional on the base trim level, called Pop. The 500c’s 1.4-liter four-cylinder has its work cut out for it. While the entry-level 500 is no rocket to begin with, the automatic Cabrio Lounge takes more than 11 seconds to hit 60 mph.\n\nEven worse, the transmission shifts harder than I’ve come to expect from a modern, electronically controlled automatic. It behaves a bit better in Sport mode, but that’s mainly because it shifts less frequently, not less harshly, in comparable driving cycles. The more efficient option is the default Drive mode, which delivers an EPA-estimated 27/32 mpg city/highway, sacrificing 2 mpg highway versus the hardtop 500 automatic. The five-speed manual, available in the Pop trim level, provides the same mileage in either body style: 30/38 mpg.\n\nThe Cabrio sacrifices almost no cabin space to the hardtop, with 0.3 inches less front-seat headroom and 0.6 inches less backseat hip room. It even exceeds the hardtop’s backseat headroom by more than an inch, but legroom is far from generous. This also affects how the 500 accommodates child-safety seats.\n\nThe cargo space doesn’t come away unscathed. The Cabrio’s trunk is 5.4 cubic feet, and though it has folding rear seats, like the hardtop, it can’t compare to the 9.5 cubic feet behind the hatchback’s backseat and the usability of a full liftgate.\n\nThe Sum of Its Flaws\nSometimes lots of little problems add up to one big red light, and in time the 500 Cabrio had me seeing red. In addition to my earlier complaints, the audio ports are in the glove compartment. That’s a reasonable place for a USB/iPod connection, but if you use the analog jack, you have to close the door on the cord because there’s no provision for passing it out. The plastic at the center of the steering wheels of both test cars had begun to wear and fog up after too-few months and miles. And I had a heck of a time telling the difference among the three buttons on the keyless remote — not a common problem.\n\nNot ‘Feelin’ It’\nI’m obviously not “feelin’ it” with this car, as the kids say. I’m willing to entertain the possibility that I’m suffering an unlikely collection of personal annoyances with the 500 in general, but I don’t see the Cabrio version’s value for any buyer. It costs $4,000 more than the hardtop for what is essentially a panoramic sunroof. One downside is it doesn’t provide the light of a panoramic glass moonroof unless you open it. The Mini Cooper Convertible does the same trick, opening only a couple of feet, but it can also be lowered completely, like a conventional ragtop. It costs $5,450 more than the base Cooper. In Fiat’s defense, however, the 500 Cabrio is priced the same as the hardtop 2012 Cooper: $19,500. Minis aren’t the affordable runabouts they once were.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had crash-tested the 500 or 500c. Because it retains its roof rails, unlike a real convertible, the Cabrio has side curtain airbags just like the hardtop. There are seven airbags total, the odd one being a driver’s knee airbag. Standard safety features include seven airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nFiat 500 in the Market\nThe Cars.com reviewer’s philosophy is, “You like, you buy.” We help you decide if a car is right for you, and whether anyone else buys it or not is irrelevant. I hope I’ve done that. As a onetime owner of a Fiat from the company’s earlier run at the U.S. market, I’m compelled to register my skepticism about whether the Italian company will make a significant dent this time around, regardless of its association with a resurgent Chrysler Group. In the current market, the allure is unclear.\n\nInternational automotive executives get so caught up in romanticizing iconic cars that sometimes they forget icons are geographically specific. The Volkswagen New Beetle owes much of its success to having been an icon in the U.S. Unlike the original Beetle, the Mini Cooper and Fiat Cinquecento (500) were “people’s car” icons only overseas. Without nostalgia to lean on, cars have to inspire on their own merit.\n\nThe Mini Cooper has done so — first with style and then with a singular drivability. It succeeded in doing what the initially intriguing but terribly flawed Smart ForTwo failed to do: make shoppers into believers during the test drive — shoppers including men who might have seen the Mini as a car for women. Can the Fiat 500 cross that same bridge?\n\nThe 500’s edge over the Cooper is a base price of $15,500, a realm Mini abandoned years ago. But how about the rest of the market? I believe the demand for small, efficient cars is overestimated. But people who do want small cars can now pay less for a subcompact that provides more space than the 500 and has comparable or better gas mileage. The Hyundai Accent hatchback, for example, starts at $14,595 and gets 30/40 mpg.\n\nWhat advantages does that leave a car like the Fiat 500? The ability to park in small spaces? The styling statement? Can these attributes carry a car model? Even here, I have my doubts. The Mini Cooper’s newness has faded, but I still find it cute, like a bulldog. I thought our “Espresso” brown 500c was about as cute as a potato bug. But that’s one man’s opinion.\n\nApart from the never-ending repairs my 1979 Fiat Spider demanded, I’m surprised by how much I miss it. We don’t have a read on the 2012 Fiat 500’s reliability yet, but it must be better than a Spider’s was, even when it was new. That’s good. But now that this latter-day Fiat convertible has left my hands, I don’t miss it at all.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nEver since June 2009, when Fiat took a controlling stake in Chrysler, it’s been all but certain the Italian automaker would bring a version of its 500 to the U.S. It finally arrived for 2012. The four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper, Scion iQ and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in California, the fully electric 500e.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500c, 500e, 500 Abarth)\n\nNew for 2014\n\nThe Fiat 500 and 500c get a revised front passenger seat with an armrest and seat-position memory. The seat also sits 1 inch lower for additional headroom.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\n15-inch steel wheels; 15- or 16-inch aluminum wheels available\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\nChrome exhaust tip\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable power sunroof\nAvailable glass roof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nCloth upholstery; leather available\n50/50-split folding backseat\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with stereo and speed controls\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning; automatic air conditioning available\nCD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port; Beats by Dr. Dre premium stereo available\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable TomTom navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nBase 101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nAvailable 135-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder (Turbo)\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nSport-tuned suspension (500 Sport, 500 Turbo)\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety Features\n\n\nSeven airbags\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints\nAvailable rear parking sensors\n\n500c\nThe 500c sports a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\n\n\n101-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nBack to top\n500e\nThe 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop intended for sale initially in California only. Fiat says the car’s range is 87 miles in mixed driving and more than 100 miles in the city. Powering a 111-hp electric motor, the thermally managed lithium-ion battery pack can be recharged within four hours when fully depleted by using a 240-volt Level 2 charging setup (sold separately). On a normal household power outlet, Fiat says it takes less than 24 hours to recharge the battery.\n\nUnique aerodynamic components\n7-inch screen in instrument panel with EV information\nTomTom navigation system with EV-specific features\nPush-button transmission\n12 days of rental car usage a year, for three years, included\n\nBack to top\n500 Abarth\nFiat’s performance-oriented Abarth model comes in 500 hatchback and 500c soft-top form, and it competes with sporty hatches and convertibles like the Mini Cooper S. Its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp and 170 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nDual tailpipes\nFunctional bumper inlets for engine’s two intercoolers\nRear spoiler\n16-inch aluminum wheels; 17-inch rims available\nPerformance suspension\nBolstered sport seats\nHeavy-duty five-speed manual transmission\nElectronic stability system with partial-off mode\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Fiat 500c has a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\nWhat’s Special\n\n101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nHere’s info on the regular 500:\n\nThe two-door, four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in select states, the fully electric 500e. All versions have front-wheel drive.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500e, 500 Abarth)\nNew for 2016\nA new Easy trim level slots between the Pop and Sport models and has a 7-inch digital gauge cluster, Alpine premium audio and 15-inch aluminum wheels. All models have a standard Uconnect multimedia system with a 5-inch touch-screen and Bluetooth connectivity.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nUconnect multimedia system with Bluetooth\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\n50/50-split folding backseat\nCruise control\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n135-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (Turbo)\nPower sunroof\nNavigation system\nAutomatic temperature control\nBeatsAudio premium sound system\n\n500e\nThe 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop for sale in select states. The EPA gives the 500e an 87-mile estimated driving range.\n\nPowering a 111-hp electric motor, the thermally managed lithium-ion battery pack can be recharged in less than four hours with a 240-volt Level 2 charging setup (sold separately). On a normal household power outlet, Fiat says it takes less than 24 hours to recharge the battery.\nWhat’s Special\n\nUnique aerodynamic components\nAdditional interior sound insulation\nNavigation system with electric-vehicle-specific features available\nPush-button transmission\n\nBack to top\n500 Abarth\nFiat’s performance-oriented Abarth model comes in 500 hatchback and 500c soft-top form, and it competes with sporty models like the Mini Cooper S. Its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp.\nWhat’s Special\n\nDual tailpipes\nFunctional bumper inlets for engine’s two intercoolers\nRear spoiler\nPerformance suspension\nBolstered sport seats\nElectronic stability system with partial-off mode\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Fiat 500?\n  The two-door, four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model. In addition, the fully electric 500e, which has an EPA-estimated range of 84 miles, is available in a handful of states. All versions have front-wheel drive.\n  What’s New on the 2019 Fiat 500?\n  There are no significant changes for 2019.\n  What Features in the 2019 Fiat 500 Are Most Important?\n  All models (except the 500e) offer a choice of a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. All trim levels except the base Pop hatchback also come with rear parking sensors. None are available with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone connectivity, however. Fiat also doesn’t offer any advanced driver-assistance features for the 500.\n  Should I Buy the 2019 Fiat 500?\n  Though the 500 has some appeal as an urban runabout that can dart through traffic and squeeze into small parking spaces, it falls short as a long-distance cruiser. It doesn’t have much backseat or cargo room, either.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Fiat 500 competes with subcompact cars like the Mini Cooper, Scion iQ and Smart ForTwo. A cabrio version, dubbed 500c, is available, and buyers can also opt for a high-performance Abarth model or, in California, the fully electric 500e.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 500c, 500e, 500 Abarth)\nNew for 2015\nMost versions of the 500 get a 7-inch instrument panel screen in place of traditional gauges. Bluetooth streaming audio is now standard, and the restyled center console gains new cupholders and a USB port.  Abarth and Turbo models now offer an available six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe below is a list of highlighted features and not an exhaustive list. Features are standard unless otherwise noted.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n15-inch steel wheels; 15- or 16-inch aluminum wheels available\nPower-adjustable heated side mirrors\nRear spoiler\nChrome exhaust tip\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nCloth upholstery; leather available\n50/50-split, folding backseat\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel with stereo and speed controls\nRemote keyless entry\nAir conditioning; automatic air conditioning available\nCD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n101-horsepower, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nAvailable 135-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder (Turbo)\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nSport-tuned suspension (500 Sport, 500 Turbo)\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety Features\n\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\nSeven airbags\nActive front head restraints\nAvailable rear parking sensors\n\n500c\nThe 500c has a cloth top with various retraction settings, from a sunroof-like ceiling opening to a completely stowed accordion — rear window and all — perched over the trunk. The roof retracts with the touch of a button at speeds up to 60 mph, but unlike in most convertibles, it doesn’t take the side-pillar structure with it. That makes for more of a panoramic moonroof effect than a true droptop experience.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\n101-hp, 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission\nTrunk compartment in place of hardtop’s hatchback cargo area\nHigh-performance Abarth version offered\n\nBack to top\n\n500e\nThe 500e is a battery-electric version of the 500 hardtop intended for sale initially in California only. Fiat says the car’s range is 87 miles in mixed driving and more than 100 miles in the city.\n\nPowering a 111-hp electric motor, the thermally managed lithium-ion battery pack can be recharged within four hours when fully depleted by using a 240-volt Level 2 charging setup (sold separately). On a normal household power outlet, Fiat says it takes less than 24 hours to recharge the battery.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nUnique aerodynamic components\nNavigation system with EV-specific features\nPush-button transmission\n\nBack to top\n\n500 Abarth\nFiat’s performance-oriented Abarth model comes in 500 hatchback and 500c soft-top form, and it competes with sporty models like the Mini Cooper S. Its turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp and 170 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\n\nDual tailpipes\nFunctional bumper inlets for engine’s two intercoolers\nRear spoiler\n16-inch aluminum wheels; 17-inch rims available\nPerformance suspension\nBolstered sport seats\nElectronic stability system with partial-off mode\n\nBack to top",
