      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a five-seat compact luxury sedan that competes against the likes of the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70 and Volvo S60. Working in favor of the C-Class is its strong and efficient 255-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a nine-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive is optional. \n\nYou can also upgrade to one of two available AMG-tuned models, both of which have hotter engines and lots of high-performance hardware. The AMG C43 has a 402-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, while the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the AMG C63 doles out a staggering 671 hp. AWD is standard on AMG models.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nNewly standard on the C-Class are front and rear parking sensors, a wireless charging pad and satellite radio. Mercedes has dropped the coupe and convertible body styles from the C-Class lineup; they’ve been replaced by the new-for-2024 CLE-Class coupe and convertible. On the AMG side, the redesigned C63 debuts as a sedan only, and the C43 sees minor changes in its standard and available equipment after a redesigned sedan-only version debuted last year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nHeated front seats\nThree USB ports\nPanoramic moonroof\nAmbient interior lighting\nDual-zone climate control\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nBlind spot warning\nSafe exit assist\nDriver-monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNavigation\nBurmester audio system\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive cruise control\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nSurround-view parking camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class pushes a lot of the right buttons in terms of driving manners and interior refinement. It looks and feels like a luxury-branded small sedan should, but many rivals deliver a more cohesive package. We found a number of the C-Class’ tech features to be overly complicated, and competing models — such as the BMW 3 Series and Genesis G70 — are simply more enjoyable to drive. Limited rear legroom and a stiff ride when equipped with its available sport suspension don’t help matters.",

      "expert_review": "Just a few model years out from an overhaul that saw its AMG performance variants undergo a tectonic shift, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is little changed for 2025. The luxury sedan’s infotainment system is upgraded to Mercedes’ latest, third-generation MBUX technology, and there’s a new center airbag between the front seats to help reduce injuries from occupants banging into each other.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nFor the performance versions, AMG powertrain engineers found another 14 horsepower in the C43’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, bringing output to 416 hp. And while composite brakes are already standard on the AMG C-Classes, upgraded ceramic-composite rotors with gold calipers are now optional on the top-dog C63 S E Performance.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,150 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nC300: $49,600\nC300 4Matic: $51,600\nAMG C43: $63,650\nAMG C63 S E Performance: $87,200\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level C300 features 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a moonroof, power-operated trunk lid, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and start. Inside are power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging and 64-color ambient lighting. Standard cabin tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and an 11.9-inch touchscreen with voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Rear-wheel drive is standard. The C300 4Matic is identically equipped other than adding all-wheel drive and heated windshield-washer nozzles.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the AMG C43 gains an upgraded suspension with adaptive dampers, larger brakes with silver calipers and a 360-degree camera system in case you want to park yourself. The monster-output AMG C63 adds 19-inch wheels, composite brakes, a panoramic moonroof and a Burmester 3D surround-sound system.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe standard safety suite is relatively basic. Forward collision alert with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, front and rear parking sensors, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams are it — plus the incongruently high-tech automated parking.\n\nBut the Driver Assistance Package, available for a mere $1,950 on every trim level, adds oncoming and front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, automated lane changes, road-sign recognition that can adjust the vehicle’s speed to the current speed limit, and emergency steering assist.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nUnder the hood of the entry-level C300 is a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four making 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. All C-Classes are fitted with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The C300 returns an EPA-rated 25/35/29 mpg city/highway/combined; the 4Matic manages 24/33/27 mpg.\n\nThe AMG C43 also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four, but an electrically driven turbocharger that spools up faster helps it generate 416 hp and 369 pounds-feet; it comes with AWD. The EPA rates the C43 at 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nIn the AMG C63, a larger turbo and 201-hp electric motor on the rear axle vault total output to 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet. Turning that much grunt into forward momentum rather than smoke would be a lot to ask of just two tires, so it also has AWD. The C63 does, however, have a rear-drive Drift mode for buyers with a surplus in their rubber budget. The C63’s 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack is there more to add power than for electric travel, as the car is only capable of traveling about 3 miles before the engine fires up, per Mercedes.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance Review: My, What a Big Turbo You Have\n19 Vehicles Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C300 Review: Losing Its Way\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In addition to sporty styling, the 2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 offers drivers innovative technology derived from Formula One vehicles. Mercedes has revealed pricing for the sports sedan, with the model starting at $61,050 (all pricing includes the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 Brings F1 Tech to the Masses (Who Can Afford a Mercedes)\n\nThe AMG C43’s exterior styling gets several revisions to help it stand out from the rest of the C-Class lineup, including aggressively styled front and rear bumpers, matching side sills, vertical grille slats and dual exhaust tips.\n\nInside, the AMG C43 gets a flat-bottomed AMG steering wheel wrapped in Nappa leather. The newly optional AMG performance seats can be covered in either imitation leather and microfiber or full leather.\n\nThe AMG C43 is available in two trim levels: Premium and Pinnacle. Standard equipment includes an 11.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, heated front seats, a biometric fingerprint scanner, heated windshield wiper fluid, a 360-degree camera, ambient lighting, illuminated door sills, LED adaptive headlights, parallel-parking assist and blind spot monitoring. The Pinnacle trim goes a step further and adds a head-up display, navigation, augmented video for navigation, wireless device charging, enhanced ambient lighting and a Burmester 3D Surround sound system.\n\nPerformance for the 2023 AMG C43 comes from a hand-built 402-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Derived from Mercedes F1 technology, the engine’s turbocharger uses a small electric motor to spool the turbo until exhaust gas is available. The automaker claims this helps reduce turbo lag and improve performance. A nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are both standard, and handling is enhanced thanks to standard rear-wheel steering and the AMG Ride Control suspension with adaptive dampers.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 is on sale now. Full pricing is below.\n\nPremium: $61,050\nPinnacle: $63,850\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Mercedes-AMG C43 Breaks Cover\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C300 Review: Losing Its Way\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Honey, I Shrunk the S-Class\nResearch the Mercedes-AMG C43\nMore Mercedes-Benz News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nA 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and heated front seats are now standard. There’s also a new Night Edition appearance package for the sedan that features black exterior trim, black 19-inch wheels, Night Edition badges, AMG sport seats and an AMG steering wheel.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nPower trunk lid\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n10.25-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking \nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSport suspension and steering \nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHead-up display\nBurmester stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane-centering steering\nRear automatic braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nWhile the C-Class favors comfort over driving performance, it’s still a poised and powerful compact luxury car. Interior luxury is a highlight, as is the car’s multimedia system. We also like the range of available body styles and engines. We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Less than a month after Mercedes-Benz unveiled its refreshed-for-2019 C300 sedan, the luxury brand carted out its speedier sibling: the AMG C43, a car in the C300’s vein, with more power and mild styling updates. The C43 debuts at this week’s 2018 Geneva International Motor Show and hits U.S. dealers by year’s end.\n\nRelated: More 2018 Geneva Motor Show News\n\nFirst, performance: Thanks to larger turbochargers, the C43’s turbo 3.0-liter V-6 now makes 385 horsepower, up from 362 hp. Torque remains unchanged, at 384 pounds-feet, but it peaks a little higher on the tach — now 2,500-5,000 rpm rather than the previous 2,000-4,200 rpm. Power hits the ground through a nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-biased all-wheel drive, and Mercedes estimates the same 4.6-second zero-to-60-mph time as the outgoing C43. Adaptive shock absorbers are standard.\n\nSimilar to sportier versions of the C300, the C43 gets taller bumper openings with double crossbars on the outer portions. An updated AMG styling package on the 2019 C300 has the same single-crossbar grille that Mercedes previously reserved for the C43 and C63, so the C43 bumps up to the split-louver appearance from the C63. In back, the C43 adds a larger bumper diffuser plus circular, quad tailpipes that split out from each other versus last year’s consolidated design — both nods to the C63. Mercedes says the changes give the C43 “even more distinct positioning,” but if you fancied the prior C43’s sleeper styling, it went the way of the dodo.\n\nSpeaking of the ’63, Mercedes has yet to reveal updates on the C-Class’ head honcho — much less the nameplate’s coupe and convertible body styles — but it’s a safe bet this refresh will grace other variants in the next model year or two.\n\nInside, the C43 gets similar updates to the C300. A 10.25-inch dashboard display replaces last year’s 7- or 8.4-inch units. Optional virtual gauges measure 12.3 inches, and they’re housed in the extant gauge portals — not on a tabletlike screen à la the E-Class and S-Class. A new steering wheel sports updated controls similar to that of other recent Mercedes redesigns, from the G-Class to the CLS-Class. Optional AMG Performance seats add heating and ventilation, from the previous heating only.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class compact luxury car is available as a sedan, coupe or convertible. The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C 43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C 63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nBlind spot warning, keyless access and a hands-free trunk lid are standard. The coupe and convertible also gain a Burmester premium stereo.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a 10.25-inch multimedia screen, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Available features include a digital instrument panel, navigation, a head-up display, wireless charging, three-zone automatic air conditioning, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a driver-drowsiness monitor. Available features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-keeping assist and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nWhile the C-Class favors comfort over driving performance, it’s still a poised and powerful compact luxury car. Interior luxury is a highlight, as is the car’s multimedia system. We also like the range of available body styles and engines. We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",
