      "expert_review": "While sales of some SUVs are suffering — Ford’s Excursion and Explorer and Chevrolet’s Suburban, for example — the market for high-end luxury SUVs remains strong despite their appetite for gas and prices that can easily top $60,000.\n\nTake, for example, today’s test car, the 2007 Mercedes-Benz GL450.\n\nIt’s not as if the world really needed another big SUV, but Mercedes-Benz certainly needed to produce one. The loyal owners of other Benz models were looking elsewhere when they went in search of heft and hauteur.\n\nEven owners of the company’s M-Class cars were leaving the brand to pay lots of money for someone else’s luxury behemoth SUV.\n\nPorsche, known for its sports cars, drove down this road in 2002 and its Cayenne line, arguably, saved the company from takeover by virtually doubling Porsche’s overall sales.\n\nSo what’s the GL-Class have to offer that will keep Mercedes owners from leaving the family?\n\nLuxury, power, smoothness, and capability — at a price that ranges from a base level of around $56,000 to about $70,000.\n\nYou can put as many as seven people into the GL450, which is the proper way to use an SUV as opposed to the yahoos who commute to work by themselves in big rigs every day.\n\nThe GL450 can tow up to 7,500 pounds, enough to handle a decent sized boat or horse trailer. Again, it’s the kind of use SUVs were intended for, and Mercedes makes it easy.\n\nYou can get a drive train that features off-road capacity such as a two-speed transfer case, locking center, and rear differentials, and an advanced air suspension system that can provide about 12 inches of ground clearance to avoid rocks, or double that if you have to travel through deep water.\n\nYet, with a 200.3-inch overall length and a weight of more than 2 1/2 tons, who would really consider doing heavy off-roading in this rig?\n\nThe car is at its best with a base drive train that will get it to the ski lodge, the trout stream, the deer stand, or the Hamptons or Nantucket.\n\nOf course, even on smooth roads, it’s all about moving ahead, and that’s where the GL450 shows off its best features.\n\nThe 4.6-liter V-8 engine puts at your disposal 335 horsepower and 339 lb.-ft. of torque — that’s more horsepower and torque than almost any driver will ever need or should use.\n\nAnd best of all, the power is transmitted to what is becoming my favorite non race track transmission on the planet, a seven-speed automatic that says, simply, “Don’t worry, I’ll get you there and you won’t hear a thing from me.”\n\nMercedes lumps critical safety features as standard fare into the GL450, including traction control, adaptive front air bags, seat mounted side air bags for the first two rows, and window curtain bags in all three rows.\n\nLeather, bird’s-eye maple, and heated power front seats help define the interior elegance, while the outside looks like your basic big SUV.\n\nIf you want to spend some extra money (and Mercedes is happy to accommodate), options include Bi-Xenon headlamps, corner “seeing” fog lamps, an upgraded Harman Kardon sound system with 11 speakers, three-zone air conditioning, a power tailgate, heated second-row seats, and a navigation system.\n\nDo this dance and the base car price can quickly escalate to around $70,000, as did the base car we tested.\n\nBut what’s a few thousand dollars more when you’re already traveling in the high-end lane?\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2008 about the 2009 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith a 23-mpg diesel version now available in all 50 states, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a more viable option for SUV-needing families — though the appeal of a $60,000-plus four-wheeler seems limited in today’s economy. Even if you are in the market, the GL remains a debatable choice: stylish on the outside and elegant within, but hamstrung by spotty reliability and a drivetrain as indecisive as the North Carolina electorate.\n\nStill, that’s more praise than I can give last year’s model, whose review serves as the basis for this update; its dated navigation system was onerous to sort through, but it’s been vastly improved for 2009. The SUV also gets more high-tech safety features, though they might just be gilding the lily on a model that already had nine standard airbags and an electronic stability system.\n\nTrim levels include the diesel GL320 Bluetec and gasoline GL450 and GL550; click here to compare them or here to compare the whole group to its ’08 equivalents. I drove a 2009 GL320 Bluetec, and I’ve also driven a 2008 GL550.\n\nMuscular Moves, Eventually\nThe turbo-diesel GL320 Bluetec has additional exhaust treatments to cut soot and nitrogen oxide emissions — technology last year’s diesel GL320 CDI lacked, which is why California and several Northeastern states wouldn’t sell it. The new diesel six-cylinder performs like most diesels of its kind: burly and full of grunt early on, but loathe to produce much more power when you rev high. Indeed, it has more torque than the V-8 GL550, and it puts it all on the plate at just 1,400 rpm. Accessing that power is harder than it sounds, though, as the Bluetec is plagued by a bad case of accelerator lag, and its seven-speed automatic isn’t particularly responsive. Put together, it takes a patient right foot to nurse the proper acceleration out of the beast; prod the pedal hard, and the response is tepid at first, but after a second or so it’s probably more than you asked for.\n\nThough I didn’t drive the V-8 GL450, Mercedes quotes a 7.4-second zero-to-60 mph time, which is impressive for something that weighs nearly as much as a Chevy Tahoe. The GL550 is the lineup’s hardest hitter: It uses Mercedes’ 5.5-liter V-8, a thoroughly modern engine shared with some of the brand’s best models. The engine’s wide power band propels the GL to freeway speeds with ease, and the automatic transmission feels better groomed for this application, downshifting two or three gears at a time for quick, confident bursts of power.\n\nAlas, accelerator lag still rears its head. It isn’t apparent during stop-and-go driving, but a sudden call for power — escaping a slow-moving freeway lane, for example — is sometimes met with a lazy response. I try to tolerate some lag, as it’s often a byproduct of the electronic throttles that most cars, including the GL, employ these days. What frustrates me is inconsistent response, and that’s what the GL exhibits. Sometimes the gas pedal is virtually lag-free, while other times it takes half a second or longer to summon the appropriate oomph.\n\nAntilock brakes with discs at all wheels are standard. The pedal delivers strong response, but it’s a bit touchy when you lift back off, so smooth stops may take practice.\n\nRunning the Numbers\nThanks to diesel engines’ higher efficiency, the Bluetec achieves nearly the same EPA ratings as a Cadillac Escalade Hybrid. The figures are 27 percent better overall than those of the gas GL450, though the latter model has a V-8 versus the Bluetec’s V-6, so this isn’t necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison. This year’s Bluetec is also 1 mpg worse than last year’s GL320 CDI. Mercedes spokesman Rob Moran said that’s due to this year’s larger wheels — 20-inchers versus 18s, which introduce “quite a bit more rolling resistance.” In real-world driving, Moran claims the differences are slighter than the EPA ratings suggest. Here’s how the engines compare:\n\nEngines Compared\n \tGL320 Bluetec\tGL450\tGL550\nEngine\t3.0-liter V-6\t4.7-liter V-8\t5.5-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t210 @ 3,800\t335 @ 6,000\t382 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t398 @ 1,600 – 2,400\t339 @ 2,700 – 5,000\t391 @ 2,800 – 4,800\nEPA gas mileage (mpg, city/hwy)\t17/23\t13/18\t13/17\nDriveline\tAWD\tAWD\tAWD\nTransmission\t7-speed auto\t7-speed auto\t7-speed auto\nZero to 60 mph (sec.)\t9.1\t7.4\t6.4*\nRequired fuel\tDiesel\tPremium gas\tPremium gas\n*Mechanically identical 2008 GL550; 2009 GL550 acceleration figures were unavailable as of publication. All other figures come from automaker and EPA data for 2009 models.\n\nDue in large part to supply-and-demand issues, diesel fuel was 68 cents more per gallon than premium unleaded — $3.19 versus $2.51, according to AAA’s national averages as of Nov. 6. Unfortunately, that almost exactly cancels out the mileage advantage. To neutralize emissions, the Bluetec system uses a liquid solution that Mercedes calls AdBlue, a term far more marketable than the stuff’s trade name, urea. The AdBlue reservoir needs to be refilled every 10,000 miles or so, something Mercedes bundles into routine dealer maintenance. I called a few dealerships to see if the procedure affects the cost of such maintenance; a dealership near New York said AdBlue costs extra but wouldn’t say how much. A dealership in Los Angeles said it does not cost extra, while one in Chicago quoted me $32 per AdBlue refill. Be sure to ask your salesperson for an exact estimate and hold the dealership to his or her quote.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe GL has a unibody frame — rare among full-size SUVs — and its four-wheel-independent air suspension swaps traditional coil springs for inflatable air bladders. Ride height can be varied to enhance high-speed stability or offroad ground clearance. An optional adaptive suspension constantly adjusts ride stiffness as conditions require, with Sport and Comfort modes that yield, respectively, stiffer or softer response. There’s also an Auto mode that calibrates the settings somewhere between those two based on conditions. Both the GL550 and GL320 I drove had the system, and I’ll attest that Sport mode resists body roll marginally better than Comfort, but the differences are slight.\n\nMore consequential are the GL550’s 21-inch alloy wheels and sporty P295/40R21 tires, which combine with unusually precise steering to make curvy roads a bit of fun. There’s still enough power assist at lower speeds for tight parking-lot maneuvers, though at times I found lumpy pockets of resistance while navigating our downtown parking garage. That’s a noticeable difference from the steering wheel’s confident, planted feeling on the highway.\n\nNaturally, fun comes at a price. The GL550’s advanced suspension can’t make up for the brittle ride quality of its thin 40-series tires. You’ll hear and feel every highway expansion joint, and potholes and speed bumps become a jarring, noisy experience. Most annoying was the abundance of suspension reverberation I felt around Chicago’s roughed-up streets: No matter what setting I had the suspension on, major bumps sent palpable motions through the entire chassis for a half-second or more.\n\nOn smoother roads — that’s you, Governator State — the ride feels more agreeable. Tire noise is still noticeable, but wind noise is minimal and the engine is nearly silent. The GL320’s 20-inchers and P275/50R20s yield better ride comfort still, though the GL450, which has 18-inch wheels and P265/60R18 tires, is probably the most forgiving of the three.\n\nAt 39.7 feet, the GL’s turning circle is competitive with its peers.\n\nExterior & Styling\nParticularly from the rear, the GL’s appearance looks a bit like Mercedes’ original M-Class — so much so that a passenger walked up to an older M thinking it was the GL. The GL550’s 21-inch wheels, oversized grille and rubber-studded running boards give it a look similar to that of Mercedes’ AMG performance cars — perhaps that was the intention, given there is no AMG GL-Class — and should secure the car a front-row spot at most valet stands. Lesser models can be dressed to match, albeit with a smaller grille.\n\nLess-expensive GLs have 18- or 19-inch wheels. An optional offroad package raises the air suspension to yield 12 inches of ground clearance, 2 inches higher than a Hummer H2’s. The package also includes a two-speed transfer case and locking center and rear differentials.\n\nCabin Quality\nIf the cockpit in a Cadillac Escalade or Infiniti QX56 feels like a roomy lounge, the GL550’s cabin is eminently more carlike. Don’t expect massive armrests and a tall dashboard — rather, the wraparound dash and narrower seats could pass for those in a luxury sedan. Quality is good: Upper portions of the dashboard come wrapped in leather, and wood and chrome inlays effectively offset the lower panels. Nearly every surface is soft to the touch, including areas the driver’s and front passenger’s knees might knock against. Fit and finish is respectable, save an unsightly gap around the glove compartment. A more ergonomic steering wheel has replaced last year’s ill-fitted one, whose audio controls were too easy to press by accident.\n\nThe center controls look and feel high-quality, and it’s nice to see Mercedes has stuck with black plastic where other carmakers have painted theirs a tacky-looking silver. The navigation system has also been enormously improved over its predecessor, with the latest rendition of Mercedes’ Comand interface. Gone are last year’s tacky graphics and annoying smart-key interface; now there’s a handy directional keypad with shortcut keys to zoom in or out or go back a screen. The graphics, too, are first-rate.\n\nBlind-spot visibility is generally good, but most Cars.com staffers who drove the GL thought the tiny side mirrors were a joke.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nThe front seats have a litany of power adjustments, including optional side-bolster adjustments. Even with the bolsters and lumbar support dialed all the way back, I found the seats stiff. That’s typical in German cars, but in a large SUV I prefer cushier seats. The GL has the kind of seats that hold you in place during spirited driving; expert road manners notwithstanding, I’m not sure many GL-Class drivers are going to carve corners.\n\nI compared seating in a GL-Class, QX56, Escalade and Lexus LX 570 at an auto show, and the front seats of all three competitors suited me better than the GL’s. Second-row space in the GL seems on par with the competition — I’m about 6 feet tall, and I had no complaints — but it’s the third row that shines. Legroom and headroom in the GL are leagues better than in the others, and the GL’s seats sit high enough that passengers aren’t staring at their knees. The Lincoln Navigator is perhaps the only competitor that has as much third-row room. As craftsmanship goes, there is no competition: The GL’s third row boasts reading lights, overhead A/C vents, a fixed skylight and leather-wrapped armrests. It puts the other SUVs’ third-row décor to shame.\n\nAll trim levels have a power-folding 50/50-split third row. It folds more or less flat, as does the second row, and the resulting load floor is free of any major gaps. Maximum cargo volume is 83.3 cubic feet, which considerably trails some of the GL’s boxiest competitors.\n\nCargo Volume Compared\n \tMax. seats\tBehind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\tBehind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\tBehind 1st row (cu. ft.)\nMercedes GL-Class\t7\t14.3\t43.8\t83.3\nLexus LX 570\t7\t15.5\t41.0\t83.1\nCadillac Escalade*\t7\t16.9\t60.3\t108.9\nLincoln Navigator*\t7\t18.2\t54.5\t103.3\nInfiniti QX56\t7\t20.0\t56.7\t97.1\n*Regular-length models.\nSource: Automaker data for 2009 models.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not yet crash-tested the GL-Class. The nine standard airbags include three-row side curtain airbags, a driver’s knee airbag and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the first and second rows. Active head restraints, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nNewly standard for 2009 is Mercedes’ Pre-Safe system, which uses sensors in the braking and stability systems to intuit a likely collision. It then cinches up the seat belts, closes any open windows to minimize intrusions and adjusts the seats for maximum airbag effectiveness. Though in most cases there won’t be enough time to fully perform those actions, Mercedes’ Moran said, “the thinking there is that anything is better than nothing … even if the window was down halfway and it got up three-quarters of the way, it would be better.”\n\nWith Latch child-seat anchors for the outboard second- and third-row seats, don’t be surprised if you’re drafted to schlep the entire neighborhood’s tots to day care. The second row has top-tether anchors for all three seats, and they’re conveniently mounted midway down the back of the seats. Parents should note that all the anchors have removable plastic covers. They’re a pain in the neck to pry off, so here’s betting you’ll leave them off — and lose them.\n\nPoor reliability continues to be the GL’s biggest drawback. In its first two years on the market, the SUV earned the worst possible score, Much Worse Than Average, from Consumer Reports. The publication cited body hardware as the GL’s biggest trouble spot. I’d be more concerned if large luxury SUVs weren’t generally such a reliability letdown; the Escalade earned dismal reliability scores, and although Consumer Reports didn’t have sufficient data to rate the Range Rover in 2008, the SUV got poor ratings in prior years. The QX56 and Navigator are relative bright spots, with reliability ratings of Average. The recently redesigned LX 570 hasn’t been on the market long enough to gauge.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nExcluding the destination charge, the GL320 Bluetec starts at $58,200, while the GL450 starts at $59,200. Both represent $3,000-plus increases over last year’s prices, though larger standard wheels on the Bluetec and additional standard features — among them a six-CD changer and a moonroof — mitigate this a bit. Other standard features include four-wheel drive, faux leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, a fixed third-row skylight and heated power front seats. The GL550 hikes the price considerably ($81,300) but comes standard with leather upholstery, keyless access with push-button start, a backup camera, heated second-row seats, Harman Kardon audio, xenon headlights and a navigation system. Many of those features are optional on lesser trims.\n\nGL550 options include a rear-seat DVD system, upgraded leather and ventilated front seats. Fully loaded, the GL-Class tops out around $87,000.\n\nGL-Class in the Market\nThe GL’s price spread gives it a wide range of competitors. At the low end it competes with Infiniti and Lincoln, and at the high end there’s Lexus and Land Rover. Though sales are down these days, the GL hasn’t tanked as fast as the rest of Mercedes’ lineup, which is tracking about even with the auto industry’s general decline.\n\nThe GL is doing better than it should, and I can see why: The Bluetec’s national availability coincides with a dramatic decline in gas prices, which should go a long way toward sweetening the prospect of buying a large luxury SUV. Indeed, there are enough strengths to make the GL a worthy steed for some, but until Mercedes irons out the drivetrain kinks — and improves the reliability — I can’t recommend it for everyone.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Last year, Mercedes-Benz introduced the seven-seat GL-Class, an SUV that will inevitably find its way into the sort of neighborhoods where one Banana Republic just isn’t enough. For 2008, Mercedes has added a rip-roaring GL550, whose steep price tag moves the lineup (which also includes the GL450 and diesel GL320 CDI) into Range Rover territory.\n\nI spent a week ripping and roaring in a GL550, and my conclusions are mixed. The SUV’s inconsistent acceleration obstructs an otherwise impressive driving experience, and issues with visibility and control usability sour the well-tailored cabin. Most troubling, though, is the GL’s poor reliability record, which is tempered only by the fact that its competitors don’t fare much better. The Benz has enough strengths that it might prove a worthy family-hauler, but be sure to consider its limitations before you buy.\n\n \n\nMuscular Moves\nShortly after last year’s GL450 arrived, Mercedes-Benz introduced a diesel GL320 CDI; click here to compare the 2008 GL-Class with the 2007 model. Thanks to the higher efficiency of its diesel engine, the CDI’s mileage is considerably better than its V-8 gas siblings, but because of stricter emissions standards the diesel isn’t available in California and several northeastern states. (For 2009, a cleaner GL320 Bluetec version will be available nationwide.) All GL-Class models include full-time four-wheel drive. Here’s how the engines compare:\n\nEngines Compared\n \tGL320 CDI\tGL450\tGL550\nEngine\t3.0-liter V-6\t4.6-liter V-8\t5.5-liter V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t215 @ 3,800\t335 @ 6,000\t382 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t398 @ 1,600 — 2,800\t339 @ 2,700 — 5,000\t391 @ 2,800 — 4,800\nGas mileage (mpg, city/hwy.)\t18/24\t13/18\t13/17\nRequired fuel\tDiesel\tPremium gas\tPremium gas\nSource: Automaker data for 2008 models.\n\n \n\nThe GL550’s 5.5-liter V-8 sees duty across a number of other Mercedes-Benz models. It’s a powerful engine, mustering enough torque to propel the SUV to freeway speeds with ease. A seven-speed automatic is the standard transmission for all engines. Gear hunting is minimal, and downshifts can come two or three gears at a time — from sixth to third, for example. The resulting shorter ratios for each gear allow quick, confident bursts of power.\n\nUnfortunately, starting out can be troublesome. A few days into my test drive, I began to notice some significant accelerator lag. It wasn’t apparent during stop-and-go driving, but a sudden need for power — escaping from a slow-moving freeway lane, for example — was sometimes met with a lazy response. I try to tolerate some accelerator lag, as it’s largely a byproduct of the electronic throttles that most cars, including the GL, employ these days. What frustrates me is inconsistent response, and that’s what this SUV exhibits. Sometimes the gas pedal proved virtually lag-free, while other times it took a half-second or longer to summon the appropriate acceleration. Mercedes-Benz spokesman Rob Moran said the way Mercedes tunes its accelerators — which generally require more pressure than a typical car’s — might have something to do with it.\n\nAntilock brakes with discs at all wheels are standard. The pedal delivers strong response, but it’s a bit touchy when you lift back off, so smooth stops may take practice.\n\n \n\nRide & Handling\nThe Mercedes-Benz GL-class has a unibody frame — rare among full-size SUVs — and its four-wheel-independent air suspension swaps traditional coil springs for inflatable air bladders. Its ride height can be varied to enhance high-speed stability or offroad ground clearance. An optional adaptive suspension constantly adjusts ride stiffness as conditions require. My test car came equipped with the system, which, combined with its 21-inch wheels and sporty P295/40R21 tires, resisted body roll admirably.\n\nLike many adaptive suspensions, the GL550’s has Sport and Comfort modes that yield stiffer or softer response, respectively. There’s also an Auto mode that calibrates the settings somewhere between those two. Sport mode resists body roll marginally better than Comfort, but the difference is slight. On the highway, the differences are all but unnoticeable.\n\nThe steering wheel’s precise turn-in makes curvy roads a pleasure to drive. There’s enough power assist at lower speeds for tight parking-lot maneuvers, though at times I found lumpy pockets of resistance while navigating our downtown parking garage. It’s a noticeable difference from the steering response at higher speeds, which is smooth and confidence-inspiring.\n\nAlas, the GL550’s advanced suspension can’t make up for the brittle ride quality of its thin 40-series tires. You’ll hear and feel every highway expansion joint, while potholes and speed bumps become a jarring, noisy experience. Most annoying was the abundance of suspension reverberation I felt around Chicago’s roughed-up streets: No matter what setting I had it on, major bumps sent palpable motions through the entire chassis for a half-second or more.\n\nOn smoother roads — that’s you, California — the ride feels more agreeable. Tire noise is still noticeable, but wind noise is minimal and the engine is nearly silent. I can only presume that the GL320 and GL430, with their 18-inch wheels and thicker P265/60R18 tires, would be more comfortable on bumpy roads, but be sure to compare them on your test drive.\n\nAt 39.7 feet, the GL’s turning circle is competitive with its peers.\n\nExterior & Styling\nParticularly from the rear, the GL’s appearance looks a bit like Mercedes’ original M-Class. The 21-inch wheels, oversized grille and chrome running boards on my test car gave it a look similar to that of Mercedes’ AMG performance cars — perhaps that was the intention, given that there is no AMG GL-Class — and should secure the car a front-row spot at most valet stands.\n\nLess-expensive GLs have 18- or 19-inch wheels. An optional offroad package on the GL450 raises the air suspension to yield 12 inches of ground clearance — some 2 inches higher than a Hummer H2’s. The package also has a two-speed transfer case and locking center and rear differentials.\n\nCabin Quality\nIf the cockpit in a Cadillac Escalade or Infiniti QX56 feels like a roomy lounge, the GL550’s cabin is eminently more carlike. Don’t expect massive armrests and a tall dashboard — rather, the wraparound dash and narrower seats could pass for those in a luxury sedan. The quality is good: Upper portions of the dashboard come wrapped in leather, and wood and chrome inlays effectively offset the lower panels. Nearly every surface is soft to the touch, including areas the driver’s and front passenger’s knees might knock against. Nice. Fit and finish is respectable, save for two unsightly gaps: one around the glove compartment, the other bordering the steering wheel hub.\n\nThe center controls look and feel high-quality, and it’s nice to see Mercedes-Benz has stuck with black plastic where other carmakers have painted theirs tacky-looking silver. I’m not as keen on the navigation system. It uses Mercedes’ Comand interface, which has proved handy in other Benzes I’ve driven, but this is an earlier generation with second-rate graphics, and it has to be used with tiny buttons alongside the screen. Good news: The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class offers an updated system that doesn’t use those buttons; I checked it out in an ’09 GL320 Bluetec at an auto show, and it’s a major improvement.\n\n\nBlind-spot visibility is generally good, but most Cars.com staffers who drove the GL thought the tiny side mirrors were a joke.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nThe GL550’s front seats have a litany of power adjustments, including adjustable stiffness for the side bolsters. Even with the bolsters and lumbar support dialed all the way back, the seats are too stiff. That’s typical in German cars, but in a large SUV I prefer cushier seats. These hold you in place during spirited driving; expert road manners notwithstanding, I’m not sure many GL-Class drivers are going to carve corners.\n\nI compared seating in a Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, QX56, Escalade and Lexus LX 570 at an auto show, and the car-like front seats of all three competitors suited me better. Second-row space in the GL550 seems on par with the competition — I’m about 6 feet tall, and I had no complaints — but it’s the third row that shines. Legroom and headroom are leagues better than the others’, and the GL’s seats sit high enough that passengers aren’t watching their knees. The Lincoln Navigator is perhaps the only competitor that has as much third-row roominess. As craftsmanship goes, there is no competition: The GL550’s third row seating boasts reading lights, overhead A/C vents, a fixed skylight and leather-wrapped armrests. It puts third-row décor in the other SUVs to shame.\n\n\nAll trim levels have a power-folding 50/50-split third row. It folds more or less flat, as does the second row, and the resulting load floor is free of any major gaps. Maximum cargo volume is 83.3 cubic feet, which considerably trails some of the GL’s boxiest competitors.\n\nCargo Volume Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tMax. seats\tBehind 3rd row\tBehind 2nd row\tBehind 1st row\nMercedes-Benz GL-Class\t7\t14.3\t43.8\t83.3\nCadillac Escalade*\t8\t16.9\t60.3\t108.9\nLexus LX 570\t8\t15.5\t41.0\t83.1\nLincoln Navigator*\t8\t18.2\t54.5\t103.5\nInfiniti QX56\t8\t20.0\t56.7\t97.1\n*Regular-length models.\nSource: Automaker data for 2008 models.\n\n \n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet crash-tested the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. Eight standard airbags include three-row side curtain airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the first and second rows. Active head restraints, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\n\nWith Latch child-seat anchors for the outboard second- and third-row seats, don’t be surprised if you’re drafted to schlep the entire neighborhood’s tots to daycare. The second row has top-tether anchors for all three seats, and they’re conveniently mounted midway down the back of the seats. Parents should note that all the anchors have removable plastic covers. They’re a pain in the neck to pry off, so here’s betting you’ll leave them off — and lose them over time.\n\nPoor reliability is the GL’s biggest drawback. In its first year on the market, the SUV earned the worst possible score, Much Worse Than Average, from Consumer Reports. The publication cited power accessories as the GL’s biggest trouble spot. I’d be more concerned if large luxury SUVs weren’t generally such a reliability abyss; the Escalade earned dismal CR scores, and although the publication didn’t have sufficient data to rate the Range Rover or QX56 in 2007, both SUVs scored poorly in prior years. The Navigator is the one bright spot, with a CR rating of Better Than Average. The redesigned LX 570 hasn’t been on the market long enough to gauge.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nExcluding the destination charge, the GL320 starts at $53,400, while the GL450 starts at $55,900. Standard features on both include four-wheel drive, faux leather upholstery, a CD player with an auxiliary MP3 jack, dual-zone automatic climate control, a fixed third-row skylight, and heated, power-adjustable front seats. The GL550 hikes the price considerably ($77,375), but it comes stocked with standard features: larger wheels, a moonroof, leather, a backup camera, heated second-row seats, Harman Kardon audio, xenon headlights and a navigation system. Many of those features are optional on lesser trims.\n\nGL550 options include keyless access (it supplements the regular keyless entry) and a rear-seat DVD system. Fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class tops out around $83,000.\n\nGL-Class in the Market\nThe Mercedes-Benz GL-class’ price spread gives it a wide range of body-type competitors: At the low end it competes with Infiniti and Lincoln, and at the high end there’s Lexus and Land Rover. It seems less suited for the higher-tier competition, as its ride quality and control interface stop it short of luxury-SUV perfection, but as an alternative to some of its less-expensive competitors, the GL holds promise. It’s elegantly tailored, stylish and roomy, and for some families it could prove a worthy steed. Sales have been steady so far, but whether or not enough folks will be willing to look past the Mercedes-Benz GL-class’ annoyances to make it a success — particularly with $3.50-per-gallon gas — remains uncertain.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The argument for more diesels coming to America continues to fall on deaf ears.\n\nPeople have told me: They don’t like the fuel’s smell. They worry about breathing particulates. Diesel costs more than gasoline (sometimes). There are a host of other excuses why America shouldn’t have diesel cars and trucks. (There are some diesel trucks available.) American auto executives will offer another set of excuses, such as exhaust treatment kits, diesel powertrain markups and lack of consumer interest.\n\nI’m a consumer. I’m interested, and I firmly believe America should have more diesel vehicles.\n\nThey are the best internal combustion engine made. They’re tough, durable and can do the job better than any supercharged turbo-boosted gas-only engine. But facts have no place in arguments today — they haven’t changed people’s entrenched minds about national health care, so why should they on diesels.\n\nAnd here’s yet another example of the benefits of that oily little fuel so many people turn their noses up at like its vinegar being poured out a bottle of Pinot Noir: The Mercedes-Benz GL320 BlueTec.\n\nOther than owning a name that uses up more spaces than the alphabet, it’s a great SUV; phenomenal, really. It will encase you in luxury for 600 miles between fill ups and provide you with just enough environmental street cred to stave off hard stares from neighbors tooling around in Toyota Priuses and Lexus RX400hs.\n\nYou’ll blow both of those vehicles off the road with this big symbol of wealth, prestige and German power. GL320 has mad torque\n\nThe GL320 provides good fuel economy (diesel don’t have gas mileage), and it also gives you room for seven and the torque of a Mac truck.\n\nThe 3-liter V-6 under that nicely creased hood bangs out a 398 pound-feet of torque (while only producing 210 horsepower). You can feel that torque pulling on you every time you stomp the accelerator (diesels don’t have a gas pedal.)\n\nThere’s a common expression in the auto business that people buy horsepower and drive torque; but GL320 BlueTec twists that logic upside down.\n\nAs for the diesel part of the equation, Mercedes uses a new system that includes an oxidation catalyst and maintenance free particulate filter. To limit nitrogen oxide emissions (which is higher in diesels than gasoline engines) Mercedes uses an injection system coupled with a catalytic converter that changes the exhaust from NOx rich fumes to plain old nitrogen and water.\n\nAdBlue, the ammonia heavy fluid squirted into the exhaust, is maintained with the general maintenance of the vehicle at the dealership — where I imagine most Mercedes owners take their vehicle.\n\nSo there is some additional science involved in making diesels better — and this allows the GL320 to be sold in all 50 states. But lots more science is needed to make more efficient and cleaner machines to move people and things. SUV is full of technology\n\nThe ride of this SUV feels heavy and sound. (In part because it weighs a whopping 5,313 pounds.) But it’s also tied to the air suspension that can take any bump and make it nearly disappear.\n\nThe rich leather interior and wood trim make everything feel opulent and clean.\n\nThe GL320 comes full of technology, such as an improved COMMAND system which uses a 6.5-inch monitor in the dash to control the navigation system, 610-watt harmon/kardon Logic 7 audio system and the Sirius satellite radio. There’s also an optional iPod connector to play music from an iPod or other personal music device.\n\nAll of this luxury in the Mercedes can change your state of mind.\n\nThere’s a safe feeling behind the wheel of the GL320. Maybe you already know Mercedes-Benz’s reputation for safety. You know there are enough airbags at the ready to turn the cabin into an inflatable playhouse in case there’s a collision. There also the standard electronic stability control and traction control that turn your bad driving habits into world class maneuvers to prevent the collision from ever happening in the first place.\n\nOf course, if an accident is imminent, Mercedes has developed a PRE-SAFE package that anticipates an accident and prepares you for the worst. When the system senses the GL320 is out of control, it tightens the front seat belts, and the front passenger seat moves to the best location, windows close to allow the side curtain airbags to work better. If the SUV senses a possible rollover, the sunroof will close too. Its appearance is deceiving\n\nOther than a few nicely placed BlueTec badges, there’s very little for people to notice you’re helping the environment. The engine is very quiet, but if you listen closely, you can hear that distinct diesel tap-tap-tap from the fuel injectors.\n\nInside the cabin, you hear next to nothing.\n\nThe exterior is classic and defined. An oversized three pointed star sits in the middle of the grille — a feature that means no one will steal your hood ornament. It has a look that is part crossover and part truck, as if it its sheet metal was pushed too hard onto its frame. The big 20-inch wheels are stuffed inside the wheel wells and the body sits lower than you’d expect.\n\nEven though the driving position feels SUV high, allowing you to look over traffic on the road, when you step out of it, you’re surprised how close it is to the ground.\n\nAll of these safety features, good mileage and luxury items do come with a price. The GL320 BlueTec starts at $59,075 and a host of options can push the price north of $70,000. (The $8,000 Premium II package costs nearly as much as Chevrolet Aveo.)\n\nBut for someone who needs a seven-passenger, all-wheel drive SUV, there are few vehicles that offer such a complete package. The fact that it’s a high class diesel only helps spread the word. It may not create many converts, but it’s easier to make a case for more diesels when you arrive in this beautiful machine.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2011 about the 2011 Mercedes-Benz GL350 Bluetec. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLet’s face it: If you’re smitten by Mercedes’ GL-Class full-size SUV, the recent run-up in prices at the pump probably rates somewhere between insignificant and unimportant in your car search. With seating for seven, the GL-Class is a big SUV — and it gulps fuel like one. Even the most efficient version, the GL350 Bluetec diesel we tested, manages just an EPA-estimated 17/21 mpg city/highway. Likely more important to you would be a comfortable ride with commanding views, space for the family and all their stuff, and a level of luxury to justify a $60,000-plus base price.\n\nWhile the GL350 Bluetec diesel delivers the cushy ride, a combination of limited interior space and some irritating qualities weigh on this already-heavy SUV.\n\nIn models where both gas and diesel engines are available, the diesel is typically more expensive. In the GL-Class, however, the diesel GL350 Bluetec, with its $60,950 starting price, is the most affordable trim in the lineup. (Two V-8-powered gas models — the GL450 and GL550 — are more expensive.) Optional features pushed the price of our tester to $72,135. For a side-by-side comparison of the three trims, all of which have all-wheel drive, click here.\n\nFull-Size SUVs Aren’t What They Used to Be\nIf it’s been a few years since you’ve driven a full-size SUV, you’ll probably be surprised by how far this vehicle class has come in terms of ride comfort and handling poise. A decade ago, full-size SUVs had imprecise steering and poorly controlled body motions. Many of these flaws have been engineered out of today’s models, and the GL-Class shows how good things can be.\n\nThe GL350 is a very comfortable highway cruiser, and credit goes in part to the standard Airmatic height-adjustable air suspension. The big SUV floats softly over big dips in the road, and while you do feel it when it hits a bump or pothole, the impact is damped to the point that it doesn’t disturb you or your passengers.\n\nThe GL-Class also gives you a high driving position and great forward visibility — something that’s a supremely important factor for some shoppers.\n\nDiesel Power\nThe GL350 Bluetec’s 3.0-liter diesel V-6 makes 210 horsepower. There’s some familiar diesel clatter when accelerating, though the noise is nothing like an 18-wheeler. The sound is more akin to that of the newer diesel pickup trucks from Ford and Chevrolet, but it’s not as inconspicuous as today’s quietest clean-diesel cars.\n\nIf you’re considering the GL350 over a gas-powered GL, it may be because you’ve heard that diesels produce a lot of low-end power, or torque, providing spirited acceleration from a stop. This one does — the engine makes 400 pounds-feet of torque at just 1,600 rpm — but the delivery isn’t as satisfying as in some diesel cars, like the Volkswagen Golf TDI. The Golf TDI wallops you when accelerating, pushing you back in your seat. By comparison, the GL350 feels burdened by its hefty 5,423-pound curb weight. It gets around well enough, but it doesn’t move out authoritatively.\n\nDiesels also typically hold a fuel economy advantage over gas engines. The GL350’s combined EPA rating of 19 mpg is about 27 percent better than the 15 mpg combined rating the GL450 gets with its 4.6-liter gas V-8. However, the GL350’s combined rating lags those of other large diesel SUVs, including the BMW X5 xDrive35d (22 mpg) and Audi Q7 TDI (20 mpg).\n\nThat said, in everyday driving it’s easy to achieve average fuel economy figures that are higher than the EPA estimates. An hour-long drive on highways and suburban roads around Chicago returned average fuel economy of about 25 mpg. With a large 26.4-gallon fuel tank, the cruising range could easily stretch to 600 miles, which is good for both road trips and the inevitable day you have to hunt for a station that sells diesel.\n\nThe engine teams with a seven-speed automatic transmission. There are manual-shift paddles on the steering wheel, but they seem even more out of place in the GL than they do in most vehicles. They do, however, provide a way to hold a gear on steep grades that wouldn’t otherwise be available, as the SUV uses Mercedes’ stalk-style gear selector rather than a traditional shifter. The only real downside to the transmission during my test was that on two occasions, just after getting under way, it clunked when shifting at moderate speeds and light throttle. Hardly the kind of thing you’d expect from a Mercedes.\n\nMercedes cars don’t always have the best brake-pedal feel, but it feels pretty natural in the GL350. Stopping response is very linear, and the brake pedal has deep travel that lets you finely tune braking response.\n\nThe Inside\nThe GL’s cabin is finished in nice materials — that’s the price of entry in this class — but the interior design isn’t especially memorable. Fit and finish are also good.\n\nRanking as one of the more unusual upholstery decisions I’ve seen, the GL350 has a stitched leather dashboard but simulated leather seating, something Mercedes calls MB-Tex. While MB-Tex is remarkably good at emulating the real thing, you have to pay extra to get real leather on the seats — which is incomprehensible in a $60,000-plus luxury SUV.\n\nMercedes’ keypad interface for the optional navigation system got easier to use the longer I drove the GL350, but I’m still not a big fan of it. The screen’s menus look the same as those in the automaker’s S-Class and E-Class cars, but instead of the relatively intuitive knob controller Mercedes uses in those models, there’s a little keypad to the right of the screen. It leaves a lot to be desired in terms of usability. If I already have to reach toward the dash to adjust the system, just give me a touch-screen, please.\n\nWhile the GL provides a commanding view of the road, it’s not a huge climb up into the driver’s seat, which shorter drivers will appreciate. The front bucket seats are large and comfortable, neither too firm nor too soft.\n\nI was expecting the GL’s second row to be spacious because it’s a big SUV on the outside, but this row managed to just accommodate my 6-foot-1-inch frame. The biggest limiting factor is legroom; with the front seat adjusted to where I’d sit, my knees were nearly touching its backrest, and they would have been pressed against it were it not for the indentations in the seatback. The second-row backrests provide a few recline positions, but the seat itself is fixed, so you can’t slide it rearward for more legroom.\n\nFor a third row, the GL’s isn’t bad. I was able to sit back there, though I had to splay my legs to make them fit.\n\nCargo Room\nAs is the case in many large SUVs, despite having room for seven people in its three rows, the GL leaves little room for luggage when all its seats are in use; there’s just 14.3 cubic feet behind the third row. There’s some space underneath the cargo floor, but it’s only suitable for smaller things, like jumper cables.\n\nFull-Size Luxury SUV Cargo Room Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind 3rd Row\tBehind 2nd Row\tBehind 1st Row\n2011 Cadillac Escalade\t16.9\t60.3\t108.9\n2011 Infiniti QX56\t16.6\t49.6\t95.1\n2011 Lexus LX 570\t15.5\t41\t83.1\n2011 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class\t14.3\t43.8\t83.3\nManufacturer data\n\nThe GL has a standard power-operated third row, which is a great feature because it transforms what could be a cumbersome process of folding and opening the third row into a simple operation. It even works when the second row is reclined.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the first and second rows, side curtain airbags for all three rows, active head restraints for the front seats, an electronic stability system and Pre-Safe. When Pre-Safe detects that an accident may occur, it can cinch the front seat belts and close the sunroof and side windows.\n\nCheck out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for more information.\n\nGL350 Bluetec in the Market\nThe GL350 Bluetec rides and handles as well as anything in the full-size luxury SUV segment, and its interior is appropriately luxurious. Despite its problems, it’s also a strong seller in its class. Perhaps its most formidable challenge, however, is the stricter fuel economy standards that loom on the horizon.\n\nWhether through eliminating weight, downsizing drivetrains or adding advanced technology, automakers will need to increase the efficiency of big SUVs. Even the Bluetec diesel version of the GL may need to become more efficient. All these steps are likely to raise vehicle prices, so if you’re interested in a big luxury SUV as it is today, you may want to act soon.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nPiloting the redesigned 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450 feels like driving a massive bank vault — solid, quiet and heavy. And if you’re not careful with the option sheet, you’ll need your own bank vault to pay for it.\n\nCertain vehicles are made with specific markets in mind. The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is one of them — an expensive luxury SUV designed for the American market, built in Alabama and aimed at wealthy Americans’ love for big, fancy trucks.\n\nLarger than international luxury SUVs like the Land Rover Range Rover but smaller than domestic models like the Cadillac Escalade, the GL-Class has been a hit for Mercedes-Benz both in the U.S. and internationally, spawning several powertrain options and even a high-performance AMG trim. It’s the big papa of the Mercedes-Benz SUV lineup, slotting above the midsize ML-Class, which itself sits above the compact GLK-Class. The fourth SUV in the Benz lineup is the G-Class — a limited-production, ultra-expensive retro-wagon that is essentially a German Hummer.\n\nWe recently tested the new third-generation 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450 4Matic, a midlevel V-8-powered version, to see if this truly is the market’s best big SUV. We also drove the high-performance GL63 AMG, which you can compare with the rest of the lineup here. To compare the new GL-Class with the previous-generation 2012 model, click here.\n\nNot Your Typical Alabama Truck\nFamily-haulers come in many shapes, styles and prices in the U.S., with the GL-Class ranking near the top of the SUV food chain. A choice of powertrains is available, ranging from a surprisingly efficient (yet torquey) Bluetec diesel V-6 in the GL350 to a hugely powerful twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 in the top-of-the line AMG version. Our GL450 was the middleweight contender, powered by a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 making a respectable 362 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque. All engines are mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission driving a permanent all-wheel-drive system that Mercedes-Benz calls 4Matic. Another V-8 is available in the GL550, still 4.7 liters but with more aggressive turbo programming, making 429 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. If you simply must have the biggest, baddest ride on the block, opt for the GL63 AMG with its twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 cranking out 550 hp and 560 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe diesel engine comes in the least expensive model — rare in any vehicle class — and delivers the best EPA-estimated fuel economy in the lineup at 19/26 mpg city/highway. The numbers fall to 14/19 for the turbo V-8 in the GL450, 13/18 for the GL550 and 13/17 for the GL63.\n\nOur GL450 tester had plenty of power for acceleration, passing and cruising, while the GL63’s ferocious acceleration is far more than you’ll ever need. Both SUVs required a heavy foot in order to tap into it, however. With either drivetrain, throttle response and transmission kickdown was unacceptably slow: Decelerate at an intersection, make a right turn and push the gas to accelerate again, and nothing happens for a measurable second. So you push further into the gas, and suddenly the truck kicks down and leaps forward, snapping everyone’s head back. Perhaps this is a trick Mercedes-Benz is trying in order to encourage slower driving and higher fuel economy, but it results in some frustrating dynamics in around-town use. A selectable Sport mode in the GL63 hastens accelerator response to quell some of the lag, which is worst in the drivetrain’s Comfort mode.\n\nThat really is our only complaint about the driving experience, however, as the rest of the GL450’s behavior is quite civilized. The electrically boosted power steering is direct and well-damped over broken pavement, but doesn’t inspire athletic driving. The brakes are more than up to the task of stopping this 5,401-pound beast without fade, with a firm, progressive pedal and confident control. Previous sampling of both the GL350 diesel and GL550 V-8 reveal them to be equally civilized machines, at home on high-speed cross-country treks as well as low-speed crosstown errands. Highway stability is commendable even in strong crosswinds, and the all-wheel drive is surefooted in slippery, icy conditions. Aside from the throttle and transmission interaction, driving the GL450 is a serene, luxurious experience.\n\nAmong its myriad upgrades, the GL63 AMG gets unique steering tuning and active stabilizer bars atop an adaptive suspension that’s optional on lesser GL-Class models. (The active stabilizer bars can be had with a pricey Active Curve System, which is optional on lesser GL-Class models.) For such an elaborate setup, the results underwhelm. On bumpy roads, the chassis quivers about; broken pavement induces hints of floaty, disconnected wheel-hop — a degree of clumsiness that’s unbecoming of a six-figure performance SUV.\n\nThe GL63 boasts generous ride comfort, even in the sportiest of the suspension’s three settings. Dial it there, and the SUV barrels into sweeping curves with little body roll. Our tester’s P295/40R21 Z-rated tires stuck to the road like chewing gum to a desk. Unfortunately, none of those settings address the SUV’s straight-line composure — and when the pavement turns bumpy, the downsides show.\n\nThe Luxury Life\nLiving with the GL is equally cushy. Our GL450 was opulently appointed with thick, soft leather (a $1,620 option) and practically unlimited adjustability that could bring almost anyone to a comfortable driving position. The front seats also featured Mercedes’ massage system ($1,100), which inflates and deflates air bladders at timed intervals to create a kind of pressure-point massage. It doesn’t actually feel like a massage, though; it’s more like someone pushing you in the back. This is no Brookstone rolling massage shiatsu chair, but it isn’t half bad if you’ve spent all day in tiny regional jets and airport lounges.\n\nThe rear seats were equally comfortable, and our tester GL450 had DVD screens ($1,950) in the front-seat head restraints for rear passengers. The switches and buttons had a slick, high-quality feel, and the gauges were large and easily legible. The meaty steering wheel was covered in grippy leather and smooth wood ($590), with matching burl walnut on the instrument panel, center console and doors (included with the leather seats). At night, any of three colors of ambient lighting glowed softly from behind trim pieces to create a thoroughly modern atmosphere (part of a $3,500 Premium Package).\n\nThe GL is fully up-to-date in terms of electronics, featuring a full suite of standard connectivity options including Bluetooth cellphone link with streaming audio, a backup camera, keyless entry and start, and the company’s optional mbrace2 information and entertainment package.\n\nThe audio system’s sound quality is top drawer, but its operation is less than stellar. Selecting a preset radio station, for instance, is a multiclick operation. Mercedes uses a five-way selector and knob combination on the center console instead of a touch-screen, which saves the screen from smudgy fingerprints but does take some time to learn to use well. The menus are not arranged for ease of operation while in motion, but they are complete and offer the ability to adjust just about everything in the cabin — from the length of the driver’s seat-bottom cushion to the type of air distribution, direct or diffuse. Thankfully, climate controls are given their own clear, easy-to-use hard buttons.\n\nThe interior’s biggest asset is its versatility. This is a seven-seat SUV with two decent-sized third-row spots for adult-sized humans. It’s accessed by perhaps the simplest seat-folding mechanism ever devised: Push a button on the top of the second-row seat, and the seat folds down and forward automatically, even dropping the head restraints and powering the front seats forward automatically to free up clearance as necessary. Replacing the seat is done manually, but requires just a simple flip back into position. If you need cargo room more than passenger room, the second-row seats fold in a second configuration that allows for a flat cargo floor, maximizing the GL’s space.\n\nBehind the third row of seats is 16 cubic feet of cargo room, climbing to 49.4 cubic feet with the third row stored. With the second row folded, maximum cargo room in the GL is a sizable 93.8 cubic feet. This compares favorably with competitors like the Land Rover Range Rover (71.7 cubic feet) and Audi Q7 (72.5 cubic feet), but comes up short of bigger trucks like the Cadillac Escalade (108.9 cubic feet). Click here to see a comparison of these models.\n\nSafety\nThe GL-Class has not been crash-tested.\n\nLike most well-optioned Mercedes vehicles, the GL450 has a host of electronic safety equipment, a laundry list of “-Matic”, “-Magic” and “-Tronic” branded systems. Our test GL450 SUV featured the standard 4Matic all-wheel drive and Airmatic height adjustable air suspension, as well as Parktronic active park assist (an automatic parking function) and Distronic Plus automatic braking function. Few of these types of safety feature come standard, however, aside from the Collision Prevention Assist, an electronic system that detects objects in front of the vehicle and adjusts applied braking force depending on whether or not a collision seems imminent. It can even employ the Pre-Safe function, which applies the brakes automatically, although one wonders — what if you want to smash through whatever is in front of you?\n\nEven more advanced safety systems are available in packages like the Driver Assistance Package and Parking Assist Package. Systems like electronic stability and traction control, trailer sway control, antilock brakes and even a crosswind stability program are standard.

Our GL450 tester started at $64,805, including a $905 destination charge, but the GL350 with the Bluetec diesel engine starts at an even lower $63,305. Options can add up quickly, however, as our tester proved — an astonishing $23,130 in options alone brought the sticker up to $87,935. And that isn’t even the top end of the GL line. The GL63 AMG starts at $117,830 and can be optioned up to a loaded $123,775 — doubling the initial entry price for a GL. For full pricing specs on the GL, click here.\n\nThis means competitors come in two flavors — ones that compete with the more rationally priced base models, and ones that better match up with the GL’s outrageous, high-performance versions. At the lower end of the spectrum, the GL competes with big trucks like the Cadillac Escalade, which seats up to eight (in extended-length models) but is built on a GM truck platform that is decidedly less sophisticated than the GL in just about every way. The aged Escalade’s only real advantage is interior room and the availability of that even larger extended-length model. The Audi Q7 might be a good alternative, seeing as how it, too, seats seven and is considerably less expensive than the GL; the least expensive GL is still priced nearly $2,000 more than the most expensive Q7. But the Q7 comes up short of the GL’s interior volume. That leaves the Land Rover Range Rover, which can certainly hold its own with the GL on price, luxury and equipment, especially the Range Rover’s high-end, 510-hp V-8 model. But it is a smaller truck than the GL, seating only five, and the Land Rover’s high-end model’s price makes the GL63 AMG look like a bargain. To see how the GL compares with its competitors, click here.\n\nMercedes-Benz has created something fairly unique with the GL — a large, premium SUV that can fulfill a lot of roles and is tailored specifically for well-to-do American families. Less gaudy and more sophisticated than an Escalade but more useful than a Range Rover, the biggest Benz SUV fills a niche that competitor brands have yet to match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Piloting the redesigned 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450 feels like driving a massive bank vault — solid, quiet and heavy. And if you’re not careful with the option sheet, you’ll need your own bank vault to pay for it.\n\nCertain vehicles are made with specific markets in mind. The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is one of them — an expensive luxury SUV designed for the American market, built in Alabama and aimed at wealthy Americans’ love for big, fancy trucks.\n\nLarger than international luxury SUVs like the Land Rover Range Rover but smaller than domestic models like the Cadillac Escalade, the GL-Class has been a hit for Mercedes-Benz both in the U.S. and internationally, spawning several powertrain options and even a high-performance AMG trim. It’s the big papa of the Mercedes-Benz SUV lineup, slotting above the midsize ML-Class, which itself sits above the compact GLK-Class. The fourth SUV in the Benz lineup is the G-Class — a limited-production, ultra-expensive retro-wagon that is essentially a German Hummer.\n\nWe recently tested the new third-generation 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL450 4Matic, a midlevel V-8-powered version, to see if this truly is the market’s best big SUV. We also drove the high-performance GL63 AMG, which you can compare with the rest of the lineup here. To compare the new GL-Class with the previous-generation 2012 model, click here.\n\nNot Your Typical Alabama Truck\nFamily-haulers come in many shapes, styles and prices in the U.S., with the GL-Class ranking near the top of the SUV food chain. A choice of powertrains is available, ranging from a surprisingly efficient (yet torquey) Bluetec diesel V-6 in the GL350 to a hugely powerful twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 in the top-of-the line AMG version. Our GL450 was the middleweight contender, powered by a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 making a respectable 362 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque. All engines are mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission driving a permanent all-wheel-drive system that Mercedes-Benz calls 4Matic. Another V-8 is available in the GL550, still 4.7 liters but with more aggressive turbo programming, making 429 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. If you simply must have the biggest, baddest ride on the block, opt for the GL63 AMG with its twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 cranking out 550 hp and 560 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe diesel engine comes in the least expensive model — rare in any vehicle class — and delivers the best EPA-estimated fuel economy in the lineup at 19/26 mpg city/highway. The numbers fall to 14/19 for the turbo V-8 in the GL450, 13/18 for the GL550 and 13/17 for the GL63.\n\nOur GL450 tester had plenty of power for acceleration, passing and cruising, while the GL63’s ferocious acceleration is far more than you’ll ever need. Both SUVs required a heavy foot in order to tap into it, however. With either drivetrain, throttle response and transmission kickdown was unacceptably slow: Decelerate at an intersection, make a right turn and push the gas to accelerate again, and nothing happens for a measurable second. So you push further into the gas, and suddenly the truck kicks down and leaps forward, snapping everyone’s head back. Perhaps this is a trick Mercedes-Benz is trying in order to encourage slower driving and higher fuel economy, but it results in some frustrating dynamics in around-town use. A selectable Sport mode in the GL63 hastens accelerator response to quell some of the lag, which is worst in the drivetrain’s Comfort mode.\n\nThat really is our only complaint about the driving experience, however, as the rest of the GL450’s behavior is quite civilized. The electrically boosted power steering is direct and well-damped over broken pavement, but doesn’t inspire athletic driving. The brakes are more than up to the task of stopping this 5,401-pound beast without fade, with a firm, progressive pedal and confident control. Previous sampling of both the GL350 diesel and GL550 V-8 reveal them to be equally civilized machines, at home on high-speed cross-country treks as well as low-speed crosstown errands. Highway stability is commendable even in strong crosswinds, and the all-wheel drive is surefooted in slippery, icy conditions. Aside from the throttle and transmission interaction, driving the GL450 is a serene, luxurious experience.\n\nAmong its myriad upgrades, the GL63 AMG gets unique steering tuning and active stabilizer bars atop an adaptive suspension that’s optional on lesser GL-Class models. (The active stabilizer bars can be had with a pricey Active Curve System, which is optional on lesser GL-Class models.) For such an elaborate setup, the results underwhelm. On bumpy roads, the chassis quivers about; broken pavement induces hints of floaty, disconnected wheel-hop — a degree of clumsiness that’s unbecoming of a six-figure performance SUV.\n\nThe GL63 boasts generous ride comfort, even in the sportiest of the suspension’s three settings. Dial it there, and the SUV barrels into sweeping curves with little body roll. Our tester’s P295/40R21 Z-rated tires stuck to the road like chewing gum to a desk. Unfortunately, none of those settings address the SUV’s straight-line composure — and when the pavement turns bumpy, the downsides show.\n\nThe Luxury Life\nLiving with the GL is equally cushy. Our GL450 was opulently appointed with thick, soft leather (a $1,620 option) and practically unlimited adjustability that could bring almost anyone to a comfortable driving position. The front seats also featured Mercedes’ massage system ($1,100), which inflates and deflates air bladders at timed intervals to create a kind of pressure-point massage. It doesn’t actually feel like a massage, though; it’s more like someone pushing you in the back. This is no Brookstone rolling massage shiatsu chair, but it isn’t half bad if you’ve spent all day in tiny regional jets and airport lounges.\n\nThe rear seats were equally comfortable, and our tester GL450 had DVD screens ($1,950) in the front-seat head restraints for rear passengers. The switches and buttons had a slick, high-quality feel, and the gauges were large and easily legible. The meaty steering wheel was covered in grippy leather and smooth wood ($590), with matching burl walnut on the instrument panel, center console and doors (included with the leather seats). At night, any of three colors of ambient lighting glowed softly from behind trim pieces to create a thoroughly modern atmosphere (part of a $3,500 Premium Package).\n\nThe GL is fully up-to-date in terms of electronics, featuring a full suite of standard connectivity options including Bluetooth cellphone link with streaming audio, a backup camera, keyless entry and start, and the company’s optional mbrace2 information and entertainment package.\n\nThe audio system’s sound quality is top drawer, but its operation is less than stellar. Selecting a preset radio station, for instance, is a multiclick operation. Mercedes uses a five-way selector and knob combination on the center console instead of a touch-screen, which saves the screen from smudgy fingerprints but does take some time to learn to use well. The menus are not arranged for ease of operation while in motion, but they are complete and offer the ability to adjust just about everything in the cabin — from the length of the driver’s seat-bottom cushion to the type of air distribution, direct or diffuse. Thankfully, climate controls are given their own clear, easy-to-use hard buttons.\n\nThe interior’s biggest asset is its versatility. This is a seven-seat SUV with two decent-sized third-row spots for adult-sized humans. It’s accessed by perhaps the simplest seat-folding mechanism ever devised: Push a button on the top of the second-row seat, and the seat folds down and forward automatically, even dropping the head restraints and powering the front seats forward automatically to free up clearance as necessary. Replacing the seat is done manually, but requires just a simple flip back into position. If you need cargo room more than passenger room, the second-row seats fold in a second configuration that allows for a flat cargo floor, maximizing the GL’s space.\n\nBehind the third row of seats is 16 cubic feet of cargo room, climbing to 49.4 cubic feet with the third row stored. With the second row folded, maximum cargo room in the GL is a sizable 93.8 cubic feet. This compares favorably with competitors like the Land Rover Range Rover (71.7 cubic feet) and Audi Q7 (72.5 cubic feet), but comes up short of bigger trucks like the Cadillac Escalade (108.9 cubic feet). Click here to see a comparison of these models.\n\nSafety\nThe GL-Class has not been crash-tested.\n\nLike most well-optioned Mercedes vehicles, the GL450 has a host of electronic safety equipment, a laundry list of “-Matic”, “-Magic” and “-Tronic” branded systems. Our test GL450 SUV featured the standard 4Matic all-wheel drive and Airmatic height adjustable air suspension, as well as Parktronic active park assist (an automatic parking function) and Distronic Plus automatic braking function. Few of these types of safety feature come standard, however, aside from the Collision Prevention Assist, an electronic system that detects objects in front of the vehicle and adjusts applied braking force depending on whether or not a collision seems imminent. It can even employ the Pre-Safe function, which applies the brakes automatically, although one wonders — what if you want to smash through whatever is in front of you?\n\nEven more advanced safety systems are available in packages like the Driver Assistance Package and Parking Assist Package. Systems like electronic stability and traction control, trailer sway control, antilock brakes and even a crosswind stability program are standard. To see more safety equipment information, click here.\n\nIn the Market\nFinding an exact competitor to match up to the GL is somewhat difficult, as it is an unusual animal — a seven-seat, premium SUV with a wide price range. Our GL450 tester started at $64,805, including a $905 destination charge, but the GL350 with the Bluetec diesel engine starts at an even lower $63,305. Options can add up quickly, however, as our tester proved — an astonishing $23,130 in options alone brought the sticker up to $87,935. And that isn’t even the top end of the GL line. The GL63 AMG starts at $117,830 and can be optioned up to a loaded $123,775 — doubling the initial entry price for a GL.\n\nThis means competitors come in two flavors — ones that compete with the more rationally priced base models, and ones that better match up with the GL’s outrageous, high-performance versions. At the lower end of the spectrum, the GL competes with big trucks like the Cadillac Escalade, which seats up to eight (in extended-length models) but is built on a GM truck platform that is decidedly less sophisticated than the GL in just about every way. The aged Escalade’s only real advantage is interior room and the availability of that even larger extended-length model. The Audi Q7 might be a good alternative, seeing as how it, too, seats seven and is considerably less expensive than the GL; the least expensive GL is still priced nearly $2,000 more than the most expensive Q7. But the Q7 comes up short of the GL’s interior volume. That leaves the Land Rover Range Rover, which can certainly hold its own with the GL on price, luxury and equipment, especially the Range Rover’s high-end, 510-hp V-8 model. But it is a smaller truck than the GL, seating only five, and the Land Rover’s high-end model’s price makes the GL63 AMG look like a bargain. To see how the GL compares with its competitors, click here.\n\nMercedes-Benz has created something fairly unique with the GL — a large, premium SUV that can fulfill a lot of roles and is tailored specifically for well-to-do American families. Less gaudy and more sophisticated than an Escalade but more useful than a Range Rover, the biggest Benz SUV fills a niche that competitor brands have yet to match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Let’s face it: If you’re smitten by Mercedes-Benz’s GL-Class full-size SUV, the recent run-up in prices at the pump probably rates somewhere between insignificant and unimportant in your car search. With seating for seven, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a big SUV — and it gulps fuel like one. Even the most efficient version, the GL350 Bluetec diesel we tested, manages just an EPA-estimated 17/21 mpg city/highway. Likely more important to you would be a comfortable ride with commanding views, space for the family and all their stuff, and a level of luxury to justify a $60,000-plus base price.\n\nWhile the GL350 Bluetec diesel delivers the cushy ride, a combination of limited interior space and some irritating qualities weigh on this already-heavy SUV.\n\nIn models where both gas and diesel engines are available, the diesel is typically more expensive. In the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, however, the diesel GL350 Bluetec, with its $60,950 starting price, is the most affordable trim in the lineup. (Two V-8-powered gas models — the GL450 and GL550 — are more expensive.) Optional features pushed the price of our tester to $72,135. For a side-by-side comparison of the three trims, all of which have all-wheel drive, click here.\n\nFull-Size SUVs Aren’t What They Used to Be\nIf it’s been a few years since you’ve driven a full-size SUV, you’ll probably be surprised by how far this vehicle class has come in terms of ride comfort and handling poise. A decade ago, full-size SUVs had a primative body-on-frame design, leading to imprecise steering and poorly controlled body motions. Many of these flaws have been engineered out of today’s models, and the GL-Class shows how good things can be.\n\nThe GL350 is a very comfortable highway cruiser, and credit goes in part to the standard Airmatic height-adjustable air suspension. The big SUV floats softly over big dips in the road, and while you do feel it when it hits a bump or pothole, the impact is damped to the point that it doesn’t disturb you or your passengers.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GL-Class models also give you a high driving position and great forward visibility — something that’s a supremely important factor for some shoppers.\n\nDiesel Power\nThe GL350 Bluetec’s 3.0-liter diesel V-6 makes 210 horsepower. There’s some familiar diesel clatter when accelerating, though the noise is nothing like an 18-wheeler. The sound is more akin to that of the newer diesel pickup trucks from Ford and Chevrolet, but it’s not as inconspicuous as today’s quietest clean-diesel cars.\n\nIf you’re considering the GL350 over a gas-powered GL, it may be because you’ve heard that diesels produce a lot of low-end power, or torque, providing spirited acceleration from a stop. This one does — the engine makes 400 lb-ft of torque at just 1,600 rpm — but the delivery isn’t as satisfying as in some diesel cars, like the Volkswagen Golf TDI. The Golf TDI wallops you when accelerating, pushing you back in your seat. By comparison, the GL350 feels burdened by its hefty 5,423-pound curb weight. It gets around well enough, but it doesn’t move out authoritatively.\n\nDiesels also typically hold a fuel economy advantage over gas engines, especially the large-dispacement V-8s that you would find in the GL550. The GL350’s combined EPA rating of 19 mpg is about 27 percent better than the 15 mpg combined rating the GL450 gets with its 4.6-liter gas V-8. However, the GL350’s combined rating lags those of other large diesel SUVs, including the BMW X5 xDrive35d (22 mpg) and Audi Q7 TDI (20 mpg).\n\nThat said, in everyday driving it’s easy to achieve average fuel economy figures that are higher than the EPA estimates. An hour-long drive on highways and suburban roads around Chicago returned average fuel economy of about 25 mpg. With a large 26.4-gallon fuel tank, the cruising range could easily stretch to 600 miles, which is good for both road trips and the inevitable day you have to hunt for a station that sells diesel.\n\nThe engine teams with a seven-speed automatic transmission. There are manual-shift paddles on the steering wheel, but they seem even more out of place in the GL than they do in most vehicles. They do, however, provide a way to hold a gear on steep grades that wouldn’t otherwise be available, as the SUV uses Mercedes’ stalk-style gear selector rather than a traditional shifter. The only real downside to the transmission during my test was that on two occasions, just after getting under way, it clunked when shifting at moderate speeds and light throttle. Hardly the kind of thing you’d expect from a Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMercedes-Benz cars don’t always have the best brake-pedal feel, but it feels pretty natural in the GL350. Stopping response is very linear, and the brake pedal has deep travel that lets you finely tune braking response.\n\nThe Inside\nThe GL’s cabin is finished in nice materials — that’s the price of entry in this class — but the interior design isn’t especially memorable. Fit and finish are also good.\n\nRanking as one of the more unusual upholstery decisions I’ve seen, the GL350 has a stitched leather dashboard but simulated leather seating, something Mercedes-Benz calls M-B-Tex. While MB-Tex is remarkably good at emulating the real thing, you have to pay extra to get real leather on the seats — which is incomprehensible in a $60,000-plus luxury SUV.\n\nMercedes’ keypad interface for the optional navigation system got easier to use the longer I drove the GL350, but I’m still not a big fan of it. The screen’s menus look the same as those in the automaker’s S-Class and E-Class cars, but instead of the relatively intuitive knob controller Mercedes-Benz uses in those models, there’s a little keypad to the right of the screen. It leaves a lot to be desired in terms of usability. If I already have to reach toward the dash to adjust the system, just give me a touch-screen, please.\n\nWhile the Mercedes-Benz GL-class provides a commanding view of the road, it’s not a huge climb up into the driver’s seat, which shorter drivers will appreciate. The front bucket seats are large and comfortable, neither too firm nor too soft.\n\nI was expecting the GL-class’ second row to be spacious because it’s a big SUV on the outside, but this row managed to just accommodate my 6-foot-1-inch frame. The biggest limiting factor is legroom; with the front seat adjusted to where I’d sit, my knees were nearly touching its backrest, and they would have been pressed against it were it not for the indentations in the seatback. The second-row backrests provide a few recline positions, but the seat itself is fixed, so you can’t slide it rearward for more legroom.\n\nFor a third row, the GL-class’ isn’t bad. I was able to sit in the third-row rear-seat, though I had to splay my legs to make them fit.\n\nCargo Room\nAs is the case in many large SUVs, despite having room for seven people in its three rows, the GL leaves little room for luggage when all its seats are in use; there’s just 14.3 cubic feet behind the third row. There’s some space underneath the cargo floor, but it’s only suitable for smaller things, like jumper cables.\n\nFull-Size Luxury SUV Cargo Room Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind 3rd Row\tBehind 2nd Row\tBehind 1st Row\n2011 Cadillac Escalade\t16.9\t60.3\t108.9\n2011 Infiniti QX56\t16.6\t49.6\t95.1\n2011 Lexus LX 570\t15.5\t41\t83.1\n2011 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class\t14.3\t43.8\t83.3\nManufacturer data\n\nThe GL-class has a standard power-operated third row, which is a great feature because it transforms what could be a cumbersome process of folding and opening the third row into a simple operation. It even works when the second row is reclined.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the first and second rows, side curtain airbags for all three rows, active head restraints for the front seats, an electronic stability system and Pre-Safe. When Pre-Safe detects that an accident may occur, it can cinch the front seat belts and close the sunroof and side windows.\n\nCheck out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for more information.\n\nGL350 Bluetec in the Market\nThe GL350 Bluetec rides and handles as well as anything in the full-size luxury SUV segment, and its interior is appropriately luxurious. Despite its problems, it’s also a strong seller in its class. Perhaps its most formidable challenge, however, is the stricter fuel economy standards that loom on the horizon.\n\nWhether through eliminating weight, downsizing drivetrains or adding advanced technology, automakers will need to increase the efficiency of big SUVs. Even the Bluetec diesel version of the Mercedes-Benz GL-class may need to become more efficient. All these steps are likely to raise vehicle prices, so if you’re interested in a big luxury SUV as it is today, you may want to act soon.\n\nSend Mike an email",
