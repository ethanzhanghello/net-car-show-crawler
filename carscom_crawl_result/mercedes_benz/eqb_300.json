      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz EQB is a five- or seven-seat small luxury SUV. If it looks vaguely familiar, that’s because it shares a platform with the gasoline-powered Mercedes-Benz GLB. Seating is adult-friendly in the first and second rows, but while the optional third row sounds handy, it’s usable only for small children or pets. There are three EQB trims: The EQB250+ has 188 horsepower and comes with front-wheel drive, while the EQB300 4Matic and EQB350 4Matic have all-wheel drive and horsepower ratings of 225 and 288, respectively. The EQB’s rivals include the BMW iX, Genesis Electrified GV70, Tesla Model Y and Volvo EX40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe EQB receives minor changes for 2025. An Exclusive trim level for all three versions comes with a 360-degree surround-view camera, a Burmester sound system and heated front seats. New cosmetic options include two new wheel designs and an EQB Design Package that brings unique interior and exterior design elements.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB Have?\n\nThe EQB’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 205 to 251 miles, depending on trim level.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe EQB can be charged from 10% to 80% in as little as 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.25-inch digital gauge panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n“Hey Mercedes” virtual assistant\nFour USB-C ports\nNavigation\nDual-zone climate control\nKeyless start\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention alert\nAutomated park-assist system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHead-up instrument display\nBurmester audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view camera system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nThird-row seats\nLeather upholstery\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nWireless device charging\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe EQB has a comfortable ride, high-quality cabin and OK driving range — at least in its base 250+ FWD trim. We’re fans of the EQB’s relaxed driving manners, just don’t expect overly sporty dynamics when you’re behind the wheel. A curb weight of more than 4,700 pounds means this luxury electric SUV works best when it’s not rushed.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Quick, sensible, useful and comfortable, the EQB 300 and 350 are appealing, well-executed compact luxury electric SUVs with just enough style, but they’re lacking some common standard features.\n\nVersus the competition: Priced to compete with the Audi Q4 e-Tron, the uplevel Volkswagen ID.4, and the Tesla Model Y, the EQB is nicer than any of those cars on the inside, but it can’t match the Tesla’s acceleration, charging performance, or range.\n\n \n\nMercedes-Benz has focused a lot of time and attention on its flashy new electric offerings, all encompassed under a Mercedes-EQ sub-brand. We’ve seen and driven the EQS luxury sedan, the smaller EQE mid-size car, and the EQS full-size luxury SUV, but there’s another electric Mercedes at the “entry-level” end of the spectrum: the five- or seven-seat EQB compact SUV. Unlike larger offerings in the Mercedes-EQ lineup, the EQB is based on an existing model, the GLB, that’s been heavily modified to accept an electric powertrain. Interestingly, the EQB retains the GLB’s five- or seven-seat configuration. That’s the first surprise; the second is just how good it is to drive and use.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQB: The GLB Goes Electric\n\nConventional Styling, Conventional Thinking\n\nRight off the bat, the EQB’s look is quite familiar. Only the front and rear styling changed in its transformation into an electric vehicle, along with the addition of some special colors and wheels. The idea was to keep it as normal-looking as possible; if you didn’t know what you were looking at, you might assume it was just a typical gas-powered SUV. The blocked-off, smoothed-over front grille, however, features the new signature Mercedes-EQ lighting strip, identifying it as something different.\n\nOverall, the look is conventional — not swoopy, crazy modern, or science-fictiony, like the Mercedes-EQ EQE and EQS sedans. It’s an upright, comfortable introduction to EVs for someone who might be interested in moving from a familiar Mercedes-Benz product to an all-electric alternative. It should work well in this regard.\n\nInterior Is Just as Familiar\n\nStep into the upright cabin and you’ll see an interior that’s nearly identical to the gas-powered GLB’s, and that’s a good thing. Of Mercedes-Benz’s various compact offerings, including the more space-challenged GLA, the formal roofline of the GLB and EQB creates a much roomier feeling inside. Visibility outward is excellent, the driving position is comfortable and tall, and there’s a surprising amount of legroom, headroom, and hip room in both the first and second rows of seats. There’s also an optional two-seat third row, but it’s suitable only for children. That extra seating capacity might be useful for families using the EQB as emergency soccer-team transport, but most everyone else can skip it (though it is made a bit more usable by the fact that the second row can slide forward and back).\n\nWhat might surprise people most about the EQB is the SUV’s interior tech: It has the prior generation of Mercedes’ MBUX multimedia system, not the latest and greatest version that graces the company’s newest offerings. And while we normally like having the latest and greatest of anything, the previous system was just better. It’s easier to use, with far less information overload, and it’s controlled via buttons and switches, not capacitive touch sensors (at least on the center console).\n\nThese little details give the EQB a more luxurious feel than a lot of Mercedes’ newer offerings, and that’s thanks to the actual tactile feedback you get from those buttons and switches; you don’t just feel a flat plastic panel under your fingertips. It might not look as flashy as the newest MBUX screens — and indeed, the 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster and accompanying 10.25-inch central touchscreen do look a little dinky compared with what’s available in a model like the EQE sedan — but they work well, they’re positioned properly, and they’re far less likely to elicit user frustration than the newer system.\n\nFun to Drive – But Not Too Much Fun\n\nTo start, the EQB will come in two flavors. The EQB 300 4Matic, with standard all-wheel drive and one motor on each axle for a combined output of 225 horsepower and 288 pounds-feet of torque. Stepping up to the EQB 350 4Matic gets you 288 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque. It’s all powered by a 70.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, which is a bit smaller than the packs found in the EQE and EQS. EPA-estimated driving range for the 2022 EQB 300 is 243 miles, while the 2022 EQB 350 has a 227-mile range. The all-wheel-drive Tesla Model Y Long Range, by comparison, has an EPA-estimated range of 330 miles, while the new Audi Q4 e-Tron is rated for 265 miles in its single-motor configuration, 236 miles with all-wheel drive.\n\nI took a quick spin in a 2022 EQB 350 late last year, but for this review I spent a week in an EQB 300 that was on the lower end of the price spectrum, with few options — and some surprising omissions. It was also a 2022 model, but the EQB 300 is unchanged for the 2023 model year.\n\nMercedes-Benz says the EQB 300 can go from 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds (the 350 shaves a second off that time), and my test car felt plenty zippy both in urban traffic and out on the highway — which is to be expected from an electric car with plenty of torque available right off the line. Acceleration wasn’t quite as brisk as in the more powerful EQB 350, but it was more than adequate to keep up with traffic and accelerate quickly away from stoplights. As with most EVs, power was always delivered in a seamless rush.\n\nBraking was also quite good, with firmer pedal feel and better feedback for the driver than I’ve experienced in other Mercedes EVs. Activating the car’s more aggressive regenerative-braking modes doesn’t have the same pedal-moving trick that the EQE and EQS do, so one-pedal driving in the EQB is a much more pleasant experience than in those other EQ models. In them, the brake pedal automatically depresses when in the more aggressive regen mode, so it’s not located where you think it should be when you go to hit the brakes. It’s a highly unnerving feeling, and the EQB’s way is better.\n\nWhere the EQB suffers a little is in its ride and handling. The ride is excellent, but you begin to feel just how heavy this little crossover is – 4,718 pounds, according to Mercedes – when you hit bumps or dips in the pavement. The EQB handles them well, but then it porpoises a bit as it settles on its suspension in a way that’s more reminiscent of a big 1970s-era American sedan. It’s not what you’d call wallowy, but it does take a cycle or two of bouncing before it recovers its composure.\n\nYou feel this car’s heft again when you change directions or try some spirited driving on twisty roads. The EQB responds with composure but not enthusiasm, thanks both to its fairly numb steering feel and, again, to that sense of weight being thrown around thanks to its heavy battery pack. The EQB 300 weighs 827 pounds more than a seven-seat GLB 250 4Matic, and while the modified suspension does a good job accommodating that extra weight, you do feel it. Better to just use the EQB as an urban commuter and runabout, not a canyon-carver. It simply wasn’t meant to be used like that, and it’s happier as an around-town family truckster.\n\nThe EQB also lacks the range and rapid-charging capabilities necessary to be a great long-distance cruiser. The EQB 300 is rated for 243 miles of range, but with cold temperatures and frequent highway use, I got only about two-thirds of that, per the EQB’s predicted range meter. The EQB can accept up to 100 kilowatts of power from a DC fast charger, and Mercedes-Benz says it can DC fast charge from 10% to 80% in 32 minutes if all conditions are right. That falls short of the fast-charging performance available from most new Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models.\n\nPriced to Compete\n\nThe 2022 EQB went on sale last year, and 2023 models are available at Mercedes dealerships now. My test vehicle had a starting price of $55,550, including delivery fee. This puts it pretty much on par with the Audi Q4 e-Tron and high-end trims of the Volkswagen ID.4. Tesla’s new lower pricing for the Model Y (as of this writing) actually makes its starting price slightly less than the EQB 300’s, which should give a number of buyers pause given the Tesla’s superior performance and range, plus access to the automaker’s network of Superchargers. Later this year, the EQB will face additional competition from the likes of the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV, which will be a bit bigger than the EQB but won’t have Mercedes’ luxury cachet. My test car’s as-tested price rang in at $57,650; it was only lightly optioned with a few features, like heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, and a portable charging cable – but not things like keyless entry. It boggles the mind that this isn’t standard in an SUV with push-button start.\n\nBetween the two models, the EQB 300 is probably the one I’d choose. The extra power from the EQB 350’s more powerful motors is nice, but the reduction in estimated range isn’t worth that extra oomph. For now, however, the EQB SUV is an interesting alternative to a Tesla Model Y, providing a comfortable, stylish, and useful interior — if not quite matching that car on range or performance. For people looking for something other than a Tesla, it’s worth putting the EQB on your list.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\nWhat’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2023?\nMercedes-Benz Announces Plans for High-Speed Charging Network\n2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV: Filling Out the Lineup With a Mid-Size Electric SUV\nShop for a 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQB 300\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz EQB is a five- or seven-seat small luxury SUV. If it looks vaguely familiar, that’s because it shares a platform with the gasoline-powered Mercedes-Benz GLB. Seating is adult-friendly in the first and second rows, and while the optional third row sounds handy, it’s usable only for small children or pets. There are three EQB trims: The EQB 250+ has 188 horsepower and comes with front-wheel drive, while the EQB 300 4Matic and EQB 350 4Matic have all-wheel drive and horsepower ratings of 225 and 288, respectively. The EQB’s rivals include the BMW iX, Genesis Electrified GV70, Tesla Model Y and Volvo XC40 Recharge.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nMercedes-Benz has made a few cosmetic tweaks to the EQB to bring its looks more in line with the company’s other EQ electric vehicles. Among minor technical revisions, the EQB also gets a new steering wheel with touch-sensitive controls, and the infotainment system is upgraded to Mercedes’ latest MBUX software. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB Have?\n\nThe EQB’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 207 to 251 miles, depending on trim level.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe EQB can be charged from 10% to 80% in as little as 30 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n10.25-inch digital gauge panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n“Hey Mercedes” virtual assistant\nFour USB-C ports\nNavigation\nDual-zone climate control\nKeyless start\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nDriver-attention alert\nAutomated park-assist system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHead-up instrument display\nBurmester audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view camera system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nThird-row seats\nLeather upholstery\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nWireless device charging\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB?\n\nThe EQB has a comfortable ride, high-quality cabin and OK driving range — at least in its base 250+ FWD trim. We’re fans of the EQB’s relaxed driving manners; just don’t expect overly sporty dynamics when you’re behind the wheel. A curb weight of more than 4,700 pounds means this luxury electric SUV works best when it’s not rushed.",

      "expert_review": "Quietly appearing in showrooms over the next few weeks will be an all-electric SUV that’s quite likely going to surprise a lot of people for a few different reasons. The smallest entry into the American lineup for Mercedes-Benz’s electric division, called Mercedes-EQ, is set to arrive soon: the 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQB SUV. Unlike the larger offerings in the Mercedes-EQ lineup (the EQE and EQS sedans and upcoming EQS SUV), the EQB is based on an existing model that’s been heavily modified to accept an electric powertrain. This is essentially an electric version of the popular GLB SUV and, interestingly, also retains that model’s five- or seven-occupant options. That’s the first surprise; the second is just how good it is to drive and use.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQB: The GLB Goes Electric\n\nConventional Styling, Conventional Thinking\n\nRight off the bat, the look of the EQB is familiar. Only the front and rear styling has changed in its transition to an electric vehicle, and along with some special colors and wheels, the idea was to keep it as normal as possible; if you didn’t know what you were looking at, you might just assume it’s a typical gas-powered model. But the blocked-off, smoothed-over grille out front with the new signature Mercedes-EQ lighting strip above the headlights help identify it as something more unusual. Unique to the EQB was my test car’s Rose Gold paint, which Mercedes representatives say is going to be a signature color for the company’s electric offerings.\n\nOverall, the look is conventional — not swoopy, crazy modern or science-fictiony like the EQE and EQS sedans are. It’s a comfortable introduction to someone who might be interested in transitioning from a more familiar Mercedes-Benz product into an all-electric alternative, and it should work well in that regard.\n\nJust as Familiar Inside\n\nStep into the upright cabin and you face an interior nearly identical to the standard gas-powered GLB’s, which is a good thing. Of Mercedes’ various compact offerings, including the more space-challenged GLA, the formal roofline of the GLB and subsequent EQB create a much roomier feel inside. Visibility outward is excellent, driving position is comfortable and tall, and there’s a surprising amount of legroom, headroom and hip room in both the first and second rows of seats. Yes, there is an optional third row, but it’s suitable only for children. It’s made a bit more usable by the fact that the second row can slide fore and aft. For a small family, having that extra capacity for a family hauler that might see occasional duty as an emergency soccer team transport might be useful to have; for most everyone else, skip the third row or wait for the much bigger upcoming EQS SUV instead.\n\nPerhaps what might surprise people the most about the EQB is the SUV’s interior tech. This is the last-generation version of the Mercedes-Benz MBUX multimedia system, not the latest and greatest version that graces the company’s newest offerings. Normally, we like having the latest and greatest of anything, but in this case, the previous system is frankly better. It’s easier to use, with far less information overload and controls that are still buttons and switches, not capacitive-touch.\n\nThese little details give the EQB a more luxurious feel than a lot of the newer offerings from the marque thanks to actual tactile feedback for those buttons and switches instead of just the feel of a flat plastic panel under your fingertips. It might not look as flashy as the newest MBUX screens — and indeed, the 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster and accompanying 10.25-inch central touchscreen did look a little dinky after getting out of an EQE earlier in the day — but they work well, they’re positioned properly, and they’re far less likely to cause user frustration than the newer systems.\n\nFun to Drive, But Not Too Much Fun\n\nTo start, the EQB will come in two flavors: The EQB300 4Matic has standard all-wheel drive, with one motor on each axle and a combined system output of 225 horsepower and 288 pounds-feet of torque. Or you can bump up to the EQB350 4Matic, like my test car, and get a healthier 288 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque. Each are powered by a 70.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack — a bit smaller than the ones found in the EQE and EQS, but still likely to propel the EQB for about 230 miles on a charge, according to what my test vehicle was showing at the start of my drive (final EPA range estimates are not yet available).\n\nWhile Mercedes hasn’t given any published 0-60 mph estimates for the EQB, my test car felt plenty zippy in traffic around the greater Denver area, which is to be expected from an electric car with plentiful torque available right off the line. Acceleration is calm when called for or brisk when requested, but as with most EVs, it was always delivered in a seamless rush. Braking was also quite good, with firmer pedal feel and better communication to the driver than I’ve experienced in other Mercedes EVs. Activating the more aggressive regenerative braking modes doesn’t have the same pedal-moving trick that the EQE and EQS do, allowing for one-pedal driving without the frustrating action seen in other EQ models.\n\nWhere the EQB slows down a little is in its ride and handling. The ride is excellent, but you begin to feel just how heavy the little crossover is when you hit some bumps or dips in the pavement. The EQB handles them well, but then porpoises a bit as it settles on its suspension in a way more reminiscent of a big, 1970s American sedan. It’s not what you’d call “wallowy,” but it does require a cycle or two of bouncing on some bumps to recover its composure.\n\nYou feel this heft again when you change directions or try for some spirited driving on twisty switchback mountain roads. The EQB responds with composure but not enthusiasm thanks to its fairly numb steering feel and, again, that sense of weight being thrown around due to the heavy battery pack. The EQB weighs 4,718 pounds, which is 827 pounds more than a comparable seven-occupant GLB250 4Matic, and while it’s well accommodated by the modified suspension, you do feel it. It’ll be better to use the EQB as an urban commuter and runabout instead of a canyon carver; it simply wasn’t meant to be used like that, and it’s happier just being a family truckster.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMercedes-Benz Plans EQB Electric SUV for U.S.\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLB35?\nMercedes SUVs: There Are Many, So Which Is Right for You?\nPriced to Compete\n\nThe 2022 EQB was supposed to be on sale in the summer, but it hasn’t yet arrived in showrooms and the end of the year is in sight. We do know starting prices, however: The EQB300 4Matic will start at $55,550 (prices include destination fee), while the more powerful EQB350 4Matic will start at $59,100. This pretty much puts it smack on par with the latest prices for the Tesla Model Y (as of this writing, anyway), upcoming Audi Q4 E-Tron and high-end trims of the Volkswagen ID.4. And in 2023, it will face additional competition from the likes of the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer RS and SS EV, as well, which will be a bit bigger than the EQB but lack the Mercedes luxury cachet.\n\nFor now, however, the new EQB SUV is an interesting alternative to a Tesla Model Y, providing a comfortable, stylish and useful interior, if not quite matching up on possible range or performance. For people looking for something other than a Model Y, it’s worth putting on your list.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
