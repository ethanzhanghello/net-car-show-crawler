      "expert_review": "Not too long ago, I wrote an article about how the Mercedes-Benz E400 wagon should be your next Mercedes-Benz. I extolled the virtues of its fine interior, the spacious cabin, the smooth and highly responsive turbocharged V-6 and nine-speed automatic. I said that its price tag, while lofty, was eminently reasonable for such a fine automobile, and that all these things made it the perfect model to buy if you were thinking about a new Benz. I also said that the more expensive, faster, more athletic E63 wagon really wasn’t necessary because the E400 was more than enough car.\n\nI was wrong. I was so wrong.\n\nAfter spending a week in the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon, I rescind the verdict I made about the lesser E400. That’s not the Benz you want; this is. Yes, it’s more expensive, to the tune of nearly $40,000 extra. But it’s also $40,000 better than the already outstanding E400 wagon. That extra cash gets you more than just a quicker car; it gets you one that can embarrass sports cars costing twice as much. It gets you a car that’s richly rewarding to drive, has an imposing physical presence and can carry five people and luggage to boot. And because it sits lower than an SUV, it doesn’t have the tippy, piggish handling characteristics of most go-fast family haulers.\n\nThe Perfect Looks\n\nStation wagons used to be big in this country, and they still are in most of the rest of the world. Americans’ love of SUVs has ended the reign of the family wagon, and that’s a shame. Just look at this beast: long lines stretching from front to back that accentuate a long, low profile — and that roofline is pure artistry. White is not this car’s best color, but it does help it fly under the radar when blasting down a highway. Nobody’s paying attention to the white station wagon; they’re all looking at the brightly colored sports coupes. Never mind that this family wagon can outperform nearly anything else on four wheels.\n\nThe E63’s wagon shape is part of its appeal. You can get it as a sedan, but for a few dollars more, you add that extra cargo room that makes it totally unique. Its 35 cubic feet is roughly triple the cargo volume of the sedan, plus you can drop the seats and get a cavernous 64 cubic feet of room — in a vehicle with a 603-horsepower V-8. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 has a little more cargo room at 38 cubic feet behind the backseat (expandable to a much larger 80.3 cubic feet thanks to its taller roof), but that mid-size performance SUV doesn’t match the E63 wagon’s performance numbers, probably because it’s over 500 pounds heavier.\n\nThe Perfect Drive\n\nThe E63’s weight advantage over the slightly larger but porkier GLE63 really comes out when you start to drive the E63 aggressively. The AMG Dynamic Select drive modes allow you to choose between several sport settings, plus an individual setting that allows you to customize different systems to your tastes. I generally kept things in Comfort mode, as the suspension is already as firm as I’d care to experience anywhere outside an Autobahn or dedicated racetrack. While not harsh or punishing, the E63 wagon’s softest suspension setting reminds you that this is not your average family hauler; it’s a supercar in drag.\n\nThe E63 is powered by Mercedes-AMG’s ubiquitous hand-built 4.0-liter V-8 engine. It now features new twin-scroll turbochargers for the first time and has been boosted to 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. Power is channeled through a dual-clutch nine-speed automatic transmission and now goes down to all four wheels via a new AMG Performance 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. The transmission can be left in automatic mode or shifted manually via paddles behind the steering wheel.\n\nDespite all that plumbing and the massive power on hand, the E63 drives as smooth as silk in all conditions. Leave it in Comfort mode and it won’t upset those bags of groceries in the cargo area in the slightest. Acceleration flows calmly and easily, the brakes are firm and progressive, and ride quality is acceptably firm. Even in the softest mode, the car’s steering feel is still communicative and tight — with no wallowing, no play, no vagueness to be found.\n\nAfter you’ve dropped off the groceries and your mother-in-law, of course, it’s time to have some fun, and fun is just a few knobs away. Slip the E63 into Sport or Sport Plus mode (leave Race for the track), and everything comes alive. Throttle response is immediate, shifts bang off with racecar precision, and steering feel goes from enjoyable to ridiculously accurate.\n\nMercedes says the big wagon sprints from zero-to-60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, matching the factory numbers from the 797-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye. The company hasn’t published any times for the GLE63 S SUV, but given that it doesn’t have as much power as the E63 and has two fewer gears and weighs considerably more, it’s no stretch to say the E63 wagon is quicker. I’d put it up against the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio — the only other SUV I’ve driven on a track and enjoyed — in terms of abilities. The turbocharged V-6 Stelvio is still down 100 hp and two cylinders from the E63 wagon, but it’s also smaller and lighter, and it feels that way when driven hard.\n\nThe E63’s fuel economy isn’t stellar, but considering what the car can do and what kind of equipment it’s packing, it’s more than acceptable — even superior to most of its SUV competitors. The EPA rates the E63 S wagon at 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week with it, which included several hundred miles of highway driving, netted 21.4 mpg, beating the combined rating. It also bests competing SUVs from BMW, Jeep and Land Rover thanks to its lower weight and standard cylinder deactivation.\n\nThe Perfect Interior\n\nOK, so maybe the interior of the S-Class is slightly more opulent, but the E-Class gives up almost nothing to its more expensive showroom sibling. It has the same high-quality controls, the same kinds of electronic displays, the same multimedia systems, even the same adjustable interior lighting offering 64 color combinations. Mercedes-Benz has done wonders at filtering the opulence of its most premium sedans down through its lineup, and the E63 is no exception. My test car was rather somberly done up in Nappa black leather with silver stitching, accented by black-ash wood trim — not the most adventurous color combination. (There are some much more appealing hues available.) It did, however, accent the sporting character of the car nicely.\n\nThe front seats are heavily bolstered, as they need to be to keep you in place should you ever take your E63 to a track. There’s more headroom for both front and backseat occupants in the E-Class wagon than there is in the sedan, even with the standard panoramic moonroof. Backseat legroom can be a little tight, as is typical of rear-drive German sports sedans, but the E63’s interior is extremely comfortable overall.\n\nIt’s also surprisingly quiet — a credit to the extra-cost insulation package my test vehicle was equipped with. The Acoustic Comfort Package added more sound insulation to the cabin, as well as an acoustic and thermal membrane to the windshield and side windows. There’s more noise than you’d hear in a sedan thanks to the wagon’s cavernous cargo area, but it’s mostly the glorious rumble of that unholy V-8 engine — which can get quite loud when you’ve pushed the button to open up the exhaust’s butterfly valves.\n\nThe only foible in the interior is the terrible touch-sensitive media buttons on the steering wheel, which have replaced Mercedes-Benz’s old five-way controllers. Brush against them accidentally and you’ll adjust something whether you wanted to or not. I think it’s lunacy to have any place on the steering wheel that you can’t touch or where you need to avoid resting your hands. Mercedes can’t get rid of these fast enough.\n\nPerfectly Safe\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the E63 wagon, but it has rated a similar 2018 E-Class sedan, deeming it “good” across the board. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the E-Class wagon a five-star rating.\n\nThis being a loaded Mercedes-Benz, the E63 has all of the company’s latest and greatest electronic safety minders. The optional AMG Premium Package includes all kinds of goodies: adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, 360-degree cameras, a head-up display and one of the more advanced semi-autonomous driving systems on the market.\n\nYou can set the E63’s cruise control to steer for you, provided lane markings are clear, and even briefly take your hands off the wheel. Using the turn-signal stalk, it can even change lanes on its own, using the car’s sensors to detect overtaking traffic and proceeding when it’s safe to do so. The car will summon your attention now and then, depending on road conditions and speed, requiring you to touch the steering wheel to let it know you’re still awake and present. The only system out there that’s better is Cadillac’s Super Cruise, which uses cameras and attention monitors to determine the driver’s attentiveness, allowing for totally hands-free control on approved highways.\n\nPerfectly Priced … for Some\n\nIf only Mercedes-Benz saw fit to price the E63 wagon like a Toyota Camry, then I could truly declare this the perfect all-around car. Alas, no such luck — the as-tested sticker price on this bad boy was $127,500 including destination fee, which is a lot of money for a mid-size family wagon. It’s an eminently reasonable sum, however, for a balls-to-the-wall V-8 supercar. It starts at an only-slightly-more-sensible $107,945, but necessary options add up fast. The Premium Package, which includes those safety systems, adds $3,600, and the Acoustic Package, with the extra sound insulation, adds $1,100. You could justify the $1,250 AMG Performance Exhaust, but the rest of our tester’s price jump was purely for cosmetic add-ons — things like carbon-fiber dress-up kits, black trim and exhaust pipes, different wheels, even a carbon-fiber engine cover for $1,500. Silly. Stick to the essentials and save the rest of that cash for your first few fuel stops, or for a dedicated set of winter wheels and tires.\n\nCompetitors, such as they are, cost about the same. First of all, there are no other high-performance wagons on the American market. None. If you want something from a competitor that can go this fast and carry five people and luggage, you’re getting an SUV. Mercedes-Benz sells several, like the AMG GLE63, the GLS63 if you want to go a size up or the G63 if you want box-shaped insanity on wheels. Porsche has several levels of Cayenne that can challenge the E63 wagon, while Maserati has just introduced two new versions of the often-overlooked Levante SUV that can do the same: the GTS and Trofeo. Compare some of them here.\n\nFor my money, the rarity of the E63 wagon, the packaging, the handling characteristics and all the unique elements add up to something more special than a go-fast SUV. It’s as much a statement as it is a transportation device: It says you didn’t just buy this off a lot or get it on a great lease special. It says you know what you’re doing — and you’re doing something ridiculously fun.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is available in four body styles and has a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder, six-cylinder and V-8 powertrains. The E350 has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 255 horsepower and the E450 gets a 362-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder. The high-performance AMG E53 has a 429-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder, while the line-topping AMG E63 boasts a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 with 603 hp. Stately and refined, the E350 and E450 blend a silky ride with reasonably sporty handling. The E450 All-Terrain wagon adds a modicum of off-road capability via an adjustable air suspension and SUV-style lower body cladding. The range-topping AMG models are outrageously quick, but they command commensurately lofty prices. E-Class rivals include the Audi A6,  BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Lexus ES.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class arrives in its many permutations with no significant updates or changes. A redesigned E-Class is slated to debut for the 2024 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nDual-zone climate control\nHands-free trunk lid\nHeated front seats\nTwo USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n360-degree parking camera  system\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\n23-speaker Burmester audio system\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAMG sport exhaust\nPower soft-close doors\nHeated rear seats\nInterior air purifier\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class should definitely make the shopping list of someone looking for a posh mid-size luxury vehicle. It offers a good balance between ride quality and handling even if a little more sparkle in terms of steering feel would be a welcome addition. The standard turbo four is perfectly fine in terms of acceleration and economy, but the silky nature of the turbo six-cylinder and extra grip from the available all-wheel-drive system are smart upgrades. Yes, the twin-turbo V-8 is a blast, but its high price and thirst for fuel are significant hurdles.",

      "expert_review": "Not too long ago, I wrote an article about how the Mercedes-Benz E400 wagon should be your next Mercedes-Benz. I extolled the virtues of its fine interior, the spacious cabin, the smooth and highly responsive turbocharged V-6 and nine-speed automatic. I said that its price tag, while lofty, was eminently reasonable for such a fine automobile, and that all these things made it the perfect model to buy if you were thinking about a new Benz. I also said that the more expensive, faster, more athletic E63 wagon really wasn’t necessary because the E400 was more than enough car.\n\nI was wrong. I was so wrong.\n\nAfter spending a week in the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon, I rescind the verdict I made about the lesser E400. That’s not the Benz you want; this is. Yes, it’s more expensive, to the tune of nearly $40,000 extra. But it’s also $40,000 better than the already outstanding E400 wagon. That extra cash gets you more than just a quicker car; it gets you one that can embarrass sports cars costing twice as much. It gets you a car that’s richly rewarding to drive, has an imposing physical presence and can carry five people and luggage to boot. And because it sits lower than an SUV, it doesn’t have the tippy, piggish handling characteristics of most go-fast family haulers.\n\nThe Perfect Looks\n\nStation wagons used to be big in this country, and they still are in most of the rest of the world. Americans’ love of SUVs has ended the reign of the family wagon, and that’s a shame. Just look at this beast: long lines stretching from front to back that accentuate a long, low profile — and that roofline is pure artistry. White is not this car’s best color, but it does help it fly under the radar when blasting down a highway. Nobody’s paying attention to the white station wagon; they’re all looking at the brightly colored sports coupes. Never mind that this family wagon can outperform nearly anything else on four wheels.\n\nThe E63’s wagon shape is part of its appeal. You can get it as a sedan, but for a few dollars more, you add that extra cargo room that makes it totally unique. Its 35 cubic feet is roughly triple the cargo volume of the sedan, plus you can drop the seats and get a cavernous 64 cubic feet of room — in a vehicle with a 603-horsepower V-8. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 has a little more cargo room at 38 cubic feet behind the backseat (expandable to a much larger 80.3 cubic feet thanks to its taller roof), but that mid-size performance SUV doesn’t match the E63 wagon’s performance numbers, probably because it’s over 500 pounds heavier.\n\nThe Perfect Drive\n\nThe E63’s weight advantage over the slightly larger but porkier GLE63 really comes out when you start to drive the E63 aggressively. The AMG Dynamic Select drive modes allow you to choose between several sport settings, plus an individual setting that allows you to customize different systems to your tastes. I generally kept things in Comfort mode, as the suspension is already as firm as I’d care to experience anywhere outside an Autobahn or dedicated racetrack. While not harsh or punishing, the E63 wagon’s softest suspension setting reminds you that this is not your average family hauler; it’s a supercar in drag.\n\nThe E63 is powered by Mercedes-AMG’s ubiquitous hand-built 4.0-liter V-8 engine. It now features new twin-scroll turbochargers for the first time and has been boosted to 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. Power is channeled through a dual-clutch nine-speed automatic transmission and now goes down to all four wheels via a new AMG Performance 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. The transmission can be left in automatic mode or shifted manually via paddles behind the steering wheel.\n\nDespite all that plumbing and the massive power on hand, the E63 drives as smooth as silk in all conditions. Leave it in Comfort mode and it won’t upset those bags of groceries in the cargo area in the slightest. Acceleration flows calmly and easily, the brakes are firm and progressive, and ride quality is acceptably firm. Even in the softest mode, the car’s steering feel is still communicative and tight — with no wallowing, no play, no vagueness to be found.\n\nAfter you’ve dropped off the groceries and your mother-in-law, of course, it’s time to have some fun, and fun is just a few knobs away. Slip the E63 into Sport or Sport Plus mode (leave Race for the track), and everything comes alive. Throttle response is immediate, shifts bang off with racecar precision, and steering feel goes from enjoyable to ridiculously accurate.\n\nMercedes says the big wagon sprints from zero-to-60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, matching the factory numbers from the 797-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye. The company hasn’t published any times for the GLE63 S SUV, but given that it doesn’t have as much power as the E63 and has two fewer gears and weighs considerably more, it’s no stretch to say the E63 wagon is quicker. I’d put it up against the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio — the only other SUV I’ve driven on a track and enjoyed — in terms of abilities. The turbocharged V-6 Stelvio is still down 100 hp and two cylinders from the E63 wagon, but it’s also smaller and lighter, and it feels that way when driven hard.\n\nThe E63’s fuel economy isn’t stellar, but considering what the car can do and what kind of equipment it’s packing, it’s more than acceptable — even superior to most of its SUV competitors. The EPA rates the E63 S wagon at 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week with it, which included several hundred miles of highway driving, netted 21.4 mpg, beating the combined rating. It also bests competing SUVs from BMW, Jeep and Land Rover thanks to its lower weight and standard cylinder deactivation.\n\nThe Perfect Interior\n\nOK, so maybe the interior of the S-Class is slightly more opulent, but the E-Class gives up almost nothing to its more expensive showroom sibling. It has the same high-quality controls, the same kinds of electronic displays, the same multimedia systems, even the same adjustable interior lighting offering 64 color combinations. Mercedes-Benz has done wonders at filtering the opulence of its most premium sedans down through its lineup, and the E63 is no exception. My test car was rather somberly done up in Nappa black leather with silver stitching, accented by black-ash wood trim — not the most adventurous color combination. (There are some much more appealing hues available.) It did, however, accent the sporting character of the car nicely.\n\nThe front seats are heavily bolstered, as they need to be to keep you in place should you ever take your E63 to a track. There’s more headroom for both front and backseat occupants in the E-Class wagon than there is in the sedan, even with the standard panoramic moonroof. Backseat legroom can be a little tight, as is typical of rear-drive German sports sedans, but the E63’s interior is extremely comfortable overall.\n\nIt’s also surprisingly quiet — a credit to the extra-cost insulation package my test vehicle was equipped with. The Acoustic Comfort Package added more sound insulation to the cabin, as well as an acoustic and thermal membrane to the windshield and side windows. There’s more noise than you’d hear in a sedan thanks to the wagon’s cavernous cargo area, but it’s mostly the glorious rumble of that unholy V-8 engine — which can get quite loud when you’ve pushed the button to open up the exhaust’s butterfly valves.\n\nThe only foible in the interior is the terrible touch-sensitive media buttons on the steering wheel, which have replaced Mercedes-Benz’s old five-way controllers. Brush against them accidentally and you’ll adjust something whether you wanted to or not. I think it’s lunacy to have any place on the steering wheel that you can’t touch or where you need to avoid resting your hands. Mercedes can’t get rid of these fast enough.\n\nPerfectly Safe\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the E63 wagon, but it has rated a similar 2018 E-Class sedan, deeming it “good” across the board. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the E-Class wagon a five-star rating.\n\nThis being a loaded Mercedes-Benz, the E63 has all of the company’s latest and greatest electronic safety minders. The optional AMG Premium Package includes all kinds of goodies: adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, 360-degree cameras, a head-up display and one of the more advanced semi-autonomous driving systems on the market.\n\nYou can set the E63’s cruise control to steer for you, provided lane markings are clear, and even briefly take your hands off the wheel. Using the turn-signal stalk, it can even change lanes on its own, using the car’s sensors to detect overtaking traffic and proceeding when it’s safe to do so. The car will summon your attention now and then, depending on road conditions and speed, requiring you to touch the steering wheel to let it know you’re still awake and present. The only system out there that’s better is Cadillac’s Super Cruise, which uses cameras and attention monitors to determine the driver’s attentiveness, allowing for totally hands-free control on approved highways.\n\nPerfectly Priced … for Some\n\nIf only Mercedes-Benz saw fit to price the E63 wagon like a Toyota Camry, then I could truly declare this the perfect all-around car. Alas, no such luck — the as-tested sticker price on this bad boy was $127,500 including destination fee, which is a lot of money for a mid-size family wagon. It’s an eminently reasonable sum, however, for a balls-to-the-wall V-8 supercar. It starts at an only-slightly-more-sensible $107,945, but necessary options add up fast. The Premium Package, which includes those safety systems, adds $3,600, and the Acoustic Package, with the extra sound insulation, adds $1,100. You could justify the $1,250 AMG Performance Exhaust, but the rest of our tester’s price jump was purely for cosmetic add-ons — things like carbon-fiber dress-up kits, black trim and exhaust pipes, different wheels, even a carbon-fiber engine cover for $1,500. Silly. Stick to the essentials and save the rest of that cash for your first few fuel stops, or for a dedicated set of winter wheels and tires.\n\nCompetitors, such as they are, cost about the same. First of all, there are no other high-performance wagons on the American market. None. If you want something from a competitor that can go this fast and carry five people and luggage, you’re getting an SUV. Mercedes-Benz sells several, like the AMG GLE63, the GLS63 if you want to go a size up or the G63 if you want box-shaped insanity on wheels. Porsche has several levels of Cayenne that can challenge the E63 wagon, while Maserati has just introduced two new versions of the often-overlooked Levante SUV that can do the same: the GTS and Trofeo. Compare some of them here.\n\nFor my money, the rarity of the E63 wagon, the packaging, the handling characteristics and all the unique elements add up to something more special than a go-fast SUV. It’s as much a statement as it is a transportation device: It says you didn’t just buy this off a lot or get it on a great lease special. It says you know what you’re doing — and you’re doing something ridiculously fun.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was updated Jan. 4, 2021, to add our impressions of the 2021 Mercedes-Benz E450 coupe.\n\nThe verdict: It will cost you a pretty penny, but the revised 2021 E-Class continues to be the standard by which other mid-size luxury cars are judged — few brands make a finer automobile than this.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s a cutthroat segment, but the E-Class is the benchmark in it, with the most luxurious interior in the mid-size luxury class, highly competitive powertrains and better technology than most. \n\nMercedes-Benz’s mid-size luxury car is the E-Class. Globally, it’s one of the company’s most popular models, available in a number of different body styles — from the sedans you see here to a wagon, a coupe, a convertible, a high-performance model and even a new lifted off-road wagon in the vein of a Audi Allroad, Subaru Outback or Volvo V90 Cross Country. For 2021, the E-Class gets a few updates to keep it in line with the rest of the brand’s showroom. We took a refreshed E450 4Matic sedan and high-performance E63 S for a spin to see what the updates for the ’21 model year have done to keep the E-Class fresh, and then followed up with an E450 4Matic coupe.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: New Face, New Wagon\n\nUnderstated Good Looks\n\nFrom a styling standpoint, you’d be forgiven if you have trouble spotting the 2021 model over the 2020. The differences are subtle, and mostly limited to the front and rear styling. The front gets new headlights, a new grille, new bumper and new hood, all meant to link the E-Class with the company’s SUV styling. This is the same look we can see on the GLA, GLC, GLE and GLS SUVs, and now it’s appearing on the company’s cars as well. There are some new wheel patterns, including on my test E450 that wore the lovely black 19-inch optional rollers Mercedes slapped an AMG badge on so it can charge more money. Out back, there are new taillights with new LED patterns, but overall the styling changes to the car aren’t huge. That’s OK; there’s nothing ostentatious or offensive in the design, and while it’s not exactly all that distinctive, it is clean, safe and respectable, which is generally what the buyers of the E-Class tend to be looking for in a luxury sedan. \n\nStill the Luxury Benchmark\n\nThe changes to the inside are similarly subtle, and generally revolve around new equipment and technology instead of styling. First off, the twin 12.3-inch digital screens are now standard on all E-Class models, providing a reconfigurable instrument cluster behind the wheel and a touch panel control display to the right of that. It’s running the latest MBUX multimedia system, featuring an expanded list of voice controls, gesture controls and an optional augmented reality feature for the standard navigation system that throws digital arrows up over a real-time video display of what’s in front of you. \n\nThe biggest interior changes come in two areas: the steering wheel and its relation to some new features for the semi-autonomous driving systems. First, the wheel: This new three-spoke model has expanded capacitive-touch-sensitive areas on the spokes to control various functions of the gauge cluster, cruise control and multimedia system. I have to say I wasn’t a big fan of the last-generation wheel because it was much too easy to brush against the sensitive controllers and change a display, or switch tracks, or adjust volume … and this new wheel is no better. In fact, it may be worse, as there are now more areas of the steering wheel you simply cannot touch unless you intend to change something. Mercedes-Benz is forcing you to maintain absolutely proper hand-position on the rim of the steering wheel — no steering via the spokes and no resting your hand there, either. Gotta keep it at 10 and 2, folks.\n\nThe changes to the semi-autonomous driving systems now rely more on you having your hands on the rim of the wheel. Previously, when you activated Mercedes-Benz’s active steering and lane-keeping systems that steer the vehicle at highway speeds, you weren’t able to take your hands off the wheel for any great length of time before the car would yell at you to make some minor steering adjustment to prove you were still actively engaged in the driving experience. This differs from systems like Tesla’s Autopilot or Cadillac’s Super Cruise that allow for hands-free driving, but Mercedes wasn’t quite ready to allow you to do that yet. For 2021, you no longer have to make periodic steering inputs to prove that you’re awake and paying attention, but you do have to keep your hands on the wheel. A sensor in the steering wheel rim detects if you’re touching it or not; that’s apparently now enough for the active steering systems to allow them to keep steering on the highway.\n\nThe rest of the interior is pretty much the same opulent, high-end luxury cabin we’ve enjoyed on the E-Class for years now. The leather trim looks, smells and feels rich; the switches all move with a mechanical precision; and there isn’t an overwhelming push toward touch-sensitive panels (aside from the frustrating steering wheel controls). But perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this E450’s cabin is the quietness: My test car had an optional Acoustic Comfort Package, which ups the amount of sound insulation in the body and changes out the glass for acoustically absorbent types, and the results are amazing. Cruising along back roads at 50 mph, the loudest thing you hear are the optional ventilated seat fans. There’s almost no wind noise at all, very little powertrain noise and only the faintest of bumps and rumbles from the tires. This isolation contributes greatly to the overall luxury experience of the E-Class and is worth every penny of the $1,100 that Mercedes-Benz charges for this package.\n\nChoose Your Path: Smooth and Quiet …\n\nYou’d think that this isolation would make the E-Class boring to drive, but that’s not the case. It’s a paragon of automotive refinement and perhaps one of the best examples of the stereotypical German luxury sedan on the road today. The base car is actually the rear-wheel-drive E350, powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 255 horsepower. Our test sedan and coupe, however, were both a step up from that: the mid-level E450 4Matic. It’s powered by a super smooth turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a formidable 362 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is augmented by a mild-hybrid system that Mercedes-Benz calls EQ Boost, essentially a hefty starter-generator that runs on the E-Class’ 48-volt electrical system, and can add as much as 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque in sudden on-demand bursts. That means that this E450 is both smooth and quick when it needs to be, with Mercedes-Benz quoting a 0-60-mph time of 5.2 seconds for the rear-wheel-drive coupe, and 4Matic all-wheel drive shaving it down to 4.9 seconds for the coupe and sedan. The 4Matic system helps keep traction at its maximum, and shifting duty is handled by the flawless nine-speed automatic transmission. Our test cars featured the optional Air Body Control air suspension system, which allows for more adjustability in the various drive modes that the car offers.\n\nThose drive modes do make a difference when combined with the air suspension. In the softest comfort mode, the E450 glides over surface imperfections without disturbing occupants but still maintains decent body roll control on curvy roads. Flip it into Sport or Sport Plus modes and the ride firms up, the steering gets heavier, and the throttle becomes much more responsive. It’s as if the E450 has two distinct personalities: a relaxed grand touring sedan that’s happy to coddle its passengers as it eats up mile after highway mile, and an entertaining European sports sedan with plenty of immediate, on-demand torque, beautifully balanced steering and a communicative chassis. But make no mistake, the E450 is definitely skewed toward the luxury end of the class, with its emphasis more on being comfortable for its occupants than being some kind of aggressive sports sedan. Even though coupes have a sportier reputation and the E450 4Matic coupe’s wheelbase is shorter than the sedan’s by 2.6 inches, it rides as comfortably and has the same dual personality. In fact, the biggest practical difference we found in the coupe was a smaller but surprisingly accommodating backseat that’s usable by any adult who’s willing to make the effort to get in and out of it — and it is an effort, despite front seats that motor forward to clear the way.\n\n… or Big and Boisterous\n\nNow, if you want an E-Class that’s meant to be a driver’s car, you’ll likely instead want this: the new Mercedes-AMG E63 S. It’s the hot performance version of the E-Class, swapping out the already powerful and responsive six-cylinder for a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine pumping out a massive 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a nine-speed Speedshift automatic transmission with electronic clutch replacing a traditional torque converter, and it sends power to all four wheels via Mercedes’ 4Matic AWD system. The suspension is a sport-tuned version of the Air Body Control system, and AMG included all kinds of other parts to help the E63 go fast, such as a performance exhaust system, special AMG drive modes, an electronic rear limited-slip differential and even dynamic motor mounts to help the car’s weight balance and distribution in hard-driving situations. \n\nThe result is an absolute beast, the Mr. Hyde to the lesser E450’s Dr. Jekyll — a four-door muscle car that rumbles and roars like a barroom brawler, but that can dance like a prizefighting boxer. Mercedes-Benz estimates that the E63 S can rocket from 0-60 mph in just 3.3 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 186 mph, and it only takes a few stabs at the accelerator to realize this isn’t meritless boasting. The E63’s ride is firmer than the E450, and of course the whole car is significantly louder (despite having an optional acoustic glass comfort package), from the exhaust note to the tire noise, but that’s just expected when you turn the craziness dial up to 11 as AMG has done here. \n\nDriving through the suburbs at lower cruising speeds, the specially tuned nine-speed Speedshift AMG transmission isn’t the smoothest operator. But when roads get curvy, it’s an absolute riot. The steering requires some effort but rewards you with precision and excellent feedback. The optional carbon-ceramic brakes feel strong enough to pull the color out of your irises if you stomp on them hard enough, and they’ll do it all day long with no fade at all — and most amazingly, with no low-speed, cold-brake squeal like other carbon-ceramic systems. I never had the opportunity to explore the E63’s new Drift Mode, as such things are best left to racetracks, but the fact that the car actually has such an electronic function speaks to its mission of being a hooligan in a matte-gray suit.\n\n… Ah yes, that matte paint. It’s one of the Designo Magno paint options for the E63, and it’s not really something I enjoy. To me, it looks as if Mercedes-Benz primered a perfectly lovely E63 and then forgot to apply the actual paint. It’s also something of a maintenance hog because you can’t wax it, but you also have to be careful washing it. No automated brush car washes (touchless only), no polishes, and don’t even rub it too hard with a towel lest you create a shiny spot. It’s not the only visual difference between the E63 and lesser E-Class models: The bodywork is different, featuring a new front end with all-LED headlights and a new grille and lower bumper that look a lot more aggressive than the E450. The E63 also has a wider body with flared wheel arches to cover the bigger wheels and tires, plus a revised rear end for 2021. This one comes with the optional Night Package, which brings high-gloss black trim like the front splitter, mirror housings, fender inserts, window frame trim and more.\n\nThings are equally amped up inside with the big news again being the new steering wheel — but a different one than the E450 has. In the E63 S, it has twin horizontal spokes but the same revised capacitive-touch-sensitive controls that mean you can only really hold the wheel by the rim when driving. The AMG wheel also has two rotary button controllers to change all sorts of settings from drive mode to exhaust function to ESP deactivation. They’re convenient, as they don’t require you to go hunting through various menus to change some settings or quickly activate or deactivate various systems, and I have to admit they also look pretty cool at the bottom of the steering wheel. The rest of the interior is just as nice as any other E-Class, but it comes with even more luxurious appointments, such as standard Nappa leather covering aggressively bolstered sport seats and optional carbon-fiber trim.\n\nExceptional Products Don’t Come Cheap\n\nNone of this technological excellence comes cheap, of course. The E-Class is not the price leader in its segment, but that’s true of most Mercedes-Benz models. The base price for the least expensive E350 in the sedan lineup starts at $55,300 (all prices include destination). Our E450 4Matic sedan was a step up from that and starts at $63,050, but all manner of option packages and electronic goodies saw that price climb on our tester to an eye-popping $81,950. There’s an E53 sedan if you want some of the go-fast goodies that AMG offers ($74,950 to start), but the big daddy E63 S test car we enjoyed starts at a whopping $108,550 before all the options were added. After those options were tallied up, the total manufacturer’s asking price for our E63 S test car was a lofty $136,290. Ouch.\n\nThe coupe will cost you more than the sedan, on different grounds. For one thing, it starts at the E450 level, not the E350, so even though it has rear-wheel drive standard, its $66,000 base price is well above the E350 sedan’s $55,300. But even if you choose the optional 4Matic, the E450 coupe is $68,500, premium-priced over the $63,050 E450 4Matic sedan. As with the sedan, our test coupe was optioned up to $78,580.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Not too long ago, I wrote an article about how the Mercedes-Benz E400 wagon should be your next Mercedes-Benz. I extolled the virtues of its fine interior, the spacious cabin, the smooth and highly responsive turbocharged V-6 and nine-speed automatic. I said that its price tag, while lofty, was eminently reasonable for such a fine automobile, and that all these things made it the perfect model to buy if you were thinking about a new Benz. I also said that the more expensive, faster, more athletic E63 wagon really wasn’t necessary because the E400 was more than enough car.\n\nI was wrong. I was so wrong.\n\nAfter spending a week in the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E63 S wagon, I rescind the verdict I made about the lesser E400. That’s not the Benz you want; this is. Yes, it’s more expensive, to the tune of nearly $40,000 extra. But it’s also $40,000 better than the already outstanding E400 wagon. That extra cash gets you more than just a quicker car; it gets you one that can embarrass sports cars costing twice as much. It gets you a car that’s richly rewarding to drive, has an imposing physical presence and can carry five people and luggage to boot. And because it sits lower than an SUV, it doesn’t have the tippy, piggish handling characteristics of most go-fast family haulers.\n\nThe Perfect Looks\n\nStation wagons used to be big in this country, and they still are in most of the rest of the world. Americans’ love of SUVs has ended the reign of the family wagon, and that’s a shame. Just look at this beast: long lines stretching from front to back that accentuate a long, low profile — and that roofline is pure artistry. White is not this car’s best color, but it does help it fly under the radar when blasting down a highway. Nobody’s paying attention to the white station wagon; they’re all looking at the brightly colored sports coupes. Never mind that this family wagon can outperform nearly anything else on four wheels.\n\nThe E63’s wagon shape is part of its appeal. You can get it as a sedan, but for a few dollars more, you add that extra cargo room that makes it totally unique. Its 35 cubic feet is roughly triple the cargo volume of the sedan, plus you can drop the seats and get a cavernous 64 cubic feet of room — in a vehicle with a 603-horsepower V-8. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 has a little more cargo room at 38 cubic feet behind the backseat (expandable to a much larger 80.3 cubic feet thanks to its taller roof), but that mid-size performance SUV doesn’t match the E63 wagon’s performance numbers, probably because it’s over 500 pounds heavier.\n\nThe Perfect Drive\n\nThe E63’s weight advantage over the slightly larger but porkier GLE63 really comes out when you start to drive the E63 aggressively. The AMG Dynamic Select drive modes allow you to choose between several sport settings, plus an individual setting that allows you to customize different systems to your tastes. I generally kept things in Comfort mode, as the suspension is already as firm as I’d care to experience anywhere outside an Autobahn or dedicated racetrack. While not harsh or punishing, the E63 wagon’s softest suspension setting reminds you that this is not your average family hauler; it’s a supercar in drag.\n\nThe E63 is powered by Mercedes-AMG’s ubiquitous hand-built 4.0-liter V-8 engine. It now features new twin-scroll turbochargers for the first time and has been boosted to 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. Power is channeled through a dual-clutch nine-speed automatic transmission and now goes down to all four wheels via a new AMG Performance 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. The transmission can be left in automatic mode or shifted manually via paddles behind the steering wheel.\n\nDespite all that plumbing and the massive power on hand, the E63 drives as smooth as silk in all conditions. Leave it in Comfort mode and it won’t upset those bags of groceries in the cargo area in the slightest. Acceleration flows calmly and easily, the brakes are firm and progressive, and ride quality is acceptably firm. Even in the softest mode, the car’s steering feel is still communicative and tight — with no wallowing, no play, no vagueness to be found.\n\nAfter you’ve dropped off the groceries and your mother-in-law, of course, it’s time to have some fun, and fun is just a few knobs away. Slip the E63 into Sport or Sport Plus mode (leave Race for the track), and everything comes alive. Throttle response is immediate, shifts bang off with racecar precision, and steering feel goes from enjoyable to ridiculously accurate.\n\nMercedes says the big wagon sprints from zero-to-60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, matching the factory numbers from the 797-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye. The company hasn’t published any times for the GLE63 S SUV, but given that it doesn’t have as much power as the E63 and has two fewer gears and weighs considerably more, it’s no stretch to say the E63 wagon is quicker. I’d put it up against the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio — the only other SUV I’ve driven on a track and enjoyed — in terms of abilities. The turbocharged V-6 Stelvio is still down 100 hp and two cylinders from the E63 wagon, but it’s also smaller and lighter, and it feels that way when driven hard.\n\nThe E63’s fuel economy isn’t stellar, but considering what the car can do and what kind of equipment it’s packing, it’s more than acceptable — even superior to most of its SUV competitors. The EPA rates the E63 S wagon at 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week with it, which included several hundred miles of highway driving, netted 21.4 mpg, beating the combined rating. It also bests competing SUVs from BMW, Jeep and Land Rover thanks to its lower weight and standard cylinder deactivation.\n\nThe Perfect Interior\n\nOK, so maybe the interior of the S-Class is slightly more opulent, but the E-Class gives up almost nothing to its more expensive showroom sibling. It has the same high-quality controls, the same kinds of electronic displays, the same multimedia systems, even the same adjustable interior lighting offering 64 color combinations. Mercedes-Benz has done wonders at filtering the opulence of its most premium sedans down through its lineup, and the E63 is no exception. My test car was rather somberly done up in Nappa black leather with silver stitching, accented by black-ash wood trim — not the most adventurous color combination. (There are some much more appealing hues available.) It did, however, accent the sporting character of the car nicely.\n\nThe front seats are heavily bolstered, as they need to be to keep you in place should you ever take your E63 to a track. There’s more headroom for both front and backseat occupants in the E-Class wagon than there is in the sedan, even with the standard panoramic moonroof. Backseat legroom can be a little tight, as is typical of rear-drive German sports sedans, but the E63’s interior is extremely comfortable overall.\n\nIt’s also surprisingly quiet — a credit to the extra-cost insulation package my test vehicle was equipped with. The Acoustic Comfort Package added more sound insulation to the cabin, as well as an acoustic and thermal membrane to the windshield and side windows. There’s more noise than you’d hear in a sedan thanks to the wagon’s cavernous cargo area, but it’s mostly the glorious rumble of that unholy V-8 engine — which can get quite loud when you’ve pushed the button to open up the exhaust’s butterfly valves.\n\nThe only foible in the interior is the terrible touch-sensitive media buttons on the steering wheel, which have replaced Mercedes-Benz’s old five-way controllers. Brush against them accidentally and you’ll adjust something whether you wanted to or not. I think it’s lunacy to have any place on the steering wheel that you can’t touch or where you need to avoid resting your hands. Mercedes can’t get rid of these fast enough.\n\nPerfectly Safe\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the E63 wagon, but it has rated a similar 2018 E-Class sedan, deeming it “good” across the board. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the E-Class wagon a five-star rating.\n\nThis being a loaded Mercedes-Benz, the E63 has all of the company’s latest and greatest electronic safety minders. The optional AMG Premium Package includes all kinds of goodies: adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, 360-degree cameras, a head-up display and one of the more advanced semi-autonomous driving systems on the market.\n\nYou can set the E63’s cruise control to steer for you, provided lane markings are clear, and even briefly take your hands off the wheel. Using the turn-signal stalk, it can even change lanes on its own, using the car’s sensors to detect overtaking traffic and proceeding when it’s safe to do so. The car will summon your attention now and then, depending on road conditions and speed, requiring you to touch the steering wheel to let it know you’re still awake and present. The only system out there that’s better is Cadillac’s Super Cruise, which uses cameras and attention monitors to determine the driver’s attentiveness, allowing for totally hands-free control on approved highways.\n\nPerfectly Priced … for Some\n\nIf only Mercedes-Benz saw fit to price the E63 wagon like a Toyota Camry, then I could truly declare this the perfect all-around car. Alas, no such luck — the as-tested sticker price on this bad boy was $127,500 including destination fee, which is a lot of money for a mid-size family wagon. It’s an eminently reasonable sum, however, for a balls-to-the-wall V-8 supercar. It starts at an only-slightly-more-sensible $107,945, but necessary options add up fast. The Premium Package, which includes those safety systems, adds $3,600, and the Acoustic Package, with the extra sound insulation, adds $1,100. You could justify the $1,250 AMG Performance Exhaust, but the rest of our tester’s price jump was purely for cosmetic add-ons — things like carbon-fiber dress-up kits, black trim and exhaust pipes, different wheels, even a carbon-fiber engine cover for $1,500. Silly. Stick to the essentials and save the rest of that cash for your first few fuel stops, or for a dedicated set of winter wheels and tires.\n\nCompetitors, such as they are, cost about the same. First of all, there are no other high-performance wagons on the American market. None. If you want something from a competitor that can go this fast and carry five people and luggage, you’re getting an SUV. Mercedes-Benz sells several, like the AMG GLE63, the GLS63 if you want to go a size up or the G63 if you want box-shaped insanity on wheels. Porsche has several levels of Cayenne that can challenge the E63 wagon, while Maserati has just introduced two new versions of the often-overlooked Levante SUV that can do the same: the GTS and Trofeo. Compare some of them here.\n\nFor my money, the rarity of the E63 wagon, the packaging, the handling characteristics and all the unique elements add up to something more special than a go-fast SUV. It’s as much a statement as it is a transportation device: It says you didn’t just buy this off a lot or get it on a great lease special. It says you know what you’re doing — and you’re doing something ridiculously fun.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
