It competes with the Land Rover Range Rover. High-performance AMG variants also are available.\n\nNew for 2016\nMercedes offers a new G65 AMG performance model that’s powered by a handcrafted turbocharged V-12 engine, and the base G550 gets a new turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 416 hp. An adaptive suspension is now available for the G550.\n\nSignificant Standard Features\n\n416-hp, turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine\nSeven-speed automatic transmission\nFour-wheel drive\nTwo-speed transfer case\nThree locking differentials\n8.1 inches of ground clearance\nLED daytime running lights and bi-xenon headlamps\nHeated windshield\nComand multimedia system\nNavigation system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHarman Kardon surround-sound stereo\nBackup camera\nBlind spot warning system\nAdaptive cruise control with full-stop capability\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\nCarbon fiber trim\nHeated steering wheel\nRear entertainment system",
