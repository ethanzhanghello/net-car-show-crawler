      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi S3, BMW 230i, Lexus IS 350\n\nLooks like: A touched-up version of the standard CLA that will take a keen eye to tell apart from its near-twin\n\nPowertrain: 302-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 295 pounds-feet of torque; seven-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2019\n\nMercedes-Benz has announced the next member of its AMG high-performance lineup, the 2020 AMG CLA35, which will debut at the 2019 New York International Auto Show to become the sportiest variant of the CLA-Class. The CLA got a full redesign for 2020, which was a bit of a surprise — with the A-Class sedan coming to American shores for 2019, I thought that might be the end of the line for the four-door coupe.\n\nRelated: More New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nInstead, Mercedes has doubled down, and the pair now form an entry point to the Mercedes lineup. The CLA35 follows the A35 — also set to debut as a 2020 model — and the two vehicles will share the same powertrain, interior features and technology, as well.\n\nExterior\n\nStyling is pretty toned down for an AMG model. The CLA35 keeps the same swooping roofline and curvy aesthetic to its styling, especially when seen in profile. There is some additional detailing for the CLA35, especially up front where the lower bumper inlets have chrome detailing and the grille features two bars instead of one. The rear adds a small spoiler lip, diffuser and a pair of exhaust pipes.\n\nWheels come in 18-inch (standard) or 19-inch (optional) sizes.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior looks to be a standout on the CLA35, with standard 64-color ambient lighting and a few two-tone seat upholstery options that make the cabin feel more sporty. Up front, the dashboard is dominated by a pair of screens positioned right next to each other to form a single continuous display for the driver — one for the instrument gauges, while the other controls the car’s multimedia functions.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s latest MBUX infotainment system is optional, which allows many of the car’s functions to be controlled via voice commands. The car can then be treated as a digital assistant, cued by the phrase “Hey, Mercedes.” The CLA35 also offers an AMG Track Pace system that allows the driver to track lap times, vehicle telemetry and other data, all within the multimedia screen.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPower comes from a 302-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 295 pounds-feet of torque. All-wheel drive comes standard, as does a seven-speed automatic transmission, which is the only available gearbox. This is a front-biased AWD system, but torque can be split 50/50 between the front and rear wheels when needed. Mercedes-Benz estimates a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.6 seconds, which is a tenth of a second better than the A35 (suck exhaust fumes, sedan!).\n\nThere are five drive modes: Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus and Individual, with which drivers can tune the various systems to their liking. Slippery is a new addition, meant for low-grip, icy conditions. Mercedes will offer an adaptive suspension on the CLA35, which comes with three suspension settings for different conditions, as well.\n\nNo pricing information has been released for the 2020 CLA35. Mercedes says the coupe will reach dealerships in late 2019. We’ll have our team of automotive journalists at the 2019 New York auto show where the CLA35 is set to debut, so be sure to check back in with us often for all our coverage straight from the show floor.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The sport-oriented 2024 Mercedes-AMG CLA35 is purpose-built for driving excitement, and it delivers on some fronts. Spirited acceleration and agile handling are highlights, but downsides include its high price, low visibility, a punishing ride and a useless backseat.\n\nVersus the competition: Other cars in the compact luxury sedan class do a better job delivering a sporty driving experience and a bit of practicality — and they do it for less money.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe (which is actually a sedan — more on that later) got some updates for 2024, including a mild-hybrid powertrain. Other changes include an all-new infotainment screen and digital instrument cluster pairing, as well as some styling tweaks, including redesigned LED headlights, a revamped front grille, a new rear diffuser design and standard LED taillights. Compare 2024 and 2023 versions of the AMG CLA35 here.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe Gets Makeover, Debuts Hybrid\n\nThe AMG CLA35 competes in the compact luxury sedan class against the likes of the Audi S3 and BMW M235i Gran Coupe; see them compared.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nFast but Awkward\n\nThe sport-oriented AMG CLA35 that I tested sits between the CLA250 and the more performance-oriented AMG CLA45 S in the Mercedes-AMG lineup. There are pros and cons about its driving experience, including acceleration as a big upside. Power comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 302 horsepower — 81 hp more than the base CLA250, but 114 hp less than the performance-oriented AMG 45 S. New this year is a mild-hybrid component for the four-cylinder powertrain, comprising a 48-volt electrical system and belt-driven starter-generator that add an extra 13 hp. An AMG Performance version of Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is standard.\n\nPower is brisk from a stop, and the exhaust note is aggressive to match; they’re a dynamic pair. Pop the AMG drive-mode system into Sport or Sport+ for an even livelier response. It alters transmission shift points, engine response and steering tuning for a more dialed-in, sportier feel. Mercedes estimates the AMG CLA35 can sprint from 0-60 mph in 4.8 seconds.\n\nIt’s fast, but it’s also awkward; I’m not a fan of the clunky eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. At low speeds, the transmission’s shifts are abrupt and jerky, so driving smoothly is tough and the jumpiness gets old fast. The drivetrain settles down at higher speeds, but it’s not enough to make up for its low-speed fumblings.\n\nWhile the CLA35 feels very maneuverable, with firm, direct steering and a tight turning circle, its AMG sport suspension is too firm for my liking. The ride suffers; the sedan was frequently unsettled over rough patches of Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, and overall isolation from the road was also poor, with intrusive levels of vibration and road noise bounding through the cabin.\n\nThe addition of a tiny bit of electrification for 2024 is welcome, but the AMG CLA35’s fuel economy is still not great. It earned an EPA rating of 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined — well below the regular CLA250’s 25/35/28 mpg rating with AWD.  It’s also less efficient than the 2024 S3 (23/32/26 mpg) and the 2024 M235i xDrive Gran Coupe (24/33/27 mpg), both of which also have AWD.\n\nWhat’s next for the CLA’s powertrain? Chances look good it’ll see even more electrification; the automaker debuted an electric Concept CLA Class in 2023 in Munich, Germany. Mercedes says it foreshadows a new family of all-electric entry-level vehicles, and the automaker calls the Concept CLA “close to production.”  \n\nPremium Interior, Cramped Quarters\n\nGetting in the AMG CLA35 is a low point, both figuratively and literally. The sedan’s low-slung shape requires a duck and twist motion to lower yourself in, and its thick B-pillar makes the door opening seem extra narrow.\n\nOnce inside, the vibe is premium. Everything looks and feels top-notch. Highlights include a standard Nappa leather steering wheel, suede-like microfiber upholstery with red contrast stitching, and brushed aluminum trim. I especially love the color-pop seatbelts, which add a jazzy dash of red to the cabin.\n\nBut the delightful cabin was only temporarily able to distract me from another problem: The CLA35 is difficult to see out of, both front and back. The steeply raked windshield limits forward visibility, and it’s even tougher to see out the rear window.\n\nDespite the AMG CLA35’s four doors, Mercedes calls it a coupe to highlight its swoopy roofline. The styling does add some visual drama to the car, but it’s bad for visibility. Thick pillars, small windows and the sloping roof add up to a challenging view out back.\n\nThe coupe-like roofline is felt in the backseat, too. There’s technically three seat belts, but only two small people will fit; headroom was in short supply for me, and I’m 5 feet, 6 inches tall. Legroom is not generous, either, and a giant center floor hump and the narrowness of the middle seat make that spot unusable. Measurement-wise, the AMG CLA35’s backseat headroom is similar to the M235i Gran Coupe’s but less than the S3’s. The same goes for the CLA35’s rear legroom.\n\nI installed car seats in this Mercedes’ backseat, and I don’t recommend it. While the CLA’s easy-access Latch anchors made installation easy, the lack of space was a problem, and the car seats majorly affected how much front-passenger legroom was available. Check out our full Car Seat Check for more details.\n\nThe CLA35s’ trunk, however, is decently sized. According to Mercedes-Benz’s measurements, there’s 11.6 cubic feet of trunk space, which is more than the S3 (8.3 cubic feet) but less than the M235i Gran Coupe (15.2 cubic feet). Numbers aside, I was able to fit several grocery bags in the Mercedes without a problem. There’s also a helpful standard hands-free power trunk lid that opens with a kick of your foot under the rear bumper.\n\nSlick Screens\n\nOne big bright spot is the CLA’s tech, highlighted by a modern-looking twin-screen dashboard that seamlessly pairs a 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen with a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel for a slick look.\n\nThe touchscreen is very responsive, with crisp graphics and no learning curve to figure out how to use the system. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration is standard.\n\nMost climate controls are easy to use and are arranged clearly under the center dashboard vents. One thing to note: The climate controls are very small on the touchscreen, but hitting a climate button allows them to take up the whole screen.\n\nThere were two features of the infotainment system that I enjoyed using, the first being an optional augmented-reality navigation system that displays real-time video and direction overlays simultaneously on the touchscreen. I found it handy to use, but it would be even more helpful if it could appear in the head-up display, as it does in some other Mercedes vehicles.\n\nThe second helpful feature was the voice command system. You can use a “Hey Mercedes” prompt to control a wide variety of features; I used it to navigate to the nearest Dunkin’, switch satellite radio stations and change the climate settings. Voice command systems in some cars can be finicky, but this one was spot-on every time.\n\nIn terms of other tech, the AMG CLA35 comes pretty well equipped with safety features. Standard features include forward automatic emergency braking, crosswind assist, front and rear parking sensors, blind spot warning and a driver attention monitor. A number of driver-assist systems, however, are optional.\n\nWho Is It Good For?\n\nI might be able to overlook some of the CLA35’s faults if its price were right, but it’s not. The 2024 Mercedes-AMG CLA35 starts at around $56,000, including destination. That’s well above the base CLA250’s starting price of around $44,000. The 2024 AMG CLA35’s starting price is also more than $5,000 higher than last year’s version, and it starts around $7,000-$8,000 more than the M235i Gran Coupe and S3.\n\nMy test car’s as-tested price of $63,500 included extras like an AMG Night Package, upgraded wheels, navigation and some additional driver-assist features that I expected to see standard, including Mercedes’ Distronic adaptive cruise control, which came bundled in an optional Driver Assistance Package.\n\nWhile the AMG CLA35 looks like a charmer inside and out, it’s worth taking a closer look. If you’re shopping for something that combines luxury and sportiness, but functionality and value are low on your list, the AMG CLA35 might work for you. Buyers looking for something a little more well rounded should pass.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG GT43 Coupe: Fours to Be Reckoned With\n577-HP 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Revealed\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe Starts at $57,650\n443-HP 2024 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Coupe Revealed\nShop for a 2024 Mercedes-AMG CLA35\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nThe cheapest car in Mercedes’ lineup, the CLA-Class is the brand’s gateway sedan, with vogue “coupe” styling and an expressive interior design that belie its entry-level positioning. Its powertrain lineup starts with a 221-horsepower four-cylinder in the front-wheel-drive CLA250 and the all-wheel-drive 250 4Matic, climbing to a 302-hp four-cylinder in the AMG CLA35, which comes standard with AWD. Atop the lineup is the AWD, 416-hp CLA45 S. CLA-Class competitors include the Acura Integra, Audi A3, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Cadillac CT4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nWith an all-new CLA-Class coming for 2026 — including an all-electric version as well as a hybrid version — the CLA sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n10.25-inch digital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nAutomated parking\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAdaptive dampers\nNavigation\nAugmented reality navigation\nHeated front seats\n12-speaker Burmester sound system\nHead-up display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot intervention\nEmergency steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nDespite its sporty appearance, the Mercedes-Benz CLA comports itself with all the refinement and comfort of a bigger Benz sedan — or at least non-AMG variants do. The AMG models ride on a stiffer suspension that’s cinched down for sharper handling. Both the regular and AMG models fulfill their missions admirably, but backseat space is snug — and many competitors are more affordable.",
