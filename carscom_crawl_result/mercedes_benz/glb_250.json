      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB is polished, poised and pretty, but as my kids ask over and over: “Why?” \n\nVersus the competition: In the ever-crowded luxury SUV field, there are a lot of pleasant choices that make it increasingly difficult for any one of them to stand out; for the nice-but-not-extraordinary GLB, its optional third row is the only thing that sets it apart.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB: A Baby Benz With a Postadolescent Price\n\nThe GLB is all-new for 2020, joining a very crowded Mercedes SUV lineup that’s punctuated by more than a couple GL-named vehicles. Following the alphabet, the GLB fits in the tiny slot between the GLA and GLC in size and price, but unlike them it has an optional, two-seat third row and a much boxier shape. The GLA is bigger and boxier for 2021, which will make the models more similar in size. See all three 2020 models compared. What the GLB is not is related to the Mercedes B-Class hatchback, a global vehicle sold only in all-electric form in the U.S. and discontinued here in 2017. \n\nThe GLB goes head to head with other similarly sized and priced luxury SUVs, like the Volvo XC60, and could also be compared with larger, more expensive models that offer an optional third row, such as the Land Rover Discovery and Lexus RX; see them compared.\n\nComfort Over Performance\n\nOverall, the GLB’s road manners are poised and comfortable but missing the sporty character you’d expect given its Mercedes pedigree and athletic styling.\n\nPower from a stop is punchy. The sole engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder good for 221 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s matched with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic that prefers higher speeds. Around town, shifts are clunky and timing is awkward, but at highway speeds it delivers steady power quickly and seamlessly. Popping it into Sport mode adds even more oomph off the line and firms up steering feel.\n\nA forthcoming AMG version will bump power to 302 hp and add a variety of performance-tuned equipment; the regular version skews more toward comfort than performance. The ride is good, with supple, bump-absorbing suspension tuning, but the handling feels very un-Mercedes. Its large turning circle and significant body lean lend it a lumbering, unsporty feel, especially around corners. My test model was equipped with the optional adaptive suspension ($990), which tightened things up a bit for a slightly crisper, more engaging drive.\n\nIt was also equipped with a semi-autonomous driver assistance system that combines radar adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering. The latter is among the most subtle and gentle systems I’ve tested — as opposed to some others whose lane corrections have more of a ping pong ball-type action.\n\nThe system was easy to engage or cancel via the touchscreen multimedia system and was useful, though it falls short of fully-autonomous systems I’ve tested, like Cadillac Super Cruise and BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant. Unlike these systems, Mercedes’ feature is not designed for complete hands-free operation; it triggers visual and audio alerts if it detects the removal of your hands.\n\nControl Overhaul\n\nWith so many automakers moving away from distracting track pads and controller knobs and toward giant touchscreen multimedia systems, I was leery of the GLB’s touchpad, but it’s just one of many ways the latest version of the Mercedes-Benz User Interface, or MBUX, can be controlled. Other ways include the central touchscreen, steering-wheel controls and the Hey Mercedes! voice activation.\n\nI’m biased toward the touchscreen, which I preferred to use most of the time. A 7.0-inch digital gauge display and 7.0-inch touchscreen (both measured diagonally) come standard; my car was equipped with optional dual 10.25-inch screens that stretched across the top of the dashboard; they looked modern and slick and were intuitive to use, with a few caveats.\n\nThe screen itself was responsive but didn’t include every function, so I occasionally had to pivot to the trackpad and its supporting buttons for things like opening the safety systems menu or going back to the home screen.\n\nOverall, the system’s menu structure is straightforward. Inputting a nav destination, for example, was simple, but some functions take more steps than they should, like saving an audio station preset. In comparison, I find Volvo’s system less complicated, but MBUX is definitely easier to figure out than the Lexus or Land Rover systems — the latter is a migraine in the making.\n\nThe GLB’s wide screen and large, clear graphics are great for visibility, but here again things get a little weird. Some functions, like the exterior camera and navigation, can be displayed side-by-side on the screen, which is helpful, but this arrangement doesn’t extend to other functions. It’d be helpful to have the screen split between navigation and audio, for example.\n\nI was especially wowed by the optional augmented-video component of the navigation system, which uses a forward-facing camera in tandem with the navigation system to display street names and directions on top of the video image.\n\nThere are also plenty of ways to link your phone: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, five USB-C ports and Bluetooth are standard; a wireless charging pad is a $200 option.\n\nRoom and Comfort\n\nAs expected, the GLB’s cabin delivers all the snazz you’d expect from a luxury vehicle. My car wore an upgraded red and black leather package with red contrast stitching and brushed metal trim; everything looked and felt top-notch. A switchable 64-color ambient lighting package added a pop of color.\n\nIn terms of space, it also didn’t disappoint. The front seats are comfortable, with lots of adjustability and cushioning. A low beltline and tall windows mean visibility from the driver’s seat is good.\n\nIn back, the second-row seats are firmer but room is still plentiful; they slide 6 inches to manage people and cargo room, as well as open up access to the third row (when equipped). I tested a two-row model, and Mercedes says its second row has 1.2 inches more legroom than the three-row version. At 38.1 inches, the two-row GLB just about matches the second rows of the Land Rover Discovery and Volvo XC60, and it’s much more than the Lexus RX 350L. The GLC offers a similar amount of rear legroom as the GLB. In rear headroom, the GLB offers just a smidge more than its competitors, including the GLC.\n\nThe backseat has two sets of lower Latch anchors, exposed for easy access and child-safety-seat attachment. Two car seats fit nicely, though our rear-facing ones required the front seats to be moved up a bit; taller occupants will need more space to be comfortable. Check out our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe backseat folds in a 40/20/40 split, more flexible than the usual 60/40 split — especially when hauling long, skinny items — and the cargo area is deep with a usefully wide opening. By the manufacturer’s numbers, a five-seat GLB has 20.1 cubic feet behind the second row and 62.0 cubic feet with the seatbacks folded.. That’s less than the Discovery but more than the RX 350L and XC60. In the three-row version, those figures are 56.7, 24.0 and 5.1 cubic feet behind the first, second and third rows, respectively.\n\nSafety and Dollars\n\nThe 2020 GLB starts at $37,595 in base, front-wheel-drive trim — much less than the larger Land Rover Discovery and Lexus RX 350L and a bit less than the similarly sized Volvo XC60 (all prices include destination). The optional third row is an additional $850. Although its base price is reasonable, options add up quickly if you want (expect?) luxury features like heated and ventilated seats ($1,030), a head-up display ($1,100), blind spot monitoring ($550) or the larger of the two available multimedia screens (bundled in a $2,200 Premium Package).\n\nActive brake assist automatic emergency braking is standard, and optional safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane keep assist with lane change assist, blind spot assist, and a park assist system. Many of them are bundled into the Driver Assistance Package ($2,250) or Parking Assistance Package ($1,090) and are not available as stand-alone options.\n\nThe GLB has a decent amount of both pros and cons, but is there a tip-the-scales reason to choose one? The answer lies with the third row. If you’re interested in a small Mercedes SUV with an optional third row, you have one choice: the GLB. If the third row isn’t necessary for you, there are a lot of other pleasant choices in the GLB’s price range.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB250 and GLB250 4Matic are slightly boxier, more practical offshoots of the automaker’s GLA subcompact SUV. The standard 221-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system and an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. This powertrain delivers a nice combination of peppy performance and reasonable fuel economy. If speed is what you’re after, the 302-hp turbo-four in the AMG GLB35 delivers the goods, but it’s significantly pricier. The GLB’s available third row is a definite bonus, but its dimensions are so cozy that it’s only suitable for small kids. The GLB’s rivals include the BMW X1, Genesis GV70, Mini Countryman and Volvo XC40. If you like the GLB but want an EV, check out the all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQB, which is built on the same platform as the GLB.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class?\n\nThe GLB-Class is carried over for 2025 with just a couple minor alterations. The GLB250 gets an optional Nite Package Lite that adds gloss-black exterior accents, and a 360-degree surround-view camera is now available as a stand-alone option.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nPower-adjustable heated front seats\nPower liftgate\n10.25-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB-C ports\nDual-zone climate control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nThird-row seating\nHeated steering wheel\n12-speaker Burmester audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB makes a safe play amid the increasingly crowded field of small luxury SUVs. The standard 221-hp, hybrid turbo-four offers strong acceleration, but the steering lacks the feedback you’ll find in some more nimble rivals. Perhaps the GLB’s biggest advantages consist of its available third-row seat and roomy cargo area. While those aren’t exactly the wildest or most romantic reasons for choosing a Mercedes-Benz SUV, they are valuable assets that help the GLB stand out in a wide field of tough competition.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLB SUV starts at $45,050 (all prices include $1,250 destination charge).\nThe GLB gets new exterior styling packages for all versions, as well as a new Sun & Sound package that bundles a panoramic moonroof and upgraded sound system.\nLuxury compact SUV with available three-row seating\n\nThe GLB is the small Mercedes-Benz SUV for people who want the unmistakable, upright SUV look. Unique among its competitive set, the GLB can be optioned with a third-row seat, although the wayback really only works for young children. For 2026, the GLB gets a few new packages and starts at $45,050.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 Review: It’s All About Expectations\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNew for the 2026 model year are a number of exterior design packages, as well as a Sun & Sound Package that includes a panoramic moonroof and 10-speaker sound system. On the GLB250, the Night Package adds black exterior bits including the front and rear bumper trim, grille crossbars, side mirror housings, window trim and roof rails. The Midnight Edition removes all exterior badging and includes the Night Package as well as 20-inch wheels and adaptive dampers.\n\nOn the AMG GLB35 variant, the new Design Package Plus features an exclusive nonmetallic gray paint, plus black finishes on the 19-inch wheels, lower bumpers, grille bars, side mirrors, window trim, sills, roof rails and badging. The package also includes black chrome exhaust tips.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLB is on sale now. Pricing is as follows, with 4Matic all-wheel drive an additional $2,000 on the GLB250:\n\nGLB250: $45,050\nAMG GLB35: $61,850\nTrim Levels\n\nThe GLB250 rides on 18-inch wheels and features LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, remote keyless entry and push-button start. Inside are synthetic leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel, and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEach GLB250 is also available with two trim packages. The Exclusive Trim Package includes automated parking, keyless entry, a hands-free power liftgate, wireless phone charging and 64-color ambient lighting. The Pinnacle Trim Package builds on that with a panoramic moonroof, adaptive LED headlights that better illuminate curves, augmented reality navigation, a head-up display, a 10-speaker sound system, 360-degree camera system and puddle lamps.\n\nTuned by Mercedes’ AMG performance division, the AMG GLB35 is fitted with 19-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers and upgraded brakes. It also includes a panoramic moonroof, hands-free power liftgate, front sport seats, keyless entry, a 12-speaker Burmester audio system, wireless phone charging and ambient lighting.\n\nWith its greater complement of standard equipment, the contents of the GLB35’s packages are shuffled. Here, the Exclusive Trim Package includes adaptive headlights, augmented reality navigation and road-sign recognition; and the Pinnacle Trim Package adds a 360-degree system system, head-up display and puddle lamps.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe GLB250’s list of standard safety technologies is rather brief: forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams are the only standard systems. However, the Driver Assistance Package is only $1,700 and includes front and rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed in anticipation of upcoming curves, lane departure steering assist, blind spot intervention and emergency steering assist. The $1,270 Parking Package adds a 360-degree camera system and automated parking.\n\nThe GLB35’s standard equipment is largely the same as the GLB250’s, but it also includes the Parking Package. The Driver Assistance Package adds the same equipment here as it does on the GLB250s.\n\nRead More About the Mercedes-Benz GLB:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLA, GLB: Reworked Styling, Mild-Hybrid Powertrain\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLB35?\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz GLB250\nResearch the Mercedes-AMG GLB35\nFind Your Next Car\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEvery 2026 Mercedes GLB is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s backed by an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In the GLB250 and GLB250 4Matic, the four-cylinder makes 221 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque; the AMG GLB35’s 2.0-liter is tuned to deliver 302 hp and 295 pounds-feet.\n\nOnly the base GLB250 is front-wheel drive; the GLB250 4Matic and AMG GLB35 are AWD. Official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available, but the 2025 FWD GLB250 returns an EPA-estimated 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined, while the GLB250 4Matic is rated at 24/33/27 mpg. The AMG returns 21/26/23 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Contrary to what the badge chasers think, the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is just nice enough to match its name and tripointed star — just don’t expect the materials and mechanical refinement of a more expensive Benz (obviously).\n\nVersus the competition: From a size perspective, the GLB is somewhat in a class of its own; it falls between BMW’s itty-bitty X1 and compact X3 SUVs, nearly matching the latter for manufacturer-reported maximum cargo space. \n\nWhat do you expect from an entry-level luxury vehicle?\n\nOutside a lack of precious materials and gemstones, a $5,500 entry-level Rolex — or Omega or IWC — offers the same level of craftsmanship and attention to detail as a $50,000 example. The same cannot be said of Mercedes-Benz’s lineup, and that’s by design; a GLA250 doesn’t compare to a GLS in materials, design or equipment, but that’s endemic to the auto industry as a whole; you’ll find the same spectrum in many luxury-vehicle lineups.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLA, GLB: Reworked Styling, Mild-Hybrid Powertrain\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nBut I ask again: What do you expect from a base vehicle? How about the second most affordable vehicle in a lineup? The third? What if I said the third-cheapest Benz on the market could be maxed out to around $68,000 and that you might be better off maxing out an equivalently sized vehicle from Toyota, Honda or Chevrolet than scraping your pennies together just for a luxury badge?\n\nDoes This Matter?\n\nI’m screaming into the abyss here. These are not things considered by those who purchase sleds like the $51,000 GLB250 I punted around for a week. As has happened since the dawn of the car, these types of vehicles are purchased explicitly for the badge on the snout, steering wheel and deck lid. It’s a combination of performative peacocking and social grasping that has little to do with value and everything to do with appearances.\n\nSpeaking of appearances, my GLB test car arrived with a very fetching aura I can best describe as rental-spec, with the base wheels and Polar White paint; it looked ready for Hertz’s President’s Circle. This is far, far from a complaint; too often I only get to test the most highly optioned (but less relevant) spec available, so the GLB’s realistic config was refreshing. \n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nContrary to all my yapping earlier, this GLB’s pricing is also realistic, even if my brain is stuck in 2014. According to J.D. Power, the average transaction price of a new car was expected to be nearly $45,000 in October 2024, which is about $2,000 shy of this GLB’s $46,950 starting price (before adding options and all-wheel drive). What’s more, the GLB was not the smallest, slowest or least-equipped car I’ve driven this year. Put it all together, and I’m taking it as a sign to make some serious efforts at cognitive rewiring. \n\nStill, there was nothing particularly luxurious about this GLB’s interior. Materials were mostly on par with what you’d find in the $30,000 price range, save Nappa leather trim for the steering wheel and some neat — if slightly garish — trim peppered with MB’s star motif. There’s also clear design-language continuity with products from the deep end of MB’s lineup. Overall, the GLB’s interior is cool and clean, if a little sterile, with a lovely number of physical controls for climate and volume functions in place of the haptic and touch controls you’ll find on upmarket Mercedes models.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nTech Talk\n\nSpeaking of tech, new for 2024 are a pair of standard 10.25-inch displays that handle driver readout and infotainment functions. A bit small compared with the glossy behemoths found elsewhere in MB’s lineup, they’re fine and dandy here; there’s enough digital real estate to futz with the slightly frustrating MBUX infotainment architecture — and to make full use of the now-standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. I expect screens to grow larger on future generations of the GLB, but the 2024 version’s are absolutely on par with segment standards for now. \n\nLess luxe is the GLB’s powertrain, which consists of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Power is fine, with 221 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque; it returns a fine 0-60 mph time of 6.9 seconds, according to Mercedes; it feels slightly quicker in practice. It’s enough to haul all the folks ‘n flotsam you can cram into its vaguely Gelandewagen-ish proportions — but your passengers might not be entirely comfortable.\n\nThis is not the smoothest powertrain, even with the welcome addition of MB’s 48-volt mild-hybrid system. I have yet to find a dual-clutch transmission that’s well suited for use in a workaday SUV, and the GLB’s moderately herky-jerky eight-speed transmission isn’t changing my mind. It wasn’t just the occasional gruff downshift, either; I  occasionally caught the transmission unawares and experienced a notable delay during outlier moments of aggressive acceleration, like when turning left in front of oncoming traffic. The GLB sometimes paused a bit too long for comfort before lurching forward.\n\nCargo King\n\nThose are all the complaints I have from a dynamic perspective. The GLB’s ride is mostly cushy and befitting of the badge, and highway cruising is requisitely soporific thanks to the GLB’s wombo combo of refined ride, a quiet interior and optional adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go for turgid traffic.\n\nI used the GLB to haul not a single thing beyond lil’ ‘ol me, but the cabin is notably cavernous for the segment; its boxy-ish profile and tweener size pay dividends for both headroom and cargo capacity. Its manufacturer-reported 62 cubic feet of maximum storage space with the rear seats folded flat bests the BMW X1’s 57.2 cubes and isn’t far behind the segment-up BMW X3’s 67.1 cubic feet of maximum space. I wouldn’t suggest it for anything more than short trips, but a two-person third row is available as an $850 option on the GLB; it’s the only configuration of its kind in either the segment below it or above it in its class.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nOverall, the GLB250 is a mostly comfortable and premium compact-ish SUV that feels just “Mercedes” enough for the tripointed star. I shan’t condone purchasing one purely for the badge, but if you’ve got the budget and need for something premium — and you live in a tight, urban environment — I can’t fault the refreshed 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 beyond wanting a traditional automatic transmission. Just make sure to set your expectations accordingly, and please — if you’re going to get it in white, at least add a nice set of wheels.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nMercedes-Benz Teases Electric Next-Gen CLA-Class Due Next Year\n2024 Mercedes-AMG CLA35 Review: Small and Spendy\nMercedes-Benz GLC350e PHEV Starts at $61,050, Gets 54-Mile Electric Range\nResearch the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250\nShop for a 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLB?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is a slightly boxier and more practical offshoot of the automaker’s GLA subcompact SUV. A 221-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a choice of front- or 4Matic all-wheel drive. This powertrain delivers a nice combination of peppy performance and reasonable fuel economy. If speed is what you’re after, the 302-hp turbo four in the AMG GLB35 delivers the goods, but it’s significantly pricier. The available third row is a definite bonus in the GLB, but keep in mind its dimensions are so cozy, it’s only suitable for kids. If you like the GLB but want an EV, the all-electric Mercedes-EQ EQB is built on the basic platform of the GLB.    \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLB?\n\nMercedes-Benz has made no significant changes to the GLB lineup for the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLB Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nPower-adjustable front seats\nPower liftgate\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nDual-zone climate control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit alert\nBlind spot warning system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nThird-row seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n10.25-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\n12-speaker Burmester audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nSurround-view parking camera\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLB?\n\nThe GLB makes a safe play amid the increasingly crowded field of small luxury SUVs. The standard 221-hp turbo four offers strong acceleration, but the steering lacks the feedback you’ll find in some more nimble rivals. Perhaps the GLB’s biggest advantages are its available third row of seating and roomy cargo area. While those aren’t exactly the wildest or most romantic reasons for choosing a Mercedes-Benz SUV, they are valuable assets that help the GLB stand out in a long roster of tough competition.",
