      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe Mercedes-EQ EQE is a five-seat, luxury all-electric vehicle that can be had as a slinky sedan or a more upright SUV; both are essentially smaller, less expensive versions of the Mercedes-EQ EQS Sedan and SUV. Range and performance depend largely on which drivetrain an EQE buyer chooses. Serving duty in EQE350 trims is a single electric motor that sends 288 horsepower to the rear wheels. Dual-motor all-wheel drive is available on EQE350 trims, but output with AWD stands pat at 288 hp. The EQE500 and high-performance AMG EQE trims come standard with a dual-motor AWD powertrain; the EQE500 has 402 hp, while the AMG EQE has 617 hp in standard form or 677 hp with an optional AMG Dynamic Plus Package. \n\nThe EQE Sedan’s rivals include the Audi E-Tron GT, Genesis Electrified G80, Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S. The EQE SUV competes with the Audi Q8 e-Tron, BMW iX, Cadillac Lyriq, Genesis Electrified GV70 and GV60, Porsche Macan EV and Tesla Model X.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe EQE range debuted for 2023, but Mercedes has made a few improvements and additions for 2024. New battery tech is said to give a modest boost to range, and a heat pump is now standard for better efficiency in cold weather. The regenerative braking system gets updated software for a more natural pedal feel. The AMG EQE was offered only as a sedan for 2023, but an SUV version joins the line this year.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE Have?\n\nThe EQE’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 230 to 307 miles, depending on body style, trim level and drive wheels.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Charge the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nAccording to Mercedes, the EQE’s battery can be charged from 10% to 100% in approximately 10 hours when using a 240-volt Level 2 charger. A DC fast charger requires around 32 minutes to recharge the battery from 10% to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPanoramic sunroof\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n15-speaker Burmester audio system\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n56-inch Hyperscreen full-width dashboard display\nLeather upholstery\nHead-up instrument display\nFour-zone climate control\nInterior air filtration and fragrance system\nHeated windshield wipers\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nAir suspension\nRear-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe Mercedes-EQ EQE is a technological tour de force in either of its two available body styles, and it boasts posher trimmings than many of its EV rivals. Range isn’t class-leading, but it is competitive — unless a buyer prefers the high-performance, electron-gobbling AMG version. Cabin quality is generally excellent, though the onboard tech requires lots of patience to master. A small rear window in the sedan limits outward visibility, and the rear seat bottom cushions are high and hinder rear headroom. Of the two, the roomier SUV model is the more practical (if slightly pricier) choice.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: All of the bigger EQS Sedan’s novelty, controversial styling and stunning abilities, but in a shorter, less-expensive package.\n\nVersus the competition: The EQE is far more opulent, luxurious and sophisticated than anything Tesla makes, but doesn’t have the efficiency, speed or athletic prowess of the Model 3 or Model S.\n\nThe whole idea of “one sausage, three sizes” was borne out of German luxury-car strategy in decades past. The general practice was that you create one design and simply scale it larger and smaller to fit the three main size categories: full-size, mid-size and compact. Over the years, German automakers started straying from that, proliferating models and variants that blended the lines between segments, but it seems that with the introduction of Mercedes-Benz’s line of electric cars marketed under the Mercedes-EQ banner, that strategy is making a comeback. Witness this, the new 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE. It’s the fully electric E-Class equivalent of the fully electric S-Class equivalent the company sells as the EQS Sedan. But is it really just an EQS-lite? Shorter, narrower and less expensive? Yes, actually it is.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQS Review: Ze Germans Embrace ze Future\n\nI’ve Seen You Somewhere Before\n\nThe overall shape of the EQE is nearly identical to the larger EQS Sedan. The EQE simply looks like a seven-eighths-scale EQS Sedan, from the overarching bow line, which extends from the front wheels, up over the roof and down to the short trunk, to the cab-forward design aesthetic that pushes the wheels out to the corners to create more cabin space. The look is almost certainly necessitated by the aerodynamics of the car — the EQS Sedan was already super slippery, and so is the smaller EQE. It needs to be aerodynamically efficient to help extend the car’s range, as drag can sap battery power at higher speeds. So it looks like it does because it has to — whether or not that’s a good look depends on your opinion of the car’s design. But one benefit of the “one sausage, many sizes” idea is that if you like the look of one model in the lineup, you’re likely going to like the look of the rest of them. Unfortunately, the opposite also holds true for people who are not fans of the look.\n\nWhile the shape might be great for aerodynamics, it’s not doing anything good for interior layout, outward visibility and cabin space. The same foibles in design and packaging that made the EQS an imperfect offering have reappeared here in the smaller EQE. The first has to do with dashboard design — sitting in the EQE, you’re faced with an absolute cliff of a dashboard, especially if you’ve opted for a model with the 56-inch Hyperscreen that stretches a piece of glass from edge to edge, covering three separate panels. My test car had the smaller 12.8-inch OLED portrait-oriented touchscreen, which is less imposing but just as tricky to navigate at a glance. For people expecting to sit down and operate everything intuitively, well, that’s just not going to happen; using a modern Mercedes-Benz has a learning curve associated with it and will take many exposures before it becomes easy or routine.\n\nBut the more fundamental issue with the EQE’s dash is more about the placement of the digital instrument cluster. It’s placed so high on the dashboard that I have to place the steering wheel in an unnaturally high position to be able to actually read the gauges, leading me to drive in an arms-up position like I’m behind the monkey-style handlebars of some custom chopper motorcycle. And even then, the position is not high enough for the EQE’s satisfaction, as it keeps telling me I need to raise the steering wheel even more so its cameras can view my face for the attention assist and semi-autonomous driving monitors. Raising the seat bottom doesn’t solve this issue, as headroom is in short supply in the EQE due to the panoramic moonroof’s track.\n\nThis swoopy design also affects rearward visibility, as the back window in the EQE is a gunslit of an opening. Seeing anything behind the vehicle on the road is a challenge, as you’re only getting the lower half of anything behind you in your rearview mirror. Forward visibility is also compromised by the super-tall dash, but side visibility isn’t too bad.\n\nSeat comfort is good, with a lot of adjustability baked into the front chairs. Rear seat comfort, however, is again compromised by the low roofline. Legroom is adequate, but the backseat bottom cushions are rather high because of the battery packaging, putting passengers’ heads hard up against the headliner. Getting in and out of the backseat is also a bit of a contortion act, as you’ll need to duck down to get around that plunging roofline as well. Suffice it to say, the overall cabin packaging shows compromises were made, ones that simply do not appear in a lot of competitor vehicles.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nFamiliar On The Road, Too\n\nSo it has the same interior foibles as the bigger EQS, but does it drive like its bigger brother as well? Yes, it really does. There are three trims available: the 350 Plus with a single motor on the rear axle; the 350 4Matic, which features a motor on each front and rear axle and thus has all-wheel drive; and the 500 4Matic, which amps up the power and torque from the 350 dual-motor version. My test car was the 350 4Matic, making 288 horsepower and 564 pounds-feet of torque. And just like the bigger EQS, the beauty of this powertrain is that it’s adjustable to suit your mood and needs: calm and composed for around-town, everyday driving or flat-out mental if you’re looking for speed and excitement. The use of standard rear-wheel steering, which can angle the rear wheels up to 10 degrees, makes this an astonishingly agile car as well, just like the bigger EQS. The EQE just winds its way through tight urban confines and twisty mountain roads with ease and comfort. It’s a remarkably well-done bit of technology and truly adds to the unique experience of driving the EQE.\n\nThe car’s steering feel is more on the neutral and numb side, however, but that’s okay because this isn’t meant to be a sports sedan, given its prodigious weight. It’s more at home being a competent luxury cruiser, soaking up bumps and gliding down smooth asphalt in near silence, without any drone from the tires or motors, or even a whoosh from the wind slipping past the windows. Elegance and poise is more the order of the day than alacrity and noise. You won’t be disappointed if you drive it like a luxury car rather than a sports sedan. Only the brakes disappoint, which share the same dead, uncommunicative pedal feel as the EQS. The brakes seem to develop a mind of their own if you’ve chosen a more aggressive energy recuperation setting, like the bigger EQS. When you lift off the accelerator, they actually actuate the pedal themselves, meaning the brake pedal isn’t always in the position that you think it is. That is still just as massively disconcerting in the EQE as it is in the EQS and is the big reason I don’t like the “one-pedal driving” style Mercedes-Benz offers up in these models.\n\nComing Soon: Pricing, Range\n\nWe’re still short of a few details on the EQE, despite it heading for U.S. showrooms in the next few months. We don’t yet have any estimates for the range of the EQE and its 90.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, but Mercedes reports it can go 410 miles on a charge in the European cycle, though the U.S. cycle is likely to be considerably less because the EPA’s testing methodology differs from the European format. It is a pretty big battery pack, however, so numbers approaching 300 miles are not out of the question. We also don’t have any pricing for the car yet, but given it’s meant to compete against things like the Tesla Model S and Lucid Air, you can pretty well imagine it’s likely to start in the $70,000-$80,000 range.\n\nThe EQE should provide an interesting competitor for those models and might indeed appeal to someone who’s tired of looking at the Model S in their driveway, which hasn’t changed much visually since it was introduced a decade ago. The EQE isn’t nearly as athletic as that Model S, nor does its interior packaging seem as well sorted out, but it does offer far more luxurious trimmings, some nifty and useful technology, and a fresh face to show the valets at your favorite restaurants and clubs. The novelty alone should gain it some fans, but in all honesty, we’re really more looking forward to the SUV version of this vehicle that’s promised for next year, which we hope will help resolve some of the packaging issues that seem to affect the EQ lineup of sedans.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Mercedes EQS: Think of It as an Electric S-Class\nAll-Electric 2022 Mercedes-EQ EQS Sedan Starts at $103,360\n2022 Mercedes-EQ EQB: The GLB Goes Electric\n2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE: Like the EQS, in a Smaller Package\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has committed to electrification in a big way, currently offering five different electric vehicles (six, if you count the Maybach version of the EQS SUV separately, which we’re not). Right in the middle of that broad lineup sits the EQE Sedan, which debuted for the 2023 model year alongside the similarly mid-sized EQE SUV. For 2025, the EQE Sedan gets a new battery pack and interior enhancements.\n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE Review: Smaller Size, Same Issues\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQE Sedan is on sale now. Full line pricing, including the $1,150 destination fee, is as follows:\n\n350+: $76,050\n350 4Matic: $79,050\n500 4Matic: $87,050\nAMG EQE: $108,050\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Mercedes-EQ EQE Sedan?\n\nThe 2025 EQE Sedan’s hard-hitting news is a new battery pack with a 96-kilowatt-hour capacity. But the bigger pack is only installed in the EQE350+ and EQE500 4Matic; the 350 4Matic and AMG EQE soldier on with a 90.6-kWh pack. The all-electric sedan also sees updated regenerative braking software.\n\nFrom there, developments for the EQE Sedan get a little softer, as in literally soft: The optional multicontour front seats gain head-restraint pillows, and the available leather upholstery now includes throw pillows for the rear passengers (although we suppose you could throw them anywhere). Soft-close doors that prevent slamming and latch themselves are also now available.\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nThe 2025 EQE Sedan is available with four different powertrains. At the bottom of the pyramid is the EQE350+, which has a single electric motor driving the rear wheels with 288 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. EPA-rated range for the 350+ is 308 miles. The EQE350 4Matic adds a motor on the front axle for all-wheel drive; total horsepower is unchanged at 288, but torque jumps to 564 pounds-feet. The 350 4Matic is good for 267 miles on a charge.\n\nNot so long ago, a Mercedes with a “500” badge would have packed a burly V-8 engine under the hood. In the EQE500 4Matic, though, that number denotes two electric motors with a combined 402 hp (a figure past Mercedes powertrain engineers would have been thrilled to coax from a normally aspirated V-8) and 633 pounds-feet (twist they only could have realized with turbochargers). The larger battery helps the higher-output 4Matic reach nearly as far as the 350, with an EPA-rated range of 266 miles.\n\nThose who take their ecologically conscious luxury with a frothy flagon of punch will find the AMG EQE Sedan appealing. Here, two motors produce a nominal 617 hp and 701 pounds-feet of torque combined, but they can squeeze out 677 hp and 738 pounds-feet for brief spurts that allow it to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.2 seconds, per Mercedes. (That betters the EQE500 by 1.3 seconds and the 350 4Matic and 350+ by 2.8 and 3 seconds, respectively.) The trade-off for all that power, however, is needing to find a plug every 220 miles.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety technology on the EQE Sedan includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, a driver attention monitor, automatic high beams, a 360-degree parking camera and automated parking.\n\nThe EQE350+ rides on 20-inch wheels and features LED head- and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, and keyless entry and start. It is upholstered in synthetic leather and has power-adjustable heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. The standard tech suite includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, a 15-speaker Burmester surround sound system, and a 12.8-inch touchscreen with navigation, voice control, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The EQE350 4Matic doesn’t add any standard features beyond the powertrain upgrades.\n\nThe EQE500 4Matic includes Mercedes-Benz’s new Hyperscreen digital dashboard, which spans from A-pillar to A-pillar with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, 17.7-inch central touchscreen and another 12.3-inch touchscreen for the passenger, all beneath a single piece of glass.\n\nAt the top of the lineup, the AMG EQE Sedan rides on an adaptive air suspension with rear-wheel steering and features performance-tuned AWD logic and upgraded brakes. Its safety suite gains adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, automated lane changes, emergency stop assist and road-sign recognition. The AMG also includes upgraded exterior lighting, augmented-reality navigation and a heated steering wheel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE500 a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nDriving 3 EVs in Zero-Degree Temps: What Could Go Wrong?\nResearch Mercedes-Benz\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
