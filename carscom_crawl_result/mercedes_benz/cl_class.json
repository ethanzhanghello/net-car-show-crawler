      "expert_review": "When one sees a Mercedes-Benz, one is tempted to think of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s ‘All The Sad Young Men’ where he writes that the very rich ‘…are different from you and me.’\n\nAllow me to lift the veil on what the very wealthy experience when they go out motoring in the truly gorgeous 2000 Mercedes-Benz CL 500 Coupe.\n\nLarge luxury coupes are a vanishing breed. Cadillac’s Eldorado and Lexus’s SC300/400 haven’t exactly enjoyed robust sales. Lincoln’s Mark VIII has vanished. But most of those vehicles compete in a realm that’s half the price of this vehicle.\n\nThe CL 500 competes in a rarefied strata where the air and lines of customers are thinner. (American marques sadly no longer compete this high in the market, a real change from 60 years ago.)\n\nWhen venturing this high, lots of power is a given. Therefore, the CL 500 gets a silky smooth 5-liter V-8 with 302 horsepower and 339 foot-pounds of torque. Once again, Fitzgerald is called to mind as the engine’s note rises with speed and power. ‘Her voice is full of money,’ Fitzgerald wrote in the ‘Great Gatsby.’\n\nAll this power is dispatched to the rear wheels with the authority of a Fortune 500 CEO through a five-speed automatic transmission, which can be shifted manually. The transmission is seamless, so there’s no need to be bothered shifting.\n\nOf course, this big Benz has Active Body Control. Sensors placed throughout the car activate hydraulics at each wheel to keep the car flat in corners while delivering the velvet ride that just oozes with sophistication. It is never soft, yet it is soft enough not jar the sensibilities of the monetarily endowed.\n\nStyling is masterful, with a blend of modernity and classic character cues that make this car an instant classic. From its round headlamps to the gentle, classic curve of its roof, the coupe seemed perfectly coiffed for its class. It hits all the right emotions.\n\nThe interior matched the stylish exterior. Two large bucket seats hold the driver and a passenger firmly in place. Swathed in a sumptuous perforated leather, the seats truly pamper their occupants. The side bolsters are electrically adjustable for width, helpful for expanding waistlines. The seats also are heated and cooled. After all, one can’t arrive at the club looking good if the seats aren’t ventilated.\n\nIf you sentence people to sit in the somewhat roomy rear seat, stylish chrome handles electrically activate the FRONT OR BACK ? seat to move forward. One quickly realizes why Mercedes Benz also makes sedans. A power-activated rear-window sunshade blocks the sun from baking backseat drivers.\n\nThe interior has lots of the expected luxury goodies to keep hedonists occupied. Dual-zone climate control keeps everyone comfy. A voice activated cell-phone keeps you in touch with your office, accountant or lawyer. A handset allows you to carry this phone with you, a thoughtful touch. TeleAid is an automatic calling system to keep you in touch in case trouble strik es. A Global-Positioning-System tells you where you are and a 10-speaker Bose audio system with sub-woofer keeps you amused.\n\nSafety has always been a Mercedes-Benz strong point, and on that account this car lacks nothing. The Xenon headlamps automatically adjust for level and they cast a strong, clear light.\n\nAir bags are included on the front and sides, as well as at head-level. Anti-lock disc brakes are standard, as is electronic stability control and automatic slip control. Both systems help prevent the car from sliding into a ditch.\n\nSo what is to fault with the CL 500? Only that so few will drive so grand an automobile. Its effortless acceleration, graceful styling and indulgent features make this a car with which every driver would want to become acquainted.\n\nTo the wealthy it is merely a desirable appliance, a bauble, a small reward for long hours at the office.\n\nWas F. Scott Fitzgerald right? Are the rich different? Ernest Hemingway supplied th e answer in his ory ‘The Snows of Kilimanjaro.’ ‘Yes, they have more money.’\n\n>> 2000 Mercedes-Benz CL 500\n\nEngine: 5-liter double-overhead cam, all-aluminum 24-valve V-8\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic with selectable manual control\nTires: 225/75 ZR-17\nWheelbase: 113.6 inches\nLength: 196.6 inches\nCurb weight: 4,115 pounds\nTrunk volume: 12.3 cubic feet\nBase price: $85,500\nAs tested: $89,695\nEPA rating: 18 mpg city, 23 mpg highwaybr> Test mileage: 18 mpg\nFuel type: Premium\n>>",

      "expert_review": "When a luxury car’s options alone add up to more than the price of a basic vehicle, such as a Chevrolet Aveo, you know you’re cruising in the automotive ether.\n\nThat’s the case with today’s test car. For 13 large, it can be outfitted with extras that include special paint, special leathers, an elegant headliner, a “dynamic rearview mirror” (be still my heart), fancy woods, and special wheels.\n\nFor most of us, such a car is far out of reach, but sometimes it’s tempting to fantasize and go along for the ride. We are behind the wheel of the 2007 Mercedes-Benz CL550, the relative “baby” in a line of CLs. Essentially, they are top-of-the-line S-Series cars turned coupe, but far more fun.\n\nWith a 5.5-liter V-8, it tops out at “just” 382 horsepower and 391 lb.-ft. of torque for tugging.\n\nIt has a top speed of 130 miles per hour, but only because it is electronically limited to not go any faster. It will also go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in well under 5 seconds. Not that we advise anyone to go that fast or to accelerate that quickly.\n\nStill, this is the baby of the 2007/2008 CL models because its performance is easily outclassed by the CL63 (518-horsepower V-8), and the CL65 AMG, at 604 horsepower with twin-turbo aspiration.\n\nBut not that long ago, the CL550 would have been a competitor on some of America’s toughest race tracks (assuming the electronic limits on speed were lifted). It is an incredibly stiff yet lithe automobile. If the weight – nearly 2 1/2 tons – could be chopped, this would be a world-class sports car. I don’t know why it needs to be so heavy, but what do you want for $115,000?\n\nWhen we review a car, we always ask there questions: At whom is it aimed, and will they be happy?\n\nThe easy guess here is that it will appeal to folks who have plenty of money and an eye for bling and bang, but are not so concerned about ultimate performance. For true enthusiasts, that’s a bit of a shame, because this car does boast lots of bang beyond the bling.\n\nOther than its weighty feel when being tossed into corners, the car is remarkably firm and stable. There is the sense of heft when going down an entrance ramp, but once it’s on the highway, the straight-ahead push is powerful and tactile. The steering response is pleasingly delicate, braking is “bar the gates” sudden, and acceleration, as needed, makes it feel like a plane.\n\nThere is no skimping on luxury (and there shouldn’t be, given the price). Taut leathers, a crisp four-passenger seating set-up with quad-bolstering, and a sound system to die for are standard. So are safety features such as electronic stability and head-protection air bags. Overall, there are nine air bags, including front knee protection.\n\nStandard comfort features include Sirius satellite radio, leather, navigation, 14-way adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, hands-free communication, heated front seats, and a guy who lives in the trunk and parks the car when you stop (just kidding).\n\nNot many of us can afford this car – which is available in “upscale” versions that reach nearly $150,000. But it sure is fun to drive.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "I used to chuckle at Mercedes-Benz drivers. To me, the sight of the cars either meant a rolling midlife crisis or something comparable to a weekend duffer bringing a $6,000 set of clubs to the public golf course. I mean, do you reallllllly need all that?\n\nNow, after having driven a string of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, I’ve become one of those motorists I used to laugh at. It must be some kind of Mercedes virus — either that, or prolonged exposure to the automaker’s luxury loaded cars prompts a bizarre addiction to the point where you find yourself saying things like, “What, no navigation system in this one? How gauche!”\n\nAt any rate, those who long for Mercedes’ storied engineering happily have many choices — from the merely pricey to the obscenely expensive. Here’s a look at the models I have sampled from the Mercedes lot:\n\n2001 C240 sedan\n\nIt’s a cute little five-passenger model from the C-Class. Oh, and it’s a steal in Mercedes terms with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $29,950.\n\nOh, sure, it has a comparatively humble 2.6-liter V-6 (168 horsepower), but it’s loaded with enough standard goodies to put your American-luxury-car-owning neighbors to shame. Leather seating inserts, wood interior trim, auto-dimming mirrors, stop-on-a-dime four-wheel disc brakes and front/rear crumple zones are just a few of the perks.\n\nThe V-6, by the way, more than handles what the local roadways dish out (sequential multipoint fuel injection helps, of course), and the C240 can be dressed up with various four-figure options to make it a more-worthy road warrior.\n\nEven with the base $29,950 version, you still get top-drawer M-B engineering, and the technicians at the elegant Mercedes-Benz service centers give you the same attention as those drivers bringing in six-figure-priced machines.\n\nPeople prowling for an entry-level Mercedes will have more to cheer about soon as the C-Class Coupe reaches American shores in numbers. That will be a bargain-basement offering among Mercedes vehicles, starting around $26,000.\n\n2001 S55 AMG sedan\n\nTo be precise, it’s a five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase (121.5 inches). But it’s a light year removed from the C240, with the “AMG” designation being the tip-off. AMG is M-B’s high-performance division, and in the S55, that translates to a 5.5-liter V-8 laying down 354 horsepower and 391 pounds/foot of torque (at only 3,000 revolutions per minute).\n\nThe standard package also includes an active suspension, ultra-fancy 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker premium Bose sound system with CD changer, 14-way power-adjustable front seats and a power telescoping steering wheel.\n\nAnd there’s the pleasure of watching a sports-car-driving wacko disappear in your rearview mirrors when you apply the power to your classy looking family sedan.\n\nPlease note, this kind of S-Class pleasure c osts $99,645 on the bottom line. That’s with zero options, a $645 destination/delivery charge and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\n2001 S600 sedan\n\nStill trying to digest that sticker price on the S55? What’s the big deal?\n\nHere’s another S-Class five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase, but with a 362 horsepower V-12 and a navigation system, the sticker price jumps to $115,945.\n\nPutting a right foot deep into an accelerator hooked up to a V-12 is an experience every motorist should experience at least once. It almost makes the drawbacks worth it. Those would be fear of parking within 10 feet of other vehicles, insurance bill terror and an overwhelming urge to rush outside every five minutes to see if anyone has put a ding in your car.\n\nOne other thing: The car has so much on it that it will take you at least three months to master every tech goodie explained in the owner’s manual.\n\n2002 SL500 coupe\n\nHere we g Much more reasonable. This SL-Class coupe/roadster carries two passengers and starts at only $83,800.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. This is a rich person’s toy. You’re 100 percent correct, and what a toy it is! Nothing stirs the automotive journalist’s soul like having momentary possession of a vehicle utterly beyond the reach of his income.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to pay the fare, the SL500 package includes a 302-horsepower V-8, independent damper struts on the front, rain-sensitive windshield wipers, headlight washer/wipers and a security system that does everything but write up an arrest report on the prospective offender.\n\nThrow in an extra $2,500 for a “Silver Arrow Edition” option, and you get amenities such as a bulletproof silver paint job, a six-CD changer and six-spoke wheels so dazzling that sunglasses are mandatory equipment for viewing.\n\n2001 CL600 coupe\n\nThis is the ultimate in the Mercedes-Benz test-model lot. The mother lode. The Holy Grail.\n\nThe four-passenger coupe with a 362 horsepower V-12, the full range of techno goodies and a 600-pages-plus owner’s manual that only those with advanced degrees in automotive engineering will fully understand starts at $117,200.\n\nMy test model was dressed up with perks that included a tire pressure-monitoring system, an electronic trunk closer, “Distronic” adaptive cruise control (which automatically adjusts for distance between vehicles while in cruise control) and AMG-added enhancements that brought the bottom line to $127,895.\n\nTo be honest, the entire time I had this test model I lived in fear of runaway shopping carts and no-look lane changers. Motorists with more money and bravery than I should know that this coupe represents just about the highest level of current automotive evolution.\n\n2001 CLK320 cabriolet\n\nAh, a nice way to finish our tour — a delightful four-passenger droptop with a comparatively easy-to-take MSRP of $48,900.\n\nGetting those two passengers into the back of the CLK320 might be a neat trick, but virtually everything else on this joy ride pleases. Handling for a low-range-priced Mercedes was outstanding. The softtop with a 215 horsepower V-6 held high-speed turns better than the new-for-2002 Lexus SC 430, which starts at $58,455.\n\nGolden State motorists who like to take that dream Big Sur coastal drive on Highway 1 south of Monterey take note: This might be the best car out there for that trip.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOther than some new colors, not much is new in 2002 for the CL-Class coupe, which is essentially a two-door equivalent of the ultra-luxury S-Class sedan. Mercedes-Benz launched the CL500 for the 2000 model year, and the CL600 with V-12 power and a performance-oriented CL55 AMG soon followed.\n\nDistronic Adaptive Cruise Control is optional. This radar-based system adjusts the cars speed automatically to maintain a preset distance behind the vehicle ahead. A Keyless Go option has also been added, and Mercedes Tele Aid telematics system offers an expanded selection of concierge-type services.\n\nExterior\nStyling themes for these two-door models echo the appearance of the four-door S-Class sedan, and the automaker says the CL-Class recalls the glorious Mercedes coupes of the past. Flowing fenders, four oval headlights, a smaller sloped grille that displays the Mercedes three-pointed star emblem, and a wraparound back window help give the CL-Class a personality all of its own. The CL55 AMG has aerodynamic body trim, a firmer-than-usual suspension and 18-inch tires.\n\nMeasuring 196.6 inches long overall, the CL-Class coupe has a 113.6-inch wheelbase and is 73.1 inches wide. All CL coupes have Active Body Control  an active suspension system with electronic controls that continuously adjust suspension firmness. The system is intended to eliminate body roll and pitch during cornering, acceleration and braking.\n\nInterior\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz sedans that seat five occupants, the two-door CL-Class coupes are built for four passengers by using two bucketlike rear seats. The CL600 has unique Nappa leather upholstery and either burl walnut or chestnut interior trim.\n\nA standard satellite-based navigation system has a touchscreen integrated into the dashboard. An SOS button is available for automatic emergency calling and is tied to the Tele Aid system, which also offers such services as travel reservations and sports/entertainment ticket purchases. Voice-activation operates the Bose audio system. An InfoServices option can deliver customized news headlines, stock quotes, sports scores, weather forecasts and other services via a wireless Internet connection.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are still available. A 302-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 goes into the CL500 and works with a five-speed Touch Shift automatic transmission that permits clutchless, manually selected gear changes when desired. Mercedes claims that the CL500 accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds. The CL600 employs a 5.8-liter V-12 that generates 362 hp. And a 355-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 powers the potent CL55 AMG, which Mercedes bills as the performance showcase.\n\nSafety\nDoor-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, curtain-type airbags that deploy from above the side windows to protect occupants heads and rear side-impact airbags that protect the torsos of backseat occupants are standard. The front passengers airbag deploys at one of two levels, depending on the degree of impact. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Too Rich? Too Fast? Never.\n2004 Mercedes-Benz CL600 V-12\n\nRAGGED POINT, Calif.\n\nWe tried to avoid tourist traps. But we needed gasoline, food and restrooms — all of which are in short supply on the 80-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 1 that skirts the Big Sur coast.\n\nSo we pulled into this place, a commercial patch amid mystic beauty, and parked the silver 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL600 V-12 coupe.\n\nTania Anderson, my driving partner, noticed it first: Tourists exiting buses detoured before going to restrooms or fast-food stands. They first stopped to ogle the CL600.\n\n“Hot car!” said Tania, a private-jet flight attendant, frequent movie extra and bona fide car nut. “They’d rather look at that car than [heed nature’s call].”\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “It’s different.” It was an understatement born more of embarrassment than insight.\n\nThe difference, in this case, came in the form of a 5.5-liter, 493-horsepower V-12 engine capable of moving the CL600 from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. At least, that’s what the engineers at Mercedes-Benz claimed. We didn’t try to clock that speed ourselves.\n\nYou can do many things on Highway 1, things wonderfully memorable and astoundingly dumb. One of the dumbest things you can do is to speed around the curves of the highway’s numerous rail-free cliffs, which afford little room for error.\n\nWe wanted to see the scenery, not become a part of it. We drove here southbound from Monterey, stopping often to photograph the region’s brilliant displays of nature. Occasionally we’d find a bit of straight, uncluttered road and let the CL600 run, which it did effortlessly.\n\nThere was no macho exhaust note, no grunt-and-launch acceleration. There was nothing except speed, delivered so smoothly it was frightening.\n\n“You’re at 90!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Ninety!” shouted Tania. “Look at the speedometer!”\n\nI slowed down. But I got a chance to shout the same thing at her when she got behind the wheel, which gave me no small amount of satisfaction.\n\nAt one point we activated the CL600’s optional Distronic Adaptive Cruise Control system, which is a super-smart cruise control similar to the one used in the 2004 Cadillac XLR roadster.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s Distronic uses a radar-based sensor to maintain a preset distance between you and the car or truck ahead of you. It automatically varies the car’s throttle opening and applies partial braking force (up to 20 percent of maximum braking power) to maintain the preset driving distance.\n\nNeither of us liked the Distronic feature. It worked perfectly. But “it’s too perfect,” said Tania. “It’s like somebody taking over the car and driving it for you.” I agreed and turned Distronic off.\n\nAt one point, we got into a debate over the wisdom and ethics of building a car so powerful, so luxurious — outfitted with full Napa leather upholstery, hand- polished chestnut wood trim, and every conceivable convenience and entertainment item.\n\nBut that debate ended when we pulled into this place, which is really quite beautiful despite its commercial kitsch.\n\nAll those people who paused to look at the CL600 after getting off those buses answered the question for us.\n\n“I don’t care what anyone says, people are attracted to wealth,” Tania said. And I said “Amen” to that.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: Mercedes-Benz has been rapped lately for quality problems. After driving the CL600 and several of the company’s other top-line cars, I think I know why. Mercedes-Benz has gone “plug-in” crazy, snatching up every electronic gizmo it can find and installing them in its cars without being certain that the things will work, or that buyers will easily understand them. The onboard navigation system remains a case in point — still too complicated, too clumsy. You’ve got to turn on the radio to make it wo k.\n\nPraise: A beautiful piece of machinery. Extremely well engineered, well balanced. An absolute joy to drive — with the navigation system off.\n\nHead-turning quotient: High. “People are attracted to wealth.”\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Superior in every respect.\n\nLayout/body style: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door, four-passenger coupe with no center pillar.\n\nEngine/transmission: The CL600 is equipped with a 5.5-liter V-12 engine that develops 493 horsepower at 5,000 revolutions per minute and 590 foot-pounds of torque between 1,800 and 3,500 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission that can also be operated manually.\n\nMileage: We averaged 15 miles per gallon in mostly high-altitude highway driving. Premium unleaded fuel is required.\n\nSafety: Curtain air bags, traction and stability control systems, Distronic cruise control, electronic brake assistance — in short, all of the safety that big bucks can buy in a car.\n\nPrice: The price has not been publicly announced at this writing. But Mercedes-Benz sources said the CL600 probably will have a base price of, gulp, $126,000.\n\nPurse-strings note: If you have the money, go for it.",

      "expert_review": "I don’t know many personally, but I must presume there are people for whom $4-a-gallon gasoline is a minor annoyance, causing only a momentary pause as the gas pump’s digits rocket by so fast that before you know it, you’re talking real money. For other people, at least.\n\nThose must be the customers for the 2008 Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG, a marvelous coupe that, should you need to, can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, en route to a top speed of 186 mph, all the while giving you a seat massage. With an EPA mileage rating of 11 miles per gallon city, 18 mpg highway, that massage could help ease the pain in the wallet pocket.\n\nThe CL63 AMG is, as the name suggests, a product of Mercedes’ in-house hot rod shop, AMG, which used to be separate from, but affiliated with, the company, until the company bought the tuning shop and brought it in-house. Mercedes has long had few peers in the luxury department, but AMG’s influence these past five years or so has made Mercedes-Benz arguably the leader in performance luxury, a title once held without dispute by BMW. Mercedes performance cars once had a moderately numb, impersonal feel: no longer.\n\nAnd fortunately, AMG models cater to those among us (well, among you, maybe — not many journalists own one) who can afford to buy the best and then afford to feed it. It should go without saying that the CL63 AMG requires premium gas — I assume that the nozzle from a pump for regular gas would fit, but I suspect it would hurt the feelings of the Mercedes to the point that it would act like Big Brown at Belmont — the driver might say in the home stretch, “I’ve run out of horsepower!”\n\nPerhaps the most startling aspect of the 6.3-liter, 518-horsepower V-8 is that it isn’t even the largest, most powerful engine offered in the CL: That would be the CL65, with a 6.0-liter turbocharged 12-cylinder engine with 604 horsepower. I wonder: Do CL65 owners pity those who can only afford a CL63? Our car’s base price is $137,500, while the CL65 starts at $197,500.\n\nThe test car had options, though, ranging from upgraded tires and wheels to a “dynamic rear view monitor” that, along with a $2,600 federal “gas guzzler” tax, upped the list price to $152,885.\n\nInside, it does not get much better than this: Wonderful, supple leather-covered, heated and cooled seats, a stellar sound system, lovely hand-polished burl walnut trim, and about every safety feature you can conceive of. On the road, the CL63’s ride is firm but smooth; handling is exceptional. Acceleration, thanks to the big V-8 and an eager seven-speed automatic transmission, is exceptional, but the car is so quiet that only the pleasant burble of the exhaust tells how fast you’re going.\n\nThis is, of course, a wonderful car: At more than $150,000, there would be no excuse if it wasn’t. And as irrelevant a car such as this may seem to those of us in the working class, it’s nice that there’s still a place for a car of such quality. How much longer there will be customers for it, though, is the question probably some Mercedes-Benz executives are asking.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com, or through his blog at OrlandoSentinel.com/gasgauge.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benz is notorious for introducing high-performance AMG editions of its passenger cars, and the CL-Class is no exception. A supercharged V-8 became available in the CL55 AMG for 2003. Mercedes-Benz added an even hotter CL65 AMG with a 604-horsepower twin-turbo V-12 for the 2005 model year.\n\nEquipped with Active Body Control and special AMG spring struts with firmer damping, the CL65 AMG is one of four versions of the rear-wheel-drive CL-Class coupe. Mercedes-Benz says that model can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. The CL-Class is a two-door equivalent to the German automaker’s high-end S-Class sedan.\n\nFor 2004, the CL500 got a seven-speed-automatic transmission, which replaced the prior five-speed unit. A DVD navigation system and MP3 player were added, and 18-inch wheels could be installed.\n\nAn AMG Sport Package is standard on 2006 versions of the CL500 and CL600. Keyless Go, a heated steering wheel, corner-illuminating fog lamps and an electronic trunk closer are now standard on the CL600. Options include Distronic Adaptive Cruise Control, which adjusts speed automatically to maintain a preset distance behind the vehicle ahead.\n\nExterior\nThe CL coupe’s styling themes echo the appearance of the S-Class sedan. Flowing fenders, four oval headlights, a wraparound back window and a smaller sloped grille that displays the familiar three-pointed-star emblem help give the CL-Class a personality all its own.\n\nBefitting its lofty-performance status, the CL55 AMG coupe has aerodynamic body trim, a firmer suspension and forged 18-inch wheels. The CL65 AMG features high-performance brakes and rolls on 19-inch, twin-spoke wheels.\n\nAll CL-Class coupes have Active Body Control, which is an active suspension system that continuously adjusts firmness to eliminate body roll and pitch during cornering, acceleration and braking. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights include washers. A power moonroof is standard.\n\nInterior\nCL-Class coupes accommodate up to four occupants and have bucketlike rear seats. The CL600 has unique Nappa leather upholstery. Each model contains either burl walnut or chestnut wood interior trim.\n\nA standard satellite-based navigation system has a touch-screen integrated into the dashboard. An SOS button for automatic emergency calling is tied to the Tele Aid system. A Bose audio system is installed.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available. A 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 goes into the CL500. The CL600 employs a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-12 that generates 493 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque. A 493-hp, supercharged 5.5-liter V-8 powers the CL55 AMG, and the CL65 AMG holds a 604-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 that cranks out a whopping 738 pounds-feet of torque. The CL500 has a seven-speed-automatic transmission with Touch Shift manual control. Other models use a five-speed-automatic transmission that permits manually selected gear changes. The CL55 AMG’s transmission incorporates a SpeedShift provision.\n\nSafety\nDoor-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain-type airbags that deploy from above the side windows, and side-impact airbags that protect the torsos of backseat occupants are standard. The front passenger’s airbag deploys at one of two levels. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes, being the only car of a particular type or price can put you in a lonely place — lonely enough that automakers usually avoid it, preferring to make their own copy of what everyone else is selling, and pricing it to match. The Mercedes-Benz CL-Class is an exception, an exclusive car in a couple of ways. For one thing, it’s a large coupe, and that’s a rare animal. In some ways it compares with the BMW 6 Series and the Jaguar XK coupe, but it’s larger and starts around $30,000 higher than those models. At $107,900, it has the highest base price and lowest sales numbers of any Mercedes — except the $495,000 SLR McLaren, which is an animal rare enough to be extinct after the 2009 model year. All in all, being a lone wolf seems to be working out just fine for the CL-Class.\n\nTo oversimplify, the CL-Class is a two-door version of Mercedes’ S-Class full-size sedan. Arguably, anyone who wants the best of both worlds can opt for the CLS-Class, which has four doors and the lines of a coupe, but Mercedes says that car’s smaller size and lower price appeal to different buyers altogether. See them compared here.\n\nThe CL-Class comprises the CL550, the CL600 and two high-performance AMG models, the CL63 and CL65. The CL550 is the only version that sticks to a naming convention Mercedes once followed pretty closely: 550 stands for the CL550’s 5.5-liter V-8 engine. After that, everything unravels: The CL600 has a turbocharged 5.5-liter V-12, the CL63 has a 6.2-liter V-8, and the CL65 has a turbocharged 6.0-liter V-12. I tested the CL550.\n\nS-Class Foundation\nThe CL-Class is an impressive car for one very good reason: It has everything that helps the S-Class dominate the full-size luxury-sedan market. Stretched taut over a coupe form, the sedan’s handsome lines look bolder, sportier and younger. The CL is 5.6 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the S-Class, its roofline is 2.2 inches lower and its wheelbase is 8.3 inches shorter. Inside, this translates to slightly more legroom, an inch less headroom and 2 inches more hip room in the front seats. It’s the backseat that takes a hit in the two-door, losing 10 inches of legroom and 2 inches of headroom … and a whole seat, come to think of it. The CL seats four, total.\n\nThe S-Class is quite roomy to start with, so even with the decreases, the CL’s backseat is serviceable for adults, providing they aren’t too tall and the front occupants don’t set their seats back all the way. The greater challenge is getting in and out. A chrome handle on the outboard side of the front backrests tilts them forward and sets the power seat in forward motion to ease entry, but there’s no avoiding the low roofline, which seems poised to ring your chimes no matter what you do. To compare, the BMW 650i and Jaguar XK, which are also four-seaters, don’t measure up in backseat headroom and legroom.\n\nThe CL’s trunk capacity gets nipped and tucked, too, measuring 13.5 cubic feet versus 16.3 in the S-Class and 15.9 in the CLS, though it beats the 650i’s 13 cubic feet and the XK’s 10.6 cubic feet. The greater problem is that the CL’s backseat doesn’t fold to extend the trunk space forward. This is common among large cars, and especially luxury models, whose owners supposedly don’t demand the feature. Still, when you need a little more space, it would be good to have, especially because the backseat itself is difficult to use for bags, parcels, etc.\n\nPerformance to Match Looks\nDespite its size and 4,650-pound curb weight, the CL550 has performance to match its looks. It shares its engine and seven-speed automatic transmission with the S-Class, and as of the 2009 model year, it comes only with 4Matic all-wheel drive — an option on the S-Class. 4Matic adds $3,000 to that sedan’s price, but even with the feature, the S550 costs $15,550 less than the CL. You also pay for all-wheel drive in terms of highway fuel economy. The CL is rated 14/21 mpg city/highway, matching the S-Class 4Matic and bringing a gas-guzzler tax of $1,300.\n\nAt least the thirsty drivetrain pays off, with zero-to-60-mph times around 5.5 seconds. (All the other CL-Class versions take about a second less — while increasing the price anywhere from about $35,000 to $96,000.) The seven-speed transmission is just as happy to accelerate gradually and smoothly, and steering-wheel-mounted paddles allow you to shift manually if that’s your thing. Or you can choose between Comfort and Sport settings, which make the transmission more or less reactive in automatic mode, and adjust the adaptive suspension’s firmness as well.\n\nLap of Luxury\nAs in the S-Class, the cabin is a highlight of the CL-Class, with exceptional-quality materials and perhaps the best-executed ambient lighting in the market, with a line of yellow-orange LEDs that encircle the cabin, providing both illumination and decoration after dark. The excellent Comand multimedia control system lets you select the intensity.\n\nMore than just luxury, it’s high-tech features that make a car like this exclusive, and the CL doesn’t disappoint. There are only a handful of stand-alone options, including a heated steering wheel, Bluetooth cell-phone connectivity, an iPod control cable and 19-inch wheels. The most interesting stuff comes in option packages, though, such as the radar-intensive Distronic Plus Package.\n\nHigh-Tech Features\nDistronic Plus takes adaptive cruise control — of which Mercedes was a pioneer — to another level. Adaptive cruise uses a front-mounted radar device to maintain the following distance from the car ahead. The “Plus” means Distronic allows the car to come to a complete stop, then accelerate again when the lead car takes off. I found the feature effective to the point of being freaky more than 95 percent of the time. Unfortunately, sometimes a car turning away in front of me or a sudden bend in the road caused a surge in acceleration, which once caused a hair-raising lurch toward an oncoming car. Obviously, the system should be used with extreme caution, preferably in stop-and-go highway traffic, not when intersections are likely.\n\nThe package also has rear-mounted radar units that provide a blind spot warning in either side mirror when another car is in your blind spot, an increasingly common feature.\n\nLess common is the Parking Guidance feature, which helps you parallel park. (Click on the video icon to the right to see a demonstration.) Unlike a feature first seen in Lexus’ flagship sedan, the LS 460, Parking Guidance doesn’t turn the steering wheel for you and back into the space; that requires electric power steering, which the CL lacks. Instead, graphics on the instrument panel show you exactly how far to back up and how much to turn the wheel in a few steps. It doesn’t have quite the gee-whiz factor, but it beats Lexus in a few areas: It can measure parking spaces as you drive along at less than 10 mph, and it won’t let you try to fit in one that’s too small. It allows you to be closer to the parked cars when you start out (Lexus puts you farther into the street), and there’s no complicated setup requiring the backup camera, which the Lexus requires. (Lincoln doesn’t have a direct competitor to the CL-Class, but it bears noting that its optional parking system combines the best of the Lexus and Mercedes systems.)\n\nAnother cool option is Night View Assist, a night-vision camera mounted high in the windshield that displays an image on the instrument panel’s LCD screen. It can see a larger area than your headlights illuminate, and because it can read heat signatures as well as light, animals and people really stick out in the image. Urban areas like Cars.com’s hometown, Chicago, are bright enough that Night View Assist isn’t truly necessary, but you could say the same of a $108,000 car. In the world of luxury cars, bragging rights are more important than necessity. Does your golf buddy’s car have night vision? I didn’t think so.\n\nSafety\nTypical of full-size luxury cars, the CL-Class hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it does have a boatload of safety features. There are nine airbags, including two frontal ones, a side-impact torso bag for each of the four seats, side curtain airbags and a driver’s knee airbag. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control are standard. For a list of all standard safety features, click here.\n\nCL-Class in the Market\nThe S-Class sedan outsells the CL-Class roughly 10 to 1, but that doesn’t make the big coupe a failure. Even though two-doors aren’t as popular here as they are in some foreign markets, Mercedes says the U.S. is the CL’s biggest market. Exclusivity is a major consideration among luxury-car buyers, and the rarity of large luxury coupes seems to be serving the CL-Class — and its buyers — well.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benz is notorious for introducing high-performance AMG editions of its passenger cars, and the CL-Class is no exception. A supercharged V-8 became available in the CL55 AMG for 2003. Mercedes-Benz is offering an even hotter CL65 AMG with a 604-horsepower twin-turbo V-12 for the 2005 model year.\n\nEquipped with Active Body Control and special AMG spring struts with firmer damping, the CL65 AMG is one of four versions of the rear-wheel-drive CL-Class. The CL-Class is a two-door equivalent to the German automaker’s high-end S-Class sedan.\n\nFor 2004, the CL500 got a seven-speed-automatic transmission, which replaced the prior five-speed unit. A DVD navigation system and MP3 player were added, and 18-inch wheels could be installed. Options include Distronic Adaptive Cruise Control, which adjusts speed automatically to maintain a preset distance behind the vehicle ahead.\n\nExterior\nThe coupe’s styling themes echo the appearance of the S-Class sedan. Flowing fenders, four oval headlights, a wraparound back window and a smaller sloped grille that displays the familiar three-pointed-star emblem help give the CL-Class a personality all its own. Befitting its lofty-performance status, the CL55 AMG coupe has aerodynamic body trim, a firmer suspension and 18-inch wheels. The new CL65 AMG features high-performance brakes and rolls on 19-inch twin-spoke wheels.\n\nAll CL-Class coupes have Active Body Control, which is an active suspension system that continuously adjusts firmness to eliminate body roll and pitch during cornering, acceleration and braking. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights include washers. A power moonroof is standard.\n\nInterior\nThe CL-Class accommodates up to four occupants and has bucketlike rear seats. The CL600 has unique Nappa leather upholstery and either burl walnut or chestnut interior trim.\n\nA standard satellite-based navigation system has a touchscreen integrated into the dashboard. An SOS button for automatic emergency calling is tied to the Tele Aid system. A Bose audio system is installed.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available. A 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 goes into the CL500. The CL600 employs a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-12 that generates 493 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque. A 493-hp, supercharged 5.5-liter V-8 powers the CL55 AMG, and the new CL65 AMG holds a 604-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 that generates a whopping 738 pounds-feet of torque. The CL500 has a seven-speed-automatic transmission with Touch Shift manual control. Other models have a five-speed-automatic transmission that permits manually selected gear changes. The CL55 AMG and CL65 AMG are equipped with a SpeedShift provision.\n\nSafety\nDoor-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain-type airbags that deploy from above the side windows, and side-impact airbags that protect the torsos of backseat occupants are standard. The front passenger’s airbag deploys at one of two levels. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2011 about the 2011 Mercedes-Benz CL550. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2011 Mercedes-Benz CL550 is stunning — both to look at and to drive — in a way not many cars are.\n\nThe CL550 is plenty quick, though it’s not at the top of the CL-Class heap in terms of power. Nor is it practical, economical or subtle; it’s simply a gorgeous automobile for people who can afford to not care about such things — or its $113,000-plus starting price.\n\nExterior\nThe coupe version of the S-Class sedan, the CL-Class sits very near the top of the Mercedes-Benz range, and would be a rare thing in anybody’s lineup: a large coupe. And when I say large, I mean it: The CL is roughly 200 inches long. That’s the same length as a GMC Acadia — a crossover that seats up to eight people in three rows (see them compared).\n\nStill, the CL is one of the best-looking cars on the road. That’s partly due to the fact that Mercedes gave it a stretched-out form; there’s a low, sloping roof and no pillars between the front and rear side windows. The car is also fairly wide, and the overall impression is of a very low, wide car. Interestingly, it’s not hard to get in and out of the front seats. I never felt like I was falling onto the ground, as I have in other coupes.\n\nThe CL was restyled for 2011, with a reworked front end, and LED running lights and taillights. The CL wasn’t ugly before, but I think the changes were done well. (Compare a 2011 to a 2010 here.)\n\nInterior\nAs much as I like how the CL looks from the outside, it’s on the inside that Mercedes outdoes the competition: Everything you see or touch looks and feels good. If I shelled out the cash for a CL, I’d feel like I got my money’s worth every time I sat in it. And it’s not just that the interior is opulent — though it is — but that it also manages to be functional.\n\nMercedes uses its Comand multifunction knob and display to control navigation, audio and some seat settings, in lieu of a touch-screen. The car also provides enough buttons for things like fan speed, defroster and radio volume that you only have to use Comand for a few select functions. It’s a well-integrated system (more on the gadgets later), but the immediate effect is that it creates a very clean, uncluttered interior.\n\nNow for the pretty stuff: The lack of a middle roof pillar means a lot of light comes into the cabin and you never feel claustrophobic in the CL. The next thing that caught my eye was the leather, both the amount and the quality. There are few surfaces not covered in leather, and there’s plenty of exposed stitching, which always looks nice. It looks especially nice because Mercedes chose thread that’s the same color as the leather, rather than going for a contrasting style. It also feels good when you touch it. Anybody can put leather in a car, but not everybody does it as well as Mercedes. The same holds true for the wood trim: I’m not a fan of the stuff on principle, but Mercedes picked good-looking materials and used them well.\n\nThe controls, vents and various buttons all have a good, solid feel to them. That’s to be expected, but some automakers miss the details. Mercedes doesn’t.\n\nRoom in the backseat is worth mentioning: It’s tolerable, but I wanted more space for my feet and a touch more headroom. I’m just over 6 feet tall, so folks of more average height might be slightly more comfortable. Larger people, though, should only be expected to ride short distances in the rear of the CL.\n\nDriving, Part One\nThis might be the time when you’ll wonder if you are getting your money’s worth, especially if you’re a performance junkie. The CL550 we tested is the base model of the CL range. All other versions — CL600, CL63 AMG and CL65 AMG — offer more power.\n\nThe V-8 in the CL550 is new for 2011 and offers more power than the previous engine (429 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque, up from 382 hp and 391 pounds-feet in 2010).\n\nMercedes-Benz CL-Class\nCL550\t429-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8\nCL600\t510-hp, twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-12\nCL63 AMG\t536-hp, twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8*\nCL65 AMG\t621-hp, twin-turbocharged, 6.0-liter V-12\n*An optional performance package bumps power to 563 hp.\n\nThe engine defaults to an Economy setting that moves you from a standstill in 2nd gear, and that’s OK. The problem is that when you press slightly harder to get a bit more power, you got a lot more power. It snapped my head back on many occasions, and I never adjusted to the Economy mode in all the time I spent driving the CL550.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I don’t mind the power, but I do mind its surprising, sudden application. When I was able to just cruise along the road, Economy mode was fine — but heaven help you if you need to accelerate suddenly. Other editors noticed a lag going from a stop or from slow speeds.\n\nYou can also choose a Sport setting that shifts the transmission at higher engine speeds and is more sensitive to accelerator inputs. I preferred this mode simply because it was more predictable. (It also seemed to allow the engine to make more of a snarling sound than the Economy mode — a good, slightly menacing sound.)\n\nIn either mode, the transmission — a seven-speed automatic — kicked down to lower gears quickly for passing, and it felt all but seamless when moving between gears.\n\nI was less fond of the steering. The CL550 has Mercedes’ Direct Steering system, which has a variable-ratio steering rack for better response in tight corners. It’s certainly quick to respond, but it felt numb. Also, the steering is very light and felt lighter the faster I went — not reassuring at highway speeds. At times, I felt like I was steering a video game rather than handling a car. I would’ve liked more feedback.\n\nDriving, Part Two\nThe CL’s standard Airmatic suspension is hard to fault. It can operate in either its default Comfort setting or a firmer Sport setting. Without going into technical details, I’ll say that it absorbs bumps like little else I’ve driven.\n\nI drove the CL on my normal route and experienced nothing but a muted “whump” over a road imperfection that makes other cars crash and bang. Granted, that was in Comfort mode, but when I switched to Sport I didn’t notice any real degradation in ride quality, just a slight jiggle on really bumpy roads.\n\nWhere I really noticed the difference while driving in Sport mode was on highway on-ramps; it does a nice job of holding the car steady. That, combined with the CL’s standard all-wheel drive, lends a lot of confidence at sane — but still fast — speeds. It’s stable and gets a great amount of grip. I didn’t get anywhere near the CL550’s limit; there was always enough grip and comfort to put a big smile on my face.\n\nOne thing with which I wasn’t as enamored was the need for Mercedes’ optional blind spot warning system, which I normally don’t use. Unfortunately, the CL550’s standard mirrors are just too small to be of much use. As far as highway driving goes, the mirror issue is the only major fault I noticed. Other editors pointed out that there was absolutely no road or wind noise, making the CL an excellent road-trip car.\n\nGadgets\nThe CL’s standard equipment list is long. Our test car came with a number of option packages; here are some of the highlights:\n\nFor starters, the blind spot monitors are included in a package that also gives you adaptive cruise control, which maintains a set following distance from the car in front of you, even if it slows. With that package, you also get lane-keeping assist, which thrums the steering wheel if you go over a lane marker without signaling. I tried it out, and it works obtrusively enough to alert you that you’ve strayed, but not so harshly that you think you’ve broken something and/or are about to die.\n\nA Premium Package includes massaging front seats. They’re nice, work as advertised and can be set to Active mode, meaning the same bolsters that massage you can inflate to hold you in your seat better when you make a turn, then deflate when you hit the straightaway. I skipped the Active setting and snugged the bolsters up to my body just for driving around; it felt more natural and comfortable than having the seat suddenly start pushing on me.\n\nThe Premium Package also includes Night View Assist PLUS, which uses invisible infrared headlights to display a view of the road on the screen where the speedometer usually appears. It’s a good idea, but not necessary in the city, where there’s plenty of ambient light to begin with. Perhaps if I lived in the country it would have impressed me more.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Mileage\nThe CL has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, nor is there reliability data for it. The CL550’s mileage is estimated to be 15/23 mpg city/highway, and it takes premium gasoline.\n\nCL550 in the Market\nThe CL550’s price is enough to guarantee it a solid spot in the market. In other words, if you can afford more than $100,000 for a car that doesn’t have rear doors, who cares if it’s not the fastest version out there? I doubt you’ll feel like you’re getting ripped off by not choosing the more powerful CL600 or an AMG version. The CL550 is still a stunner.\n\nAnd that’s the appeal of the CL550: It’s not something I judge by how well it carries groceries, handles child seats or rips around a racetrack. It’s more logical to judge it by the luxury experience it provides, and in that sense the CL550 does quite well.\n\nIf your criteria include owning the most beautiful car on the block, and having it also be luxurious and comfortable, it will be hard to find something better than this.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Mercedes-Benz CL550 is stunning — both to look at and to drive — in a way not many cars are.\n\nThe CL550 is plenty quick, though it’s not at the top of the CL-Class heap in terms of power. Nor is it practical, economical or subtle; it’s simply a gorgeous automobile for people who can afford to not care about such things — or its $113,000-plus starting price.\n \nExterior\nThe coupe version of the S-Class sedan, the CL-Class sits very near the top of the Mercedes-Benz range, and would be a rare thing in anybody’s lineup: a large coupe. And when I say large, I mean it: The CL is roughly 200 inches long. That’s the same length as a GMC Acadia — a crossover that seats up to eight people in three rows (see them compared).\n\nStill, the CL is one of the best-looking cars on the road. That’s partly due to the fact that Mercedes gave it a stretched-out form; there’s a low, sloping roof and no pillars between the front and rear side windows. The car is also fairly wide, and the overall impression is of a very low, wide car. Interestingly, it’s not hard to get in and out of the front seats. I never felt like I was falling onto the ground, as I have in other coupes.\n\nThe CL was restyled for 2011, with a reworked front end, and LED running lights and taillights. The CL wasn’t ugly before, but I think the changes were done well. (Compare a 2011 to a 2010 here.)\n\nInterior\nAs much as I like how the CL looks from the outside, it’s on the inside that Mercedes outdoes the competition: Everything you see or touch looks and feels good. If I shelled out the cash for a CL, I’d feel like I got my money’s worth every time I sat in it. And it’s not just that the interior is opulent — though it is — but that it also manages to be functional.\n\nMercedes uses its Comand multifunction knob and display to control navigation, audio and some seat settings, in lieu of a touch-screen. The car also provides enough buttons for things like fan speed, defroster and radio volume that you only have to use Comand for a few select functions. It’s a well-integrated system (more on the gadgets later), but the immediate effect is that it creates a very clean, uncluttered interior.\n\nNow for the pretty stuff: The lack of a middle roof pillar means a lot of light comes into the cabin and you never feel claustrophobic in the CL. The next thing that caught my eye was the leather, both the amount and the quality. There are few surfaces not covered in leather, and there’s plenty of exposed stitching, which always looks nice. It looks especially nice because Mercedes chose thread that’s the same color as the leather, rather than going for a contrasting style. It also feels good when you touch it. Anybody can put leather in a car, but not everybody does it as well as Mercedes. The same holds true for the wood trim: I’m not a fan of the stuff on principle, but Mercedes picked good-looking materials and used them well.\n\nThe controls, vents and various buttons all have a good, solid feel to them. That’s to be expected, but some automakers miss the details. Mercedes doesn’t.\n\nRoom in the backseat is worth mentioning: It’s tolerable, but I wanted more space for my feet and a touch more headroom. I’m just over 6 feet tall, so folks of more average height might be slightly more comfortable. Larger people, though, should only be expected to ride short distances in the rear of the CL.\n\nDriving, Part One\nThis might be the time when you’ll wonder if you are getting your money’s worth, especially if you’re a performance junkie. The CL550 we tested is the base model of the CL range. All other versions — CL600, CL63 AMG and CL65 AMG — offer more power.\n\nThe V-8 in the CL550 is new for 2011 and offers more power than the previous engine (429 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque, up from 382 hp and 391 pounds-feet in 2010).\n\n \n\nMercedes-Benz CL-Class\n CL550\t 429-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8\n CL600\t 510-hp, twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-12\n CL63 AMG\t 536-hp, twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8*\n CL65 AMG\t 621-hp, twin-turbocharged, 6.0-liter V-12\n*An optional performance package bumps power to 563 hp.\n\n \n\nThe engine defaults to an Economy setting that moves you from a standstill in 2nd gear, and that’s OK. The problem is that when you press slightly harder to get a bit more power, you got a lot more power. It snapped my head back on many occasions, and I never adjusted to the Economy mode in all the time I spent driving the CL550.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I don’t mind the power, but I do mind its surprising, sudden application. When I was able to just cruise along the road, Economy mode was fine — but heaven help you if you need to accelerate suddenly. Other editors noticed a lag going from a stop or from slow speeds.\n\nYou can also choose a Sport setting that shifts the transmission at higher engine speeds and is more sensitive to accelerator inputs. I preferred this mode simply because it was more predictable. (It also seemed to allow the engine to make more of a snarling sound than the Economy mode — a good, slightly menacing sound.)\n\nIn either mode, the transmission — a seven-speed automatic — kicked down to lower gears quickly for passing, and it felt all but seamless when moving between gears.\n\nI was less fond of the steering. The CL550 has Mercedes’ Direct Steering system, which has a variable-ratio steering rack for better response in tight corners. It’s certainly quick to respond, but it felt numb. Also, the steering is very light and felt lighter the faster I went — not reassuring at highway speeds. At times, I felt like I was steering a video game rather than handling a car. I would’ve liked more feedback.\n\nDriving, Part Two\nThe CL’s standard Airmatic suspension is hard to fault. It can operate in either its default Comfort setting or a firmer Sport setting. Without going into technical details, I’ll say that it absorbs bumps like little else I’ve driven.\n\nI drove the CL on my normal route and experienced nothing but a muted “whump” over a road imperfection that makes other cars crash and bang. Granted, that was in Comfort mode, but when I switched to Sport I didn’t notice any real degradation in ride quality, just a slight jiggle on really bumpy roads.\n\nWhere I really noticed the difference while driving in Sport mode was on highway on-ramps; it does a nice job of holding the car steady. That, combined with the CL’s standard all-wheel drive, lends a lot of confidence at sane — but still fast — speeds. It’s stable and gets a great amount of grip. I didn’t get anywhere near the CL550’s limit; there was always enough grip and comfort to put a big smile on my face.\n\nOne thing with which I wasn’t as enamored was the need for Mercedes’ optional blind spot warning system, which I normally don’t use. Unfortunately, the CL550’s standard mirrors are just too small to be of much use. As far as highway driving goes, the mirror issue is the only major fault I noticed. Other editors pointed out that there was absolutely no road or wind noise, making the CL an excellent road-trip car.\n\nGadgets\nThe CL’s standard equipment list is long. Our test car came with a number of option packages; here are some of the highlights:\n\nFor starters, the blind spot monitors are included in a package that also gives you adaptive cruise control, which maintains a set following distance from the car in front of you, even if it slows. With that package, you also get lane-keeping assist, which thrums the steering wheel if you go over a lane marker without signaling. I tried it out, and it works obtrusively enough to alert you that you’ve strayed, but not so harshly that you think you’ve broken something and/or are about to die.\n\nA Premium Package includes massaging front seats. They’re nice, work as advertised and can be set to Active mode, meaning the same bolsters that massage you can inflate to hold you in your seat better when you make a turn, then deflate when you hit the straightaway. I skipped the Active setting and snugged the bolsters up to my body just for driving around; it felt more natural and comfortable than having the seat suddenly start pushing on me.\n\nThe Premium Package also includes Night View Assist PLUS, which uses invisible infrared headlights to display a view of the road on the screen where the speedometer usually appears. It’s a good idea, but not necessary in the city, where there’s plenty of ambient light to begin with. Perhaps if I lived in the country it would have impressed me more.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Mileage\nThe CL has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, nor is there reliability data for it. The CL550’s mileage is estimated to be 15/23 mpg city/highway, and it takes premium gasoline.\n\nCL550 in the Market\nThe CL550’s price is enough to guarantee it a solid spot in the market. In other words, if you can afford more than $100,000 for a car that doesn’t have rear doors, who cares if it’s not the fastest version out there? I doubt you’ll feel like you’re getting ripped off by not choosing the more powerful CL600 or an AMG version. The CL550 is still a stunner.\n\nAnd that’s the appeal of the CL550: It’s not something I judge by how well it carries groceries, handles child seats or rips around a racetrack. It’s more logical to judge it by the luxury experience it provides, and in that sense the CL550 does quite well.\n\nIf your criteria include owning the most beautiful car on the block, and having it also be luxurious and comfortable, it will be hard to find something better than this.\n\n \n\nSend Bill an email",
