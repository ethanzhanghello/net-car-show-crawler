      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has committed to electrification in a big way, currently offering five different electric vehicles (six, if you count the Maybach version of the EQS SUV separately, which we’re not). Right in the middle of that broad lineup sits the EQE Sedan, which debuted for the 2023 model year alongside the similarly mid-sized EQE SUV. For 2025, the EQE Sedan gets a new battery pack and interior enhancements.\n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE Review: Smaller Size, Same Issues\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQE Sedan is on sale now. Full line pricing, including the $1,150 destination fee, is as follows:\n\n350+: $76,050\n350 4Matic: $79,050\n500 4Matic: $87,050\nAMG EQE: $108,050\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Mercedes-EQ EQE Sedan?\n\nThe 2025 EQE Sedan’s hard-hitting news is a new battery pack with a 96-kilowatt-hour capacity. But the bigger pack is only installed in the EQE350+ and EQE500 4Matic; the 350 4Matic and AMG EQE soldier on with a 90.6-kWh pack. The all-electric sedan also sees updated regenerative braking software.\n\nFrom there, developments for the EQE Sedan get a little softer, as in literally soft: The optional multicontour front seats gain head-restraint pillows, and the available leather upholstery now includes throw pillows for the rear passengers (although we suppose you could throw them anywhere). Soft-close doors that prevent slamming and latch themselves are also now available.\n\nPowertrain Specs and Range\n\nThe 2025 EQE Sedan is available with four different powertrains. At the bottom of the pyramid is the EQE350+, which has a single electric motor driving the rear wheels with 288 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque. EPA-rated range for the 350+ is 308 miles. The EQE350 4Matic adds a motor on the front axle for all-wheel drive; total horsepower is unchanged at 288, but torque jumps to 564 pounds-feet. The 350 4Matic is good for 267 miles on a charge.\n\nNot so long ago, a Mercedes with a “500” badge would have packed a burly V-8 engine under the hood. In the EQE500 4Matic, though, that number denotes two electric motors with a combined 402 hp (a figure past Mercedes powertrain engineers would have been thrilled to coax from a normally aspirated V-8) and 633 pounds-feet (twist they only could have realized with turbochargers). The larger battery helps the higher-output 4Matic reach nearly as far as the 350, with an EPA-rated range of 266 miles.\n\nThose who take their ecologically conscious luxury with a frothy flagon of punch will find the AMG EQE Sedan appealing. Here, two motors produce a nominal 617 hp and 701 pounds-feet of torque combined, but they can squeeze out 677 hp and 738 pounds-feet for brief spurts that allow it to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.2 seconds, per Mercedes. (That betters the EQE500 by 1.3 seconds and the 350 4Matic and 350+ by 2.8 and 3 seconds, respectively.) The trade-off for all that power, however, is needing to find a plug every 220 miles.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety technology on the EQE Sedan includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, a driver attention monitor, automatic high beams, a 360-degree parking camera and automated parking.\n\nThe EQE350+ rides on 20-inch wheels and features LED head- and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, and keyless entry and start. It is upholstered in synthetic leather and has power-adjustable heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. The standard tech suite includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, a 15-speaker Burmester surround sound system, and a 12.8-inch touchscreen with navigation, voice control, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The EQE350 4Matic doesn’t add any standard features beyond the powertrain upgrades.\n\nThe EQE500 4Matic includes Mercedes-Benz’s new Hyperscreen digital dashboard, which spans from A-pillar to A-pillar with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, 17.7-inch central touchscreen and another 12.3-inch touchscreen for the passenger, all beneath a single piece of glass.\n\nAt the top of the lineup, the AMG EQE Sedan rides on an adaptive air suspension with rear-wheel steering and features performance-tuned AWD logic and upgraded brakes. Its safety suite gains adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, automated lane changes, emergency stop assist and road-sign recognition. The AMG also includes upgraded exterior lighting, augmented-reality navigation and a heated steering wheel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE500 a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nDriving 3 EVs in Zero-Degree Temps: What Could Go Wrong?\nResearch Mercedes-Benz\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe Mercedes-EQ EQE is a five-seat, luxury all-electric vehicle that can be had as a slinky sedan or a more upright SUV; both are essentially smaller, less expensive versions of the Mercedes-EQ EQS Sedan and SUV. Range and performance depend largely on which drivetrain an EQE buyer chooses. Serving duty in EQE350 trims is a single electric motor that sends 288 horsepower to the rear wheels. Dual-motor all-wheel drive is available on EQE350 trims, but output with AWD stands pat at 288 hp. The EQE500 and high-performance AMG EQE trims come standard with a dual-motor AWD powertrain; the EQE500 has 402 hp, while the AMG EQE has 617 hp in standard form or 677 hp with an optional AMG Dynamic Plus Package. \n\nThe EQE Sedan’s rivals include the Audi E-Tron GT, Genesis Electrified G80, Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S. The EQE SUV competes with the Audi Q8 e-Tron, BMW iX, Cadillac Lyriq, Genesis Electrified GV70 and GV60, Porsche Macan EV and Tesla Model X.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe EQE range debuted for 2023, but Mercedes has made a few improvements and additions for 2024. New battery tech is said to give a modest boost to range, and a heat pump is now standard for better efficiency in cold weather. The regenerative braking system gets updated software for a more natural pedal feel. The AMG EQE was offered only as a sedan for 2023, but an SUV version joins the line this year.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE Have?\n\nThe EQE’s EPA-estimated driving range runs from 230 to 307 miles, depending on body style, trim level and drive wheels.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Charge the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nAccording to Mercedes, the EQE’s battery can be charged from 10% to 100% in approximately 10 hours when using a 240-volt Level 2 charger. A DC fast charger requires around 32 minutes to recharge the battery from 10% to 80%.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPanoramic sunroof\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n15-speaker Burmester audio system\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\n360-degree camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n56-inch Hyperscreen full-width dashboard display\nLeather upholstery\nHead-up instrument display\nFour-zone climate control\nInterior air filtration and fragrance system\nHeated windshield wipers\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nAir suspension\nRear-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-EQ EQE?\n\nThe Mercedes-EQ EQE is a technological tour de force in either of its two available body styles, and it boasts posher trimmings than many of its EV rivals. Range isn’t class-leading, but it is competitive — unless a buyer prefers the high-performance, electron-gobbling AMG version. Cabin quality is generally excellent, though the onboard tech requires lots of patience to master. A small rear window in the sedan limits outward visibility, and the rear seat bottom cushions are high and hinder rear headroom. Of the two, the roomier SUV model is the more practical (if slightly pricier) choice.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Of all the new Mercedes-EQ models, this version might be the perfect formula: smashing performance, a comfortable cabin, usable cargo space, excellent driving dynamics and not too much quirk.\n\nVersus the competition: The EQE500 SUV is far more upscale and luxurious than anything from Tesla, and it doesn’t trip the weird styling alarm like a BMW iX. \n\nMercedes-Benz has taken an interesting path with its electrification strategy. While some luxury brands are creating electrified versions of their traditional offerings, Mercedes-Benz has created an entirely new electric lineup, complete with its own platforms, interiors, styling, and ethos. The EQ lineup consists of the big EQS Sedan and SUV, the compact EQB SUV, and the mid-size EQE Sedan and SUV — the latter of which is the subject of this review. \n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQB 300 Review: A Solid EV With Room for Improvement\n\nI’ve driven all of the EQ offerings and found them to be a bit of a mixed bag, but with the EQE SUV, I think I’ve finally found one that gets the formula right. This vehicle is a successful mix of high technology and excellent driving dynamics packaged in a sensible layout that works better than the EQ sedans. \n\nPick Your Propulsion\n\nThere are four EQE SUV models, starting with the 350+. This version has rear-wheel drive and a single motor that makes 288 horsepower and 417 pounds-feet of torque, with an EPA-rated 279 miles of range from its 90.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. Next up is the EQE350 4Matic, which uses a dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup that still makes 288 hp system total but with more torque: 564 pounds-feet. Its range and battery capacity, however, are lower, with 253 miles of estimated range from an 89-kWh pack. Topping the regular range is the EQE500 4Matic, again with two motors and AWD but packing system totals of 402 hp and 633 pounds-feet of torque. It has an estimated driving range of 269 miles from its 90.6-kWh battery. If you’d like to go all out, the fourth model is a dual-motor AWD AMG EQE, which pumps out 617 hp and 701 pounds-feet of torque but has just 235 miles of driving range from its 90.6-kWh battery.\n\nI drove an EQE500 4Matic, and while it’s not the fire-breathing AMG model, it does feature the more powerful motors and 269-mile range. It’s also not as crazy expensive as the top model, and it delivers an excellent mix of performance, comfort and utility.\n\n1 Jellybean, 3 Sizes\n\nThe Mercedes-EQ lineup has been criticized for its generic styling, and that’s fair; it really is generic — especially the SUVs. The sedans are more quirky and distinctive thanks to their dramatically futuristic, cab-forward style and sweeping, arched rooflines that prioritize aerodynamics over aesthetics. The SUVs are not quirky; the design is clean and uncomplicated, with a tacked-on faux grille, amorphous head- and taillights, and a fairly traditional two-box shape. It doesn’t telegraph “Mercedes-Benz” at all. The EQE could be from just about any brand; the only Mercedes styling cues are the wheel designs and a big three-pointed star up front. \n\nIn a world where Hyundai, Kia and even Cadillac are making incredible, dramatically styled vehicles that are moving their brands into an eventual all-electric future, this feels like a safe step sideways for Mercedes design. The EQE SUV is something of a technological marvel given the extraordinary engineering that’s gone into it, but you’d never know that from looking at it. The fact that it’s also almost indistinguishable from the smaller EQB and larger EQS SUVs doesn’t help the situation. \n\nThe Sweet Spot Inside\n\nI have complaints about the EQE and EQS sedans’ interiors, mostly related to their odd packaging. The cars’ super-short hoods and long rooflines should afford a commanding view forward — a benefit of the cab-forward design aesthetic (see Chrysler Corp.’s 1990s-era sedans for another example of this style) — but it doesn’t because of their crazy high, imposing dashboards. The EQE SUV also has a big dashboard, but given it’s an SUV with taller seating, you don’t get quite the same sensation of looking over a cliff to see out the front. Visibility isn’t as good as it could be, but it’s not nearly as compromised as it is in the EQE Sedan, especially to the rear. While that car gives drivers just a tiny gun-slit rear window, the SUV has a taller (but oddly narrow) back window. \n\nMaterials quality in the EQE SUV matches the rest of the EQ lineup. It’s an interesting mix of nice surfaces, glass screens and often hollow-sounding panels. The seats, however, are impeccable in any position — another improvement over the EQE Sedan. The front seats are large, supportive and adjustable for people of all shapes and sizes, and there’s plenty of headroom in front and back — something that can’t be said of the sedans, with their swoopy rooflines and corresponding constrained airspace. The SUV’s backseat legroom is also good, and the higher rear bench than you get in the sedan makes it comfy in any position. \n\nThe EQE SUV has plentiful cargo space behind the backseat. Whereas the sedan’s trunk space is surprisingly small, the SUV has no such issues — and its formal, upright roofline makes the EQE SUV’s interior a more usable space than what you’ll get in a “coupe-style SUV” like a Tesla Model Y or one of Mercedes’ gas-powered models, like the GLE Coupe. There’s no frunk, however; you can’t even open the hood. (Mercedes installed a massive air purifier in there, so there’s nothing to see anyway.) Dropping the rear seats creates even more luggage space, making this a genuinely useful vehicle, as well as a comfortable and luxurious one. \n\nElectric Operation\n\nThe EQE SUV is comfy and useful, and it feels and looks better than its sedan counterpart, but the point of the thing is its electric operation — which is generally excellent, like the rest of the EQ lineup. If you want, the car can make sounds (it’s selectable in a menu), but I prefer my EVs to be as silent as possible, and the EQE SUV delivers. Acceleration is electric-car smooth and comes in a rush if you put your foot down; there is a lot of torque on tap. There kind of needs to be, though, as the EQE SUV has a big battery, and big batteries are heavy. And you do feel the mass of this vehicle; it shows up in the ride quality and when you change directions.\n\nThe ride is quite smooth and well damped, but body roll is a bit more pronounced than you might expect. It’s hard to hide full-size-SUV-type curb weight — it’s around 5,600 pounds — in a mid-size SUV, but at least the mass is low in the EQE SUV’s chassis. That lower center of gravity minimizes roll, but the heft is still obvious; you’ll feel it in the bump absorption and rebound of the suspension on rougher roads. My test model came equipped with 21-inch AMG multispoke wheels, but the adaptive suspension did an excellent job ironing out the harsh impacts of Chicago’s broken road surfaces.\n\nThe EQE SUV’s nimbleness is also a welcome surprise, and that has a lot to do with the EQE500 SUV’s standard rear-wheel steering. It allows the rear wheels to turn counter to the front ones at low speeds, reducing the vehicle’s turning circle considerably and boosting its agility on twisty roads. At higher speeds, the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front ones, allowing for quick lane-changing maneuvers on the highway. It’s a magical system you’ll wish was on more vehicles once you experience it — that’s how transformative four-wheel steering is for vehicle dynamics. It’s available on EQE and EQS models, both sedans and SUVs, and it makes big, heavy luxury EVs drive like models a size smaller. \n\nPerhaps the most surprising part about my experience with the EQE500 SUV was its range. It’s rated at a respectable 269 miles on a full charge, and it delivered on that promise in highway miles. That’s almost unheard of given highway miles are a lot more challenging for an EV than city miles, but the EQE SUV managed it even with the climate controls actively keeping the cabin at a comfortable temperature in humid Illinois summer heat. The EQE SUV has decent DC fast-charging capability, as well, but it can only go up to 170 kilowatts, so don’t go plugging into a 350-kW DC fast charger and denying someone with, say, a Lucid Air or Porsche Taycan a faster charging experience. \n\nThe Future Ain’t Cheap\n\nElectric cars are naturally more expensive than their conventional gasoline counterparts, and the EQ lineup is no exception. The base EQE350+ RWD model and the AWD EQE350 4Matic both start at $79,050 (all prices include destination fee) — which makes you wonder who will pick a 350+ when AWD is available at no extra cost. Step up to an EQE500 4Matic SUV and you’ll start at $90,650. Mercedes offers three trim levels within each variant’s range: Premium, Exclusive and Pinnacle, each bringing more features and luxury. My test model was a top Pinnacle trim loaded with nearly every option available, and it stickered at a lofty $106,600 — a bit cringey for a mid-size SUV. It can go even higher if you opt for the AMG version: That one starts at $110,450 and can top out around $135,000 when fully optioned up. \n\nThose numbers are in the ballpark of the EQE’s competition. The very comparable BMW iX ranges from just over $85,000 to more than $120,000, while a Tesla Model X runs from around $81,000 to $117,000 as of publication. You won’t get nearly the same level of luxury amenities in the Tesla, but you will get “falcon doors,” if you’re into that. You can spend even more money if you want something a little larger, like Mercedes’ EQS SUV, which can seat two extra people in its optional third row. Much of what we like and don’t like about the EQE SUV applies to the EQS SUV given how similar their ethos is. \n\nAll in all, the EQE SUV really seems to be the sweet spot of the EQ lineup. It’s more practical than the sedans, with more cargo and occupant space and a better seating position, yet it’s still blessed with excellent range and vehicle dynamics. It’s worth considering if you’re into the luxury electric SUV idea. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV: AMG Goes All Electric\n2024 Mercedes-EQ EQB Updated Inside and Out, Aligned With Rest of EV Lineup\nElite EQ: 2024 Mercedes-Maybach EQS680 SUV Priced From $181K\nFirst Test: What It’s Like Using Mercedes-Benz’s Drive Pilot Automated Driving System\nShop for a 2023 Mercedes-EQ EQE500 SUV\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
