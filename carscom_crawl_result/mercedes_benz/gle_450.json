      "expert_review": "The craze for SUVs may be reaching its zenith. Every automaker sells them, and new models face an uphill battle to try and gain customers from the vehicles that have enjoyed years of success — models like this one: the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class. It started life in 1998 as the original luxury crossover, the ML-Class, made here in America and the trigger for an onslaught of tall-roofed, off-roadable, all-wheel-drive luxury wagons that have surpassed the traditional sedans as the most popular models in the luxury categories.\n\nRelated: Here’s Our Full Preview of the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class\n\nThis latest version, arriving next year as a 2020 model, is set to renew Mercedes-Benz’s primacy in the field, thanks to a technology-laden, ultra-luxurious, astonishingly capable offering that’s likely to reset the bar.\n\nAn Excellent Driving Experience\n\nWhat makes it so good? It’s a confluence of things, starting first with how it drives. There will be two GLE-Class models to start — the GLE350, equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine good for 255 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque, and the GLE450 that uses a turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine with a mild-hybrid system, producing 362 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the GLE350; all-wheel drive is an option here and standard on the GLE450. I drove both models in the Texas Hill Country north of San Antonio at Mercedes’ media introduction and came away impressed with both powertrains. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nThe four-cylinder has plenty of usable around-town power, accelerating smartly once rolling but not providing that much oomph from a standing start. Most drivers will find it perfectly adequate, but for anyone requiring a little more confidence in their daily drive or hauling around a full load of passengers regularly, the six-cylinder GLE450 is the one to get. The EQ Boost 48-volt mild-hybrid system is seamlessly integrated, offering up quicker acceleration in all conditions but also boosting the efficiency of the GLE450 versus its competitors, according to Mercedes-Benz. In both powertrains, the nine-speed automatic transmission is smooth to the point of near invisibility, shifting gears with such unobtrusive operation as to make you forget it has any gears at all. Power comes on in a rush regardless of how you’re driving — there’s never any hunting, never finding yourself in the wrong gear, never any clunky operation at all. Both of these powertrains are beautifully tuned but decidedly geared more toward stately cruising than sporty demeanor. \n\nCurvy, But Not the Styling\n\nThe GLE’s ride and handling characteristics are essentially a technology showcase. Three suspension options are available — a standard, non-adjustable steel-spring one, an adjustable air-spring suspension and the top-of-the-line option, a fully active electronic suspension that combines the air springs with adaptive dampers. The air suspension option on the GLE350 provides a smooth, comfortable ride with excellent road isolation and confident body motion control, but the real gem is the new E-Active Body Control fully active suspension, available only on the GLE450 due to its requirement of the 48-volt vehicle architecture. It uses the car’s forward-scanning cameras and mapping data to tilt the car into corners by adjusting the electric dampers at each corner independently. The effect is to counteract centrifugal force by leaning the GLE into a corner, much like a high-speed train or a motorcycle does, resulting in an astonishing effect for the vehicle’s occupants. In addition to a glass-smooth ride over some truly awful road conditions, you’ll notice that you sweep through corners faster as you’re not being thrown opposite the direction of travel. It counters the inertia the passengers feel when a car enters a bend, and it is one of the most amazing driving sensations I’ve had in any SUV. \n\nThis active suspension feature is activated in three of the GLE450’s several drive modes. In Comfort mode, it’s switched off — and it’s fun to switch between Comfort and the others (Curve, Sport and Sport Plus) to feel the difference the active suspension makes. The GLE450 also features an Eco mode to maximize fuel economy and an Off-Road mode that changes the system’s responses and raises the body to its maximum ride height. E-Active Body Control can also do something unique — a special feature called Free Driving mode can get you unstuck from deep sand, should you find yourself driving through a desert or onto a beach, by “jumping” the body up and down while applying the traction control. No word yet on whether or not this works in deep snow, but we suspect it doesn’t due to the different friction qualities of snow and sand. \n\nThe only low point of the GLE’s driving experience is that the brake-pedal feel is less than inspiring, with a mushy initial bite and a greater effort than expected to bleed off speed. The GLE350 feels a little bit better than the 450 in this area, which I suspect may be due to the 350’s lower weight. This is the only blemish on what is otherwise a superbly luxurious driving experience — but note that I do not say a sporty or entertaining one. The GLE is decidedly geared toward comfort and isolation, but it never embarrasses itself in the twisty bits. It’s competent, confident and satisfying to drive but never gets to be entertaining. For that, you’ll have to visit a BMW showroom and sample the all-new X5.\n\nLuxury Accommodations, Now More Spacious\n\nThe first-generation ML crossovers weren’t lauded for their luxurious interior trappings — a criticism that will never befall this latest GLE. Mercedes-Benz has been crafting some impressive interiors as of late, using the idea of trickling down the top-of-the-line S-Class flagship’s materials and designs to lesser models, and the GLE continues that tradition. The materials, fit, finish, control knobs and buttons all shame most of the competition, even on the base GLE350. Step up to the 450 and start specifying some of the more unusual trim choices, and you’ll be rewarded with an interior that is beautiful, functional and flawlessly assembled.  \n\nIt’s also bigger than before thanks to a wheelbase stretched by more than 3 inches, almost all of which went to backseat legroom. It has also enabled an optional third row to be offered, best suited for children despite Mercedes-Benz’s assurances that it’s comfortable for anyone 5-foot, 11-inches tall or less. The second row’s legroom has been boosted considerably, and it’s now a very comfortable place to be even with doors that seem to intrude on cabin width rather significantly. Unlike other luxury vehicles, materials quality does not fall off from the front seat to the rear; it’s just as nice in the second row as it is up front.\n\nTechnology, to the Point of Overload\n\nMercedes-Benz has packed the new GLE with the latest and greatest tech — and it will take some acclimation before you can use it smoothly and with minimal distraction. Front and center is the new MBUX multimedia system (that’s “Emm-Bee-You-Ecks,” not “Emm-Bucks,”), which now employs a touchscreen. Combined with the fully digital gauge cluster, the GLE presents an electronic cockpit that spans much of the width of the dashboard. MBUX is extraordinary for a couple of reasons, the first of which is the augmented reality function in the navigation system. Switch it on while navigation is guiding you, and as you approach turns, the screen switches to a front camera view with arrows, street names, house numbers and more superimposed, in real time, into the image. It helps you to determine exactly where to turn, where the house you’re looking for is and more. It’s a little distracting, as you’re watching the screen instead of what’s in front of you, but it’s still an astonishing bit of tech.\n\nRelated: Hey, Mercedes! Voice-Activated Assistant Drives New MBUX System\n\nThe MBUX system also has introduced “Hey Mercedes,” a voice-activated concierge along the lines of Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. Say the words “Hey Mercedes” and tell it what you want it to do — anything from adding a waypoint to your active navigation to looking something up on the web. It works quite well but has a specific flaw: Anytime you say the word Mercedes, such as talking about the car, or say something that sounds similar to it, the system activates, requiring you to cancel it. You’ll find yourself chatting with your passengers very carefully, being extra cautious not to say anything that sounds too similar to “Mercedes,” lest you wake the beast again and have to deal with an annoying, unwanted concierge activation. \n\nAlso impressive is the configurability of the gauge cluster, now with four possible options and the ability to choose what information is displayed on which side of the cluster, and in what combination. It features far more customizability than prior versions of Mercedes-Benz’s digital dash, and it augments the optional head-up display, now expanded to a massive 17.8-inch by 5.9-inch, super-bright, highly customizable form. \n\nThe problem with all of this high-tech wizardry is that it can be overwhelming and distracting, especially when trying to first familiarize yourself with it all. Most owners will likely spend time learning how to use some of the features, set things how they want them and never touch the configurable features again, such as the variable color of the interior ambient lighting. There’s a learning curve to figuring out the GLE’s technology, and it’s not an easy slope; it will require some study and dedicated practice, as any new technology generally does. \n\nThe New Benchmark?\n\nTaken as a whole, even with the complicated technology and lackluster brakes, the new GLE is an extremely impressive new model. Its beautifully executed interior sets the stage, but the driving experience nails it home. While pricing has yet to be announced, Mercedes-Benz may have just set the new segment benchmark for luxury SUVs.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Offering the solidity and solitude of a bank vault, the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 mid-size SUV embodies the brand’s classic definition of luxury, but with a modern suite of tech features.\n\nVersus the competition: The GLE450 isn’t trying to be a BMW; it eschews infusing sporty driving dynamics into an SUV package in favor of a more comfort-focused outlook, which has served Mercedes well for decades.\n\nThe GLE-Class is Mercedes’ bestselling vehicle. A mid-size SUV with two or three rows, seating five or seven, it received some minor exterior and interior updates for the 2024 model year, as well as a new plug-in hybrid version: the GLE450e.\n\nRelated: Facelifted 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE SUV Priced From $63,800, Coupe From $90,950\n\nYou can read our review of the new GLE450e here; this review covers the regular GLE450, which is powered by the mid-level gas engine in the GLE lineup: a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology. The engine is rated at 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, and it works with a nine-speed automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels via standard 4Matic all-wheel drive. The GLE450 starts at $70,650, including a $1,150 destination charge, but a long list of individual options and packages raised the price of our test vehicle considerably: Its as-tested price was $97,505.\n\nStill Looks Like a GLE\n\nThe smooth lines of the traditionally shaped GLE450 SUV haven’t changed for 2024, and most of what’s new is concentrated at the front and rear of the vehicle. The grille, front bumper, headlights and taillights see styling tweaks that freshen the SUV’s look without taking its design aesthetic in a different direction.\n\nA number of our test vehicle’s options were visible on its exterior, including Manufaktur Cardinal Red Metallic paint ($1,750), a body-colored roof spoiler ($685), 21-inch five-spoke AMG wheels ($1,100), a trailer-hitch receiver ($600), an AMG Line Exterior Package ($3,150) and a Night Package with black exterior accents ($400). The AMG Line Exterior gives the SUV AMG-style design cues, including a unique grille, body-colored wheel-arch trim and a rear diffuser-style treatment. Look closely and you’ll see that the grille insert is made up of numerous three-pointed stars — a cool touch. I could have done without the SUV’s $650 illuminated brushed-aluminum running boards, which aren’t wide enough to be of much use; be careful when stepping over them or your pant leg is likely to brush against them.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe GLE450 is a comfortable highway cruiser, and its focus on occupant isolation makes for a relaxing driving experience. The SUV steers with a light touch, and the drivetrain responds quickly with a part-throttle kickdown when you need to make a move around traffic. The cabin is sufficiently hushed, and like the brand’s flagship S-Class sedan, the GLE450 feels solid and substantial rather than sporty and sprite. Our test vehicle’s $1,100 Acoustic Comfort Package likely contributed to the SUV’s exceptional isolation; the package includes additional sound-deadening material and an acoustic membrane for the windows.\n\nThe GLE450’s ride quality is an interesting mix of cushiness and firmness. Our test vehicle had an optional Airmatic adaptive air suspension, which costs $1,710, and it gave the GLE the type of isolated floatiness that is the usual calling card of air suspensions.\n\nIt’s a good thing the GLE had this suspension setup, because it saved it from the wheel-and-tire package: The 21-inch AMG wheels on our test car were staggered with wider rubber at the rear. The tires are relatively low-profile, with 45-series tires in front and 40-series tires in back, and the result was firm impact responses when traveling on bumpier stretches of pavement or over utility covers; we definitely felt them in the GLE450’s otherwise isolating cabin. The tires on our test vehicle were set at the vehicle’s maximum load rating — 38 psi for the fronts and 44 psi for the rears — and it’s likely that running them at the normal load range of 31 psi front and rear would soften those impacts a bit.\n\nInterior Blends Traditional and Modern Cues\n\nOur test vehicle’s optional black-and-beige interior with leather upholstery is one of two new color combinations for the GLE, and it’s a $1,620 option. Combined with the optional piano-black wood trim ($850), the cabin was an inviting space, with the type of high-grade materials that have long defined luxury vehicles. The influence of modern technology, however, is also clearly visible in the interior.\n\nIt starts right in front of you, where dual 12.3-inch screens for the digital instrument panel and infotainment system are positioned side by side on the dashboard. The displays are crisp, clear and bright, and the center touchscreen’s menus are easy to navigate. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto gain wireless connectivity for 2024, and wireless CarPlay was easy to set up and worked well with my iPhone.\n\nNot every function has been integrated into the touchscreen; Mercedes smartly includes a strip of physical climate controls below the center air vents, as well as a group of controls — including a volume roller — around the center console touchpad. The 2024 GLE’s new steering wheel has touch-sensitive controls that are reasonably easy to use, but I still prefer the more predictable responses of traditional buttons for the steering wheel.\n\nThe gear selector stalk on the steering column is easy to use, but it doesn’t free up as much storage space on the center console as you might expect. The touchpad that serves as an alternate user interface for the infotainment system takes up a lot of the available space, leaving room for a couple of cupholders and a wireless charging pad in front of it. Behind it is a smaller storage bin under the front center armrest.\n\nThe backseat in the two-row GLE450 is positioned close to the floor, which makes for a somewhat knees-up seating position. There’s plenty of headroom for adults, but the backrest doesn’t recline, which seems like an oversight. The seat does fold flat with the cargo floor when you need extra space, and the cargo area behind the backseat is sizable; Mercedes says it’s 33 cubic feet. You can also lower the rear portion of the air suspension via a switch in the cargo area to make loading and unloading easier.\n\nA Pricey Proposition\n\nWith a price tag of nearly $100,000, our test GLE450 was indeed expensive — more than you’d spend for a well-optioned BMW X5 or Audi Q7. It’s not unusual, however, for a car with the three-pointed star on its grille to carry a price premium — though whether you believe it’s worth the premium is another matter. What’s not in question, however, is that the GLE450 offers a truly luxurious driving experience in a practical SUV package.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE450e Review: The Shallow End of the EV Pool\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE Gains PHEV, Off-Road Tech\nMercedes-Benz Recalls 116,000 GLE, GLS SUVs Over Fire Risk\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S Coupe: Will It Track?

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE delivers the power and luxury you expect from a vehicle sporting the three-pointed star emblem. Available in traditional SUV or Coupe format, the latter features a truncated tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design. The standard engine is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder, which is fitted to the front- or all-wheel-drive GLE350; a 362-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, and a 504-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. Both the 450 and 580 are equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems and come standard with AWD. But wait, there are also two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and 603-hp AMG GLE63S. With so many permutations, the GLE’s competition is varied and includes the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe 2023 GLE gets new metallic paint colors but is otherwise unchanged. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nMBUX voice recognition\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHands-free power liftgate\nHands-free park assist\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nBlind spot warning system\nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin air fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests \nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad sign recognition\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options. Even in its base format, though, the GLE is elegantly appointed, and the 255-hp turbo four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. When venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, of course: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual.",

      "expert_review": "The GLE Coupe is the less practical, more stylish twin to Mercedes-Benz’s mid-size GLE SUV, with a fastback roofline that trades rear-seat and cargo space for a dramatic profile. Prior to the 2025 model year, Mercedes-Benz was so confident that buyers of the coupe were committed to sport that it only offered the model in two AMG trims. New for 2025 is a non-AMG entry-level trim, the GLE450 4Matic; it costs around $15,000 less than the AMG GLE53 and starts at $77,550 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S Coupe: Will It Track? Should It Track?\n\nWhile the GLE450 doesn’t have an AMG engine beneath its hood, it does sport a standard AMG exterior styling package and 20-inch AMG wheels. Numerous new paint and upholstery options for all three trim levels ensure that buyers can spec their GLE Coupe exactly how they want.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nGLE450 4Matic: $77,550\nAMG GLE53: $93,300\nAMG GLE63 S: $133,300\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe new GLE450 4Matic might be the new entry-level variant, but it is far from basic. It squats on adaptive dampers and 20-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 64-color ambient lighting and a power tilt/telescoping steering column. Standard tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nIn addition to its base composition, the GLE450 is available in two trim packages. The $1,300 Exclusive Trim Package includes ventilated front seats and a 13-speaker Burmester sound system. To that, the Pinnacle Trim adds upgraded LED headlights, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, a fragrance diffuser, a head-up display, heated and cooled front cupholders, gesture controls and animated Mercedes-logo puddle lamps for $5,300.\n\nDespite the $50,000-plus window in their base prices, every 2025 GLE Coupe includes the same standard driver-assistance technologies. The suite includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver attention monitor, a 360-degree parking camera, automated parking and automatic high beams.\n\nThe AMG GLE53 rides on 21-inch wheels and a sport suspension with air springs and adaptive dampers; it also gets upgraded brakes and headlights, a performance exhaust, augmented-reality navigation and the contents of the Exclusive Trim Package. Here, the Pinnacle Trim Package costs just $3,300 since some of its content is already standard.\n\nThere are no trim packages available on the AMG GLE63 S, as all of the Pinnacle equipment is standard. Also included are 22-inch wheels, larger brakes, active anti-roll bars, an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential, dynamic engine mounts, heated windshield washers, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is optional on all three variants and costs $1,950. It bundles adaptive cruise control, emergency steering assist, front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, lane-centering steering, lane change assist, traffic jam assist and road-sign recognition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 Review: Solitude Over Sportiness\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nIs the Mercedes-AMG GLE53 a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like and 3 We Don’t\nResearch Mercedes-Benz\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe GLE450 4Matic is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine with 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. A turbo 3.0-liter inline-six also powers the AMG GLE53, but it generates 429 hp and 413 pounds-feet, which Mercedes claims is good for a 4.9-second sprint from 0-60 mph, an improvement of 0.4 second over the GLE450 4Matic. At the top of the GLE Coupe food chain is the AMG GLE63 S. It boasts a 603-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 627 pounds-feet of torque and rockets to 60 mph in a claimed 3.7 seconds.\n\nAll three engines are paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard 4Matic all-wheel drive. The AMGs get the upgraded 4Matic+, which is capable of quicker torque delivery to the front and rear wheels and can send up to 100% of the power to the rear axle.\n\nThe 2025 GLE450 returns an EPA-rated 19/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The AMG GLE53 is rated at 18/22/20 mpg and the AMG GLE63 at 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
