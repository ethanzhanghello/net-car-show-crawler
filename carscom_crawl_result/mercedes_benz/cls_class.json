      "expert_review": "As Mercedes-Benz rolls out sporty AMG editions of each of its products, the company’s in-house performance group seems to put a different spin on every model. The 2006 CLS55 AMG coupe is no exception.\n\nThe AMG treatment does not come cheaply, and not all consumers believe the AMG brand is worth the hefty premium.\n\nOur test model, equipped with only a single $3,900 option package, had a bottom line of $92,975.\n\nHE: I was a big fan of the AMG tuning house long before Mercedes bought them and brought them inside, and the company’s strategy of offering AMG versions of all their vehicles seems like a brilliant move, especially here in the States where the Mercedes brand has never been seen as a true competitor to BMW in the performance arena. Cars like the CLS55 AMG are really helping to change consumers’ perception of Mercedes — especially their performance capability — in a very positive way. And you can count me as a booster; this car is highly entertaining, if you’re one of the lucky few who can afford the whopping sticker.\n\nSHE: This car is highly ridiculous. It makes me think of our neighbor Mike, the biology prof, who recently lectured me on the fact that men’s DNA is set up so most of them are genetically programmed to look at women and cars. I’m sorry, but I don’t get the AMG brand at all. It means nothing to me. And the car seemed overly masculine — too black and monochromatic. I’m surprised it doesn’t come with a standard jockstrap.\n\nHE: Speaking of too shallow, I suppose you missed all the nice refinements and luxury touches, from the matte-finish burl-walnut trim and suede headliner to those heavenly “dynamic” seats that massage your tired muscles on long drives. And can you really tell me with a straight face that a supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 469 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque doesn’t stir your blood when you put your foot to the floor?\n\nSHE: No, what stirs my blood is a completely paid-off credit card with no spending limit. On a purely practical level, this CLS55 AMG gets only 14 miles per gallon in city driving. It takes premium fuel only, which is now running around $3.50 a gallon. Plus, it has a $1,700 gas guzzler tax. Andit’s relatively costly to insure. Yes, it has excellent safety features, including side curtain air bags. But I can get those on a Kia.\n\nHE: We’re talking about a whole different level of performance here, and for that, you’d be amazed at how many people are willing to pay the premium. And if they can afford a $90,000 automobile, chances are the guzzler tax and high fuel prices will be no deterrent. I have a few of my own specific issues with the CLS55 AMG, including the fact that the rear seats don’t have nearly enough head or leg room for six-footers, despite the fact that the front seatbacks are scooped out. The controls on these fancy German cars are also getting outrageously complicated — so much so that they start to become a hazardous distraction while you’re driving.\n\nSHE: I do feel like we were talking past each other on this one. But I think if Mercedes is hoping to draw women into the AMG brand, they should do a better job of educating us and convincing us why we should care about it. Maybe if I saw it in Oprah’s magazine, on her list of favorite things, I’d be more convinced. But at this point, I just think it’s another one of those pointless “guy” cars that just isn’t worth the money.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG touts a 5.4-liter, 469- horsepower engine and a luxurious interior that is befitting its $90,000 price tag.\n\n2006 Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, four-passenger coupe.\n\nPrice: Base, $89,075 (inc. $775 shipping charge and $1,700 gas guzzler tax); as tested, $92,975.\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter V-8; 469-hp; 516 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 mpg city/20 mpg highway.\n\nWhere built: Germany\n\nEstimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $2,761\n\nAnita\n\nRating: 3\n\nLikes: Fantastic safety features. High assembly quality inside and out. Comfortable ride, not overly harsh. High-tech four-zone automatic climate control. Excellent warranty, plus 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nDislikes: Way too pricy, even for a Mercedes. Ridiculous $1,700 gas guzzler tax. AMG brand means nothing to me. Overly masculine — too black/monochromatic. Takes premium fuel only — at well over $3 a gallon. Do I really want a luxury car with “ground effects”?\n\nPaul\n\nRating: 5\n\nLikes: Supremely comfortable “dynamic” seats (part of a $3,900 option package). Satin-finish wood and suede headliner are classy touches. Powerful supercharged 5.4L V-8 has muscle to spare. Great handling.\n\nDislikes: Lousy fuel economy. Not enough rear leg or head room, despite the scooped-out front seatbacks Complicated controls and switches.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benz is adding safety and power to its CLS — the sedan it says looks like a coupe. The automaker’s Pre-Safe system, which reacts to a collision and adjusts the interior to protect its occupants, is now standard across all CLS models.\n\nThe power comes in the form of bigger engines for the CLS500 and CLS55 AMG, now known as the CLS550 and CLS63 AMG. Beneath the hood of the CLS550 is a V-8 rated at 382 horsepower. Stepping up a notch, the CLS63 AMG features a 507-hp, 5.5-liter V-8.\n\nThe CLS550 includes such features as Airmatic DC air suspension and four-zone climate control for comfort levels comparable to the automaker’s S-Class sedan. Safety features include adaptive front airbags, side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nExterior\nDubbed a four-door coupe, the CLS-Class was derived from a coupe study that appeared at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. It features a high belt line and short side glass. A distinctive body crease rises from the front wheel arch, extends across the bodyside and continues through the contoured rear light cluster into the back bumper.\n\nThe roofline forms a sweeping arc above the body before smoothly transitioning into the C-pillar, which appears pulled toward the rear of the car. Aluminum is used for the front and rear subframes, parcel shelf and other components. The car has a coefficient of drag of 0.30.\n\nBuilt on a 112.4-inch wheelbase, the CLS-Class is slightly more than 193 inches long overall and nearly 74 inches wide.\n\nProjector-type headlights are standard, and bi-xenon headlights are optional. An automatic cornering light function with the bi-xenon units switches on the cornering lights during a turn, and the adaptive headlights pivot to follow the driver’s steering movements.\n\nInterior\nUp to four occupants can fit inside the CLS-Class. The instrument panel’s central speedometer is flanked by a tachometer and clock. Black dials have chrome surrounds. Bar-chart displays show the fuel level and coolant temperature.\n\nThe four-door layout of the CLS-Class permits easy entry and exit. Power front seats are standard and may be equipped with optional active ventilation. Massaging front seats are also optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe CLS550 gets a 382-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The CLS63 AMG has a 507-hp supercharged V-8 that’s connected to a five-speed automatic transmission. Both transmissions have manual-shift provisions.\n\nSafety\nMercedes’ Pre-Safe system is standard. The system pre-tensions seat belts, moves the seats into a safer position and closes the sunroof if it senses an impending collision. Electronic Stability Program, antilock brakes, front and rear side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThis CLS sedan doesn’t look like a typical Mercedes-Benz. Relatively light steering detracts from the sporty feel even though handling capabilities rank high. This is a big car, yet it maneuvers like a smaller model.\n\nThe automaker’s mighty V-8 delivers plenty of power in a wholly refined and civilized manner. Shifts are more noticeable in the CLS than in some other luxury automobiles, but they’re reasonably crisp and quick. However, the automatic transmission’s operation tends to be intrusive while braking; it sometimes feels like an anchor ratcheting you down yet another notch. Occasional downshifts get awkward when rolling to a halt — and more so if you then step on the gas.\n\nExpect a comfortable ride in the true luxury sense. The suspension might be taut, but its operation is largely concealed as you drive on smooth surfaces. On the downside, backseat headroom is scant, though legroom and foot space suffice. Getting into the backseat is difficult.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2007, Mercedes-Benz added safety and power to its CLS — the sedan it says looks like a coupe. This model year, there are a few more standard options, including satellite radio and larger wheels. CLS-Class models include the CLS550 and CLS63 AMG. CLS models compete in the same market segment as the Audi A8, BMW 550 and Jaguar S-Type.\n\nBeneath the hood of the CLS550 is a V-8 rated at 382 horsepower. Stepping up a notch, the CLS63 AMG features a 507-hp, 5.5-liter V-8.\n\nThe CLS550 includes such features as Airmatic DC air suspension and four-zone climate control for comfort levels comparable to the automaker’s S-Class sedan. Safety features include adaptive front airbags, side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nExterior\nNew standard equipment for 2008 includes seven-spoke 18-inch wheels. Dubbed a four-door coupe, the CLS-Class was derived from a coupe study that appeared at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. It features a high belt line and short side glass. A distinctive body crease rises from the front wheel arch, extends across the bodyside and continues through the contoured rear light cluster into the back bumper.\n\nThe roofline forms a sweeping arc above the body before smoothly transitioning into the C-pillar, which appears pulled toward the rear of the car. Aluminum is used for the front and rear subframes, parcel shelf and other components.\n\nBuilt on a 112.4-inch wheelbase, the CLS-Class is slightly more than 193 inches long overall and nearly 74 inches wide.\n\nProjector-type headlights are standard, and bi-xenon headlights are optional. An automatic cornering light function with the bi-xenon units switches on the cornering lights during a turn, and the adaptive headlights pivot to follow the driver’s steering movements.\n\nInterior\nUp to four occupants can fit inside the CLS-Class. The instrument panel’s central speedometer is flanked by a tachometer and clock. Black dials have chrome surrounds. Bar-chart displays show the fuel level and coolant temperature.\n\nThe four-door layout of the CLS-Class permits easy entry and exit. Power front seats are standard and may be equipped with optional active ventilation. Massaging front seats are also optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe CLS550 gets a 382-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that works with a seven-speed automatic transmission. The CLS63 AMG has a 507-hp supercharged V-8 that’s connected to a five-speed automatic transmission. Both transmissions have manual-shift provisions.\n\nSafety\nMercedes’ Pre-Safe system is standard. The system pre-tensions seat belts, moves the seats into a safer position and closes the sunroof if it senses an impending collision. An electronic stability system, antilock brakes, front and rear side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThis CLS sedan doesn’t look like a typical Mercedes-Benz. Relatively light steering detracts from the sporty feel even though handling capabilities rank high. This is a big car, yet it maneuvers like a smaller model.\n\nThe automaker’s mighty V-8 delivers plenty of power in a wholly refined and civilized manner. Shifts are more noticeable in the CLS than in some other luxury automobiles, but they’re reasonably crisp and quick. However, the automatic transmission’s operation tends to be intrusive while braking; it sometimes feels like an anchor ratcheting you down yet another notch. Occasional downshifts get awkward when rolling to a halt — and more so if you then step on the gas.\n\nExpect a comfortable ride in the true luxury sense. The suspension might be taut, but its operation is largely concealed as you drive on smooth surfaces. On the downside, backseat headroom is scant, though legroom and foot space suffice. Getting into the backseat is difficult.",

The bounce of concrete seams along Interstate 94 are smoothed out by a setting the Airmatic suspension on comfort. Only the cackle of the Escort radar detector announcing another possible Ka-band encroachment or POP by “The Man” ruffled our feathers.\n\nBut it’s tough to get riled when sitting in such plush leather bucket seats. While we never saw a flashing red light in our rear view mirror, if we needed to stay cool, we could have turned on the ventilated seats for some fresh backside air.\n\nThis car, which starts at $94,550, turns the fast lane into slow motion. While heavy (just over 4,200 pounds), the CLS 63 AMG feels well weighted on the road. The steering is firm but not twitchy. The 6.2-liter V-8 rumbles but never roars, though it packs more than 500 horses under its hood. It’s refined in every way. Even the seven-speed automatic transmission is silky smooth as it clicks through the gears to hit 60 mph from a standstill in 4.3 seconds.\n\nBut all of that power is hidden under curvy sheet metal and a sloping roof that is as graceful as a marble sculpture.\n\nParked at a gas station outside of Paw Paw, the CLS 63 AMG looked out of place as 20-year-old pickups cruised past. This vehicle is sleek and sophisticated. It carries spies to embassy parties, not a couple of reporters to Joliet. The CLS 63 AMG is ferocity in a tuxedo.\n\nAnd really, it does most of the driving. Hop in, set the radar-based adaptive cruise control and enjoy the ride. The cruise control system, known as Distronic Plus, does everything but steer. It tracks cars around you, maintains your speed and distance from other vehicles and applies the brakes or accelerator as needed. It’s as close to auto pilot as you can get in a vehicle without hiring a chauffer. If you follow a car off the highway onto the exit ramp, the CLS 63 AMG will bring you to a full stop and never ask you to touch the brake pedal. I’ve used these kinds of cruise controls before, and it’s unnerving and exhilarating at the same time.\n\nWith most of the driving done by the vehicle, I found extra time to figure out how to use the iPod connector in the glove box. In the past, some car makers put the auxiliary jack in the glove box, which didn’t make much sense because you needed the music player to select songs. Now, Mercedes lets you control your iPod on the push button screen in the center of the leather-covered dash. While connected to the car, the iPod also recharges. The only function I couldn’t do was select a shuffle mode on the iPod, but other than that every thing else worked fine.\n\nThe Harman/Kardon Logic 7 digital surround sound system used all 480 watts and 12 speakers to play songs with distinct clarity. You could hear every raspy vibrato of Mark Knopfler singing about the demise of “Telegraph Road” — a fantastic cruising song. The stereo turns the cabin into a sound stage; a very comfortable one at that.\n\nBy creating a four-door coupe (which I think is like having a two-wheel unicycle), Mercedes is trying to give you all of the performance of a coupe and the comfort of a sedan. The company’s press materials even say the CLS 63 AMG is a “coupe-like car that boasts the comfort and convenience of four doors.” Maybe they should just call it a saloon.\n\nEither way, the second row, which resembles two more bucket seats with a nicely laid out center console, is generous with space.\n\nAnother thing I liked was driving this Mercedes at night. The instrument panel is easy on your eyes so you can stay alert on the road. The blue and white lighting never distracts you. Every person, no matter what car you’re considering, should test drive the vehicle at night before buying it. A car can transform into an unfamiliar place under the moon.\n\nThe best part of driving the CLS 63 AMG is when you look around the highway, you know you have the fastest car. It doesn’t mean you have to flex your muscle, but if you wanted to, you could. Mercedes even offers an option package that raises the electronically limited top speed from 155 mph to 186 mph. So, if you see another CLS 63 AMG, you’ll have a faster one.\n\nThe only thing you won’t be able to out run is a state trooper’s radio, unless, of course, you have an escort.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "As I approached the all-new 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, I was filled with a mix of elation and bona-fide terror. It’s similar to when you walk into a very nice home and the first thing you say to your children is, “Don’t touch anything!” The CLS550 is so luxurious and well-equipped that it’s easy to get intimidated by it, especially with kids in tow. Add in the twin-turbo V-8 engine and you may be a little spooked, but you won’t be spooked for long.\n\nYou may have to endure some teasing and raised eyebrows as you proclaim the seemingly impractical 2012 Mercedes CLS550 a fantastic family car, but just as some women spend their nine months of pregnancy in stilettos without even flinching, the CLS550 performs well in this role.\n\nWith a surprising amount of cabin space and storage along with luxury features that end up being incredibly convenient for passengers big or small, the CLS-Class can do your family right — if you can afford it. Oh, and you should also be willing to sacrifice some function for form and not have a need to transport more than four people at a time, either. Buyers beware: The CLS550 is quite a seductress, and it does have the ability to distort your priorities (Yes, I do need a massaging driver’s seat!). It also makes a convincing case as a way to transport your family while integrating your desires for power, safety and style all into one amazing package.\n\nDriving a CLS550 is thrilling. Its V-8 engine is beefy, but it doesn’t roar like a muscle car. It’s fast but smooth, handles beautifully and never leaves you feeling unsafe behind the wheel. In tight corners, the active seat bolsters wrap around you to keep you from sliding in your seat, and if you want to feel even more adventurous, there’s the option of switching to Sport mode to really take things up a notch. If you’d rather revel in its luxury, you can use Mercedes-Benz’s Distronic Plus technology, which is more than just a cruise control feature; it will accelerate and brake for you, maintaining a safe distance between you and the car ahead.\n\nThe 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 starts at $71,300. My test car, which had all-wheel drive, was priced at $84,875.\n\nEXTERIOR\nFrom the outside, the CLS550 is a knockout. I lost count of how many times the word “stunning” was used when people saw my family and I pull up in it. Called a “four-door coupe,” it’s got all the sportiness of a two-door car minus most of the hassles. The long hood and giant grille can come off a little menacing, but its gorgeous sculpted frame and sleek rear end balance things out to make the CLS a top choice for anyone with a penchant for style.\n\nWhat’s controversial about the CLS550 is its low-slung body and roof height. It plays a big part in why the car looks so great, but it’s a deal-breaker for some. My family is on the short side so it didn’t bother us, and I was so enamored with the exterior design that I didn’t mind taking extra care when getting the baby in and out of her child-safety seat. For those less enamored with the CLS550’s looks, ducking to enter the vehicle will be a drag, and you’ll most likely get a few complaints from those who are a little less limber. However, the silver lining here is the low step-in height definitely makes entries and exits easy for the kiddos.\n\nThe trunk’s family friendliness is also subjective. I found it to be cavernous for a sedan. It fit my stroller, portable crib, plus my workout gear and grocery bags, so I had no complaints. However, my husband seemed irritated by it. Due to the ultra-sleek styling, the cargo area tapers toward the back. He found the trunk opening and height to be too shallow. Everything fit in it, though, which was all that mattered to me.\n\nUnder the hood, you’ll find an eye-popping 402-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 engine. With those kinds of specs, there may be a few fights over who gets the keys. At first, I thought this much power was excessive, but Mercedes managed to tame this monster to make it less daredevil and more refined. For such a beefy engine, its EPA-estimated 16/25 mpg city/highway was a surprise. I averaged just about 18 mpg for the week. You do need to keep up with appearances at the pump, though — the CLS550 requires premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nIn stark contrast to the fresh, forward-thinking exterior styling, the CLS550’s interior comes off as stodgy and conservative. Frankly, it’s got quite the boys-club feel inside. No luxury has been overlooked inside the CLS550’s cabin. Allow me to gush about a few of its most hedonistic features: available heated and cooled leather seats, a massaging driver’s seat and active seat bolsters that automatically adjust to “hug” you and prevent you from sliding in your seat as you turn a corner. All I needed was a robot under the dash painting my toenails and it would be a spa on wheels.\n\nThe CLS does have more down-to-earth features that can make it a great family car. First, the cabin is roomy, and whether transporting infants in rear-facing seats or adults, everybody’s got ample personal space in front or back. There’s also a generous storage-to-passenger ratio. Along with the usual storage spaces, there’s a sizable covered storage bin in back that was perfect for hiding all my daughter’s toys, and in front of it there are cupholders. Underneath the front seats there’s concealed storage that can stash a small purse.\n\nThe CLS-Class only seats two in the backseat. The front row’s center console flows into the rear seats and acts as a barrier between them. It could lessen the “Mom, he’s touching me!” battles on long trips. My favorite surprise feature was an optional power sunshade for the rear window. It eliminates the beating sun on those poor rear-facing infants and toddlers.\n\nMercedes-Benz definitely delivers when it comes to its luxury features that help make the CLS550 an absolute dream to drive. However, its multimedia system has a learning curve and I was underwhelmed by its antiquated displays. Controlling functions via the knob in the front row’s center console wasn’t exactly intuitive.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe CLS550’s two sets of lower Latch anchors make child-safety seat installation a piece of cake. There’s no searching or digging for the anchors since they sit out in the open. Just flip the rubber cover and easily attach the restraint to the Latch anchor. If every car had a Latch system like this, our world would instantly be free of an astounding amount of aggravation and despair. Rear- and forward-facing car seats fit well in the CLS.\n\nThe 2012 CLS550 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe CLS has standard rear-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and 10 airbags, including knee airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows. Also standard are Mercedes’ Pre-Safe system, which closes the sunroof and windows, tightens seat belts and adjusts seats to their safest positions if the car senses that there’s about to be a collision, and Attention Assist, a driver-drowsiness monitor.\n\nOptional safety features include all-wheel drive, rear-seat side-impact airbags, adaptive headlights, a blind spot monitoring system and a lane departure warning system. Distronic Plus, also known as adaptive cruise control, brakes and accelerates the car to maintain a safe distance between you and the car ahead.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2011 about the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf style is important to luxury shoppers, the 2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class has the upper hand over other sedans on the market.\n\nThe radically shaped four-door — it’s sometimes called a coupe because of its sporty roofline, and because there are just two seats in back — has been redesigned for 2012, and it looks terrific in its new skin.\n\nThe original CLS was no slouch, either; it set the auto world aflutter with its style, but it was hard to see out of, and it had a cramped interior and didn’t offer enough performance to satisfy shoppers. Not surprisingly, its success waned quickly.\n\nThe 2012 has better visibility, tremendous performance chops — especially the AMG model — and when you compare its interior room with the traditional Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan’s, it barely gives an inch.\n\nThere’s a price to pay for these improvements, though: $10,000 when you compare it with an E550 sedan.\n\nStyle\nThere are just two elements that could account for that price difference: The CLS’ more advanced V-8 engine and its darn appealing, elegant design. Like most new Benzes, the CLS features a large, dominant grille, in this case embedded with a gigantic three-pointed star. And of course there are optional full LED headlights. Luxury automakers are in a war to see which can use more LEDs to illuminate our roads, and the CLS comes to the fight with two stories of LED strips in the headlight cluster — to great effect.\n\nThe CLS’ design trademark is the sloping roofline that many other vehicles have emulated over the years. For 2012, the car allows for a more traditional profile, albeit one dressed up with scallops running along the doors. It then radically drops off in the rear in a rounded truncation.\n\nIt’s a startling effect, set off with giant taillights, yet whenever I try to describe it I end up using the word “droopy.”\n\nThe CLS63 AMG has larger, 19-inch wheels, a more aggressive front bumper, a chin spoiler and quad exhaust.\n\nPerformance\nUnlike most Mercedes, there is no V-6 option for the CLS. The model range starts with the CLS550 and ends with the CLS63 AMG, with nothing in between. That means you have the choice of either a 402-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.6-liter V-8 that bursts up highway on-ramps with aplomb, or a 518-hp, twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 that can blow the doors off most muscle cars revving at a stoplight.\n\nThe CLS550 has enough power to satisfy most drivers. It’s so close to BMW’s new twin-turbo V-8 in terms of real-world response that I don’t think either company has an edge under the hood. However, the CLS has a nasty habit of lagging when taking off from a dead stop. All the Cars.com editors who tested the 550 bemoaned this attribute. I drove it the most and learned to massage the accelerator pedal just right to overcome most of the lag, but it’s hard to pay that much attention all the time.\n\nThe E550 features the same V-8 for 2012, but its lack of crisp handling is what might lead more buyers toward the CLS. The CLS may not handle like a sports car, but its steering is precise when taking twisty roads at speed, yet it isn’t overly heavy for long highway slogs.\n\nThe ride is also surprisingly livable, making the CLS550 nearly as viable a daily driver as an E-Class. The base CLS comes with rear-wheel drive, while the E550 has all-wheel drive standard.\n\nCLS63 AMG\nEven more surprising is the fact that the high-performance AMG is a pretty good daily driver, too … considering it has 116 more horsepower, a firmer suspension, tighter steering and loud exhaust. Those are all things an AMG buyer will want, though, and at $94,900, the performance for the money is almost a bargain.\n\nThe AMG V-8 transforms the CLS into a burly performance car that launches from the line with a grunt from the engine, a snort of exhaust and a whole lot of exhilaration. Cornering is delightful, and the steering is even more precise than the 550’s.\n\nAn adaptive suspension adjusts for comfortable cruising or performance driving, delivering a more rigid ride in Sport mode.\n\nThe 2011 E63 AMG returns the same horsepower ratings, but its engine is a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V-8. (Mercedes liberally uses 63 in the model name anyway.) The E63 AMG gets to 60 mph in an estimated 4.3 seconds, while the CLS63 AMG does it in 4.4 seconds or 4.3 with a performance package. That means once you throw on the AMG extras the E-Class and CLS-Class are much more alike than the E550 and CLS550. We’ll see how similar the 2012 E63 AMG is once it’s released later this year featuring the same turbocharged powerplant as the 2012 CLS.\n\nInterior\nShoppers will see few differences in the CLS versus the rest of the Mercedes lineup, though I felt it was a step up from the E-Class and a step below the CL-Class, which is appropriate given all those cars’ starting prices.\n\nThe seats are comfortable up front. Headroom is a bit limited, but there was plenty for me at 5-foot-10.\n\nThe CLS AMG surprised us by having a major difference in its controls versus the CLS550: While the shifter stalk is attached to the steering column in the 550, the CLS63 AMG’s is in the center console, which is a much more common placement.\n\nNot only that, but also the shifter is a cool-looking design of sculpted metal and leather.\n\nMy CLS550 had an all-black interior that was more conservative than the light gray leather the CLS63 AMG sported. While I wouldn’t normally recommend such a light color, as it shows dirt as vividly as a piece of evidence glows under a black light on “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” this application was so stylish I’d make an exception.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the new CLS to me is that it doesn’t feel as cramped as the previous version. The rear seat isn’t too uncomfortable, either, compared with other luxury sedans in this class. Look at the specs, and the CLS and E have nearly identical rear seat dimensions. The CLS feels more claustrophobic, sure, but that’s mostly due to the smaller windows.\n\nI had both my children in their child-safety seats in the back, and they fit just fine. (Talk about easy Latch anchors to use …) While most CLS owners likely aren’t young parents, those bulky safety seats serve as a barometer for overall roominess. As noted, there is no center seat in back; rather, there are large cargo compartments.\n\nBoth the front and rear seats are on the firm side, with lots of support. I loved both models on my long commute and felt that a long road trip in one would be welcome.\n\nThe trunk, too, is on par with the E-Class in terms of space, so golfers won’t have to fret about sacrificing practicality for the CLS’ style and performance.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe CLS550 starts at $71,300, which seems rather high considering its standard rear-wheel drive; it’s $73,800 with all-wheel drive. The E550 with the same engine has standard all-wheel drive for a starting price of $59,790. Much of that price difference is soaked up in the added standard features you get in the CLS, namely navigation, a premium stereo, bi-xenon headlights with LED running lights, and a few others that are available in a package on the E-Class for an additional $6,900.\n\nThe CLS offers performance on par with BMW’s 550i, which has better dynamics than an E-Class. And again, the nearly $10,000 price difference between the two is offset somewhat by the CLS’ standard features.\n\nYou can add more to the CLS, of course — most notably full LED active headlights that come as part of a $4,390 package that includes a rearview camera, a power rear sunshade, and heated and cooled front seats. That’s a package I doubt many CLS550 buyers will leave off. There are a few other stand-alone options, most notably a parking-assist feature that handles the steering for you during parallel parking — requiring the driver to handle braking — for $970 and a less-necessary night vision feature for $1,780.\n\nDespite the impressive performance, I can’t help but think there’s still a “styling surcharge” attached to the CLS.\n\nSafety\nThe CLS has not been crash-tested by either the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nIt comes equipped with seat-mounted side airbags for front passengers and side-curtain airbags for front and rear passengers.\n\nHigh-tech features like blind spot and lane departure warning systems are available in an $850 option package. The two are also available in another package, for $2,950, that also includes active cruise control that enables the car to sense a forward collision and apply full braking.\n\nCLS in the Market\nThe market for luxury cars is a funny thing. A stylish car with performance chops can be just as popular as a more practical selection at a lower price. The fact that the CLS sacrifices less against both its E-Class sibling and the competition should make it even more appealing to this group of buyers.\n\nSend David an email",
