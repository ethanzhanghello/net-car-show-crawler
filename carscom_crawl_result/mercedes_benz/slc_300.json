      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has refreshed and renamed its smaller roadster for the 2017 model year. The new SLC-Class, which comes as the SLC300 and its high-performance variant the Mercedes-AMG SLC43, arrives in time for the 20th anniversary of the 1996 launch of its predecessor, the SLK-Class.\n\n\nThe new name is a nod to the roadster's close genetic ties to the C-Class sedan, while style, sophistication and performance are the update's emphasis.\n\nExterior\n\n\nThe hardtop convertible’s front end features a steeply raked grille and elongated, arrow-shaped hood. The standard grille is finished in black with silver and chrome trim, with an optional chrome-finished grille with silver or high-gloss trim. The contoured bumper features air intakes and chrome trim along the lower edge and LED daytime running lamps integrated into the headlights.\n\nAluminum-alloy wheels come in 17 and 18 inches. At the rear, the bumper features a black diffuser and chrome flourishes as well as narrowed, horizontally divided LED taillights. The trunk lid has an accentuated arrow shape with a third brake light positioned on the spoiler lip.\n\nInterior\n\n\nAluminum trim with carbon-fiber finish adorns the cabin, while a redesigned instrument cluster updates the driver’s view of vehicle functions. The Comand multimedia system’s screen grows to 7 inches from the SLK’s 5.8 inches, and a dash-top analog clock tells the current time as it harkens the past. Available multimedia functions include navigation, a DVD player, Internet radio, Bluetooth connectivity with hands-free capabilities and voice-operated control, as well as two USB ports.\n\nThe roadster’s electrohydraulic roof can be opened or closed at speeds up to 25 mph so long as the process is begun from a standstill. Meanwhile, if the standard automatic trunk separator is in the upper position for max cargo space, it moves down when the top is dropped and stowed; if the trunk is full, the roof will not open and a notification will appear in the instrument cluster.\n\nOther interior features include a sport steering wheel with perforated grip, an optional three-spoke multifunction steering wheel wrapped in Nappa leather and microfiber upholstery with a new perforated design on the shoulder area of the electrically adjustable seats, contrast piping and stitching, and increased use of ambient lighting.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nThe SLC300 will use a version of the current SLK’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes says it’s good for a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.7 seconds on its way to a top speed of 130 mph. The high-performance SLC43 runs on a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder that makes 362 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque, shaving more than a second off that sprint and bumping the electronically limited top speed up by 25 mph.\n\nBoth engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission; the SLC43 adds an AMG sport suspension. The standard Dynamic Select feature allows the driver to choose from five selectable modes: Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, Eco and Individual.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAdvanced safety and driver-assistance features include standard collision-prevention braking and backup camera, and optional blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, dynamic LED headlights and parking assist.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class is a two-seat retractable-hardtop convertible that is smaller and less expensive than the automaker’s SL-Class roadster. It comes as the SLC 300 and performance-oriented AMG SLC 43. The SLC 300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and the AMG SLC 43 has a 385-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6. Both have rear-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The SLC competes with the Audi TT and Porsche Boxster.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nBlind spot warning is now standard, and Final Editions of both the SLC 300 and AMG SLC 43 are available. The SLC 300 Final Edition includes Selenite Grey paint, gloss-black trim, 18-inch gloss-black wheels, AMG sport seats finished in Nappa leather, gray seat belts, an AMG steering wheel and special badges. Meanwhile, the AMG SLC 43 Final Edition gets Sun Yellow paint, gloss-black trim, 18-inch matte-black wheels with yellow accents, AMG sport seats in Nappa leather, gray seat belts, an AMG steering wheel and special badges.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe SLC’s roof can be opened or closed at speeds up to 25 mph, though the process must start from a standstill. Mercedes’ available Airscarf neck-level heating system is designed to make top-down driving in cooler weather more comfortable. Standard safety features include automatic emergency braking and a driver drowsiness monitor.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nThe SLC serves as a cheaper alternative to the SL roadster, Mercedes’ long-standing luxury convertible that has a storied history and a larger following. Though the SLC provides somewhat sportier performance, it lacks the SL’s refinement and panache.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class is a two-seat retractable-hardtop convertible that is smaller and less expensive than the automaker's SL-Class roadster. It comes as the SLC300 and performance-oriented AMG SLC43. The SLC300 uses a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and the AMG SLC43 has a 385-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6. Both have rear-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The SLC competes with the Audi TT and Porsche Boxster.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nThe AMG SLC43's engine output has increased from 362 to 385 hp, and dual-zone climate control and adaptive LED headlights with automatic high beams are now standard. On the SLC300, blind spot warning, a Harman Kardon stereo and parking assist are new stand-alone options.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe SLC’s roof can be opened or closed at speeds up to 25 mph, though the process must start from a standstill. Mercedes' available Airscarf neck-level heating system is designed to make top-down driving in cooler weather more comfortable. Among the luxury trappings, aluminum trim with a carbon-fiber finish adorns the cabin. Standard safety features include automatic emergency braking and a driver drowsiness monitor.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class?\n\nThe SLC serves as a cheaper alternative to the SL roadster, Mercedes’ long-standing luxury convertible that has a storied history and a larger following. Though the SLC provides somewhat sportier performance, it lacks the SL’s refinement and panache.",
