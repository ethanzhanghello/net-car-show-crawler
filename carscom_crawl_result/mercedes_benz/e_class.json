      "expert_review": "You can credit Acura, Lexus and Infiniti for the stunning rebirth of Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe German automaker got caught with its lederhosen down when those Japanese luxury brands first entered the market in the mid- and late ’80s. Then, when the recession of the early ’90s hit, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti cars posted strong sales, while Mercedes and nearly all other European luxury brands faltered.\n\nThe Japanese cars were lighter and quicker. They came with more user-friendly features; they had higher quality, and they were less expensive than most of the European competition.\n\nMercedes-Benz, a company not known for acting quickly, began losing enormous sums of money. Its heavy, stodgy-looking cars were expensive gas guzzlers that weren’t much fun to drive.\n\nThen Mercedes saw the light.\n\nIn 1994, Mercedes began building cars such as the C-Class, which were lighter, faster and less expensive than the cars they replaced. But the small C-Class sedans were only a portent of things to come.\n\nThe stylish E-Class series of sedans, which came out late last year, has proven to be a watershed event in Mercedes history.\n\nThe E320, E300 Diesel and this week’s test car, the E420, have led Mercedes-Benz to double-digit sales increases this year. The German automaker is racking up some of the highest sales figures in the company’s 100-year history.\n\nMercedes’ strong performance comes at a time when the luxury car segment of the market is stagnant. Lincoln is struggling; Cadillac is holding its ground, and Acura and Lexus are fading.\n\nThe new E420 and its siblings far more exciting and better-looking than any Mercedes sedans of recent vintage. And now they cost less than most of the imported competition.\n\nFor Mercedes, things only get better from here. This fall, the new $40,000 SLK roadster hits the street. Then in about a year, Mercedes’ American-built sport-utility vehicle goes on sale.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nMercedes-Benz wasn’t the first on the block with a super high-tech 32-valve, double-overhead cam V-8.\n\nBut it may be best of its kind.\n\nThe 275-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 in the E420 delivers a seamless stream of power. Unlike the V-8 engine in the Lexus LS400 – which can lull you to sleep with its refrigerator-motorlike blandness – the E420’s engine has a real personality.\n\nIt’s quiet when you accelerate normally, but mash the gas pedal into the carpet and you’ll hear a soft symphony of wonderful mechanical noises as the rpms build. Mercedes says the E420 can bolt to 60 mph in just 6.7 seconds. That’s sports-car performance.\n\nThe E420 comes with a computerized five-speed automatic transmission that memorizes the habits of the driver and programs the shifts accordingly.\n\nDrive the E420 with a heavy foot and the transmission will shift more crisply for slightly better acceleration. If you drive the car easily, the shifts are virtually imperceptible. No longer does the driver have to flick a switch on the console from ”normal” to ”sport” as you do on other luxury cars.\n\nOne trait of the transmission isn’t so wonderful. If the E420 is rolling backward slightly when you shift into drive, it will shudder very rudely. The driver must stop completely when changing from reverse to drive.\n\nMercedes has designed the slotted shifter gate so that, without even looking, the driver can move the lever from fifth gear into third for a quick blast of power.\n\nOur test car required expensive premium unleaded fuel but used it at a reasonable rate for a large mid-size luxury/sports sedan. In the city with the air conditioner running, the E420 returned 17 miles per gallon. On the highway it delivered a solid 24 mpg.\n\nThe E420’s graceful handling traits may be the benchmark for all luxury sedans.\n\nWillingly and without fuss, the E420 performs anything you ask of it. There are very few sedans that so deftly blend the elements of sporty h ndling and luxury-car smoothness as well as the E420.\n\nDriven normally, the E420 is a smooth, quiet and solid luxury sedan. It doesn’t need a super-stiff, spine-cracking suspension to handle the demands of an enthusiastic driver. Driven aggressively, the E420 will slice through the sharpest curves on any road short of a race course.\n\nUnderneath the E420, Mercedes engineers made a radical break with the past. They replaced the recirculating ball system with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. The old suspension was replaced by modern double wishbone front system. Those improvements give the car an agile, athletic, lighter and more nimble feel than some of the heavy old sedans Mercedes used to build.\n\nThe E420’s beautifully styled body dips gently as the car drives over uneven pavement, such as a brick road. The driver and passengers don’t feel much of the action of the suspension system, which is attached to the stiffest body Mercedes has ever built.\n\nI was amazed at how sharply – 37.1 feet – the E420 can turn a circle. This must be the best turning radius in its class, or close to it. You appreciate that maneuverability when you need to make a U-turn on a narrow road or angle into a parking space in a crowded lot.\n\nThe four-wheel power-assisted disc brakes and traction control worked well.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe E420’s performance is only part of the car’s value story.\n\nAnother part is what you get for your money in comparison to other luxury cars, such as the Lexus LS400 and Cadillac Seville.\n\nWhen it comes to safety equipment, no car matches the E420, which is outfitted with four air bags, anti-lock brakes and a two traction control systems. One traction system, ASR (anti-slip control) prevents the wheels from spinning on slick roads. The other, ESP (electronic stability program) senses if the car is going in a direction other than it is being steered. For instance, if the E420 begins to fishtail, acomputer will apply one of the car’s left or right side brakes. This enables the driver to remain in control.\n\nAs far as equipment goes, the E420 has all the goodies: power memory seats, cruise control, an electric sunroof, built-in CD changer, dual zone fully automatic air conditioner and much more.\n\nThe seats are another big improvement. They’re a bit softer than some of the rock-hard perches of previous models.\n\nOur test car was assembled perfectly. And even though it is hard to call any luxury car priced at about $50,000 a bargain or a tremendous value, the E420’s styling, performance, safety equipment, quality, features and expected long life, leave you feeling as if you got more than your money’s worth.\n\nThis is one of the best all-around cars I’ve tested in 1996.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $49,900 Safety: Driver’s and passenger’s front and side air bags, side-impact protection, traction control, front and rear crumple zones, anti-lock brakes Price as tested: $53,060 EPA rating: 18 mpg city/25 highway Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The powerful Mercedes-Benz E420 is a handsome, high-quality sporty luxury sedan that is packed with safety features, loaded with accessories and a thrill to drive.",

      "expert_review": "Little things mean a lot.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive luxury car market, automakers must keepthemselves attuned to the finest details, for in this league the buyers areespecially discerning. Two cars see minor changes that make for a bigdifference in their make-up. The Mercedes Benz E-Class gets an 8-cylinderoption, while Jaguar’s XJ6 gets a long-wheelbase version of its venerablesedan platform. Here’s a look at two posh motorcars.\n\nWith sheet metal as stylish as that of the mid-sizedMercedes E-Class, you wonder why they need to advertise at all. The front issensuously shaped, with fenders that bulge into the hood over the round headlamps. The grille plays counterpoint to the massive lights, with finehorizontal chrome bands, crossed by a singular horizontal bar that intersectswith the famed three-pointed star. The look is arrestingly elegant and fresh.\n\nWhat’s under the hood is especially fresh. Although the E320 is powered bya 217-horsepower 3.2-litre six-cylinder engine, the E420 sports adouble-overhead-cam aluminum V8 engine. With 275 horsepower and 295foot-pounds of torque, this engine squirts to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds. Andunlike some past Mercedes engines, this one has good power down low. It buildsstrongly as the speed climbs to extra-legal velocity. There’s a slightcommotion to keep you informed of what’s going on.\n\nIf there’s anything that’s disappointing, it’s the light feel of this car.Unlike previous E sedans, this one doesn’t have that bank-vault solidness atspeed. Where you once felt a hunkered-down feeling at speed, this car answersback with a light, delicate feel that’s more Asian than German. Some mightfind this a radical change in character.\n\nThat’s not to say this car handles poorly. Quite the contrary. It handlesroads with grace and poise, delivering the typical firm but not punishingride. But that extra quotient of character that’s been a hallmark of Mercedeshandling is missing. Yet it’s still available in the line’s other cars.\n\nSafety is still of top concern to Mercedes. For 1997, all Mercedes,including the E-Class, have a front-seat-occupancy detection sensor. If achild of 26 pounds or less sits in the front seat, a sensor deactivates thepassenger side air bag. Also standard is traction control, anti-lock brakesand door-mounted side air bags.\n\nInside, all occupants are treated to the fine seating that ensures hours oftravel without back pain, despite a seat cushion that was firm and unyielding.\n\nThe center console is decorated with a finely polished wood. The controlsare simply set, yet their function takes some learning. The dual climatecontrol is much easier to use than previous units. Other luxury amenitiesinclude memory seating positions, built-in garage door opener and a Bose soundsystem specifically designed for the E-Class.\n\nThe base price for this heavy dose of Germanic civility is $49,990, withthe test vehicle’s bottom line fetching $52,450.\n\nW ith the current E-Class, Mercedes marks a change in attitude, one thatmarches to style as well as substance.* Jaguar XJ6L\n\nEven though the British have handed over Hong Kong to the Chinese and thesun has finally set on the Empire, there are still remainders of greatness.One of these is the Jaguar XJ6L.\n\nWhat Jaguar has wrought is a sedan fit for a king and his corgis. With a5-inch stretch in wheelbase, the car boasts more rear legroom and betterheadroom than the regular XJ6. With a length just over 202 inches, this car isno midget. But it still manages to look long and lean, with a sporting stancethat’s rare for cars in this class. Motivating this fine car is an inline,double-overhead-cam, aluminum 6-cylinder engine that produces 245 horsepowerat 4,800 rpm and 289 pound feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Powered through afour-speed automatic transmission with normal and sport modes, this car movesout with a subdued growl quicker than you can say, “Hail Britannia.”\n\nJags re famous for their adept balance of luxury and agility, and this caris no exception. The steering has power assist, yet never feels numb, withgood information telegraphed about what the wheels are doing. There is no bodylean in corners and stops are short and swift.\n\nInside, it’s the usual fine leathers and acres of polished wood. Somehow,it looks a lot more natural here than in almost any other competitor, with afinesse that screams refinement. Also unchanged are the fussy controls thatflank the Jag’s steering wheel. Once you get used to them, you’ll enjoy howthey work, but be sure to read the owner’s manual first.\n\nThe long wheelbase helps this car immensely, endowing it with a spaciousfeel that resembles a rolling palace on wheels.\n\nBut these British cars have always had a reputation for being somewhatunreliable. Thanks to Ford’s ownership over the last four years, the qualityproblems seem to have been greatly diminished to the point that you now usethe words quality and Jaguar in the same sentence without being laughed at.The last XJ6 I drove (sometime in 1990) seemed junky and overpriced. Itrattled and left me wondering who would buy one. This one was solid andwell-built, leaving me lusting after the mere thought of owning one.\n\nBut owning one means saving your shekels. The regular XJ6 starts at$54,400. The long wheelbase commands $59,500. The test vehicles optionsincluded a $350 convenience package (integrated garage door opener,three-position memory system and electrochromatic mirror) and a $2,000All-Weather Package (traction control, heated front and rear seats). Theengine requires premium fuel at a rate of 17 mpg city, 23 mpg highway. Testmileage was 16 mpg.\n\n* Conclusions\n\nLittle changes, big difference in cars. While Mercedes tries to add stylishto its list of attributes of strength and speed, Jaguar adds solid to its listof attributes, which includes stylish. Either will make your heart swoon. Butat this price, that’s a given.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With up to 39 inches of screens inside, the redesigned 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the techiest version yet — which might not appeal to the traditional Benz buyer. Still, all of the familiar E-Class hallmarks are there, including a glassy ride, a silky powertrain and an excellent collection of materials.\n\nVersus the competition: The E-Class remains near the top of the heap in the hotly contested luxury mid-size sedan class, with more tech and outright comfort than some offerings from BMW, Genesis, Audi and Lexus — just make sure you take it easy on the order form. \n\nAfter a week in an all-new 2024 Mercedes-Benz E350, the definition and general perception of “luxury” is still as nebulous as ever. Let’s start with a brief history lesson: For the better part of almost 70 years, luxury vehicles have been primarily defined by their size, materials, tinsel and trim; differentiation between the rides of the “haves” and the wagons of the “have-nots” has often distilled down to niceties like leather, chrome and burl wood.\n\nRelated: 577-HP 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Revealed\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nLuxury Lesson\n\nAdvancements in technology and production capability have naturally trickled down from the top, with cutting-edge entertainment, driving and safety tech usually making their debut in the premium and luxury market segments. Adaptive cruise control, navigation and infotainment mostly began as playthings for high earners to differentiate luxury cars from more mass-market vehicles that by then had begun to offer a wider array of plush interior packages, with soft-touch surfaces, leather and wood. It was a relatively simple differentiation: Spend more, get more tech accoutrements.\n\nA heady combination of increased production, economic struggles and the allure of growth — of both market share and profit margins — then pushed materials and build quality down for all (yes, all) luxury automakers between the late 1990s and late 2000s. At that point, the norm changed: Spend more, get modestly nicer materials and significantly elevated tech.\n\nBut it wasn’t long before that changed, too. Touchscreen infotainment, adaptive cruise control, active-safety features and digital displays rapidly proliferated in mass-market cars, with some loaded trims of workaday crossovers and sedans delivering a more comfortable experience than some base luxury trims. \n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nSuperscreen Supreme\n\nEverything’s cyclical. Now, modern luxury cars incorporate exotic (for the industry) materials like open-pore wood, cork, crystal, titanium, carbon and textured metal in their cabins, surrounding massive, hi-resolution displays that cover much of the dashboard real estate. And I do mean massive: My 2024 E350 test car was equipped with a pair — pair! — of 12.3-inch displays split between driver and passenger. With a 14.4-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash handling infotainment functions, that makes for a whopping 39 inches of digital acreage up front.\n\nRight off the bat, I’m not sure if the traditional Mercedes customer will be the biggest fan of this screened-in cockpit. While the days of demure, leather-lined boardrooms on wheels have long been in the past, there remained a pretense of balance between “old” Mercedes and a new, younger brand. ”Younger” is the key here; adapt or die, and all that. As luxury purchasers continue to skew younger — millennials and Generation Z drove most of the growth in luxury spending in 2023 — automakers are observably catering to this generational changeover.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMuch like BMW today is nearly unrecognizable from the brand it was 15 years ago, modern Mercedes is steadily pointing its products away from baby-boomer-and-older generations, with a focus on features that might make your grandfather’s hair curl: Configurable ambient mood lighting pulses to your music, slick graphics sparkle and surge across the sprawling screens, door handles are motorized pop-outs, and the cars’ swoopy, soft-edged surfaces appear lifted out of a concept car. It’s all very nu-tech and very “now.” \n\nTrendy Tech\n\nNone of this is an outright criticism, just something to consider if you’re looking for traditional luxury more than screens, screens, screens! Preferences aside, the new E-Class “works” for its intended function, offering quite the trick: A techy drive with oodles of surprise-and-delight features that keep your dopamine receptors sizzling.\n\nMercedes’ so-called Superscreen setup is one of the most graphically snazzy in the industry, with excellent processing speed, animations and refresh rate. Your front passenger will surely never bore if you opt to add the personal 12.3-inch display for them, which offers all manner of streaming functions, including YouTube. And lest you fear some aggressively distracted driving when they pull up the latest Cars.com video review, the display automatically (and non-negotiably) engages Private mode, wherein no portion of the screen is visible from the driver’s seat. Pretty neat.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nIf you’re all in on this, make sure you spec your E350 in Pinnacle trim, which adds a top-shelf Burmester 4D sound system with both Dolby Atmos and Apple Spatial Audio, turning your morning commute into Mercedes’ best approximation of a theater. Concerned about frustrating complexity? Don’t be. The rest of Merc’s MBUX digital architecture is mostly as you left it in the last generation, offering meaningful interface updates as needed but leaving general menu navigation and specific functions in place. My exposure to the next-gen E-Class was limited to that loaded-out E350, but buyers are under no obligation to spec the Superscreen, which is optional. In fact, leaving that passenger display off the order form results in an environment not dramatically different from the prior-generation car. \n\nComfort King\n\nLook past the lights and you’ll find panels trimmed in a familiar concoction of gloss-black plastic, frosted aluminum and dark wood. The optional leather upholstery is similarly rich and extended, with my test car’s ivory interior fabulously complementing its intriguing Verde Silver Metallic paint. The cosseting stuff is still there, with standard heated front seats and options including a heated steering wheel, heated front armrest, ventilated and massaging front seats, and a cabin fragrance system.\n\nIn symphony, it’s quite a lovely place to dispatch traffic clogs and bland scenery, buoyed by my test car’s $3,200 adaptive air suspension and rear-wheel steering. The ride is requisitely silky for both the price and the badge, soaking up all ne’er-do-well potholes and expansion joints without compromising body control. Comfort mode isn’t too wallowy and Sport isn’t too stiff; both offer excellent balance.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nSteering is effortless and smooth, and turning the thick-rimmed leather wheel feels like churning a column through a vat of melted butter. Conversely, the brakes were a mite touchy, often surprising my otherwise comfy and coddled passenger with a sudden lurch. I acclimated relatively quickly, but it was never quite as smooth as I’d prefer.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nRedesigned 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Priced From $63,450\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet: Fusion of C and E, Priced From $65,500\n2024 Mercedes-AMG CLA35 Review: Small and Spendy\nShop for a 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class\nPampering Powertrain\n\nSpeaking of smooth, the 2024 E350 still has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder under its hood, but the powertrain gains a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system for 2024. The result is 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, and it makes its way to all four tires through a nine-speed automatic transmission and Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. Power is more than adequate for its purpose, with Mercedes estimating a 0-60 mph scoot in a respectable 6.1 seconds.\n\nThose numbers aren’t bad, but who cares? The E350 is entirely about refined, isolating daily transportation, not specs. And despite the above treatise on the changing definition of luxury and this car’s astounding amount of screens, the all-new E-Class continues to be a benchmark in its class. \n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nYou gotta take it easy with the order form, though, lest you end up with an $82,000 (prices include destination) E350, as I did. Not that this fine sled isn’t “worth” that buy-in, but the E-Class positively guzzles add-ons and packages without much warning. If I were in a spendy mood, I’d certainly pass by the $63,450 base E350, opting instead for a 375-hp, six-cylinder E450 that won’t cost a penny less than $69,250 even if you leave everything else on the assembly line. \n\nBut where’s the fun in that? Imagine all the screen time you’d be missing out on.  \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With the new E320 Station Wagon, Mercedes-Benz has introduced a car that is essentially obsolete.\n\nThe dramatic rise in minivans and then sport-utility vehicles in the last 15 years has made the station wagon almost extinct. Only Subaru’s sporty all-wheel drive Outback wagons are selling well. Nearly all other automakers have thrown in the towel and switched from wagons to vans and sport-utilities.\n\nAs I test-drove the E320 Station Wagon, I couldn’t help but think of Mercedes’ own sport-utility, the ML320, and how much more it offers.\n\nThe ML320 comes with the same V-6 engine and five-speed transmission as well as standard all-wheel drive. It offers about the same level of equipment, yet the ML320 sells for about $10,000 less.\n\nYou’d really have to want a Mercedes wagon to make a compelling case for the E320.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nMercedes’ first V-6 engine is a marvel.\n\nIt’s an aluminum 3.2-liter overhead cam motor outfitted with three valves and two spark plugs per cylinder. Horsepower is rated at 221. Performance is terrific. Mercedes says the E320 Station Wagon can bolt to 60 mph in less than eight seconds — not bad for a car that weighs nearly 3,700 pounds.\n\nI’ve driven cars with V-8 engines and more horsepower that can’t match the performance of the Mercedes V-6.\n\nWhen you press the accelerator, the engine hums nicely as it winds up. The car moves forward very briskly — and instantaneously. One reason for the E320’s responsiveness is that it’s one of the first cars on the road to be equipped with a “drive-by-wire” system. Instead of the accelerator being connected to the engine’s fuel injection system in the traditional way, with mechanical linkage, the pedal’s movements are measured electronically. A computer instantly signals the engine when the pedal moves.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission delivers smooth shifts. A computerized program in the transmission adjusts theshifts in accordance to the habits of the driver. For instance, if one were to drive with a heavy foot, the shifts would be delayed slightly.\n\nAnother standard feature: a traction control system that uses the brakes and throttle to restore traction once the wheels lose their grip on slippery roads.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension system keeps the car planted firmly on the pavement, even in sharp, fast cornering. At first the E320 wagon feels a bit unwieldy, but when you toss it into a curve the suspension seems to tighten up. In an emergency accident avoidance maneuver, such as a very fast change of directions, the E320 wagon will remain stable and easy to control.\n\nI was most impressed with the car’s excellent turning radius of 37.1 feet. This makes the big car easy to handle in tight parking situations or when you need to make a U-turn on city streets. The steering wheel has a light, smooth and easy feel.\n\nThe E320 Station Wagon comes with standard p ower-assisted four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. The brakes are strong, and the anti-lock system stops the car quickly and without trauma.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe interior of the Mercedes-Benz E320 is functional and handsome but lacks the warmth and sensuousness of a Jaguar XJ8.\n\nWhen you sit in a Jaguar, your senses are attacked by the wonderful smell of Connolly leather upholstery, soft wool carpet, large planks of wood and a gold Jaguar logo on the steering wheel. That makes you feel like you bought something special.\n\nThe upholstery in our test car was some kind of vinyl or plastic, not the aromatic leather you might expect in a $50,000 automobile. I also found some of the switches in the Mercedes awkward to use.\n\nTo engage the cruise control, you have to flip a lever behind the windshield wiper on the left side of the steering column. But the two levers are too close together. Several times I turned on the windshield wiper when I wanted to set the cruise control.\n\nAlso, I think Mercedes could do a better job with the dual-zone air-conditioning switches. A rotary knob system instead of the buttons and switches would simplify the system.\n\nWith the rear seats folded forward, the interior of the E320 wagon is cavernous. I stuffed an adult bicycle in the back and closed the rear door. In the tail section, there’s a fold-away rear-facing seat that, when up, increases seating capacity to seven. Only kids could be comfortable back there, though. However, the mid-section’s rear bench seat offers plenty of comfort and ample room.\n\nThe E320 Station Wagon comes with everything– cruise control, power sunroof, electric seats with memory and more. Dual front and side air bags are standard. Mercedes expects to sell about 3,500 of these wagons per year in the United States– which is not very many.\n\nIf I wanted a Mercedes-Benz that could move a lot of people in comfort, I’d get the ML320 sport-utility and save $10,000. It’s better looking and more fun to drive than the E320 station wagon.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $46,500. Safety: Dual front and side air bags, anti-lock brakes, traction control and side-impact protection. Price as tested:$50,370. EPA rating: 16 mpg city/21 mpg highway. ncentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: Though it performs well and comes with a long list of standard equipment, the E320 Wagon is not one of Mercedes’ best ideas.",

      "expert_review": "One thing an automotive writer lives with is automobile envy.\n\nNo one notices the SUVs, minivans or plain-Jane sedans driven week after week. But drive a Mercedes-Benz and the “gee, life is rough all over” comments come fast and furious.\n\nNot that I can blame them. After all, who really turns their head at most blobby sedans or boxy SUVs these days?\n\nThis car with its three-pointed star at least has some lines to it.\n\nActually, the new E-Class is sleek and sexy, lacking in some of the heaviness usually found in German automotive design. There is no huge departure from the previous E-Class, but the Mercedes faithful will find plenty of change and plenty to like on Mercedes’ most popular line.\n\nFor 2003, the E-Class is available in two flavors: the E320 with a 221-horsepower 3.2-liter V-6 and the E500 with a 302-horsepower V-8 engine. Both engines come with a five-speed automatic transmission with manual shift capability.\n\nThe 4Matic four-wheel-drive option in the E-Class, that is not available on the 2003 model, will be back for the 2004 model year.\n\nThe E500 distinguishes itself from its less powerful sibling by employing an air suspension, which Mercedes has dubbed Airmatic DC rather than simply calling it an air suspension. The suspension helps keep the car level, which it does in an unobtrusive manner.\n\nThe E500 also gets larger tires, P245/45R17s rather than P225/55R16s.\n\nBoth E-Class cars get the usual blizzard of electronic gear aimed at keeping passengers safe. Electronic braking is employed for the first time in the E-Class. Simply put, a computer tells the valves how hard to apply the brakes.\n\nThe system can change the brake pressure on each wheel, so the outside wheels get more pressure when braking in turns.\n\nFront passenger-side airbags activate only if a sensor detects someone sitting in it.\n\nThe driver can select the shock absorber setting, which even affects the ride height. Select a sporty ride and the car lowers by just over half an inch. An electronic stability program incorporates the electronic braking system and traction control, in addition to sensors that detect acceleration and vehicle yaw.\n\nAnd that’s just what you don’t see.\n\nThere is an optional multi-function trip computer dubbed COMAND by Mercedes-Benz. It’s incorporated in an optional GPS navigation system. An electronic parking aid senses when you’re approaching an object. The rear headrests also get electronic help – they fold down at the push of a button. The front seats are power activated as well. Another button activates the rear sunshade. The E500 even comes with four-zone climate control. Each passenger can adjust the airflow to his or her liking.\n\nThat’s not to mention an optional cell phone or the array of buttons that surround the stereo or the ones on the steering wheel to access some functions quickly and easily.\n\nSo if your VCR always reads 12 p.m., this might scare you a bit. But don’t let it. The bottom line to all the electronic gewgaws is this: the new E-Class delivers the same steel hand in a velvet glove ride that Mercedes is known for.\n\nThis year, the dashboard is as curvaceous and modern as its exterior styling.\n\nLow level ambient light constantly illuminates the interior in a soft glow.\n\nThe seats are very firm and could be a bit deeper. But don’t assume that seat heaters are standard equipment, they’re optional. Also optional is a steering wheel heater.\n\nAnother optional amenity is something Mercedes dubs Drive Dynamic seats. The seat’s side bolsters inflate to increase lateral support. and the seat has a massaging feature.\n\nFront seat room is quite generous, but rear seat space is lacking, considering the size of the car. It actually feels tighter than the 2002 E-Class and some compromise will be needed if you’re transporting tall passengers. Where did all the space go? Into the trunk, which seems larger than its 15.9 cubic foot rating.\n\nThe E500 provided for testing was fast, feeding its appetite for fuel at a rate of 15 mpg.\n\nReplete with buttons and featuring miles of electronic wiring and circuitry, the new E-Class with its boatload of luxury, has a velvety quiet and confident ride that traditional Benz buyers expect.\n\nThere’s little that is radically different in feel from the current car. But the increasing amount of gadgetry seems like overkill. After all, simplicity is the ultimate luxury.\n\nNevertheless, everything is automatic, which is what Mercedes-Benz buyers expect, and it’s all wrapped in a shell that is better looking than ever.\n\nMercedes-Benz E500\n\nEngine: 5-liter SOHC V-8\n\nTransmission: 5-speed auto/manual\n\nTires: P245/45R17\n\nWheelbase: 112.4 inches\n\nLength: 190.3 inches\n\nWidth: 71.3 inches\n\nWeight: 3,815 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 15.9 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $54,850\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 16 city, 23 highway\n\nTest mileage: 15 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: Germany",

      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz E450 All-Terrain a Good Luxury Station Wagon?\n\nThe E450 All-Terrain is a joy to drive on pavement; it’s a roomy, comfortable and expensive vehicle, laden with overwrought technology that frustrates more than it impresses. Even so, it’s not just a good luxury station wagon, it might well be the epitome of the form.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Mercedes-Benz E450 All-Terrain Compare With Other Luxury Station Wagons?\n\nThe Volvo V90 Cross Country and Audi A6 Allroad are the other luxurious and off-road-oriented station wagons on sale (for now), but the E450 All-Terrain is posher and more powerful. All three, however, including the Benz, may not be long for this world as automakers transition to SUVs and leave the wagon realm to performance vehicles.\n\nStation wagons are a dying breed, but there are some encouraging signs of life from high-performance wagons, of all things. Mercedes-Benz announced its own return to the class with the coming AMG E53 Hybrid wagon, but even before that, the cupboard back in Stuttgart labeled “wagons for the U.S.” wasn’t bare: Meet the 2025 E450 All-Terrain, a luxury wagon cosplaying as an off-road vehicle.\n\nRelated: The Performance Wagon Is Back: 2026 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Wagon Revealed\n\nThe E450 All-Terrain wears plastic cladding on its fenders and below its rear bumper, with more cladding and a chrome strip on its rocker panels. It sports an adjustable air suspension with off-road settings, plus an off-road page in its touchscreen and the fanciest camera tech money can buy — including an “invisible hood” view.\n\nMake no mistake, though: This is a luxury wagon meant to devour highway miles, with space for both cargo and you and your family (and maybe a friend, too).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Much Does the E450 All-Terrain Cost?\n\nThe short answer to this question is a pretty penny. The E450 All-Terrain starts at $77,250 (including destination charge). Our test vehicle totaled $87,960 with its variety of options, and it was missing an available Multicontour Seating Package, which includes massaging front seats. A nearly $90,000 Mercedes that won’t massage me? Please. (That statement is more than a bit bougie, I know, but I stand by it.)\n\nThe E450 All-Terrain is more expensive than direct competitors like the Volvo V90 Cross Country and Audi A6 Allroad, but it costs significantly less than trendy performance wagons like the Audi RS 6 Avant and BMW M5 Touring. Its price tag also puts this wagon in a bit of an odd place in Mercedes’ own lineup: The similarly sized and capable GLE SUV starts more than $10,000 less, and the larger three-row GLS SUV has a starting price just a bit higher than our decently equipped E450 All-Terrain.\n\nHow Does the E450 All-Terrain Drive?\n\nLet’s get our off-road impressions out of the way: During our time with the wagon, we took our test vehicle to Holly Oaks ORV Park in Holly, Mich. … and left it in the parking lot. It did very well on (maintained) unpaved roads, but we were at the park for a comparison test of more serious off-road vehicles.\n\nOn the highway and around town, however, the E450 behaves beautifully. Its mild-hybrid, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder powertrain produces 375 horsepower, which dwarfs the V90 Cross Country’s 295-hp output and exceeds the A6 Allroad’s 335 hp — and that’s not counting the Mercedes’ boost mode, which unleashes an extra 23 hp and 151 pounds-feet of torque when called upon. Mercedes says the E450 can go from 0-60 mph in 4.6 seconds, and that certainly feels believable — perhaps even a little conservative. Power delivery is pleasantly linear, and the standard nine-speed automatic transmission usually finds the right gear without issue, though it can be hesitant when you put the accelerator to the floor.\n\nWith two adults and luggage, we observed fuel economy in line with the E450’s EPA rating of 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined. The wagon thrives on the highway, and the standard Airmatic air suspension makes for a comfortable and composed ride. As an added bonus, in its Comfort setting, the suspension automatically lowers the car by 0.6 inch at speeds above 75 mph for improved efficiency. The ride firms up in Sport mode, and with our test vehicle’s optional 20-inch wheels and tires, impacts over bumps and highway seams were a bit too harsh for my taste. My preferred driving setting was the Individual program, which allows drivers to pick and choose a variety of settings to their liking. I had the steering and powertrain set to Sport, for improved responsiveness and the weightier steering feel I prefer, but the suspension in Comfort, for a cushier ride.\n\nJudged on driving experience alone, the E450 All-Terrain is worth every penny.\n\nHow Good Is the E450 All-Terrain’s Interior and Technology?\n\nAs with many current-generation Mercedes vehicles, this feels like a very mixed bag. On one hand, the E450 All-Terrain’s interior is spacious and comfortable (even without massaging front seats). Materials quality is mostly excellent, especially with the optional Leather Package — different from the also optional leather upholstery on our test vehicle — which adds leather to the upper dashboard. The cabin is quiet and outward visibility is solid.\n\nOn the other hand (literally), the touch-sensitive steering-wheel controls feel cheap and are clumsy to operate. I would like to have a chat with the individual who thought the small volume slider should also have an option for single-press input. It’s too easy to slide when you mean to press once or press once when you mean to slide. On top of that, the large 14.4-inch central touchscreen houses most of the climate controls, which I’d prefer to manage via actual physical controls. Below it is a single bar of touch-sensitive controls for drive modes, the camera system and audio controls. Some Mercedes models — including the GLE SUV — still have buttons, switches and knobs, and those models feel more luxurious than this.\n\nThe optional Superscreen adds a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the front passenger that is sometimes visible to the driver even while in motion, which I found distracting. It also offers a feature set (games, internet browser, video streaming) that feels, at best, redundant in an era of smart devices, but I’ll bet it still wows shoppers on the showroom floor.\n\nAn Off-Road page lives in the All-Terrain’s central touchscreen, and it’s full of the usual goodies, like gauges to measure the wagon’s attitude, hill descent controls, and a dedicated camera system that includes an invisible hood view for traversing obstacles without the aid of an outside spotter. These are nice software features, but the E450 lacks the hardware to fully take advantage of them.\n\nThe E450 All-Terrain also includes a built-in AI assistant that’s capable of chiming in without a direct prompt from a vehicle occupant, leading to many mid-conversation interruptions — followed by myself and my passenger responding with some version of “Shut up!” or “Go away!” with increasing levels of frustration. The one saving grace for this … feature … is that you have the option to turn it off, and the menu used to do so is fairly easy and intuitive to navigate.\n\nWhile the cabin is plush, it’s overloaded with pricey gizmos and gadgetry that feel destined to frustrate — or go unused. Our E450’s nearly $88,000 price tag becomes harder to swallow when you consider how its features actually work.\n\nMore Mercedes-Benz News From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE450e a Good Plug-In Hybrid SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\n2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Review: The Great Compromise\nHow Much Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe?\nLighting the Grille: Mercedes-Benz Fans Flames With First Look at New GLC EV\nShould You Buy an E450 All-Terrain or an SUV?\n\nIt might sometimes seem that auto writers are legally obligated to rave about station wagons — given how many of my fellow auto writers do — but while I do like a good station wagon, the prospect of paying almost $88,000 for an all-terrain luxury wagon full of annoying technology really tests my limits. With the base GLE SUV carrying a significantly lower starting price (and also costing several thousand dollars less when equipped with the same powertrain as the E450 All-Terrain), plus Mercedes’ larger, three-row GLS’ base price being similar to the as-tested price of our E450, I have a hard time arguing for the All-Terrain on practical grounds.\n\nBut for wagon devotees who don’t want a high-performance model, the E450 All-Terrain drives so well I’m willing to overlook its technological and aesthetic issues. Maybe I do have a bit of a wagon bias after all.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "QUALITY IS never having to say you’re sorry, and if that soundslike someone’s definition of love, you’re right.\n\nYou want to understand quality? Do something for someone you careabout. I did. I spent a weekend here assembling furniture for one of mydaughters.\n\nThe kid will have to live with the furniture for the next threeyears. I wanted to make sure that it was put together right. Correctassembly ensures longevity, and it improves chances for safe andpleasurable use.\n\nMercedes-Benz understands what I mean. That’s why it builds cars asgood as the tested 1995 E320 wagon. It’s a super-tight wagon, nothingwobbly or shaky about it.\n\nIn fact, if there’s one big complaint about the E320 wagon, it’sthat the thing is overdone.\n\nThe E320 is built like a vault, but it runs like a sports car. Noone needs that kind of quality in what is supposed to be an ordinaryfamily hauler. But having sampled the E320’s many pleasures in the harshenvironments of the New Jersey Turnpike and the jampacked streets ofthis city’s West Side, I’m glad that the people at Mercedes-Benz caredenough to reach way beyond the acceptable in bringing their wagon tomarket.\n\nBackground: At a base price of $47,500, the E320 is the second mostexpensive station wagon sold in the United States. The most expensive isBMW’s 530iT Touring wagon, which carries a base price of $48,600.\n\nIn that costly climate, the E320 is the best buy — because it’smore comfortable on the road, has more sensibly arranged cargo space anda more fuel-efficient engine and, well, for the life of me, because Ijust can’t see why the BMW costs $1,100 more.\n\nMercedes-Benz will keep the current E320 wagon through the 1996model year, after which it will introduce a new 1997 model. That meansconsumers who want and who have the wherewithal to buy a top stationwagon might get a price break, if they’re willing to take a 1995 or 1996E320.\n\nFor the deep of pocket, there’s much to recommend buying a currentE320, beginning with safety.\n\nNo individual consumer buys a vehicle to crash it. (The governmentand the private Insurance Institute for Highway Safety spend money thatway.) But if you had a serious crash, you’d want to be in an E320 withits heavy-gauge steel body, dual-front air bags, knee bolsters,automatically tensioning seat belts and standard power four-wheel discbrakes with anti-lock backup.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive E320 wagon is equipped with a 3.2-liter,double overhead-cam, inline six-cylinder engine rated 217 horsepower at5,500 rpm. Max torque is set at 229 pound-feet at 3,750 rpm.\n\nThe E320 can carry seven people. With the rear seats up, it canhaul 42.3 cubic feet of cargo; with the seats down, cargo space is 76.8cubic feet.\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission is standard in the E320.\n\nComplaints: The curtain rod that spools and unspools the vinylcovering that hides stored cargo remains attached to the left rear seatwhen that seat is lowered. The attachment gets in the way of the cargo.\n\nPraise: All-around excellence. Great road car. You literally feelsafe inside this one.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: The E320 outmaneuvered many sportscars and wannabe sports cars on the New Jersey Turnpike. Excellentacceleration (0 to 60 miles per hour in 8.2 seconds), excellent ride andhandling. Superior braking system.\n\nMileage: About 23 to the gallon (19-gallon tank, estimated 420-milerange on usable volume of required premium unleaded), running with twooccupants, a bike and lots of “ready-to-assemble” furniture.\n\nSound system: Six-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette withoptional CD disc changer. Installed by Mercedes-Benz. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested 1995 E320 is $47,500. Dealerinvoice on base model is $40,410. Price as tested is $52,380, includingan estimated $1,450 in federal luxury taxes, $2,835 in options and a$595 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Your call. Compare with BMW 5 30iT and 525iTTouring wagons, Audi A6 wagon, Volvo 850 Sportswagon and Volvo 940 and960 wagons.",

      "expert_review": "Until the start of the 1994 model year, Mercedes-Benz had been in a serious funk – almost completely out of sync with what today’s luxury car buyers have on their shopping lists.\n\nFor example, when value-minded up-scale buyers said they wanted lighter, less expensive and better-handling cars such as the Lexus LS 400, Mercedes delivered the heavy, pricey and cumbersome S-class cars.\n\nWith such extravagances as a gas-sucking 12-cylinder engine and double-paned glass on the door windows, many of the S-class cars sank in the marketplace like a torpedoed U-boat.\n\nBut things are changing for Mercedes-Benz.\n\nLike the strengthening Big Three domestic automakers, Mercedes-Benz also took a good, hard look at the market, listened to its customers and then started fixing things.\n\nWith the arrival last October of the new entry-level C-Class – a lighter, better-equipped pair of small cars than the old 190 series they replaced – Mercedes-Benz has served notice that it intends to remain a force to be dealt with in the luxury car market.\n\nAnd that brings us to this week’s test car, the new E300 Diesel. The sedan, a remarkable car in several ways, must be considered the second phase of Mercedes’ recovery.\n\nIf there was a doubt about the Mercedes losing its engineering edge to Lexus or any other Japanese, European or American automaker, this car could very well erase it.\n\nMercedes claims the E300 is cleanest, quietest diesel automobile money can buy. And after a week behind the wheel, I believe it.\n\nIn terms of performance and refinement, the E300 takes diesel engines to the next level.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nI never have been a fan of diesel engines – until now.\n\nWhen I think of diesel engines, I think of smoke, fumes, soot and loud chattering. And that’s the kicker with E300 Diesel – it had none of those traits.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the E300’s 3.0-liter, straight six-cylinder engine runs about as smoothly and quietly as a large displacement four-cylinder.\n\nAcceleration is a bit slow from a stop, but once the 134-horsepower engine winds up to about 3,500 rpm – around 35 or 40 mph – the E300’s performance is perfectly acceptable. It even has adequate passing power on the highway.\n\nFloor the accelerator at 50 mph, and the four-speed automatic will slip smoothly into third gear and the car will gain speed quickly enough to safely overtake slower traffic.\n\nAt slow speeds – especially at idle – the fuel-injected, 24-valve engine runs exceptionally smooth for a diesel. The engine is very quiet too. Once you get moving, you can’t hear the engine when the radio is played at a regular volume.\n\nUnder full acceleration with the car loaded, I noticed no black smoke coming from the exhaust pipe – a common trait of other diesel engines.\n\nMercedes engineers also outfitted the E300 with a catalytic converter. The converter burns off engine gases, which makes for less pollution. The E3 00 runs so clean that it is certified for sale in smog-choked California. In fact, it’s the only diesel-powered car that can ben sold there, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOne of the nice things about the E300 Diesel is that it can go along distance between fill-ups, thanks to its fuel-sipping engine and large fuel tank. On the highway, the E300 can travel about 750 miles on a tankful of diesel fuel. In city driving, you probably will get close to 600 miles out of the 23.8 gallon fuel tank.\n\nThe car should be economical to run and maintain. Figure about $28 to fill the tank. Few cars the size of the E300 can go farther on a tank of fuel for less money. And the diesel engine should run for far more than 100,000 miles with no major repairs.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe 3,500-pound E300 Diesel is the first Mercedes-Benz I have driven in at least three years that feels nimble and agile.\n\nUnlike other recent Mercedes cars I have tested, this one is not tiring to drive. The power-assisted steering works smoothly and doesn’t require as much effort to operate as previous Mercedes cars.\n\nThe steering system has little play in it, but its response is somewhat dull. To make a sharp turn, you have to turn the wheel slightly more than normal.\n\nA firm four-wheel independent suspension system and power-assisted four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes help make the E300 Diesel very competent in handling and braking.\n\nInside, road noise is practically nonexistent.\n\nThe test car – as with all Mercedes – felt exceptionally sturdy, solid and well-built.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nExcept for the seats, which felt rock hard and had little flex, there is nothing to dislike about the E300 Diesel.\n\nThe contoured dash is typical Mercedes-Benz. It contains a full set of attractive, easy-to-read analog gauges and two air bags.\n\nThe AM/FMcassette radio and ozone-friendly air conditioner are first rate.\n\nOne of the ways Mercedes improved the user-friendliness of its interiors was to make the radio easier to operate. The touch-sensitive buttons that change the stations are a big improvement over previous Mercedes radios. However, for $41,000, a CD player should be standard.\n\nAs with other Mercedes cars, the E300 also uses top-grade materials. The carpet is thick and luxurious. The leather on the seats is tough, durable and stylish.\n\nThe switches for the lights, air conditioner and cruise control require a bit more effort to operate but convey a sturdy, built-to-last feeling.\n\nHowever, I just can’t understand why the seats are so firm. I have never driven a car with seats as hard as the E300. The first thing I would do upon purchasing this car is invest in a thick set of sheepskin seat covers. Otherwise, the car would be almost unbearable to live with day to day.\n\nInterior room is generally excellent. Visibility is good from all angles, and the trunk can hold plenty of cargo.\n\nDespite the seats, I like the E300 Diesel. I can’t think of another car I would like to take on long road trips.\n\nIn my book, Mercedes’ new diesel engine ranks as one of the 1994 model year’s more significant achievements.\n\nTruett’s tip: The E300 Diesel is a smooth, quiet and clean-running machine that performs almost like a gasoline-powered automobile. It may change your mind about diesel cars.",

      "expert_review": "What’s the top family sedan on the market today, something that blends comfort and accommodations with safety, performance and practicality? One that’s not too big and not too small, that’s high on value and longevity?\n\nI’d have to go with the Mercedes-Benz E320.\n\nOf course, it takes at least $47,000 to get one, which is why you’ll never find the Benz among the year’s top-selling sedans. But for those with the cash, the E320 remains the best choice for all the right reasons. This is a car that does nearly everything well, and does it with style and grace.\n\nThe E-Class cars – the V-6-powered E320, V-8-enhanced E430, fiery E55 and the E320 wagon – are Mercedes midrange cars and their best-selling models. Some buy them for luxury and prestige, others for sturdiness and reliability.\n\nWhat do you get for your 47 grand? The E320 is a true luxury car, with an accommodating cabin filled with leather, wood, electronic gizmos, a fine stereo system, 10-way power seats and nicely crafted appointments. There is a full array of advanced safety features, such a multiple airbags, including side-impact curtains; brake assist, which enhances brake-pedal pressure during panic stops; stability control; traction control; anti-lock brakes; and Mercedes’ vaunted safety-cell body structure.\n\nThe initial feel of the E320 is heavy and vaultlike, with doors that close with a solid “thunk” and an interior that’s tight and businesslike. Getting under way, the Benz quickly shows itself to be nimble despite its heft, with responsive if slightly heavy steering, quick cornering capabilities and strong acceleration from the 221-horsepower V-6.\n\nThe engine power is surprising. This is a relatively small V-6, but it pulls the hefty sedan with authority right from the word go, due partly to a nicely engineered, two-stage intake manifold. The throttle is electronic, doing away with mechanical linkage.\n\nFor those who yearn for more power, the E430 has a 275-horsepower V-8 and a bigger price tag. Or, if you want your sedan to have race-car responsiveness, go for the E55, an AMG-enhanced V-8 model with 349 horsepower and major adjustments to suspension, steering, wheels and tires. AMG is Mercedes’ performance arm, recently brought in-house after years of independently tuning Benzes to howl.\n\nAll E-Class cars, including the seven-seat wagon, are available with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission nicely combines automatic shifting with a Touch Shift do-it-yourself feature. This is probably my favorite auto-shift setup, with the shift lever always in position for manual shifting.\n\nOtherwise, the shifting lacks the sharp response that I expect from Mercedes. The shifts are slow and soft, even under heavy throttle. And I still can’t get used to the adaptive feature, which adjusts to individual driving characteristics. I find the shifting unpredictable and kind of annoying.\n\nHandling is competent and refined, but it would be a stretch to call the E320 a sport sedan. The responses are sharp, but certainly not as much so as the 5-Series BMW. An optional Sport package offers stiffer suspension and performance wheels and tires.\n\nThe major competition comes from Toyota’s Lexus division, always hot on Mercedes’ tail. Last year, Lexus took the crown as top-selling luxury brand in the United States after Mercedes eclipsed Cadillac in 1999.\n\nThe E-Class is hard to beat, for those with the price of admission. It was a hard car to give up after toting my family and friends for a week. It would be the perfect car for us, except for that pesky price tag.",

      "expert_review": "If you’re a regular reader of this column, there’s a good chance you went to any number of classic car shows over the summer.\n\nIf you’re not into the old car hobby, you might just wonder what sort of car could end up at such a show a couple decades hence.\n\nYour answer could be found at the show’s Mercedes Benz’s area, where you could take a look at a silver four-door E55 on display. I’d put money on it that the new Mercedes Benz E55 would fit the bill.\n\nBy now, you’re familiar with the Mercedes Benz E-Class. It’s a mid-level, mid-sized offering from Mercedes. The front end identity, with its rounded hood and round headlights, along with a svelte, graceful sedan body is still fresh. It incorporates a big nod to past Mercedes sedans while giving the overall look of the mid-sized cars a new direction.\n\nIts overall performance is equally satisfying. Available with a 221-horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder or 275 horsepower eight-cylinder, the vehicle’s speed, agility and engineering are well-known. So how do you take such a good car and make it better?\n\nHand it over to AMG.\n\nAMG is a German performance house that takes the family Mercedes and turns it into a mobile missile. AMG has been doing this for years and they know how to do it right.\n\nMercedes now owns a majority interest in AMG, so expect more of this in the future.\n\nThere’s little here to indicate externally that your Mercedes is special, unless you see the discreet AMG badge on the trunk lid. Then look at the tires. Wide, low profile 18-inch tires reside on those wheels. That’s it.\n\nBut it’s what’s under the hood that counts: A screaming 5.5-liter 349-horsepower V8. It produces a concrete-crinkling 390 pound-feet of torque. This is basically the SL500’s 5-liter V8, enlarged to 5.5 liters with a larger crankshaft and better breathing.\n\nPower is fed through a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission that also sees duty in Mercedes’ 6-liter V12 models. This unit is used for its ability to handle massive amounts of torque. It clicked off the shifts quickly, downshifting without hesitation.\n\nMercedes provides an Electronic Stability Program, which can be shut off if you’d like to try some tire-peeling burnouts. It would be out of character for the car. The torque curve is flat, and when you goose the gas, the power comes on sure and strong. And it just keeps coming, and coming, and coming, and coming and…\n\nThe power is strong enough to press you back into you seatback, like taking-off in an airplane.\n\nRide is a bit firmer than standard E-Class, but it’s not punishing. The trade-off is great cornering, important when dealing with 349 horses. Thank the car’s suspension, which rides softer over bumps at low speeds, firming up when the speed increases. Many luxury cars do this, but not with the invisible hand that Mercedes is able to accomplish.\n\nWhat’s so amazing is, despite all the speed and power, there’s an amazing amount of refinement a nd calm that this car displays. For a sedan with four more horsepower than a Corvette, you’d expect more theatrics. But this car carries it off with unruffled demeanor.\n\nThat means the driver of this rocket must pay attention. This car does just what’s told and quickly. The steering is somewhat light, but still communicates. It also means skipping the use of the cupholders. They just don’t belong in such a serious sports sedan. (neither do car phones, but I won’t get into that).\n\nBraking performance is as superior as the rest of the car. It stops on a dime, a trite phrase, perhaps, but one that definitely applies. Nosedive is non-existent and the brakes are large- particularly the front ones, at 13.2 inches.\n\nWith power and ability far beyond that of normal automobiles, the super car in sedan clothing has its share of safety features. As you’d expect, anti-lock brakes as well as front and door-mounted side air-bags are standard.\n\nIn addition, the ca r comes with Brake Assis t, which detects how quickly the brake pedal is being applied and adjusts braking power accordingly. It also has side head impact protection, which works in conjunction with the side impact air bags. Traction control is also standard on this powerful rear-wheel-drive automobile. This is in addition to the Electronic Stability Program, which detects understeer or oversteer and keeps the vehicle on its intended course.\n\nRocketing down the highway is easy when ensconced in the comfort of the E55 cabin.\n\nAMG uses special trim, the test car having black leather trim with dark blue inserts. The seats were firm and supportive, although some may find them a little flat. They proved comfortable over the long haul. Black maple trim helped warm the interior. It’s exclusive to the E55.\n\nThe cabin is typical E-class, which means a nicely assembled interior and controls designed in the European idiom.\n\nThe dual zone automatic climate controls work well, allowing the passenger and driver to adjust the temperatures to their liking.\n\nThe face of the audio system pops open to reveal a cassette deck. An integrated weather band keeps you appraised of changing conditions. The station preset buttons double as the keypad for an optional cell phone — a nice design.\n\nThe only real down side to the interior was the cruise control stalk, which seems too easy to trip accidentally.\n\nBut that’s nit-picking, for this sedan has all the excellence that the E-Class provides in less powerful versions. To call it desirable is in an understatement. So is calling it seriously fast.\n\nIt’s also exceedingly rare.\n\nMercedes Benz plans to import only 2,000 of these rockets and they’re all spoken for. No wonder. With speed and agility far beyond mere mortal sedans, this car is one to remember. Even two decades from now.\n\n>> 1999 Mercedes Benz E55\n\nVehicle type: Large, luxury 4-door sedan\n\nEngines: 5.5-liter OHC V8\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nWheelbase: 111.5 inches\n\nLength: 189.4 inches\n\nCargo volume: 15.3 cubic feet\n\nTires: P245/40ZR-18 front, P275/ 35ZR-18 rear\n\nAcceleration: 0-60: 5.4 seconds\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 13 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium >>",

      "expert_review": "I almost had the perverse pleasure of turning away a Mercedes-Benz, but I didn’t want the driver to feel bad, so I took it in, like a stray pup. Through a scheduling mixup, the one that was sent was not the one I ordered; I had been hoping to test the new 8-cylinder, all-wheel-drive version of the E-Class sedan, but what they sent was a stinking 6-cylinder, rear-wheel-drive crate. Since it has been extensively reworked for the 2000 model year, I wasn’t TOO unhappy about spending a week in it, keeping my options open for a later look at the 4MATIC I had planned on.\n\nActually, it was a good thing, because frankly, I was dubious about the suitability of a six-cylinder engine for Mercedes’ bread-and-butter, mid-range car, which though it starts at a mere $47,100, becomes a $50K+ machine as quickly as you can say “moonroof, option package E2.” The rear-drive E320 derives its name from the 3.2-liter V-6 engine. Even in such basic form, the car weighs a hefty 3,700 pounds, leading to my concern over its having sand kicked in its face, especially with an automatic transmission the only gear-stirring option.\n\nAh, but those German horses are strong. The engine, with its three valves per cylinder, single overhead camshaft and dual sparkplugs makes 221 hp(@5,500 rpm) and 232 foot-pounds of torque, the latter available at anywhere from 3,000 to 4,800 rpm.\n\nThose numbers connote engine tuning mindful of American conditions, where “launch feel” and midrange flexibility are of far more moment than high all-day cruising speeds are in the land of its birth. (The old workhorse 3.0-liter inline six diesel is gone; the new shell design could not accommodate its height.)\n\nJust mashing the throttle and holding on, I consistently measured 0-60 times in the low-7-second range, which is plenty good for a luxury sedan, and would suffice for a sporty car. If you want to know how it feels to be shot out of a cannon, pony up another 20 large and they’ll put you in the E55, the hotrodded AMG variant which shaves a couple of seconds from the sprint time, thanks to its spirited 349 ponies.\n\nThat’s pretty far out. The E420 can give you the panache (and the lovely sound) of a V-8 for only about $5K more than the E320. But, given the (more than) adequacy of the V-6, and the present trend of gasoline prices, the E320 is certainly the more rational choice, which is more in line with the E-Class ethos.\n\nFor it is, after all, a four-door and a rather reserved looking one. The restyling was a matter of detail work; a casual observer might not notice unless old and new Es were parked side by side. The 2000 edition has a lower hood line, a smaller grille and lower headlamps cocked at a sharper angle, all inspired by the look of the CLK coupe. There are now air scoop cutouts for the front brakes, new rocker panels and body-colored door handles and side skirts. On the whole, it looks racier and cleaner. I noticed that the tops of the fenders seemed better defined, recalling Benzes past. One thing they didn’t mess with was the slickness of the shape – it still has a creditable drag coefficient of 0.29, impressive for a car that doesn’t require contortions to enter.\n\nA number of detail changes have been made inside, too, with upgraded carpets, headliner, instruments and (standard) leather upholstery, plus a trick borrowed from this country’s designers, a “multifunction” steering wheel with integrated radio and telephone controls. Everything inside looked elegant and was impeccably assembled. The flight deck afforded ample leg and head space, while the rear seats were rather cramped, not surprising given the 95-cubic-foot volume. The 15.3-c.f. trunk was generous for the class, and easily accessed.\n\nThe 3.2 engine is not the smoothest I’ve ever experienced, but they’ve certainly extracted unusually lusty sounds from it. It feels gutsy through most of its range and hardly seems breathless even as the ounter shoots toward 6,000.\n\nIt is mated to a superb five-speed automatic transmission first developed for the luxurious S-Class cars. It was quite intuitive, and could also be pushed around manually, too – a flick of the console-mounted lever to the left forces a downshift, to the right, an upshift. (Overrevving is electronically precluded by the engine management computer.) In attacking roads both good and bad, I kept coming back to one word: solidity. The chassis is rigid and so well screwed together, it might as well be a one-piece casting. The car feels unbreakable, and for all that, the ride isn’t even what I’d call firm. It’s a little this side of cushy, but not tiresome even over second-class roads.\n\nAll the frills aside (and they are legion), the handling and demeanor alone are convincing arguments for spending twice the current average transaction price for this car. A machine that invites performance driving had better be ready for the worst, too, and the E-Class is a virtual showcase for safety enhancements. Start, or rather, stop, with the brakes ­ good-sized four-wheel discs with antilock and M-B’s “brake assist system.” One of the many onboard computers monitors the speed with which the brake pedal is depressed, and if the actuation is swifter than normal, instantly signals the brakes to go to maximum pressure. In a car that is governed to 130 mph, milliseconds count. The system works well, and seemed able to discriminate between fast and very fast applications. The antilock mechanism was quiet and mannerly.\n\nThe E-Class now has Mercedes’ Electronic Stability Program standard, in addition to the all-speed traction control which keeps the rear wheels from spinning when they lack grip. ESP uses selective braking and throttle intervention to try to keep the car going where the driver intends; yaw sensors determine whether the car is drifting from the intended line and send appropriate instructions to the brake and engine management systems. It can be deactivated if you like to get the rear end loose.\n\nShould the active safety mechanisms prove unavailing, Es come with front air bags, of course, as well as door-mounted side air bags and, for the first time, curtain side air bags that deploy from the ceiling in a side impact or rollover situation. Activated in a 40th of a second, these air-filled cushions are six feet long, 14 inches high and two inches thick (see photo above). They not only reduce impact force on occupants’ heads and necks, they deter glass splinters and the like.\n\nI was having too much fun driving the car to play much with the COMAND system, which offers color LCD screen control of radio and air conditioner functions, plus a Global Positioning System navigation display, but it seemed – much as I love digital stuff – an unnecessarily cumbersome and distracting way of adjusting radio and air conditioning systems. The navigational aspects were interesting, though, tra cing routes fairly well in my area down to street level.\n\nEPA estimates are 21 mpg city, 30 highway. With quite a bit of swift freeway cruising in addition to some gridlock work, I got 27.2, which mitigates the powerplant’s predilection for premium fuel. I did not get the window sticker from the exact car I tested, but can reconstruct it approximately. As noted, base price suggested is $47,100; metallic paint, $610; option package E2, $1,575 (this gets you a Bose stereo upgrade, power moonroof and sensor-activated wipers); COMAND system, $1,995; heated front seats ($610). Factor in luxury tax and freight, and you have $53,535.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class mid-size luxury car is offered in sedan, wagon, coupe and convertible body styles. It offers a range of engines, including performance powertrains in the AMG variants. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and the E-Class competes against cars like the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Lexus GS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe E350 sedan replaces the E300 and features a slightly more powerful 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. All variants now have standard blind spot warning and keyless access and starting. Coupe and convertible versions now have standard heated front seats, wireless device charging, satellite radio with a six-month trial, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a Burmester premium stereo.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe E-Class offers advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking and steering assistance, and it has the capability of warning other cars with its Car-to-X technology. The range of body styles should help you find a version that’s right for your needs, and high-powered AMG versions bump up the performance for driving enthusiasts. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nIf you want a stylish mid-size luxury car that drives well, has a first-rate cabin and is packed with technology, the E-Class should meet your needs. However, it can get pricey with options, and the optional air suspension might be too firm for some people.",

      "expert_review": "A long, late-night drive home is not nearly so troubling with the proper car, and recently that car was the 2004 Mercedes-Benz E500 4Matic. The E-Class is the midsized Mercedes sedan, larger than the C-Class, smaller than the S-Class.\n\nIf there’s a serious problem with the E500, it’s that it’s so nicely executed that I can’t imagine why I would spend an extra $22,000 or so for the $86,970 Mercedes S500 4Matic.\n\nYes, the E500 4Matic isn’t cheap, with a base price exceeding $58,000 and a total price as tested of $65,200.\n\nThe S-Class is about a foot longer than the E-Class, but the E seems very much the right size: plenty of room in the back seat, a big trunk and small enough to navigate city traffic. The 4Matic feature is Mercedes’ name for all-wheel-drive, meaning all four wheels are powered, not just the rear wheels, as on non-4Matic Mercedes models.\n\nThe 4Matic adds about $2,500 to the price of the regular E500, and it also means that you must forgo the E500’s neat seven-speed automatic transmission for a five-speed automatic. But the extra grip that all-wheel-drive provides, particularly on slick pavement, is worth it.\n\nWith no options, the E500 4Matic is exceptionally well-equipped, with leather upholstery, walnut trim, an air-controlled suspension, 17-inch tires and alloy wheels and a 10-speaker stereo with CD player. The safety equipment included is even more extensive: side and side-curtain air bags, an electronic anti-lock braking system with brake assist, electronic stability control, the TeleAid emergency communications system (similar to General Motors’ OnStar) and a security system.\n\nOptions included a $950 Harman/Kardon stereo upgrade, a $1,410 appearance package, $1,500 for a sunroof and rear- and side-window blinds, $780 for upgraded front seats, and $490 for a push-button “electronic trunk closer.” The E500 4Matic also gets hit with a $1,300 “gas guzzler” tax, though fuel mileage – 16 miles per gallon in the city, 20 mpg on the highway – isn’t horrible.\n\nOn the road, the E500 is quiet and rock-solid. Seats are excellent. Two quibbles: The “speed sensitive” power steering lacks feel, and although the overall weight of about 3,800 pounds isn’t excessive, the car feels much heavier in sharp corner. On a long, late-night drive home, though, not much of that matters.\n\nThe E500 4Matic is a car for all seasons.\n\nBase price: $58,050.\n\nPrice as tested: $65,200.\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 20 highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, all-wheel-drive luxury sedan with a 5.0-liter, 302-horsepower V-8 with a 5-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "It’s what Mercedes’ E320 Bluetec doesn’t have that makes it worthy: There’s no knock, no smell.\n\nIt hasn’t received nearly the attention or the adoration given the Toyota Prius, but in its own way, the 2007 Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec is advancing the cause of fuel conservation in a way that is every bit as dramatic as the Prius hybrid.\n\nUpon its introduction, the Mercedes E320 Bluetec, the cleanest diesel car engine ever, began showing much of America what the rest of the world has known for a long time: Diesel engines have advanced to the point where they deserve a place at the table. If we agree there is not one solution to a reduction in oil usage but several, the diesel will be just as important as the gasoline/electric hybrid.\n\nOutside, the E320 looks like any other Mercedes. The mid-sized E-Class, mildly redesigned for 2007 and essentially unchanged for 2008, has long been Mercedes’ bread-and-butter car, delivering luxury, safety and five-passenger capacity at a moderately affordable price.\n\nThe base model of the E-Class is the E350, powered by a gasoline 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 horsepower. The E320 Bluetec — “Bluetec” is the name Mercedes chose for this engine’s technology — is a 3.0- liter diesel V-6 with a turbocharger. Horsepower is 208, but torque, the measure of pulling power, is a trucklike 388 pound-feet.\n\nWhile 208 horsepower doesn’t sound like much, this engine, thanks in part to the turbocharger and an excellent seven-speed automatic transmission, accelerates like a V-8. Look in the rear-view mirror: no smoke. Turn off the stereo and roll down the window: no diesel clatter.\n\nThe best part, though, is the economics. At a base price of $51,550, the E320 Bluetec lists for just $1,000 more than a gas-powered E350. But with an average of seven miles per gallon better fuel economy, the E320 can make up that difference in fuel savings rather quickly. With a Toyota Prius listing for more than $5,000 over a comparable Toyota Corolla, it would be years before the average owner would see an overall cost benefit resulting from the Prius’ more modest thirst.\n\nIt’s a little surprising that Mercedes can sell the E320 Bluetec for this price, as there’s a lot of sophisticated technology in the engine controlling the smoke and pollution that we associate with last-generation diesels. Indeed, higher compression ratios and other aspects of the working diesel mean that the engines must be built to a more heavy-duty standard. Is Mercedes subsidizing the Bluetec to help jump-start diesels in the U.S.? They aren’t talking, but it seems likely. That said, in many parts of the world, diesels account for more than half of Mercedes production, so it isn’t as though they don’t know how to mass-produce these engines.\n\nSo just how economical is it? The 2007 model is EPA rated at 26 mpg city, 35 mpg highway, with an overall average of 30 mpg. But you likely know that for 2008, the EPA has revised the way it measures fuel economy to better reflect real-world driving. Now, on the mileage test loop, they accelerate quicker, use the air conditioner, and spend some time in cold temperatures. The result is that the EPA figures for 2008, in almost every case, are substantially lower than for 2007. The E320 Bluetec that had 2007 ratings of 26/35, has 2008 ratings of 23/32, with overall mileage of 26.\n\nSimilarly, the gas-powered E350 drops too, from 2007 numbers of 19 mpg city, 26 mpg highway, to 17/24. The E350’s overall mileage is now 19 mpg, still 7 mpg behind the Bluetec.\n\nThat said, after a week of reasonably conservative driving, I averaged 30.2 mpg in an E320 Bluetec.\n\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of all this is that while I’m getting more than 30 mpg, I’m giving up absolutely nothing. The E-Class’ excellent ride and nimble handling remain, as do the safety features that come standard, including a TeleAid emergency communications system, side and side-curtain airbags, electronic stability control and antilock brakes with brake assist. Luxury features include burl walnut trim, an excellent Harman/Kardon stereo and a sunroof, plus options that added leather upholstery, a DVD-based navigation system, heated seats, xenon headlights, a larger “panorama” sunroof and Sirius satellite radio. The base price of $51,550 rose to $61,025 with those options and shipping, but that’s still a competitive price for a car such as this.\n\nNew technology and the availability of much-cleaner diesel fuel means we’ll be seeing more manufacturers introducing diesel cars and light trucks in the next two years. But the current benchmark is the E320 Blue-tec, and I don’t see that changing soon.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was updated Jan. 4, 2021, to add our impressions of the 2021 Mercedes-Benz E450 coupe.\n\nThe verdict: It will cost you a pretty penny, but the revised 2021 E-Class continues to be the standard by which other mid-size luxury cars are judged — few brands make a finer automobile than this.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s a cutthroat segment, but the E-Class is the benchmark in it, with the most luxurious interior in the mid-size luxury class, highly competitive powertrains and better technology than most. \n\nMercedes-Benz’s mid-size luxury car is the E-Class. Globally, it’s one of the company’s most popular models, available in a number of different body styles — from the sedans you see here to a wagon, a coupe, a convertible, a high-performance model and even a new lifted off-road wagon in the vein of a Audi Allroad, Subaru Outback or Volvo V90 Cross Country. For 2021, the E-Class gets a few updates to keep it in line with the rest of the brand’s showroom. We took a refreshed E450 4Matic sedan and high-performance E63 S for a spin to see what the updates for the ’21 model year have done to keep the E-Class fresh, and then followed up with an E450 4Matic coupe.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: New Face, New Wagon\n\nUnderstated Good Looks\n\nFrom a styling standpoint, you’d be forgiven if you have trouble spotting the 2021 model over the 2020. The differences are subtle, and mostly limited to the front and rear styling. The front gets new headlights, a new grille, new bumper and new hood, all meant to link the E-Class with the company’s SUV styling. This is the same look we can see on the GLA, GLC, GLE and GLS SUVs, and now it’s appearing on the company’s cars as well. There are some new wheel patterns, including on my test E450 that wore the lovely black 19-inch optional rollers Mercedes slapped an AMG badge on so it can charge more money. Out back, there are new taillights with new LED patterns, but overall the styling changes to the car aren’t huge. That’s OK; there’s nothing ostentatious or offensive in the design, and while it’s not exactly all that distinctive, it is clean, safe and respectable, which is generally what the buyers of the E-Class tend to be looking for in a luxury sedan. \n\nStill the Luxury Benchmark\n\nThe changes to the inside are similarly subtle, and generally revolve around new equipment and technology instead of styling. First off, the twin 12.3-inch digital screens are now standard on all E-Class models, providing a reconfigurable instrument cluster behind the wheel and a touch panel control display to the right of that. It’s running the latest MBUX multimedia system, featuring an expanded list of voice controls, gesture controls and an optional augmented reality feature for the standard navigation system that throws digital arrows up over a real-time video display of what’s in front of you. \n\nThe biggest interior changes come in two areas: the steering wheel and its relation to some new features for the semi-autonomous driving systems. First, the wheel: This new three-spoke model has expanded capacitive-touch-sensitive areas on the spokes to control various functions of the gauge cluster, cruise control and multimedia system. I have to say I wasn’t a big fan of the last-generation wheel because it was much too easy to brush against the sensitive controllers and change a display, or switch tracks, or adjust volume … and this new wheel is no better. In fact, it may be worse, as there are now more areas of the steering wheel you simply cannot touch unless you intend to change something. Mercedes-Benz is forcing you to maintain absolutely proper hand-position on the rim of the steering wheel — no steering via the spokes and no resting your hand there, either. Gotta keep it at 10 and 2, folks.\n\nThe changes to the semi-autonomous driving systems now rely more on you having your hands on the rim of the wheel. Previously, when you activated Mercedes-Benz’s active steering and lane-keeping systems that steer the vehicle at highway speeds, you weren’t able to take your hands off the wheel for any great length of time before the car would yell at you to make some minor steering adjustment to prove you were still actively engaged in the driving experience. This differs from systems like Tesla’s Autopilot or Cadillac’s Super Cruise that allow for hands-free driving, but Mercedes wasn’t quite ready to allow you to do that yet. For 2021, you no longer have to make periodic steering inputs to prove that you’re awake and paying attention, but you do have to keep your hands on the wheel. A sensor in the steering wheel rim detects if you’re touching it or not; that’s apparently now enough for the active steering systems to allow them to keep steering on the highway.\n\nThe rest of the interior is pretty much the same opulent, high-end luxury cabin we’ve enjoyed on the E-Class for years now. The leather trim looks, smells and feels rich; the switches all move with a mechanical precision; and there isn’t an overwhelming push toward touch-sensitive panels (aside from the frustrating steering wheel controls). But perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this E450’s cabin is the quietness: My test car had an optional Acoustic Comfort Package, which ups the amount of sound insulation in the body and changes out the glass for acoustically absorbent types, and the results are amazing. Cruising along back roads at 50 mph, the loudest thing you hear are the optional ventilated seat fans. There’s almost no wind noise at all, very little powertrain noise and only the faintest of bumps and rumbles from the tires. This isolation contributes greatly to the overall luxury experience of the E-Class and is worth every penny of the $1,100 that Mercedes-Benz charges for this package.\n\nChoose Your Path: Smooth and Quiet …\n\nYou’d think that this isolation would make the E-Class boring to drive, but that’s not the case. It’s a paragon of automotive refinement and perhaps one of the best examples of the stereotypical German luxury sedan on the road today. The base car is actually the rear-wheel-drive E350, powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 255 horsepower. Our test sedan and coupe, however, were both a step up from that: the mid-level E450 4Matic. It’s powered by a super smooth turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a formidable 362 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The engine is augmented by a mild-hybrid system that Mercedes-Benz calls EQ Boost, essentially a hefty starter-generator that runs on the E-Class’ 48-volt electrical system, and can add as much as 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque in sudden on-demand bursts. That means that this E450 is both smooth and quick when it needs to be, with Mercedes-Benz quoting a 0-60-mph time of 5.2 seconds for the rear-wheel-drive coupe, and 4Matic all-wheel drive shaving it down to 4.9 seconds for the coupe and sedan. The 4Matic system helps keep traction at its maximum, and shifting duty is handled by the flawless nine-speed automatic transmission. Our test cars featured the optional Air Body Control air suspension system, which allows for more adjustability in the various drive modes that the car offers.\n\nThose drive modes do make a difference when combined with the air suspension. In the softest comfort mode, the E450 glides over surface imperfections without disturbing occupants but still maintains decent body roll control on curvy roads. Flip it into Sport or Sport Plus modes and the ride firms up, the steering gets heavier, and the throttle becomes much more responsive. It’s as if the E450 has two distinct personalities: a relaxed grand touring sedan that’s happy to coddle its passengers as it eats up mile after highway mile, and an entertaining European sports sedan with plenty of immediate, on-demand torque, beautifully balanced steering and a communicative chassis. But make no mistake, the E450 is definitely skewed toward the luxury end of the class, with its emphasis more on being comfortable for its occupants than being some kind of aggressive sports sedan. Even though coupes have a sportier reputation and the E450 4Matic coupe’s wheelbase is shorter than the sedan’s by 2.6 inches, it rides as comfortably and has the same dual personality. In fact, the biggest practical difference we found in the coupe was a smaller but surprisingly accommodating backseat that’s usable by any adult who’s willing to make the effort to get in and out of it — and it is an effort, despite front seats that motor forward to clear the way.\n\n… or Big and Boisterous\n\nNow, if you want an E-Class that’s meant to be a driver’s car, you’ll likely instead want this: the new Mercedes-AMG E63 S. It’s the hot performance version of the E-Class, swapping out the already powerful and responsive six-cylinder for a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine pumping out a massive 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a nine-speed Speedshift automatic transmission with electronic clutch replacing a traditional torque converter, and it sends power to all four wheels via Mercedes’ 4Matic AWD system. The suspension is a sport-tuned version of the Air Body Control system, and AMG included all kinds of other parts to help the E63 go fast, such as a performance exhaust system, special AMG drive modes, an electronic rear limited-slip differential and even dynamic motor mounts to help the car’s weight balance and distribution in hard-driving situations. \n\nThe result is an absolute beast, the Mr. Hyde to the lesser E450’s Dr. Jekyll — a four-door muscle car that rumbles and roars like a barroom brawler, but that can dance like a prizefighting boxer. Mercedes-Benz estimates that the E63 S can rocket from 0-60 mph in just 3.3 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 186 mph, and it only takes a few stabs at the accelerator to realize this isn’t meritless boasting. The E63’s ride is firmer than the E450, and of course the whole car is significantly louder (despite having an optional acoustic glass comfort package), from the exhaust note to the tire noise, but that’s just expected when you turn the craziness dial up to 11 as AMG has done here. \n\nDriving through the suburbs at lower cruising speeds, the specially tuned nine-speed Speedshift AMG transmission isn’t the smoothest operator. But when roads get curvy, it’s an absolute riot. The steering requires some effort but rewards you with precision and excellent feedback. The optional carbon-ceramic brakes feel strong enough to pull the color out of your irises if you stomp on them hard enough, and they’ll do it all day long with no fade at all — and most amazingly, with no low-speed, cold-brake squeal like other carbon-ceramic systems. I never had the opportunity to explore the E63’s new Drift Mode, as such things are best left to racetracks, but the fact that the car actually has such an electronic function speaks to its mission of being a hooligan in a matte-gray suit.\n\n… Ah yes, that matte paint. It’s one of the Designo Magno paint options for the E63, and it’s not really something I enjoy. To me, it looks as if Mercedes-Benz primered a perfectly lovely E63 and then forgot to apply the actual paint. It’s also something of a maintenance hog because you can’t wax it, but you also have to be careful washing it. No automated brush car washes (touchless only), no polishes, and don’t even rub it too hard with a towel lest you create a shiny spot. It’s not the only visual difference between the E63 and lesser E-Class models: The bodywork is different, featuring a new front end with all-LED headlights and a new grille and lower bumper that look a lot more aggressive than the E450. The E63 also has a wider body with flared wheel arches to cover the bigger wheels and tires, plus a revised rear end for 2021. This one comes with the optional Night Package, which brings high-gloss black trim like the front splitter, mirror housings, fender inserts, window frame trim and more.\n\nThings are equally amped up inside with the big news again being the new steering wheel — but a different one than the E450 has. In the E63 S, it has twin horizontal spokes but the same revised capacitive-touch-sensitive controls that mean you can only really hold the wheel by the rim when driving. The AMG wheel also has two rotary button controllers to change all sorts of settings from drive mode to exhaust function to ESP deactivation. They’re convenient, as they don’t require you to go hunting through various menus to change some settings or quickly activate or deactivate various systems, and I have to admit they also look pretty cool at the bottom of the steering wheel. The rest of the interior is just as nice as any other E-Class, but it comes with even more luxurious appointments, such as standard Nappa leather covering aggressively bolstered sport seats and optional carbon-fiber trim.\n\nExceptional Products Don’t Come Cheap\n\nNone of this technological excellence comes cheap, of course. The E-Class is not the price leader in its segment, but that’s true of most Mercedes-Benz models. The base price for the least expensive E350 in the sedan lineup starts at $55,300 (all prices include destination). Our E450 4Matic sedan was a step up from that and starts at $63,050, but all manner of option packages and electronic goodies saw that price climb on our tester to an eye-popping $81,950. There’s an E53 sedan if you want some of the go-fast goodies that AMG offers ($74,950 to start), but the big daddy E63 S test car we enjoyed starts at a whopping $108,550 before all the options were added. After those options were tallied up, the total manufacturer’s asking price for our E63 S test car was a lofty $136,290. Ouch.\n\nThe coupe will cost you more than the sedan, on different grounds. For one thing, it starts at the E450 level, not the E350, so even though it has rear-wheel drive standard, its $66,000 base price is well above the E350 sedan’s $55,300. But even if you choose the optional 4Matic, the E450 coupe is $68,500, premium-priced over the $63,050 E450 4Matic sedan. As with the sedan, our test coupe was optioned up to $78,580.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s time to talk diesel. The catalyst is the Mercedes-Benz E320 CDI turbodiesel sedan.\n\nThe E320 has a distinctly German personality. The ride is firm, the handling is tight, and the brakes are powerful. But it’s the diesel engine that makes it feel most like a European Mercedes.\n\nThe diesel E-Class is an excellent example of why diesels are so popular in Europe. The engine has a fuel mileage rating of 23 city and 37 highway. With 369 pound-feet of torque, it scoots to 60 miles per hour in 6.6 seconds.\n\nIn years past, diesel engines were often criticized for being loud, sooty and crude. Those days are long gone, and today’s diesels are clean, relatively quiet and about 20 to 30 percent more efficient than a gasoline engine. They also emit less carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide than a gasoline engine, although the levels of nitrogen oxides and unburned\n\nhydrocarbons are higher. Oxidation catalysts in the exhaust system and exhaust gas recirculation bring these figures back in line.\n\nA diesel engine is the powertrain of choice in Europe. European diesel fuel is lower in sulfur than the fuel sold here, but that is changing. The Environmental Protection Agency has mandated that low-sulfur diesel fuel be available through retailers by Oct. 15. With higher-quality fuel, more companies, especially European ones, will import diesel engines.\n\nIn 1893 in Augsburg, Germany, Rudolf Diesel invented the engine that now bears his name. It was a single cylinder powered by peanut oil, and his engine won a grand prize in 1900 at the World’s Fair in Paris. In 1912, Diesel said “the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today, but such oils may become, in the course of time, as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time.” Now, nearly 100 years later, those words reveal Diesel’s visionary thinking.\n\nBiodiesel is fuel made from soybeans, rapeseed or even recycled fryer oil. As an alternative to fossil fuel, biodiesel could one day lead us to trucks and buses that are powered with a blend of biodiesel fuel made from soybeans, rapeseed or even recycled fryer oil.\n\nLast weekend, Audi won the 12 Hours of Sebring with a V-12 diesel-powered sports racer, a car that will compete in the 24 Hours of LeMans in France in June.\n\nThe 3.2-liter, inline six-cylinder engine in the E320 has four valves per cylinder, dual overhead camshafts and a common-rail direct injection system. Direct injection sprays fuel into each cylinder instead of into an intake manifold.\n\nMercedes also uses a variable nozzle on the turbocharger and a water-cooled intercooler.\n\nMercedes discovered that injecting a small quantity of fuel twice in advance of the main injection smooths the combustion process and reduces noise. The CDI is only slightly louder than a gasoline engine.\n\nThe beauty of a diesel engine is its ability to generate higher torque than a gasoline engine. Torque is the force responsible for turning the wheels and moving the vehicle, so a vehicle with high torque accelerates quickly. The E320 steps away from a stop with considerable authority.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission adapts to the driver’s style. It also holds gears longer while climbing or descending hills. It can also be shifted manually.\n\nThe test car’s cabin was warm and inviting, due in large measure to the woodgrain trim that was sprinkled across the dash, console and door panels. The seats are firm, and those in front, particularly, provide good support. Rear-seat legroom is adequate but not overly generous.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $51,050. Options included metallic paint, leather seats, heated front seats and bi-xenon headlights. The sticker price was $55,715.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter, 201-hp 6-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 120 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,160 lbs.\n\nBase price: $51,050\n\nAs driven: $55,715\n\nMPG rating: 23 city, 37 hwy. At A Glance\n\nPoint: The diesel engine gives the E320 strong acceleration and good fuel economy. The engine is quiet and clean, with no soot from the exhaust.\n\nCounterpoint: Diesel fuel is not available at every station, so you have to refuel well before your gauge gets to empty.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is available in four body styles and has a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder, six-cylinder and V-8 powertrains. The E350 has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 255 horsepower and the E450 gets a 362-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder. The high-performance AMG E53 has a 429-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder, while the line-topping AMG E63 boasts a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 with 603 hp. Stately and refined, the E350 and E450 blend a silky ride with reasonably sporty handling. The E450 All-Terrain wagon adds a modicum of off-road capability via an adjustable air suspension and SUV-style lower body cladding. The range-topping AMG models are outrageously quick, but they command commensurately lofty prices. E-Class rivals include the Audi A6,  BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Lexus ES.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class arrives in its many permutations with no significant updates or changes. A redesigned E-Class is slated to debut for the 2024 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nDual-zone climate control\nHands-free trunk lid\nHeated front seats\nTwo USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n360-degree parking camera  system\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\n23-speaker Burmester audio system\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAMG sport exhaust\nPower soft-close doors\nHeated rear seats\nInterior air purifier\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class should definitely make the shopping list of someone looking for a posh mid-size luxury vehicle. It offers a good balance between ride quality and handling even if a little more sparkle in terms of steering feel would be a welcome addition. The standard turbo four is perfectly fine in terms of acceleration and economy, but the silky nature of the turbo six-cylinder and extra grip from the available all-wheel-drive system are smart upgrades. Yes, the twin-turbo V-8 is a blast, but its high price and thirst for fuel are significant hurdles.",

      "expert_review": "On the very day when oil has risen to a new high of about $64 a barrel — the same day President Bush signed a $12.3 billion energy bill that is supposed to help lessen our dependence on petroleum — I am driving around in a car that is EPA-rated at 14 mpg in the city. It’s a station wagon with a little rear-facing flip-up seat in the back that is just right for twin adolescents, meaning this car can carry seven people.\n\nCarry them from zero to 150 mph in 24 seconds.\n\nCar pool running late? The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG Sport Wagon might be just the ticket.\n\nThe absurdity of this vehicle — a 469-horsepower station wagon! — is not lost on me. I am also aware that the news media are under special scrutiny, expected to act responsibly and perhaps even lead by example. My Mercedes and I might well be leading us all into some horrible cursed afterlife, where angelic members of the Sierra Club will laugh and point down from fluffy white clouds as we gas-sinners crawl through an endless desert, red plastic cans at our sides, begging for just one more gallon of premium.\n\nIn my defense, I drove a Honda Civic Hybrid last week. Even so, multiple readers who were Civic Hybrid owners took me to task for not getting the advertised miles-per-gallon. “I can’t imagine how you could get 38.3 mpg with this car, unless it was on a racetrack,” one wrote. He gets 52 mpg.\n\nTo him I say: Thanks! Your stalwart efforts at conservation allowed me to feel not so bad about driving the E55 Sport Wagon all week: If I’m averaging 16 mpg, and you are averaging 52 mpg, then together we are averaging 34 mpg. Teamwork! And hang in there, because next week, I get a Ford F-350 heavy-duty pickup truck that will make this Mercedes look like a Toyota Prius.\n\nAnyway, back to me and my 469 horsepower. There is nothing like 469 horses that will make you feel younger, slimmer, more clever and genuinely in touch with The Beautiful People. Painted “Brilliant Silver” and all hunkered down on fat 18-inch tires and wheels, it looks sort of sinister. Inside, I have ventilated and massaging front seats, so what do I care? If I would feel guilty about the gas I was using, I would have to feel guilty about all the nappas that died to supply the creamy leather, or the stand of birdseye maple trees that were felled for the interior trim. Right? Right! I don’t know what Rush Limbaugh drives, or even if he does, but it’s probably a car like this. There’s even room for Robert Novak in the back!\n\nOn the road, the E55 Sport Wagon handles so much better than its 4,087 pounds would suggest. Even so, the ride is commendably smooth and so quiet you could hear Novak muttering barnyard epithets from the rear seat. The car’s 5.5-liter V-8 is similarly smooth, but once you hit the throttle, the engine takes you seriously. Its five-speed automatic transmission isn’t as deft as Mercedes’ seven-speed auto, but that transmission isn’t beefy enough for this engine’s torque. Buttons on the back of the steering wheel allow you to shift manually if you prefer.\n\nThe E55 Sport Wagon has most every safety feature invented, with doors that sound like bank vaults when you close them, and seams and joints and body panels that line up exactly right. The E-Class is not a new car, but I’m not sure how the next-generation E55 Sport Wagon could be much better.\n\nAnd it likely won’t be cheaper. This one starts at $82,500, and with options, shipping and a mea culpa “gas-guzzler” tax of $1,700, the bottom line is $90,505.\n\nThere are cheaper station wagons — heck, pretty much all of them are cheaper — but none will make a statement as this one does.\n\nWhat that statement is, I don’t know. But I like the sound of it.\n\n– – –\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.\n\n– – –\n\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\n\nBase price: $82,500\n\nPrice as tested: $90,505\n\nEPA rating: 14 mpg city, 21 mpg highway\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive station wagon with a 5.5-liter, 469-horsepower supercharged V-8 with a 5-speed automatic transmission",

      "expert_review": "A diesel engine used to mean hard starts, black smoke and a clattering engine. Not so anymore.\n\nThe new generation of direct-injection diesels is quieter and cleaner than ever. Witness the Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec. Its base price of $54,200 is only $1,000 more than the gasoline model, an amount that would be saved in fuel costs in a relatively short time.\n\nThe E320 Bluetec is a good example of how modern diesels have evolved. The 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 cranks out a modest 210 horsepower, but 400 pound-feet of torque. Torque is what you feel through the seat of your pants when you punch the throttle, and in most driving situations it is more important than horsepower.\n\nMercedes points out that the engine delivers the power of a V-8 with the fuel economy of a four-cylinder. The E320 Bluetec accelerates to 60 miles per hour in 6.6 seconds, a time that is easily on par with its gasoline sibling. On top of that, the Bluetec diesel is 20 to 30 percent more efficient. Its fuel mileage is rated at 23 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway. With a range of 675 miles, it can drive from Kansas City to Denver without stopping for fuel.\n\nIn terms of emissions, the Bluetec is 50-state legal. Emissions are controlled by a catalytic converter, and a particulate filter removes any trace of black smoke from the exhaust. The injection of a urea solution called AdBlue into the exhaust is a key component to making the emissions meet the most stringent requirements. AdBlue chemically converts nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water. AdBlue is stored in a small tank and is refilled at each 10,000-mile service interval.\n\nHigh-tech diesel engines also produce 20 to 30 percent less carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide than a comparable gasoline engine.\n\nThe E320 has a distinctly German personality. The ride is firm, the handling is tight, and the brakes are powerful. The test car’s cabin was warm and inviting, due in large measure to the wood-grain trim that was sprinkled across the dash, console and door panels. The seats are firm, and those in front, particularly, provide good support. Rear-seat legroom is adequate but not overly generous.\n\nThe Comand system for operating the navigation and audio system is not as easy to use as it is on newer models with a central mouselike controller.\n\nThe redesigned 2010 E-class, introduced this week at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland, will have both coupe and sedan models.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $54,200. Options included the navigation system, heated front seats, power rear window shade and HD Sirius satellite radio. The sticker price was $59,065.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n2009 Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter, 210-hp 6-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 112.4 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,860 lbs.\n\nBase price: $54,200\n\nAs driven: $59,065\n\nMPG rating: 23 city, 32 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNo changes are visible for 2002 except for new wheels on the E320  the lower-powered version of the series that continues to be the most popular Mercedes-Benz model in North America. The group also includes the E430 sedan and a performance-oriented E55 AMG sedan. Germanys AMG is the premium builder of high-performance Mercedes-Benz models.\n\nFace-lifted for the 2000 model year, the E-Class comes as a four-door sedan or an E320 wagon. Each can be equipped with either the standard rear-drive or optional 4MATIC all-wheel drive. The sedan is slotted between the C-Class sedan and the top-rung, four-door S-Class. Rivals include the Acura RL, Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Cadillac Seville, Infiniti Q45 and Lexus LS 430. In other words, the E-Class targets the heart of the luxury sedan market.\n\nMercedes Tele Aid telematics system now offers expanded concierge-type services, including travel and sports/entertainment ticket reservations. Tele Aid operates on its own cellular phone system to summon emergency help using an SOS button, call Mercedes roadside assistance or track a stolen vehicle. If an airbag deploys, help is sought automatically. The system can also provide remote diagnostics and emergency door unlocking.\n\nExterior\nThe E-Class sedan measures 189.4 inches long overall and sits on a 111.5-inch wheelbase. It is a bit longer than its archival, BMWs 5 Series, and is about 7 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. A sloping grille and slanted oval headlights are neatly integrated into the front end, in what Mercedes calls visionary styling. An available Sport Package for the E320 and E430 includes AMG aero enhancements, projector fog lamps and 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nA designo Silver Edition now has a single-tone Charcoal Nappa interior. Leather-upholstered seating for five occupants is provided. But like many of todays cars, the E-Class is better suited for two adults in the backseat, or a four-person capacity. In addition, a wide driveshaft tunnel makes the center rear seat appropriate for just short trips. With a 15.3-cubic-foot capacity, the trunk has a wide, flat floor and useful side wells that can hold small items.\n\nA standard COMAND (Cockpit Management and Data) system controls a satellite-based navigation system, the sound system and an optional telephone in three ways: via voice commands, buttons on the steering wheel, or controls positioned around a dashboard display screen. Buyers can elect to add InfoServices, which provides customized news headlines, stock quotes, sports scores, weather forecasts and other services via the Internet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe E320 is equipped with a 221-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6 engine, and the E430 comes with a 275-hp, 4.3-liter V-8. A 349-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 engine propels the limited-production, high-performance E55 AMG sedan. All models have a five-speed Touch Shift automatic transmission that incorporates a manual-shift mode for use whenever desired. Mercedes permanently engaged all-wheel-drive system, named 4MATIC, is available for the E320 and E430 sedan, but the E55 AMG is rear-drive only.\n\nMercedes claims that the E320 sedan accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds, vs. 5.4 seconds for the high-performance E55 AMG.\n\nSafety\nAll models have Mercedes Electronic Stability Program, antilock brakes and traction control. Brake Assist applies full braking force during an abrupt stop.\n\nTwo types of airbags go into the E-Class sedan, in addition to the federally required front airbags, which deploy at one of two levels depending on impact speed and crash severity. Curtain-type airbags protect the heads of occupants, and side-impact airbags are mounted in each of the four doors.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Some people think a German luxury sedan should be fast, handle harshly and just generally be a big race car. I don’t. I think a German luxury sedan should make you feel bad for not dressing up to drive it; you should want to wear a tie when you’re behind the wheel. It should not only be comfortable, it should be composed. For me, driving a car like this isn’t about screaming through the countryside like an idiot, it’s about driving down the road comfortably in a car that’s ready for any conditions that come your way.\n\nWith this as the benchmark, the Mercedes E-Class succeeds.\n\nI tested the all-wheel-drive E350 4Matic during an icy, dark and dreary Chicago week. It performed very well in these conditions, including a variety of short city trips and a long, backcountry drive to some ski trails. It had its share of quirks — notably some odd steering personality, as well as some lag in acceleration — but overall I think it’s one of the better luxury vehicles I’ve driven.\n\nExterior\nThe E-Class was redesigned for 2010, and I’m not a huge fan of the new look. It trades the rounded edges and quad headlights I liked from the previous model for a more angular, sharper look. It blends in with the crowd so well that I think if you took off the Mercedes-Benz badges, you’d have a hard time telling exactly what brand of car it was. That wasn’t the case with the previous version of the E-Class — it practically screamed “Mercedes-Benz.”\n\nThat’s not to say it’s an ugly car now — it’s not — it’s just traded its identity. Don’t believe me? Check out this comparison of the 2009 and 2010 Mercedes-Benz E-Class here.\n\nInterior\nThe inside got an immediate thumbs-up from me. Our test car came with black ash wood trim, which looks a million times better than any brown wood trim. The car featured in the pictures to the right are of an E550 we had in the office earlier, and the more I look at them, the more convinced I am that the darker trim is the way to go.\n\nThe beige leather was also nice, and not only for its color. It felt just a bit stiff — like a baseball glove that’s not quite broken in: soft, but not smooshy — simply perfect. The seats also adjusted about every way imaginable. Our tester came with an optional two-stage massage system that I really liked; it works your entire spine, rather than just lamely inflating one section of the lumbar support. Note: On its most intense setting, the massage is firm, so — well, you’ve been warned.\n\nOne odd thing was the placement of the analog clock in the gauge cluster, just to the left of the speedometer. That’s normally where I expect to see a tachometer, but I eventually got used to it.\n\nDriving\nMy biggest issue was with the E350’s stiff accelerator pedal. I did most of my driving on icy roads, and that’s not where you want to be abrupt with the gas pedal. Thing is, the pedal was so stiff it was hard to fine-tune just how much acceleration you wanted.\n\nAlso, the acceleration was OK, but it’s a weaker point in the E350 4Matic than in, say, the more powerful E550. Put another way, the E350 is capable, even with the heavy 4Matic hardware, but the E550 is quick. You notice it most when charging up on-ramps or passing on the highway, but even around town the V-6 feels short on low-end oomph compared with the V-8.\n\nAnother shortcoming: The steering is heavy at low speeds, then lightens up quickly. It’s as if it feels like it doesn’t want to turn, then it wants to turn too much. Some other variable-ratio power-steering systems — and some all-wheel-drive vehicles I’ve driven — do this, and I don’t like it. It makes the steering vague, and I don’t think it inspires confidence in parking maneuvers. The system is actually quite good on the highway, and I’m not sure why it can’t be as good in parking lots as it is there.\n\nThe high point of driving the E350 is its ride. Mercedes has come up with a suspension that offers a comfortable ride over rough pavement — even with our E350’s Sport Package, which adds 18-inch wheels — yet still manages to feel firm when you go through turns. Other reviewers who’ve driven both the E350 and the E550 say the E550 is even better in this regard. I’d be hard-pressed to imagine how, given the excellent quality of the E350’s ride.\n\nFinally, the cabin is quiet — no wind noise, and just enough sound from the engine that you don’t feel isolated.\n\nFeatures\nAside from dressing up to drive them, I like how German luxury cars have a plethora of options and toys to play with. Our E350 was no exception, starting with the upgraded Harman Kardon stereo. I tested it with some classical music off my iPod, because classical music asks a stereo to deal with the widest variety of soft, gentle melodies and strong, booming notes. It performed well.\n\nI was also a fan of using Mercedes’ Comand system to control my iPod. I’d heard horror stories that these systems can be hard to use, but it was as easy as falling off a log.\n\nThe other thing I noticed immediately — and liked — was the optional panoramic sunroof that covers both rows of seats. It was very important for me — but then, I work in an area of my office building that’s so devoid of light I feel like I’m in a submarine. That’s parked inside a cave. At midnight.\n\nAnother nice touch was the standard ambient lighting in the cabin. It shines on cupholders, door panels and various other parts of the cabin. It’s soft enough that I don’t think it would bother people who prefer a perfectly dark cabin when they drive at night. I drove on a pitch-black night down country lanes and found the amount of light to be fine. It dresses up the cabin and shows off the premium materials with a soft, golden glow. A lot of cars these days have some form of ambient lighting — and many change color or have some other whiz-bang feature — but the subtle glow of this system is exactly what you’d expect in a refined luxury car.\n\nWe also had a blind spot assist that lit up a section of the side mirrors and set off an alarm if you tried to move into a lane when a car was already there. This helped on the driver’s side mirror, but I didn’t need it for the passenger side, probably because of how I had my mirrors set. But a word about those mirrors: They have a chopped, angular shape that looks great, but I don’t think they show as much of the road as they should. I’m not sure I’d feel confident driving the E-Class without some form of blind spot help. They also don’t fold completely in, leaving you more exposed to sideswipes when you’re parked in urban areas.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Mileage\nBecause the E-Class has been redesigned, we don’t yet have predicted reliability ratings for this model. Furthermore, the 2010 E-Class hasn’t yet been crash-tested by our preferred source, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. All-wheel-drive models are estimated to get 17/24 mpg city/highway — slightly less than models without all-wheel drive.\n\nStandard safety features for the E350 4Matic include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags that cover both rows of seats. As mentioned, our test model also came with a few optional safety features, including Blind-Spot Assist, Lane-Keeping Assist, Attention Assist, and an adaptive cruise control system called Distronic Plus with Pre-Safe Brake, which can apply the brakes to slow the car all the way to a stop if needed. Click here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nAbout the Distronic/Pre-Safe system: It works. In one of my highway drives, someone decided to exit the highway by cutting across three lanes of traffic in front of me and several other cars. I saw what was happening in time to have my foot on the brake pedal, and I’d like to say I was so quick I was able to properly apply the brakes — but the system was quicker. Let’s hope I never get to test the airbags.\n\nE350 In the Market\nAs I’ve said, the E350 is among the finest luxury cars I’ve driven. Loaded with all the options, it stickers for $51,100 so it better be. Still, I don’t mind paying for quality, and if something is among the very best, that’s what you have to pay.\n\nWhere I think things get interesting is deciding whether you spring for the E350 or the E550. If you go the E350 route, you’ll save some money and get a very nice car that’s acceptably quick. Or you could dig deeper into your wallet for the E550 and get all that comfort along with exceptional performance. Some may take a look at the Mercedes’ price, compare it to an American or Asian luxury car and say, “Whoa, now, why not go for a cheaper Lexus (or Lincoln, or Cadillac)?” To me, those cars are just fundamentally different from the Mercedes, BMWs and Audis of the world. Those non-German cars have fine qualities — all have excellent interiors, for instance — but to me, the German cars feel heavier (in a good way) and more secure, and I find the ride more to my liking. The E350 is no exception. If I had the money, it’s what I’d go for.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan is the workhorse of the Mercedes-Benz luxury showroom. It serves as a personal luxury car, executive transport, taxi cab or high-powered performance machine, depending on where in the world you happen to be. I recently drove a 10th-generation E-Class, an E300, which features a host of new safety systems, a new powertrain, new styling inside and out, and a new level of autonomous driving technology that’s sure to open some eyes.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n\nFrom the outside, the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class doesn’t really stand out. It’s certainly a handsome design, but it looks just like the S-Class, C-Class, CLA-Class and GLC-Class. All Mercedes-Benz products, especially the sedans, are starting to look the same, just in varying sizes — much like Audi. If you like the way one product looks, you’re probably going to like them all.\n\nThere are a few variations for the E-Class, such as the light pattern of the headlights and the continuation of a three-pointed-star hood ornament for the Luxury version or the laid-down badge for the Sport version. A sweeping character line extends from the front fenders to the rear ones, reminiscent of the original CLS sedan. The look is perhaps weakest from the rear three-quarters, where the rounded rump and generic taillights impart no presence or distinctiveness to the E-Class. It’s easy to lose it in a parking lot full of cars.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nMercedes-Benz has provided a driving experience to match the car’s luxurious accommodations. Fire up the E300’s turbocharged, 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine and you’ll be forgiven if you’re a little confused — it doesn’t sound like a four-cylinder at all. Listening to the pleasant burble of a powerful V-6 coming through the dashboard firewall –it only got better as I accelerated away — I wondered exactly what was going on. Turns out, Mercedes-Benz pipes engine sound into the cabin via the audio system (as do a growing number of automakers), otherwise you’d never hear the engine. The sound insulation in the E-Class is so good, it’s astonishingly silent at highway speeds. Mercedes-Benz insists it has merely piped in “enhanced” recorded engine sound, but I’m still not convinced it’s the sound from the 2.0-liter engine.\n\nThat engine is the same one you’ll find in the C-Class, making 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque. Its turbocharged, direct-injected nature allows all that torque to be produced much lower in the rev band than in the outgoing, standard V-6 engine, making the new E300 feel quick, powerful and substantial. It may be a big sedan with a turbo-four, but it gives up nothing in drivability with that smaller engine.\n\nThe nine-speed automatic transmission is fantastic, perfectly matched to the engine, and performs shifts so smoothly and quietly it’s difficult to determine when it happens. Put the car into Sport or Sport Plus mode, though, and it becomes more apparent, with more aggressive shift patterns and a computer that holds lower gears much longer than it would in the Eco or Comfort driving modes.\n\nThe standard suspension is adaptive and comes in two flavors: Luxury and Sport, with the Sport model being lowered slightly. You can also opt for an Airmatic air-spring suspension, which brings more adaptability and a ride that shows demonstrable differences between the most- and least-aggressive sport settings (unlike with the standard suspension).\n\nSteering feel is on the softer side, with its heavily boosted nature adding to the feeling of isolation that defines much of the rest of the E300 driving experience. But again, switching things into Sport or Sport Plus mode enables the E300 to dance through hills and canyons with aplomb. It proves to be a surprisingly good sport sedan, but with a base level of luxury and coddling that never quite goes away. It makes us really look forward to the upcoming E43 AMG and E63 AMG versions, with their hotter twin-turbo powertrains and more aggressive suspension tuning.\n\nCompared with its competition, the E300 is smoother, quieter and surprisingly quick for what’s under the hood. A turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is ubiquitous as a base engine in this class: the BMW 528i, Audi A6, Lexus GS and Cadillac CTS all have one. In terms of fuel economy, the E300 holds its own. It’s EPA-rated 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined for rear-wheel-drive versions and 22/29/24 mpg for 4Matic all-wheel-drive models. The rear-wheel-drive BMW 528i is rated 23/34/27 mpg — considerably better than the Benz despite being down one gear in its transmission. The Audi A6 does even better, at 24/35/28 mpg with front-wheel drive, while the Lexus GS 200t bests the E300, as well, with a rating of 22/33/26 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\n\nMercedes has crafted another knockout interior in the E300, with fresh designs, high-quality materials and cutting-edge technology. The seats feel as though they’ve been positioned lower than you find in most cars these days; my legs were stretched out in front of me unusually straight, with a low hip point. Width is a bit compromised due to the wide center console, but this driving position is fairly common among Mercedes’ sedans and coupes. The seats are supportive and comfortable, with Mercedes’ active multicontour and massaging functions available as options — but even at prices well north of $55,000, you still don’t get an actual leather seats.\n\nDespite a standard moonroof, headroom is plentiful up front and in back. What’s not plentiful in back is legroom, which is surprisingly scant: At 6 feet tall, I was unable to sit comfortably “behind myself” when I had adjusted the front seat to where I’d normally sit to drive. This is surprising for a vehicle of this size.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n\nThe most striking design elements of the new Mercedes E-class’ interior are its standard 12.3-inch central display and optional 12.3-inch gauge cluster screen. I drove two versions of the E300 — one without the fancy electronic gauges and one with the Premium 3 Package, which included the second digital screen.\n\nThe base car’s fixed gauges are attractive and flank a 7-inch screen that has all the traditional information Mercedes-Benz displays there, from trip info (such as fuel consumption) to entertainment and navigation info. The digital display is more striking, however, with three configurable themes: Classic, Sport and Progressive. Classic looks like the traditional gauges, while Sport gives them yellow numerals and hash marks. The gauges can be further customized to display various things, such as navigation directions instead of the tachometer. Progressive is the most unusual theme, and perhaps the least Benz-like; it’s more reminiscent of a hybrid or electric vehicle, providing the same information but in a less traditional format.\n\nThere’s a new Comand multimedia system for the Mercedes-Benz E-class, with a new menu system and three ways to control it: a new five-way controller on the right-side spoke of the steering wheel, a touchpad on the center console, and a selector knob just below the touchpad. It’s no easier to operate than the past Comand system, meaning it still requires some familiarization to make it work smoothly, but having a control on the steering wheel to operate the center display screen is handy. A matching five-way controller on the steering wheel’s opposite spoke controls the screen behind the steering wheel; both employ a new touch-sensitive button that looks like it’s straight off a Blackberry.\n\nAll the usual electronic customization options for the interior are present, including the fragrance dispenser first seen on the S-Class and a new 64-color selectable ambient lighting feature.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n\nExact trunk volume for the new E-Class was not available at publication time, but, as in the S-Class, a visual once-over makes it seem a bit smaller than the competition. Most of that competition hovers around the 14.0-cubic-foot mark, with the BMW 528i rating 14.0 cubic feet exactly. The Audi A6 measures at 14.1 cubic feet, the Cadillac CTS comes up a bit shorter at 13.7 cubic feet, and the Lexus GS 200t offers a surprisingly large 18.4 cubic feet of cargo room.\n\nStorage inside the Mercedes-Benz E-Class is decent, with a deep center console and large door storage pockets. The door pockets are particularly interesting: Mercedes uses unique technology to put larger woofers into the dashboard structure, enabling smaller speakers in the doors. That frees up some room, making for more door storage without compromising audio quality.\n\nSafety\n\n\nThe 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class has not yet been crash-tested, but when it is, the results will be posted here.\n\nMercedes-Benz continues to focus on safety in the 2017 E-Class, upping the ante this time with self-driving technology. All the other stuff you’d expect in a German luxury car is there, too, such as adaptive cruise control, plenty of airbags and Mercedes’ Pre-Safe predictive occupant-protection system, which tightens belts and applies the brakes more aggressively than the driver may be doing if it detects an impending collision.\n\nThere’s also a host of optional driver-assistance systems that add to the experience, some of which start to incorporate autonomous driving technology. The E300’s adaptive cruise control now can be had with something called Drive Pilot, which not only maintains distance from the car in front of you but can also follow that car through curves. Steering Pilot includes an active lane change assist: Once you’ve set the cruise control, you can use the turn signals to make the car change lanes without your intervention, so long as the car doesn’t detect a vehicle in the adjacent lane (or one approaching at a high rate of speed, using its long-range rear-facing radar).\n\nA new side radar system is also available. It can detect an impending side impact and take a couple of extra steps to protect occupants: It will rapidly inflate a bladder in the front seat sides that will push you a few inches away from the side of the impact to reduce the shock on your body. It also plays a sound through the audio system to prime muscles in your middle ear, minimizing the shock to your sensitive auditory organs from the loud blasts of airbags and the impact itself.\n\nI experienced this “pink noise” myself during my drive when a tour bus came around a bend and the car decided an impact was likely; it was just a short burst of static over the audio system, but it was fascinating to experience one of these automatic safety systems in action.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. Evasive Steering Assist helps you steer around obstacles at low, urban speeds, such as a pedestrian who might have walked out in front of you. Emergency Stop Assist will activate your hazard lights and bring your car to a safe halt if it detects you haven’t touched the steering wheel in a while, assuming you’ve had a medical emergency. Active Brake Assist will brake the car if it detects an impending collision and you don’t react, while the Speed Limit Pilot automatically adjusts your speed to the local speed limit when it changes along the highway. It can be overridden manually.\n\nIt has to be said: It doesn’t all work perfectly. During a three-hour highway drive from Carmel Valley, Calif., to San Francisco International Airport, I sampled all these technologies in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Drive Pilot works well under most conditions and even lets you take your hands off the wheel while it steers for you for up to 60 seconds. But it sometimes loses its place, such as cresting a rise where the highway also bends. At lower speeds it failed three times to detect a vehicle that was merging into my lane, causing me to hit the brakes to avoid a low-speed collision. And the automatic speed limit adjustment on the cruise control dropped me from 70 to 40 mph when I entered a zone that had trucks exiting the highway for a weigh station check — where the truck speed limit was 40 mph.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nDeliveries of the new E300 will begin soon. The standard rear-wheel-drive model starts at $53,075 including destination. The all-wheel-drive 4Matic version starts at $55,575. My test car had the Premium 3 Package, which included bits like Burmester premium audio, automatic parking assist, air suspension, all the mentioned safety systems and more. The estimated price as-tested for my vehicle came to more than $69,000 and could be pushed even higher.\n\nCompetitors are almost universally less expensive. The BMW 528i starts at $51,195 and features just about everything the standard E300 does. The Audi A6 and Cadillac CTS start for considerably less — $47,125 for the Audi, $46,555 for the Cadillac — but the Audi gives you a standard leather interior, even on the base model. The Lexus GS 200t is another option for shoppers, starting at $46,565. All these cars offer similar power. Cadillac wins the horsepower war with 268 hp and the lightest curb weight, but of all these models, the E300 remains a top pick.\n\nLike the rest of the Mercedes-Benz lineup, the E300 tends to be pricier than its competition. But like the rest of the Mercedes-Benz lineup, in exchange for your cash, you’ll get a car that feels as expensive as it is.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class includes a midsize sedan and wagon, offered with a choice of engines and all-wheel or rear-wheel drive. Apart from the V6 and two V-8 gasoline engines, a diesel version is also available: the E320 Bluetec. That’s the 2008 model I tested. I’ll address the E-Class sedan overall, along with the performance and implications of its diesel engine in these days of high gas prices, even higher diesel prices and technology that blasts any misconceptions you might hold about its power, noise, smell and pollution levels. See the feature differences among Mercedes-Benz E-Class trim levels in this side-by-side comparison.\n\n \n\nDiesel vs. Gas\nWhy should you even consider a diesel? Diesel engines, which historically have been dirty (in terms of tailpipe emissions), are also inherently more efficient than comparable gasoline engines, so they burn less fuel to achieve the same ends. Theoretically, this saves you money. Also, the amount of fuel burned is proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide released, so any time you’re burning less fuel you’re contributing less greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. All we ever needed to do was fix the other environmental problem, the pollutants — mainly soot and oxides of nitrogen. Thanks to ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, which is relatively new in the States, and technology such as common-rail injection, we can now use exhaust aftertreatment that has been employed in Europe for years. As a result, the E320 Bluetec is the cleanest diesel car sold in the U.S. That’s been the case since 2007, when it replaced the 2006 E320 CDI (practically the same car but not quite as clean). Volkswagen pulled its diesels from the market to clean them up in time for 2009.\n\nTechnically, the Bluetec isn’t sold in California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont — all of which follow California’s stricter pollution limits. In California, though, Mercedes-Benz worked out a deal to offer a limited number of E320 Bluetecs through a two-year/24,000-mile lease. (Later this year, when Bluetec technology with urea injection hits the company’s SUVs, they will be sold in all 50 states. The E-Class won’t be 50-state compliant until it’s redesigned for 2009 or ’10.)\n\nAs is usually the case with luxury cars, even the base engine — a 3.5-liter gasoline V6 — is plenty powerful, capable of 0-60 times of just 6.5 seconds, according to Mercedes-Benz. As the table illustrates, the diesel has less horsepower than the V6 gas engine but more torque than the V-8 gas engine. Torque is important, and nowhere is that clearer than in the Bluetec’s 0-60 time, which is a mere tenth of a second slower than the E350 gas version.\n\nMercedes-Benz E-Class\n \tE320 Bluetec\tE350\tE550\tE63 AMG\nBase list price\t$52,200\t$51,200\t$59,700\t$85,300\nEngine size\t3.0-liter\t3.5-liter\t5.5-liter\t6.3-liter\nEngine type\tturbo-diesel V-6\tV-6\tV-8\tV-8\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t210 @ 3,800\t268 @ 6,000\t382 @ 6,000\t507 @ 6,800\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t400 @\n1,600-\n2,400\t258 @ 2,400-\n5,000\t391 @ 2,800-\n4,800\t465 @ 5,200\nEPA-estimated MPG (city/highway — combined)\t23/32 — 26\t17/24 — 19\t15/22 — 17\t12/19 — 15\nRequired fuel\tultra-low-\nsulfur diesel\tregular gasoline*\tregular gasoline*\tregular gasoline*\nManufacturer-\nestimated 0-60 mph (sec.)\t6.6\t6.5\t5.4\t4.3\n*Premium gasoline recommended for performance specs shown.\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\n \n\nBy the numbers, one of the advantages is clear: combined fuel economy of 26 mpg compared to the most efficient gas engine’s mileage of 19 mpg. But then there’s the issue of fuel cost. You may have noticed that the pendulum of diesel fuel — which historically has cost less than gasoline — has swung the other way. Mathematics are in order: The week preceding this report saw ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel prices averaging $4.71 per gallon in the U.S. Premium gasoline cost $4.20 on average. That’s 12 percent more for diesel. The E320 Bluetec’s mileage is 37 percent higher than the gas-powered E350, so there’s a definite advantage on a tank-by-tank basis, at least for this model. (Even if you ran the E350 on regular rather than premium gas at last week’s $3.98 average price, the diesel would be 18 percent more expensive — low enough to be offset by the Bluetec’s higher mileage.) And your own actual mileage may vary from these city mpg and hwy mpg figures.\n\nSimilar to hybrids, diesel drivetrains tend to cost more than comparable gas-only versions. It’s true here, too, but the E320 Bluetec’s price premium is exactly $1,000. Not bad. Unfortunately, there are other shortcomings to diesel, not the least of which is a scarcity of filling stations. In most areas of the country you can find diesel fuel … but you have to look. The upside is that you’ll do so less frequently thanks to the Bluetec’s higher efficiency; theoretically, you can go 485 miles of all-city driving or 675 miles on the highway between fill-ups. The biggest problem I see with investing in a diesel is the unknown. As Americans are finally figuring out, there’s no promise that gas will ever become cheap … or stay cheap for long … or do anything but continue to climb in price. Likewise, there’s no telling what will happen to diesel fuel prices. They could come down closer to gas, or they could skyrocket beyond comprehension. We just don’t know, and it’s out of the buyer’s control.\n\nBeyond the general downsides of buying a diesel, I found a critical downside to the E320 Bluetec: accelerator lag. To be clear, the car really moves out … once it starts moving, but oftentimes it takes too long to do so after you tromp on the accelerator. From a standing start or when in motion, the engine regularly waits a beat or two to respond. This could be turbo lag, electronic throttle lag, transmission lag or some other kind of lag not yet discovered by man, but it’s lag and I consider it a serious problem, as I do in gasoline-powered vehicles that exhibit the same behavior. I’ve experienced degrees of the same in other Mercedes-Benz models, such as the ML320 CDI sport utility that uses this engine, but it’s not a characteristic of diesels overall.\n\n \n\nGoing & Stopping\nAccelerator lag notwithstanding, the E320 Bluetec’s drivetrain gives up nothing to the gas type; in fact its high torque at low engine speeds makes for confident, drama-free acceleration. The engine’s sound is different, but not by any means noisier than the gas V6; in fact, the latter has to rev higher and work a little bit harder to get a move on, so in some instances you’re more likely to hear that one than the diesel. Overall, though, the cabin is very quiet.\n\nThe seven-speed automatic transmission is so smooth it fades into the background. Shared with the gas models, this transmission has a button on the center console marked C/S that selects between two drive modes, Comfort and Sport. Comfort is a word that makes sense when applied to adjustable suspension firmness, but I don’t think there’s anything uncomfortable about the Sport transmission mode. What Sport does is hold onto lower gears until higher up the engine’s rpm range, which keeps power at the ready. It also makes the transmission kick down more readily when you jab the accelerator. The tradeoff to this mode is lower fuel economy. C mode is more conservative with the shifts, and might better be called E for Economy or Efficiency.\n\nBy knocking the gear selector left or right you can downshift or upshift, respectively, but this isn’t a true sequential-shifting, or clutchless manual, feature like some cars offer because it doesn’t hold a gear. It simply locks out the gears above the one selected, and the trans shifts freely among the lower gears. It’s no different than the “4321” settings that still follow the D in some cars’ PRND4321 shift range. Mercedes doesn’t offer a manual gearbox for the E-Class.\n\nI had to adjust to my test car’s pushbutton ignition, which allows you to leave the keyfob in your pocket. The concept isn’t a new one, but this car’s start/stop button tops the gearshift knob, and the previous car I tested had a button in the same place that had to be pushed before moving the lever. Time after time, I went to move the transmission out of Park, pushed the button and killed the engine. After a few days I got past it, but if you own two cars — one of each type — you might want to bank some spare funds to replace your starter motor twice as often.\n\nCompared to the V-6, the gas V-8 propels the car even more effortlessly, but you’d have to be a serious leadfoot to sign on for the E550’s 17 combined mpg when the fuel-cost game has changed as much as it has.\n\nRelieved of the numb Sensotronic electro-hydraulic brakes that accompanied this Mercedes-Benz E-Class generation’s debut, it now has effective, agreeable antilock four-wheel disc brakes that do the job as expected. (The “by-wire” braking system was discontinued from the E-Class and CLS-Class because of reliability problems, but the overarching problem was that they felt like you were trying to brake with your foot wrapped in a sponge. Sensotronic now plagues only the SL-Class and SLR McLaren supercar.)\n\nNo Sport Sedan\nThere may be a Sport mode on the transmission, but if you’re looking for a luxury sport sedan, the E-Class isn’t it. The luxury is there, and it’s hard to argue with the AMG version’s sporting capabilities, but overall the E’s handling and braking don’t compare to those of the BMW 5 Series or Jaguar XF — or even the Acura TL, Audi A6 or Cadillac STS. Across the board, when I think of “drivers’ cars,” the Mercedes brand doesn’t come to mind. I’m not quick to generalize, but I’m comfortable with this one.\n\nThe car shares a formula with the best-regarded competitors: rear-wheel drive and plenty of power. The weight distribution doesn’t feel as balanced, though, and body motion isn’t as well controlled as in the BMW 5 Series. The steering is numb and in no hurry to snap back to center after a turn. Overall, the car can do much of what many sport sedans and wagons can do, but it doesn’t have the right feel. The Euro-firm ride is decent but not the most comfortable you’ll find, even among cars with better handling. To get a softer ride, you’ll have to opt for the adaptive suspension, which has three firmness settings, the lowest of which is softer than the standard suspension.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class’ seats are comfortable in the best way — supportive rather than overly cushy, for the long haul — and the pictographic power controls are on the doors where every manufacturer should put them. Note that the standard upholstery is leatherette (aka vinyl) — a bummer in a luxury car. Some competitors have standard leather. The interior dimensions are competitive within the midsize luxury class, though at the lower end, with legroom that’s an inch shy of the Jaguar XF’s and a few tenths short of the BMW 5 Series and Lexus GS. All are rear-drive cars, which share the space-robbing high center floor hump that makes their center seat less usable. (For what it’s worth, the popularity of all-wheel drive increasingly gives modern front-drive platforms, like the Audi A6’s, the same problem.)\n\n\nIn some respects the interior is better than some competitors’, in that the materials and craftsmanship are mostly high-quality, and the design is less stark than in the BMW, but there are some anomalies. The ventilation knobs have a loose and cheap feel and sound, and the pop-up plastic lock knobs are possibly the crappiest part I’ve ever seen in a Mercedes. Last redesigned for 2003, the E-Class is due for an update, and it shows inside. The S-Class’ interior is splendid, and even the entry-level C-Class improves on aspects of the E. It was redesigned for 2008, so the next E should also leap forward.\n\nAmong the cabin’s pluses were my test car’s optional panoramic moonroof — essentially separate panes over the front and rear seats. The main annoyance was the center armrest, if you can call it that. It’s a cupholder/storage area with a sliding lid that’s not even comfortable when closed. It’s not the best location for cupholders, and the storage bin is small. You can remove the cupholder module for more space, but then … no cupholders. Storage options were otherwise decent, with a reasonably sized glove compartment and door pockets front and rear, cubbies on the fronts of the front seat cushions and seatback pockets for the backseat.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the E-Class scored Good (the highest rating) in a frontal impact and Acceptable in the side-impact test. Acceptable is acceptable, but many cars — especially luxury models — now boast Good ratings for side impact. (The BMW 5 Series hasn’t been tested with optional side-impact airbags; without the feature, it scored Marginal.) Side-impact torso airbags are standard on the E-Class for the outboard rear as well as the front seats. Other airbags include side curtain bags for head protection along the side windows (front and rear) and of course the required front bags. The front seats have active head restraints.\n\nAlong with the antilock brakes with brake assist comes a standard electronic stability system with traction control. Also included is Tele Aid, Mercedes-Benz’s version of GM’s OnStar, and the Pre-Safe system. Pre-Safe senses emergency situations, when brake assist activates or oversteer or understeer occur, and it prepares the car for a collision by cinching the electric seat belt pretensioners and adjusting the front passenger seat to position the occupant optimally for impact.\n\nCargo\nWith its 15.9-cubic-foot trunk, the E-Class is midrange for cargo volume. The Jaguar XF has 17.7 cu. ft. and the Lexus GS has 12.7 cu. ft. A 60/40-split folding backseat adds versatility, but it’s a $350 option. Why do we pay more in luxury cars for features that are standard on econoboxes? At least the Audi A6 and Jaguar XF include a folding backseat as standard equipment.\n\nAs shown in the photos, the seat cushions must be flipped forward before the backrests can fold flat. The best thing you can say about this old-school approach is that it results in a flat cargo floor. Unfortunately, you have to flip the cushion from the back door, but the backrest release is in the trunk. It would be better if the backrest release were in the cabin — or if you didn’t have to flip the cushion at all. A power trunk closer is a stand-alone option.\n\nE-Class in the Market\nThe E-Class is definitely showing its age. The strength of the brand and relatively high resale values allow Mercedes-Benz to charge more than most of its competitors, and to nickel-and-dime buyers on some basic options like the folding backseat, leather, bi-xenon headlights, parking sonar and heated seats. At this size and price, the E-Class has a lot of competition apart from the European models I concentrated on, including the Acura TL and RL and the Cadillac CTS and STS. A choice of engines, transmissions and drivelines are becoming the norm, so this old dog will need to learn some new tricks soon if it wants to keep up with the luxury-on-wheels pack.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon will go down in history as one of my family’s favorite test cars ever. Sure, it drives incredibly well, has all the ooh-la-la extras you’d want in a $70,000 Benz, but even more importantly, it sports one of the best automotive inventions for families of all times: the rear-facing jump seat. Oh, did I mention it has all-wheel drive?\n\nThe E350 wagon is a full-sized station wagon like the ones many of us grew up riding in during the ’70s, but it’s been whisked into the 21st century with its modern styling and amenities.\n\nDriving the E350 wagon was a pleasure with its 3.5-liter V-6 engine and standard all-wheel drive. It’s no tiny urban eco-car, but it drives much smaller than it looks. Tight parking spaces were a cinch with its small 36.9-foot turning radius. The ride was smooth enough to cancel out rough roads. It was comfortable enough for daily driving or longer road trips while maintaining a responsive feel that wasn’t too floaty.\n\nThe E-Class is also available as a sedan, coupe and Cabriolet. The E50 wagon has a starting MSRP of $56,200. My test car cost $70,485.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe E350 wagon seems to alternate between looking like a retro station wagon from my youth and a pimped-out swagger wagon. Sorry, Toyota, but the term swagger wagon fits this German Benz much better than your Japanese minivan.\n\nFrom the side, the old-school wagon inspiration is apparent with the E350 wagon’s grandiose cargo area that looks like the large posterior segment of an ant’s exoskeleton. There you have it, people — I am in fact using my zoology degree.\n\nThen your eye carries you to the sporty rear spoiler and roof-mounted antenna, and you see more “rapper chic” than creepy insect. The 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine is paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission, and it gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway that will carry you to the recording studio, the carpool lane or the ant farm.\n\nThis is a low-to-the-ground wagon, so people of all sizes will be able to climb in and out of it easily due to its low ground clearance and reachable door handles.\n\nA power liftgate is standard, and as expected, the cargo area is expansive. When the rear-facing jump seat is folded flat into the cargo floor, the wagon is ready for anything you can throw at it. With the jump seat up, there’s obviously less overall cargo space, but there’s some extra space for a couple of grocery bags under the load floor where a kid’s feet would normally rest when buckled into the jump seat.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe E350 wagon’s interior is where this Benz makes its case to be your new family car.\n\nThe rear-facing jump seat was the most fun my kids have had in a car in forever. They loved that we had space to pick up a friend for a last-minute sleepover when typically the “we don’t have enough space in our car” excuse precludes such fun endeavors. All three of my kids plus our weekend plus-one spent a fair amount of time arguing over who would sit in the back. Finally, they worked out a rotation system to keep it fair.\n\nThe jump seat fits two small-sized children in seat belts; most teenagers won’t have enough headroom to fit back there. My kids often complained of overheating in the way back, though. There are no air vents in the jump seat area and all the windows made for a hot ride during the scorching summer months.\n\nNot all the fun is reserved for the lucky two that get to sit in the way back. The second row in my test car featured an optional rear entertainment system ($1,910), with two screens mounted on the back of the front head restraints and wireless headphones. While this feature may work for some families, my family now skips these systems in favor of our iPad on road trips. The kids can easily operate the iPad and toggle between movies, books and games.\n\nThe second row also has enough legroom to accommodate both kids’ legs and their backpacks. That’s no small feat in today’s world. There’s also a fold-down armrest in the second row with two cupholders plus a storage cubby. Two huge sunshade-covered panoramic sunroofs in the E-Class kept the cabin light and airy, while manually operated sunshades on the second-row windows kept the direct sun off my little ones.\n\nIn the front row, my test car had the optional Drive-Dynamic Multicontour driver’s seat with massage ($660). This is worth every penny just for the massage feature. With two drivers of drastically different sizes (I’m 5 feet 3 inches tall and my husband is 6 feet 2 inches), the 14-way power-adjustable driver’s seat allowed both of us to get a customized fit. This seat’s active bolsters also hold the driver in place when cornering.\n\nThe optional heated and active ventilated front seats ($450) were a disappointment when it came to the ventilated part. The seats took a long time to cool down. Even then, the pleasant breeze normally associated with ventilated seats was so gentle it was almost unnoticeable.\n\nThe center stack features Mercedes-Benz’s Comand multimedia system with its huge 7-inch screen. Someone buying this seven-seater will eventually figure out how to navigate through the screens and menus, but for the one week I was in the E-Class, I found this system to be more complicated than I’d like. For me, the pure definition of luxury is cleanliness and simplicity, and the E-Class’ Comand system could definitely use some simplifying.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe Mercedes-Benz E350 wagon has some of the best Latch anchors tested to date. The two sets of lower anchors are housed behind flexible rubber gaskets in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. To access the lower Latch anchors, you simply push in the rubber gasket. Voila: a Latch anchor for installing a rear-facing infant-safety seat, convertible seat or Latch-connected booster seat.\n\nFor bigger kids in booster seats, both parents and kids alike will appreciate that the wagon’s seat belt buckles. They’re on stable bases, making it easy for kids to buckle up independently. There’s also enough seat width in the second row that wider boosters fit without riding over the buckle. Find out how the E350 wagon performed in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhile I loved the rear-facing jump seat in the E350 wagon, I don’t love that its side curtain airbags only extend to the second row rather than all the way back to the jump seat. The E350 wagon has nine airbags standard, including a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nThe E350 has a standard backup camera, though it takes a couple of seconds for it to engage after the car is put in Reverse. I often started to back up without the camera working, rendering it useless.\n\nThe E350 wagon also has standard all-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control, active front head restraints and Attention Assist, which monitors the driver’s drowsiness.\n\nOptional safety features include side-impact airbags for the second row, blind spot and lane departure warning systems, collision detection with automatic braking and night vision with pedestrian detection.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 wagon here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Mercedes-Benz E350 wagon has spoiled me for the rest of my days. With a ton of cargo space and the capability to transport my family in vogue as well as in comfort, this wagon also delivers a sublime driving experience.\n\nSimply put, the 2012 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon is the ultimate family mobile, with exception of one giant not-so-family-friendly feature: its price.\n\nThis wagon has quite a hefty price tag; it starts at $58,025, including an $875 destination charge. But if your family is in the market for a car at this price point, the E350 wagon won’t disappoint — especially if performance is near the top of the priority list.\n\nIt’s expected that a Mercedes-Benz will offer many luxuries and amenities, but what I wasn’t expecting was the E-Class wagon’s exceptional handling. I suppose it didn’t hurt that my upgraded test car’s driver’s seat massaged me as I drove. It did take me a short time to get used to the wagon’s extended length, but once I did, I found it easy to maneuver. Whether on freeways or suburban streets, the ride feels smooth without being sleep-inducing. Acceleration with the 3.5-liter V-6 is graceful but packs a punch when needed, and braking is precise. The E350 comes standard with all-wheel drive.\n\nAll the engineering in the 2012 E350 wagon comes at a price. To get one as well-equipped as the wagon I tested with real-time traffic and navigation, dual rear entertainment screens and that amazing massaging driver’s seat costs $76,055.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe seven-seat E350 is a big wagon, but it couldn’t be any further from the bloated wood-paneled ones often associated with this particular body style. Its exterior looks almost regal with its exaggerated length, but there are hints of sportiness in its sleek profile and chiseled build. Mercedes-Benz succeeded in bucking the negative wagon stereotypes when it comes to the E350, and quite frankly — a wagon has never looked so good.\n\nWhat’s great about a wagon is it’s still a car; it’s easy for everybody to pile into and simple to load and unload. Door handles can be reached by most, and the usual higher step-up that comes with SUVs matching the E350’s seating capacity isn’t an issue.\n\nA power liftgate is standard, which is always a perk for busy parents, but an even better feature is that the keyless entry works on both the front and rear doors. It might sound trivial, but as I’m always carrying bags in addition to my child (and trying to hurry to get my daughter loaded in the car while someone is impatiently waiting for my parking space), being able to walk up to the rear door and open it with no extra steps was huge for me. The loss of that particular feature is one I’ve cursed ever since the day my test drive of the E-Class wagon ended.\n\nAt 20.5 cubic feet, the wagon’s cargo area rivals the space found in some three-row SUVs, and if the second row is folded down, the E50’s cargo space appears cavernous. There’s almost nothing you won’t be able to bring with you on a trip in the E350 wagon.\n\nNot so trivial is the seven-speed automatic transmission that’s paired with the 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, making this wagon much more than just a grocery-getter. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/27 mpg city/highway, which I found surprising due to its size and standard all-wheel drive. I averaged just slightly below its 22 mpg combined city/highway rating during my weeklong test drive. This wagon requires premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nAlmost everything inside of the E350 wagon made me swoon. From the buttery rich optional leather interior, to the perfectly contoured driver’s seat, to the available panoramic sunroof, the interior is upscale and gorgeous. The wood accents seem a little dated to me, but I’ll chalk it up to personal preference.\n\nFamilies will immediately notice that the E-Class wagon’s interior is spacious. It was the perfect car for our family to take on a day trip up to the mountains. When Grandma and Grandpa joined us one evening, all five of us fit easily in the first and second rows. There is plenty of legroom, and you shouldn’t hear any complaints with regard to personal space, even if rear-facing child safety seats are installed.\n\nThe E350 wagon also offers a unique option for accommodating more passengers: two rear-facing seats are located in the cargo area. These jump seats bring seating capacity in the E350 wagon up to seven. The seats even come with their own cupholders! Although my husband fit and sat in the back for the sheer novelty of it, the seats are better suited for children, but only those who are out of child-safety seats. Teens will likely find they’re too big to sit back there.\n\nAnother perk kids will love are the dual entertainment screens on the backs of both front seats ($1,910). There won’t be any arguments over storage; each passenger gets their own cupholder, and there’s plenty of additional space in the seatback pockets and door pockets. Parents will enjoy an additional storage bin under the front armrest, bottleholders in the door pockets and bins underneath the front seats.\n\nIf you really want to bring on the luxury, there are many ways that Mercedes-Benz can indulge you. Of course, adding features means adding to the price, but if you’ve got the extra cash, these luxuries have the ability to elevate your usual commute to a zen-like experience. Listening to the Spa channel on satellite radio while using the massaging driver’s seat will make you want to circle the block a few times before picking the kids up from school. And the way the active seat bolsters “hug” and support you with each turn will keep you relaxed on the most hectic of days. It’s no exaggeration when I say that I could’ve driven the E350 wagon all day long.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nMercedes-Benz makes things as easy as possible when it comes to Latch anchor access. The E350 wagon features my favorite setup: plastic covers that flip up to reveal the Latch anchor. I love that I don’t have to dig between the cushions to find anchors. The wagon has two sets of Latch anchors in the outboard seats, and car-seat installation is a snap. Two child-safety seats, including rear-facing seats, fit easily in the second row, but three car seats won’t fit across the backseat.\n\nThe E350 wagon has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera, rear parking sensors, active front head restraints and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag. However, the side curtain airbags only provide protection for the first- and second-row seats. They don’t extend into the third row.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s Pre-Safe system, which is standard, can anticipate a collision and automatically tighten seat belts, close windows and the sunroof, and adjust the front seat to better protect the driver in a crash. Also standard is Attention Assist, which monitors the driver’s behavior to detect signs of drowsiness.\n\nOptional features are night vision, blind spot and lane departure warning systems, and adaptive, auto-leveling headlights. The feature I tested most, especially in Los Angeles’ stop-and-go traffic, was the Distronic Plus technology. It’s also known as adaptive cruise control, which maintains a set distance from the car in front of you and brakes as needed for traffic. It was incredibly accurate and impressive.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMercedes’ E-Class is offered in four body styles and a choice of engines, including diesel and hybrid drivetrains. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, as is a high-performance E63 AMG edition. Depending on the body style, the E-Class seats four to seven people. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Infiniti M.\n\n(Skip to details on the: E63 AMG, E-Class Cabriolet, E400 Hybrid)\nNew for 2013\nThe biggest news for 2013 is the introduction of a hybrid version of the E-Class. Powered by a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and a 27-hp electric motor, the E400 Hybrid is expected to get an estimated 24/31 mpg city/highway.\n\nMeanwhile, all E-Class coupes and convertibles gain heated front seats, electromechanical power steering, mbrace2 telematics and wheel upgrades. The sedan and wagon also come with mbrace2 standard.\nExterior\nThe E-Class’ headlights have slot-like inboard bezels, while the outboard portions resemble those on the C-Class. Eyebrow-like fog lights sit in the three-piece lower air dam. In comparison, the taillights are much more reserved. The E350 has oval exhaust pipes, and the E550’s are trapezoidal. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels\nStandard LED daytime running lights\nOptional adaptive xenon headlights\nRear air suspension on wagon\nStandard power tilt/sliding sunroof\n\nInterior\nAll E-Class models feature Mercedes’ knob-based Comand interface that includes primary controls at hip level, ahead of the center armrest, like the systems in the C-Class and flagship S-Class. The E-Class has Mercedes’ new mbrace2 communication system that includes the ability to connect the car with a smartphone. Interior features include:\n\n\nWagon has seven-seat capacity with standard rear-facing third row and power tailgate\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional leather upholstery\nOptional massaging, bolster-adjustable seats\nOptional tri-zone automatic climate control\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe available adaptive suspension alters shock-absorber settings to react to changing road conditions. The available Airmatic air suspension includes driver-adjustable Comfort and Sport settings. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n210-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel V-6 (E350 Bluetec)\n302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (E350)\n302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with 27-hp electric motor (E400 Hybrid)\n402-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 (E550)\n518-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 (E63 AMG, 550 hp with optional Performance Package)\nSeven-speed automatic transmission for all models\n\nSafety\nBesides antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system, the E-Class has nine standard airbags. Mercedes’ Pre-Safe system is also standard; it cinches seat belts, repositions seats and attempts to close the windows and moonroof if it senses an imminent accident. Additional safety features include:\n\n\nStandard Attention Assist system measures steering behavior and other parameters to sense driver fatigue\nOptional automatic high-beam headlights\nOptional blind spot and lane departure warning systems\nOptional night vision system\n\nE63 AMG\nThe automaker’s high-performance division, AMG, has produced its own variant of the midsize luxury sedan. Available as either a sedan or wagon, the E63 AMG features a high-powered V-8 engine, chassis modifications and revised styling inside and out.\n\nThe E63 AMG is powered by a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 engine that produces 518 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. With an optional Performance Package, the engine pumps out 550 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque. The V-8 teams with a seven-speed automatic transmission. Fuel-saving stop/start technology is standard on the E63 AMG.\n\nThe car features an adaptive suspension called AMG Ride Control. The suspension uses front steel springs and rear air springs, and the dampers are varied automatically based on the driving situation. The suspension also includes three modes — Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus — to suit the driver’s preference. Additional features include a quicker steering ratio and an AMG brake kit.\n\nExterior styling cues include wider front fenders, more aggressive front and rear aprons, larger rocker panels, tinted headlights, unique chrome tailpipes and 19-inch alloy wheels. Wagon versions gain a panoramic moonroof. Cabin enhancements include AMG sport seats, a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, an AMG-specific instrument panel and stainless steel pedals. Attention Assist, a system designed to tell when the driver is tired, is standard. Back to top\nE-Class Cabriolet\nAvailable in E350 and E550 versions, the four-seat Cabriolet is a soft-top convertible that replaced the CLK-Class convertible. It’s based on the E-Class coupe, with nearly identical dimensions inside and out. The top opens or closes within 20 seconds when driving 25 mph or slower. In lieu of the coupe’s curtain airbags, the Cabriolet uses “headbags” that deploy upward from the doors.\n\nNotable options include Airscarf, a feature that blows warm air at the back of front-seat occupants’ necks from just under the head restraints. Airscarf uses electric heat, so it warms up faster than the car itself. The Aircap option raises a spoiler from the top of the windshield frame; at the same time, the rear head restraints rise, deploying a windscreen. The two provisions direct the onrush of air higher over the cabin, reducing turbulence. Back to top\nE400 Hybrid\nThe new E400 Hybrid features compact hybrid components attached to Mercedes’ familiar 3.5-liter V-6 engine.\n\nThe gas-electric hybrid system — which includes auto stop/start, regenerative braking and pure electric driving, depending on speed — offers an estimated 24/31 mpg, according to Mercedes. The system, which was originally featured on the S-Class, improves gas mileage by about 17 percent over the regular E350. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Cabriolet is a refined Sunday driver that’s priced competitively against more purpose-built roadsters, and it’s well-executed to boot.\n\nThe E-Class Cabriolet comes in V-6 E350 and V-8 E550 variants, both with rear-wheel drive. Compare them here, or click here to compare the Cabriolet with the rest of the E-Class lineup. For a broader review of the E-Class, click here to read our take on the sedan. The following review focuses on the convertible, which we tested in E550 form.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMercedes updated the E-Class for 2014 (compare it with the 2013 here) with a sinewy expression that harkens to the brand’s redesigned S-Class flagship. Most noticeably, the nose retires the quad headlights that have characterized the E-Class since 1996; the new lights sit within singular frames. Mercedes says that vertical LED pipes preserve the beloved “four-eye” look, but that’s little consolation to fans of the old styling. (It is consolation, however, to anyone who endured grade-school mockery for wearing glasses.)\n\nThe car’s upright profile and carryover tail will remind onlookers that this remains the current generation E-Class, which hit dealerships clear back in summer 2009. As before, the E-Class coupe and convertible are still 7.1 inches shorter than the sedan but also (more significantly) 2.7 inches narrower.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the E-Class Cabriolet, with 19s optional. The convertible’s power soft-top can raise and lower at speeds up to 25 miles per hour; including the windows, it took 22 seconds to lower and 28 seconds to raise.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe headlong rush among European automakers toward relatively small, turbocharged V-8s has produced tantalizing results. Step on the gas, and the E550’s 402-horsepower, turbocharged 4.7-liter V-8 piles on effortless speed with only modest accelerator lag. It’s a welcome sensation, given Mercedes’ penchant for glacial accelerator progression. Punch the pedal, and the exhaust turns to a muted whine as the E550 Cabriolet moves with no discernable turbo lag and surprising quickness for its 4,048-pound curb weight — 429 pounds more than an E350 coupe. Credit the responsive seven-speed automatic transmission, which kicks down several gears with little delay to send the drivetrain’s 443 pounds-feet of torque (available at just 1,600 rpm) to the rear wheels. It’s more power than anyone needs, but it comes with a half-decent EPA-estimated 17/26/20 mpg city/highway/combined. Not bad for a V-8.\n\nAll the E550’s curb weight plays against handling, however. Adjusted to its Sport mode — part of a two-mode setup that comes on the fancier of two adaptive suspensions in the E-Class — the E550’s suspension keeps body roll reasonably in check, but the Cabriolet’s nose plows through corners with buckets of understeer for a rear-drive car. When you finally work the tail out, it comes free in a skittish, erratic manner. No match for aggressive cornering, the E550 is a straight-line cruiser.\n\nThe E350 Cabriolet might suit corners better, as it sheds 165 pounds versus the E550 — much of that over the front axle, thanks to its smaller engine (a 3.5-liter V-6 with 302 hp that’s EPA-rated at 22 mpg combined). Mercedes says the E350 Cabriolet hits 60 mph in 6.3 seconds. That’s plenty quick, albeit short of the E550’s 4.9 seconds.\n\nTop-up cruising is quiet enough that you might forget this is a soft-top, not a hardtop, convertible. Ride quality is decent, but we’ve come to expect more from Mercedes’ adaptive suspensions. The Comfort and Sport modes lack a clear difference, and Comfort masks most imperfections but lacks the buttery-smooth damping of earlier adaptive-suspension E-Class sedans we’ve tested.\n\nInterior\nSee our review of the E-Class sedan for detailed impressions of the interior. Suffice it to say the convertible, like the rest of the lineup, has minor revisions for 2014. The dashboard retains a conservative design and consistent materials, if little eye candy in most versions. (The high-performance E63 AMG sedan and Mercedes’ Designo versions raise the visual ante with stitched dashboard trim, which most E-Classes forgo.)\n\nThe E-Class Cabrio’s two-person backseat, which has 2.5 inches less legroom than the coupe, still has decent space for adults. Access is easy thanks to front seats that automatically power out of the way when you tilt the backrest forward, then power back to their earlier position once you’re in. Padded surroundings, climate vents and a center armrest give backseat passengers premium confines, but anyone with longer legs won’t like the hard plastic of the front seatbacks.\n\nWhen compared with the sedan, besides the expected backseat reductions, the coupe’s shape sacrifices about an inch of front-seat headroom and 3.7 inches’ shoulder room, but the Cabriolet — which of course lacks the coupe’s standard headroom-reducing moonroof — gains the noggin space back when the top is up.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThanks to an intuitive, multilevel menu setup, Mercedes’ standard Comand is still among our favorite knob-based multimedia systems, though the dashboard screen is a bit small by today’s standards. The car comes standard with Bluetooth streaming audio and USB/iPod compatibility. Our test car had the optional Harman Kardon premium surround-sound audio, whose crisp sound quality impressed. It’s part of a $3,270 Premium Package, which also includes a navigation system, Mercedes’ AirScarf neck-heating system and a backup camera. That’s right: A backup camera, standard on a Honda Civic, remains optional on the $68,000-plus E550 Cabriolet.\n\nMercedes’ mbrace2 telematics service and iPhone-enabled Drive Kit add apps galore, but mbrace2 requires a subscription after the free three-month trial.\n\nCargo & Storage\nGiven its exceptional quietness — a typical disadvantage versus hardtop convertibles — the E550 Cabriolet’s soft-top has a lot of upsides. The trunk boasts 11.5 cubic feet of space with the top up, which is short of the coupe (13.3 cubic feet) and sedan (15.9 cubic feet).\n\nThe three-layer top folds into the upper portion of the trunk, separated by a semi-rigid partition that deploys downward from the rear deck. The top won’t power down unless the partition is deployed — a half-baked provision that preserves space for the folding top but allows bulky cargo to poke it upward, set off the sensors and stop the top moving down. Still, the usable space around the partition amounts to a decent 8.8 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe E-Class Cabriolet has not been crash-tested, and because of its structural differences, the results from the coupe and sedan don’t apply. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nMercedes’ standard Attention Assist system studies various driving parameters to intuit if you’re tired, then alert you to take a break. Also standard, a forward-collision warning system called Collision Prevention Assist employs radar to detect an obstacle and prime the brakes for faster action.\n\nThe sky’s the limit with safety options. Blind spot and lane departure warning systems are optional on both E350 and E550 convertibles, and a Driver Assistance Package adds Mercedes’ Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control with Steering Assist. The package also includes Mercedes’ Pre-Safe collision warning system, which augments the standard CPA with full auto-braking and pedestrian detection, plus enhanced blind spot and lane departure warning systems, which add corrective measures (mostly by braking certain wheels, in our experience) to nudge you back into your lane.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe E350 Cabriolet starts around $61,000, or $8,000 more than an E350 coupe. Another $7,100 gets you into the E550 Cabriolet, which adds no extra features save the larger engine and a few cosmetic differences. Both have standard heated leather upholstery and power front seats, but extras like navigation, premium Nappa leather, upgraded audio, the safety tech and keyless access with push-button start can add thousands. Get all the factory options, and the E550 Cabriolet tops out around $82,500.\n\nIt’s a curious car, this Benz. If you want to drop this sort of cash on a four-seat convertible, you’ll have a handful of European choices. The E-Class Cabriolet feels roomier and more upmarket, but less nimble, than a BMW 4 Series or Audi A5/S5/RS 5 convertible, but it’s still cheaper than most BMW 6 Series or Jaguar XK drop-tops. It’s a fish out of water — either a six-figure four-seat convertible at a steep discount or an overpriced entry-lux ragtop. I view it more as the former.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The Mercedes-Benz E400 Cabriolet is a solid, lovely, luxurious four-seat convertible that’s ready for a styling update, but it still satisfies in the ways an expensive convertible should.\n\nVersus the Competition: There’s only one other four-seat midsize luxury convertible, the BMW 640i, and while it’s been redesigned more recently, it’s not as well-equipped for the price.\n\nMercedes-Benz has updated most of its lineup in the past few years, but one of the few holdouts of the brand’s older style remains untouched. The E-Class is the company’s midsize offering, and it comes in a variety of styles — from a diesel sedan or fire-breathing, twin-turbocharged wagon to the style reviewed here: a slick, two-door, soft-top convertible.\n\nFor 2015, the E-Class has gotten a new engine: a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that is now the base engine in the coupe and convertible. Those models have been bumped up to E400 status, while the base sedans — with their naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 — remain E350s. Compare 2015 and 2014 models here.\n\nWith a new E-Class hopefully arriving soon, we took a spin in the latest E400 Cabriolet with the new turbocharged V-6 and Mercedes’ AirScarf system. Is the new powertrain enough to keep the E400 Cabriolet interesting until the next generation arrives?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe E-Class last got a styling update in 2013, but it hasn’t yet adopted the swoopy, curvaceous styling that’s appeared on every other Mercedes-Benz model in the past couple of years, like the CLA-Class, C-Class and S-Class. It still looks good, though, with sweeping lines and aggressive headlamps — and it looks especially good with the top down, thanks to a hard tonneau cover that fits over the folded roof.\n\nUnlike some other luxury marques, there’s no mistaking this car for any other brand’s; it conveys status and stately exclusivity, even in my test car’s bright red paint. The E400 Cabrio looks good with the top up, too, thanks to a pillarless door that creates one big window from the windshield to the rear glass. The next-generation model will likely toe the line with Mercedes’ new look, but you can’t go wrong with the conservative style of the current car.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new 329-horsepower, twin-turbocharged V-6 engine is a sweet motor — strong yet docile in around-town driving, explosively powerful on demand. Plant your foot and the E400 jumps with surprising responsiveness, roaring onto highway on-ramps or streaking away from stoplights. Upgrading to the V-8 in the E550 Cabrio seems like a waste of money just to get a V-8 rumble; the twin-turbo V-6 is plenty of motor for this car. It’s mated to Mercedes’ seven-speed automatic transmission, a smooth-shifting unit that always seems to have the V-6 in the right output for the situation. If it doesn’t, the shift action is quick enough that getting the V-6 ready for action is a simple matter: Press your right foot down until you feel the pedal click, and the transmission forces a downshift. It’s very useful if you want speed right now.\n\nThe E400’s handling is neutral, with a bias toward comfort over sport. Steering feel is adequate but not super-sensitive, and braking is firm but not overly confidence-inspiring. Let’s be honest: The Cabriolet’s mission in life is to be an expensive, luxurious, Southern California-lifestyle mall cruiser, not a back-road barnstormer. It succeeds wholeheartedly in this role, with calm road manners, excellent ride quality and more than enough power and speed to satisfy any driver.\n\nTop up, it’s a quiet, sedate luxury coupe. Top down, it’s an open-air grand tourer with room for four. That’s something of a rarity in the luxury world. The BMW 640i convertible is the E400’s only real competition, and it costs considerably more while delivering a similar experience.\n\nThe E400’s fuel economy is rated 20/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and my week of driving with the top down netted about 23 mpg. (Lowering the top on any convertible will negatively affect fuel economy by disrupting the aerodynamics, which is one reason you don’t see any hybrid convertibles.)\n\nOpting for the larger E550 Cabrio’s turbocharged V-8 engine will mean a drop in fuel economy to 17/26/20 mpg. As stated before, though, choosing the V-8 is really just for image purposes, not substantially better performance. The BMW 640i convertible is rated 20/31/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nUnlike some more recently updated models, like the C-Class and S-Class, the E-Class retains the angular, blocky styling of past Mercedes. It’s still attractive, well-built, nicely screwed together and made of top-quality materials, but it feels … not exactly old. We’ll call it “classic.” The E400 feels tighter than the 640i both up front and in back despite plenty of hip and headroom for all occupants.\n\nVisibility out front and to the sides is excellent thanks to the long, pillarless side windows, but seeing out back is difficult due to the standard retractable wind blocker between the backseat head restraints. It automatically rises when the top goes down but never fully retracts when the top is up. The perforated portion, which is intended to be see-through, is more opaque than I’m comfortable with. It partially obscures the view to the rear whether the top is up or down.\n\nThe available AirScarf system puts small heated air vents at neck level in the front seatbacks. Combined with the aforementioned rear air blocker and a special lip that rises out of the top of the windshield, it provides for an astonishingly comfortable top-down motoring experience in chillier weather. It’s especially useful in climates that see dramatic weather changes within just a few miles, where one side of the city can be cold and blustery while the other is clear and sweltering.\n\nThe seats are highly adjustable up front and excellently supportive, as I found after several days of long touring. Backseat legroom is a little tight versus the E-Class sedan thanks to the space eaten up by the folding top’s storage area, but if front occupants are willing to give up a bit of legroom, the E400 Cabrio can accommodate four full-sized adults — something most luxury convertibles have a hard time doing.\n\nBy comparison, the 640i convertible’s interior looks newer and fresher, though no more luxurious than the E400. It’s a couple of inches wider in the passenger compartment than the E400, as well. Front and rear legroom is nearly identical, but the 640i has a bit more headroom.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe electronic systems in the E400 are familiar by now, with a number of the expected Mercedes-Benz safety gadgets still available, like an attention monitor, lane keep assist, parking sensors and more. The controls feel as solid as Mercedes switches and buttons ever have, and the rotary knob controller for the Comand multimedia screen gets more intuitive every time I use it. Having driven newer Mercedes, I can say there doesn’t seem to be anything missing in the E400’s retinue of electronic entertainment and safety offerings, just that they aren’t presented in as modern a setting as those in the rest of the showroom.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a convertible, the E400 Cabrio’s cargo space is limited. A fold-down partition has to be in the down position in the trunk to lower the top, as the top is stored in part of the trunk. Even with the top down, however, there’s still enough room for two good-sized roll-aboard suitcases and some softer duffels. Top-up, the trunk can accommodate full-sized suitcases without a problem. Total available trunk space is 11.5 cubic feet, dropping to 8.8 cubic feet when the top is down. The longer, wider BMW 640i convertible has 12.4 cubic feet of space, but faces the same restriction when its top is lowered; its cargo space drops to just 10.6 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe convertible version of the E-Class has not been crash-tested, and it’s not likely to rate the same as the sedan, given the structural changes required to chop off the top an automobile. Having established that, the sedan earned a four-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and ratings of good in every test from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. See the crash-test ratings for the E-Class sedan here. The Cabrio doesn’t come with much in the way of standard active safety features; nearly everything is part of an option package, including lane keep assist, park assist sensors, a backup camera, a surround-view camera, distance keeping cruise control with automatic braking, forward collision warning, attention assist and blind spot warning sensors. See what comes standard on the E400 here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nA base 2015 E400 Cabriolet starts at $62,275 including a destination fee, but if you want any kind of advanced safety content you’ll need to start ticking off option packages. My test car was fully loaded and came to $74,760, including items like the Lane Tracking Package, the Parking Assist Package, the AMG Sport Package, LED headlights and much more. If you want to bump up to a V-8 E550 Cabriolet, that version starts at $68,675. Loaded up it can top $84,600. Build one your way here.\n\nThe competition for the E400 Cabrio is sparse, with only one real player offering a similar package, but at a dissimilar price. The BMW 640i convertible starts at $84,595 — $22,000 more than an E400 convertible for not that much more car (an all-wheel-drive version is available for $3,000 more). Stepping up to the bigger V-8 engine in the 650i convertible starts at $97,195. A 640i convertible equipped like my E400 Cabrio test vehicle costs more than $94,000, giving the Mercedes-Benz a decided value advantage.\n\nGiven Jaguar built just 50 XK convertibles for the 2015 model year, no other luxury automaker offers a four-passenger convertible in this size — the Audi A5, Infiniti Q50 and Lexus IS are all a size smaller in the compact class, making them more a match for Mercedes’ C-Class and BMW’s 4 Series. See how the E400 Cabrio stacks up against the 640i convertible here.\n\nemail",
