      "expert_review": "I tested the 2016 GLC across a mix of highway and mountain roads over two days, driving both all- and rear-wheel-drive GLC300s.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nWhile the outgoing GLK-Class had angular features that tried to mimic the larger G-Class, the new GLC300 is softer, with more rounded edges. If anything, the GLC300 now more closely resembles the softer edges of Mercedes-Benz sedans and SUVs such as the GLE-Class rather than the G-Class.\n\nWhile the GLC does lose the angular, chiseled styling that helped make the GLK-Class distinct, I think the new look is more modern and fits better with the rest of the Mercedes-Benz family.\n\nFinally, the GLC is 5.06 inches longer and 2.1 inches wider than the outgoing model. At least from the outside, though, it doesn’t appear appreciably bigger. To my eyes, that’s a good thing.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe GLC300 is powered by a 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s matched to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Mercedes said it tuned the turbocharger so it provides more power at the low end for an engine with more “grunt,” and that the new engine shouldn’t make people miss the GLK-Class’ V-6 engine. But I’m not prepared to say I don’t miss the V-6, because with the added weight of all-wheel drive, the performance in the GLC300 didn’t blow me away.\n\nSpecifically, the engine is underwhelming off the line, though once you’re moving there’s good response. Performance is better with rear-wheel drive,  but I wonder how many SUV buyers are going to want to live without all-wheel drive.\n\nStandard in the GLC is what Mercedes calls its Dynamic Select system, which lets you switch from Comfort to Eco to Sport or aggressive Sport Plus modes. This alters both the steering feel and the transmission response, but no mode fully overcomes the GLC’s initial lag from a standstill.\n\nHowever, I liked the Dynamic Select system because there are clear differences between the modes. In Sport, and especially Sport Plus, you really notice the transmission holding on to lower gears longer and the engine winding itself out, plus the steering offers more feedback. If it’s not spectacular, it’s at least satisfying to drive it this way, especially on twisty, hilly roads.\n\nThe real stars of the GLC’s driving experience are its overall dynamics and ride quality. The GLC was able to absorb bumps in the road, yet not demonstrate any body roll. It just felt like it was gripping the road, especially in the all-wheel-drive version. That kind of security was welcome in the really twisty parts of my route.\n\nMercedes-Benz will offer an optional air suspension, but I was only able to test models equipped with the traditional steel springs. In the past I’ve been wowed by the abilities of Mercedes’ air suspensions, but this car has me questioning whether I’d really want to spend the extra money for the optional air suspension — that’s how good the conventional setup was.\n\nRoad noise is acceptable for the compact luxury SUV class. I found the GLC to allow slightly more noise into the cabin than the Audi Q5, but less than the Acura RDX. In terms of Mercedes’ lineup, the noise level is comparable to a C-Class — so it’s quiet, but not “cone-of-silence” quiet, like the S-Class.\n\nThe GLC’s fuel economy had not been tested by the EPA as of publication, so no estimates are available.\n\nInterior\n\nYou really notice the fact that the GLC300 is larger than the GLK-Class in the front seat. (The GLK always felt slightly narrow to me, leaving me feeling like I was sitting snugly with my passenger.)\n\nThe front doors are sculpted out in such a way that your outside arm isn’t pinned in by the door, but there’s still plenty of room for your inboard elbow. My driving partner and I were both larger guys, and we never once bumped elbows in two days of driving.\n\nIt’s the same story in back: The seating area is large, and I wasn’t hurting for head or shoulder room. My legs also had good space and my knees weren’t raised too high in the air. That’s appreciated, especially when you’re 6 feet, 2 inches tall like I am.\n\nAlso, cabin quality is very good for the compact luxury SUV class. The GLC adopts the styling of Mercedes’ C-Class sedan, and that’s a nice choice. In addition, a more upscale designo treatment is available, as are various trim options.\n\nOverall, it’s well-executed both in how things look and how they feel. Comparing it to an RDX or Q5, I’d say the GLC300 — like the Q5 —has the right amount of buttons and controls without presenting an overwhelming array, like the Acura does.\n\nIt does, however, carry over the “floating tablet” center screen that some find objectionable, but it’s becoming more commonplace across both the Mercedes lineup and the market at large.\n\nFinally, visibility in the GLC-Class is quite good. While the SUV is larger than before, it doesn’t feel like it has become unmanageably large, and that’s partially down to its good visibility. It’s easy to put the GLC300 right where you want to — a point I proved by making a few tight parking maneuvers during my drive.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe big news here is that Mercedes-Benz has fixed an issue we’ve had with its Comand multimedia system: The touch-pad can now be turned off.\n\nThe Comand system uses a rotary controller or a touch-pad to accept inputs. The issue is that the touch-pad is positioned over the rotary controller, so it’s easy to accidentally activate the touch-pad or bring up the wrong screen with the palm of your hand while you’re using your fingers to twirl the wheel. Now that the touch-pad can be disabled, that issue doesn’t happen, making the system much easier to live with.\n\nAside from what I’d call “touch-pad interference,” I’ve always found the Comand system to excel in its ability to swap between menus such as navigation, music and so on, and this version is no different.\n\nConsidering the Mercedes system versus ones from Acura and Audi, all are similar in that they use a rotary knob to make selections, and all are similar in ease of use. I do find the Audi system — with its buttons to swap between navigation, entertainment, etc. — the easiest one to use, but with the ability to turn off the Comand touch-pad, Mercedes is now right up there with Audi, and both are ahead of the Acura system.\n\nAlso, the floating screen — at least in the GLC — is so close to the driver you could be forgiven for thinking it’s a touch-screen, but it’s not. It’s the kind of thing you get used to, but its proximity was almost annoying at first.\n\nFinally, an ergonomic setup I really loved was the toggle switch that changes driving modes. It’s intuitive, in that pushing it forward dialed up the performance — from Eco to Comfort to Sport to Sport Plus — and toggling it back dialed down the performance. It’s much easier than the stand-alone “Eco” mode buttons some other systems use.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe cargo area is also bigger and better shaped than in the previous model, and it has a few new tweaks that really come in handy. Specifically, instead of a normal cargo floor that can be lifted up to expose more cargo area, Mercedes made the cargo floor panel lockable, making the under-floor storage that much more secure. A power liftgate is standard on the GLC300.\n\nFinally, for those of us who like to haul long things and have to regularly fold seats, the rear seats in the GLC fold down via switches you tug in the cargo area. It’s a setup that’s growing more common these days, but Mercedes takes it a step further: If the front seats are set so far back they would prevent the rear seats from folding forward, the system will move the front seats forward to allow the rear seats to fold. No more do you have to run to the front of the vehicle to move the front seats.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nNotable standard safety features include Collision Prevent Assist Plus, which provides a visual and audible warning when a safe distance to the car ahead is not maintained. There’s also a standard backup camera and crosswind assist, which helps keep the GLC on track in heavy crosswinds.\n\nSafety options include adaptive cruise control — called Distronic Plus with Steering Assist — which can help keep the car centered in its lane on straight roads, maintain a set distance between the GLC and the car ahead, and bring the GLC to a complete stop. You can also add front and rear cross-traffic assist — called BAS plus with cross-traffic assist — which alerts drivers to cross traffic at intersections or when reversing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nMeasured against its competitors, the GLC300 offers a more luxurious cabin than the Acura RDX, but largely matches the RDX in handling and acceleration. The Audi Q5 matches the GLC in terms of its luxurious interior, but I don’t find it can match the GLC300’s handling and overall dynamics.\n\nSo, too, is it with price. The two-wheel-drive GLC300 starts at $39,875 (all prices include destination), compared with $36,210 for the RDX and $41,825 for the lowest-priced Q5 (all Q5 models come with all-wheel drive). Stepping up to all-wheel drive will cost you $41,875 for the GLC300 and $37,710 for the RDX. While the RDX is cheaper by a few thousand dollars than the GLC300 in either comparison, it’s not enough cheaper to make it the slam-dunk winner, and the Q5 is competitively priced compared to the GLC300. Compare the models here.\n\nTaken on its own as the small SUV in Mercedes’ lineup, the GLC300 is more comfortable and practical than the GLK, thanks to its larger size, cargo amenities and interior quality. Its performance with all-wheel drive, though, is a bit underwhelming in the push-you-back-in-the-seat-and-rocket-forward department, but it really wouldn’t be fair to call it bad.\n\nAll in all, the GLC300 will have people forgetting its predecessor in short order, so thorough and comprehensive are the improvements. And it’s a competitive entrant in the compact luxury SUV class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict:  If you can look past its frustrating touch-sensitive controls, the redesigned 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 compact SUV is a luxurious, comfortable and smooth operator.\n\nVersus the competition: The latest interior upgrade and excellent driving dynamics help to cement the GLC’s position as a leader in this luxury class, but it’s smaller than some front-wheel-drive-based competitors, with less backseat room and a tighter cabin.\n\nThe compact luxury SUV category is a hot one right now, with the entry-level models playing a critically important role in attracting new customers to their respective brands. Mercedes-Benz’s entry, the GLC SUV that’s based off the C-Class sedan platform hasn’t had a big update since its introduction as a 2016 model. With the C-Class getting a big redo for 2022, we knew the more popular GLC wouldn’t be far behind, and here it is.\n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class: Trickling Down the Tech\n\nThe GLC is among Mercedes’ most popular models in the U.S., so big changes weren’t expected — and big changes were not delivered. But that’s OK; the GLC had a winning formula, so the automaker just improved on what it was already apparently doing right. But part of those changes involved updating the GLC’s interior with a lot more touch-sensitive panels and controls, something that we have not enjoyed in other Mercedes-Benz products. Do the same frustrations now apply to the GLC SUV?\n\nYep. You better believe it. Here we go again.\n\nSquint if You Need To\n\nWe’ll start with the styling, which wasn’t broken before and hasn’t been with the extremely mild update for 2023. Believe it or not, a lot has changed from the ‘22 to ‘23 GLC — it’s more than 2 inches longer overall. But from a styling standpoint, the headlights and grille are new, and the taillights are a bit slimmer. The SUV’s width is unchanged, but subtle design changes are meant to emphasize width over tallness. The outgoing GLC was an attractive, if not terribly distinctive, SUV that was very much in keeping with the look of the rest of the Mercedes-Benz lineup, and the new one just furthers that aesthetic.\n\nWith the arrival of the Mercedes-EQ electric vehicle lineup and its jellybean looks, it seems there’s been some effort to have the internal-combustion models more closely resemble the electrics, as evidenced by the shape of the grille and headlights. It’s subtle enough, however, that most people are likely to have a hard time distinguishing a ‘22 from a ‘23 model — at least from the outside.\n\nCareful What You Touch\n\nThat won’t be a problem on the inside, as the new interior apes what Mercedes has done in the C-Class. The previous central touchscreen and physical controls below it have been replaced by a vertically oriented 11.9-inch touchscreen that’s next to a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. The new touchscreen is larger, clearer and features the latest MBUX multimedia system for greater functionality and features. However, the loss of buttons and physical controls for both audio and climate control functions is a move in the wrong direction. Increasingly, German luxury automakers are confusing “technology” with “luxury” by loading a ton of features into a confusing display that’s distracting and difficult to use on the fly, and also loses the kind of tactile feedback you get from quality buttons and switches. The MBUX system’s voice controls can help, but you don’t always want to have a conversation with your car when a simple button push would do.\n\nThat touchy problem continues on the steering wheel, where Mercedes has included the latest touch-sensitive controls on the spokes of the wheel. That means there are now areas of the steering wheel you can’t touch unless you want to change a setting, or the volume, or another feature. Having an area of the steering wheel you can’t touch is bonkers to my mind, but welcome to the latest and greatest.\n\nThese really are the only two issues in what is otherwise a lovely update to the interior. The cabin materials in the 2023 GLC look more upscale and luxurious than in the outgoing model, and even the MB-Tex imitation leather looks and feels high-quality; you’ll never miss real cowhide. The front seats feel lifted right out of the C-Class — they’re comfortable and supportive, and of actually adequate size for big Americans, something that can sometimes be an issue in the compact SUV class. The backseat is a little tight in the legroom department, something that isn’t an issue with the GLC’s front-drive-based competitors, but it’s not an impossible place to spend time. Negotiations between front- and rear-seat passengers will have to happen in order to get adequate rear legroom, but there’s plenty of headroom in the GLC’s backseat and the available panoramic moonroof helps the space feel airy.\n\nCargo capacity is up from the prior GLC even if passenger space isn’t, and that’s always a welcome development. The roughly 2.5 inches of increased overall length versus the outgoing model seems to have all gone to the back, where you now get 21.9 cubic feet of cargo room, according to Mercedes-Benz measurements, instead of 19.4 cubic feet in the old model. Knock the rear seatbacks down and you have even more space, but Mercedes hasn’t published just how much just yet.\n\nA Solid Standard Powertrain\n\nOne area of improvement that was decidedly successful was the powertrain, as the GLC300 is now fitted with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system augmenting its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It makes 255 horsepower, the same as before, but torque increases from 273 to 295 pounds-feet. A standard nine-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear wheels or all four if you opt for the 4Matic all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe GLC300 is good for what Mercedes-Benz says is a 6.2-second 0-60 mph time, and after spending a few days with the SUV, I believe it. The powertrain is quick and responsive, and unlike some competitors, it reveals no sign that it’s a mild-hybrid system. There’s no obvious distinction between electric and gasoline power in the GLC, it’s just a smooth, seamless rush when you plant your right foot. The transmission’s shifts are just as silky, without any harshness or abruptness or the annoying rubber-band sensations that plague Mercedes’ dual-clutch automatic transmissions in the GLB and GLA SUVs. There are different drive modes if you want something more aggressive and sporty, but it’s a fine-driving SUV in its normal mode.\n\nThe steering is highly boosted, which is expected — ease of use is generally valued more highly than sporting character in this class. The rear-drive nature of the GLC really only comes through when you’re flogging the thing through twisty roads, something that most of them aren’t likely to experience in the course of normal family duty. Overall, the GLC drives like an expensive vehicle. Ride and handling is nicely balanced, with well-controlled body roll and a supple ride. Noise isolation is excellent, too. Combined with the comfortable ride, the experience is more limousine than sports sedan, but that’s exactly what buyers are looking for in this class.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMercedes-Benz Releases Pricing for 2023 GLC, Starts at $48,250\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe Brings Electrified Power, Off-Road Tech\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\nResearch Mercedes-Benz Models\nShop for a 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe new GLC hews to Mercedes-Benz’s new trim strategy, with a trio of trims called Standard, Exclusive and Pinnacle. The cheapest GLC300 Standard with rear-wheel drive begins at $48,250 (all prices include $1,150 destination fee), with the Exclusive ringing in at $50,500 and the Pinnacle starting at $52,600. The 4Matic all-wheel-drive system adds a flat $2,000 to these prices. My test vehicle was a GLC300 Exclusive with RWD and a few careful options, including the Driver Assistance Package, 19-inch wheels and a panoramic moonroof; it rang in at an as-tested price of $55,550.\n\nThat’s nowhere near the top end of how the GLC can be equipped and priced, but it’s solidly smack in the middle of the segment from a pricing standpoint, meaning Mercedes-Benz is keeping the GLC in the fight for buyers in this competitive class. The car itself is a solid offering, and if you can get past the massively annoying touch-sensitive controls, it’s a worthy competitor in the class.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "You don’t need me to tell you that SUVs are selling like crazy right now. You’re probably thinking of buying one yourself. Maybe you’re thinking of buying this one, the updated 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC. You wouldn’t be alone — the GLC-Class has become Mercedes-Benz’s best-selling model in the United States, surpassing the C-Class compact sedan. And for good reason: For a few bucks more than the C-Class, you get more space, more headroom and the same quality interior, top-notch amenities, modern multimedia system and loads of extra-cost safety equipment. For 2020, Mercedes-Benz has updated the styling, powertrains and some interior bits to keep its most popular model on top.\n\nWe drove the revised 2020 GLC300 and AMG GLC63 at its U.S. launch in New Jersey and upstate New York. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC300: Don’t Judge This Benz by Its Cover\n\nThe Best Seller: GLC300\n\nThe base model sold in the U.S. is the GLC300, equipped with a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a nine-speed automatic transmission, with rear- or optional all-wheel drive. It makes 14 more horsepower than the outgoing model, but torque is unchanged at a stout 273 pounds-feet. It’s smooth and punchy, but suffers from a bit of lag on initial acceleration. I’m not sure if it’s the transmission tuning or actual engine turbo lag, but there’s a noticeable hesitation between the actions of your right foot and the response in terms of vehicle acceleration. Switching the drive mode into one of the sportier settings (Sport and Sport Plus are available) doesn’t seem to help much with the responsiveness, but it does change the behavior of the transmission to keep it in a lower gear. It doesn’t negatively impact the overall feel of the 300, which is tuned more for comfort than sport anyway, but it does become noticeable when you call for quick acceleration.\n\nComfort is more the 300’s game. While it is a bit tight inside due to it being a compact crossover SUV, it’s still a very comfortable cabin with highly adjustable seats, decent legroom for front-seat passengers and plenty of headroom. Backseat passengers are a bit more cramped, but it’s comparable to competitors like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio or Jaguar F-Pace. What you’ll notice most is the quietness: The engine itself is impressively muted, there is absolutely no wind noise even at highway speeds, and the road noise through the tires is hushed. It’s an astonishingly serene driving experience for a compact crossover, evidently the beneficiary of trickle-down design and technology from its bigger SUV brothers in the Mercedes-Benz showroom. Steering is heavily boosted, especially at lower speeds, but still stable and well-controlled, especially as speeds start to climb.\n\nThe only issue I have with the GLC300’s driving dynamics is the ride quality, which is surprisingly stiff. I credit my test vehicle’s 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires as the culprit here. While the wheels served to spice up the looks of the GLC quite nicely and offered plenty of grip, the thin sidewall tires definitely transmitted a lot of New Jersey’s broken pavement harshness to the cabin, where even the copious levels of sound and body insulation couldn’t quite filter out the worst of the bumps. Going for the standard 18-inch wheels may not be quite as sexy, but if you live anywhere that has changing seasons and the resulting road surface conditions that come with that, you’ll appreciate the taller sidewall tires’ ability to soak up bumps a lot more than the bigger wheels’ looks.\n\nRefined Technology\n\nGLC interior updates are minor but welcome. The biggest change comes with the introduction of the MBUX multimedia system, Mercedes’ next-generation touchscreen-based system that provides a streamlined user interface and some really slick features not seen on any other automaker’s vehicles. Yes, you can plug in your personal electronics and use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but you’d be missing out on the navigation system’s eye-popping augmented reality, turn-by-turn directional arrows. A forward-facing camera shows you the view ahead and upon approaching a turn, a magic arrow appears floating on the screen. The only way this would be cooler is if it was projected onto the windshield itself. The drawback to having the MBUX system in a Mercedes-Benz is that you cannot actually say the word “Mercedes” while you’re in the car, or it will activate the Siri/Alexa-style voice concierge, interrupting your music or conversation, and forcing you to once again grumble “Cancel!” at the car for accidentally triggering the “Hey Mercedes” voice control function. Most annoying.\n\nA new steering wheel is present, and while that’s not usually grounds for being called out in a review, the new one here includes Mercedes-Benz touch-sensitive five-way controllers on each spoke. They work as well here as they do in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles — meaning not well. Having anything touch-sensitive on a steering wheel seems to me to be a ridiculous idea, as it means you focus on avoiding putting your hands in certain places, and you’ll occasionally find you’ve changed a setting or channel, or switched songs when you didn’t intend to, thanks to the touch-sensitive buttons.\n\nThe only other major development for the GLC is the new offering of additional driver safety technology in the form of Active Distance Assist Distronic and Active Steering Assist. This brings some of the semi-autonomous driving functions of other Mercedes-Benz models to the GLC, including automatic lane change using just the turn signal, and automatic slowing of a vehicle under cruise control when approaching a bend or junction in the road. It works as well as it does in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles — you can’t have your hands off the wheel for too long or the car yells at you and eventually deactivates the system. But it does alleviate the burden of tedious driving along straight, boring highways or through bumper-to-bumper stop-and-go traffic.\n\nThe Spicy Alternative: AMG GLC63\n\nThe maniacs over at the AMG division applied their touch to the GLC (as they seemingly have applied their touch to everything in the Mercedes-Benz showroom these days) and crafted the Mercedes-AMG GLC63. It’s equipped with a hand-built twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 making 469 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque (or opt for the GLC63 S, which ups those numbers to 503 hp and 516 pounds-feet). All-wheel drive is standard at this point, and the nine-speed automatic gets special attention and tuning to handle all that torque. Externally, the GLC63 gets considerably different styling, with a vertical strake grille, wider fenders and bumpers, an integrated trapezoidal exhaust out back, and new LED light patterns for the headlights and taillights.\n\nThe driving experience is worlds different from the lesser GLC300 and shows you just what an electronically adjustable air suspension and a massive turbocharged V-8 can do. The whole package is a bit nuts for a compact SUV, but that’s also kind of the point of the GLC63. It’s never going to see a track and nobody would take an SUV out for a club track day event, but out on the street, the combination of much more aggressive, fat-fendered styling and the brawny V-8 with its instant torque is crazy fun. The adjustability of the suspension actually means that the big wheels and tires on the GLC63 afford you a more compliant ride than the big wheel and tire package on the lesser GLC300, with its non-adjustable suspension. And when you’re ready for something more aggressive, just punch a few of the buttons on the console or steering wheel and select a sportier setting for the vehicle, amping up all of the system responses and creating a more athletic driving experience.\n\nThe Weird Ones: GLC 300 Coupe and AMG 63 Coupe\n\nWant all the high-riding style of a crossover SUV, but none of the headroom or cargo utility? Well, Mercedes-Benz is offering coupe versions of the GLC meant to go head-to-head with the BMW X4. GLC Coupes feature a chopped-top look and swoopy hatchback; it’s also available in GLC300, AMG 63 and 63 S versions. It behaves exactly like the SUV version of the GLC, with the same powertrains, same suspensions, same ride and handling characteristics. The biggest difference in how it feels stems from the loss of the GLC SUV’s excellent all-around visibility — the new, gun-slit rear window doesn’t even have a wiper, meaning your already dramatically curtailed rear view is even worse in the rain. The only reason to choose the coupe over the standard SUV is style, and that’s of questionable taste given that the choice of the coupe model comes with the stigma anyone conversant in automobiles recognizes as “you’ve spent a lot of money on something silly.” Our advice: Stick with the already stylish SUV version, and if you must have something more stylish, pop that extra cash into the AMG version, which provides both extra style and a lot more entertainment value.\n\nGLC300, AMG GLC63 Pricing: Luxury and Speed Never Come Cheap\n\nStarting price for the rear-wheel-drive 2020 GLC300 is $43,495 including destination fee. That price bumps up to $45,495 if you want 4Matic all-wheel drive and $50,995 if you want the GLC300 Coupe. Start adding safety features and fancy interior bits like the stellar heads-up display, and that number quickly climbs. The as-tested price for my loaded GLC300 4Matic came to an eye-popping $63,835. That’s not even for the AMG version, which starts at $74,745 for the GLC63 and $85,095 for the GLC63 Coupe. Load up a GLC63 S Coupe and you’re coming perilously close to the $100,000 mark, which is a lot of money for a compact SUV\n\nDespite the formidable price, this still is Mercedes-Benz’s most popular model — and for good reason. The combination of refinement, comfort, technology, safety, efficiency and utility for the GLC300 is definitely a winning one. Yes, it’s expensive, but its customers don’t seem to mind, finding value in the price commensurate with the experience of owning one (or, more likely, leasing one). If you want the best GLC you can get, the AMG GLC63 is worth the extra cost, providing a highly entertaining driving experience and an opulent, technology-packed cabin.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC?\n\nThe GLC is Mercedes-Benz’s entry in the luxury compact SUV class, and it’s available in a traditional SUV shape as well as a sloped-roof coupe version. Both body styles seat five people. GLC300 models are powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine matched with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The standard body style comes with rear- or all-wheel drive, while coupe versions come only with AWD. A high-performance AMG GLC43 version gets a 416-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, also augmented by a 48-volt hybrid system, along with a sport-tuned suspension and other performance-focused features.\n\nGLC competitors include the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Genesis GV70. The GLC Coupe’s rivals include the Audi Q5 Sportback, BMW X4 and Infiniti QX55.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC?\n\nThe basic GLC300 was redesigned for 2023, but its GLC300 Coupe and AMG GLC43 stablemates carried over unchanged. For 2024, the coupe and AMG versions catch up; they’ve been redesigned on the same new platform that debuted with the 2023 GLC300. The new AMG GLC43’s 416-hp four-cylinder replaces the previous GLC43’s 385-hp, twin-turbo V-6.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel \nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\n18-inch aluminum wheels \nSix-speaker audio system \nAutomatic headlights and high beams \nHands-free power liftgate \nPower-folding side mirrors \nHeated front seats with memory\nImitation leather upholstery \nPower windows and locks \nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel \nRemote keyless entry and push-button start\nDual-zone climate control \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNavigation with augmented reality \n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display \nPremium audio system   \nPanoramic sunroof\nVentilated seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather upholstery \nNappa leather upholstery\nHeated rear seats\nAdaptive cruise control with lane centering \nAWD (standard on coupe and AMG trims)\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLC300 is a well-equipped luxury compact SUV that offers genuinely posh trimmings and plenty of options to satisfy a variety of buyers. Those who put a premium on style can choose the coupe, while those who want serious muscle can opt for the AMG GLC43. Higher trims demand serious dough, however, and all GLCs have touch-sensitive controls that can be frustrating to use. The GLC’s backseat room and cargo space also trail some class rivals.",

      "expert_review": "A redesigned GLC touched down for the 2023 model year, and Mercedes-Benz has been busy filling out the model line ever since, with the fastback GLC Coupe and AMG high-performance models. Things are getting really wild in the GLC house for 2025, with the new plug-in hybrid GLC350e and the AMG GLC63 S E Performance. All 2025 GLCs also benefit from more standard equipment, including a third-generation infotainment interface, digital key capability that allows owners to use their phone as a vehicle key, and a center airbag between front-seat occupants. For 2025, the Mercedes GLC starts at $50,400 for the SUV and $60,450 for the Coupe (all prices include the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC350e Review: Use It or Lose It\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nSUV\nGLC300: $50,400\nGLC300 4Matic: $52,400\nGLC350e 4Matic: $61,050\nAMG GLC43: $68,250\nAMG GLC63 S E Performance: $87,200\nCoupe\nGLC300 4Matic: $60,450\nAMG GLC43: $74,050\nAMG GLC63 S E Performance: $92,600\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC’s Trim Levels?\n\nFrom the get-go, the GLC is equipped with the lengthy list of features one might expect of a Mercedes-Benz. Standard equipment on the GLC300 includes 18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and 64-color ambient lighting. The standard tech suite consists of wireless phone charging, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 11.9-inch touchscreen with voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nBeyond all-wheel drive, the GLC300 4Matic SUV includes no additional content, but the GLC300 4Matic Coupe gains a panoramic moonroof, 19-inch wheels and navigation. The PHEV GLC350e also includes navigation.\n\nGLC SUV buyers get the standard panoramic moonroof in the AMG 43, which in both body styles also includes an adaptive sport suspension with rear-wheel steering and 20-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, synthetic-suede seat trim and a heated steering wheel. In addition to its stratospheric output, the AMG 63 upgrades the GLC Coupe and SUV with dynamic engine mounts and even heartier braking hardware.\n\nThe non-AMG SUV can be upgraded with two optional trim packages, Exclusive and Pinnacle. Only the Pinnacle is available on the coupe and AMG models due to their greater standard content. In configurations where the features are not already standard, the Exclusive includes navigation, 15-speaker Burmester 3D audio, a 360-degree camera system, upgraded ambient lighting and a security system. The Pinnacle builds on that with upgraded headlights and a head-up display with augmented reality navigation.\n\nThe GLC’s standard safety suite is mostly consistent regardless of what powertrain buyers choose. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, automated parking and a driver attention monitor. Coupe and AMG models also include a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is available for all GLCs and adds adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, front cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering, lane change assist and emergency steering assist.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe GLC is available with a wide variety of engines, all of which are backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission. The entry-level GLC300 SUV is the only configuration with rear-wheel drive; the rest of the lineup has Mercedes’ 4Matic AWD standard.\n\nThe GLC300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 295 pounds-feet of torque. With RWD, it returns an EPA-rated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined; the 4Matic gets 23/31/26 mpg.\n\nThe GLC350e supplements the turbo 2.0-liter with a potent electric motor, raising total system output to 313 hp and 406 pounds-feet. Its 23.3-kilowatt-hour battery provides up to 54 miles of electric range. With the gas engine running, it returns an EPA-rated 64 mpg combined.\n\nIn the AMG GLC43, the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder gains an additional electrically driven turbocharger, cranking output to 416 hp and 369 pounds-feet. Whereas the non-AMG GLCs all need about 6 seconds to accelerate from 0-60, the AMG 43 can get there in just 4.7 seconds. In SUV form, it gets 19/25/21 mpg; the coupe is rated at 18/24/21 mpg.\n\nTake the AMG 43 and add a 201-hp electric motor to the rear axle and you’ve got the AMG63 S E Performance and a total of 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet. Its 6.1-kWh battery is only good for a mile or so of electric travel, but the AMG63 is rated at 31 mpg combined and needs only 3.5 seconds to accelerate to 60 mph.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe Review: Fancy, Fast and Flawed\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC43 Coupe?\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
