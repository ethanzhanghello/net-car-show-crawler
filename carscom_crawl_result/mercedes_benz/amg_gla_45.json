      "expert_review": "The 2018 Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 compact SUV is a bona fide AMG product just like the rest of Mercedes-Benz’s high-performance, range-topping AMG lineup: It has a hand-built, 375-horsepower powerhouse engine under the hood and a totally unique driving experience compared with the regular  Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. The AMG GLA 45 starts life as a little SUV — truly little; the GLA 250 is small for its class — and dumps the ride height thanks to a lowered suspension, then adds 167 horsepower and gets a 167-mph top speed.\n\nNew for 2018\n\nThere are few changes to the GLA 45 for 2018 besides a slight styling update up front. The tweaked nose has new, vertically slotted grille intakes and a silver front splitter insert. Mercedes-Benz says the slotted grill intakes are functional and help provide airflow to the radiators. Out back, a new diffuser insert adds a racier look, while Mercedes says the roof-mounted lip spoiler is functional.\n\nThat all sounded nice — until I gazed upon my Kryptonite Green Metallic test car with an optional high-mounted black rear spoiler and 20-inch AMG multispoke wheels. Around the office, we called it the “snot rocket.” At an as-tested price of $71,000, the ostentatious paint and tacked-on spoiler were too much for me. Maybe they would be just the right amount of “Fast and Furious” for you.\n\nAcceleration\n\nFew cars have as big a range of acceleration and throttle responsiveness as the Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 does thanks to its various driving modes. Somewhere between the least-aggressive Comfort mode and the appropriately named — and optional — Race mode, Mercedes seemingly uncorks the engine’s additional 167 hp. In Comfort mode, the engine is tame, the turbocharger responds slowly and there’s not much oomph under the accelerator pedal. Plus, the transmission shifts lazily. The experience is exceptionally unexceptional.\n\nYou better have a clear section of road ahead when you flick into Race mode, because this little booger flat out rips. The transmission builds engine revs from a stop for quicker launches, and the engine comes alive with crisp accelerator response and pulling power; it feels every bit as strong as its 375 hp suggests. It’s impressive, especially considering how easy it is for a small-displacement, high-powered four-cylinder to have finicky power delivery, such as too much mid-range power or nothing until the top of the rev range. The AMG has a bunch of punch all over the power band.\n\nRace mode isn’t viable every day, as the transmission hangs onto gears excruciatingly long and upshifts reluctantly. That was perfect on the racetrack, but less desirable around town. The next-least-aggressive mode, Sport +, is more livable, but still decently peppy around town.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nEven the presence of Comfort mode doesn’t make the GLA 45 a very livable everyday commuter. Our test car was optioned with the AMG Dynamic Plus suspension, a package for dedicated trackgoers that also includes a limited-slip front differential and Race mode. The optional suspension certainly livens up the GLA 45’s handling performance, but it sacrifices ride quality. I did not enjoy driving the GLA45 around Chicago, but wow did it come alive on Joliet’s Autobahn Country Club’s north circuit, with flat handling and tenacious grip from the all-wheel-drive system that made the track experience a breeze. The GLA45 feels safely planted even near its traction limits — and those limits are pretty high.\n\nEveryday Livability (or Lack Thereof)\n\nThe GLA 45 isn’t a great SUV. It’s a fantastic sports car, or perhaps a hot hatchback like a Ford Focus RS or Honda Civic Type R (though smaller). But the backseat is laughably small compared with an Audi A3 sedan or the supersized (relatively speaking) BMW X1 SUV, and that’s a fundamental issue with the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class in any configuration. However, it’s less of an issue if you consider the GLA45 a sports car. Sports cars, of course, aren’t often purely practical purchases.\n\nNot practical at all are the optional, bulky AMG Performance Seats that jut into the GLA 45’s backseat space, but they’re grippy and keep a firm hold on front occupants — almost too firm. As a skinny guy, I felt the side bolsters were excessive even with their adjustability fully relaxed.\n\nFor the Money\n\nThe AMG GLA 45 is a better impractical sports car than the GLA 250 is a practical small SUV. Despite a small backseat and cargo area, this chassis has more room than coupes like the BMW M2 or Audi TTS, which are around the same price. The GLA 45 we drove was loaded with optional equipment that gave it a $71,000 price tag, but you can get all the important performance stuff in the mid-$50,000 range; it starts at $51,595 with destination.\n\nAudi’s RS3 sedan is a more direct competitor, but is available only as a sedan in the U.S. The M2 and TTS are thoroughbreds in this price range, but if you need two more doors and cargo versatility, the AMG GLA 45 nicely fills that void.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: If you for some reason need a super-quick, tech-laden, very expensive small crossover that sits high and doesn’t feel terribly sporty (aside from rapid acceleration), the Mercedes-AMG GLA45 is the one for you.\n\nVersus the competition: Few automakers make high-performance SUVs this small; most are a class larger (BMW X3 M, Audi SQ5, Alfa Romeo Stelvio QV), making the GLA45 more distinctive — but not more appealing.\n\nRemember sports sedans? How you could buy a compact, high-powered, low-to-the-ground sedan or hatchback that didn’t have a lot of room inside, but delivered an amazing number of smiles per miles thanks to robust acceleration and quick reflexes?\n\n“OK boomer,” as the kids would say. Shoppers today clamor for SUVs and crossovers — which are basically tall wagons based on not-terribly-enjoyable vehicles — not sports sedans. So instead of delivering sports sedans, the trend today is for automakers to deliver vehicles like the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLA45. And I have to say it: Each new high-performance crossover equipped with aggressive tires, crazy track-oriented electronic lap timers and other performance-oriented frippery feels more ridiculous than the last. These cars will never turn a wheel in anger on a racetrack; no driving enthusiast is clamoring to drive a tall, high-chaired wagon on a road course. But apparently there are plenty of buyers eager to spend money on a badged-up, super-quick, performance-branded crossover.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250: Higher Profile, Higher Price\n\nIt’s Not Very Ugly\n\nThe GLA is the crossovered version of the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. It’s taller but has a similar footprint, and it maintains the familiar overall look of the latest Mercedes SUVs. There’s a central wide-mouth grille flanked by slim LED headlights out front, with a plain but inoffensive bodyside and individual taillights in back. It’s a surprisingly generic look — one that’s been copied by other automakers (notably, South Korean ones) but soldiers on.\n\nAMG is Mercedes-Benz’s performance division — or at least, it used to be. Now they’ll put the badge on just about anything in the lineup once they’ve applied a certain performance formula to turn it into a quicker, more aggressive and ostensibly sportier — if increasingly less exclusive — version of itself.\n\nMercedes adds its own styling touches to anything with an AMG badge, and the GLA45 is no exception. There’s a more aggressive grille and bumper combo, fender flares to cover the wider 19-inch wheels and tires, and dual exhaust out back. It’s not a bad-looking effect, and it does give the boring GLA some additional street presence. You can even opt for a ridiculous wing on the back (which my test vehicle thankfully did not have).\n\nPerhaps the GLA45 would benefit from not being painted white, which made the one I drove look like a rental Hyundai. An all-black scheme would positively transform this awkward hatch/wagon into a more convincing sports machine. As tested, though, it’s nothing to get your heart racing.\n\nQuick but Problematic Around Town\n\nThe heart of the GLA45 is its revised, hand-built turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, which Mercedes says is the most powerful four-cylinder engine ever put into a production car. It cranks out an eye-popping 382 horsepower and 351 pounds-feet of torque, which is more grunt than many naturally aspirated V-8 engines produce. It’s mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels; all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nMercedes says the engine is good for a 4.3-second sprint from 0-60 mph, and based on my seat-of-the-pants testing, there’s no reason to doubt that claim. The GLA45 feels incredibly quick when you mash the throttle. The problem is that the transmission doesn’t really want to accommodate this kind of behavior, so you don’t end up with a vehicle that feels nimble, sprightly and agile. Instead, it feels tepid and lethargic — unless you’ve dialed all the sport modes to maximum, which is not conducive to around-town driving.\n\n2021 Mercedes-AMG GLA45 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nThe problem, I’m convinced, remains the dual-clutch transmission’s behavior. It feels like it gets confused when you slow down for an urban street corner, then get back on the throttle if you decide you don’t need to stop; it hesitates for a half-second when you go from coast-down to power-on. It makes the accelerator pedal feel like it’s connected by rubber bands, with powertrain response coming a half-step behind your right foot’s request. It makes for a very frustrating around-town driving experience. It’s something I’ve observed in other versions of Mercedes’ compact front-drive platforms, and it’s apparently not been solved in this latest go-round. It remains disappointing.\n\nThe rest of the GLA45 experience is somewhat confusing. If you’re looking for a more powerful, more aggressively styled SUV that delivers powerful acceleration, you’re in the right spot. But the GLA45’s steering isn’t what I’d call terribly communicative; it’s highly damped, and while steering effort seems to be adjustable through various AMG modes, steering feel is never all that great.\n\nRide quality, on the other hand, is excellent, even with big 19-inch AMG wheels. Suspension firmness can be adjusted, and there are even track modes for the GLA45. That just strikes me as daft: Nobody is taking an SUV to a track day, making all the engineering cost and effort that went into making and tuning these systems just silly. The GLA45 might be driven aggressively on the street, but an SUV is what you drive to a track day, not for a track day. After spending a week with this one, I had no desire whatsoever to drive it on a road circuit.\n\nComfort and Luxury Abound\n\nWhat the GLA45 really seems to be about is separating the wealthy from their money, not being an entertaining track monster for driving enthusiasts. It’s all about status symbols and badge envy — and Mercedes knows it all too well. The interior of the GLA45 proves this out: It’s loaded with luxurious appointments, beautiful switchgear, attractive seats and racy details. I maintain that Mercedes remains the benchmark for luxury car interiors, and the GLA45 is yet another example of the company’s aesthetic in action. Lots of soft-touch materials combine with real metal trim and racy leather upholstery to create an inviting, comfortable and highly attractive interior. You never really wonder why the car is so expensive when you’re in a Mercedes; looking around, touching everything, moving switches and pushing buttons all serve to reinforce the fact that you’re in something special.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable, even if getting into them can be a bit awkward. One hallmark of Mercedes’ subcompact front-wheel-drive platform is that the B-pillar is quite far forward, meaning you have to snake your body around it to get in or out of the front seats. Once inside, there’s plenty of space for adjustment in any direction, with tons of headroom overhead despite the panoramic moonroof. The backseat is less comfortable, as legroom is compromised by the GLA’s not-terribly-large footprint. Headroom isn’t a problem, but you’re reminded this is indeed a subcompact-class crossover; it’s not big in there. It’d be fine for a young couple or new family, but really, it’s meant to be a starter model for people getting into Mercedes’ lineup.\n\nThat said, it’s a perfectly adequate urban runabout, with a cargo area that can accommodate bulkier items and space for bigger gear with the backseat folded down. The latest version of Mercedes’ MBUX multimedia system remains an impressively sophisticated unit, featuring versatile voice controls, augmented reality icons for the navigation system, and even a feature that shows you traffic lights when you come to a stop — in case you’re too close and can’t see them out the windshield.\n\nWhat to Compare It With?\n\nFinding competitors for the GLA45 is not as easy as you might think. Its starting price is $55,550 (all prices include destination fee), and adding options like specialty paint, a leather interior, the panoramic roof and a fancy multimedia package drives the price up quickly. My as-tested price for a Digital White Metallic model with a black leather interior rang up at $62,150. That’s a massive amount of money for a subcompact SUV, even if the GLA45 does make up for it with a considerable amount of technology, luxurious trimmings and, let’s be honest, badge prestige.\n\nThe BMW X2 M35i comes close in size and mission, but it can’t quite match the GLA45’s numbers. It features a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 301 hp — that’s a significant 81 hp less than the Mercedes, though it also features a lot of the adjustable suspension tech and adjustability that the GLA45 does. It starts at a lower price point than the GLA45 — nearly $10,000 less, reminding you there’s a 302-hp Mercedes-AMG GLA35 that matches it closely in power and price (and that it’s a better idea). Audi has no answer to the GLA45 (or even the GLA35), and the Jaguar E-Pace 300 Sport is similarly sized but, again, not as powerful. The Porsche Macan is simply a class bigger than the GLA, matching up better with the Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nThe GLA45 is a comfortable, luxurious and very expensive small crossover with a seriously powerful engine but flawed power delivery, and a stunning amount of technology meant to let you drive it quickly on a racetrack — but it will almost certainly never see a racetrack and doesn’t really have any competitors. All that leaves us scratching our heads as to who this vehicle is for: Is it drivers who simply want more of what lesser GLAs deliver in terms of power and speed? Someone who wants the bragging rights of owning the sportiest, most powerful tiny family hauler on the market? For these people, the GLA45 will be perfect. For the rest of us, it’s just unnecessary.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250: Higher Profile, Higher Price\n2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250: L’il Fella of the Fam Gets More SUV Swag\n2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class Sparks All-Electric Incarnation in EQA\n2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 Review: Mercedes’ SUV GLAteway Drug\nMercedes SUVs: There Are Many, So Which Is Right for You?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA is a subcompact luxury SUV with seating for five and a choice of several turbocharged four-cylinder engines. The most powerful are reserved for the AMG GLA35 and AMG GLA45 variants, which offer 302 and 382 horsepower, respectively. As for the regular GLA250, it has a 221-hp, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic and your choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Performance is peppy, and fuel economy is solid for a small SUV. While the sleek shape limits the overall practicality of the GLA, it remains a refined and stylish alternative to rivals like the BMW X1, Volvo XC40, Audi Q3 and Lexus UX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThere are no notable changes or updates for the GLA range for the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nPower-adjustable front seats\nPower liftgate\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nSix-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning system\nCrosswind assist\nRain-sensing wipers \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n64-color ambient interior lighting\n10.25-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\n12-speaker Burmester audio system\nAMG Performance all-wheel-drive system\nSport exhaust\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA is an attractive and highly maneuverable pick among premium small SUVs. If rock-crawling abilities and loads of cargo space are your top priorities, however, you’ll want to look elsewhere. Its size makes the GLA easy to place exactly where you want it, and the turbocharged four-cylinder engines provide plenty of character. The AMG variants considerably amp up the GLA’s performance, but they also demand a hefty price premium over the regular GLA250.",

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 compact SUV is a bona fide AMG product just like the rest of Mercedes-Benz’s high-performance, range-topping AMG lineup: It has a hand-built, 375-horsepower powerhouse engine under the hood and a totally unique driving experience compared with the regular  Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. The AMG GLA 45 starts life as a little SUV — truly little; the GLA 250 is small for its class — and dumps the ride height thanks to a lowered suspension, then adds 167 horsepower and gets a 167-mph top speed.\n\nNew for 2018\n\nThere are few changes to the GLA 45 for 2018 besides a slight styling update up front. The tweaked nose has new, vertically slotted grille intakes and a silver front splitter insert. Mercedes-Benz says the slotted grill intakes are functional and help provide airflow to the radiators. Out back, a new diffuser insert adds a racier look, while Mercedes says the roof-mounted lip spoiler is functional.\n\nThat all sounded nice — until I gazed upon my Kryptonite Green Metallic test car with an optional high-mounted black rear spoiler and 20-inch AMG multispoke wheels. Around the office, we called it the “snot rocket.” At an as-tested price of $71,000, the ostentatious paint and tacked-on spoiler were too much for me. Maybe they would be just the right amount of “Fast and Furious” for you.\n\nAcceleration\n\nFew cars have as big a range of acceleration and throttle responsiveness as the Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 does thanks to its various driving modes. Somewhere between the least-aggressive Comfort mode and the appropriately named — and optional — Race mode, Mercedes seemingly uncorks the engine’s additional 167 hp. In Comfort mode, the engine is tame, the turbocharger responds slowly and there’s not much oomph under the accelerator pedal. Plus, the transmission shifts lazily. The experience is exceptionally unexceptional.\n\nYou better have a clear section of road ahead when you flick into Race mode, because this little booger flat out rips. The transmission builds engine revs from a stop for quicker launches, and the engine comes alive with crisp accelerator response and pulling power; it feels every bit as strong as its 375 hp suggests. It’s impressive, especially considering how easy it is for a small-displacement, high-powered four-cylinder to have finicky power delivery, such as too much mid-range power or nothing until the top of the rev range. The AMG has a bunch of punch all over the power band.\n\nRace mode isn’t viable every day, as the transmission hangs onto gears excruciatingly long and upshifts reluctantly. That was perfect on the racetrack, but less desirable around town. The next-least-aggressive mode, Sport +, is more livable, but still decently peppy around town.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nEven the presence of Comfort mode doesn’t make the GLA 45 a very livable everyday commuter. Our test car was optioned with the AMG Dynamic Plus suspension, a package for dedicated trackgoers that also includes a limited-slip front differential and Race mode. The optional suspension certainly livens up the GLA 45’s handling performance, but it sacrifices ride quality. I did not enjoy driving the GLA45 around Chicago, but wow did it come alive on Joliet’s Autobahn Country Club’s north circuit, with flat handling and tenacious grip from the all-wheel-drive system that made the track experience a breeze. The GLA45 feels safely planted even near its traction limits — and those limits are pretty high.\n\nEveryday Livability (or Lack Thereof)\n\nThe GLA 45 isn’t a great SUV. It’s a fantastic sports car, or perhaps a hot hatchback like a Ford Focus RS or Honda Civic Type R (though smaller). But the backseat is laughably small compared with an Audi A3 sedan or the supersized (relatively speaking) BMW X1 SUV, and that’s a fundamental issue with the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class in any configuration. However, it’s less of an issue if you consider the GLA45 a sports car. Sports cars, of course, aren’t often purely practical purchases.\n\nNot practical at all are the optional, bulky AMG Performance Seats that jut into the GLA 45’s backseat space, but they’re grippy and keep a firm hold on front occupants — almost too firm. As a skinny guy, I felt the side bolsters were excessive even with their adjustability fully relaxed.\n\nFor the Money\n\nThe AMG GLA 45 is a better impractical sports car than the GLA 250 is a practical small SUV. Despite a small backseat and cargo area, this chassis has more room than coupes like the BMW M2 or Audi TTS, which are around the same price. The GLA 45 we drove was loaded with optional equipment that gave it a $71,000 price tag, but you can get all the important performance stuff in the mid-$50,000 range; it starts at $51,595 with destination.\n\nAudi’s RS3 sedan is a more direct competitor, but is available only as a sedan in the U.S. The M2 and TTS are thoroughbreds in this price range, but if you need two more doors and cargo versatility, the AMG GLA 45 nicely fills that void.",
