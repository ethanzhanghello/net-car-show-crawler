      "expert_review": "Don’t let the new name fool you. The GLS-Class is a mild update, not a full redesign, of the second-generation GL-Class that began with the 2013 model year. The name is simply a result of Mercedes-Benz’ nomenclature overhaul. Compare the two luxury SUVs here.\n\nThe GLS-Class comes with a V-6 (GLS450) or V-8 (GLS550) engine, both turbocharged. There’s also a GLS350d with a turbo-diesel V-6, but, as of this writing, it’s awaiting EPA clearance amid heightened scrutiny over all things diesel. All-wheel drive and seating for seven are standard; you can compare trim levels here.\n\nCars.com covers the high-performance AMG GLS63 separately in its Research section.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a GL-Class with new headlights and grille inserts. Mercedes revised a handful of other areas, too — the bumper openings, some lower cladding and (just barely) the taillights — but those changes are even slighter. This is hardly an overhaul, and given the GL-Class’ crowd-pleasing styling, it didn’t need to be. The GLS550 has a meaner, hunkered-down look with gaping bumper openings, but its near-$95,000 starting price is also a lot meaner on your wallet.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nEditors disagreed on the power from our GLS450’s turbocharged V-6: Some found it quick, or at least quick enough, but I deemed it only adequate; most of the engine’s reserves were needed merely to pass slower traffic. At higher speeds, the nine-speed automatic transmission resists downshifts until your right foot is halfway to the floor. One editor found accelerator response immediate, but I observed outright lag off the line. At least I found it consistent, so drivers can plan for it, and there’s a Sport mode that quickens transmission response. But those are silver linings on a sluggish cloud.\n\nThe doldrums translate to the rest of the driving experience, too. The steering wheel turns with smooth, consistent feedback, but the slow ratio, skittish tires and prodigious body roll will diminish any handling fun. Ride quality with the standard air suspension is soft but truck-like, with a creaky suspension and floaty, uncontrolled body motions over major bumps. Dump a wheel in a pothole and the GLS450 suffers lingering reverberations afterward. It’s no G-Class, but there’s a lot left to be desired.\n\nThe brakes are equally truck-like, with an inch or so of pedal travel before anything happens. The GLS550’s brakes have larger discs — probably necessary, as its turbo V-8 makes considerably more power than the 450 (449 horsepower versus 362). Adaptive shock absorbers and active stabilizer bars are also optional. If you plan any serious off-road driving, Mercedes offers an optional two-speed transfer case, locking center differential and front skid plate.\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe GLS gets high marks for practicality, but it’s hit-and-miss on the luxury front. Visibility is excellent thanks to tall windows and head restraints that nest into the seats in the second and third rows to clear up the view out back. The second row is a three-position bench (you can’t get separate captain’s chairs) that reclines but doesn’t slide forward and back. Our test car’s optional power-tumbling chairs made third-row access a cinch: One button nests the head restraint, tumbles the seat and even powers the front chairs forward if there isn’t enough clearance. Both the second and third rows have adult-friendly space. The third row treats passengers to a high seating position, big windows and padded armrests. Many second rows don’t have it this good.\n\nStitched, low-gloss materials adorn the upper dashboard and can optionally extend to the doors and lower dash. Below all the eye candy, though, the doors regress to a sea of lower-rent plastics — the sort you won’t find in an Infiniti QX80 — or, for that matter, the far cheaper Volvo XC90. The climate control knobs still employ a rickety, yesteryear design, and the center console has patches of dull, cheap plastic. The seats come standard with Mercedes’ MB-Tex vinyl, an upholstery whose vinyl-ness is obvious at this price. Optional leather comes in regular or premium Nappa grades, but it’s beyond me why Mercedes-Benz would charge extra for it in a near-$70,000 SUV. (Mercedes and BMW are regular offenders with vinyl, but GLS competitors like the QX80, Cadillac Escalade and Land Rover Range Rover Sport all have standard cowhide.)\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n\nFitted with optional Apple CarPlay (Android Auto isn’t available), the GLS-Class sorely needs a touchscreen. No tapping, pinching or swiping the optional 8-inch dash display; all the action with that screen happens through a rotary knob and touchpad on the center console, and it’s terrible. You can press down on the console touchpad to make a selection, but you can’t zoom or scroll around CarPlay’s Apple-sourced navigation system or even change menu selections. Doing any of that requires you to spin the knob to move the screen cursor to different selections and pick something. It’s time to move on from this, Mercedes, especially now that you’re attempting to support the touchscreen-oriented CarPlay.\n\nFortunately, the GLS has a good factory navigation option with sharp graphics and plenty of street labels. The three-tiered menu structure will be familiar if you own another Mercedes-Benz, but there’s a steep learning curve for the uninitiated. Two USB ports, HD radio and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming are standard. The controller-and-touchpad combo described above is optional; without it, the GLS has a simpler knob, no touchpad and a 7-inch multimedia screen. A Harman Kardon premium stereo is also optional, as is a considerably pricier Bang & Olufsen system. In-car Wi-Fi and a rear entertainment system with two screens are optional, as well.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n\nThe GLS-Class has a competitive 16 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row. It’s a cinch to fold, with standard power-folding, 50/50-split backrests that go completely down and up with one-touch controls — a significant advantage over most power folders, which require you to hold the button while the seats slowly do their thing. With the third row folded, cargo space behind the second row is 49.4 cubic feet.\n\nThe second-row chairs aren’t so easy. With cushions that need to be flipped forward before the seats fold, they take a few more steps. (The power-tumbling described above is just for third-row access; for cargo purposes, you have to manually fold them.) The resulting load floor is flat, albeit with a slight gap between the two rows. Maximum cargo volume is 93.8 cubic feet, a total that’s competitive with larger SUVs like the QX80 and Escalade.\n\nSafety\n\n\nThe GLS-Class has not been crash-tested. A backup camera and drowsy-driver detection system are standard, as is a forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking. Blind spot and lane departure warning systems are optional. Self-driving options include adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering assist, which purports to keep your car centered — not just pinballing between lane markers — given the right conditions.\n\nGo here to see a full list of standard safety equipment. Parents with small children will appreciate the GLS’ abundant Latch anchors: The second and third rows have two sets apiece, with top-tether anchors in all positions.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nPrices start around $70,000 for the GLS450, in the ballpark of the Escalades, QX80s and Range Rover Sports you’ll find in America’s tonier suburbs. Go to town on the options, though, and a loaded GLS550 can swell to more than $115,000 — tens of thousands of dollars beyond the Cadillac and Infiniti. A value choice it is not.\n\nBut the GLS still has a trump card: practicality, even for its class. At their core, SUVs should be practical no matter the price or segment. But some luxury models have sacrificed this at the altar of performance or styling. (I’m looking at you, Porsche Cayenne.) For all its flaws in drivability and luxury, the GLS still does the whole SUV thing right.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nFor 2026, the GLS three-row SUV starts at $91,500 (all prices include $1,250 destination fee).\nA new Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition on the AMG GLS63, new paint choices and new design packages for the Maybach mark the only changes to the GLS line for the new model year.\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV and its ultra-luxury Maybach GLS variant carry over into the new model year with two new exterior paint options, and a Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition can be had on the performance-oriented AMG GLS63. The 2026 GLS starts at $91,500.\n\nRelated: 2026 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition Stands Out, Subtly\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nMercedes’ largest SUV mostly carries over for 2026 in four-, six- or seven-occupant configurations. The base 450 can be optioned in new Manufaktur Silicon Grey and Manufaktur Moonlight White Magno coats. Additionally, new Night Series Exterior and Design packages are available on the Maybach GLS600. They   exclusive color choices, darkened chrome exterior accents and black 23-inch wheels with summer performance tires.\n\nThe GLS63’s special Arctic Silver Edition comes in an exclusive Manufaktur Cirrus Silver Magno (Magno is Mercedes-speak for matte). The cosmetic package adds contrasting black-and-red accents inside and out, as well as all the gloss-black exterior accents of the AMG Night Package. Red brake calipers peek out of the SUV’s matte-black 23-inch wheels that sport red rim flanges and center-cap detailing, and the interior features red-and-black Nappa leather upholstery on quilted front seats.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLS is on sale now. Full pricing for the lineup is as follows:\n\nGLS450: $91,500\nGLS580: $117,400\nAMG GLS63: $152,300\nMaybach GLS600: $181,250\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2026 GLS lineup uses a nine-speed automatic transmission and the brand’s 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. The GLS450 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and mild-hybrid system making 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque in total. Mercedes says it accelerates from 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds. The 2025 model returned 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined; that EPA rating is expected to carry over (official estimates for the 2026 lineup are not yet available, however).\n\nThe other GLS variants utilize variations of Mercedes’ famed twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. In the GLS580, the mild-hybrid V-8 generates 510 hp and 538 pounds-feet; it hits 60 mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds and should return the same 14/19/16 mpg as the 2025 version.\n\nThe 603-hp AMG GLS63 churns out 627 pounds-feet of torque and has a 0-60 mph time of just 4.1 seconds. It should maintain an EPA-rated 14/18/15 mpg for 2026.\n\nThe Maybach GLS600 splits the performance equation between the GLS580 and GLS63 and goes all in on luxury. Its V-8 makes 550 hp and 568 pounds-feet, and the SUV has a claimed 4.6-second sprint to 60 mph. The EPA rated the luxury liner at 13/18/15 mpg for 2025.\n\nRead More About the Mercedes-Benz GLS:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Review: King of the Luxury Family SUV Brawlers\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS580?\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nIs the 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 a Good SUV? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nStandard Safety Features and Equipment\n\nThe flagship GLS SUV comes well equipped (as it should for the price). The standard safety features across the lineup include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, front cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, lane departure steering assist, lane change assist, emergency steering assist, road-sign recognition and a driver attention monitor. The GLS also has a self-parking feature and a standard 360-degree camera system that helps see what’s around such a large vehicle.\n\nThe base GLS450 rides on an air spring suspension with adaptive dampers and 21-inch wheels. Mercedes upholsters the inside in synthetic leather, and the interior features power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, four-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster complements a 12.3-inch touchscreen with augmented reality navigation, voice control, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless device charging and a 13-speaker Burmester surround-sound system are also standard.\n\nThe GLS580 comes with bigger 22-inch wheels, and the price hike incorporates leather upholstery, massaging front seats with rapid heating, heated second-row seats, five-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe AMG GLS63 buttons down more power with a stiffer sport suspension and a limited-slip rear differential. It also features Nappa leather upholstery, active engine mounts, a Class IV trailer hitch and a performance exhaust. A head-up display is also standard in the AMG variant.\n\nShoppers seeking the finest in luxury without the mad power of the GLS63 can look to the ultra-luxe Mercedes-Maybach GLS600. Distinctive mono- and two-tone paint schemes and exclusive 22-inch wheel designs elevate the Maybach. It rides on Mercedes’ E-Active Body Control that proactively tweaks the suspension response at each wheel to soften bumps. The SUV’s suspension also stiffens against body roll when turning at speed, or if the GLS gets stuck, the system pumps the suspension to help loosen it.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a full-size SUV that seats up to seven people in three rows. It’s powered by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six (GLS450) or a 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (GLS580). The ultra-luxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display that takes a lot of practice to learn. GLS competitors include the BMW X7, Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nAll GLS trims get styling updates, including a larger grille, revised front bumper and new LED taillights, while the performance-focused AMG and ultra-luxury Maybach versions get model-specific trim revisions inside and out. All models now come with the latest version of Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX infotainment system and a customizable digital instrument cluster with a choice of three display layouts. A new “transparent hood” feature in off-road mode uses the surround-view camera system to provide a view underneath the vehicle. The GLS450 and GLS580 both receive a bit more power: The GLS450’s 375-hp rating represents a 13-hp bump over last year, while the GLS580’s 510-hp rating is a 27-hp bump.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo system\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nSurround-view parking camera system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo system\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all their luggage from point A to point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling thirst, there are few things to nitpick in Mercedes’ largest SUV.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS is a full-size SUV with three rows and a 362-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six (450) or 483-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (580). The ultra-luxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display (that also takes a lot of practice to learn). GLS competitors include the Audi Q7, BMW X7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nA panoramic moonroof is newly standard on every GLS, and the entry-level GLS450 4Matic now has standard metallic paint.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo\nPanoramic sunroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nSurround-view parking camera system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all their luggage from point A to point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling thirst, there are few things to nitpick with Mercedes’ largest SUV.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It’s pricey, but the posh 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class makes a solid case to be considered the S-Class of luxury SUVs.\n\nVersus the competition: The BMW X7 matches the GLS for interior luxury appointments, but the Benz beats it with its latest multimedia and suspension tech. American alternatives, meanwhile, have finally caught up in refinement, amenities and glitzy displays.\n\nFor many people, the most iconic luxury sedan in the world is the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Big, smooth and built to impeccable standards, it’s been the world standard for luxury sedans for decades. But the trend toward choosing luxury SUVs over their sedan counterparts has been strong for decades, making the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class arguably more relevant right now.\n\nFor 2020, the GLS gets a major makeover, sharing a platform with the smaller GLE mid-size SUV and receiving a full redo of its interior. It’s certainly priced to be competitive with the S-Class; the base GLS450 with a twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine is $76,945 including destination fee, and prices can stretch up over $126,000 for a well-equipped GLS580. (And just wait until an AMG version gets here, likely boosting that price even further.) Given these hefty prices, has the redesign of the new GLS truly made it a proper S-Class-level SUV?\n\nRelated:  2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class First Drive: Resetting the Luxury Bar\n\nDo You Really Need a V-8?\n\nSpacious, smooth and bristling with the latest Mercedes-Benz interior multimedia displays and powertrain and suspension technology, it truly is a luxurious (if somewhat complicated to operate) prestige SUV. The lesser model in the U.S. is the GLS450, which is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 362 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. The higher model is the GLS580, powered by a twin-turbocharged mild-hybrid 4.0-liter V-8 engine pumping out 483 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard 4Matic all-wheel drive.\n\nBoth versions are equipped with Mercedes-Benz’s EQ Boost 48-volt mild-hybrid system, though, to be honest, if that system is doing anything at all I’ve yet to figure out what it is. It’s either operating so seamlessly as to be undetectable or it isn’t doing anything and is just a marketing gimmick — either way, it’s a nonissue.\n\nThe regular turbocharged I-6 in the GLS450 is perfectly powerful, torquey, smooth and responsive. It engaged all my demands with flawless action. I had no complaints about its performance during my week with the GLS450, which included several hundred miles of running around the metro Detroit area with multiple passengers and cargo over the December holidays. It has just the right amount of exhaust noise to make you believe there’s something powerful under the hood (engine music that’s piped into the cabin), but it’s quiet and unobtrusive at highway speeds. Acceleration is perfectly adequate in Comfort mode and brisk and entertaining in Sport mode, and it never lets you down when you call upon the powertrain for more. I never ran out of oomph with the I-6 powertrain in the GLS450, regardless of driving conditions.\n\nThat made me curious about the bigger, more powerful twin-turbo V-8 in the GLS580 I tested the week after I had the 450. The bigger (but not big, compared with some competitors’ engines) V-8 definitely makes itself known when you firmly plant your right foot on the accelerator, launching the SUV with growling authority, but it doesn’t feel any quicker than the GLS450. Even the official 0-60-mph times from Mercedes-Benz don’t show a big difference in acceleration: MB says it’s 5.9 seconds for the 450 and 5.2 seconds for the 580. For 90%  of everyday driving you won’t be digging into the deep torque reserves, and when you have a truckload of passengers, neck-snapping acceleration is generally not called for.\n\nYou’ll also pay for the privilege of having the V-8 at the gas pump. The GLS450 is EPA-rated 19/23/21 mpg city/highway/combined; my week of driving averaged 19.5 mpg according to the onboard trip computer. The GLS580 is rated worse, at 16/21/18 mpg, and I averaged 15.7 mpg, again according to the computer. I chalk up my subpar fuel economy to the snow tires that both SUVs were equipped with, which likely sapped an mpg or two. So while you’re not doing yourself any favors at the pump by going with the big engine, it’s not like you’re driving a Prius with the lesser engine.\n\nThough neither SUV is super-efficient, they’re on par for the segment: The BMW X7 xDrive40i rings in at 20/25/22 mpg with its six-cylinder engine, slightly better than the base Benz. But the upgraded X7 xDrive50i twin-turbo V-8’s rating of 15/21/17 mpg isn’t as good as the V-8 GLS580’s rating. A Lincoln Navigator, which these days can be mentioned in the same breath as a Mercedes-Benz with genuine credibility, comes in at 16/22/19 mpg for the rear-wheel-drive version and 16/21/18 mpg with all-wheel drive, both equipped with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nThe ride quality of both GLS models is exceptional thanks to a standard electronically adjustable air suspension, plus an optional system called E-Active Body Control. That system uses a combination of sensors, cameras and actuators to anticipate the vehicle’s next move and adjust the body accordingly. For instance, if you’re turning into a banked curve on a highway or twisty road, forward-scanning cameras watch what’s coming and the system can tilt the GLS’ body like a motorcycle or airplane banking into the corner. It dramatically reduces the centrifugal force you would normally feel throwing you against the doors when you take a tight corner, reducing passenger fatigue and giving a better sense of control over the SUV in general. It truly is a must-have option on any Mercedes-Benz SUV that offers it; it’s a unique system not found on any competitor.\n\nBeautifully Appointed\n\nThe cabin of the new GLS-Class is fully updated to the modern Mercedes-Benz standard, and it’s a welcome change. The old cabin was getting long in the tooth, using the brand’s old-style switches and buttons, but the new ones look as fresh as anything in the lineup. Slim stalks on the steering column, excellent aluminized finish on the dashboard buttons, classy-looking genuine wood trim and luxurious-feeling high-grade leather are all in abundance. And unlike the latest Audi designs, it’s not all touch-sensitive flat plastic panels. Mercedes-Benz apparently believes (correctly, in my opinion) that you still need the feel of a switch or button to properly convey a sense of precision, price and “premiumness.”\n\nThe highlight of all the new Benz interiors is the dual electronic display screen that stretches across the dash, from the driver’s gauge cluster to the right side of the center console. In the GLS, it’s sized as two 12.3-inch screens, the right-hand one being touch-sensitive. The driver’s display can also be switched between a few different themes, and there’s a full-color, reconfigurable head-up display available so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road for critical information.\n\nThe MBUX multimedia system is standard, and it works as it does in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles — mostly good results, despite a few nagging glitches inherent in its design. There are two problem areas with the system: First is the voice recognition that’s meant to activate the Siri/Alexa-like assistant whenever you say “Hey Mercedes,” but that actually activates anytime you just say “Mercedes,” making talking about the vehicle while driving it challenging. The other trouble area is the steering wheel, which has the latest touch-sensitive five-way controllers on the spokes, meaning you have to be very careful not to touch them lest you accidentally change a setting or activate a feature. Having an area on the steering wheel that you have to consciously avoid touching while driving is lunacy, and the system is not an improvement over the old five-way controllers Mercedes-Benz used to employ.\n\nIn the end, though, you can forgive all that thanks to the comfort provided by the larger, more spacious interior versus the one it replaces. The new model has a 2.3-inch stretch to its wheelbase, which has translated into more than 3 extra inches of rear legroom thanks to a newly adjustable second row. It’s still tight in that third row for full-size humans, but it’s less of a chore to sit back there given the ability to negotiate legroom among backseat passengers. The first row of seats is multi-adjustable, as well, and outward visibility is excellent thanks to a commanding driving position and big, tall windows.\n\nCargo room is also plentiful, measuring 17.4 cubic feet behind the third row, 42.7 cubic feet behind the second row (or 48.7 cubic feet with the second row scooched all the way forward) and a maximum of 84.7 cubic feet with all the rear seats down. The BMW X7 has comparable overall volume but only 12.8 cubic feet behind the third row. There’s 48.6 cubic feet behind the second (not adjustable) row and a maximum volume of 90.4 cubic feet when all seats are folded. If cargo room is really your priority, however, you’ll want to look at a Lincoln Navigator, which boasts 20.9 cubic feet behind the third row, 57.5 behind the second and 103.4 overall. And that’s just the regular-length version; the Navigator L sees those numbers climb to a cavernous 36.0/79.6/120.3 cubic feet.\n\nContent Differences?\n\nAside from the engine, what else differs between the GLS450 and GLS580 that could justify a $22,000 difference in base prices? Honestly, not much. There’s some additional standard equipment on the GLS580, such as heated and ventilated multicontour massaging front seats (you have to pay extra to get the ventilation and massage on the GLS450). The 580 gets five-zone automatic climate control (the 450 can have four-zone), illuminated running boards and soft-close doors standard. Visually, the two differ only slightly: standard wheels on the GLS450 are 19 inches, while the 580 gets 21-inchers. There are also some option packages you can get only on the 580, such as a Night Package that brings blacked-out trim, and an AMG Line Package. Both give the GLS different trim, bumpers, grilles, etc. You can go up to 21-inch wheels on the 450, but the 580 lets you specify some massive 23-inch wheels and tires as options.\n\nThe base GLS450 comes so well-equipped that aside from the bigger, more powerful engine and a little bit of extra equipment, there isn’t much to justify the additional cost to upgrade to a GLS580. It seems the main reason to go for the more expensive version is simply the prestige of having the bigger number on the tailgate. Until the new ultra-lux 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS arrives sometime this year, the 580 will occupy the top spot in the lineup. But unless you absolutely must have that number on your tailgate, save yourself a pile of cash and go for the just-as-good GLS450, then option it up with a lot of the stuff you’d have to pay for on the 580 anyway, like the Executive Rear Seat Package, the E-Active Body Control suspension (an absolute must) and the Driver Assistance Package.\n\nThe GLS has a more versatile interior than a BMW X7 and much more technology than a Lincoln Navigator. (Compare the GLS to its competitors here.) The new 2021 Cadillac Escalade is out but we haven’t driven it yet; its new digital dash and fine leather interior may give the GLS a run for its money, and its size rivals the Navigator. But until we get some time behind the wheel of that monster, the GLS remains our pick for the best three-row luxury SUV for the money.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class: That’s Your Big Boy\n2019 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class: 8 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\n2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class Is Formidable Foe to BMW X7\n2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS Priced to Give BMW X7 a Run for Its Money\n2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE580 Brings Mild-Hybrid V-8 to GLE-Class\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a full-size SUV that can seat up to seven people in three rows. It’s powered by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine (450) or 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (580). The ultraluxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. GLS competitors include the BMW X7, Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nAfter a 2024 refresh, the GLS mostly stands pat for 2025. All trims now come with a biometric fingerprint sensor, and several special-order Manufaktur paint colors and trim choices are newly available. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo system\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\n360-degree camera system \n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo system\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all of their luggage from Point A to Point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display that takes a lot of practice to learn. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling nature, there are few things to nitpick in Mercedes’ largest SUV.",

      "expert_review": "As of this moment in 2019, if you want a three-row, seven-seat luxury SUV, you’re going to have to spend a good deal of money. Your options are the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class or the Land Rover Range Rover if you want something European, the Cadillac Escalade or Lincoln Navigator if you’re OK with something American, or if you swing Japanese, there’s the Lexus LX 570 or Infiniti QX80. Soon a new BMW will join the fray, the X7, and new, smaller crossover-style SUVs are coming from Lincoln and Cadillac — but for now, them’s your choices, as they say.\n\nOf the six currently on the market, the Mercedes-Benz is one of the fresher ones, having seen its last facelift in 2016 (the Range Rover last saw an update in 2012), but it was just a mild refresh; it still uses a lot of older Mercedes-Benz systems and components. Does its age versus newer entries like the Lincoln Navigator put it at a disadvantage?\n\nOld-School Style\n\nThe GLS’ styling reflects the old-school look of Mercedes-Benz: more distinctive and upright than the swoopier styling seen on the brand’s latest endeavors. The benefit of that upright styling is plentiful interior headroom and cargo space, but the look is starting to age — and it’s likely to look even more out of date when parked next to the new 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE mid-size SUV, which will start gracing showrooms this year. The pressure is on from the competition, too, with the new Lincoln Navigator providing some interesting options for buyers and the Cadillac Escalade about to get a big refresh later this year. Given the GLS is one of the few remaining vehicles in the Mercedes showroom that hasn’t seen a major update in a while, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a fresh model in the very near future.\n\nRolling Relaxation\n\nThere are several flavors of GLS-Class. My test vehicle was the entry-level GLS450, powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine. It makes 362 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, and it’s mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that powers a permanent all-wheel-drive system. While this sounds like a healthy level of power and torque, it doesn’t feel like it; acceleration is relaxed at best, with an emphasis more on smoothness than spirit. The transmission doesn’t shift terribly quickly, and the overall experience comes across as unhurried and refined rather than sporting.\n\nUpgrade to the GLS550 and you’ll get a twin-turbocharged 4.7-liter V-8 pumping out 449 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque, or you can go all out and get the hairy-chested Mercedes-AMG GLS63, which is equipped with a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 making 577 hp and 561 pounds-feet of torque. The three powertrain possibilities (each separated by a price jump of roughly $25,000-$30,000) mean there are options to suit everyone’s power needs — provided you have the cash.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 is perfectly adequate for around-town use, highway cruising and people hauling. Upgrading to the larger engines doesn’t appreciably affect tow ratings; the GLS450 and GLS550 are both rated to tow 7,200 pounds, while the GLS63 gets a slight bump, to 7,500 pounds. It’s wonderfully quiet out on the highway, with more wind noise than engine noise making its way into the well-sealed cabin.\n\nThe GLS450 handles like a big SUV: a bit floaty, a bit vague in the steering and somewhat top-heavy when changing directions. It doesn’t have the active suspension that’s newly optional on the high-tech GLE, but it wouldn’t surprise me if the next one offers it. It feels heavy because it is heavy: The GLS450 is more than 5,300 pounds, and more powerful models are even portlier. It’s lighter than the hulking American behemoths (despite the Navigator’s aluminum body) but more than 300 pounds heavier than a Range Rover. Again, though, the whole idea here is that you’re not driving this thing aggressively anyway, so why not make it a sedate experience all-around? It’s cushy, comfy and rather slow. Mission accomplished.\n\nFuel economy isn’t great, but it is above average for the class. The twin-turbo V-6 with the nine-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive nets the GLS an EPA rating of 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. My results were a better than expected 20.2 mpg in a week’s worth of city and highway driving. That’s slightly better than the V-8-powered AWD Escalade’s estimated 14/21/17 mpg and about even with the larger, twin-turbo V-6-powered Navigator’s 16/21/18 mpg with all-wheel drive, both of which owe their numbers to their 10-speed automatic transmissions. All of them shame the Lexus LX 570 with its V-8, eight-speed automatic transmission and paltry 13/18/15 mpg rating.\n\nClassy But Dated Inside\n\nWhat makes you not mind the fact that the GLS450 isn’t all that entertaining to drive are its interior accommodations. Yes, the interior is at least a decade old in terms of buttons, switches, climate controls and more, but despite its visibly aged style, it’s still extremely nice in there. Top-quality materials abound, with real leather, real metal trim and beautiful wood adorning everything. It even smells like luxury inside thanks to the quality leather.\n\nMy test vehicle included the $6,000 Grand Edition Package, which brings Designo Porcelain and Espresso Brown real Nappa leather with special stitching, light natural-grain striped wood trim and special badging. Seated amid this much comfortable leather, nestled in spacious, supportive, adaptive multicontour thrones with massage functions, you can overlook the fact that it looks like the climate-control knobs skipped an upgrade the rest of the lineup got.\n\nVisibility is excellent thanks to tall windows and an upright seating position. This genuinely feels like a proper SUV, not a car-based crossover and the compromised space that entails.\n\nBackseat Deficit\n\nUnfortunately, the front seats’ spaciousness does not extend to the rows behind them. Second-row legroom is compromised; it doesn’t feel nearly as spacious as the smaller GLE crossover SUV’s backseat — and it’s not, with 38.5 inches of legroom versus the 2020 GLE’s maximum of 41.1 inches with its optional adjustable second row. There’s plenty of width and headroom despite the seats sitting higher than the first row, stadium-style, but your knees are more likely than not to contact the first-row seatbacks. That’s unexpected in such a large SUV but not that uncommon in old-style ones, most of which were built on rear-wheel-drive truck platforms. According to the spec sheet, the GLS has the least first- and second-row legroom of its competitors. The third row is decent but still best suited for small adults, children or very brief trips — you won’t want to spend any time back there if you can avoid it. Getting in and out of it isn’t as easy as in some competitors, as the actuation of the second row’s tilt-and-fold function is manual, not powered, folding via a pull cord and handle behind the second row.\n\nA rig this big should have some decent cargo-carrying ability, and it does. With the third row up, the GLS has 16.0 cubic feet of cargo room. That’s a bit more than the Escalade’s 15.2 cubic feet and the Lexus LX 570’s 9.1 cubic feet, but less than the big Navigator’s 20.9 cubic feet. Fold the third-row seatbacks (which do not fold flat in the GLS) and it expands to 49.4 cubic feet, better than the LX 570’s 44.7 cubic feet but short of the larger Cadillac and Navigator. Fold the second- and third-row seats, and your maximum cargo volume is 93.8 cubic feet, just a tick below the Escalade’s 94.2 cubic feet but well ahead of the LX 570’s 83.1. The Navigator dwarfs them all with a maximum of 103.4 cubic feet — and we should note that both the Escalade and Navigator are available in longer versions, expanding both models to a maximum volume of about 120 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. As is common practice with most Mercedes-Benz vehicles, a minimal number of safety systems are standard, with significantly more available for an extra fee. The base model gets little beyond an attention assist (which sends an alert if the driver becomes drowsy) and active braking assist. Forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and automatic cruise control come with the $2,250 Driver Assistance Package. That package also nets you lane keep assist, blind spot warning and more. An active parking assist package is optional, complete with surround-view cameras. Of the various competitors, only Lexus makes a lot of its advanced safety systems standard.\n\nLuxury Prices\n\nThe new 2019 GLS450 starts at $71,145 including destination and such niceties as a standard moonroof, dual-zone climate control, heated seats, a power liftgate and rain-sensing wipers. My test vehicle was a Grand Edition, which includes that $6,000 package with ambient lighting, a unique wood and leather interior, active LED headlights, 20-inch wheels and special badging. It also had a $5,800 Bang & Olufsen premium audio system, Mercedes’ Premium Package (with navigation, keyless entry, lane keep assist, a power passenger seat, blind spot assist), Distronic automatic cruise control, multicontour massaging front seats, heated and cooled cupholders and so much more, all for a hefty grand total of $99,620.\n\nAs much money as that sounds like, it’s not out of line for the class. Both the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade start in the same ballpark, and their loaded versions also top $100,000. Both models have more room inside than the Mercedes, and their optional extended models offer a lot more room. While the Cadillac is an aging model due for a big redo this year, the Navigator is updated and has morphed into a fully competitive, stylish alternative to the Benz. The Lexus LX 570 is also up there in years, and it starts at a much higher price of more than $90,000 — but that’s the only way it comes, and it’s loaded. Compare all four here.\n\nWe’ll probably see a new GLS in the very near future, but until then, the big Benz remains a solid choice, providing a relaxed driving experience, a comfortable and luxurious environment and useful cargo space for families.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
