      "expert_review": "Is the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 a Good Performance SUV? \n\nMost certainly yes, but while its new, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder hybrid powertrain is a clear step up in power and performance, it’s a step backward in personality. For some, though, the gains in both efficiency and capability will be worth the trade-off.\n\nHow Does the Mercedes-AMG GLC63 Compare With Other SUVs? \n\nHot stuff like the BMW X3 M Competition and Porsche Macan GTS don’t even come close; the GLC63 S E Performance’s bonkers power puts it into a different league, closer in capability to class-up stuff like the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Audi RS Q8.\n\nRumor has it the V-8’s headed back to Benz. Whether due to lack of customer demand, internal distaste or a heady combination of both, a number of public comments from brand execs hint that the current (and very new) generation of hybridized, turbocharged four-cylinders found in a selection of Mercedes-AMG’s “63” products hasn’t garnered the public response the brand expected.\n\nIt’s absolutely been confirmed that AMG is working on a new V-8 powertrain, but what’s not confirmed is where that new heart will land; we’ve yet to see what the next-gen E63 sedan/wagon and CLE63 coupe have under their hoods, but mules of both vehicles caught testing on the Nurburgring blanketed the surrounding greenery with a distinctly octo-tastic soundtrack.\n\nRelated: How Much Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC?\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 E Performance, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nExciting, but we now need to temper expectations for the current GLC63. I’m of two minds here: I think the hybrid four-cylinder drivetrain wasn’t the correct move for a vehicle whose identity is so inexorably intertwined with the V-8 engine, but I also wouldn’t expect Mercedes to completely ditch such an extensively engineered and highly complex drivetrain within its first two model years.\n\nIs Mercedes-Benz Bringing the V-8 Back?\n\nThat said, it wouldn’t be the first time an automaker had abandoned a primo engineering project after lackluster response. Still, it makes more hierarchical sense for Mercedes to leave the four-cylinder be and try to make up lost sales ground with those eight-cylinder Es and CLEs. So for now, I’m approaching the GLC63 S E Performance and the similarly powered C63 S E Performance sedan as vehicles set for sustained production —  at least the next two model years.\n\nThe GLC63’s story is much the same as its sedan counterpart’s. Long gone is the 503-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 of the last generation; it now buzzes around with that hybridized turbo-four. Without all the electrification hardware, the boosted four-banger zips out a mighty 469 hp and 402 pounds-feet of torque, making it far and away the most powerful production four-cylinder ever made. Factor in the electric motor linked up toward the rear of the drivetrain, and you add a soupy 201 hp and 236 pounds-feet into the mix, with two additional motors handling turbo spool-up and starter/alternator duties.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 E Performance, engine | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAll in, that’s 671 hp and a stonkin’ 752 pounds-feet of torque to command via a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel-drive system. Mercedes says the GLC63’s 0-60 mph sprint is dispatched in a shocking 3.5 seconds — just 0.2 seconds behind the C63 S E Performance. Given the Germans are renowned for sandbagging their official acceleration figures, you can look for the real 0-60 scoot to fall somewhere toward 3 seconds flat.\n\nHow Quick Is the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63?\n\nThat’s quick. Quick quick. I know this era of proliferated, over-torqued electric sledges has us dissociating when it comes to specs-sheet performance figures, but this crossover has the guts to pull on supercars from the mid-2010s — while hauling your mom, a kid or two, some boxes, a whole heap of groceries and an iced matcha in the center console.\n\nIn theory, this is the ultimate do-everything vehicle for families in search of some sizzle in their sled; Mercedes finery, AMG performance, decent fuel economy — I averaged 16.2 mpg over 251 aggressive miles, but it’s EPA-rated 20 mpg combined — and crossover utility. And I think the average GLC63 customer will care far, far less about what’s under the hood than the average C63 buyer.\n\nIn practice, this Mercedes can be aggro where you want it soft, muted when you want a knifepoint. Unless you’re planning some trackwork — insane thought process — please skip the very aesthetically cool (and effective) AMG Performance seats for the standard thrones. My test car had the former, and as much as my inner speed freak loved the pass-through elements and ultra-squeezy bolsters, they’re complete overkill for something you’ll be driving every day, even with 671 hp on tap.\n\nHere’s another interesting contradiction: Though this vehicle is monstrously quick from a dig, acceleration feels as though it drops off after the upper-limit of American highway speeds. It’s still quick, but I’m not sure that electrical assistance is sustained through the speedo. Still, engaging the GLC’s launch control at a city stoplight is one hell of a way to spill drinks, lose phones and cause general mayhem when you catch a car full of folks unawares.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 Drive in the City?\n\nMy week with this nuclear GLC was a busy one, devoid of any chance to hit the California canyons; hosting a houseguest meant the GLC served more as a supercruiser than a mountain meteor. I didn’t really get to test out the full range of the adaptive suspension, nor could I reap the benefits of its trick rear-wheel steering outside of low-speed maneuvering in tight parking lots.\n\nIn all modes save Race, the GLC requisitely shifted the balance of performance and comfort to a usable degree. Race was a bridge — or maybe a pit lane — too far toward violence. In that mode, the suspension was too stiff for urban Los Angeles roads and the powertrain too pointed for traffic.\n\nUh, duh. If you get the standard seats and oscillate between Comfort and Sport Plus modes, the GLC63 S E Performance approaches Goldilocks levels of well-roundedness. You’re not even locked into clinical, cold solitary confinement with carbon fiber, Alcantara and aluminum; there’s a breadth of traditional Mercedes leather colors and wood trim to pick from, resulting in some rather classy configurations.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 E Performance, steering wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAs was the case with the far more mundane GLC350e I reviewed late last year, the cabin of Merc’s compact SUV is generally a primo place to count down the highway miles. The portrait-style 11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen is remarkably high fidelity, as is the 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and I promise your Spotify seshes will sound fabulous through the optional Burmester premium stereo.\n\nI end this evaluation torn. Despite the extra bulk and near complete lack of underhood character, I think the hybrid-four powertrain works better in this SUV than it does in the C-Class. Those buying an AMG-ified compact luxury SUV don’t strike me as the, ah, discerning type, so the downsizing under the hood will likely go unnoticed for what I assume to be a fair number of lease-and-release transactions.\n\nIf only I could get another crack at the C63…\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG C63 E Performance, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n2025 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance\n\nWell, well, well. A month or so after driving the GLC63, I got my second bout of seat-time in what must be Mercedes’ most controversial car since the first-generation A-Class. I already have a full write-up on the C63, produced after our first drive of the car, so this was more of a check-in to see how that mighty 2.0T powertrain operates in the real world, not just the twisty back roads of Malibu.\n\nThis time, I pointed the C63 toward the high-horsepower playground that is the Mojave Desert. I had a date with Ram and its updated heavy-duty pickup lineup in Laughlin, Nev., and a couple hundred miles of desolate desert tarmac stretched between my LA apartment and my casino hotel room. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for any travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nIf the GLC63 S E Performance is potent, the C63 is white hot. The prior 503-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 was great at settling down when its athleticism wasn’t needed, but the new four-cylinder hybridized powertrain is a step beyond it in civility. The four-banger faded into the background when puttering through the inexorable traffic clogs that always prevent me from leaving LA’s gravitational pull.\n\nIs the Mercedes-AMG C63 Fast?\n\nThen, the open wasteland. Full-throttle in the hybrid C63 is a sensation you won’t find anywhere else in the compact sedan class, squeezing your eyes and squishing your gut not unlike a Porsche 911 Turbo from two generations ago — and that’s a compliment. Passing power is immense, to put it lightly; I won’t go into full, incriminating detail of what happens when you play “floor it until it gets scary” in this car, but, uh, dang.\n\nThe brakes are strong, too — very strong. My time with the car was mainly focused on long dusty straights rather than mountain passes, so refer to the first drive for the full back-roads blast. Ride composure over some of the more granular Nevada roads was well isolated and managed, with the same general level of comfort available in the C as in the GLC.\n\nA fast, tremendously capable and multifaceted supersedan, no doubt. But are its clear day-to-day operational gains worth the undeniable loss of character? Not for me — and apparently, not for customers.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition Stands Out, Subtly\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE300 Coupe a Good Car? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\n2026 Mercedes-Maybach SL680 Monogram Series Ditches Backseat, Pours on the Chrome\nShop for a 2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 Near You\nShop for a 2025 Mercedes-AMG C63 Near You\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was updated Sept. 30, 2020, to add our driving impressions on the AMG GLC43 Coupe.\n\nThe verdict: Stylish, luxurious and blisteringly fast in AMG form, the compact GLC-Class crossover is the C-Class sedan for people who need more cargo space.\n\nVersus the competition: The GLC-Class easily compares in size, technology, luxury and price to the BMW X3, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q5 and a host of other premium-brand crossovers.\n\nYou don’t need me to tell you that SUVs are selling like crazy right now. You’re probably thinking of buying one yourself, and maybe you’re thinking of buying this one: the updated 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC300: Don’t Judge This Benz by Its Cover\n\nIf so, you’re not alone. The GLC-Class has surpassed the C-Class compact sedan to become Mercedes-Benz’s best-selling model in the U.S., and for good reason: For a few bucks more than a C-Class, you get more space and headroom, plus the same quality interior, top-notch amenities, modern multimedia system and loads of available extra-cost safety equipment. For 2020, Mercedes-Benz has updated the GLC’s styling, powertrains and some interior bits to keep its most popular model on top in a competitive class.\n\nAfter spending some time in a standard GLC300 as well as the racy AMG GLC43 and GLC63 pair, we’ve come to appreciate the idea of having one as an alternative to a standard C-Class sedan.\n\nThe Best Seller: 2020 GLC300\n\nThe base model sold in the U.S. is the GLC300, equipped with a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and nine-speed automatic transmission. It can have rear- or all-wheel drive and makes 14 more hp than the outgoing model, though torque is unchanged at a stout 273 pounds-feet. It’s smooth and punchy, but suffers a bit of lag on initial acceleration.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s the transmission tuning or actual engine turbo lag, but there’s a noticeable hesitation between the movement of your right foot and the car’s acceleration response. Switching the drive mode into one of its sportier settings (Sport and Sport Plus are available) doesn’t seem to help much, though it does change transmission behavior, keeping it in a lower gear. The lag doesn’t negatively impact the overall feel of the GLC300, which is tuned more for comfort than sport anyway, but it’s noticeable when you call for quick acceleration.\n\nFuel economy for the base engine is decent, coming in at an EPA-estimated 22/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the rear-wheel-drive base model, 21/28/24 mpg with 4Matic all-wheel drive.\n\nComfort is more the GLC300’s game. While it’s a bit tight inside due to it being a compact SUV, it’s a comfortable cabin with highly adjustable seats, decent legroom and plenty of headroom for front occupants. Storage up front is limited; there aren’t a lot of places to put your stuff except the cupholders. (Just hope you didn’t need to put a cup there.) Backseat passengers are a bit more cramped, but the space is comparable to competitors such as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Jaguar F-Pace.\n\nWhat you’ll notice most about the GLC is how quiet it is: The engine itself is impressively muted; there’s absolutely no wind noise even at highway speeds; and road noise through the tires is hushed. It’s an astonishingly serene driving experience for a compact crossover. The steering is heavily boosted, especially at lower speeds, but stable and well controlled, especially as speeds start to climb.\n\nThe only issue I have with the GLC300’s drive is the ride quality, which is surprisingly stiff. I blame my test vehicle’s 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires; while the wheels served to spice up the look of the GLC quite nicely and offered plenty of grip, the short-sidewall tires definitely transmitted a lot of New Jersey’s broken pavement harshness to the cabin, where the SUV’s copious levels of sound and body insulation couldn’t quite filter out the worst of the bumps. The standard 18-inch wheels may not be as sexy, but if you live anywhere with changing seasons and their resulting road-surface conditions, you’ll appreciate the taller-sidewall tires’ ability to soak up bumps a lot more than the bigger wheels’ looks.\n\nRefined Technology\n\nThe GLC’s interior updates are minor but welcome. The biggest change is the introduction of MBUX, Mercedes-Benz’s next-generation touchscreen-based multimedia system that provides a streamlined user interface and some really slick features not seen from any other automakers.\n\nYes, you could plug in your personal electronics and use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — but if you do, you’ll miss out on the navigation system’s eye-popping augmented reality turn-by-turn directional arrows. A forward-facing camera shows you the view ahead, and upon approaching a turn a magic arrow appears, floating on the screen. The only way this would be cooler is if it were projected onto the windshield itself.\n\nThe only drawback to having the MBUX system is that you can’t say the word “Mercedes” in the car without activating the Siri/Alexa-style voice concierge, interrupting your music or conversation and forcing you to grumble “Cancel!” at the car.  Most annoying. When you intend to trigger the voice-control function (by saying “Hey Mercedes”), the voice controls of the MBUX system work reasonably well. That said, accessing your personal music on your smartphone is not exactly trouble-free.\n\nThe GLC has a new steering wheel, and while that’s not usually something worthy of mention, this one includes Mercedes-Benz’s touch-sensitive five-way controllers on each spoke. They work as well here as they do in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles — which is to say, poorly. Having touch-sensitive controls on a steering wheel is a ridiculous idea; it means having to focus on avoiding touching the wheel in certain places and occasionally changing a setting or channel or switching songs when you don’t intend to. Then, when you do intend to use the controls, it’s easy to scroll past the thing you’re trying to select. I’m not sure why they went from dedicated five-way rocker switches to touch-sensitive buttons, but it was definitely a step backward for user-friendliness.\n\nThe only other major development for the 2020 GLC is newly available driver-safety technology in the form of Active Distance Assist Distronic and Active Steering Assist. These bring some of the semi-autonomous driving functions of other Mercedes-Benz models to the GLC, allowing for hands-free driving for limited periods, automatic lane changes using just the turn signal, and automatic slowing of a vehicle in cruise control when approaching a bend or junction in the road. It works as well as it does in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles: You can’t have your hands off the wheel for too long or the car yells at you and will eventually deactivate the system. It’s marketed as a steering-assist feature, not a true hands-off solution like GM’s Super Cruise or BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant, but it does indeed alleviate the burden of tedious driving along straight, boring highways or in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n\nThe Spicy Alternative: 2020 AMG GLC63\n\nThe maniacs over at Mercedes’ AMG division applied their touch to the GLC (as they have to seemingly everything in the Mercedes showroom these days), crafting the Mercedes-AMG GLC63. It’s equipped with a hand-built, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 making 469 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque. Alternatively, you can opt for a GLC63 S, which ups those numbers to 503 hp and 516 pounds-feet. All-wheel drive is standard, and the nine-speed automatic gets special tuning to handle all that torque. The EPA fuel-economy estimate drops to 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined with the big engine.\n\nExternally, the GLC63 gets considerably different styling, with a vertical-strake grille, wider fenders and bumpers, integrated trapezoidal tailpipes, and new LED light patterns for the headlights and taillights.\n\nThe driving experience is worlds different from the lesser GLC300, showing you just what an electronically adjustable air suspension and massive turbocharged V-8 can do. The whole package is a bit nuts for a compact SUV, but that’s kind of the point of the GLC63. It’s never going to see a racetrack — nobody would take an SUV out for a club track-day event — but out on the street, the combination of much more aggressive, fat-fendered styling and the brawny V-8 and its instant torque is crazy fun.\n\nThe Medium Heat: 2020 AMG GLC43\n\nAs its nomenclature suggests, the GLC43 is an AMG-lite version with an in-between engine: a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 385 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque. Like the GLC300, it has notable accelerator lag, both from a standing start and accelerating while already in motion — the latter due more to its nine-speed automatic transmission, a stubborn actor for downshifts. Once all systems are go, the GLC43 accelerates swiftly, especially as revs climb. But the whole of it gives a sort of binary sensation of power: It’s either on or off, and not always on your preferred timing.\n\nLike in the GLC300, shock absorption remained firm in our GLC43, which rode 21-inch wheels and the sort of low-profile tires required with gargantuan wheels on a compact SUV. (Adaptive shock absorbers are standard across the line; AMG models trade coil springs for air springs.) Still, the GLC43 felt more hunkered down than the GLC300, with better body control and less bounciness than its non-AMG sibling sometimes exhibited.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPowered-Up Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe, SUV Join 2020 GLC Squad\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 SUV Gets Light Exterior Updates, Modern Tech\nHey, Mercedes! Voice-Activated Assistant Drives New MBUX System\nResearch the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC300\nResearch the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC63\nThe Weird Ones: 2020 GLC Coupe\n\nWant all the high-riding style of a crossover SUV but none of its headroom or cargo utility? Well, Mercedes-Benz has the answer: a coupe version of the GLC that’s meant to go head-to-head with the BMW X4. GLC Coupes feature a chopped-top look and swoopy hatchback, and they’re available in GLC300, AMG 43, AMG 63 and AMG 63 S versions. They behave exactly like the SUV version of the GLC, with the same powertrains, suspensions, and ride and handling characteristics. The biggest difference in how they feel stems from the loss of the GLC SUV’s excellent all-around visibility: The new gun-slit rear window doesn’t even have a wiper, meaning your already dramatically curtailed rear view will get even worse in the rain.\n\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 Coupe | Manufacturer images\n\nThe only reason to choose a GLC Coupe over the standard SUV is style — and that’s of questionable taste, given choosing a coupe comes with the stigma of anyone conversant in automobiles recognizing you’ve spent a lot of money on something silly. Our advice: Stick with the already stylish SUV version. If you must have something more stylish, pop your extra cash into an AMG version, which provides both extra style and a lot more entertainment value.\n\nGLC-Class Pricing: Luxury and Speed Never Come Cheap\n\nStarting price for a rear-wheel-drive 2020 GLC300 is $43,495 (prices include destination fee). That price bumps up to $45,495 if you want 4Matic all-wheel drive or $50,995 if you want a GLC300 Coupe. Start adding safety features and fancy interior bits, such as the stellar head-up display, and that number quickly climbs. The as-tested price for my loaded GLC300 4Matic came to an eye-popping $63,835. That’s just past the starting price of the cheapest AMG version, the AMG GLC43 ($60,495). The GLC63, meanwhile, starts at $74,745 for a GLC63 or $85,095 for a GLC63 S Coupe. Load up a GLC63 S Coupe and you’ll come perilously close to the $100,000 mark. That’s a lot of money for a compact SUV.\n\nThere’s also a plug-in hybrid, the GLC350e, which comes only in SUV form (that is to say, not as a GLC Coupe). With 22 miles of EPA-rated electric range, the GLC350e starts at $52,895 for 2020. But Mercedes is, er, pulling the plug on the GLC350e after the 2020 model year. Interested shoppers should get one while they can — or go all-electric in the forthcoming EQC400.\n\nDespite its formidable price, this is still Mercedes-Benz’s most popular model, and for good reason. The GLC300’s combination of refinement, comfort, technology, safety, efficiency and utility is definitely a winning one. Yes, it’s expensive, but its customers don’t seem to mind, finding value in the price commensurate with the experience of owning one (or, more likely, leasing one). If you want the best GLC you can get, the AMG GLC63 is worth the extra cost, providing a highly entertaining driving experience and an opulent, technology-packed cabin.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
