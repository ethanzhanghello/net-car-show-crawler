      "expert_review": "The GLE Coupe is the less practical, more stylish twin to Mercedes-Benz’s mid-size GLE SUV, with a fastback roofline that trades rear-seat and cargo space for a dramatic profile. Prior to the 2025 model year, Mercedes-Benz was so confident that buyers of the coupe were committed to sport that it only offered the model in two AMG trims. New for 2025 is a non-AMG entry-level trim, the GLE450 4Matic; it costs around $15,000 less than the AMG GLE53 and starts at $77,550 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S Coupe: Will It Track? Should It Track?\n\nWhile the GLE450 doesn’t have an AMG engine beneath its hood, it does sport a standard AMG exterior styling package and 20-inch AMG wheels. Numerous new paint and upholstery options for all three trim levels ensure that buyers can spec their GLE Coupe exactly how they want.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nGLE450 4Matic: $77,550\nAMG GLE53: $93,300\nAMG GLE63 S: $133,300\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe new GLE450 4Matic might be the new entry-level variant, but it is far from basic. It squats on adaptive dampers and 20-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 64-color ambient lighting and a power tilt/telescoping steering column. Standard tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nIn addition to its base composition, the GLE450 is available in two trim packages. The $1,300 Exclusive Trim Package includes ventilated front seats and a 13-speaker Burmester sound system. To that, the Pinnacle Trim adds upgraded LED headlights, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, a fragrance diffuser, a head-up display, heated and cooled front cupholders, gesture controls and animated Mercedes-logo puddle lamps for $5,300.\n\nDespite the $50,000-plus window in their base prices, every 2025 GLE Coupe includes the same standard driver-assistance technologies. The suite includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver attention monitor, a 360-degree parking camera, automated parking and automatic high beams.\n\nThe AMG GLE53 rides on 21-inch wheels and a sport suspension with air springs and adaptive dampers; it also gets upgraded brakes and headlights, a performance exhaust, augmented-reality navigation and the contents of the Exclusive Trim Package. Here, the Pinnacle Trim Package costs just $3,300 since some of its content is already standard.\n\nThere are no trim packages available on the AMG GLE63 S, as all of the Pinnacle equipment is standard. Also included are 22-inch wheels, larger brakes, active anti-roll bars, an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential, dynamic engine mounts, heated windshield washers, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is optional on all three variants and costs $1,950. It bundles adaptive cruise control, emergency steering assist, front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, lane-centering steering, lane change assist, traffic jam assist and road-sign recognition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 Review: Solitude Over Sportiness\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nIs the Mercedes-AMG GLE53 a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like and 3 We Don’t\nResearch Mercedes-Benz\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe GLE450 4Matic is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine with 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. A turbo 3.0-liter inline-six also powers the AMG GLE53, but it generates 429 hp and 413 pounds-feet, which Mercedes claims is good for a 4.9-second sprint from 0-60 mph, an improvement of 0.4 second over the GLE450 4Matic. At the top of the GLE Coupe food chain is the AMG GLE63 S. It boasts a 603-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 627 pounds-feet of torque and rockets to 60 mph in a claimed 3.7 seconds.\n\nAll three engines are paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard 4Matic all-wheel drive. The AMGs get the upgraded 4Matic+, which is capable of quicker torque delivery to the front and rear wheels and can send up to 100% of the power to the rear axle.\n\nThe 2025 GLE450 returns an EPA-rated 19/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The AMG GLE53 is rated at 18/22/20 mpg and the AMG GLE63 at 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is a mid-size luxury SUV that seats up to five people and is available in traditional SUV or four-door coupe form. It comes standard with a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, as well as performance-oriented AMG variants making as much as 577 hp. Competitors include the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q7 and BMW X5.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThere are no significant changes. A redesigned GLE-Class is slated to debut as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe GLE-Class comes standard with technology features like remote start and 4G LTE Wi-Fi internet connectivity. Performance-minded shoppers have two grades to consider: the 385-hp AMG GLE 43 or the AMG GLE 63, which makes 550 hp (577 hp in S guise).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe four-door coupe body style is a twist on the traditional SUV look, but the design compromises visibility, backseat access and cargo space in the name of style. With a redesigned 2020 GLE-Class on the way, there's a chance there may be deals on the 2019 version.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE delivers the power and luxury you expect from a vehicle sporting the three-pointed star emblem. Available in traditional SUV or Coupe format, the latter features a truncated tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design. The standard engine is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder, which is fitted to the front- or all-wheel-drive GLE350; a 362-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, and a 504-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. Both the 450 and 580 are equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems and come standard with AWD. But wait, there are also two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and 603-hp AMG GLE63S. With so many permutations, the GLE’s competition is varied and includes the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe 2023 GLE gets new metallic paint colors but is otherwise unchanged. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nMBUX voice recognition\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHands-free power liftgate\nHands-free park assist\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nBlind spot warning system\nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin air fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests \nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad sign recognition\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options. Even in its base format, though, the GLE is elegantly appointed, and the 255-hp turbo four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. When venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, of course: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The AMG GLE63 S delivers the motion-blurring acceleration and luxurious interior you’d expect from a $100,000-plus luxury performance SUV, leaving buyers feeling like they got their money’s worth. \n\nVersus the competition: For all its opulence and slick technology, the AMG GLE63 S is perhaps most defined by its boisterous exhaust — more barroom brawl than ballroom gala. \n\nIf the idea of a 600-horsepower luxury SUV that can give you a relaxing, heated back massage while channeling the sound of a top-fuel dragster appeals to you, you’re in the right place. The 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S is a posh people hauler with a heaping dose of raunchiness thanks to a twin-turbocharged V-8 making 603 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque. The engine helps the SUV go from 0-60 mph in a claimed 3.7 seconds, topping out at an electronically limited 174 mph. \n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S and GLS63: Big, Blingy Speed \n\nThe full range of Mercedes’ GLE mid-size SUV (an SUV version of the mid-size E-Class sedan) consists of the GLE350, 450, 580, AMG 53 and the hot rod I tested, the AMG 63 S. That’s a lot of alphanumeric soup to swallow, so just know that the AMG GLE63 S sits atop the GLE lineup in price and performance (along with character count).\n\nThe Go\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe AMG 63’s V-8 uses a pair of turbochargers atop the engine, nestled between the cylinder banks, to huff horsepower into four liters of engine displacement. The 2021’s predecessor used a 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 to make 577 hp; for 2021, the smaller 4.0-liter’s turbos aren’t the only boost driving the GLE AMG 63 S to sports-car-like acceleration. Assisting the engine’s 603 hp is a 48-volt mild-hybrid system Mercedes calls EQ Boost. It uses an electric motor between the engine and transmission to temporarily jolt up to 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque through the drivetrain. EQ Boost operates within the rated power of the gas engine, versus boosting the claimed maximum output numbers, and fills output gaps of the gas engine — most notably at launch, before the turbochargers reach their maximum charge pressure, though it can also assist during passing. \n\nAs at home as the AMG GLE63 S looks in the carpool lane — it doesn’t sport any crazy wild body flares or scoops — this ultra-high-performance SUV wouldn’t be out of place in a drag-strip staging lane. The GLE63 S has the gut-wrenching acceleration of a limited-use sports car, but with all-wheel drive, generous room for five people and heaps of cargo space compared with most things that move this quickly. Punch it from a standstill and the AMG GLE63 rears up, accelerating hard with no sign of things falling off at the top end. The Mercedes-claimed 0-60-mph time of 3.7 seconds is a few tenths quicker than the Mercedes-AMG GT coupe’s 3.9 seconds and a half-second faster than the SUV’s 2019 counterpart, which was rated at 4.2 seconds.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe AMG GLE63’s attitude is defined by its exhaust, which has an angry, snarling and totally unsuspecting aggression blasting from the pipes of this modestly styled mid-size SUV. The adjustable-volume exhaust mechanically varies its punch (there’s no electronic cabin augmentation) via drive modes, or through a selectable configuration you can bring up using electronically programmable steering-wheel-mounted buttons — which are among the most innovative drive mode selectors out there (SUV or otherwise). The sound this thing makes is in stark contrast to the Tesla Model X EV, which beats the GLE’s acceleration (Tesla says the Model X Performance takes just 2.6 seconds to get to 60 mph) with only a whisper of whine from its all-electric powertrain — nothing like the voluminous bass that comes from the AMG.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nI favor the Tesla for its directness; there’s no traditional stepped multigear transmission, but rather a single gear and loads of torque that reacts instantly to accelerator inputs with no delay or balkiness between shifts because there are no shifts. The GLE63 S’ ornery nine-speed automatic transmission is a sore mark on the car, sometimes lazily dumping upshifts in automatic or manual modes. Manual gear changes via steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters have neither the responsiveness of the dual-clutch transmission in Mercedes’ top sports car nor the directness of the excellent eight-speed automatic in the BMW X5.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe GLE63 S I tested wore massive optional 22-inch wheels with Yokohama Advan Sport summer tires sized 285/40R22 up front and 325/35R22 in back. Despite an air spring suspension (usually touted as comfort-oriented), the AMG’s ride is taut even in the most comfortable drive mode, and the large wheels mean ride quality is busy, though acceptably so for a performance-minded car; you want road feel in your sports car? You got it here.\n\nDuring my week in the SUV, the weather began approaching temperatures in which you should question driving a car with summer tires: mornings starting in the 30s and highs in the low 50s. Those conditions, combined with the car’s standard wide summer tires, resulted in front tire chatter during low-speed maneuvers until the tires warmed up, and the back end was a little squirrelier than expected when laying down power. In these conditions, the AMG with its electronically lockable rear limited-slip differential would wag its tail on wide-open-throttle downshifts or when powering out of corners. The squirelliness was entertaining, though a tad unnerving given body control through its air springs and adaptive shock absorbers means it’s not the most hunkered down, but it was still fully respectable by most SUV’s standards.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nDriving on the edge of adhesion isn’t totally foreign to the GLE63, and there’s acceptable steering response, feedback and a feeling of connectedness that means it doesn’t seem uncontrollable. The lesson, though, is that all-season or winter tires should be top of mind for owners who drive this SUV in cool or wintry conditions — and also that a 600-hp SUV wiggling for traction at wide-open throttle is completely bonkers.\n\nThe Show\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nGiddy performance is only one part of the AMG GLE63 S. The other is the opulence in which occupants are enveloped. Much of the SUV’s luxury trimmings and technology are similar to a non-AMG GLE, which was redesigned for 2020 and elevated the SUV to new heights. One change from the regular GLE stable to the AMG is that there’s no optional third row because of the packaging differences, as the lower rear of the SUV needed to accommodate the AMG 63’s unique all-wheel-drive system.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe GLE feels so appropriately appointed, with genuine metal, leather or carbon accents, that I didn’t bat an eye at its $100,000-plus price. That’s a new take versus its predecessor, which at the end of its lifespan struggled to differentiate its interior from that of a $50,000 GLE.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFully transformative from the old SUV are the dual 12.3-inch digital screens for the instrument panel and media touchscreen. Their high-end graphics and simple menu structure are top-of-the-game, integrating the GLE’s various technologies and making them readily usable. Unlike many factory navigation systems, the GLE’s native navigation has an exclusive feature that convinced me to use it instead of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto: optional augmented reality navigation that uses a front camera feed to overlay navigation arrows and street names in the media screen. It’s truly a sight to see, especially driving in the dark, where street signs aren’t as easy to read. (Of course, another factor in using the native navigation was that my iPhone wasn’t compatible with the Mercedes’ USB-C outlets and I didn’t have an adapter on me.)\n\n2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe SUV’s high-end tech is complemented by carbon-fiber add-ons that slather the interior with racy, authentic trim on the door panels, dashboard and steering wheel. The optional steering wheel is especially sporty, with carbon trim accented by standard Dinamica suede-like microfiber and aluminum paddle shifters, but like other sueded steering wheels, I found the fabric portion a little slippery when barehanded (versus wearing a driving glove, which would be ridiculous in this family SUV); luckily, it’s only partially covered in this material.\n\nAbout That Price\n\nAn entry-level GLE350 starts around $55,000 and has little in common with the doubly priced AMG GLE63 S, which starts just below $115,000. Plus, the GLE63 S I drove had these options:\n\nAMG carbon-fiber trim: $1,750\nAMG carbon-fiber engine cover: $1,500\nAMG Performance steering wheel in carbon fiber: $400\n22-inch AMG cross-spoke forged wheels: $2,750\nRear side airbags: $700\nPanoramic sunroof: $1,000\nFour-zone automatic climate control: $860\nMBUX Interior Assistant: $200\nPre-wiring for rear seat entertainment: $170\nMagic Vision Control: $350\nMBUX Technology Package (with that trick augmented navigation system and a head-up display): $1,450\nDriver Assistance Package Plus: $1,950\nWarmth & Comfort Package: $1,050\nEnergizing Comfort Package Plus (including some of the best massaging seats I’ve ever experienced): $1,650\nAcoustic Comfort Package: $1,110\n\n\n\nEven at an as-tested price of $131,880, though, I honestly can’t put its stratospheric price in the “Cons” list; the lunacy of the whole thing just seems to justify its price.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE mid-size SUV seats five in standard form or seven with its available third row, and it’s available with a variety of powertrains and options. All GLEs come with all-wheel drive. The base GLE350 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. A 375-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, while a 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. All three powertrains are equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems. A new-for-2024 GLE450e plug-in hybrid pairs a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a 23.3-kilowatt-hour battery for a total of 381 hp and an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 48 miles. \n\nFor high-performance buyers, Mercedes offers two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and 603-hp AMG GLE63S. Both are available as a traditional SUV or in a sloped-roof coupe body style; the latter features a fastback-style tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design.\n\nWith so many permutations, the GLE’s competition is varied, including the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nIn addition to the new 450e PHEV variant, the GLE lineup gets freshened exterior styling that includes a revised front grille and bumper design, along with new wheel designs and interior details. Other updates include a new steering wheel and the latest version of the MBUX infotainment interface, which can be equipped with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHeated front seats\nPower liftgate\n360-degree camera system\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nForward collision warning with automatic braking\nBlind spot warning \nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin air fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests \nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad sign recognition\nMBUX voice recognition\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes GLE certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options, but even in its base format, it’s elegantly appointed, and the 255-hp turbo four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. Venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, though: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual.",
