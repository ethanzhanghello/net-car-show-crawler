      "expert_review": "Fast, gorgeous and more affordable than its predecessor, the new Mercedes-AMG GT S may just be the best-driving car the automaker has ever made.\n\nThe old Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG coupe was a unique sports car. Crazy fast, equipped with crowd-favorite gull-wing doors and seriously expensive, it was a limited-production machine meant for a very exclusive clientele. When it came time to replace it, Mercedes decided it would be better to go after a higher-volume segment: The high-end but more affordable sports car. Players like the Porsche 911, Audi R8, Nissan GT-R, Dodge Viper and Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 all operate in this niche, but Mercedes-Benz didn’t have a dog in that hunt.\n\nEnter the new 2016 Mercedes-AMG GT S coupe. Note that it’s not labeled a Mercedes-Benz — this is part of the company’s new branding scheme that has created two sub-brands for Mercedes-Benz: Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach. No longer a discrete ultra-luxury brand, Maybachs will be Mercedes-based cruisers aimed at Bentley and Rolls-Royce. AMGs will be serious sports machines like the one seen here: Dedicated go-fast vehicles that combine the visceral thrill of a high-powered sports car with the luxury amenities and technology-based refinement for which Mercedes-Benz is known.\n\nSo with this much less expensive GT S coupe, what has Mercedes wrought? Is it a true 911 fighter, a harder-edged SL with a fixed roof, a successor to the outrageous SLS or something new?\n\nExterior & Styling\nFrom just about any angle, the GT coupe is gorgeous. Pictures truly do not do the shape justice. This may be one of the most expressive cars Mercedes-Benz has brought to market since the 1963 230 SL “Pagoda.” The shape evokes the old Jaguar E-Type in its proportions, with a long hood, short deck and a quickly sloping roofline behind a bulbous top. It’s taut, clean and mean looking, whipping just as many heads around outside the car as inside.\n\nThere are distinct cues from other Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the GT coupe’s lines, such as taillights that look lifted from the stunning new S-Class coupe and a front end that evokes the CLA. Nobody will mistake it for anything other than a Mercedes, but it’s in no way stodgy or reminiscent of a conservative past. Parked next to a current-generation SL, it becomes obvious the GT S is the future of Mercedes-Benz styling. It’s a far more attractive design than the SL.\n\nHow It Drives\nUnder the long and shapely hood is a brand-new, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine making 503 horsepower in the GT S, where it’s attached to a lightning-fast, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The standard GT model isn’t available yet, but it will feature less horsepower, fewer standard features and a lower sticker price when it arrives in 2016.\n\nThe GT S’ combination is good enough for a 3.7-second zero-to-60-mph dash, Mercedes says, with a top speed of 196 mph. It’s a fantastic engine, docile when it needs to be, blindingly powerful when called upon. While it doesn’t have quite the visceral, sky-ripping, thunderous roar of the SLS’ old naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V-8, it still makes plenty of its own music. That’s especially true when you push the “loudener” button that opens the exhaust flaps and brings all that glorious V-8 exhaust noise into the surrounding environment.\n\nIt’s reasonable to compare this car with the Porsche 911, given their similar missions and pricing. Like the Porsche, an astonishing amount of electronic-minder technology helps you control all the GT’s power and agility. But unlike the Porsche, it provides a layer of refinement and luxury that acts as a firewall between the machine and the driver.\n\nA selector knob allows drivers to essentially dial in how thin they want that insulating blanket to be. Keep it in Comfort mode, and the GT coupe is as easy to drive as the larger, calmer SL touring roadster. Start twisting the knob toward Sport or Sport Plus, and you’ll allow more feedback through the suspension, require more effort through the steering wheel and generate faster responses from the transmission. Twist it all the way to Race mode, and the GT S turns into a track monster: Shifts become extremely quick, torque is available instantly, and the roar from the twin pipes out the back of the coupe becomes formidable.\n\nYou can also dial in various settings to create your own mix, using the configurable Individual setting. I generally preferred to keep the suspension in Comfort mode, the steering in Sport Plus, the transmission in Sport and the exhaust as loud as possible.\n\nOut in the hills and forests south of San Francisco, the AMG GT S coupe was far more sporting and stiff than an SL, as is appropriate for the vehicle’s sports car nature. Broken pavement sets up some jolts in the cabin even in the Comfort setting, but it’s not harsh or uncomfortable.\n\nOut on the swoops and dips of Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, the AMG GT S coupe showed just what it can do — and what it can do is go seriously fast. It is a wonderfully balanced car, with phenomenal amounts of grip for a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. You can rotate the car easily in turns using either throttle or steering input, and the amazing amounts of grip mean that later braking into — and earlier acceleration out of — corners is possible.\n\nInterior\nThe GT coupe is smaller than you might think, which becomes apparent when you walk up and open one of its feather-light aluminum doors. The cabin looks tight, but it’s remarkably comfortable for people of all shapes and sizes. Ingress and egress are no more difficult than in a 911 or Audi R8, and once inside the multi-adjustable seats and scalloped headliner (a glass panel roof is optional) provide plenty of position options for all body types and heights.\n\nIn the driver’s seat, in front of you is a massive, chunky wheel covered in faux suede. To the right is an extremely wide center console done up either in aluminum or piano black, depending on your trim options.\n\nThe biggest issue with the interior is visibility. The windshield is extremely short, the A-pillars are rather thick and the rearview mirror/forward camera assembly takes up too much real estate. This means the driver’s forward visibility is far more compromised than it is through a 911’s taller, upright windshield, but it’s no worse than in an R8 or Corvette, with their similarly low roofs. It becomes especially troublesome in twisty left-hand bends, as you try to position your head around the thick windshield pillar to see the road ahead.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAn array of dedicated buttons on the wide center console governs features such as engine stop-start, multimedia system volume, exhaust noise level and more. Centered is a multifunction trackpad that partially covers the traditional Mercedes rotary knob controller. The Comand multimedia system is no different from those in any other Mercedes-Benz, so it’s familiar and relatively easy to use. The screen itself is typical of Mercedes’ recent designs: an iPad-like tablet display propped up on the dash that looks like an afterthought. It doesn’t really fit with the rest of the artistry in the interior, but it functions well. It’s clear, and its high position keeps your eyes closer to the road.\n\nThe interior controls are similar to the 911’s in their execution. Several functions have dedicated buttons — instead of being accessible only through multimedia menus — making them easy to use on the fly. The 911 is a bit more obsessive with this, however, notoriously including dozens of buttons. The R8 uses the excellent Audi MMI system, which remains my benchmark for multimedia systems. The Viper’s Chrysler Uconnect system, however, isn’t far behind, with its equally clear and easy-to-use controls.\n\nCargo & Storage\nPop the liftgate, and you’re treated to a decent amount of cargo room. The GT coupe’s hatch will swallow 12.3 cubic feet of luggage; that’s enough for two (small) golf bags, according to Mercedes-Benz. A decent roll-aboard suitcase would also fit, and there are some storage pockets throughout the interior that help with smaller items.\n\nThat space is fairly generous for the segment. The Porsche 911 features just 4.8 cubic feet of room in its front trunk (frunk), but a total of 12.0 cubic feet when you account for the parcel shelf behind the front seats. The Audi R8 doesn’t have much room for bags, featuring just 3.5 cubic feet in its frunk, but the Nissan GT-R has a surprisingly deep trunk, offering 8.8 cubic feet of cargo room.\n\nSafety\nThe AMG GT S has not yet been crash-tested.\n\nLike all Mercedes-Benz products, the GT is available with a raft of electronic safety options. Being the S model, my test car had a number of them included. Items like collision prevention assist with automatic braking, front and rear parking sensors, a backup camera and a driver attention-assist monitor are standard on the GT S. The only major safety option is a lane-keeping and blind spot warning package. See all the AMG GT S’ standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe standard version of the AMG GT isn’t yet on the market and won’t be until sometime in 2016. Right now, the only version available is the more powerful, more expensive GT S model. It starts at $130,825, and its most expensive individual option is the $9,900 AMG Solarbeam Yellow paint. Spec all the options, and the sticker can rise past $158,000 — quite a bit of coin, and not far from Mercedes-AMG’s SL roadster’s top performance models, which can easily hit $150,000-$200,000.\n\nSo the question becomes: Is the GT S better to drive than a Porsche 911, a vehicle many of us consider to be the aspirational sports car benchmark? The most accurate answer would be that it’s simply different to drive from a 911, more resembling the Audi R8 in character and style. It can certainly keep up with a 911, but it goes about its mission very differently, providing the owner with a blisteringly fast sports coupe that, like the R8, feels more exotic than the Porsche, especially in the styling department.\n\nIn a move that may be pretty smart on Mercedes’ part, the GT S doesn’t seem to be aimed exactly at the base 911. It may be in terms of price, size and capability, but it provides a level of luxury, style and overall refinement that the 911 doesn’t have. It will appeal to people who aspire to a 911 for its cachet, but who aren’t necessarily as interested in what the 911 can do. Instead, they’ll filter over to their Mercedes showroom, where an equally capable — yet more dramatically styled and luxurious option — awaits them.\n\nIn that mission, the GT S may be more similar to the Jaguar F-Type or Audi R8, both of which are immensely capable; the Audi feels more exotic, and the Jag is more affordable. An intriguing option may be the Dodge Viper, which is now available with a customization program that makes each one an individual statement at no extra cost. But the Viper is less comfortable, less luxurious and far more of a handful to drive than the GT S. Compare the GT S, R8, 911 and Viper here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Porsche Panamera Turbo, Audi RS 7\n\nLooks like: Production version keeps most of what made the AMG GT Concept stunning\n\nDrivetrain: 429-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (GT 53); 577-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 (GT 63); and 630-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 (GT 63 S); nine-speed automatic transmission; standard full-time all-wheel drive with variable torque split\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2019 for GT 63 and GT 63 S, mid-2019 for GT 53\n\nThe 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, the first sedan developed exclusively by Mercedes-Benz’s AMG, brings to production a striking design that stays faithful to the AMG GT Concept’s “Sensual Purity” theme. The performance luxury stunner was a hit of the 2017 New York International Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2018 Geneva Motor Show News\n\nThe concept’s family resemblance to AMG’s high-end two-seaters also remains intact, including the rear end that appears taken from the AMG GT coupe. The car will have its official unveiling today at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show. A U.S. debut is expected at the 2018 New York International Auto Show.\n\nFor the U.S., this AMG GT hatchback sedan will be solely a four-door, four-seat fastback, though a five-seater will be offered in some markets. There will be two AMG 63 V-8 variants with up to 630 horsepower that will go on sale starting in early 2019; an inline-six AMG 53 model with a mild-hybrid system will follow later in the year. All have all-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission. Pricing has not yet been announced.\n\nExterior\n\nLike the concept, the production version of the AMG GT “4-door coupe” has a wide, deep grille, a hood that goes on forever and a fastback that slopes into a short, coupelike bootie with razor-thin taillights. Below the big mouth is an aggressive “jet wing” front bumper with gaping side inlets. As with the sleek new 2019 CLS, and the “coupe” effect is enhanced by the steep windshield rake, frameless side windows and the big wheel arches.\n\nExtra-cost appearance options include a Night Package with glossy black trim, a Chrome Package that goes the other way, and a couple carbon fiber trim packages, as well as aerodynamic options that amp up the aggressive looks; these can include an active, extendable rear spoiler.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior has an AMG version of the S-Class curving dash and dual 12.3-inch displays for instruments and multimedia controls behind a single sheet of glass. In the AMG GT, you can select one of three styles for the displays: Classic, Sport and a new Supersport. The latter offers additional AMG-specific information, such as a prompt for gear changes when the transmission is in manual mode.\n\nThe center display handles functions such as navigation, phone and vehicle data. The configurable instrument screen includes the expected gauges, as well as performance choices such as G-force or the current output and torque.\n\nDespite the sporty character of the GT, it’s still a big luxury car, and another S-Class touch inside is the available Energizing Comfort system with pre-programmed packages to set a cabin mood, varying climate control, seat control, massage functions, steering wheel heating and ambient lighting. It also includes varying scents, but the AMG GT gets one fragrance all its own that Mercedes describes as “sporty” (Axe body spray?)\n\nA new AMG steering wheel includes the ability to control the infotainment system using finger swipes on touchpads, and available is an add-on that includes on the spokes a round controller with integral display and extra control buttons.\n\nUpholstery and seat options range from performance seats to cushy quilted leather. Rear-seat options for the U.S. include a pair of non-folding carbon-fiber-backed seats and a 40/20/40-split, folding “executive” backseat that’s also available with its own touchscreen and controls.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nAn abundance of power is a given for all versions of the AMG GT, and the engines will be familiar from other models. The GT 63 features a 577- hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that puts out 553 pounds-feet of torque. For the GT 63 S, that output is boosted to 630 hp and 627 pounds-feet of torque, and the engine has standard active engine mounts (optional on the 63). The AMG 53’s inline-six puts out 429 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque. All are mated to nine-speed automatics and include torque-splitting, rear-bias all-wheel drive.\n\nThe inline-six includes a 48-volt mild-hybrid system with an electric motor that combines the starter and alternator, and contributes up to 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque. The system also includes a 48-volt battery to store energy and a converter to power a network for the conventional 12-volt accessories.\nMercedes estimates the AMG GT 63 and 63 S zero-to-60-mph times at a neck-snapping 3.3 seconds and 3.1 seconds, respectively. It estimates the AMG 53 at 4.4 seconds.\n\nThe V-8 models also include standard rear-wheel steering and an electronic locking differential, neither of which is offered with the six-cylinder. Also V-8-only (in the U.S.) is a Drift mode (standard on the 63 S, optional on the 63), in case you’re inclined to drift your very expensive car with very expensive tires. Suspension for the AMG GT 53 models includes steel springs and adaptive shock absorbers. The eight-cylinder models use multichamber air suspension. They also offer a performance ceramic brake option.\n\nDrivers can choose from up to six dynamic drive modes, depending on the equipment on the car, that vary the performance, handling and drive system characteristics. They are: Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, Race and Individual.\n\nSafety\n\nMercedes has not yet specified the exact safety and driver assistance tech on the AMG GT models, but says it will incorporate Mercedes’ current Intelligent Drive functionality. For the 2018 S-Class, that includes upgraded sensor technology that looks farther ahead and behind the car than previous models, and adaptive cruise control that employs navigation GPS and map data to adjust speed for upcoming curves, turns and intersections. Steering assist also is advanced beyond previous lane centering to handle tighter curves, more speeds and degraded lane markings, as well as assisting in keeping control in evasive swerves. It also now includes an automatic lane-change function.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Two-seat sports cars are vanishing from automakers’ lineups with increasing frequency as buyers gravitate toward chunky SUVs, but there remains a niche buyer who values the style, performance and exclusivity of an expensive grand touring car. The 2018 Mercedes-AMG GT is one of those cars, with its polarizing styling, tight cabin, severely limited cargo space and compromised outward visibility. But anyone in the market for a car like this ranks those issues at the bottom of their priority list. What the AMG GT has in spades is style, performance, presence — and the ability to put an earsplitting grin on the most stoic of faces on the dreariest rainy day.\n\nSmaller Motor, Missing Nothing\n\nAnyone who remembers this car’s predecessor — the much more expensive, gull-wing-doored Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG — may remember that car’s massive, hand-built 6.2-liter AMG V-8. At full chat, it sounded like a box of grenades going off in succession, a soul-twisting roar that startled birds out of trees and shook drivers to their core. When Mercedes chose a new twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 as the top engine in most of its AMG models, folks were skeptical it would deliver the same kind of visceral punch of the bigger, naturally aspirated motor.\n\nThe worry simply was not warranted. The power delivery of the turbocharged engine comes on like a tidal wave: smooth, forceful and relentless. In the base AMG GT, it cranks out 469 horsepower, but in the AMG GT C I drove, it’s bumped up to 550 hp (35 more than the GT S, 27 less than the GT R). Torque is rated at a stump-pulling 502 pounds-feet, and Mercedes says it goes from zero-to-60 in 3.7 seconds — and I believe it.\n\nThat quest is accompanied by an engine note that can sound like a muted burble or a ferocious roar depending on what drive mode you’ve selected and whether or not you’ve pushed what I call the exhaust-loudener button (AMG Performance Exhaust is standard on the AMG GT C). The AMG Dynamic Select controller dial lets you select between Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, Individual and Race modes. Select one of the racier sport modes and everything adjusts to more aggressive levels; the exhaust bangs and pops on accelerator liftoff, decelerating into corners like a racecar while making you grin and bystanders cringe. The engine is mated only to a seven-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission; it bangs off shifts with lightning crispness when you ask it to, but it’s just as happy to cruise around town with minimal drama when you’re looking to chill.\n\nThe handling characteristics of the AMG GT C are brilliant, as well. The steering feel has definite heft, with a weight that implies a lot of direct connection to the tires, and your reward is fantastic accuracy in controlling the car’s direction. Feedback is excellent, and the ratio is quick enough that you won’t be sawing at the wheel on tight bends as you might in other vehicles. Despite the massive 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels wrapped in high-performance tires, ride quality is astonishingly compliant thanks to a standard electronically adjustable Adaptive Damping Suspension.\n\nOpting for the C trim gets you a wider rear track, unique fenders, a limited-slip differential and rear-wheel steering, as well. It also bumps the performance potential of the AMG GT up beyond the mildly more powerful S, but it doesn’t quite enter the raucous world of the insane AMG GT R, with its track-minded suspension and traction control adjustability. The C gets a brake upgrade, too, with larger front brake rotors (though not the carbon-ceramic kind).\n\nWe can talk about fuel economy, but honestly, with a car like this, who cares? The AMG GT C is rated 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, but I honestly didn’t pay attention to what kind of mileage I was getting as I drove it over 500 miles from Detroit to Chicago and back; it’s of minimal consideration in a car that does what this one does and looks how this one looks. If you’re choosing the Porsche 911 GTS over this car because it’s rated 5 mpg better combined, your priorities may need some contemplation.\n\nInterior\n\nThe cockpit of the AMG GT C is luscious, filled with premium materials and exceptional artistry. What it’s not blessed with, sadly, is much in the way of user-friendliness: Space in this two-seater is at a premium, so you’re not going to find all kinds of bins and cupholders to stash your stuff — and let’s not talk about the severely limited trunk space that limits you to one moderately sized roll-aboard suitcase. But even items like the gear selector, which resides near the driver’s elbow, make me scratch my head. There’s also nowhere to stash a cellphon, aside from the cupholders or under the small center console doors. But that’s OK — you’re not going to want to use your phone much in this car anyway. You’ll want to focus on your driving.\n\nThe gauges and multimedia system in the AMG GT are due for an update, and they’ll get one in 2019, when all GTs are due for a new fully digital gauge cluster and updated Comand multimedia system. The new Mercedes-Benz MBUX system hasn’t made it to the AMG GT just yet, but the coming improvements should help — though Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available on the 2018 model, and it doesn’t look like they’re coming for 2019, either. The interior of the 2018 is still a lovely place, however, featuring an optional Burmester sound system with a subwoofer that uses the car’s internal structure to boost the bass. The result is amazing sound for a convertible, top up or down.\n\nSpeaking of that top, it’s a fabric power top with a steel, aluminum and magnesium structure aimed at helping lower the AMG GT’s center of gravity. It goes up or down in just 11 seconds and can be operated at speeds up to 31 mph. When it’s up, it does an amazing job of sealing the roadster against the elements and noise of the outside world. When it’s down, wind buffeting is admirably absent, but you can make it even better by installing a removable polycarbonate wind screen (though I found the screen tended to obstruct the already limited rear view).\n\nThe sport seats in the GT C come standard with Mercedes-Benz’s Airscarf system, which blows heated air out of neck-level seatback vents. On a chilly day, if you put the windows up, install the wind blocker, and turn on the heated seats and Airscarf, you’ll probably be too hot; despite having what appears to be three selectable levels, Airscarf seems to operate at just one temperature setting: volcanic. You’ll just have to drive faster in order to circulate the air more rapidly — such a problem to have.\n\nSafety\n\nThis being a Mercedes-Benz, safety is naturally a priority in the AMG GT. It has a number of advanced safety systems offered but not standard. It does have some basic systems, such as lane departure warning, blind spot warning and forward collision alert, but autonomous emergency braking and distance-keeping cruise control are extra-cost options.\n\nThe AMG GT has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is not uncommon for a low-volume luxury sports car.\n\nWhat Price, Exclusivity?\n\nShowing up at the country club in the best alternative yet to the Porsche 911 isn’t going to come cheap, nor should it. The AMG GT C starts at $158,995 including destination and a gas-guzzler tax. The C trim ranks third in the lineup, slotting above the base GT and GT S but below the track-minded GT R.\n\nWhile the R is great for the track, the C really is your best bet if you want maximum performance without compromising the GT’s lovely lines; the R gets wings and strakes that make it look a little too “fast ‘n’ furious” for some. Adding options like Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control, carbon-fiber trim pieces and the premium Burmester audio system brought the price of my test car up to $176,395.\n\nThis pricing matches up well against comparable Porsche 911s. The GT C slots in between the 450-hp, rear-wheel-drive Carrera GTS cabriolet, which starts at $134,050, and the 540-hp, all-wheel-drive Turbo cabriolet, at $175,150. As with all Porsches, options can easily add as much as $20,000 to the price of any model.\n\nIf you’d prefer something more shapely but still geared toward touring, the Maserati GranTurismo cabrio is a viable option. The 454-hp, Ferrari-V-8-powered convertible starts at $150,650, or you can bump up to the sportier MC trim for $161,220. A slightly less expensive — but no less able or appealing — entry would be the 575-hp Jaguar F-Type SVR convertible, at $125,000. Its snarling V-8 engine, drop-dead gorgeous looks and blistering speed make it a lovely British alternative to the Germans’ precision-oriented options.

      "expert_review": "Have you heard the one about the guy who didn’t buy a Mercedes-AMG GT because it was underpowered? Yeah, me neither. But just in case, the automaker announced some enhancements to the coupe and Roadster for 2021: more power and a new Stealth model.  \n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n\nFor the new year, the models get 54 more horsepower than the outgoing version. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 now makes 523 hp and rockets from 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds, a 0.2-second improvement.\n\nSome new equipment is also available this year: the AMG Ride Control suspension with adaptive damping adjustment, an electronic limited-slip differential on the rear axle, AMG high-performance composite braking system and red painted brake calipers.\n\nExterior\n\nA Stealth Edition model also joins the roster for 2021 with add-ons from the AMG Exterior Night Package such as black brake calipers, an AMG radiator grille in dark chrome, headlamps with black elements and mixed-size tires, with 19-inch matte-black Y-spoke wheels on the front and 20-inch wheels on the rear. Other Stealth Edition features include a carbon-fiber roof with dark-tinted areas on the coupe and a black soft top on the Roadster, as well as some paint choices: Stealthy black is standard; optional colors include Obsidian Black Metallic, Selenite Grey Metallic and Designo Graphite Grey Magno. \n\nInterior\n\nInside, cabin additions for the model include an AMG steering wheel in Dinamica microfiber with black steering-wheel spokes and shift paddles, diamond quilted black Nappa-style leather, black topstitching, piano-black lacquer or carbon-fiber trim and a special Stealth Edition badge.\n\nRelease Date and Price\n\nThe 2021 AMG GT coupe and Roadster will arrive at U.S. dealers in early 2021. Pricing was still “TBA.”\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster is striking to behold and even better to drive. It’s a true sports car, for better or worse — but mostly for the better. \n\nVersus the competition: You can find other sports cars with similarly impressive performance (for similarly staggering amounts of money), but the AMG GT C Roadster’s design — long hood, rearward-set cockpit and short rear deck — sets it apart from much of the competition. \n\nThe two-seat GT C Roadster is one of a handful of high-priced convertibles in Mercedes’ lineup: The S-Class convertible is a smooth and effortless cruiser, the SL-Class roadster is tuned a bit more for performance, and the GT C roadster is built for performance first. Comfort is a distant second. \n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster Video Review\n\nThe base GT Coupe starts at $116,895 (including a $995 destination charge), but the mid-level GT C Coupe is considerably more expensive, at $151,895; choosing the convertible version raises the price to $163,395. Our test car’s $179,795 as-tested price was higher still due to a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax and optional features like matte-blue paint, a carbon-fiber engine cover, adaptive cruise control and a Burmester premium stereo.\n\nThat Sports Car Feeling\n\nJust getting into the GT C reminds you it’s built to perform. The seating position is incredibly low, making stepping in and out an inelegant affair, and the bucket seats are stiff and highly bolstered. The seats include power-adjustable side bolsters for a tailored fit I appreciated in fast corners. After a few hours of driving, though, the firmness of the seat caught up with me in the form of a sore back. That hasn’t happened in a long time. \n\nMercedes has done a masterful job tuning the GT C’s chassis. The steering is direct and responsive, with an appropriate heft to the steering wheel, and the car’s low center of gravity helps it shine in corners; it just sticks and exhibits very little body roll. Take it out on your favorite winding road and have a ball.\n\nThe adaptive suspension that helps the car perform so well in corners, however, is a bit of a liability back in the world of stop-and-go suburban traffic. Even in its softest Comfort setting, the suspension is firm and unforgiving, transmitting even small bumps and breaks in the pavement. The suspension also includes Sport and Sport Plus settings, but the difference between the three modes isn’t dramatic; softer tuning for the Comfort mode would make the GT C more livable in everyday driving. \n\nWhat doesn’t need any work is the GT C’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The two are a potent pair: Mercedes reports a 3.6-second 0-60 mph time for the roadster. Acceleration is effortless, with more power at your disposal than you could ever legally use on a public road. The brakes are equally impressive at shedding speed, and the firm, linear brake pedal inspires confidence.\n\nDespite the incredible amount of power under the hood, the GT C is fairly docile in everyday driving. Gas pedal response is gradual in the Comfort drive mode, and the transmission makes smooth, unobtrusive shifts. If you decide to take control using the shift paddles on the steering wheel, you’re rewarded with quick gear changes. \n\nConvertible Commentary\n\nThe convertible version of the GT C comes with a three-layer power-folding soft top with a glass rear window. The top is quick — it takes only about 13 seconds to lower or raise it — and it operates at speeds up to 31 mph.\n\nHowever, the soft top severely restricts over-shoulder visibility when it’s up, especially over your left shoulder; I had to lean forward to look around the top when checking my blind spot. In certain situations, the windshield frame can block your view of overhead stoplights, forcing you to duck to see if the light’s turned green. Rear visibility isn’t great, either, regardless of whether the top is up or down; the backup camera is a necessity.\n\nEven though the top has three layers of material, a lot of road noise finds its way into the cabin at highway speeds. With the top down, however, cabin turbulence is minimal even while driving fast. The roadster includes a small glass wind deflector between the seatbacks. \n\nThe roadster’s 5.8-cubic-foot trunk isn’t affected by the lowered top, which stows in its own compartment. Even so, there’s not a lot of room for luggage. \n\nInterior and Multimedia\n\nThe rich interior quality Mercedes is known for is present in the GT C. The cabin — including the dashboard — is finished in Nappa leather, and most of the controls and surfaces have a premium appearance and feel. The drive mode and suspension controls on the steering wheel, however, feel a bit flimsy. \n\nThe driver and passenger are separated by a massive center console, but despite its bulk, it doesn’t offer much storage space; there’s just a shallow bin under the center armrest. The center console also includes a series of touch-sensitive controls, each with its own tiny display screen. The controls give the console a clean, tech-focused appearance, but the small screens are hard to see in direct sunlight. A 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument panel is standard.\n\nThe multimedia system includes a 10.25-inch dashboard screen and a console touchpad controller. It’s easy enough to use the touchpad to navigate the system’s various onscreen menus, swiping and depressing the touchpad as needed, but a supplementary tuning knob would be nice to have. \n\nThe multimedia system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. CarPlay started immediately when I connected my iPhone, and it uses the full width of the dashboard screen. The graphics are crisp and the CarPlay interface looks great, but the lack of a touchscreen means you have to use the console touchpad to select different apps. Given CarPlay is optimized for touchscreens, it’s not ideal. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro: Not for Amateurs\n‘Entry Level’ 2021 Mercedes-AMG GT43 Joins the 4-Door Coupe Lineup\nResearch Sports Cars\nShop for a 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT\nSafety\n\nLike other low-volume, high-priced sports cars, the GT C hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, a driver drowsiness monitor and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT C is an elegant luxury car that could probably get by on looks alone, but spending just a few minutes behind the wheel reveals how much more it is than just a stylish roadster. It’s all the more impressive when you consider the brand that builds it is mostly known for making comfortable, stately luxury cars. The GT C has enough luxury and tech features to not seem out of place alongside its Mercedes siblings, but its focus is driving performance, and in this it’s a thrilling success.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
