      "expert_review": "Just a few model years out from an overhaul that saw its AMG performance variants undergo a tectonic shift, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is little changed for 2025. The luxury sedan’s infotainment system is upgraded to Mercedes’ latest, third-generation MBUX technology, and there’s a new center airbag between the front seats to help reduce injuries from occupants banging into each other.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nFor the performance versions, AMG powertrain engineers found another 14 horsepower in the C43’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, bringing output to 416 hp. And while composite brakes are already standard on the AMG C-Classes, upgraded ceramic-composite rotors with gold calipers are now optional on the top-dog C63 S E Performance.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,150 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nC300: $49,600\nC300 4Matic: $51,600\nAMG C43: $63,650\nAMG C63 S E Performance: $87,200\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level C300 features 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a moonroof, power-operated trunk lid, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and start. Inside are power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging and 64-color ambient lighting. Standard cabin tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and an 11.9-inch touchscreen with voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Rear-wheel drive is standard. The C300 4Matic is identically equipped other than adding all-wheel drive and heated windshield-washer nozzles.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the AMG C43 gains an upgraded suspension with adaptive dampers, larger brakes with silver calipers and a 360-degree camera system in case you want to park yourself. The monster-output AMG C63 adds 19-inch wheels, composite brakes, a panoramic moonroof and a Burmester 3D surround-sound system.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe standard safety suite is relatively basic. Forward collision alert with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, front and rear parking sensors, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams are it — plus the incongruently high-tech automated parking.\n\nBut the Driver Assistance Package, available for a mere $1,950 on every trim level, adds oncoming and front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, automated lane changes, road-sign recognition that can adjust the vehicle’s speed to the current speed limit, and emergency steering assist.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nUnder the hood of the entry-level C300 is a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four making 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. All C-Classes are fitted with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The C300 returns an EPA-rated 25/35/29 mpg city/highway/combined; the 4Matic manages 24/33/27 mpg.\n\nThe AMG C43 also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four, but an electrically driven turbocharger that spools up faster helps it generate 416 hp and 369 pounds-feet; it comes with AWD. The EPA rates the C43 at 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nIn the AMG C63, a larger turbo and 201-hp electric motor on the rear axle vault total output to 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet. Turning that much grunt into forward momentum rather than smoke would be a lot to ask of just two tires, so it also has AWD. The C63 does, however, have a rear-drive Drift mode for buyers with a surplus in their rubber budget. The C63’s 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack is there more to add power than for electric travel, as the car is only capable of traveling about 3 miles before the engine fires up, per Mercedes.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance Review: My, What a Big Turbo You Have\n19 Vehicles Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C300 Review: Losing Its Way\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With the most powerful production four-cylinder engine in history, Mercedes-AMG’s latest C63 performance hybrid drives more like a tuner terror than a muscle car.\n\nVersus the competition: From a straight-line perspective, it’s no contest: There’s no BMW M3 or Cadillac CT4 Blackwing that can keep pace with the C63’s 671 horsepower and 752 pounds-feet of starting-line detonation — just make sure you’re OK with the soundtrack.\n\nI left my first drive of the elaborately named 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance with more questions than answers. This was preordained; Mercedes’ newest super-C represents what is perhaps the most radical departure from established form that we’ve seen from the power freaks in Affalterbach and is a rolling litmus test for what the general AMG customer seeks from those three letters.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance Priced From $85,050\n\nIt wasn’t the neck-wrenching pace of the C63 S E Perf … y’know what, we’ll just call it the “C63” from now on unless specified otherwise … as the dynamic capabilities and raw performance were never in question. Digesting the spec sheet is an indulgence on par with downing half a gallon of chocolate milkshake; a hand-built turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder screams out 469 horsepower and 402 pounds-feet of torque, making it the most powerful production four-cylinder in history, according to the company. An electric motor mounted at the rear axle adds 201 hp and 236 pounds-feet to the mix for a combined 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet — this in a car roughly the size of a Honda Accord.\n\nPetrifying Power\n\nThe power is just the tip of this technologic tour de force, as Mercedes also shoehorned rear-wheel steering, electric turbocharging, an adaptive suspension and a mechanical all-wheel-drive system backing up the nine-speed automatic transmission. Technically, there are three electric motors and two transmissions, with a motor putting the “electric” in “electric turbocharger” and one assisting the four-cylinder as a complex alternator and starter arrangement. A two-speed transmission supports the big motor out back, allowing it to reach the C63’s 174 mph top speed.\n\nThere’s also an electronically controlled limited-slip rear diff for good measure. Add to this a full suite of smaller goodies like Drift mode, a configurable exhaust and eight distinct drive modes, and you’ve got enough moving parts to make a clockmaker puke.\n\nHere’s what’ll make you puke: a sequence starting with a full-throttle pull in this hybrid hero that ends with hard braking into one of the many tight, technical corners squiggling through the canyons of Malibu, Calif. It’s visceral in a way unlike anything save perhaps a modified Nissan GT-R or Porsche 911 Turbo, offering similar levels of skin-rippling thrust and raw mechanical grip with a spooky-flat power curve and 40 mpg-equivalent combined.\n\nMercedes says the C63 dispatches 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds, but as the Germans are notorious for underrating their cars, expect a tested time closer to three seconds flat if not the high-twos. No matter — all you need to know is that it’s sensorily quick enough to have your passengers grasping for the grab handles in less time than it takes to say, “Watch this!”\n\nCanyon Care\n\nRidiculous acceleration is admittedly the hybridized C63’s primary party trick, as the rest of the dynamic character is distinctly similar to the prior V-8 C63. Ignore for a moment the wild drivetrain; if you were to hit the same tight, treacherous Malibu canyon roads in both generations back to back, there is little doubt in my mind that all driver-assist systems would stay on, and the pace wouldn’t be too far off. The roads are too tight, too blind and too rock-strewn to even consider engaging Drift mode — which, in the V-8 C63, was simply turning off traction and stability control for max ass sliding.\n\nIf you’re sliding around these roads, on which I have tested both generations of C63, you’re a public menace, full stop. That’s all to say you’re not able to take advantage of all 671 ponies on a canyon road; on a track, I’m absolutely positive the generational gap in performance and personality would be wider than the Mojave.\n\nReined in by blind corners and short straights, the new hybrid C63 beat the tarmac into submission with staggering confidence, bullying its own 4,817-pound bulk through chicaning tarmac not unlike the bigger, badder AWD E63 S of yesteryear. That’s up almost 700 pounds over the last generation C63 and about the same as the last-gen E63, but you almost wouldn’t know it from the way it feels when driving. It’s a dimensionally tight package, and a combo of 50/50 front-to-rear weight distribution and special dampers plucked from the skunkworks Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series keep body roll well in check.\n\nDynamite Dynamics\n\n… A bit too well, in fact. Outside of silk-smooth track tarmac, you’ll likely want to stick with the Sport or Comfort suspension setting, as even the latter is noticeably stiff for regular commuting. But all other points of input deliver typical AMG balance, with nicely weighted steering and a brake pedal that’s equally comfortable in highway traffic and  hard, extended canyon driving.\n\nA note on braking: Both my drive partner and I noted what felt like a variance in brake pedal firmness at times — completely unrelated to brake fade — which I chalk up to differences in regenerative braking engagement based on the drive mode; in its most aggressive setting, the system can feed up to 120 kilowatts of juice to the battery.\n\nSpeaking of the battery, it’s interesting hearing Mercedes talk about how this car is positioned. The brand reps on hand categorized the hybrid system in no uncertain terms as purely an augment for performance — and not for efficiency. Sure, there’s an all-electric mode that will stick solely with the zappy stuff up to 81 mph, but you’re limited to a manufacturer-rated 3 miles of all-electric range. The car’s 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery can be charged using a Level 2 setup or a household outlet.\n\nTurbo Terror\n\nThe purpose of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder is less ambiguous. Even taken in the context of AMG’s 416-hp flavor of this engine, 469 hp from an engine of this size is remarkable. You’d expect it to sound and feel like a dropkicked bag of bees as it does in the CLA45. Not so; whether damped intentionally by sound deadening or the state of tune, the four-banger in the C63 sounds less like a nitro-fed chainsaw and more like a buzzy, grumbly, rorty little four-pot that’s more baritone than banshee. It’s not the most sonorous engine inside or out, but its physical character is less muted, with ripsaw revs and excellent reactions that reward redline shifts and transmission kickdowns.\n\nAs you might expect, it feels a bit like a tuner car — which makes a whole lot of sense when you see the size of the big ol’ turbo that feeds the heart. Here, the electrification starts to make sense; torque fill is seamless and a welcome contrast to what I assume is the 2.0-liter’s ferocious, frenetic power delivery. Beyond the always-on lag-reducing function of the electric turbocharger, between 25% and 80% of the rear motor’s juice is available depending on the drive mode.\n\nEngage the kickdown button at the end of the accelerator pedal’s travel — the same button you get in most other German cars — and all 201 hp of the electric motor unlocks for 10 seconds. You’d think the most effective way of entering orbit would be to engage this overboost at every opportunity, but as the motor’s effectiveness wicks away at higher speeds, Mercedes claims the most efficient application is via the Boost Strategy app that’s premapped to an impressive 30 existing race circuits (with 40 more in the works). When engaged, an indicator on the drive cluster will tell you when to smack that overboost button for max effectiveness.\n\nV-8 Blues\n\nAs I was roadbound, I made excessive use of the boost function at every straight, for this supercar scramble is fun and tremendously impressive for a car of this size, weight and engine displacement. It is not, I fear, the experience current AMG customers seek — AMG products are not and arguably never have been purely about the numbers. Focusing purely on the “63” and bygone “65” families, these are deeply experiential cars that match BMW’s M lineup punch for punch with a dirty, primeval character that cuts the leather-wrapped cabin and austere styling with an incongruously guttural, metallic roar.\n\nV-8s aren’t forever, I know. Their time is rapidly dwindling, and it wouldn’t make much sense to give this generation of C-Class an eight-cylinder when the forthcoming E63 S E Performance is rumored to use a hybridized inline-six and the top-dawg S63 E Performance retains exclusive use of a hybridized 4.0-liter V-8. I found the 503 hp of the prior C63 S to be nearly perfect for the size and class, and it’s a selfish, silly thought to imagine AMG would be fine with carrying that over.\n\nWhen I think of a C63, I imagine a visually innocuous sedan tearing down an entrance ramp at supra-legal speeds, its staccato crackle echoing over a dark cityscape. This is likely just sentimentality wrapped up in fear of change. Maybe I’m in the minority, though, and maybe customer demand will be overwhelming, the days of the V-8 C63 fading into memory like air-cooled Porsches.\n\nOr maybe not. Rumors here, rumors there — all point toward the V-8-ification of the forthcoming CLE63. We’ll see. For now, look to the brutal, hyper-complex Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance to light your brain — but maybe not your heart — aflame.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance Priced From $85,050\n2023 Mercedes-AMG SL43 Quick Spin: Proof You Really Don’t Need a V-8\n577-HP 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Revealed\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe Starts at $57,650\nResearch 2024 Mercedes-Benz C63 S E-Performance\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has spent much of 2018 introducing us to various members of the C-Class family, which is of utmost importance to the German automaker as it is Mercedes' best-selling series of vehicles. The final C-Class variants to appear are the most exciting — the Mercedes-AMG C63 and AMG C63 S. Eventually, the C63 and C63 S will be offered in sedan, coupe and cabriolet body styles. Mercedes says all three body styles of the C63 will go on sale in early 2019. \n\n\n \n\nExterior\nMercedes-AMG C63 models can be distinguished from the C43 by their more aggressive exterior. That means squared-off quad tailpipes, larger side skirts and a different grille with vertical slats instead of the horizontal bar found on the C43. S versions add a larger rear diffuser.\n\nMercedes also offers an AMG Aerodynamics Package for coupe models, which makes each of the lower trim pieces more prominent, finishes the rear diffuser in high-gloss black and adds flics to the rear bumper.\n\nInterior\nThe Mercedes-AMG C63 will offer a wide range of interior colors and materials, along with a few unique features, including a new AMG steering wheel (optional on the C63, standard on the C63 S) finished in Nappa leather. The wheel comes with two touch control buttons, the one on the left for controlling the instrument cluster and the one on the right the multimedia system. Both buttons accept horizontal and vertical swiping motions. An AMG Drive Unit is optional; it adds a round controller with an LCD display below the right spoke of the steering wheel and two programmable buttons below the left spoke; the buttons can be programmed to modify AMG specific performance functions, so drivers can seamlessly switch between setting and modes without taking their hands off the wheel.\n\nPerformance seats are optional, as well, with added bolstering. Cabriolet models have standard Airscarf seat heating to keep front passengers’ necks warm with the roof lowered. The instrument cluster display also features several different AMG performance screens to show various performance metrics to the driver.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Mercedes-AMG C63 and C63 S both feature a hand-built bi-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The engine makes 469 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque in the C63, and 503 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque in the C63 S. The C63 variants are also differentiated from the C43 by their drivetrain setup; the C43 is rear-biased all-wheel drive, while the C63s are old-school rear-wheel drive with an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nStandard is an adaptive, electronically controlled damping system that can be tailored to provide comfort on longer drives or a more aggressive ride on the track or more interesting roads. An AMG sports exhaust system is standard.\n\nMercedes-AMG C63 S models also feature dynamic engine mounts; they are softer when cruising to reduce vibration and noise in the cabin, but stiffen up when driving dynamically to better control the weight moving around in the engine compartment.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class compact luxury car is available as a sedan, coupe or convertible. The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nA 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and heated front seats are now standard. There’s also a new Night Edition appearance package for the sedan that features black exterior trim, black 19-inch wheels, Night Edition badges, AMG sport seats and an AMG steering wheel.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower moonroof\nPower trunk lid\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n10.25-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking \nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nSport suspension and steering \nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHead-up display\nBurmester stereo\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nLane-centering steering\nRear automatic braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nWhile the C-Class favors comfort over driving performance, it’s still a poised and powerful compact luxury car. Interior luxury is a highlight, as is the car’s multimedia system. We also like the range of available body styles and engines. We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class compact luxury car is available as a sedan, coupe or convertible. The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C 43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C 63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nBlind spot warning, keyless access and a hands-free trunk lid are standard. The coupe and convertible also gain a Burmester premium stereo.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a 10.25-inch multimedia screen, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Available features include a digital instrument panel, navigation, a head-up display, wireless charging, three-zone automatic air conditioning, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a driver-drowsiness monitor. Available features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-keeping assist and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nWhile the C-Class favors comfort over driving performance, it’s still a poised and powerful compact luxury car. Interior luxury is a highlight, as is the car’s multimedia system. We also like the range of available body styles and engines. We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",
