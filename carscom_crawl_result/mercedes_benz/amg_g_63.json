      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 Still a Good SUV? \n\nIf what you want is a do-anything, go-anywhere, luxury performance SUV that’s just as at home at a film’s world premiere as it is in the Sahara, the Mercedes-AMG G63 is the best. Just make sure you can afford both its conspicuousness and its thirst for fuel.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 Stack Up Against the Competition? \n\nWhat competition? Seriously, very little could be considered direct competition for the G-Class. Off-road luxury and performance SUVs — like the Ineos Grenadier, Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 and Land Rover Defender — offer a somewhat similar experience but without nearly the same level of refinement, speed and interior comfort as the G-Class. They’re far less expensive than the Mercedes, too.\n\nGeneration after generation, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class remains a singular experience. It occupies a class of one: In a field of more capable off-roaders, faster performance SUVs and plusher luxury barges than the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63, no SUV sits so comfortably at the center of this Venn diagram.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 S E Performance Review: Character Study\n\nMuch like the Porsche 911, each major generational leap of the G-Class elevates it several steps above the prior one while perfectly preserving its core identity. More than any other car (including the Porsche), the G-Wagen has remained the most true to itself over the past 30 years. This character consistency, along with its unwavering position as one of Mercedes’ top status symbols, cements the G in all its forms as an automotive icon.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG G63, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nIs the G63 the Top G-Wagen?\n\nThe G-Class’ AMG versions remain particularly aspirational. The cheapest and least powerful G costs $149,400 (prices include destination) and packs 443 horsepower, making the Gelandewagen an objet d’exces in any form, but the 577-hp, $187,250 top-dawg G63 is as excessive as it gets.\n\nThe overmoneyed crypto class loves the G63. Its considerable slab-sided acreage and comprehensive suite of available chrome accents allows for maximum attention garnered when burbling down Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive or through Miami’s Design District — especially when coated in retina-searing highlighter colors like Sun Yellow or Green Hell Magno. Other than a black, silver or white lease-‘n’-release special, a G63 that’s not garishly glitzed up is a rare sight.\n\nSo, you can imagine my surprise (and delight) when a 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 showed up not only in the rather demure shade of Desert Silver Metallic — a primo $6,500 “Manufaktur” color I’d describe as light champagne — with blacked-out exterior accents and the optional $13,450 AMG Offroad Package Pro. My circle of G-loving friends and enthusiasts all agreed it was probably one of the least visually “AMG” G63s we’d seen thus far.\n\nAmong other things, that off-road package adds an extremely tacticool powder-coated roof rack with a corresponding mini ladder to the right of the real tailgate, all of which harmonized with the Night Package’s blacked-out bull bar and accompanying darkened badge kit. I love me a bright orange, chrome-dipped G, but this tastefully equipped G63 went a long way toward demonstrating the G63’s visual versatility.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG G63, engine | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 Still Fast?\n\nBut no G63 has even a remote capacity for subtlety. The “Mercedes truck” profile is unmistakable, and even the active exhaust can’t completely cork the menace of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8. As has been the case with all AMG V-8s since time immemorial, its soundtrack is guttural and metallic, an oily rumble that befits the G63’s power and size.\n\nThe G63’s 577 hp and mighty 627 pounds-feet of torque are enough for a 4.2-second 0-60 mph scoot — a prosaic number until you consider both this SUV’s aerodynamics and its 5,842-pound curb weight. Light-to-light hole shots and on-ramp blasts are pure theater; smacking the accelerator initiates a slight lurch as the nine-speed automatic transmission kicks down a bracket of gears — then the 4.0-liter explodes with a medieval roar. Its rear end observably squats under acceleration, raising the front half with just a hint of torsional twist.\n\nAcceleration is strong, but not oppressive in the way it can be in super-SUVs like the Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT and Tesla Model X Plaid. It’s undeniably quick, but it’s more fun than focused, feeling very much like you shouldn’t be allowed (by either law or physics) to move nearly 6,000 pounds with such ferocity. The physicality of the G63’s forward advancement and its echoing blat summons antisocial behavior from even the most placid drivers.\n\nIt’s a total hoot, as has been true of every full production AMG Gelandewagen since the 2002 G55. What hasn’t remained consistent is the G’s shocking contrast of composure and comfort with AMG hilarity and its genuine roots as a military vehicle. Now, the current W465-generation G is about as far removed from the original cloth-seat, four-cylinder 4×4 box as humans are from bananas — yet we still share genetic similarities with that comical fruit.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG G63, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63 Comfortable?\n\nIt’s all about juxtaposition. The G63 wears the finest interior materials of any Mercedes short of an S-Class while also maintaining body-on-frame construction and full-time four-wheel drive. There are available massaging seats and a premium Burmester sound system, perfectly complemented by three locking differentials and a suite of terrain-specific drive modes. Dual 12.3-inch displays with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are impressively configurable, as are Merc’s signature ambient lights that gently (or aggressively) suffuse the interior with your favorite hue. Meanwhile, the mechanical door locks sound like rifle bolts, and all five doors open and shut like bunker hatches with a supremely satisfying chunk.\n\nBut again, with the exception of the infotainment system and associated smartphone connectivity, the G has offered this fabulous mix of ludicrous and luxe for decades now. What sets each successive refresh or generational leap apart is how Mercedes manages to further compartmentalize its raw truck DNA within a wrapper that’s not that much less comfortable than a standard GLE.\n\nOther than some noticeable wind buffeting, this latest G63 is no more punishing or compromised than any other performance SUV — and if you drove any iteration of the long-lived “first-generation” W463 from 1990-2018, you’ll know that’s pure magic. I will say this latest G doesn’t feel significantly removed from the “second-generation” 2018-24 W463 outside the requisite tech and interior modernizations. Much of the modern G-Wagen’s irreplicable dual personality was born in this last generation, when the SUV abruptly evolved from a charming leather-lined V-8 tank to an actually livable — and luxe — super-SUV, with a day-to-day driving experience on par with other big-buck behemoths from Range Rover, BMW and elsewhere in the Mercedes lineup.\n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Mercedes-AMG G63?\n\nA quick sidenote on this generational changeover. I have but one major operational complaint about the 2025 G63, and it involves the new keyless entry doors. Until this new generation launched for the 2025 model year, every prior G in the U.S. market had remote locks operated exclusively via the key fob, without the option of keyless entry. Now, the familiar mechanized handles incorporate touch-to-lock on the surface of the handle along with keyless entry. It’s fantastic in theory but clunky in execution; I couldn’t quite figure out the cadence of when the door was properly unlocked, leading to more than a few instances of having to fish the key out of my pocket when the door either failed to unlock or, in the case when I preemptively unlocked it, relocked itself after grabbing the handle. No biggie, but G-Class buyers with established muscle memory might need to unlearn old habits.\n\nWithout the benefit of a back-to-back drive with the outgoing SUV, you’d have to delve into the spec sheet to suss out the biggest changes. The biggest, of course, is partial electrification across the entire G-Class range: Both available gas powertrains pack the same 48-volt mild-hybrid system with an integrated electric starter motor, which Mercedes says adds 20 hp and 148 pounds-feet of torque at low engine rpm.\n\nThose rare American G-Class buyers who do plan to take their 4×4 gigabrick off-road should absolutely spring for the AMG Offroad Package Pro — it ain’t just a roof rack and some mud flaps, it’s how you get the top-spec of the Active Ride Control suspension, which swaps physical antiroll bars for hydraulic hardware. This setup significantly alters roll stiffness, depending on setting. The Off-Road Package also unlocks off-road traction control configurable to seven distinct settings, as you would get in most track-focused AMG models.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Review: The Great Compromise\n2026 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition Stands Out, Subtly\nHow Much Is the 2025 Mercedes-EQ EQB SUV?\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE450e a Good Plug-In Hybrid SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\n2026 Mercedes-Maybach SL680 Monogram Series Ditches Backseat, Pours on the Chrome\n2025 Mercedes-AMG G63, rear | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat Does the AMG Offroad Package Pro Add?\n\nThe package adds a few more off-road tweaks, but seeing as my schedule didn’t allow for any off-road adventuring, I can merely confirm that the wideband adjustability of the package-specific Active Ride Control was lovely on unexpectedly craggy and fractured street surfaces around Los Angeles. I can think of no better daily vehicle from a comfort, character and capability perspective, provided you can afford both its conspicuousness and consumption. Over 196 miles, I averaged an indicated 9.8 mpg in contrast with the G63’s EPA rating of 14/16/15 mpg city/highway/combined. Did the G63’s soundtrack and general go-get-’em attitude have me driving like a nutjob? Yes. Will normal, well-adjusted city driving also likely fall at or under that 14 mpg watermark? Also yes.\n\nBut what a blast. The Gelandewagen has never, ever been better even if it’s mostly the same as it ever was. As far as I’m concerned, they should make the W465-generation G63 for another 30 years. Maybe then we can talk about adding more power.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nRedesigned last year, the five-seat Mercedes-Benz G-Class is one of the most expensive, most capable and most distinctive luxury SUVs in the world. It’s powered by a standard 416-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The high-performance AMG G 63 gets a 577-hp, twin-turbocharged V-8, and both SUVs have standard all-wheel drive. Competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover and Lexus LX 570. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nA G Manufaktur Program offers new ways to personalize the G-Class, and an AMG Trail Package is available. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include 19-inch wheels, a stainless-steel brush guard, a power moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front and rear seats, three-zone air conditioning, a 12.3-inch multimedia screen, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity and a Burmester premium stereo. Standard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist, a driver-drowsiness monitor and automatic high-beam headlights. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nWith its boxy, rugged exterior styling, the G-Class is the luxury SUV to buy if you want to be noticed. It packs an impressive level of off-road technology few owners are likely to use as well as a high-class interior and a powerful V-8 engine. Perhaps not surprisingly, this box is susceptible to crosswinds and has poor gas mileage.",

      "expert_review": "If you have the means to acquire a six-figure Mercedes-Benz SUV, hats off to you — you’re doing all right, aren’t ya? For the rest of us, well, we’ll just have to look on in envy as you decide which of Mercedes’ truly outrageous super-luxe SUV offerings is the right one for you.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class Is Formidable Foe to BMW X7\n\nThe German luxury automaker has several big, luxurious, ostensibly off-road-capable people movers that cost north of $100,000, but when two of them rolled through our Detroit bureau earlier this year, priced similarly yet vastly different in their demeanor and appeal, we wondered: If you have the means to afford either a 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 or 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600, which would you choose? Here’s our take on how these two titans of mall and trail stack up against each other — and our recommendation for which one might be right for you.\n\nThe Contestants\n\nIn one corner is the 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63, the top prestige model for the G-Wagen lineup (the G65 has not reappeared … yet). Massaged by the performance engineers at AMG, the big box has been given a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 hand-assembled and signed by a single technician; it pumps out 577 horsepower and 627 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an AMG-massaged nine-speed automatic transmission. Power is routed to all four wheels via a two-speed transfer case and axles with two lockable differentials.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nThe G-Wagen got a major update for the 2019 model year with significant changes to its suspension, wheelbase and interior, but Mercedes engineers were very careful to keep the iconic retro touches that a surprising number of buyers globally absolutely adore: the look, the parts, the off-road ability and even the way the doors close like a bank vault and the electronic locks clack like a rifle bolt slamming home. Price as tested: $182,545 (all prices include destination).\n\n2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nIn the other corner is the 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600, the new-for-2021 flagship luxury SUV that is meant to be the SUV equivalent to the company’s S-Class sedan. The Maybach trim is meant to denote something special, and special it is, from its looks to its ultra-opulent cabin. Like the G63, it’s also powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, but it puts out slightly less grunt at 550 hp and 538 pounds-feet of torque. You get a nine-speed automatic and 4Matic all-wheel drive here, too; you also get an air suspension and the remarkable E-Active Body Control. Other luxury touches abound, such as reclining rear seats with footrests, a fridge, champagne flutes for the backseat occupants and Nappa leather upholstery throughout. Price as tested: $165,850, but it can go a lot higher if you opt for things like the $18,500 two-tone paint or $5,500 23-inch wheels.\n\nStyle: AMG G63\n\nStyle is subjective, of course, but judging by comments from friends, family and internet folks, the G63 is the far more appealing choice based on style — and I don’t disagree. That iconic, quasi-military look has served the Gelaendewagen since its introduction as an actual military vehicle in the 1970s, and the latest update only makes it more appealing. The AMG versions look menacing, with blacked-out trim, big wheels and even that performance exhaust poking out the sides adding to the predatory aura. \n\nThe Maybach, on the other hand, just comes off as gaudy. Its massive chrome mesh bumper grille is the main culprit, which looks completely out of place on what is otherwise a clean, fairly anonymously shaped SUV. Yes, there are Maybach logos on the D-pillars to let passersby know this isn’t an ordinary GLS, but I think they got that message already if they happened to see it coming at them. \n\nStyle points go to the AMG in this match-up, for while a lot of other automakers have big, questionably tacky luxury SUVs, few have anything as dramatic and distinctive as the G63.\n\nComfort: Maybach GLS600\n\nAs much as the G63 wins out over the Maybach for outward styling, those positions swap completely when it comes to interior comfort. There’s no contest here: The Maybach GLS600 wins hands down. It’s far more spacious inside, with legroom in the first and second rows that dwarfs the G63’s narrower, shorter interior. Despite the bump in length that the G63 received for 2019, which turned its second-row bench into less of a penalty box, nothing tops the optional powered, heated and cooled twin recliners in the Maybach’s second row.\n\nIf that’s not posh enough for you, there’s a console between the seats that contains a set of champagne flutes, and behind that is an optional wine chiller fridge. Excessive? Totally. But in terms of interior coddling, the limousine-like executive accommodations of the Maybach GLS put it ahead here.\n\nUtility: Tie … Sort Of\n\nHere’s the problem with both of these SUVs: Neither one of them is very good at being an SUV. Each of them has issues with utility. The GLS600 can’t fit anything big in back because it has a sizable fridge smack in the middle of the cargo area, meaning it can fit two, maybe three suitcases to either side of it. And those big captain’s chairs don’t fold down, either; they’re fixed in position because they have a power recline. You can opt for a five-occupant setup and forgo the fridge and champagne flutes — but then, why splurge for a Maybach at all? \n\nOn the other hand, the AMG G63 isn’t very good at being an SUV, either. While it does have a pretty decently sized cargo area, it also has a super-heavy, manually operated, side-opening swing-gate instead of a power liftgate like the GLS. And if you want to fold down the backseats to accommodate something big, the front seats have to be moved forward a considerable distance, reducing the already tight front-seat room and keeping it reduced as long as the rear seats are down. \n\nSo yeah, this is a tie for the worst attributes. The best option would be a GLS450, which can swallow a lot of people or gear, but isn’t the prestige limousine that the Maybach is.\n\nDynamics: Maybach GLS600\n\nThe G63 has a completely different personality than the GLS600, and it shows up best in how it drives. The optional performance exhaust turns the G63 into a roaring, growling beast, and the side exhaust amplifies that by blasting that intoxicating snarl back into the cabin through the side windows. Subtle, it’s not, but it’s also tall, tippy, a bit bouncy and still demonstrates its off-road-capable roots through ride and handling that are secondary considerations to its style and presence. \n\nThe GLS600 is exactly the opposite, with its air suspension delivering a serene, coddling and glass-smooth ride. It goes beyond just Comfort mode on the drive mode selector with an actual Maybach mode, slowing all of the SUV’s responses down in favor of cosseting. It also has Mercedes’ magical E-Active Body Control, an electronic suspension system that uses predictive road scanning and driver input to bank the SUV into corners like an airplane, minimizing sideways centrifugal stress on occupants. It’s not as engaging to drive as the AMG G63, but it is far, far more pleasant.\n\nWow Factor: AMG G63\n\nMercedes may rank the Maybach sub-brand as its prestige model, but there’s no denying the practical prestige appeal of the G-Wagen. These SUVs are thick as flies in Southern California and had a cult following among the glitterati even before the update. This new one only compounds that desirability, with the same appeal the Jeep Wrangler has for a lot of its buyers. They want the image and are willing to live with compromises in drivability, comfort and utility that owning one brings. \n\nThe Maybach GLS600 really can’t compete with that. Its more anonymous shape, the still-obscure Maybach branding and oddly blingy, tacked-on chrome don’t give it the exclusivity cachet the G63 already features as standard.\n\nSo in the end, it’s really a question of what you want your SUV to be: a limousine or a personal statement. The Maybach GLS600 is the definitive choice if you want to be chauffeured to an event in maximum comfort, but the AMG G63 is the one to choose if your arrival is the event.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nThe five-seat Mercedes-Benz G-Class is one of the priciest and most attention-grabbing luxury SUVs on the market. The G-Class is derived from a military vehicle, and its blocky shape makes it stand out everywhere it goes. Under the hood is a 416-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine that’s paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. The performance-focused AMG G63 has a 577-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine and an even more raucous growl when you hit the accelerator. The hyper-expensive G63 4×4 Squared version gets specific trim touches and off-road-focused fortifications, like a raised suspension, heavy-duty axles and 22-inch wheels on all-terrain tires. The G-Class’s competitors include the Ineos Grenadier, Land Rover Range Rover, Lexus LX 600 and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nThe G-Class enters the 2024 model year with no significant updates or changes. A refreshed version — including an all-electric variant — is slated to arrive for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n19-inch wheels\nStainless-steel brush guard\nPower moonroof\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front and rear seats\nThree-zone air conditioning\n12.3-inch multimedia screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBurmester premium stereo\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nMassaging front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRear-seat entertainment system\nSide exhaust outlets (AMG G63)\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class?\n\nThere’s no doubt about it: The G-Class is an over-the-top choice even among the most extroverted luxury SUVs. Those rugged looks are backed up by potent drivetrains and serious off-road capability. Stiff crosswinds can get the G-Class a bit unsettled, however, and let’s not overlook the simple fact that the base model commands more than $140,000. This jumps to around $185,000 for the AMG G63 variant and almost $360,000(!) for the G63 4×4 Squared.",
