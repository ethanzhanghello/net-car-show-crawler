      "expert_review": "Americans would have been lousy hunters and gatherers. That’s why we invented Costco.\n\nThe buy-it-by-the-barrelful mentality perpetuates the American need to gather too much stuff while hunting for a deal. I’ve gone broke saving money at this mega-volume store.\n\nFor some, the problem with Costco is the same as the problem with many SUVs: Both offer too much and are just too big for practical purposes.\n\nNo one tows a boat to work every day, and no one needs 200 frozen chicken breasts. Downsizing is the new upgrade, but that doesn’t mean a new vehicle should not include all of the amenities a driver wanted in his big SUV.\n\nThe 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 is nearly perfect compact hauler. Chock-full of all of the high-tech luxuries you’d expect with a Mercedes, it’s downsizing made pain-free, at least if you can afford it.\n\nThere’s no third row or big V-8 in this vehicle. Its narrow, small body makes it an ideal suburban hauler for small families who enjoy quick trips into the city. The all-wheel drive system will help during even the trickiest of weather conditions — though a slightly less expensive rear-wheel drive model is also available.\n\nBut don’t let its diminutive nature fool you (it’s about the same length as a Honda Civic). There’s lots of room inside the cabin — enough to handle a trip to the aforementioned store in Livonia. There, I overindulged myself on fantastic deals: A case of wine, a few giant cans of coffee and a year’s supply of paper towels and toilet paper — all of which fit easily in the back with the second row folded down. (There’s more than 54 cubic feet of storage space available when you put down the seats.)\n\nReally, despite its size, it never felt too small. It even drives big\n\nThe exterior is much more defined than much of its competition, such as the BMW X5. It’s as if the sheet metal was stamped twice just to make a point. The cut edges give it a much more truck-like look, and the high roofline helps it avoid looking too much like an oversized station wagon. Even the three-pointed star in the grille looks slightly oversized. It looks and feels like a compact SUV.\n\nIt even drives big. While the 3.5-liter V-6 creates 268 horsepower, more than enough juice to get GLK350’s 4,000-pound body hitting 60 mph in under seven seconds, it still feels heavy on the road. This could be because I loaded it up with another 200 pounds of groceries in the back, but it’s also a combination of the GLK’s soft tuning on its independent suspension.\n\nMercedes uses an agility control system, designed to stiffen the vehicle’s ride on smoother roads and loosen it up on Detroit’s streets. I did not notice when it identified the road as smooth or rough; the ride always felt soft. The GLK’s heavy feel didn’t seem to hinder its handling. With its sticky 20-inch optional wheels — as part of the $970 appearance package (19-inch wheels are standard) — and its speed-sensitive hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering with variable centering, the GLK felt very agile. The seven-speed automatic transmission was so smooth that you often heard the vehicle shifting but never really felt it.\n\nThe vehicle’s gas mileage was disappointing, averaging 17 miles per gallon in a mix of typical city and highway driving. The EPA estimates for the GLK350 with all-wheel drive is 16 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway — in comparison, a four-wheel drive Hummer H3 gets 14 mpg in the city and 18 on the highway. Additionally, the GLK350 requires premium fuel.\n\nMy all-wheel drive test GLK seemed to handle itself very well through big sweeping turns and tight city corners. Cruising through the Costco parking lot, its small size allowed me to squeeze into a space most SUVs would never attempt. A stylish package\n\nThe GLK350 is entering its second model year in the U.S., and Mercedes has added a few new features, including an individual tire pressure monitoring system, leather-wrapped steering wheel, a keyless start system and a passenger side mirror that tilts when you shift in reverse.\n\nBut it’s the features that come standard with the GLK350 that make it begin to feel like a deal — as much of a deal as Mercedes can offer. The base model GLK starts at $33,900, and the all-wheel drive model starts at $35,900; neither includes $875 shipping. My test vehicle offered nearly $10,000 in options, so its final price was $45,935, which could downsize your wallet more than anything else.\n\nThat’s certainly not cheap, but the GLK gives you everything you want wrapped in stylish package.\n\nThere are the interior features such as the eight-way power adjustable front seats to provide the perfect seating position. The eight speaker stereo system, with an auxiliary jack for a personal music device, to create the exact sound you want and even a dual climate control with dust filter to provide the cleanest air possible. It feels very Mercedes.\n\nFrom the heavy stitching on the seats to the easy-to-read instrument cluster behind the tilting and telescoping steering wheel, the GLK350 makes you feel important. It caters to your sense of craftsmanship and style. It makes a statement about you that only a Mercedes can make. Elegant and well-to-do, you appreciate the finer things in life. At least that’s the message it’s supposed to send out to the world.\n\nThere also more high-brow features, such as adaptive headlamps that turn when you turn the steering wheel and rain-sensing wipers on the windshield and rear window. Mercedes also loads up the GLK 350 with lots of safety features, including six air bags, electronic stability control, roll-over sensor system and its high strength steel body cage that can protect the people inside the cabin.\n\nIn the end, the GLK350 is a lot like Costco.\n\nIt’s not a matter of simply saving money, but what you get for every dollar.\n\nAnd a deal is always in the eye of the beholder.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\n2010 Mercedes Benz GLK350 4Matic\n\nType: Five-passenger, all-wheel drive SUV\n\nPrice: $35,900*\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6\n\nPower: 268 horsepower, 258 pound-feet torque\n\nEPA gas mileage : 16 mpg city / 21 mpg highway\n\n* Price does not include $875 shipping\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: *** 1/2\n\nExterior: Excellent. Crisp lines and boxy looks give the GLK350 a diminutive trucky look.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Well laid out interior provides all of the comforts you’d expect in a Mercedes.\n\nPerformance: Good. All-wheel drive and powerful V-6 gives this SUV lots of get up and go, but vehicle still feels heavy.\n\nSafety: Excellent. Six air bags, electronic stability and traction control. Mercedes’ continued focus on safety is deservedly legendary.\n\nPros: Loaded with lots of content and features, the GLK350 feels luxurious and sporty.\n\nCons: Can top $45,000 when fully loaded.\n\nGrading scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2009 about the 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK350. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIt’s funny how an automaker can be ahead of the curve one moment and playing catch-up the next. Mercedes-Benz helped make luxury SUVs mainstream when it debuted the midsize M-Class for the 1998 model year, but when it comes to small luxury crossovers, the German automaker is a latecomer with the new 2010 GLK350. It seems the time was well-spent, though, as the crossover offers the luxury, comfort and technology expected of models in this class.\n\nSome other manufacturers are also playing catch-up, as the segment gains two other new models this calendar year with the debut of the 2009 Audi Q5 and 2010 Volvo XC60. The GLK350 has one of the lower base prices in this segment, but the total rises quickly when you add some options. My well-equipped all-wheel-drive test model, for example, had an as-tested price of about $50,000.\n\nExterior & Styling\nA number of the GLK350’s competitors, like the XC60 and Infiniti EX35, have sleek exterior styling that favors smooth lines over right angles. The Mercedes, meanwhile, maintains the traditional upright shape of an SUV; it looks a little bit like a shrunken version of the automaker’s larger GL-Class. It wears this look rather well, with enough design cues in the sheet metal to keep things interesting.\n\nThe optional Appearance Package changes the look of the GLK350 by adding aluminum roof rails and 20-inch alloy wheels. Also available are aluminum running boards that add $660 to the price tag. They don’t look like traditional running boards, but are more similar to the side sill extensions on the BMW X5. Like the X5’s side sills, they’ll dirty your pant legs when stepping in or out if you’re not careful. They’re not necessary, because it’s easy to step in and out of the Mercedes without using them.\n\nRide & Handling\nWhen I first saw the wheels on my test GLK350 — those 20-inch rims and low-profile all-season tires — I was a little worried about how it would ride on Chicago’s crater-filled roads. To my surprise, the GLK350 handled this rugged urban landscape with ease, preventing ride quality from becoming jarring. Sure, the taut suspension controls body motions, but it doesn’t do so at the expense of passenger comfort the way some crossovers do. The standard 19-inch rims come with tires that have slightly taller sidewalls, which should make for an even more compliant ride.\n\nWhether you’re driving in the city or the suburbs, the GLK350 is easy to maneuver, but it doesn’t do much to engage the driver. The steering offers little in the way of feedback, and the wheel is very easy to turn. This is typical of Mercedes models in general, and while it works in a full-size sedan like the S-Class, it doesn’t fit the GLK350 as well. Whereas some cars decrease the amount of power-assistance at higher speeds for a greater sense of straight-line stability, the GLK350 feels about the same then as when driving at slower speeds.\n\nThe GLK350 cruises comfortably on the highway, as the suspension limits the effects of bumps and holes in the road. Highway speeds further affirmed an impression that developed when traveling around town, and that’s just how quiet the cabin of the GLK350 is. Ambient and wind noise are effectively muted, leaving you to enjoy the audio system or just the silence. Even when accelerating aggressively, engine noise isn’t intrusive.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nA 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is standard. The engine moves the GLK350 rapidly when you want, and the seven-speed automatic transmission consistently shifts smoothly no matter if you’re driving leisurely or aggressively. The transmission includes Comfort and Sport modes in addition to a clutchless-manual setting if you prefer to control shifts yourself.\n\nThe GLK350 can easily keep pace with fast highway traffic, and the V-6 still has some grunt left in it for high-speed acceleration, though not enough to take you aback. Downshifts are easy to induce by prodding the gas pedal.\n\nIt took me a little longer than normal to get used to the crossover’s brakes. While there’s an adjustment period when moving to any new vehicle as you adapt to its characteristics, the significant amount of brake pedal travel that’s required to initiate strong braking in the GLK350 is outside the norm and took me by surprise when first driving it. The brakes have good linearity, which is something that’s lacking in some of Mercedes’ other models, but they’d be nicer if they were more responsive higher in the pedal’s travel.\n\nThe Inside\nMercedes has been reshaping its lineup for the past few years, and the interiors of models like the C-Class and new E-Class have taken on a more angular appearance. That’s true in the new GLK350, too, which features bold swaths of aluminum trim on the dashboard and doors (burl walnut wood trim is optional). The overall appearance is quite luxurious, trimmed in high-grade materials.\n\nThe GLK350’s seats are finished in standard MB-Tex simulated leather, but real leather upholstery is included in the optional $1,750 Full Leather Seating Package, along with the wood trim. MB-Tex does such a good job impersonating the real thing in terms of appearance and texture that I initially thought my test model was equipped with leather. The front bucket seats have supple cushioning and are supportive thanks to a long bottom cushion that provides good thigh support. They feel like a favorite chair that makes your muscles relax the minute you sit in it. Heated front seats and a driver’s-side memory feature are optional.\n\nMost controls are logically arranged, and numerous features are accessible in multiple ways. For example, you can select the optional navigation system by pressing a button on the dash or by using the Comand system’s multifunction controller on the center console. Comand comes with the navigation system, and of the knob-based systems out there, like BMW’s iDrive and Audi’s Multi Media Interface, it’s one of the better ones thanks to intuitive onscreen menus. BMW, however, has closed the gap significantly with its latest generation of iDrive. The GLK350’s air conditioning controls, however, aren’t in the best spot; they’re very low on the dash.\n\nThe backseat is fairly tight for adult passengers and feels a little smaller than the XC60’s. With the driver’s seat adjusted for my 6-foot-1 frame, I had to sit with my legs to either side of its backrest in order to have enough legroom. The 60/40-split backseat’s backrest is nicely reclined, however.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe GLK350’s cargo area measures 23.3 cubic feet. With the backseat folded there’s 54.7 cubic feet of total cargo space. When the backseat is down, the extended cargo floor is fairly flat.\n\nCargo Room Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind Backseat\tBackseat Folded\nAcura RDX\t27.8\t60.6\nAudi Q5\t29.1\t57.3\nLand Rover LR2\t26.7\t58.9\nMercedes-Benz GLK350\t23.3\t54.7\nVolvo XC60\t30.8\t67.4\n\nWhen properly equipped with the optional trailer hitch, the GLK350 is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system and active front head restraints.\n\nOptional Features\nA number of packages and individual options are available for the GLK350. The Premium Package bundles a number of features, including a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, a memory feature, Sirius Satellite Radio and rain-sensing windshield wipers for $3,150. The Multimedia Package goes for $3,350 and includes the Comand multifunction controller, navigation, a six-disc Harman/Kardon entertainment system and a backup camera.\n\nThe Lighting Package features swiveling bi-xenon headlights with washers and LED taillights for $970. Individual options include parking sensors ($790), an iPod connection kit ($375) and a dual-screen rear entertainment system ($1,880). Choosing 4Matic all-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive adds $2,000.\n\nGLK350 in the Market\nThere’s no question the GLK350 is a worthy contender in the compact luxury crossover segment thanks to its comfortable ride, quiet cabin and smooth powertrain. It’s a logical addition to Mercedes’ lineup, and one that should have come along sooner.\n\nNow that the brand with the three-pointed star has an offering in this segment, there’s a whole lot more pressure on models like the BMW X3 and upcoming Audi Q5. The only thing Mercedes needs now is buyers willing to plunk down serious money to take a GLK350 home. The recession, however, could prove more formidable than the GLK350’s actual competitors.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMercedes-Benz entered the small luxury crossover segment in 2010 with the GLK-Class, which seats up to five people in two rows. Offered in GLK350 form with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and either rear- or all-wheel drive, it features recognizable Mercedes styling cues and available high-tech features.\n\nThe GLK350 competes with luxury crossovers like the Audi Q5, Acura RDX and BMW X3.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nWith its angular exterior styling, the GLK350 bears a strong resemblance to its big brother, the GL-Class. The GLK350’s large front grille is divided by horizontal bars, and in the middle is a large Mercedes three-pointed star.

Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 19-inch alloy wheels\nOptional 20-inch rims\nOptional panoramic moonroof and power liftgate\nOptional adaptive bi-xenon headlights, cornering lights and LED taillights\n\nInterior\nModels equipped with Mercedes’ optional Comand system have a knob controller on the center console that’s used to navigate menus on the 7.5-inch dash screen. Among knob-based control systems, Comand’s interface is one of the more intuitive ones available. The system’s screen can show things like radio station information and map data from the navigation system. For 2012, the media interface moves to the center console. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard simulated leather upholstery\nOptional leather\nFront bucket seats and three-seat rear bench\nOptional “mbrace” communication system\nReal wood and aluminum trim\nStandard dual-zone automatic air conditioning\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GLK350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that produces 268 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz offers a suite of vehicles that are comfortable, capable, refined … and fussy, and the 2013 GLK-Class is no exception.\n\nAnnoyances like complicated multimedia controls, a smaller-than-average cargo area and a clumsy automatic stop/start system undermine the otherwise appealing 2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 SUV.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLK-class competes with compact luxury crossovers like the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX. See them compared here.\n\nA 2013 update brings a little more horsepower, additional safety systems, a revised interior and a lightly refreshed exterior. See the two model years compared here. Early in 2013, a diesel model will join the V6-powered GLK350 4MATIC we review here.\n\nHaute Couture?\nWhat would “Sex and the City’s” Carrie Bradshaw drive? According to Mercedes, the answer is a Mercedes-Benz GLK-class. In 2009, the SUV debuted in the eponymous movie, notifying all urban fashionistas that the compact SUV was the hottest new accessory out there. Or is it?\n\nThe GLK’s styling is too severe and rugged, trading the curves of compact luxury crossovers like the X3, Q5 and SRX for severe angles and blocky lines. Its tall outline, sculpted sides and creased profile look very masculine and would be better worn by Jeep. To wit, my husband loved its “manly look.” At the other end of the spectrum is Land Rover’s Range Rover Evoque; its svelte silhouette and sexy curves would be this girl’s ultimate accessory.\n\nMore exterior chrome trim for 2013 accents new LED head- and taillight treatments, increasing the glam factor, but all the bling in the world won’t blunt the GLK’s rough-looking mug. Inside, however, it’s all about coddling.\n\nA Cabin that ‘Comands’ Attention\nAs expected in this segment, the interior is nothing less than luxurious. Like the exterior, it’s not understated, but it never crosses the line into gaudy. High-gloss burl walnut wood trim is plentiful and lovely; it starts on the dash and carries through the back. Although the seats are a leather substitute that Mercedes calls MB-Tex, it’s convincing and feels high-quality. The real-leather seats package is a $2,100 option and is standard on some competitors, like the Q5. Huge, chrome-ringed vents set a retro tone and complement the tastefully styled cabin.\n\nThe comfortable power front seats can have lumbar support (part of a pricey option package), and the seat bottom cushion is long, providing plenty of thigh support. One of my favorite convenience features is also among the simplest: dual extendable sun visors.\n\nUnfortunately, the annoyances started canceling out the interior’s niceties as soon as the key was turned. (Yes, I actually had to turn a key to start it; keyless access and engine start is a $650 option.)\n\nMultimedia systems in luxury vehicles are typically complicated, and our editors argue over which is the least troublesome, but I find Mercedes’ Comand to be fussy and almost comically complicated. Too many steps are required to achieve one function. Accessing radio presets, for example, requires drilling down into different menus using the control knob. The knob is in a handy location near the center console, but a touch-screen would be so much easier.\n\nOperating the available navigation system is equally frustrating. You’re required to dial through the alphabet to pick off each number and letter of an address. In the end, I opted for the fast and sane choice: the navigation app on my smartphone.\n\nThe system’s fussiness reared its head again and again. The backup camera goes off and the Bluetooth phone connection is severed when you turn the radio off. (In order to keep using them in silence, you’ll have to mute the radio.) Drivers will eventually get accustomed to Comand and its quirks, but they’d be better served by the relatively intuitive touch-screen systems in the Evoque or Infiniti’s EX35.\n\nThe Things We Carry\nThe optional panoramic moonroof lends an expansive feel, but in reality the quarters are pretty tight. At 5-foot-5, I had enough space in the front, but competitors offer more. Nothing in this class will feel downright roomy, but with 40.7 inches of front headroom, the X3 has the GLK (39.8 inches), Q5 (39.4) and SRX (39.7) beat. Models with sunroofs typically lose roughly an extra inch of headroom. For front legroom, though, the GLK ekes out about a half-inch more than its competitors. It trades that for backseat space, however: With just 35.1 inches of rear legroom, most passengers will feel pinched. The crown here goes to the Q5, with 37.4 inches of rear legroom. The GLK’s backseat also doesn’t slide or recline, a perk.\n\nCargo space is at a premium, too. The GLK has only 23.3 cubic feet behind its backseat, a few inches shy of the Q5, X3 and SRX. The backrests fold down, but the seats are bulky and the action is awkward. Seats down, there’s 54.7 cubic feet of space, which is also puny compared with the X3’s 63.3 and the SRX’s 61.1 cubic feet.\n\nOn the positive side, a low cargo floor eases loading, and there’s a bit of underfloor storage. For bulky items, you’ll have to remove the cargo cover, another awkward maneuver.\n\nSmall-item storage in the cabin is meager, highlighted by a tiny center-console box and a small bin under the instrument panel. For 2013, the shifter was relocated to a steering-wheel stalk, opening up space for a small bin under the instrument panel.\n\nBackseat passengers can flip down the center armrest to access another tiny storage bin and pop-down, flimsy-feeling cupholders. Unfolding them is another multistep procedure.\n\nTo Eco or Not to Eco?\nInitially, how the GLK drives depends a lot on one little button: The new-for-2013 Eco automatic stop/start system. When the feature is engaged, the engine shuts off while stopped at traffic signals and automatically restarts when your foot leaves the brake pedal. It’s jarring, both in sound and feel. The transition could be smoother, as it is in many hybrids and some of Mercedes-Benz’s V-8-powered models.\n\nThere’s also a slight lag in accelerator response while the engine restarts. Thankfully, you can turn off the feature using a clearly labeled button. I left it on roughly half the time.\n\nMy observed fuel economy was impressive: 23 mpg over 230 miles of mostly highway driving, in line with the EPA-estimated 19/25 mpg city/highway rating.\n\nThe 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 builds ample power quickly. The gas pedal is a bit touchy upon takeoff, however, giving acceleration a nonlinear feeling.\n\nThe seven-speed automatic is alert — bordering on hyperactive — but the shifts could be smoother. Mercedes-Benz says the transmission adapts to individual driving styles and adjusts shift points accordingly; I don’t think we had enough time to truly get acquainted.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLK-class’ electric power steering also takes some acclimation. It’s firm and heavy-feeling at lower speeds and felt very light at higher speeds, to the point where it needed near-constant adjustment.\n\nOn the road, the GLK exhibits a high level of composure; only large bumps unhinge it. It rides comfortably on alloy wheels, if a touch firmly, and feels much more compliant than the X3.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the GLK350 received the highest score, Good, across all tests, earning it Top Safety Pick status. The GLK250 diesel hasn’t been tested. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hadn’t tested the GLK as of this writing.\n\nThe GLK comes standard with a full complement of airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side-curtain airbags alongside the front and rear seats. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOptional safety features include lane departure warning, forward collision warning, blind spot warning and Active Blind Spot Assist. The latter automatically intervenes to correct the car’s course if the driver doesn’t heed the initial blind spot warning and continues to change lanes. (The forward-collision feature doesn’t apply braking as some Mercedes-Benz models do.) A drowsiness detection system is newly standard.\n\nThe blind spot system worked well but is quirky. Below 20 mph, yellow triangles are constantly illuminated in the side mirrors. Above 20 mph, the triangles disappear, replaced by red ones when your blind spot is occupied. With the lane-keeping system, if you change lanes without signaling or wander into another lane, the steering wheel vibrates — an effective warning.\n\nVisibility to the rear and in the corners is decent thanks to a tall ride height, small backseat head restraints and a large rear window. Exposed Latch anchors ease child-safety seat installation; click here for the full car seat check.\n\nFeatures & Price\nRear-wheel-drive versions of the GLK350 start at $37,995 (all prices cited include destination charges). All-wheel drive adds $2,000. Niceties like the Premium Package (which includes the panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, driver’s seat memory and satellite radio), a multimedia package (backup camera and Comand), heated seats and the Lane Tracking Package (including blind spot and lane keeping assist) brought our car’s as-tested total to $47,835.\n\nThe GLK may have an appealing base price, but many of the features that are standard on competing all-wheel-drive models are optional here: Heated seats, standard on V6 versions of the Q5 ($43,875), are a $750 option on the GLK. Similarly, MP3-player capability is standard on the SRX ($43,885) but is a $310 option on the GLK.\n\nMercedes-Benz GLK in the Market\nIt might seem crazy to shell out for a small vehicle that could easily cost $50,000. Apparently, though, if you build them, people will come. During the first six months of 2012, sales of the GLK and its rivals are up and the class is expanding, with the recent addition of the Range Rover Evoque.\n\nBuyers shopping this segment expect a just-right blend of luxury, comfort and technology. Choose your options carefully, and the Mercedes-Benz GLK-class delivers … if you can overlook its quirks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMercedes-Benz offers a suite of vehicles that are comfortable, capable, refined … and fussy, and the 2013 GLK-Class is no exception.\n\nAnnoyances like complicated multimedia controls, a smaller-than-average cargo area and a clumsy automatic stop/start system undermine the otherwise appealing 2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 SUV.\n\nThe GLK competes with compact luxury crossovers like the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Cadillac SRX. See them compared here.\n\nA 2013 update brings a little more horsepower, additional safety systems, a revised interior and a lightly refreshed exterior. See the two model years compared here. Early in 2013, a diesel model will join the V-6-powered GLK350 4MATIC we review here.\n\nHaute Couture?\nWhat would “Sex and the City’s” Carrie Bradshaw drive? According to Mercedes-Benz, the answer is a GLK. In 2009, the SUV debuted in the eponymous movie, notifying all urban fashionistas that the compact SUV was the hottest new accessory out there. Or is it?\n\nThe GLK’s styling is too severe and rugged, trading the curves of compact luxury crossovers like the X3, Q5 and SRX for severe angles and blocky lines. Its tall outline, sculpted sides and creased profile look very masculine and would be better worn by Jeep. To wit, my husband loved its “manly look.” At the other end of the spectrum is Land Rover’s Range Rover Evoque; its svelte silhouette and sexy curves would be this girl’s ultimate accessory.\n\nMore exterior chrome trim for 2013 accents new LED head- and taillight treatments, increasing the glam factor, but all the bling in the world won’t blunt the GLK’s rough-looking mug. Inside, however, it’s all about coddling.\n\nA Cabin that ‘Comands’ Attention\nAs expected in this segment, the interior is nothing less than luxurious. Like the exterior, it’s not understated, but it never crosses the line into gaudy. High-gloss burl walnut wood trim is plentiful and lovely; it starts on the dash and carries through the back. Although the seats are a leather substitute that Mercedes calls MB-Tex, it’s convincing and feels high-quality. The real-leather seating package is a $2,100 option and is standard on some competitors, like the Q5. Huge, chrome-ringed vents set a retro tone and complement the tastefully styled cabin.\n\nThe comfortable power front seats can have lumbar support (part of a pricey option package), and the seat bottom cushion is long, providing plenty of thigh support. One of my favorite convenience features is also among the simplest: dual extendable sun visors.\n\nUnfortunately, the annoyances started canceling out the interior’s niceties as soon as the key was turned. (Yes, I actually had to turn a key to start it; keyless access and engine start is a $650 option.)\n\nMultimedia systems in luxury vehicles are typically complicated, and our editors argue over which is the least troublesome, but I find Mercedes’ Comand to be fussy and almost comically complicated. Too many steps are required to achieve one function. Accessing radio presets, for example, requires drilling down into different menus using the control knob. The knob is in a handy location near the center console, but a touch-screen would be so much easier.\n\nOperating the available navigation system is equally frustrating. You’re required to dial through the alphabet to pick off each number and letter of an address. In the end, I opted for the fast and sane choice: the navigation app on my smartphone.\n\nThe system’s fussiness reared its head again and again. The backup camera goes off and the Bluetooth phone connection is severed when you turn the radio off. (In order to keep using them in silence, you’ll have to mute the radio.) Drivers will eventually get accustomed to Comand and its quirks, but they’d be better served by the relatively intuitive touch-screen systems in the Evoque or Infiniti’s EX35.\n\nThe Things We Carry\nThe optional panoramic moonroof lends an expansive feel, but in reality the quarters are pretty tight. At 5-foot-5, I had enough space in the front, but competitors offer more. Nothing in this class will feel downright roomy, but with 40.7 inches of front headroom, the X3 has the GLK (39.8 inches), Q5 (39.4) and SRX (39.7) beat. Models with sunroofs typically lose roughly an extra inch of headroom. For front legroom, though, the GLK ekes out about a half-inch more than its competitors. It trades that for backseat space, however: With just 35.1 inches of rear legroom, most passengers will feel pinched. The crown here goes to the Q5, with 37.4 inches of rear legroom. The GLK’s backseat also doesn’t slide or recline, a perk.\n\nCargo space is at a premium, too. The GLK has only 23.3 cubic feet behind its backseat, a few inches shy of the Q5, X3 and SRX. The backrests fold down, but the seats are bulky and the action is awkward. Seats down, there’s 54.7 cubic feet of space, which is also puny compared with the X3’s 63.3 and the SRX’s 61.1 cubic feet.\n\nOn the positive side, a low cargo floor eases loading, and there’s a bit of underfloor storage. For bulky items, you’ll have to remove the cargo cover, another awkward maneuver.\n\nSmall-item storage in the cabin is meager, highlighted by a tiny center-console box and a small bin under the instrument panel. For 2013, the shifter was relocated to a steering-wheel stalk, opening up space for a small bin under the instrument panel.\n\nBackseat passengers can flip down the center armrest to access another tiny storage bin and pop-down, flimsy-feeling cupholders. Unfolding them is another multistep procedure.\n\nTo Eco or Not to Eco?\nInitially, how the GLK drives depends a lot on one little button: The new-for-2013 Eco automatic stop/start system. When the feature is engaged, the engine shuts off while stopped at traffic signals and automatically restarts when your foot leaves the brake pedal. It’s jarring, both in sound and feel. The transition could be smoother, as it is in many hybrids and some of Mercedes’ V-8-powered models.\n\nThere’s also a slight lag in accelerator response while the engine restarts. Thankfully, you can turn off the feature using a clearly labeled button. I left it on roughly half the time.\n\nMy observed fuel economy was impressive: 23 mpg over 230 miles of mostly highway driving, in line with the EPA-estimated 19/25 mpg city/highway rating.\n\nThe 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 builds ample power quickly. The gas pedal is a bit touchy upon takeoff, however, giving acceleration a nonlinear feeling.\n\nThe seven-speed automatic is alert — bordering on hyperactive — but the shifts could be smoother. Mercedes says the transmission adapts to individual driving styles and adjusts shift points accordingly; I don’t think we had enough time to truly get acquainted.\n\nThe GLK’s electric power steering also takes some acclimation. It’s firm and heavy-feeling at lower speeds and felt very light at higher speeds, to the point where it needed near-constant adjustment.\n\nOn the road, the GLK exhibits a high level of composure; only large bumps unhinge it. It rides comfortably, if a touch firmly, and feels much more compliant than the X3.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the GLK350 received the highest score, Good, across all tests, earning it Top Safety Pick status. The GLK250 diesel hasn’t been tested. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hadn’t tested the GLK as of this writing.\n\nThe GLK comes standard with a full complement of airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side-curtain airbags alongside the front and rear seats. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOptional safety features include lane departure warning, forward collision warning, blind spot warning and Active Blind Spot Assist. The latter automatically intervenes to correct the car’s course if the driver doesn’t heed the initial blind spot warning and continues to change lanes. (The forward-collision feature doesn’t apply braking as some Mercedes models do.) A drowsiness detection system is newly standard.\n\nThe blind spot system worked well but is quirky. Below 20 mph, yellow triangles are constantly illuminated in the side mirrors. Above 20 mph, the triangles disappear, replaced by red ones when your blind spot is occupied. With the lane-keeping system, if you change lanes without signaling or wander into another lane, the steering wheel vibrates — an effective warning.\n\nVisibility to the rear and in the corners is decent thanks to a tall ride height, small backseat head restraints and a large rear window. Exposed Latch anchors ease child-safety seat installation; click here for the full car seat check.\n\nFeatures & Price\nTwo-wheel-drive versions of the GLK350 start at $37,995 (all prices cited include destination charges). All-wheel drive adds $2,000. Niceties like the Premium Package (which includes the panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, driver’s seat memory and satellite radio), a multimedia package (backup camera and Comand), heated seats and the Lane Tracking Package (including blind spot and lane keeping assist) brought our car’s as-tested total to $47,835.\n\nThe GLK may have an appealing base price, but many of the features that are standard on competing all-wheel-drive models are optional here: Heated seats, standard on V-6 versions of the Q5 ($43,875), are a $750 option on the GLK. Similarly, MP3-player capability is standard on the SRX ($43,885) but is a $310 option on the GLK.\n\nMercedes-Benz GLK in the Market\nIt might seem crazy to shell out for a small vehicle that could easily cost $50,000. Apparently, though, if you build them, people will come. During the first six months of 2012, sales of the GLK and its rivals are up and the class is expanding, with the recent addition of the Range Rover Evoque.\n\nBuyers shopping this segment expect a just-right blend of luxury, comfort and technology. Choose your options carefully, and the Mercedes-Benz GLK delivers … if you can overlook its quirks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class’ small footprint and nimble, refined driving experience stand out, despite its otherwise dated luxury experience.\n\nThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 4Matic could very well be the last GLK — in name, anyway. Mercedes is revamping its model nomenclature, so the successor to the GLK-Class crossover will be the GLC, which is rumored to be released as a 2016 model. Even after a mild 2013 refresh, the GLK is showing its age compared with Mercedes’ latest and greatest cars, like the 2015 C-Class sedan.\n\nIntroduced for 2010, the GLK received a minor refresh for 2013 with a new engine, an interior update and a slightly tweaked exterior. Compare the 2015 with the 2013 and 2010 here. I tested a simply optioned GLK350 with 4Matic all-wheel drive; its cost was $45,025 with a destination fee. The Mercedes-Benz GLK350 starts at $38,825 with rear-wheel drive, while an all-wheel-drive, diesel-powered GLK250 is available starting at $40,325.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class’ chiseled appearance and square roofline stand out in a crowded segment of mostly soft-styled luxury SUVs. The GLK’s traditional SUV styling makes it appear larger than it really is: Bumper to bumper, the GLK is 4.3 inches shorter than the Audi Q5, 5.2 inches shorter than the Acura RDX and a sizable 9.5 inches shorter than the Lexus RX 350. It’s even shorter — by 0.9 inches — than a segment newcomer, the 2015 Lincoln MKC. Compare the GLK to its longtime competitors here and to the MKC here.\n\nThe GLK’s upright shape provides fantastic visibility from the driver’s seat thanks to tall windows, thin body pillars and a squared roofline. Small side mirrors are the only weak spot in the GLK’s otherwise commanding view of the road.\n\nHow It Drives\nA well-sorted suspension and tight steering connect the GLK to the road with supreme levels of sure-footedness. The available full-time all-wheel-drive system does the same in snowy and slippery conditions; it’s well worth the $2,000 premium it commands. A tight 37.6-foot turning circle and extremely nimble nature make the GLK a master of city driving; U-turns and tight corners are easily conquered by the sprightly SUV. Benz calls the GLK-Class midsize, but it drives like a much smaller compact SUV.\n\nSmall turbocharged engines are gaining popularity in other Mercedes-Benz cars and SUVs for their increased fuel economy, and it’s possible you’ll see a turbocharged offering in the GLK’s successor. If that’s the case, I’ll miss the current GLK’s standard powertrain: a naturally aspirated 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6. Sure, fuel economy could be improved from the all-wheel-drive’s 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined figures, but it’s hard to replicate in a turbocharged one the punchiness of a good naturally aspirated engine. The GLK’s V-6 offers a potent punch of acceleration, with instantaneous accelerator response and a healthy V-6 growl under the hood. A BlueTEC diesel-powered GLK250 is rated 24/33/28 mpg with standard all-wheel drive and is one of a few diesel-powered SUVs in the segment.\n\nOther noises inside the GLK aren’t as pleasant, like the intrusive wind you’ll hear whistling past the exterior at high speeds. The excessive noise is almost like a light switch that turns on at 50 mph and above, marring an otherwise refined highway driving experience, as the GLK tracks true on the highway with minimal fuss.\n\nInterior\nThe GLK’s cabin isn’t claustrophobic despite having a decidedly more compact exterior than competing SUVs. The rear seat, however, is tight. It’s not an uncomfortable experience, like you’ll find in Mercedes’ smaller GLA-Class SUV, but it’s snug and the backrest is raked at an awkward angle without any adjustable reclining function. Much larger SUVs like the RX 350 have hugely roomy backseats; I even found the Q5’s slightly larger backseat more comfortable than that of the Mercedes-Benz GLK.\n\nThe interior is put together with decent materials, providing a satisfactory luxury experience. Not one particular finish stands out, however, and the design as a whole is somewhat uninspiring. Our test car was equipped with the standard MB-Tex imitation leather upholstery, which I find convincing enough. Leather upholstery, which is standard on the base Acura and Audi, is an $1,850 option here. Our GLK test car featured no-cost burl walnut wood trim, heated front seats ($750) and the Premium Package ($3,450), which included a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, 115-volt AC household outlet and more.\n\nThere isn’t much new blood in this aging class of SUVs except for the Lincoln MKC, which provides a surprisingly luxurious experience for the money and a much more interesting, high-tech interior than the GLK. You’d think the GLK hadn’t been redesigned for some time, and from the ground up it hasn’t been, but it was touched up for 2013 with a new dashboard and interior materials. The update, though, merely brought the GLK up to an average level of quality. Given what we’ve seen Mercedes accomplish with the all-new 2015 C-Class compared with its previous generation, there’s promise for a GLK successor to make a big leap in the interior finish and design department.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMultimedia technology is moving at lightning speed, and the GLK’s standard multimedia system is stuck in the Stone Age. The system might not have been as big a disappointment if we hadn’t already grown enamored with Mercedes’ latest high-resolution-plus-touchpad technology in the C-Class.\n\nThe GLK-Class’ standard 5-inch screen is simply not enough real estate to legibly display the many functions of the GLK’s central controller system, which is used to control radio, media and car functions. The graphics are also dated. A 7-inch screen is available with navigation and a backup camera as part of a $2,970 Multimedia Package. Lincoln’s MKC includes a standard 8-inch touch-screen with much higher-quality graphics, plus two USB ports.\n\nBluetooth hands-free phone connectivity, Bluetooth streaming audio and a USB port for thumb drives are standard, and a Media Interface option allows the use of an iPod or iPhone through the GLK’s audio controls (it’s a $310 stand-alone option and is also part of the aforementioned $3,450 Premium Package). Our test car came with an Apple 30-pin connector for older iPhones. Mercedes’ website says an Apple adapter is required for use with the eight-pin Lightning connector used on later-model devices.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe GLK’s small stature doesn’t show on the inside until you need to use the cargo area, which measures just 16.5 cubic feet behind the backseat. The RDX has 26.1 cubic feet, the MKC 25.2 cubic feet, the Q5 has 29.1 cubic feet and the RX — as its significant size suggests — has the most, at 40 cubic feet. Using the cargo area was at least easy thanks to our test car’s power liftgate, which is included in the Premium Package.\n\nWith the 60/40-split folding backseat down, the GLK has a maximum cargo capacity of 54.7 cubic feet. That’s smaller than its competitors; the closest in size is the Q5’s 57.3 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest score of good in all crash tests to which it’s been subjected, which currently excludes the small overlap front crash test. A score of good or acceptable would earn the agency’s Top Safety Pick Plus designation for the GLK. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not crash-tested the GLK as of this writing.\n\nSee here for a full list of standard safety features; a backup camera isn’t one of them. Instead, the camera is packaged into an expensive $2,970 Multimedia Package. Luxury automakers haven’t adopted the standard backup camera as readily as some non-luxury automakers, such as Honda.\n\nMercedes includes six months of its mbrace telematics system standard, which includes emergency response and 24-hour support. Active-safety options include a Lane Tracking Package with blind spot monitoring and lane keeping assist for $875. Available Pre-Safe Brake — as part of a $2,950 Driver Assistance Package — can help prevent an impending collision by sounding an alert and braking the vehicle when an imminent collision is detected. That package also includes blind spot monitoring, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe compact-to-midsize luxury SUV segment isn’t the freshest lineup at the moment. The GLK, Audi Q5 and RX 350 all have a few years under their belts, and the GLK-Class feels the most dated of the three. An all-wheel-drive GLK350 like our test car starts at $40,825, and with $750 heated front seats and a $3,450 Premium Package, it added up quickly to our $45,025 as-tested price.\n\nAt $45,025, the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class didn’t include a backup camera, smart keyless access with push-button start, or navigation — features you can add to the Q5 and MKC easily for the same price. Those cars also bring much more contemporary interiors and additional cargo space. The GLK is one of the best-driving luxury SUVs in its segment, but it’s less well-rounded — in usefulness and design — than its competitors.\n\nemail",
