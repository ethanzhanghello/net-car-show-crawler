      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes EQS?\n\nThe Mercedes EQS Sedan and SUV are the German luxury automaker’s flagship electric vehicles. Both body styles have five seats, and the SUV offers an optional third row for a seating capacity of seven. The sedan has a hatchback-style trunk lid and cargo area, giving it improved versatility over a traditional sedan. Both body styles are available in three trim levels: 450+ (with a 355-horsepower, single-motor rear-wheel-drive powertrain), 450 4Matic (with a 355-hp, dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain) and 580 4Matic (with a 536-hp, dual-motor AWD powertrain). Exclusive to the Sedan is a high-performance EQS AMG trim with a 649-hp version of the EQS580’s powertrain. The EQS SUV offers an ultraluxury Maybach EQS680 variant that also has 649 hp and AWD along with decadent trim and coddling luxury features. \n\nAmong the EQS lineup’s noteworthy available features are a 56-inch Hyperscreen digital dashboard, rear-axle steering, massaging rear seats, and a detachable touchscreen tablet for backseat passengers. The Maybach EQS680 even offers massaging calf rests, a beverage chiller and silver champagne flutes. The EQS sedan’s rivals include the Audi E-Tron GT, BMW i7, Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan and Tesla Model S. The EQS SUV competes with the Audi Q8 e-Tron, BMW iX, Porsche Macan EV, Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes EQS?\n\nThe EQS Sedan gets new regenerative-braking software and a larger, 118-kilowatt-hour battery for improved driving range, as well as exterior styling tweaks, including a new grille design. In addition to the aforementioned updates, the AMG EQS Sedan also gains a center airbag between the front seats as standard equipment. \n\nThe EQS SUV gets additional standard equipment and an optional Automatic Comfort Door Package that enables fully automatic closing of the front and rear doors. The SUV’s uplevel Exclusive and Pinnacle trims gain a high-efficiency particulate air cabin filtration system. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Mercedes EQS Have?\n\nThe EQS’ EPA-estimated driving range runs from 302 to 390 miles, depending on body style, trim level and drive wheels.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Mercedes EQS?\n\nThe EQS battery can be charged from 10% to 100% in about 12 hours using a typical 240-volt Level 2 charger. You’ll need only 30 minutes to go from 10% to 80% when using a Level 2 DC fast-charging connection. These times apply to both the Sedan and the SUV.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes EQS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n56-inch curved-dash Hyperscreen\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nPower-operated trunk or liftgate\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmbient interior lighting\nWireless device charging\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\n15-speaker Burmester audio system\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nBlind spot warning\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive air suspension  \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNappa leather upholstery\nHead-up instrument display\nFour-zone climate control\nRear refrigerator\nCabin fragrance diffuser\nHeated rear seats\nFolding seatback-mounted tables\nMassaging front and rear seats\nDetachable touchscreen tablet for backseat passengers\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes EQS?\n\nWhether you choose the Sedan or the SUV, the Mercedes EQS is a tech-forward EV packed with cutting-edge features — almost to the point of overkill. The newly standard 56-inch Hyperscreen dashboard looks like something from a sci-fi movie, but its myriad functions will require time and patience to master, and it’s prone to distracting glare and reflections. Acceleration is a strong point across the line: It’s brisk in 450 trims and stunningly fast in higher ones. The Sedan’s passenger space and ergonomics are disappointing for a large flagship vehicle, though, so unless you prioritize style, the SUV is the more versatile and practical choice — especially given it’s priced about the same as the Sedan.",

The expansive 56-inch Hyperscreen curved-glass dashboard is now standard on every EQS, and some trims get increased horsepower and driving range.
