      "expert_review": "The four-eyed face of the Mercedes-Benz CLK looks like a baby E-class sedan, but slide behind the wheel and the snug fit of its cockpit-like interior reinforces the fact that it is smaller and sportier than the mid-size E320.\n\nEven though it rides on the same basic chassis as the C-class sedan, the CLK is oriented toward drivers who want 215 horsepower, crisp handling and a rock-solid feel. Its two-door coupe body, with steeply slanted windshield and curved rear roofline, is not only handsome, but one of the most stylish in the Mercedes line.\n\nPrices for the CLK starts at about $40,000. This fall there will be two more models: a cabriolet, for $47,200, and a the powerful CLK430, with a 275-horse, 4.3-liter V8 and AMG sport package, for $47,900. My test drive, however, was confined to the V6-powered CLK320.\n\nWhereas the C280 sedan has a 2.8-liter V6, the CLK320 gets the larger 3.2-liter V6 that is also used in the E-class. This newly-designed engine, the first V6 ever designed by Mercedes, shares much of its basic architecture with the 4.3-liter V8, and that necessitates a balance shaft to tame some inherent vibrations. Three valves per cylinder, two intake and one exhaust, as well as two spark plugs per cylinder, have been employed to improve efficiency and lower emissions.\n\nOn the road, this engine is smooth. Throttle response, typical of Mercedes-Benz, is linear, and you have to push deliberately to get full performance. When you do, however, the CLK’s transformation is as dramatic as Superman slipping off his business suit. A two-stage intake manifold aids low-speed response without penalizing high-rpm power. It zips to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds, according to factory figures, and has a top track speed that is electronically limited to 130 mph.\n\nThe transmission is a five-speed automatic. Its gearshift lever moves through a gate on the console, and that enables it to be shifted without looking at the lever with some practice. This transmission adjusts its shift patterns to match the driver’s habits, and, to some extent, even road conditions. A “winter” mode selects second gear for starts in slippery conditions.\n\nThe CLK showcases electronic technology in a variety of ways. Here are some examples:\n\nBrake Assist recognizes emergency braking and applies full braking force because tests have shown that even experienced drivers don’t always use full braking force in a panic stop.\n\nASR traction control limits wheelspin in rain or snow.\n\nESP, or Electronic Stability Program, is an option that applies an individual brake to keep the vehicle from sliding out of control on slippery roads.\n\nA unique electronic key replaces the standard mechanical key. This unit slips into the ignition lock and an infrared sensor sends data to it. If the correct code is sent back, the car starts. Unlocking the doors and trunk is done with buttons on the remote unit.\n\nSafety items include st andard anti-lock brakes plus front and side airbags.\n\nThe cabin is cozy because of a large central console that runs between the seats. Wood trim, which adds a touch of warmth, is abundant. Instrumentation consists of simple gauges, like all other Mercedes.\n\nThe steering wheel telescopes, but does not tilt.\n\nFront seats are well-contoured, and support your lower back like a giant hand. Like most German cars, the seats have firm padding, and while not everyone likes that, I do because it is comfortable for long stints behind the wheel.\n\nThe back seat is intended for occasional use and has fairly tight legroom. Fortunately, it folds forward for expanded carrying capacity.\n\nSo who will buy the CLK? I suspect the target buyer is one who has a high income, rarely uses the back seat and wants the sportier look and performance of a coupe as opposed to a sedan.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car, a 1998 model, was $39,850. The 1999 model will start at ,600.\n\nOptions on our test car included the Quartz Blue paint, integrated compact disc changer and power sunroof.\n\nThe sticker price was $43,020.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years and 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The CLK is handsome, quick and elegant. It steps out smartly, rides firmly and has great seats.\n\nCounterpoint: The back seat is not very big, and the lack of a tilt wheel made it hard for me to find an ideal driving position.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 105.9 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,240 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $39,850\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $43,020\n\nMPG RATING: 21 city, 29 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "It is a Bordeaux-red fantasy powered by a 275-horsepower engine. The seats are leather, supple in feel and cream in color. Walnut wood trims the instrument panel and center console. Deep-pile carpeting covers the floor.\n\nIt is the 1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK 430 coupe, a stunning work of art in “Park” and a demon in “Drive.”\n\nBut there is no need for a car such as this. It is a fillip in a world gone mad, a finger-snap amid the thunder of artillery and falling bombs. It is an indulgence, a motorized demarcation between the haves and have-nots.\n\nYet it is unquestionably beautiful, irresistibly seductive, the electromechanical definition of lust. Perhaps it’s what war is all about–envy and covetousness turned hostile.\n\nA story: It was Saturday. I was wearing khaki pants, a sweat shirt and battered tennis shoes. With gray hair, tortoise-shell glasses and brown skin, I was sporting the Bill Cosby look, perfectly friendly and likable.\n\nBut I was driving the CLK 430. Other motorists, black, white and yellow, gave me the bum’s rush. They wouldn’t let me into traffic. They cut in front of me. One woman–deliberately, it seemed–refused to move on green until I honked my horn. In return, she shouted through her driver’s window: “If you’re so [expletive] rich and in such a [expletive] hurry, why don’t you fly?”\n\nWould she have done and said those things if I’d been behind the wheel of a Hyundai? I don’t think so.\n\nNone of this is the CLK 430’s fault, of course. The car was built with affection for people who love cars and who can afford to choose from among the best available. The CLK 430, in terms of sheer driving pleasure, is one of the best.\n\nBut it is best enjoyed on lonely roads, where the hum of its 4.3-liter V-8 engine and the tread whir of its 17-inch-diameter tires produce a harmony unencumbered by the sneers and sniffs of motorists driving more sensible cars.\n\nThat does not mean the CLK 430 is entirely whimsical. There’s lots of good design here, lots of smart engineering.\n\nTake the rear seats. A “coupe,” in U.S. auto industry parlance, is usually a closed car with two doors and two usable seats. That is true even for most 2-plus-2 coupes, which offer seating for four people, assuming that the two rear passengers can be disassembled and boxed before entering the car.\n\nBy comparison, four adults can sit comfortably in the CLK 430. Mercedes-Benz’s “Easy Entry System,” which automatically moves the front seats forward, eliminates the hassle of getting to the rear.\n\nThe car’s four-wheel independent suspension system is tops. There is no discernible body sway or lean, not even in the tightest curves. That’s important for safety. A super-stable car tends to compensate, within reason, for errant driver behavior.\n\nThere are numerous other smart things, such as Mercedes-Benz’s patented “Brake Assist,” an advanced, computer-driven anti-lock system specifically designed to reduce stopping distances in panic braking.\n\nBut none of those technological marvels has anything to do with the social politics of the CLK 430–how it fits into a public mind wracked by class divisions, by warring perceptions of who is entitled to what.\n\nIt is a case of beauty and the beast. The car is the beauty. The world is the beast.\n\n1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK 430 Coupe\n\nComplaints: Itty-bitty trunk, barely 11 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nPraise: A car lover’s dream. Excellent build quality. Solid. Exceptionally well balanced in terms of feel and performance. And, despite its impracticality–lesser cars have more utility–it does have some welcome nods to common sense.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Clean, classic coupe design. Far more stunning on the road than it is on photographic paper.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces. It is the car as sport, driving for the pleasure of driving. Tremendous launch, zero to 60 mph in about 6 seconds.\n\nSafety: A motorized vault filled with items such as side-impact air bags, advanced anti-lock brakes, traction control and electronic stability control.\n\nEngine: A 4.3-liter V-8 designed to produce 275 horsepower at 5,750 rpm and 295 pound-feet of torque between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm.\n\nLayout: Front engine, rear drive.\n\nCapacities: Seats four. Holds 16.4 gallons of gasoline; premium unleaded recommended.\n\nMileage: Not great. About 21 miles per gallon in city and highway driving. Estimated range is 330 miles.\n\nPrice: Base price is $47,900. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $41,670. Price as tested is $51,135, including $2,640 in options (such as the glass sunroof) and a $595 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A wonderful toy. If you can pay, you can play.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe CLK-Class is sold as either a convertible (Cabriolet) or a coupe. CLK competitors include the Jaguar XK and BMW 650.\n\nNew for 2009\nFor 2009, the CLK350 is available in a Grand Edition, a high-end trim level that’s limited to 500 coupes and Cabriolets each. All models now come with standard heated seats and six-disc CD changers.\n\nExterior\nMercedes-Benz’s three-pointed star sits at the center of a low, wide grille. Twin ellipses form a single headlight unit on each side of the grille. Elegance is the CLK350’s front-end theme, while sportiness takes precedence in the CLK550. The CLK is shorter and smaller than the Jaguar XK and BMW 650.\n\nChrome tip exhaust\nSide-view door mirrors with turn-signal indicators\nRedesigned 18-inch wheels in the AMG Sport Package\nAMG wheels and unique body paint on Grand Edition\n\nInterior\nThe CLK holds four occupants on leather-upholstered seats; the rear seat is split and folds. Passenger volume measures 85.2 cubic feet. Grand Edition models include a brown leather interior with beige-stitched seams and aluminum trim (coupe) or dark brown ash trim (Cabriolet).\n\nAutomatic dual-zone air conditioning with a sun sensor\n10-way power front seats and rain-sensing wipers\nHarman Kardon seven-channel digital surround-sound stereo\nRemote automatic trunk closer option\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe CLK has several powertrain options:\n\n268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 (258 pounds-feet of torque)\n382-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 (391 pounds-feet of torque)\n475-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 (465 pounds-feet of torque)\nSeven-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nCabriolet models disguise sensor-controlled roll bars as head restraints. When front occupants close their doors, an arm extends to deliver the seat belt buckle.\n\nFour side-impact airbags\nCabriolet’s front-seat side-impact airbags provide head and thorax protection\nCoupes have full-length side curtain airbags\nAntilock brakes and an electronic stability system\nEmergency assistance system\nOptional parking radar",

      "expert_review": "The name may sound like gobbledygook, but in Mercedes-Benz terminology CLK55 AMG signifies top performance for serious drivers.\n\nThe fastest production vehicle ever built by Mercedes, the CLK55 is a true supercar in every sense of the word. With the roaring V-8 power of a ’60s muscle car and the stiff suspension of an exotic sports car, the acceleration is wild and the handling absolutely uncanny.\n\nOh, yeah, this compact coupe is fast. Scary fast.\n\nBut the brute force is combined with the subtleties of a brilliant suspension, responsive steering and the most powerful set of brakes I’ve ever experienced.\n\nAll around, an awesome automotive tour de force.\n\nThe test car was black on black leather, a sinister coupe with its no-nonsense image enhanced by low, aggressive styling, 17-inch performance wheels and fat, sticky tires. It’s just too bad you have to break the law to stretch its legs.\n\nWish I could have gotten this beast on a racetrack.\n\nFor those familiar with Benz performance, AMG is the magical monogram of the German giant’s high-performance partner. For three decades, AMG took stock Benzes and turned them into supercars for the street and track. In 1998, Mercedes-Benz (now the major division of DaimlerChrysler) bought the tuner and brought its brilliance in house.\n\nSeveral amazing vehicles have resulted, including the ML55 performance version of the Mercedes’ sport utility vehicle.\n\nHere’s the CLK55 AMG by the numbers: 342 horsepower from a hand-built V-8, a full 69 horsepower more than the stock engine of the CLK430, on which the AMG coupe is based.\n\nThat translates to a 0-60 time of just 4.9 seconds and a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph.\n\nNo, I didn’t try that out.\n\nPower is fed through a five-speed automatic equipped with Touch Shift for at least a semblance of stick-shift control.\n\nToo bad they didn’t see fit to offer a real stick shift in this very special, limited-production coupe.\n\nAs well as the race-bred engine, AMG, of Affalterbach, Germany, adds such suspension tweaks as high-rate springs, tighter shock valving, thicker stabilizer bars and harder bushings, all of which help the CLK55 maintain its composure on the most challenging curves. The ride is stiff, that’s for sure, but never what you’d call overly harsh.\n\nA superb performance coupe, CLK is also usable as an everyday car. Other than occasional thumps and heaves produced by the stiff suspension, the coupe will totter around town all day, docilely going about its duties as daily commuter or grocery-getter. It’s a stealthy craft, though, constantly poised to pounce, a light blip of the throttle unleashing the beast.\n\nOf course, being a top-end Mercedes, the CLK55 AMG is loaded with interesting technological features, all standard, such as ESP stability control; rain-sensing wipers; Brake Assist, which amplifies brake pressure in a panic stop; Tele Aid convenience and emergency communications system; and a host of other high-tech goodies.\n\nAccommodation in the front seats are good, but unless everybody on board is very, very small, don’t even attempt to use that back seat. It seems a waste that they even bothered to provide what appears to be a well-furnished seating area, with essentially zero legroom and scant headroom compromised by the sloping roofline.\n\nThe 17-inch Michelins provide uncanny grip, though they rumble and thump over rough surfaces, and sound especially harsh on freeway concrete. But the stiff ride and rumbling tires are more than offset by the remarkable handling.\n\nBasically, this car is just too much fun to drive. The engine note under acceleration is a nearly irresistible rumbling howl that evokes high-performance small-block Chevys. It runs like a nicely turned-out hot rod, which it essentially is – German-style.\n\nThe price is lofty but not when you compare it with similar expressions of pure muscle and handling.",

      "expert_review": "In a less-than-persuasive bid to be socially responsible, German automakers (with the exception of Porsche) limit the top speed of their vehicles to 155 mph (250 kilometers per hour). At that — my current velocity in the Mercedes-Benz CLK 63 AMG Cabriolet — 227 feet of chlorophyll-green German countryside streams past every second. In the words of the Bhagavad-Gita, I am become death, destroyer of bugs. The early morning sky is gray, the traffic is light. I have the top down and it’s rather windy in the cockpit. Actually, at a buck-55, it’s like being inside God’s own novelty whistle.\n\nNo question about it. Fast feels good. No matter what else you may think about high-performance automobiles — that they are reprehensible gas guzzlers, that they are compensations for guys who shower with their shorts on — no one can reasonably dispute speed’s pure, gleeful joy. If movement is action, fast feels like you’re accomplishing something. Fast is the kinesthetic equivalent of beautiful.\n\nThe plastic-wrapped hay bales dotting the swales and valleys look like pearls scattered from a broken strand. Hey! Look at that charming German village … never mind. We passed it.\n\nWhile it’s possible to go fast anywhere — a certain Swede in a certain Enzo taught us that — Germany is one of the few places in the world where you can safely and legally maintain a three-digit rate of speed. Just for reference, the highest posted speed limit in the U.S. is 80 mph, recently approved by the Texas Transportation Department for about 400 miles of road in the western part of the state. Go much faster than that and you’ll have the opportunity to sample the corrections department’s many varieties of armadillo-based cuisine.\n\nBecause of the high speeds, the excellent road conditions and — it must be said — the superior skill and courtesy of European drivers, a driving tour of Germany is for passport-holding car guys what the Dublin pub crawl is for jet-setting alcoholics. And yet speed-unlimited stretches of Autobahn are getting fewer and shorter, as traffic densities and Green Party activism continually erode the last Muscle Beach of horsepower. These days, the Autobahn Polizei rely on radar-operated cameras, and if you see a sudden flash out of the corner of your eye, you know you’ve been caught. Try to smile.\n\nHowever, on this stretch, the free-fire zone between Stuttgart and Ulm, I can put my foot down and leave it down. The CLK 63’s chesty V8 sends an oceanic surge through the car as the speedometer chases the peg … 150 kph, 200 kph….\n\nCarmakers find themselves in a peculiar position. Never has there been so great a disconnect between the top speed potential of automobiles and the environment in which they operate. On the American market right now there are 263-hp Hyundais, 400-hp Pontiacs and Cadillacs, and 500-hp Mustangs. Top speed is the outcome of some complex mechanical formulas, involving factors such as horsepower (engine speed times torque), gear ratios and tire size, weight and aerodynamic efficiency. But horsepower is the key ingredient to going fast.\n\nThe question is: Where can buyers use all that horseflesh? The answer: nowhere. So why pay for it? In Hillary’s famous words: Because it’s there.\n\nA case in point is AMG — Mercedes’ in-house performance tuning division — that might as well be called the Ministry of Excess Capacity. For years, the company’s job has been to take mainstream Mercs and stuff their noses with fissile material, mightily reinforce the chassis, suspension and brakes, and turn out the ultimate sleepers: cars with race car performance that don’t look out of place at the Brentwood Whole Foods.\n\nThe CLK 63 AMG Cabriolet, gorgeously provisioned with rich wood veneers, luxury-luggage leather and polished brightwork, follows this recipe exactly. This year, for the first time, AMG is building its own engines from scratch, rather than modifying stock Mercedes engines. The 6.2-liter V8 under the sloping hood is a huge gleaming aluminum reactor armed with a multisyllabic array of engine-building technologies — lightweight and reinforced, closed-deck crankcase, low-friction cylinder linings, lightweight valve train with bucket tappets, variable valve timing and variable intake snorkels. What it adds up to is a big, honking, 475-hp V8 with the free-revving character of a turbocharged four-cylinder. This engine delivers lunging, who-hit-me midrange torque (465 pound-feet at 5,000 rpm) and just keeps pulling to its 7,200 rpm redline (and slightly beyond, to tell the truth). Zero to 62 mph (100 kph) goes by in a godless and raunchy 4.7 seconds.\n\nDownstream of the V8 is Mercedes’ perfect, smarter-than-thou seven-speed automatic transmission and beyond that a rear axle with a sky-high 2.65:1 gear ratio. Put it all together and — free of electronic interventions — this would be a solid 190-mph car.\n\nBut it’s not. Pulling onto the Autobahn from — what else, a gas station — I mat the throttle. A meaty and invisible German hand swats me between the shoulder blades, and the car shudders a little. First gear, second gear … the car goes like the passions of hell are on its tail. In about 30 seconds or so I’m approaching the 155 mph barrier. The car leans into the air. The tires hiss. The twin exhausts cackle with the sound of high-priced premium benzin catalyzed at a rate of a liter per minute. There’s so much engine left to go.\n\nThen the car touches the electronic speed limiter. Suddenly all the tension in the car dissipates with a feeling like detumescence. BBRRRRrrrrrrr … The gearbox jumps into the super-tall seventh gear, the rpm sink back to about 3,700 rpm, and I find myself loafing along — puttering, really — hamstrung by a functional impasse.\n\nNow, I’m still going 155 mph, which if you ask the California Highway Patrol is pretty fast. But I feel as if the car has taken a nap. I’m just cruising, driving with one hand and fiddling with the sound system amid the flying acreage.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Here in the late stages of internal-combustion technology, horsepower is relatively easy to come by. And as long as car buyers use horsepower as a guide to choose good car from bad — more equaling better — carmakers will supply the ponies. But, clearly, there comes a point when more horsepower is pointless vanity, and I wonder if … Never mind. We passed it.\n\n2006 Mercedes CLK 63 AMG Cabriolet\n\nBase price: $84,500 (est.)\n\nPrice, as tested: $92,000 (est.)\n\nPowertrain: DOHC 6.2-liter, 32-valve V8, with variable valve timing and variable intake geometry; seven-speed, three-mode automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\n\nHorsepower: 475 at 6,800 rpm\n\nTorque: 465 pound-feet at 5,000 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 4,150 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 4.7 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 106.9 inches\n\nOverall length: 183.1 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 miles per gallon city, 20 mpg highway (est.)\n\nFinal thoughts: Fast asleep\n\nContact automotive critic Dan Neil at dan.neil@latimes.com.",

      "expert_review": "I used to chuckle at Mercedes-Benz drivers. To me, the sight of the cars either meant a rolling midlife crisis or something comparable to a weekend duffer bringing a $6,000 set of clubs to the public golf course. I mean, do you reallllllly need all that?\n\nNow, after having driven a string of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, I’ve become one of those motorists I used to laugh at. It must be some kind of Mercedes virus — either that, or prolonged exposure to the automaker’s luxury loaded cars prompts a bizarre addiction to the point where you find yourself saying things like, “What, no navigation system in this one? How gauche!”\n\nAt any rate, those who long for Mercedes’ storied engineering happily have many choices — from the merely pricey to the obscenely expensive. Here’s a look at the models I have sampled from the Mercedes lot:\n\n2001 C240 sedan\n\nIt’s a cute little five-passenger model from the C-Class. Oh, and it’s a steal in Mercedes terms with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $29,950.\n\nOh, sure, it has a comparatively humble 2.6-liter V-6 (168 horsepower), but it’s loaded with enough standard goodies to put your American-luxury-car-owning neighbors to shame. Leather seating inserts, wood interior trim, auto-dimming mirrors, stop-on-a-dime four-wheel disc brakes and front/rear crumple zones are just a few of the perks.\n\nThe V-6, by the way, more than handles what the local roadways dish out (sequential multipoint fuel injection helps, of course), and the C240 can be dressed up with various four-figure options to make it a more-worthy road warrior.\n\nEven with the base $29,950 version, you still get top-drawer M-B engineering, and the technicians at the elegant Mercedes-Benz service centers give you the same attention as those drivers bringing in six-figure-priced machines.\n\nPeople prowling for an entry-level Mercedes will have more to cheer about soon as the C-Class Coupe reaches American shores in numbers. That will be a bargain-basement offering among Mercedes vehicles, starting around $26,000.\n\n2001 S55 AMG sedan\n\nTo be precise, it’s a five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase (121.5 inches). But it’s a light year removed from the C240, with the “AMG” designation being the tip-off. AMG is M-B’s high-performance division, and in the S55, that translates to a 5.5-liter V-8 laying down 354 horsepower and 391 pounds/foot of torque (at only 3,000 revolutions per minute).\n\nThe standard package also includes an active suspension, ultra-fancy 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker premium Bose sound system with CD changer, 14-way power-adjustable front seats and a power telescoping steering wheel.\n\nAnd there’s the pleasure of watching a sports-car-driving wacko disappear in your rearview mirrors when you apply the power to your classy looking family sedan.\n\nPlease note, this kind of S-Class pleasure c osts $99,645 on the bottom line. That’s with zero options, a $645 destination/delivery charge and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\n2001 S600 sedan\n\nStill trying to digest that sticker price on the S55? What’s the big deal?\n\nHere’s another S-Class five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase, but with a 362 horsepower V-12 and a navigation system, the sticker price jumps to $115,945.\n\nPutting a right foot deep into an accelerator hooked up to a V-12 is an experience every motorist should experience at least once. It almost makes the drawbacks worth it. Those would be fear of parking within 10 feet of other vehicles, insurance bill terror and an overwhelming urge to rush outside every five minutes to see if anyone has put a ding in your car.\n\nOne other thing: The car has so much on it that it will take you at least three months to master every tech goodie explained in the owner’s manual.\n\n2002 SL500 coupe\n\nHere we g Much more reasonable. This SL-Class coupe/roadster carries two passengers and starts at only $83,800.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. This is a rich person’s toy. You’re 100 percent correct, and what a toy it is! Nothing stirs the automotive journalist’s soul like having momentary possession of a vehicle utterly beyond the reach of his income.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to pay the fare, the SL500 package includes a 302-horsepower V-8, independent damper struts on the front, rain-sensitive windshield wipers, headlight washer/wipers and a security system that does everything but write up an arrest report on the prospective offender.\n\nThrow in an extra $2,500 for a “Silver Arrow Edition” option, and you get amenities such as a bulletproof silver paint job, a six-CD changer and six-spoke wheels so dazzling that sunglasses are mandatory equipment for viewing.\n\n2001 CL600 coupe\n\nThis is the ultimate in the Mercedes-Benz test-model lot. The mother lode. The Holy Grail.\n\nThe four-passenger coupe with a 362 horsepower V-12, the full range of techno goodies and a 600-pages-plus owner’s manual that only those with advanced degrees in automotive engineering will fully understand starts at $117,200.\n\nMy test model was dressed up with perks that included a tire pressure-monitoring system, an electronic trunk closer, “Distronic” adaptive cruise control (which automatically adjusts for distance between vehicles while in cruise control) and AMG-added enhancements that brought the bottom line to $127,895.\n\nTo be honest, the entire time I had this test model I lived in fear of runaway shopping carts and no-look lane changers. Motorists with more money and bravery than I should know that this coupe represents just about the highest level of current automotive evolution.\n\n2001 CLK320 cabriolet\n\nAh, a nice way to finish our tour — a delightful four-passenger droptop with a comparatively easy-to-take MSRP of $48,900.\n\nGetting those two passengers into the back of the CLK320 might be a neat trick, but virtually everything else on this joy ride pleases. Handling for a low-range-priced Mercedes was outstanding. The softtop with a 215 horsepower V-6 held high-speed turns better than the new-for-2002 Lexus SC 430, which starts at $58,455.\n\nGolden State motorists who like to take that dream Big Sur coastal drive on Highway 1 south of Monterey take note: This might be the best car out there for that trip.",

      "expert_review": "Pillarless hardtop.\n\nTo devotees of old cars, that description draws memories of glamorous cars whose mission was to impress with excess.\n\nWhile the cars lacked a pillar aft of the front doors, they were never lacking in eye appeal. With names that evoked far-flung resort areas, the vehicles were coated in chrome and accented in garish colors.\n\nBut hardtops vanished by the early ’70s, killed by the spectre of proposed government rollover standards that never materialized.\n\nLeave it to the stylists at Mercedes-Benz, who know more than a little bit about glamour, to revive this type of coupe in the North American market with the 2003 CLK 320 and CLK 500.\n\nThe look is every bit as beautiful as it was 50 years ago, except this time, Mercedes engineers have given the body enough strength to do without visible pillars between the front and rear doors.\n\nThe CLK 320 uses a 215-horsepower 3.2-liter V-6, while the CLK 500 uses a more powerful 302-horsepower 5-liter V-8. Both motors are hooked to a seamlessly smooth five-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control.\n\nFor testing purposes, the good folks at Mercedes-Benz provided a CLK 320 for testing.\n\nThe V-6 motor is typically German: lots of power on tap once you are under way. It is easy to drive the car smoothly and precisely. Shifts from the five-speed automatic are almost imperceptible.\n\nBraking is excellent, as is foul-weather traction. Mercedes-Benz’s usual portfolio of electronic aids sees to that.\n\nThere is the solid teutonic ride and handling that is expected of a Mercedes-Benz, although it never felt as sporty as a Cadillac CTS or BMW 5-Series.\n\nBut this car’s glamorous styling makes up for it. To call the car glamorous is an understatement, as the subtle exterior color, ”Desert Silver” a $655 option, contrasts smartly with the ”Stone Leather” interior.\n\nThe flowing lines belie the car’s rather small size, measuring in at a short 182.6 inches. That’s the same length as a Chevrolet Cavalier. While the CLK’s rounded headlamps may resemble the mid-size Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the vehicle actually rides on the smaller C-Class platform.\n\nBut the interior furnishings are pure E-Class.\n\nThe leather seating, burl walnut trim and champagne-colored carpets are sumptuous and very inviting. The seats are typically firm in the Mercedes tradition, but seat bolsters are a bit narrow. There’s good room in the front, but rear seat passengers will definitely feel cramped. Seat heaters are optional, surprising, given the car’s over $40,000 base price.\n\nBut other luxuries abound.\n\nSeatbelt presenters hand front seat occupants their seat belts, so they won’t strain their giblets reaching back for them. All mirrors dim automatically. Windshield wipers adjust the speed automatically depending on rainfall intensity. The driver’s seat and steering w heel move out of the way to ease exiting the vehicle.\n\nOther goodies include the cell phone/navigation/audio system combo, complete with screen and many, many buttons. Someday, an automaker will realize that simplicity is as much a luxury as electronic overkill.\n\nIn the meantime, you’ll find the system works well, after you figure it all out. The Bose audio system has excellent sound, although the glovebox-mounted CD changer would skip every time the glovebox door was slammed shut. Slamming was necessary because closing it gently never resulted in a closed glovebox.\n\nThe instrument cluster is quite interesting, with the center of the instrument used for trip information. The needle revolves around this central gauge to indicate speed. It is a design that’s both innovative and appealing.\n\nThe whole car is appealing, at least from a style and technology standpoint.\n\nSadly, the same can’t be said for some annoyances that cropped up during testing. The most worrisome one was an engine that felt as if it were about to stall. It stumbled and lost power at low speeds, just like cars with carburetors used to do on cold mornings.\n\nOther problems included windshield wipers that were so noisy they almost drowned out the excellent Bose audio system and a driver’s side window that made a noise similar to that of fingernails on a chalkboard.\n\nThat’s what made the Mercedes-Benz CLK320 somewhat disappointing: but glamour has its price.",

      "expert_review": "THERE are many things we do not know. We don’t know if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. No one can say if physicists will find the elusive Higgs boson. We can’t be entirely sure what the deal is with John Travolta.\n\nBut we can say a priori that commemorative pace cars are the dorkiest vehicles ever made. Go ahead, check on EBay: There’s a guy selling his black and silver 1978 Corvette with “Official Pace Car” and “62nd Annual Indianapolis 500 Mile Race” on the doors. The most amazing thing? The car has 23,861 miles on it. Driving this car is the road-going equivalent of drinking expired milk.\n\nOf all the accomplishments of the Mercedes-Benz CLK 63 AMG Black Series – if you consider felony murder of tires an accomplishment – the greatest is this: It is the world’s first and only cool pace car for the street. Though, technically, it’s a “safety car”: Excepting the lettering and flashing lights, this car is virtually identical to the Mercedes-supplied vehicles used in Formula One to pace the field during full-course cautions. So, naturally, this car has rennsport out the wazoo.\n\nThe follow-up to last year’s SLK 55 AMG Black Series (not sold in the U.S.), the Black Series CLK is essentially a rich-guy, track-day car in the mold of the Porsche 911 GT3. With a wider and lower stance than the stock CLK AMG, the Black Series has bodywork that looks like it’s about to have a steroid-induced aneurysm.\n\nThe bulging carbon-composite fender flares shroud gorgeous 19-inch forged alloy wheels slathered in racing tires (Pirelli P Zero Corsas, 265/30YR19s in front and 285/30YR19s in the rear). Spectacular Deco-like strakes stream back from the front wheel wells. A massive front spoiler skims the road ahead, providing ventilation for an oversized radiator and brake ducts. The carbon-fiber valance at the rear hosts the polished steel quad exhausts and a differential-dedicated heat exchanger. Thus raked with aero mods, the CLK presents a brooding, hungry, wolfish face to the world. Toothsome, with special emphasis on “tooth.”\n\nUnder the hood, the 6.2-liter V8 has been given a larger megaphone with remapped throttle control, bigger induction plumbing and freer-flowing exhaust, all of which raises the Black Series’ output to a nice, round – and quite bonkers – 500 hp at 6,800 rpm, 25 hp more excessive than the CLK 63 AMG Cabrio. Max torque is 465 pound-feet at 5,250 rpm. As appropriate for something called Black Series, the sound of this engine at start-up is dark and chthonic rumble quite unlike the fiery cough of a highly stressed Ferrari, for example. The odd thing is, even though this engine is parsecs distant from an old Winston Cup V8, the furious, crazed cackling overrun you hear on corner entry sounds just like a vintage stocker. Ummm good.\n\nThese surreal amounts of twist and spin go through the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission answering to shift paddles attached to the new racing-style flat-bottom steering wheel. This spectacular gearbox responds precisely as vividly as you drive it. Click through mid-rpm upshifts on the highway and the car accelerates with a gliding perfection that wouldn’t spill the morning coffee. But spin up the rpm and the gearbox cracks off shifts with back-shoving authority that Porsche’s Tiptronic might recognize. In manual mode, the gearbox will not automatically upshift so you can hold the car near redline and balance it with the throttle in a corner (the tranny’s computer also blips the throttle for you on downshifts). Some might wish for a proper manual transmission but I can’t see how that makes the car better.\n\nOr faster. Mercedes estimates this car will storm from a dead stop to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds and 120 mph in 12 seconds. Yep, that sounds about right. To achieve these crazy numbers in this 3,948-pound car, you need only line it up on an appropriate parcel of asphalt – preferably outside U.S. territorial waters – and stand on it. The remapped traction control negotiates the union of rubber and road. The car barely squats at launch, gives a little wiggle sideways and then … wait, wasn’t there just a car here?\n\nI have no idea what’s going on with the nub of a shifter in the console, though. It looks like an aluminum bone that’s been chewed.\n\nFor the CLK 63 Black Series’ handling prowess you could credit many things. The car has special coil-over suspension, adjustable for ride height, bump and rebound, as well as toe and camber (I assume my test car had the out-of-the-box settings, which were near perfect). This suspension is stiffer than, well, never mind what it’s stiffer than. Stiff, OK? The car has mega brakes, 360-mm ventilated ceramic front discs with six-piston calipers. The forged alloy wheels are feather light, a mere 24.3 pounds apiece, and this summary improvement in unsprung weight adds a huge measure of composure and control when the car is traversing less than perfect pavement.\n\nTo me, though, the thing that gives it its athleticism is the chassis development. There are three major transverse reinforcements, including two strut tower bars, front and rear (the latter stretching across the trunk space). Also, because the back seats have been removed, the engineers were able to add a mighty cross-brace across the car’s midpoint. With that, the CLK 63 Black has the girder-stiff feel of a fully caged track car.\n\nWait, the back seats have been removed? Yes, such is the price of a super-performance coupe (that and $135,000).\n\nIs it worth it? Well, the performance is astounding. The car has ridiculous amounts of lateral grip, exquisite transitional manners, fantastic braking and steering as lively and communicative as anything with a Mercedes star. The new multiplate limited-slip differential means you can put the galactic power down earlier and harder in corners. The very sound of the thing would make angels weep 30-weight oil.\n\nIt’s also a very rare bird. Mercedes expects to sell no more than 350 of the cars in the U.S., out of a 700-unit production run. So you’ll be the only one on your block to own one, unless your block is in Holmby Hills. For F1 fanatics, this is absolutely as close as they are going to get to lapping Monza or Hockenheim.\n\nBut Safety Car? I don’t think so.\n\n—\n\n———————————————– dan.neil@latimes.com\n\n2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK 63 AMG Black Series\n\nBase price: $135,000\n\nPrice, as tested: $135,000\n\nPowertrain: Naturally aspirated 6.2-liter DOHC V8 with variable-valve timing and intake geometry; seven-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode; rear-wheel drive with limited-slip differential.\n\nHorsepower: 500 at 6,800 rpm\n\nTorque: 465 pound-feet at 5,250 rpm\n\nRedline: 7,200 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 3,948 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 4.1 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 106.9 inches\n\nOverall length: 183.3 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 13 miles per gallon city, 20 mpg highway.\n\nFinal thoughts: A feast of performance, table for two",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSince 2004, the CLK-Class coupe has been tweaked, stiffened and beefed up. The car is sold as a convertible (Cabriolet), or as a coupe. Over the years, the B-pillars have been removed and an automatic soft-top, seven-speed automatic transmission and sensor-controlled roll bars disguised as head restraints have been added.\n\nLast year, the high-performance CLK63 AMG version was only available as a convertible, but for 2008 a CLK63 AMG coupe called the Black Series is also available. The 2008 CLK350 now has a sport suspension and 18-inch wheels as standard equipment. The CLK550 is unchanged.\n\nExterior\nRear windows in the pillar-less coupe retract fully to create an open, airy feeling. Mercedes-Benz’s three-pointed star sits at the center of a low, wide grille. Twin ellipses form a single headlight unit on each side of the grille. The CLK63 AMG features a front air dam and side skirts among other exterior tweaks that set it apart from the standard CLK.\n\nElegance is the CLK350’s front-end theme, while sportiness takes precedence in the CLK550. The CLK63 AMG has a hunkered-down stance with bulging fenders, taking inspiration from Mercedes-Benz’s race cars. For 2008, the CLK350 has 18-inch wheels as standard equipment.\n\nInterior\nEach model holds four occupants on leather-upholstered seats; the rear seat is split and folds. When front occupants close their doors, an arm extends to deliver the seat belt buckle. Vertical LCD bar graphs are used for fuel and coolant-temperature gauges.\n\nStandard equipment includes a Tele Aid emergency assistance system, automatic dual-zone air conditioning with a sun sensor, 10-way power front seats and rain-sensing wipers. A Harman Kardon LOGIC7 system offers seven-channel digital surround sound.\n\nMercedes’ Keyless Go system unlocks and starts the car via buttons on the door handles and gearshift knob, respectively. Additional options include bi-xenon headlights, a navigation system and a Parktronic system that detects obstacles to the rear. There’s also an electronic truck closer that lets you close the trunk with a button inside the cabin or on the trunk itself.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 goes into the CLK350 coupe and Cabriolet, while a 382-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 powers CLK550 models. The CLK63 AMG Cabriolet holds a 475-hp V-8 that makes 465 pounds-feet of torque. The CLK63 Black Series coupe makes 500 hp, and Mercedes-Benz estimates its zero to 60 mph time at 4.1 seconds. All models use a seven-speed automatic transmission. Touch Shift permits manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nCLK-Class models have four side-impact airbags. The front-seat side-impact airbags in Cabriolets provide head and thorax protection. Coupes have full-length side curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Just Add Scenery\n2004 Mercedes-Benz CLK500 Cabriolet\n\nSANTA BARBARA, Calif.\n\nCalifornia driving is often portrayed as an endless traffic jam on U.S. 101. That’s only part of the picture.\n\nThere are other roads free of clutter and blessed with beauty, byways such as California Highway 154, which runs northeast of State Street in this oceanside city.\n\nYou can follow Highway 154 its full length of 32 miles, from Santa Barbara to Los Olivos, taking in the glories of the Los Padres National Forest along the way. Or you can take a relatively short but spirited drive around the highway’s twists and curves, exiting at Stagecoach Road, which leads to pleasant dining on venison and rabbit at the century-old Cold Spring Tavern.\n\nIt is best to drive Highway 154 in a car that allows you to totally enjoy the experience — preferably a convertible that grants you full view of the scenery and intimate contact with the road. You’d do well to choose this week’s test vehicle, the 2004 Mercedes-Benz CLK500 Cabriolet.\n\nIt is a car built for romantic motoring. Thus, it lacks anything that can get in the way of a fantasy drive. The fabric soft top is an example. There is no need to tussle with clamps or levers to unlatch and lower the canopy. Nor is it necessary to climb into the car and push a button to bring the top down.\n\nYou can do all of that standing outside of the car, using Mercedes-Benz’s patented SmartKey. Point the key at the car. Push a button on the electronic key fob. As if by magic, the top unlatches and lowers itself along with the side windows. It is all very neat, clean, fast.\n\nAlso, there is no need to insert the key into the ignition slot to start the car. An optional “Keyless Go” system electronically connects the key to the car in all operational matters — locking, unlocking, and starting the car, as well as lowering and lifting the convertible top.\n\nAntennas embedded in several locations in the car pick up a signal transmitted by the SmartKey. As long as you have the key somewhere on or near your body, you can open the car by touching one of the door handles or the trunk lid.\n\nOnce inside the CLK500 Cabriolet, or its smaller-engine sibling, the CLK320, you can start the car simply by depressing the brake pedal and touching a button atop the five-speed automatic gearshift lever.\n\nOf course, all of this electronic wizardry raises the question of reliability? What happens, for example, if the CLK 500 suffers the automotive equivalent of an East Coast blackout?\n\nWell, you won’t be able to drive anywhere, just as you wouldn’t be able to drive a regular car in which the battery failed. But mechanically redundant systems would allow you to open the door and the trunk, according to Mercedes-Benz engineers.\n\nSpeaking of which, if you lock the car and, as I have done on several occasions, accide ntally drop the keys in the trunk and then close the lid, you are not at a loss. The key “knows” it’s in the wrong place and automatically pops the trunk open after a few seconds.\n\nBut more exciting than all of that is the driving. Like most car companies, especially those competing at the high end, Mercedes-Benz has increased the body rigidity of its newest models, imbuing them with substantially improved handling in the process. That is the case with the CLK500, which Mercedes-Benz engineers say is 10 percent stiffer than its now-discontinued predecessor, the CLK430.\n\nThe new car packs a 5-liter, 302-horsepower V-8 engine, a four-wheel independent suspension system, and a variety of stability and traction control systems to help keep you safe along the ridges and mountainsides of Highway 154.\n\nThe car also allows you to take in that scenery with an environmentally guilt-free conscience. Though it is big of engine, it is quite small on tailpipe pol ution, easily qualifying for California’s ULEV (ultra-low-emissions vehicle) rating. And it is devoid of macho, performance-car exhaust-note noises that do nothing but frighten wildlife.\n\nThis, my friends, is a car for lovers of all things beautiful.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaint: The CLK500 could use more low-end torque. I wanted more oomph in moving from a stop. Mercedes-Benz says it will offer a 2004-model limited-edition CLK 55 AMG performance version of the car in which there will be torque aplenty.\n\nPraise: The test car felt light, tight and especially right on narrow mountainside passes. I also was impressed with its ability to dance lightly over bad roads.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The car attracts so much favorable attention, especially with the top down, it makes the driver feel beautiful. The car is endowed with shapely, sexy, seductive lines.\n\nBody style/layout: All CLK models — 320, 500, and 55 AMG — are front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door convertibles with fully automatic tops.\n\nEngines/transmissions: The tested CLK500 Cabriolet has a 5-liter V-8 that develops 302 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 339 foot-pounds of torque between 2,700 and 4,250 rpm.\n\nCapacities: The car seats four adults. Trunk volume is 8.6 cubic feet with the top up and 5.4 with the top down. The fuel tank holds 16.4 gallons; premium unleaded gasoline is recommended.\n\nMileage: I averaged 25 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving at mostly legal speed.\n\nSafety: Automatic anti-rollover protection system, side air bags, multiple electronic traction and stability control and brake assistance systems.\n\nPrice: Pricing is unsettled at this writing. Estimated base price will be $59,850. Estimated dealer’s invoice is $56,000. Transportation charge is $720. Estimated price as tested is $60,570.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Cadillac XLR, BMW M-3.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new high-performance model from Mercedes-Benzs AMG performance division has joined the CLK-Class lineup. Like the equivalent coupe thats been on sale, the new CLK55 AMG Cabriolet carries a handbuilt, 342-horsepower V-8 engine and rides a special AMG suspension.\n\nOnly 1,400 CLK55 AMG Cabriolets will be produced in its single-year life cycle, and they will be priced at $79,645 (including the destination charge). As a comparison, the CLK430 Cabriolet stickers for $57,945. The sticker price for the CLK55 AMG coupe is $69,095, which is $18,200 higher than the price of the CLK430 coupe.\n\nMercedes-Benz says both AMG models promise supercar performance. In addition to the hot V-8, both CLK55 AMG models feature aero body trim, a sport suspension and 17-inch wheels. Convertibles have a power top with a glass rear window.\n\nAs for the regular CLK-Class models, a Sport Package is newly available for the CLK320; this package features AMC aerodynamic bodywork and 17-inch tires. New five-spoke alloy wheels go on the CLK430 models.\n\nDerived from the prior-generation C-Class midsize sedan, the rear-wheel-drive two-door CLK-Class coupes and Cabriolet convertibles display a more curvaceous profile. The CLK320 has a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 engine, while the CLK430 is powered by a 275-hp, 4.3-liter V-8. The two standard models compete against the BMW 3 Series, Lexus SC 430 and Volvo C70. Mercedes-Benz sold 19,423 CLK-Class models during 2001, down from 17,796 units in 2000, according to Automotive News.\n\nExterior\nThe styling of the CLK-Class group is strictly Mercedes-Benz but with more rounded lines than the C-Class sedan features. Oval headlights instead of rectangular units sit within a lower front end that flanks a tapered, classic-look grille. Full body-colored rocker panels are installed on the CLK320 to match the air dams and rear bumpers. Convertibles have an automatically activated roll bar and a power-operated top that includes a glass rear window with a defogger. Except for modified doors on the convertible, the two body styles share little structural features and no body panels behind the A-pillars.\n\nAMG-designed Sport aerodynamic enhancements are installed on CLK430 models. Front and rear fog lights are mounted on all models. Riding a 105.9-inch wheelbase, the CLK-Class models are 180.2 inches long overall. Coupes stand 54 inches tall, vs. 54.3 inches high for the Cabriolet. Seven-spoke alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the CLK320, while 17-inchers equip the CLK430 and CLK55 AMG models.\n\nInterior\nBoth the CLK-Class coupe and convertible are built to provide ample interior space for four occupants on leather-upholstered seats. The front seats have a 10-way power adjustment with drivers seat memory. A split, folding rear seat is installed in the back. Cargo volume is 11 cubic feet in the coupe and 9.4 cubic feet in the Cabriolet, but the latter dips to just 5.7 cubic feet when the roof is down.\n\nOne-touch operation controls the coupes sunroof, and opening the doors drops the side windows by about half an inch to assure the best seal when the doors are closed again. An optional COMAND (Cockpit Management and Data) system controls audio functions, as well as those of the integral satellite-based navigation system and available cellular phone by using a dashboard screen. An Internet-based InfoServices option, available separately, uses the same screen to display news, stock quotes, sports scores, weather reports and other customized information.\n\nStandard equipment includes automatic dual-zone air conditioning, a telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, power windows and door locks, heated power mirrors with memory, a Bose cassette/weather-band stereo with CD changer, tachometer, digital clock, intermittent wipers, a universal garage-door opener and a theft-deterrent system.\n\nAll CLK-Class models have a Tele Aid emergency assistance system with features that include remote door unlocking, alarm notification and remote diagnostics. Tele Aid can summon emergency help by using cellular and satellite-based technology that provides a direct link to the companys roadside assistance program.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree CLK-Class engines are available. A 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 goes into the CLK320, and a 275-hp, 4.3-liter V-8 powers the CLK430. The V-6 is also equipped in the E320 sedan and other Mercedes models, while the 4.3-liter V-8 is used in larger vehicles. The 5.5-liter V-8 in the CLK55 AMG coupe and Cabriolet generates 342 hp and 376 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nAll CLK models have a five-speed-automatic transmission that makes use of Touch Shift for manually controlled gear changes by tipping the gearshift lever to the left or right. Mercedes-Benz claims the new CLK55 AMG Cabriolet can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds and reach 155 mph, while its AMG coupe companion performs the 0-to-60-mph dash a full second quicker, making this the companys fastest production model ever.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, traction control, antilock brakes and Mercedes Electronic Stability Program are standard on all CLK-Class models.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
