      "expert_review": "In a single stroke, the Mercedes-Benz ML320 has changed the face of sport-utility vehicles. Not only is its $33,950 base price extremely competitive, but it also excels in both off- and on-road driving.\n\nThat’s a tricky compromise to strike. Normally, if an SUV is truly adept off-road, then its on-pavement ride is tortuous; if it rides smoothly on the road then its off-road skills suffer. Mercedes-Benz, however, has created an all-new vehicle that does both well. It is built exclusively in a new factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nKey ingredients for its brush bashing prowess are the double-wishbone suspension and the electronic traction control system (4ETS). 4ETS is a full-time four-wheel-drive system that splits power 50/50 front-to-rear under normal driving. When the wheel sensors detect slippage braking is applied to the spinning wheel and power is transferred to the wheel or wheels with traction. Even with only one tire in solid contact with the ground the ML320 can pull itself forward. A low range gives it one of the slowest crawl speeds in the industry, according to Mercedes.\n\nThis electronic system turns the ML320 into a mountain goat capable of traversing a slippery slope as casually as most SUVs negotiate a fast-food drive-through. Last summer, during the vehicle’s press introduction, Mercedes-Benz created a challenging off-road course that included offset dirt mounds that lifted two wheels off the ground at once. Normally, conquering this kind of obstacle would require three locking differentials, but 4ETS enabled the ML320 to crawl over without hesitation. The lack of locking differentials improves on-pavement behavior.\n\nPower comes from an aluminum 3.2-liter V6 with 215 horsepower. A balance shaft that cancels vibrations sits within the heart of the engine block. This engine has three valves per cylinder–two intake and one exhaust. Two spark plugs for each cylinder allow for more complete combustion and lower emissions. Mercedes recently announced that the ML320 passes all California emission regulations (the most strict), meets federal NLEV (National Low Emission Vehicle) standards and performs at Super-Ultra-Low-Emission-Vehicle (S-ULEV) levels better than many passenger cars.\n\nFuel economy is rated at 17 mpg city and 21 highway.\n\nA five-speed automatic transmission is the only one offered, but its gated shifter can be manipulated quite effectively for those who like to exercise more control over its shifting.\n\nHauling around more than 4,200 pounds is no easy task for an engine this size, but it seems more than up to the task. Stand on the throttle and the engine generates a satisfying surge. Out on the highway it settles into an easy gait that is deceivingly fast, thanks to the smooth ride and car-like handling.\n\nCrank the wheel into a turn and the ML takes it like a sedan. It does not pitch or wobble like so many top-heavy SUVs do. Small bumps and cracks in the pavement are transferred into the body by the tires, but the actual ride is very nearly as supple as any Mercedes four-door.\n\nThe 111-inch wheelbase is roughly the same as a Ford Explorer and 5.1 inches longer than a Jeep Grand Cherokee. With the seats down total cargo space is 85.4 cu. ft., versus 81.6 cu. ft. for the Explorer and 79.3 cu.ft. for the Grand Cherokee. A longer cargo area would have inhibited off-road use.\n\nSlip inside the tall cabin and you will find the surroundings typical Mercedes-Benz. Instrumentation is simple without being plain, auxiliary controls have a precise feel and the steering wheel is large. There are front and side airbags for both driver and passenger. The front seats have fairly flat bottoms and are separated by a large central console that contains buttons for power windows, locks and mirrors. Putting these buttons in the central console makes it easier to produce right-hand-drive versions for export, but I still prefer window and lock buttons on the doors.\n\nCupholders that pivot outward are built into each end of the dash.\n\nOur test vehicle was equipped with the M1 package ($2,950) of leather-trimmed, heated, eight-way power seats, Walnut trim on dash and console, trip computer, privacy glass and lockable safe box under the passenger seat. Very cozy. The woodgrain trim on the door handles, however, doesn’t match the real wood on the dash and console.\n\nThe three-section back seat slides forward to expand the luggage space, or to put kids riding in child safety seats closer to those in front. If you have two kids in back, the center section can fold down between them like a table. Having three sections gives more options for hauling configurations, but folding down the seat is more complicated than necessary. Getting a completely flat load floor requires considerable tugging to move the whole seat forward and down. A third-seat may be optional in the future, which explains the seat design.\n\nNext fall, a second M-Class will be offered with a 268-horsepower V8. Designated ML430, it will also have 17-inch wheels and a top track speed of 130 mph. Price will be under $45,000.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $33,950. Options included the M1 package, power glass sunroof and metallic paint, which brought the sticker price to $39,065.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: A luxury SUV that takes corners like a car and slogs through rough stuff with equal aplomb is quite an accomplishment. The four-wheel-drive system is superb in all but the most hairy off-road situation.\n\nCounterpoint: The tri-folding back seat is handy but overly complicated.\n\nWoodgrain trim around the door handles doesn’t match the walnut on the console.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 111 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,200 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $33,950\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $39,065\n\nMPG RATING: 17 city, 21 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "If it strikes you that the Ford Explorer and Jeep Cherokee seem to be the sport-utes of choice for the everyday, backwards-baseball-cap-wearing masses, take heart.\n\nThe 1999 Mercedes-Benz ML430, the second model in the company’s M-Class line, lends a hefty dose of status to the SUV market. It’s as if Tiffany or Escada got into off-roading. The base price is even somewhat reasonable – $43,750 before adding such options as the $1,050 Bose premium audio system and the $1,095 glass sunroof But we found in some respects the ML430 does not live up to the storied Mercedes brand name.\n\nShe: You’ve heard of trophy wives and trophy kids. They make other people jealous because they’re beautiful and make you look so successful. Well, the ML430 is the perfect trophy truck. If status and brand name are important to you, this is the sport-utility you want. If you can afford it.\n\nHe: How come nobody ever talks about trophy husbands?\n\nShe: That would be like talking about magic elves. They don’t exist.\n\nHe: OK, hold that thought until our next visit to the trophy marriage counselor. You were talking about status and brand name. Mercedes has both in spades. Unfortunately, the ML430 doesn’t adequately back up either quality. For about $10,000 less, the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the 4.7-liter V-8 is a much better value – and a better vehicle. If you want even more comfort, check out the Lexus RX300. For sheer status, you can spend $56,000 on a Lexus LX470 or $58,000 on a Range Rover. Or wait until BMW rolls out the new X5 early next year for around $50,000.\n\nShe: You’re just confusing the issue with all that. The bottom line is that Mercedes has a weightier name than all those brands you just mentioned. Wouldn’t you agree?\n\nHe: I’m not arguing the cachet of the three-pointed star. I guess I’m just a little disappointed that the ML430 wasn’t a better vehicle. I had a number of problems, beginning with the very disturbing tendency of the steering not to return to center after you turn a sharp corner. I almost drove up on someone’s lawn the first time that happened. And I still don’t understand why the seats in the ML feel so thin and underpadded.\n\nShe: I guess you never tried on a couture suit. They’re not made for comfort, they’re made for status. Which probably also gives you some idea why Mercedes has not made a minivan. But you have to give the company credit for being practical in some areas. They really paid attention to safety with the ML430, which I think is a huge issue for women shopping the sport-ute market. They’re not just superficially looking for logos. So I think they’ll like the side air bags, the traction control and the standard BabySmart seat system, which deactivates the front passenger-side air bag when you use a special child seat.\n\nHe: Actually, the new V-8 is pretty nice, too. It’s a single-overhead-cam 4.3-liter unit that makes 268 horsepower and 288 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes bundl es it with a five-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive, so you don”t have to fiddle with any levers or switches to get optimum traction and efficiency.\n\nShe: One point you didn’t bring up is the negative buzz about M-class quality – or lack thereof. They’re working on it at the Alabama plant. But the latest J.D. Power Survey still ranked the M-Class near the bottom of the sport-ute category in terms of initial quality. Among the problems were things like misaligned sunroofs, poorly installed insulation and lousy paint jobs. This is not the kind of thing you want to hear when you are spending $47,000 on a new vehicle.\n\nHe: Funny, weren’t you mentioning Mercedes and Escada in the same breath? And does the brand still maintain its lofty status if the quality is questionable? I think the ML430 falls short in other ways, too. Ride quality is nowhere close to that of a Range Rover or even a Grand Cherokee. And if you have long legs, forget about finding a rtable position in the rear seat. So exactly what are you getting for that $47,000? A great engine and a three-pointed star?\n\nShe: You are getting envious looks from other people at the country club. And you won’t get that in your Grand Cherokee.\n\n1999 Mercedes-Benz ML430\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: acceptable\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger sport-utility vehicle.\n\nPrice: Base, $43,750; as tested, $46,965 (inc. $595 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V-8; 268-hp at 5500 rpm; 288 lb-ft torque at 4500 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/18 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,963 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Vance, Alabama.\n\nWhat we liked: The perfect trophy truck; classic looks won’t go out of style; high seating position enhances visibility, feeling of security; powerful V-8; key safety features like side air bags, traction control and BabySmart seat.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Power steering didn’t want to return to center after turning; seats felt too thin; limited legroom in rear seats; pricey at $47,000; mediocre fuel economy; why doesn’t Mercedes-Benz make a minivan?

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz caught the world’s luxury automakers flat-footed when the ML320 first appeared on the scene in 1997.\n\nThe vaunted Mercedes selling a passenger truck? Unheard of!\n\nThe M-Class, arguably the first luxury sport utility behind Range Rover, was an immediate hit, kicking off a whole range of midsize SUVs with high-end appeal.\n\nBut success was fleeting when the M-Class racked up a dismal record for reliability. That was surprising because the basic mechanicals came from the durable E-Class sedans and the SUV was built in a brand-new Alabama plant.\n\nThe problems set off a sales slump for Mercedes, which the company has overcome in recent years along with bringing vast improvements in the M-Class’ repair record.\n\nThe M-Class is new for 2006, redesigned with a sporty flair that was lacking in the original boxy design, which some said looked too much like a minivan. There also has been significant improvement in drivability, with more stable handling and steering that feels lively instead of dull, an issue in the previous ML.\n\nIn all driving conditions, from highway cruising to trail hopping, the ML has the kind of rock-solid feel that characterizes the German automaker’s vehicles, often described as “vaultlike.” The interior also feels rugged and substantial.\n\nThe SUV tested here was the least expensive of the M-Class, an ML350, powered by a V-6 engine and base-priced at less than $40,000. But watch out for those options, which are expensive and quickly add up, pushing the tester perilously close to $50,000.\n\n– – –\n\nThe lowdown\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 3.5-liter V-6 is muscular and refined, befitting the ML350’s sophisticated aura. With 268 horsepower on tap, one might ponder the need for the pricey, V-8-powered ML500 or the new AMG hot rod, ML63.\n\nAll the engines require premium, and the V-6 gets 16 city and 20 highway, not great but not horrible.\n\nThe ML350 comes with Benz’s new seven-speed automatic transmission, which is unobtrusive and responsive. Why seven speeds, you might well ask? Better fuel mileage and improved engine performance because it keeps the motor running in its sweet spot on the rpm range.\n\nStill, it reminds me of the comedy film Spinal Tap and the band’s amps that turned up to 11. Say the next line in a fake English accent: “But we got seven . . . “\n\nDRIVABILITY: With a plethora of electronic enhancements to prevent skids, wheel spin and brake issues, the ML350 drives with remarkable precision. Body sway is controlled; the steering feels right on the money, and maneuverability is responsive.\n\nSTYLING: The new chiseled look with its sharply canted rear follows the trend in this class of SUVs but looks distinctive and unmistakably a Mercedes.\n\nINTERIOR: Every feature, option and safety enhancement known to modern man, and then some, are included or available in the ML320. One thing missing is an optional third row of seating, made difficult by the SUVs new rear dimensions.\n\nThe cabin is attractively durable looking, in Mercedes’ fashion, with plenty of space for regulation-size humans in all seating positions. The seats are especially comfortable.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Highly improved and now with a decent record for reliability, the M-Class continues as one of the premium class acts in the SUV world.\n\n– – –\n\nRELATED\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sport utility, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 3.5 liter V-6, 268 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 258 pound-feet of torque at 2,400 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Seven-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 114.7 inches.\n\nOverall length: 188.5 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,623 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 5,000 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 16 city, 20 highway.\n\nHighs: Refined drivability, engine power, new styling.\n\nLows: Pricey options, lingering reliability questions, modest gas mileage.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $39,750.\n\nPrice as tested: $48,825.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Trim package, $2,200.\n\n* Sunroof package, $1,390.\n\n* Entertainment package, $1,080.\n\n* Heated front seats, $690.\n\n* Iridium silver paint, $690.\n\n* Sirius satellite radio, $500.\n\n* Trailer hitch, $490.\n\n* Power folding mirrors, $75.\n\n* Shipping, $729.\n\nFor more on the Mercedes-Benz ML350, go to autos.azcentral.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benzs conventionally styled luxury sport utility vehicle gained a larger 3.7-liter V-6 engine midway through the 2003 model year, which prompted the automaker to change the designation of the ML320 model to ML350. For 2004, a DVD-based navigation system is a factory option for the ML350; it is priced under $1,000 and comes as standard equipment on the ML500. An Inspiration Edition remains available until late fall of 2003, but the high-performance ML55 AMG model has been dropped.\n\nBuilt in Alabama, the ML350 carries a 232-horsepower V-6 engine, while the ML500 packs a 288-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. Both models have permanently engaged four-wheel drive with a Low range. The five-speed-automatic transmission features Touch Shift manual-gear selection. Traction control works when going downhill and while accelerating. Mercedes-Benzs Tele Aid emergency communication system can summon help or track a stolen vehicle. M-Class competitors include the Acura MDX, Ford Explorer and redesigned Lexus RX 330. The German automaker also offers the utilitarian-looking and more expensive G-Class SUV.\n\nExterior\nMeasuring an inch shorter than the BMW X5 and 3.6 inches shorter than the RX 330, the four-door M-Class is 182.6 inches long overall and rides on a 111-inch wheelbase. At 71.7 inches tall, the M-Class is 5.6 inches taller than the RX 330. M-Class models have a one-piece liftgate at the rear and 17-inch tires. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and a power sunroof are available.\n\nInterior\nThe M-Class seats five people on front buckets and a three-place split rear seat that folds to expand cargo space to 81.2 cubic feet. An optional two-place third-row seat increases passenger capacity to seven. Leather upholstery is standard in the ML500 and optional in the ML350. The traditional Mercedes dashboard layout is augmented by a 5-inch LCD display with touch controls in the center console that operate the climate, audio and telephone functions. This feature also controls the GPS-based navigation system thats standard in the ML500.\n\nOptions include a Parktronic rear-obstacle detection system. Several special designo option groups that combine metallic paint, two-tone Nappa leather upholstery and Poplar wood trim for the interior have also been available. In addition to the seats, designo Nappa leather covers the door pulls, door panels, front central armrest, gear lever and steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe ML350 carries a 232-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 engine, while the ML500 comes with a 288-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. Both models use a five-speed-automatic transmission with a manual shift gate. The permanently engaged four-wheel-drive system has a Low-range gear setting, and it distributes power among the four wheels as needed to maintain traction. Unlike its X5 and RX 330 rivals, Mercedes insists that the M-Class is a true offroad vehicle.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front and rear seats, and side curtain-type airbags are standard. The companys Tele Aid emergency communication system can summon help, and it kicks in automatically to call Mercedes roadside assistance center if an airbag deploys. The system can also be used to track a stolen vehicle. Standard enhanced traction control works while accelerating and when going downhill or uphill.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Old speedsters sputtered and chugged across the dew-covered grass, gasoline fumes broke the crispness of the autumn air. The 1910 Pullman had just pulled onto the grounds of the Radnor Hunt, site of the 4th annual Concours d’Elegance.\n\nNext, it was the Bugatti’s turn, joining two others that had shown up that morning. It was enough to make any car lover smile, even automotive historian Beverly Rae Kimes. “You can never have too many Bugattis,” she quipped.\n\nBugattis are now just revered relics of a glorious motoring past, one this show celebrates. But if there’s any combination of letters that sets modern enthusiasts’ hearts aflutter, it’s AMG, the performance arm of Mercedes Benz. Those letters mean blitzkrieg-like power and handling and for the first time, the folks in the land of the three-pointed star give the M-Class a hefty dose of vitamins.\n\nWith such a wonderful vehicle at my disposal, what better way to spend it than at the Radnor Hunt Concours d’Elegance? Although the timing was strictly accidental, it seemed fortuitous to have this sport-tuned SUV in time to roam the rolling hills of Chester County.\n\nThis was accommodated courtesy of a distance rally held in conjunction with the show. It was really just a long drive, not a race. A sheet of cryptic directions tells you where to drive. Your mission is to do it correctly.\n\nThe instructions usually go something like “Turn left at the right arrow.” My navigator and I took in 72 miles of disgustingly breathtaking horse farms, covered bridges and lots of stone and brick farm houses.\n\nThe Mercedes Benz ML55 seemed to be the perfect companion to escort us through fox-hunting country.\n\nAlthough the ML is available as the 320 (with a 215 horsepower 3.2-liter V-6) and as the 430 (with a more powerful 268 horsepower 4.3-liter V-8) it’s the ML55 (with its 342 horsepower 5.5-liter V-8) that makes a long drive in the country palatable. When you need to turn around, the ML55, being an SUV, can do it, even if you have to go off-road.\n\nNavigating the narrow 18th-century roads, the ML55 proved up to the challenge, taking the turns, dips and corners with ease. Since this was not a timed rally, it was easy to take in the sights and enjoy the challenge of the back roads.\n\nAlthough the all-aluminum engine is capable of speeds of over 150 mph, on this drive it just provided a pleasant amount of grunt. AMG modifies the 5-liter overhead-cam V-8 through increased displacement. It was done by modifying the engine’s crankshaft, allowing for greater stroke of each piston. The manifold was modified and electronics changed, all with the intention of increasing power. This ML pulls very strongly, with a smooth, surly growl to remind the driver that this is no ordinary truck.\n\nA five-speed automatic obediently clicks off the shifts, although manual shifting via a side-to-side activated shifter is standard. It’s not needed however, as the autobox does a good job of reading the driver’s intentions.\n\nThe fully independent suspension, unusual in this class, did a good job of insulating passengers from road shocks. The full-time four-wheel-drive system provides a 50/50 torque split and makes sure that this SUV stays on track. Combined with the traction control system, grip is exceptional for a sports truck, even in damp weather.\n\nThe AMG comes with outrageous 285/50R18 tires and special 5-spoke wheels housed under bulging fenders. Red brake calipers are visible through the wheels and they do an excellent job of stopping the vehicle. But pedal action was disappointing, with a soft feel that hindered the otherwise smooth operation.\n\nThe other disappointment was the amount of wind noise at highway speed, making it noisier than one would expect.\n\nBut after taking roads and matching speeds with Porsches, it was easy to see how this truck seemed appropriate to drive to such an exquisite, low-key show. Th e Radnor Hunt Concours was extremely successful this year, having a good turnout and perfect weather in addition to a stunning field of rare cars. The 1947 Franay-bodied Bentley Mark VI Convertible was exquisite to view. Ditto the flawless 1930 Packard 745 Derham Roadster and an awesome 1934 Riley Imp. The mouth-watering black 1958 MGA Roadster stuck in my mind. Equally hard to forget was the 1927 Bugatti Type 35C. It won the Grand Prix of Barcelona and was hidden during the Spanish Civil War, only to be rediscovered in 1962. With an exposed running gear in the cramped cockpit, this car’s patina would be tough to replicate.\n\nThe show this year spotlighted DuPont, a rare luxury marque that was manufactured through the early 30s. Everett DuPont was on hand, having driven his DuPont LeMans Speedster over 30 miles to the show. This is one collector who likes to drive his cars. Although proud of the car’s heritage he does make one admission. “It’s a chore to drive,” he said reluctantly.\n\nThat’s one thing that can’t be said of the ML55, especially inside. In true M-B fashion, the cabin gets the typical full-lux treatment. Leather and smoked wood trim afford the truck a unique feel, especially given the black interior of the test vehicle.\n\nThe dash has unique black-on-white gauges trimmed in chrome. The stereo, phone pad and GPS system are all integrated into one unit. To get at the otherwise excellent audio system’s cassette or CD slots, one must push a button and wait for the GPS/audio screen to lower. How long will this unit last?\n\nThe dash was easy to figure out, if you’re familiar with Mercedes Benz vehicles. Two minor appointments seemed glaring in their absence: The tilt wheel had to be adjusted manually, as did the climate control. Surprising given the sticker price.\n\nBut this vehicle was an extremely safe one. Front and side airbags are standard, as are anti-lock four-wheel-disc brakes. This is in addition to traditional safety systems such as the Mercedes Benz Baby Smart system, which detects the presence of a child seat up front and deactivates the airbag.\n\nSo this vehicle could be the one vehicle that does it all, with comfort, off-road agility and on-road performance, a rare combination to be sure. But would it be your only vehicle? It depends. For some, one vehicle is never enough.\n\nBack at the show, collector Ray Carr, with his wife, was looking over an exceptional Jaguar Mark V Drophead. “Wouldn’t you rather just have one car like that rather than 25?” she asked.\n\nCarr’s answer was short and sweet.\n\n“No”\n\nI’d agree.\n\n2000 Mercedes Benz ML55\nEngine: 342 horsepower 5.5 liter V-8 Transmission: 5-speed automatic Wheelbase:111 inches Length: 180.6 inches Width:72.2 inches Curb weight: 4,653 pounds Towing capacity:5,000 pounds Ground clearance:8.4 inches\n\nBase price: $64,900 As tested: $65,545 EPA rating: 14 city, 17 highway Test mileage:15 mpg Fuel type:Premium",

      "expert_review": "This is not where you would expect to encounter a Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThere’s not a Starbucks in sight. No outlet mall featuring fine china and designer duds. No ski chalets or beach houses.\n\nBut here we are: two miles back into the woods, up an icy road (gravel in summer) with water running down it like a sluiceway; across the runoff from an overflowing beaver bog; up a steep hill once used as a loading ramp for freshcut logs; moving gingerly over and around the stumps left by the logging operation.\n\nNo, folks who buy the Mercedes ML430 – or its lighter stablemate, the ML320 – seldom take them offroad. Usually, it’s because such adventures don’t interest them. Sometimes it’s because, while they might be tempted, they don’t realize what they have on their hands.\n\nSo, I’ll say it here. On the highway, the ML430 is very much a Mercedes-Benz, sedanlike in its ride. But take it offroad, and it gets downright truck-like. Stiff, sure, and ground-gripping.\n\nAnd so here we are, where a warming winter sun in the midst of a break in the weather has set ice to melt and, in sparse spots, has burned through the ice to gravel beneath. Sometimes, with its traction control system in full operation, the ML430 has three tires set to spinning, yet a transfer of torque and the electronic application of brakes lets the one useful tire – the one on the gravel – grip and move the car. Unlike a lot of its competitors at this high end of the luxury SUV market, I am learning, the ML430 really is an offroad rig. The gauges in the interior are easy to read, but the navigation system is complicated. And that is remarkable, given the luxury of the DeSigno model I am driving. Its front leather bucket seats (two-tone) are slablike in width for broad comfort, yet outlined with strong side bolsters to keep you in place when the going gets rough or sharp.\n\nIn the second row of seats, there is good room for three adults – and plenty of legroom fore and aft. A third row of seats is optional and would be fine for a couple of children. There is also ample space behind that second row of seats – a feature lacking in several luxury SUVs.\n\nErgonomically, there are things I like and things I don’t like here.\n\nThe gauges are big and easy to read and the grouping of controls for mirrors and windows at the middle of the center console is a nice utilitarian touch. The climate controls, too, are big and easy to understand and use.\n\nThe navigation system, however, is more complicated than it needs to be and controls for the audio system are tiny, sometimes recessed, and far too complex to keep an eye on while driving. The $4,000 DeSigno package – special paint, those two-tone coordinated seats, special wheels – adds to an already impressive lineup of standard features that include leather, power and heated front seats, privacy glass, auto-dimming rearview mirror, wood interior trim, trip computer, and a safe box under the front seat.\n\nStandard safety features inc lude four-wheel antilock brakes, electronic stability control, four-wheel independent suspension and front and side air bags for the front compartment.\n\nIt’s powered by a smooth, quiet 4.3-liter aluminum V-8 that delivers a respectable 275 horsepower. Its adaptive 5-speed automatic shifts well on the highway and, for offroading, offers low-range and a hill descent control that keeps the car creeping at a preset pace down the steeps.\n\nOn the highway, it rides high and slightly stiff, yet the feel is very much sedanlike: smooth and sure. Its tuned suspension allows the ML430 to be maneuvered lane-to-lane even at passing speeds, a needed safety factor considering how SUVs are driven by most people.\n\nOffroad, the rugged body-on-frame construction is evident as the whole car just feels stiffer and wonderfully agile. My only complaint here is – and I discovered this playing around the stumps – that for serious offroad romping it should have a bit more suspension travel. It clunked couple of times when it should have been more absorbing of the terrain.\n\nOf course, this is part of the price you pay for the superb highway ride, and since that’s really where most people will use the ML430, it’s a fair tradeoff.\n\nThis is an SUV meant to compete with the Lincoln Navigator, the Cadillac Escalade, the BMW X5, and the Toyota Land Cruiser. It will run with any of them on the highway and, surprisingly, offroad it’s as good as the Land Cruiser, long the leader in this group when it comes to getting gnarly.\n\nNice touch: The remarkably quiet ride. This is a big, tall box with a big engine. You’d expect more noise when you get it into the wind.\n\nAnnoyance: Sure would be nice to have running boards to get into and out of this rig.",

      "expert_review": "A couple weeks ago, my hairstylist and I got into a discussion about pet peeves. Her No. 1 irritation? People who drive too slowly in the left lane. This opened the door for us to discuss all kinds of vehicular pet peeves. While I certainly get ticked off when people aren’t using the left lane properly, they’re out there in the world and I can’t control what they do. My worst vehicular peeve is what happens inside the car with someone you typically consider a friend or loved one – it’s when they annoyingly transform into a backseat driver.\n\nBack when I went to a media launch of Mercedes’ ML550 SUV with its new engine, I initially had some minor bonding issues with the ML because of a backseat driver. I didn’t realize how much power the ML had, and when I went into the first turn I was going faster than I thought. This made for a crude, brake-filled, wobbly turn. First turn of the day, people – in fact, first turn ever in the ML, but of course my co-driver immediately felt compelled to launch into an explanation about how to take turns, making me want to scream. It took some time to figure out the ML (all while trying to tune out his instructions), but I got better by the end of the drive. Once my turn driving was over, the irritation was history; we switched places and I got to sit back and take in this car’s heavenly interior. (Check out what’s different about this year’s ML500 here.)\n\nLong after the media event, my fear now is that the ML550 has turned me into a pet peeve myself. No, I haven’t engaged in backseat driving, but when the ML arrived at Mother Proof’s Global Headquarters, I pestered my boss endlessly to give it up. I literally grabbed the keys out of her hand, made her take her kids’ car seats out and give it to me (in the freezing cold, after a party she had hosted, no less). I haven’t been so selfish and ornery about anything in recent memory, and I’m sure she is now telling everybody I am her new pet peeve (with good reason).\n\nHappily, I was rewarded for my grubbing. It really says something to me when I wake up in the morning excited to get into a car. That excitement didn’t wane one iota during my test drive. The ML550 I drove had a V-8, meaning it has amazing power that is incredibly responsive and manageable (once you get used to it, of course, and as long as no one’s telling you how to drive). For those of you whose pet peeve is the cost of gas, however, there’s a downside: The ML has a huge gas tank (25.1 gallons), and an even huger thirst that requires premium fuel. This equals $75 a visit at the gas station, which I’d guess is slightly larger than your average pet peeve. I averaged 16 mpg in it, but the plus side is that there’s also an ML320, which is similar to the 550 but has a more efficient diesel engine (18/24 mpg).\n\nNavigation and entertainment systems are usually major pet peeves of mine; navigation systems tend to irritate me, and, well, I still have a hard time with the idea of TV in the car. The ML’s navigation system is predictably tricky to use, but the entertainment system was easy. The one hitch is that the DVD player is under the backseat, practically begging to be placed somewhere more practical. I like that the video screens are mounted in the back of the front headrests, keeping my view out the back and sides clear. Lastly, I like that the entertainment system comes with headphone jacks so you can use your own. I know the wireless headphones that come with other systems are cool, but their larger size and the buttons on the sides make them tricky for younger kids.\n\nA trip to the mountains became the most enjoyable event ever in the ML550. The kids looked out the window until they couldn’t stand waiting for the movie anymore (about 15 minutes), then enjoyed a flick while we headed west. Maybe I should rethink my position on TV in the car. They also had their own cupholders and climate controls. We squeezed in a large – strike that, HUGE – suitcase and two kid-sized ones, a cooler, a couple of backpacks, a grocery sack of food and my husband’s bike, and there was still ample visibility out the back window. The gearshift is on the steering column, which creates lots of extra room on an uncluttered center stack and console. The lined drawers for change or cell phones were blissful. An automatic tailgate made unloading a breeze, not just during a trip to the mountains but on one to the grocery store as well. It eliminated a personal pet peeve of mine that involves jumping up and hoping to reach the handle of the hatch.\n\nWhile I’ve still got a pet peeve about cars that have so many over-the-top, fluffy features, there are several that do make me happy on a day-to-day basis, including ones that contribute to a smoother, safer ride. The adjustable suspension, which allows for a cushier ride, is fabulous, but switch it into Sport mode and the ML is a joy on mountain passes with switchbacks and climbs. Heated butt warmers are always a plus for this girl, and the adaptive headlights were downright awesome while driving on dark hills with no streetlamps. I could see all around me and even managed to avoid a skunk (hallelujah).\n\nAt the end of the day, I had no pet peeves with the ML. Once I ditched that backseat driver, I quickly became one with the ML. Except for the excruciating heartbreak I experienced when I had to give it back, the ML550 was the perfect test drive.\n\n*For more information on the Mercedes-Benz ML550 and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has long been a proponent of diesel engines, and the current Bluetec is so good that its quiet performance and good fuel economy are sure to win over customers.\n\nThis 3.0-liter diesel V-6 is available in the E-class sedan, the M-Class SUV and the R-Class people mover. The ML320 diesel has a base price of $44,455.\n\nMany folks think of diesel engines as loud, sooty and crude, but today’s high-tech diesels are clean, quiet and 20 percent to 40 percent more efficient than gasoline engines. They also emit less carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. With the Bluetec technology, nitrogen oxide is reduced with two additional catalytic converters. Mercedes-Benz says the E320 Bluetec is the cleanest diesel in the world.\n\nCurrently, the engine is not available in California, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont because it doesn’t meet the stricter emission standards of those states.\n\nBluetec is a term you’ll be hearing more and more because Audi and Volkswagen have adopted the technology for their diesels as well. Diesels are so popular in Europe that more than half of all vehicles are so equipped.\n\nThe ML320 CDI is a great example of why diesels make so much sense, especially in a vehicle whose utility requires a boxy profile. The diesel’s fuel economy ratings are 21 city and 27 highway, compared to 17 city and 21 highway for the gasoline engine in the ML350. Those figures give the ML a cruising range of 600 miles on a tank of fuel.\n\nThe ML’s diesel produces 215 horsepower and 398 pound-feet of torque. That’s considerably more torque than the V-8 in the ML500, and it comes at least 1,000 rpm sooner. That makes the diesel a perfect partner for towing or hauling heavy loads.\n\nThe V-6 has four valves per cylinder, dual overhead camshafts and piezo fuel injectors that spray fuel directly into the center of each cylinder. A variable-nozzle turbocharger adds power and a counter-rotating balance shaft reduces vibration. The engine is mated to a seven-speed automatic transmission, and full-throttle acceleration feels stronger than that of the gasoline engine.\n\nEuropean diesels are increasingly available in this country because recent changes in government regulations mandate low-sulfur diesel fuel.\n\nMercedes claims that its diesel is more fuel-efficient than a comparably sized hybrid vehicle. In a cross-country test, the German magazine Auto Bild compared an ML320 diesel and a Lexus RX400h hybrid. The ML used 11 percent less fuel.\n\nAnother advantage of a diesel engine is its ability to burn biodiesel, made from vegetable oils, and biomass-to-liquid diesel fuel. BTL fuel can be made from any biomass, including scrap wood.\n\nThe second-generation ML has a 114.7-inch wheelbase that is 3.7 inches longer than the previous model’s. Overall length is up by 5.9 inches and width is up by 2.8 inches. The new truck sits about a half-inch lower.\n\nThe ML’s ride is smooth without being mushy, yet it is able to handle moderate off-road conditions easily.\n\nThe ML is more refined across the board. The cabin, and especially the instrument panel, looks more like that of a sports sedan than a truck. Large, tubular air vents exit from the top of the center stack. The center console has two large cup holders, integrated grab handles and an armrest with storage.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system combines full-time drive to all four wheels with four-wheel traction control and a low range. Under normal driving conditions, torque is split 50-50 between the front and rear wheels. When conditions demand, torque is transferred to the wheels with the most traction. Antilock brakes, traction control and a vehicle stability program are standard.\n\nThe longer wheelbase results in more interior space. Front legroom has been increased by 2 inches, while rear-passenger legroom is up by 1.3 inches.\n\nThe split-folding rear seat flips forward without requiring removal of the rear-seat headrests. Total cargo space is 72.4 cubic feet with the seat down. The cargo area is finished with nice carpet. A power liftgate is optional.\n\nPrice The base price of the test car was $44,455. Options on the test car included leather seats, six-disc CD changer, rear parking sensors, metallic paint and the premium package that includes the navigation system with backup camera. The sticker price was $57,375.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "It appears that all that was needed to spice up the stew that is today’s bubbling world of SUVs was a dash of Cayenne.\n\nThat’s the name of the long-awaited, high-performance SUV from Porsche that should debut sometime this year. Rumors of sleek design and thundering power swirl around its anticipated unveiling.\n\nMeanwhile, the folks whose SUV sales may be most directly affected by the Cayenne – BMW and Mercedes-Benz – are already reacting.\n\nIf Mark Twain were alive to write car reviews, he might call this one “The leapfrogging SUVs of Calaveras County.” That’s because, in their drive to claim the high ground of power before the debut of the Cayenne, the BMW X5 and the Mercedes M Class SUVs have been jumping over each other.\n\nMercedes, whose ML 430 was slower and less powerful than BMW’s X5 4.4i, performed a midcycle overhaul of the 430 and redubbed it the ML 500. Where the 430 delivered 268 horsepower to the 4.4i’s 282, the 500 leaped over it with a bigger bore V-8 that delivers 302 horsepower. That’s the car we tested here, and the increase in oomph is noticeable. Of course, we can now leapfrog the ML 500 with the latest BMW X5, the X5 4.6is, and its 340 horsepower (but that’s a subject for next week’s review).\n\nWith the Cayenne looming on the high-performance horizon, it’s fair to ask whether any of these are really SUVs anymore considering that, though they are capable offroad vehicles, the suspensions, wheels, tires, and other design characteristics needed to handle high onroad speeds don’t lend themselves to serious offroad bashing.\n\nEven the look of the ML 500, for instance, says speed more than it does rugged utility. Its new front bumper molds to the body, droops low, and houses the fog lamps. Clear, bi-xenon headlights sit above the bumper and below the sloping, aerodynamic nose and hood (no rectangular, challenging snout here). As upfront, the rear bumper is integrated with the body and does not have the rugged look of a true offroad bumper.\n\nInside, standard Mercedes-Benz luxury abounds. The seats are leather and heated, with eight-way power adjustments upfront. The trim is leather and burl walnut. There are even five cupholders, a very un-Teutonic touch. Also standard are a roof rack, lockable safebox, and trip computer.\n\nStandard safety features include four-wheel traction control, brake assist, a downhill traction system, dual stage front air bags, front and rear side air bags, and front and rear side window air bags.\n\nFrom a base price of about $45,000, options such as special silver paint ($495), a power sunroof with power rear quarter windows ($1,295), memory for the power front seats, rain sensors and power folding mirrors ($800), and an upgraded sound system ($1,200) push you toward $50,000.\n\nAs with any vehicle that might get both highway and offroad use, Mercedes-Benz had to compromise on the suspension of the ML 500. This one has fully independent suspension with double wishbones and swaybars front and rear, while the front gets a torsion bar/spring setup, and the rear gets coil springs and gas pressure dampers.\n\nThe result is a butter soft glide on the highway (which I suspect most folks who buy this car will want). It moved gracefully, at high commuter speeds on the highway. On lesser, winding roads, it had a tendency to lean heavily in hard, fast cornering. It was also soft in offroad tests where stiffer suspension would have limited the bouncing – side-to-side, and front-to-rear, and-rear-to-front – that occurred in heavy bumps.\n\nThe full-time four-wheel drive system is aided by an electronic stability program that uses engine torque and braking to control wheel spin. It is possible for three wheels to be slipping while one moves the car forward.\n\nA hill descent control, activated by a button on the dash, is a wonderful feature. While few ML 500s will be taken offroad, where the descent control is a real treat, the featurewill prove invaluabl to those with steep, slippery driveways at home or at their ski houses, or on those times when they are caught in a storm in hilly country.\n\nSince power was part of the goal in this midcycle revamp, I give the ML 500 credit for the horsepower boost. It is particularly noticeable in a flat torque band that provides seamless power between around 2,800 rpms and up to about 4,300 rpms. That’s good power for passing or for hauling a car full of people and heavy vacation gear. The five-speed automatic transmission handled the extra power with barely noticeable shifts, though I did sense a slight lag in acceleration when the throttle was pushed hard.\n\nOf course, if real screaming power is what you want, there is always the option so common to Mercedes-Benz models. You can turn to the folks at AMG and opt for the ML55 AMG, with its 355 horsepower.\n\nThat would leapfrog you right over the BMW 4.6is and its paltry 340 ponies.\n\n2002 Mercedes ML 500\n\nBase price: $44,950\n\nPrice as tested: $49,385\n\nHorsepower: 302\n\nTorque: 339 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 113.6 inches\n\nOverall length: 196.6 inches\n\nWidth: 73.1 inches\n\nHeight: 55.0 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,070 lbs.\n\nSeating: 5 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 16.2 miles per gallon\n\nSOURCE: Daimler-Chrysler Corp.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch\n\nThe two-foot option for low-range travel. It lets you play serious offroader by applying the brakes even as you depress the throttle, a common trick for power and control in delicate offroad situations.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nI’d like to see more aggressive seats — a bit firmer, better bolstered — in a car that wants to make a high-performance statement.",

      "expert_review": "With the 2012 M-Class, Mercedes brings the comfortable, luxurious driving experience of its flagship S-Class sedan to its most popular SUV.\n\nIf you don’t like to be disturbed by the world around you when you drive, this redesigned luxury SUV is for you.\n\nWe tested the ML350 Bluetec, which is powered by a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel engine and gets an EPA-estimated 20/27 mpg city/highway. Its starting price is $50,490, but with options our as-tested price climbed to $64,465. To see a side-by-side comparison with the similar Audi Q7 and BMW X5, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe 2012 M-Class retains many of the previous generation’s styling cues, like a wide front grille and forward-swept C-pillars, but the new design looks more substantial and imposing. Contributing to the more muscled look is an upright front end and a boxier overall shape. Whether or not you like the new styling will depend on your preference for evolutionary rather than revolutionary design.\n\nThe Inside\nThe redesigned interior mixes familiar styling cues with new design themes. Thanks to greater use of wood trim — especially on the dashboard — the cabin looks richer. There were, however, some annoying rattles in our test car, and I noticed some chassis flex.\n\nHaving driving a lot of cars lately, the commanding views afforded by the M-Class were a reminder of one of the reasons people like SUVs. The front bucket seats are supportive without being overly firm, and there’s room for taller drivers to get comfortable (I’m 6-foot-1). Simulated leather upholstery is standard, while real leather is optional. With a starting price of nearly $50,000 for the M-Class, you’d think you could get real leather without having to pay extra.\n\nBackseat comfort is decent; there was enough legroom with the driver’s seat adjusted for me. There’s not as much thigh support as I’d like, however, and the backseat doesn’t slide forward or backward for additional cargo space or backseat legroom. The split backrest reclines by lifting a lever at the base of the seat.\n\nThe backseat folds flat with the cargo floor, but you first have to flip the seat cushion forward and make sure the head restraints are lowered. This is a dated, cumbersome design that was once common in SUVs but has largely been abandoned, which makes its presence in a redesigned luxury model all the more unusual.\n\nMercedes updated a key interface — the Comand system — and the changes make the M-Class’ entertainment features easier to use. Prior versions of the SUV had a keypad on the dashboard that filled the role of the knob controller that’s been used in other Mercedes models for years. From a usability perspective, it was a poor substitute. The redesigned M-Class’ new center console incorporates a control knob just in front of the armrest. With this setup, Comand is one of the easier integrated systems to use thanks to intuitive on-screen menus navigated by simple knob movements.\n\nDiesel Delight\nDespite its hefty, 5,040-pound curb weight, the ML350 Bluetec moves out well, with power in reserve at midrange speeds. The diesel’s power characteristics are well-suited to towing, and the SUV is rated to tow up to 7,200 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nThe diesel’s stout low-end torque enables this; it produces 455 pounds-feet from just 1,600 rpm, which is considerably more than the gas V-6’s 273 pounds-feet of torque that arrives at a higher 3,500 rpm. All versions of the SUV have a seven-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nDiesel engine refinement has come a long way, and the M-Class’ diesel V-6 is evidence of this. It starts up quickly, even when outside temperatures are hovering around freezing, and idles smoothly. You can hear a little bit of diesel clatter when outside the SUV, but once you step inside it’s sufficiently muted. The engine sounds a little bit different from a gas engine when accelerating, but it’s close enough that your passengers won’t suspect anything — until you pull up to a truck stop for fuel.\n\nThe diesel’s fuel economy advantage over the gas V-6 is a nice benefit: The EPA rates the diesel at 22 mpg in combined city/highway driving versus 19 mpg with the base gas engine, a 16 percent improvement. I got around 23 mpg, mostly on suburban streets and highways with little stop-and-go traffic. Depending on how much diesel fuel costs where you live, some of the money gained from better mileage could be lost at the pump. A gallon of diesel cost $4.39 when I filled up in suburban Chicago, and nationally it’s 17 cents more than premium gas, which the gas M-Class uses. There’s also the matter of the up-front expense for the diesel M-Class, which starts at $1,500 more than the base gas version.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe M-Class evokes the S-Class’ driving experience in a few ways. For one, it feels especially substantial and planted when cruising on the highway, enhancing driver confidence and lowering driving effort. In tighter confines, like when pulling into a parking garage, the M-Class feels wide, and I found myself creeping forward gingerly.\n\nThen there’s the steering: The optional wood and leather steering wheel spins with a well-oiled smoothness and enough power assistance to kill any hopes of steering feedback. This kind of isolating driving experience is something Mercedes has perfected, so if this is what you’re looking for, the M-Class delivers.\n\nOur test car had Mercedes’ optional Airmatic air suspension, which offers Comfort and Sport modes. The difference between the two is subtle. Sport lowers the SUV and firms up the ride, which makes it feel like someone stole the gel inserts out of your shoes; you feel small bumps in the road that the Comfort setting had soaked up.\n\nThe M-Class’ brake-pedal feel is not as direct and linear as it should be. At times, it feels like there’s a giant block of foam between the bottom of your foot and the brake pedal.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 M-Class was deemed a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, meaning it received the top score of Good in front- and side-impact crash tests, as well as for roof strength and whiplash protection.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Also standard are front and rear side-impact and side curtain airbags, a knee airbag for the driver, and active front head restraints. Mercedes’ standard Attention Assist system monitors driver behavior and issues a warning if it detects drowsiness, while Pre-Safe cinches the front seat belts, adjusts the front head restraints, and closes the sunroof and side windows if it senses an impending crash.\n\nSafety options include front and rear parking sensors, a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning and prevention, collision warning and prevention with full braking capability, a backup camera, adaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and adaptive high-beam headlights.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nM-Class in the Market\nAutomakers have a fascination with sportiness, even to the point of giving minivans and pickup trucks a performance slant. The SUV segment has likewise been touched by this phenomenon, and some of the results have been unremarkable. That’s why the M-Class, in ML350 Bluetec form, is so refreshing: It doesn’t try to be something it’s not. While some of its competitors will continue to emphasize sportiness, the 2012 M-Class gives luxury shoppers a comfort-oriented option.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2012 about the 2012 Mercedes-Benz M-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith the 2012 M-Class, Mercedes brings the comfortable, luxurious driving experience of its flagship S-Class sedan to its most popular SUV.\n\nIf you don’t like to be disturbed by the world around you when you drive, this redesigned luxury SUV is for you.\n\nWe tested the ML350 Bluetec, which is powered by a 240-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel engine and gets an EPA-estimated 20/27 mpg city/highway. Its starting price is $50,490, but with options our as-tested price climbed to $64,465. To see a side-by-side comparison with the similar Audi Q7 and BMW X5, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe 2012 M-Class retains many of the previous generation’s styling cues, like a wide front grille and forward-swept C-pillars, but the new design looks more substantial and imposing. Contributing to the more muscled look is an upright front end and a boxier overall shape. Whether or not you like the new styling will depend on your preference for evolutionary rather than revolutionary design.\n\nThe Inside\nThe redesigned interior mixes familiar styling cues with new design themes. Thanks to greater use of wood trim — especially on the dashboard — the cabin looks richer. There were, however, some annoying rattles in our test car, and I noticed some chassis flex.\n\nHaving driving a lot of cars lately, the commanding views afforded by the M-Class were a reminder of one of the reasons people like SUVs. The front bucket seats are supportive without being overly firm, and there’s room for taller drivers to get comfortable (I’m 6-foot-1). Simulated leather upholstery is standard, while real leather is optional. With a starting price of nearly $50,000 for the M-Class, you’d think you could get real leather without having to pay extra.\n\nBackseat comfort is decent; there was enough legroom with the driver’s seat adjusted for me. There’s not as much thigh support as I’d like, however, and the backseat doesn’t slide forward or backward for additional cargo space or backseat legroom. The split backrest reclines by lifting a lever at the base of the seat.\n\nThe backseat folds flat with the cargo floor, but you first have to flip the seat cushion forward and make sure the head restraints are lowered. This is a dated, cumbersome design that was once common in SUVs but has largely been abandoned, which makes its presence in a redesigned luxury model all the more unusual.\n\nMercedes updated a key interface — the Comand system — and the changes make the M-Class’ entertainment features easier to use. Prior versions of the SUV had a keypad on the dashboard that filled the role of the knob controller that’s been used in other Mercedes models for years. From a usability perspective, it was a poor substitute. The redesigned M-Class’ new center console incorporates a control knob just in front of the armrest. With this setup, Comand is one of the easier integrated systems to use thanks to intuitive on-screen menus navigated by simple knob movements.\n\nDiesel Delight\nDespite its hefty, 5,040-pound curb weight, the ML350 Bluetec moves out well, with power in reserve at midrange speeds. The diesel’s power characteristics are well-suited to towing, and the SUV is rated to tow up to 7,200 pounds when properly equipped.\n\nThe diesel’s stout low-end torque enables this; it produces 455 pounds-feet from just 1,600 rpm, which is considerably more than the gas V-6’s 273 pounds-feet of torque that arrives at a higher 3,500 rpm. All versions of the SUV have a seven-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nDiesel engine refinement has come a long way, and the M-Class’ diesel V-6 is evidence of this. It starts up quickly, even when outside temperatures are hovering around freezing, and idles smoothly. You can hear a little bit of diesel clatter when outside the SUV, but once you step inside it’s sufficiently muted. The engine sounds a little bit different from a gas engine when accelerating, but it’s close enough that your passengers won’t suspect anything — until you pull up to a truck stop for fuel.\n\nThe diesel’s fuel economy advantage over the gas V-6 is a nice benefit: The EPA rates the diesel at 22 mpg in combined city/highway driving versus 19 mpg with the base gas engine, a 16 percent improvement. I got around 23 mpg, mostly on suburban streets and highways with little stop-and-go traffic. Depending on how much diesel fuel costs where you live, some of the money gained from better mileage could be lost at the pump. A gallon of diesel cost $4.39 when I filled up in suburban Chicago, and nationally it’s 17 cents more than premium gas, which the gas M-Class uses. There’s also the matter of the up-front expense for the diesel M-Class, which starts at $1,500 more than the base gas version.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe M-Class evokes the S-Class’ driving experience in a few ways. For one, it feels especially substantial and planted when cruising on the highway, enhancing driver confidence and lowering driving effort. In tighter confines, like when pulling into a parking garage, the M-Class feels wide, and I found myself creeping forward gingerly.\n\nThen there’s the steering: The optional wood and leather steering wheel spins with a well-oiled smoothness and enough power assistance to kill any hopes of steering feedback. This kind of isolating driving experience is something Mercedes has perfected, so if this is what you’re looking for, the M-Class delivers.\n\nOur test car had Mercedes’ optional Airmatic air suspension, which offers Comfort and Sport modes. The difference between the two is subtle. Sport lowers the SUV and firms up the ride, which makes it feel like someone stole the gel inserts out of your shoes; you feel small bumps in the road that the Comfort setting had soaked up.\n\nThe M-Class’ brake-pedal feel is not as direct and linear as it should be. At times, it feels like there’s a giant block of foam between the bottom of your foot and the brake pedal.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 M-Class was deemed a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, meaning it received the top score of Good in front- and side-impact crash tests, as well as for roof strength and whiplash protection.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Also standard are front and rear side-impact and side curtain airbags, a knee airbag for the driver, and active front head restraints. Mercedes’ standard Attention Assist system monitors driver behavior and issues a warning if it detects drowsiness, while Pre-Safe cinches the front seat belts, adjusts the front head restraints, and closes the sunroof and side windows if it senses an impending crash.\n\nSafety options include front and rear parking sensors, a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning and prevention, collision warning and prevention with full braking capability, a backup camera, adaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and adaptive high-beam headlights.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nM-Class in the Market\nAutomakers have a fascination with sportiness, even to the point of giving minivans and pickup trucks a performance slant. The SUV segment has likewise been touched by this phenomenon, and some of the results have been unremarkable. That’s why the M-Class, in ML350 Bluetec form, is so refreshing: It doesn’t try to be something it’s not. While some of its competitors will continue to emphasize sportiness, the 2012 M-Class gives luxury shoppers a comfort-oriented option.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Mercedes-Benz ML320 looks nearly identical to the ML350 and ML550, but is totally different to drive, mostly because the ML320 is a clean-burning diesel. Maybe it’s like dating twins, although I’ve never done it so I can’t say for sure. If you have, let me know if I’m totally off-base (I promise not to judge you).\n\nThis diesel is touchy and uppity. It takes some time to figure out how to finesse it because it’s pretty hyper. I was snapping everyone’s heads around for a day or so until I got used to it. Technically it’s called torque, but I call it herky-jerky. Whatever you call it, it required me to make some adjustments to the way I drove. The smaller diesel engine is quite powerful. On paper, it has much less horsepower than the other models, but I never felt that it was lacking. The EPA-estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway is much better than the ML550’s 13/18 mpg with its gas-guzzling V-8. Am I worried about getting stuck out in the world without a nearby gas station that has diesel fuel? Nope: Mercedes’ Comand information and entertainment system instantly finds gas stations with diesel for me. It’s a nice touch for those of us who can be paranoid about that sort of thing.\n\nThe ML320’s BlueTec system makes this diesel vehicle emissions-compliant in all 50 states. This is achieved with a urea additive, AdBlue, that mixes with exhaust fumes and reduces the car’s emissions. Click here to learn more about BlueTec. The engine is pretty quiet, but it still has that diesel sort of growl that’s loudest when idling.\n\nLike its siblings, the ML320 wins me over in the looks department. It’s not trying to convince me that it’s not a completely civilized SUV. It didn’t need me to know that it can navigate almost any surface with its fancy off-roading technology, yet I adjusted the step-in height and the suspension with the press of a button. I put the ML into a crawling gear with the push of yet another button. Look out, world.\n\nThe grille is an interesting feature; its hole-punched chrome makes the ML look modern and kind of aggressive. It’s a nice balance with the rest of the car, which is smooth and lean-looking. The ML320 looked like it had a lower profile despite the doors being nice and tall. It was easy for my kiddos to get into the ML, and they were able to reach the door handle just fine. It should be noted, however, that my 4-year-old is in the 95th percentile for height, just so you know.\n\nThe ML pampered me with its power liftgate, a feature that simplified my mommy life beyond words. The Night Security Illumination package helped rid me of the heebie-jeebies I feel whenever I walk to my car at night; I’m always worried someone’s evil twin is lurking under my car.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great-Excellent (black interior shows scuff marks)\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nEven though it’s fuel-efficient and has clean emissions, the ML320 is still a luxury vehicle. She’d spare nothing to prove it, as evidenced by the beautiful leather seats, wood-inlaid panels and almost more features than you can handle.\n\nHey, wait, did I say leather seats? I meant MB-Tex. MB-Tex isn’t real leather, but it’ll fool you into thinking it is. The inevitable sneaker scuff marks came out of it easily, and the kiddy gunk wiped off without a hitch.\n\nSpeaking of hitches, I did find one with the ML320: The backup camera image doesn’t automatically come up on the screen if the entertainment system isn’t on. This was a disappointment because the camera should come on without any sort of precondition. Also, I have to confess I couldn’t get the DVD player to work. I had to ask MotherProof’s tech geek Emily Hansen to help me out. It turns out that the batteries in the remote were in backward. I have to say that I love a rear entertainment system that’s easy to use – once you put the batteries into it correctly. Each kid had their own system and could watch their own movie or plug in their gadget.\n\nThere were so many techie features in the ML, including an iPod/MP3 media interface, in-dash SD memory card reader and Bluetooth interface for hands-free calling. I generally struggle with this stuff, but the Comand system was easier to use than most, and I figured it out quickly.\n\nThe kids also had plenty of room, which was another thing I loved about the ML. The Latch connectors were easy to access, and kids of all ages could happily log hours in there. Maybe they won’t be happy all the time, but they certainly won’t be cramped.\n\nI have to tell you about the heated steering wheel. Before I do, let me just say that I’m not someone who falls for the first over-the-top car gadget that comes along, but I’m starting to worry about myself. Seriously, is there anything that is more ludicrous than a heated steering wheel? Only on paper, my friends. In real life, it was freaking awesome. Since it snowed during my test drive, the heated steering wheel became one of my favorite over-the-top test-car features.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nThe ML320’s safety features left no stone unturned. The ML felt safe and solid on the road. The doors close with a reassuring sound; everything has a nice, quality feel to it.\n\nThe ML320 has eight standard airbags (including dual-stage front airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side curtain and rear side airbags for passengers in the back), active front head restraints, an electronic stability system, traction system, rollover sensors and 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s enough room for rear-facing infant seats.\n\nIn School: Plenty of cargo room for up-and-coming hobbyists.\n\nTeens: There’s space for teens’ gangly legs and all their stuff.",

      "expert_review": "Knowing who you are and what you’re trying to do is a good first step in being successful. The trouble comes when your task is known, but you start off by working against yourself. For example: You need to get in shape to run a marathon, but your first decision is to buy a carton of cigarettes to smoke during your long runs. That’s trouble.\n\nMercedes-Benz hasn’t gone so far as to make a pack-a-day-smoker/marathoner combo with its M-Class, but there are some questionable things going on with it.\n\nThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz ML400 is a five-seat, midsize SUV that excels in offering comfort and a high-quality interior, yet misses the mark in a couple ways that left me scratching my head.\n\nGas-powered M-Class SUVs now include the ML350, ML400 and ML63 AMG. The ML400 we tested came with a 329-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that for 2015 replaces the ML550 and its 402-hp, turbo 4.7-liter V-8 engine. (Also new is a turbo-diesel four-cylinder in the ML250 Bluetec, which replaces the ML350 Bluetec; the new engine is less powerful but more efficient.) The ML350 is available with rear- or all-wheel drive, but all other trim levels come only with 4Matic all-wheel drive.\n\nAnother big change: The ML400 loses more than 250 pounds versus the ML550; you can compare the full range of specs of the two cars here.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz M-Class competes with other luxury SUVs, such as the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Land Rover LR4, all of which you can compare here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe ML400 has traditional SUV styling, with an upright windshield and a roof that goes straight back to the cargo liftgate rather than curving downward, as do other vehicles that attempt to ape the lines of a coupe.\n\nAround front, the grille and headlights are similar to other Mercedes-Benz cars and SUVs.\n\nHow It Drives\nDriving the ML400 is when you start to sense that some parts of the car are working against each other. The ML400 is a luxury SUV and, as such, can be expected to have a comfortable ride. Our test model also featured Mercedes’ Airmatic suspension, a $1,610 option. Airmatic suspensions I’ve tested do an exceptional job of absorbing bumps and still offering support when you take corners. However, our test model came with optional 20-inch wheels that, while looking lovely, made for shorter tire sidewalls, which contributed to a harsher ride.\n\nI felt at times like the ML was a bit too jittery and wasn’t absorbing bumps as well as other luxury cars with air suspensions — or even some luxury SUVs — that I’ve driven lately. I blame the wheels for that. Further, the ML400 Airmatic setup has a Sport setting, which firms up the suspension. That, combined with the larger rims, made for a very unpleasant driving experience. I felt every small ripple in the road, and my head bounced off the head restraint when I hit a larger bump.\n\nWhat really irks me about the Sport setting is it’s just a suspension change: There’s no effect on the engine or transmission. You’re just hitting a button that makes the ML ride harder.\n\nReally, if you want that higher AMG performance and a sporty ride in the ML class, upgrade to the Mercedes ML63 AMG. If you want a luxury SUV, spend $1,610 on the ML400’s Airmatic suspension, keep it out of Sport mode and don’t bother with the 20-inch rims.\n\nThe rest of the ML400’s driving experience is quite good. The steering is light but still feels connected, fitting the lighter-is-better feel usually found in luxury SUVs. I never felt like the Mercedes-Benz ML was floating along, as other SUVs can, but the steering didn’t have the feedback that the BMW X5 has.\n\nAcceleration is very good. I worried about the decrease in horsepower versus the 2014, but it wasn’t noticeable on the road; the car’s weight loss must help with your sensation of the engine’s power. Overall, it’s got good power for passing on the highway and for merging and accelerating away from stoplights, and the engine makes a nice, snarling sound when pushed.\n\nFinally, as a side note, the ML400 has the most unobtrusive engine stop-start feature of any car I’ve driven. If it weren’t for a light on the dash, I wouldn’t notice when the car was shutting on and off. That’s a nice touch and something everybody — but particularly luxury-car brands — should be doing.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz M-Class requires premium gas. The ML400 gets an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 18/22/20 mpg city/highway/combined, which compares favorably to the 14/19/16 mpg that the 2014 ML550 got. Further, the ML400 with all-wheel drive gets better mileage than the ML350 with all-wheel drive (17/22/19 mpg).\n\nInterior\nThe ML400 has a pretty interior in a way not many cars do. After driving the ML400 for a while, I realized it was one of the rare cars where everything — from the center console lid to the heating controls — looked and felt like it was the correct choice for the car. Nothing felt like a cheap piece left over from the parts bin, even though things like the climate control rings have the same style as other Mercedes cars.\n\nEven the power hatch closing button on the liftgate looked nice … and I was especially drawn to it after testing a competitor’s luxury SUV offering and noticed that its rubbery button was carried over from its non-luxury brand. That’s a small thing, sure, but details set mainstream apart from luxury, and Mercedes largely nailed those small things.\n\nIt is worth noting, though, that our test model came with the optional Open-Pore Brown Ash Wood trim ($160) that looked and felt like wood — something I find to be rare in cars today — as well as a package that included heated, cooling and massaging front seats; heated rear seats; and a rear climate control zone. It all added up to more than $3,300, which is a lot of money, but the quality was worth it.\n\nAlso, the rear seats are roomy and comfortable in terms of head, leg and hip room. There’s just more room in the rear cabin area than other SUVs have, period. I found it very easy to turn around (so that my knees were on the seat) and reach behind into the cargo area. Nearly every other SUV in which I tried that maneuver made it a literal pain.\n\nMercedes-Benz also deserves praise for the ML’s outward visibility. It was the best SUV I’ve driven in a long time on that front. In an era of sloping roof pillars that seem designed for either a stylist or a wind tunnel, it’s nice to sit in a car in which its designers took into account the fact that someone might need to see out of the car.\n\nThat’s not to say everything in the interior is peachy: For starters, I found the silver finish on a few of the buttons to be nice, but sunlight occasionally washed out their white markings, making it impossible to tell what switch I was hitting.\n\nAlso, while the rear seats are comfortable, the only rear cupholders on our test model were embedded in the fold-down center armrest, so you could carry either drinks or three people in the rear, but not both.\n\nLastly, the standard interior is Mercedes’ MB-Tex vinyl interior. It was not on our test model, but it’s worth noting that upgrading to leather seats on the ML350 costs more than $1,600.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMercedes-Benz uses its Comand system to control features such as navigation, radio and other functions. Overall, I found the system easy to use and responsive. What really helps is that there’s a simple Back button if you manage to find your way onto the wrong menu. Also, I think using a rotary knob to scroll through things such as radio stations is a smart decision.\n\nAll in all, I used the system extensively throughout my drive because it was easy to use, but there was one fairly major area that left me scratching my head: The optional seats can be adjusted multiple ways, and you can adjust the main settings — height, seatback angle, distance from pedals — using buttons on the door, but things like the lumbar and side support have to be accessed through the center media screen. That’s not the quickest or easiest way to make the adjustments, and it’s not intuitive. I felt like when I turned the dial clockwise on one setting to make the bolster more supportive, I had to turn it counterclockwise on another setting to get more support.\n\nThe only saving grace was the memory settings for the seat. Without those, I honestly don’t think I’d pay for the uber-adjustable seats. It’s just a long, fiddly process to get everything “just so.” Another editor who had time in the ML400 never learned how to change the seats at all, because it’s so hard to figure out where to go to make the adjustments.\n\nCargo & Storage\nInterior storage — with the exception of the rear cupholders — is very good. Up front, there are multiple cupholders, a really useful indentation I used for my parking pass, plus a fairly large center console. I was not wanting for more places to put my stuff up front.\n\nIn back, the cargo area is on par with the ML-Class’ body type competitors. Interestingly, Mercedes uses an old seat-folding design, where you must first raise the seat bottom then fold the seatbacks down. (It’s not recommended to just fold the backrests and live with an uneven cargo floor.)\n\nI’m of two minds when it comes to the seat-folding design. It’s a two-step process where other automakers have managed to do it in one, and the seatbacks are quite heavy and harder to raise back into position than those in other cars. On the other hand, the cargo area is large — easily swallowing my largest bike. Also, Mercedes was thoughtful enough to put loops on the seat bottoms, which not only made raising them easier, but also meant that I didn’t have to jam my hand down into the seat bottom — where someone else’s bottom had just been — to raise the seat.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz M-Class is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus. To earn that designation, a vehicle must receive ratings of good or acceptable in the small-overlap frontal test; good in the other four tests; and basic, advanced or superior for frontal collision prevention features, whether those features are standard or optional.\n\nOur test model came with a Driver Assistance Package, a $1,950 option that includes blind spot assist, lane-keeping assist and Mercedes-Benz’ Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control system, which itself includes Pre-Safe Brake, a forward collision warning system with autonomous braking. In addition, our test car also came with a $1,390 Lighting Package that includes bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge lighting with active curve lighting.\n\nYou can check out all the safety features here. Our child-safety seat tests can be found here.\n\nThe M-Class is not predicted to have good reliability.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOur test model cost $79,310 as-equipped, and that’s within the realm of what you’d pay for higher-end versions of the Q7 and X5.\n\nWhat the ML400 delivered, compared with the Q7 and especially the X5, was a more comfortable ride and a prettier interior. Those competitors, particularly the X5, offer a firmer ride and a sportier driving experience. The Q7 I found to be in the middle, offering a sporty-ish, luxury-ish compromise between the polar extremes of the X5 and ML400.\n\nPeople considering the ML400 would be best served by carefully considering their options. The larger, 20-inch rims are not where I’d spend my money, but I would go for the Airmatic suspension and the comfortable — if difficult to adjust — seats.\n\nThat’s because the ML400 is best when it’s clearly focused on being a comfortable, pretty, midsize luxury SUV, and I believe those options help it be that.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The high-performance SUV category is one of my favorites.\n\nPerhaps because this particular type of vehicle doesn’t make much sense or it’s simply a pariah in a parking lot of political correctness.\n\nSport utility vehicles in general have been the punching bag for many groups that want the government to enforce tougher emission standards, higher fuel economy numbers and all sorts of regulations. SUVs catch the ire of many rather than the approving applause they should get for being an all-in-one kind of vehicle.\n\nSouping them up only makes performance SUVs more endearing. They are the ultimate bad boys of highway driving, often angering other drivers, who point one particular finger straight up when they zoom past. I relish the outrage and often point the same finger right back at them: “Yeah, you’re No. 1, too.”\n\nTrue story: This has happened to me in a Hummer H2 SUT, a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, an H3 and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid.\n\nBut it has never happened to me while in the 2011 Mercedes Benz ML 63 AMG. It seems to fall under the eco-guilt radar. It’s not particularly big or offensive, and simply decoding the Mercedes nomenclature requires a Secret Society Decoder Pin to actually know the letters AMG just mean really, really fast.\n\nThe ML certainly looks fast, even when it’s parked. It has a nicely wedged shape and great grooves around its body. The front end tilts in at the top and carries the line up the well-formed hood and through the fast windshield. Even the grille looks fast, with three bars across it and giant Mercedes gun sight drawn on it. There’s an additional Mercedes badge on the hood.\n\nThe five-spoke wheels are placed far out on the edges of this SUV’s profile, which makes it look a little off-kilter. The same wheel placement works well with a sedan, but the high roofline of the SUV gives it a different dimension that looks a little off balance.\n\nStretching the wheel base to more than 114 inches, however, does make the ML 63 AMG feel more balanced. If it were smaller, it might feel like it’s going to flip over at any minute when flying around some big, long corner with such a powerful engine under the hood. A combination of fantastic sticky tires, heavy body and a wide track help tame this raucous machine.\n\nNASA-like thrust\n\nOne reason the ML 63 AMG surprises people is no one would expect a 6.3-liter V-8 under its nicely creased hood. The engine produces 503 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque, which means this SUV produces NASA-thrust kind of numbers. It blasts off.\n\nThat makes it all the more fun to drive. It can take a 5,000-pound vehicle and make it feel like a race car. (Mercedes says its 0-60 time is 4.8 seconds â€” and it will keep going faster from there.)\n\nThe seven-speed automatic transmission glides through the gears, even when driving aggressively â€” the most fun way to drive this SUV. Naturally, driving like that won’t let you hit the EPA-posted mileage numbers of 11 mpg city and 15 mpg highway.\n\nBut if you’re spending more than $90,000 for a five-passenger SUV, are you really concerned with the mileage?\n\nNo, you’re more concerned with passing everyone. The ML 63 AMG certainly will let you do that.\n\nThe one downside is this Mercedes can feel a little unwieldy at times. Part of this might actually be the driver and not the vehicle. The independent suspension, 4Matic all-wheel-drive system and highly advanced stability control actually makes this SUV handle like a sports car. It can rip through corners and burn up straightaways.\n\nWith the driver sitting in a nicely bolstered seat in a high-riding position, the forces on your body â€” specifically your head and inner ear â€” make it feel like you’re going too fast or close to losing control. The reality is you’re not, but it doesn’t stop you from feeling that way.\n\nAnd that’s not all\n\nThere are more than a few hidden features with the ML 63 AMG.\n\nThe interior is plush and extravagant. There are a host of safety features, luxury items and telemetric that all enhance the driving experience. The ML 63 AMG can connect to your cellphone via Bluetooth and play Sirius satellite radio and everything else through the 610-watt Harman Kardon stereo system.\n\nIt can sense when you’re about to be in an accident and utilize Mercedes PRE-SAFE technology, tightening the seat belts seconds before impact, rolling up the windows for better support for side-curtain airbags and close the sunroof if there’s a chance of a rollover.\n\nThe best part of driving the ML 63 AMG is the riding position. It’s nice and high, so you can look out over the cars in front of you. There’s also a lot of utility, so this vehicle can be loaded up with tons of stuff. Even with the comfortable second row in use, there’s nearly 30 cubic feet of space. Fold the second row down and there’s 72.4 cubic feet of space.\n\nIt can carry almost anything out of a big-box home improvement store.\n\nIt also can carry five adults into the city for a night on the town. Really, the ML 63 AMG can do just about anything. It’s an SUV, after all, and that’s not a bad thing.\n\nBut this ML 63 AMG is more than just an SUV. It’s a high-powered rocket with a Nappa leather interior and more horses under the hood than most stampedes. The fact it’s an SUV only makes it that much better.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes’ midsize M-Class SUV was significantly redesigned last year with exterior and interior styling changes, slight efficiency boosts, new and upgraded features and one of the first diesel models clean enough to be sold in all 50 states. The evolution of the M-Class continues for 2010 with the introduction of a hybrid model. Competitors include the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Land Rover LR4.\n\nSkip to details on the: ML 450 Hybrid\n\nExterior\nAlmost all the exterior changes for 2009 made the M-Class look lower and broader. The grille was lower and the fog lights were farther apart, for example. The stainless-steel skid plates — front and rear — pulled the eye downward. One exception was the side mirrors, whose signal lights grew and spread, threatening to overtake the entire mirror enclosure. The headlamps gained a new shape, and the taillights incorporated smoked lenses.\n\nStandard roof rails, optional crossbars\nDual exhaust outlets\nStandard 19-inch wheels; 20- and 21-inch rims optional\nOptional front and rear parking sensors\n\nInterior\nThe M-Class accommodates up to five occupants. The powered front seats include a driver’s-side four-way power lumbar adjustment. A 60/40-split rear seat creates a level load surface when folded. Cargo volume totals 29.4 cubic feet with the seats up and 72.4 cubic feet with the seats folded. The optional Comand interface — which controls the optional navigation system, the stereo and other functions — was upgraded last year with new menus and additional features.\n\nOptional leather-seating package\nOptional front and rear heated seats\nOptional heated steering wheel\nOptional Harman Kardon audio\nOptional backseat entertainment system with two screens\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available in the M-Class. The base ML350 comes standard with rear-wheel drive, but all other M-Class models have Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. When properly equipped, an all-wheel-drive non-hybrid M-Class can tow up to 7,200 pounds.\n\nML350 has a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 268 horsepower\nML550’s V-8 makes 382 hp\nML63 AMG gets 503 hp from a 6.2-liter V-8\nML350 Bluetec diesel uses a 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 210 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque\nAll engines team with a seven-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbag\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints\nPre-Safe, which can cinch the front seat belts and close the windows in case of a crash\n\nML450 Hybrid\nThe technology in the new ML450 Hybrid gives the SUV the ability to move on electric power alone at low speeds, which is one of the reasons Mercedes estimates it will get 21/24 mpg city/highway, which would make it the most efficient M-Class available.\n\nThe ML450 Hybrid features a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 275 hp and two electric motors that are part of the SUV’s transmission. Total system output is 335 hp. One electric motor is designed for acceleration from a standing stop while the other one is meant for on-the-move acceleration. When more power is needed, the gas engine starts automatically.\n\nThis M-Class has a number of familiar hybrid characteristics. The engine sometimes turns off when the car comes to a stop and starts again when the vehicle begins to move. The ML450 Hybrid also features regenerative braking, capturing energy that would otherwise be lost as heat and instead using it to replenish the hybrid system’s high-voltage battery pack.\n\nThe ML450 Hybrid is distinguished from its siblings by some exterior styling cues, including its liftgate badge, a different hood and special 19-inch wheels. Inside, occupants can monitor the hybrid system’s operation and fuel economy with the optional Comand screen on the dash. Back to top",
