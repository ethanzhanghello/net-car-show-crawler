      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe delivers driving excitement and cabin refinement, but it’s dampered a bit by a wonky transmission, poor rear sight lines and frustrating touch-sensitive controls.\n\nVersus the competition: The GLC43 is more expensive and less efficient than some rivals, but it’s also more powerful.\n\nThe GLC is Mercedes-Benz’s entry in the luxury compact SUV class, and it’s available in a traditional SUV shape as well as a sloped-roof, four-door coupe version. The Mercedes-Benz GLC SUV was refreshed for the 2023 model year with updated tech and styling, and the coupe gets the same treatment for 2024.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC350e Review: Use It or Lose It\n\nThe GLC comes in several flavors. For this review, I drove the AMG GLC43 Coupe; you can also check out Cars.com’s reviews of the GLC300 SUV and GLC350e plug-in hybrid. The coupe competes against other coupeified compact SUVs with sport-oriented models, such as the Audi SQ5 Sportback and BMW X4 M40i; see the models compared.\n\nAn Animal on the Road\n\nThe GLC43’s drivetrain is quite memorable — a little too memorable, perhaps, given how often I found myself thinking about its transmission. The nine-speed multiclutch automatic is unpredictable and unrefined, holding back an otherwise potent and capable engine.\n\nAnd that engine has some big cylinders to fill: The 2024 AMG GLC43 Coupe’s 416-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder replaces the previous GLC43’s 385-hp, twin-turbo V-6. The new turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder is augmented by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, with all-wheel drive standard.\n\nIf you did a double take at these numbers, so did I — 416 hp is pretty bonkers for a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It’s not surprising that this engine can feel edgy and high-strung in everyday driving, and this Mercedes’ sometimes surging, sometimes bogging automatic transmission doesn’t help.\n\nShifts are hectic in slower-speed stop-and-go driving, and it’s tough to pull away smoothly — even after a few days of getting acclimated to the car. There’s a pronounced power delay from the engine, and the transmission struggles to stay in step with its demands until higher speeds, where it meets your needs more quickly and predictably.\n\nSeveral other characteristics combine to create a caged-animal driving dynamic, like a rowdy exhaust note, grabby brakes, twitchy steering and a brittle ride from the sport-tuned suspension — and that’s in Comfort mode. Switching drive modes to the most aggressive Sport Plus setting alters accelerator response, steering and shift patterns to really unleash the beast.\n\nOverall, there’s an urgent, frantic quality to the driving experience that doesn’t quite match the coupe’s refined, luxurious interior (more on that below). Some drivers may like it, but the GLC43 is tuned a bit too aggressively for my everyday driving needs.\n\nAgainst the competition, its fuel economy is just OK; the GLC43 Coupe is EPA-rated 18/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, which is just slightly less than the SUV version. Compare that with the Audi SQ5’s 19/24/21 mpg rating from its 349-hp, turbo V-6 and the BMW X4 M40i’s 22/26/23 mpg rating from its 382-hp, turbo six-cylinder engine.\n\nA Gilded-Cage Cabin\n\nAlthough the GLC43’s road manners are unruly, the cabin’s vibe is sedate. The design is uncluttered and the materials are lovely —  even the MB-Tex imitation leather looks and feels like the real deal. My test model featured black seats and surfaces, with red accents, carbon-fiber trim and gloss-black paneling for a sporty, put-together look. Both the front and rear seats are supple and cushy, and aside from the engine, noises are well hushed. It all combines to create a calm, quiet and cozy experience.\n\nMaybe a little too cozy for some, in fact: The GLC Coupe’s cabin is pretty small. At 5 feet, 6 inches, I fit fine in the driver’s seat, but a taller editor struggled to fit comfortably and had issues getting in and out due to the narrow door openings.\n\nPoor visibility also complicates front-seat comfort. Views are heavily obscured straight back and to the rear corners thanks to the GLC Coupe’s sloping roofline and small rear windows.\n\nThings are tighter still in the backseat. It’s wide enough for two adults, but the middle position is unusable thanks to a skinny seat width and large floor hump. The coupe has just 38 inches of max rear headroom, which is nearly 2 inches less space than the SUV, so taller adults will likely feel the pinch. Coupe-style SUV competitors offer similar backseat space.\n\nKids in car seats won’t fare much better. In our Car Seat Check, the GLC43 Coupe scored well for its easy-access Latch anchors, but rear-facing car seats earned lower grades due to the GLC’s lack of backseat legroom.\n\nIn terms of cargo space, the coupe again offers a little less space than the SUV version. Mercedes-Benz says the coupe has 21.5 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, which is slightly less than the SUV’s 21.9 cubic feet. By comparison, the Audi SQ5 Sportback has 24.7 cubic feet of cargo space, while the BMW X4 M40i has just 18.5 cubic feet, according to manufacturer estimates. A hands-free power liftgate is standard on the GLC43.\n\nTouchy Controls\n\nWhile I like the clean, streamlined look of the GLC43’s controls, usability isn’t great for some of them. Like the SUV, the GLC Coupe has a redesigned dashboard with new floating displays, including an 11.9-inch tablet-style center touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster behind the steering wheel.\n\nThis new central screen houses the latest version of the MBUX multimedia system, but it also includes touch controls for things like climate functions — and therein lies the problem. While I found the infotainment system’s menu structure to be fairly easy to figure out, system responsiveness was an issue, with on-screen controls sometimes requiring multiple touches to get results, which can be frustrating.\n\nThe issue carried over to the steering wheel, which also features touch-sensitive panels that I kept nudging on accident — also frustrating. The MBUX system’s voice controls (via the “Hey Mercedes” voice prompt) worked well, but a physical button is just easier to use. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are also standard, and Android Auto connected seamlessly during my drives.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe Brings Electrified Power, Off-Road Tech\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\nMercedes-Benz GLC350e PHEV Starts at $61,050, Gets 54-Mile Electric Range\nMercedes-Benz GLC, GLE Earn IIHS Top Safety Award\nShop for a New Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Near You\nSafety and Pricing\n\nBlind spot warning, an attention monitor, and forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking are standard.

Also optional is an augmented video system that uses live camera views for augmented-reality navigation functions.\n\nPrices start at $71,750 (including destination) for the 2024 AMG GLC43 Coupe — a not-insignificant $5,650 more than the AMG GLC43 SUV. The competition starts lower: The 2025 Audi SQ5 Sportback starts at $63,095 and the 2025 BMW X4 M40i at $67,875.\n\nThe AMG GLC43 will appeal to a niche group of shoppers looking for coupe styling and performance-car dynamics in a luxury compact SUV body. I’m not in that group, but if you are, it’s worth checking out some rivals before you settle on this one.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was updated Sept. 30, 2020, to add our driving impressions on the AMG GLC43 Coupe.\n\nThe verdict: Stylish, luxurious and blisteringly fast in AMG form, the compact GLC-Class crossover is the C-Class sedan for people who need more cargo space.\n\nVersus the competition: The GLC-Class easily compares in size, technology, luxury and price to the BMW X3, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q5 and a host of other premium-brand crossovers.\n\nYou don’t need me to tell you that SUVs are selling like crazy right now. You’re probably thinking of buying one yourself, and maybe you’re thinking of buying this one: the updated 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC300: Don’t Judge This Benz by Its Cover\n\nIf so, you’re not alone. The GLC-Class has surpassed the C-Class compact sedan to become Mercedes-Benz’s best-selling model in the U.S., and for good reason: For a few bucks more than a C-Class, you get more space and headroom, plus the same quality interior, top-notch amenities, modern multimedia system and loads of available extra-cost safety equipment. For 2020, Mercedes-Benz has updated the GLC’s styling, powertrains and some interior bits to keep its most popular model on top in a competitive class.\n\nAfter spending some time in a standard GLC300 as well as the racy AMG GLC43 and GLC63 pair, we’ve come to appreciate the idea of having one as an alternative to a standard C-Class sedan.\n\nThe Best Seller: 2020 GLC300\n\nThe base model sold in the U.S. is the GLC300, equipped with a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and nine-speed automatic transmission. It can have rear- or all-wheel drive and makes 14 more hp than the outgoing model, though torque is unchanged at a stout 273 pounds-feet. It’s smooth and punchy, but suffers a bit of lag on initial acceleration.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s the transmission tuning or actual engine turbo lag, but there’s a noticeable hesitation between the movement of your right foot and the car’s acceleration response. Switching the drive mode into one of its sportier settings (Sport and Sport Plus are available) doesn’t seem to help much, though it does change transmission behavior, keeping it in a lower gear. The lag doesn’t negatively impact the overall feel of the GLC300, which is tuned more for comfort than sport anyway, but it’s noticeable when you call for quick acceleration.\n\nFuel economy for the base engine is decent, coming in at an EPA-estimated 22/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the rear-wheel-drive base model, 21/28/24 mpg with 4Matic all-wheel drive.\n\nComfort is more the GLC300’s game. While it’s a bit tight inside due to it being a compact SUV, it’s a comfortable cabin with highly adjustable seats, decent legroom and plenty of headroom for front occupants. Storage up front is limited; there aren’t a lot of places to put your stuff except the cupholders. (Just hope you didn’t need to put a cup there.) Backseat passengers are a bit more cramped, but the space is comparable to competitors such as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Jaguar F-Pace.\n\nWhat you’ll notice most about the GLC is how quiet it is: The engine itself is impressively muted; there’s absolutely no wind noise even at highway speeds; and road noise through the tires is hushed. It’s an astonishingly serene driving experience for a compact crossover. The steering is heavily boosted, especially at lower speeds, but stable and well controlled, especially as speeds start to climb.\n\nThe only issue I have with the GLC300’s drive is the ride quality, which is surprisingly stiff. I blame my test vehicle’s 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires; while the wheels served to spice up the look of the GLC quite nicely and offered plenty of grip, the short-sidewall tires definitely transmitted a lot of New Jersey’s broken pavement harshness to the cabin, where the SUV’s copious levels of sound and body insulation couldn’t quite filter out the worst of the bumps. The standard 18-inch wheels may not be as sexy, but if you live anywhere with changing seasons and their resulting road-surface conditions, you’ll appreciate the taller-sidewall tires’ ability to soak up bumps a lot more than the bigger wheels’ looks.\n\nRefined Technology\n\nThe GLC’s interior updates are minor but welcome. The biggest change is the introduction of MBUX, Mercedes-Benz’s next-generation touchscreen-based multimedia system that provides a streamlined user interface and some really slick features not seen from any other automakers.\n\nYes, you could plug in your personal electronics and use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — but if you do, you’ll miss out on the navigation system’s eye-popping augmented reality turn-by-turn directional arrows. A forward-facing camera shows you the view ahead, and upon approaching a turn a magic arrow appears, floating on the screen. The only way this would be cooler is if it were projected onto the windshield itself.\n\nThe only drawback to having the MBUX system is that you can’t say the word “Mercedes” in the car without activating the Siri/Alexa-style voice concierge, interrupting your music or conversation and forcing you to grumble “Cancel!” at the car.  Most annoying. When you intend to trigger the voice-control function (by saying “Hey Mercedes”), the voice controls of the MBUX system work reasonably well. That said, accessing your personal music on your smartphone is not exactly trouble-free.\n\nThe GLC has a new steering wheel, and while that’s not usually something worthy of mention, this one includes Mercedes-Benz’s touch-sensitive five-way controllers on each spoke. They work as well here as they do in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles — which is to say, poorly. Having touch-sensitive controls on a steering wheel is a ridiculous idea; it means having to focus on avoiding touching the wheel in certain places and occasionally changing a setting or channel or switching songs when you don’t intend to. Then, when you do intend to use the controls, it’s easy to scroll past the thing you’re trying to select. I’m not sure why they went from dedicated five-way rocker switches to touch-sensitive buttons, but it was definitely a step backward for user-friendliness.\n\nThe only other major development for the 2020 GLC is newly available driver-safety technology in the form of Active Distance Assist Distronic and Active Steering Assist. These bring some of the semi-autonomous driving functions of other Mercedes-Benz models to the GLC, allowing for hands-free driving for limited periods, automatic lane changes using just the turn signal, and automatic slowing of a vehicle in cruise control when approaching a bend or junction in the road. It works as well as it does in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles: You can’t have your hands off the wheel for too long or the car yells at you and will eventually deactivate the system. It’s marketed as a steering-assist feature, not a true hands-off solution like GM’s Super Cruise or BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant, but it does indeed alleviate the burden of tedious driving along straight, boring highways or in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n\nThe Spicy Alternative: 2020 AMG GLC63\n\nThe maniacs over at Mercedes’ AMG division applied their touch to the GLC (as they have to seemingly everything in the Mercedes showroom these days), crafting the Mercedes-AMG GLC63. It’s equipped with a hand-built, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 making 469 hp and 479 pounds-feet of torque. Alternatively, you can opt for a GLC63 S, which ups those numbers to 503 hp and 516 pounds-feet. All-wheel drive is standard, and the nine-speed automatic gets special tuning to handle all that torque. The EPA fuel-economy estimate drops to 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined with the big engine.\n\nExternally, the GLC63 gets considerably different styling, with a vertical-strake grille, wider fenders and bumpers, integrated trapezoidal tailpipes, and new LED light patterns for the headlights and taillights.\n\nThe driving experience is worlds different from the lesser GLC300, showing you just what an electronically adjustable air suspension and massive turbocharged V-8 can do. The whole package is a bit nuts for a compact SUV, but that’s kind of the point of the GLC63. It’s never going to see a racetrack — nobody would take an SUV out for a club track-day event — but out on the street, the combination of much more aggressive, fat-fendered styling and the brawny V-8 and its instant torque is crazy fun.\n\nThe Medium Heat: 2020 AMG GLC43\n\nAs its nomenclature suggests, the GLC43 is an AMG-lite version with an in-between engine: a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 385 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque. Like the GLC300, it has notable accelerator lag, both from a standing start and accelerating while already in motion — the latter due more to its nine-speed automatic transmission, a stubborn actor for downshifts. Once all systems are go, the GLC43 accelerates swiftly, especially as revs climb. But the whole of it gives a sort of binary sensation of power: It’s either on or off, and not always on your preferred timing.\n\nLike in the GLC300, shock absorption remained firm in our GLC43, which rode 21-inch wheels and the sort of low-profile tires required with gargantuan wheels on a compact SUV. (Adaptive shock absorbers are standard across the line; AMG models trade coil springs for air springs.) Still, the GLC43 felt more hunkered down than the GLC300, with better body control and less bounciness than its non-AMG sibling sometimes exhibited.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPowered-Up Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe, SUV Join 2020 GLC Squad\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 SUV Gets Light Exterior Updates, Modern Tech\nHey, Mercedes! Voice-Activated Assistant Drives New MBUX System\nResearch the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC300\nResearch the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC63\nThe Weird Ones: 2020 GLC Coupe\n\nWant all the high-riding style of a crossover SUV but none of its headroom or cargo utility? Well, Mercedes-Benz has the answer: a coupe version of the GLC that’s meant to go head-to-head with the BMW X4. GLC Coupes feature a chopped-top look and swoopy hatchback, and they’re available in GLC300, AMG 43, AMG 63 and AMG 63 S versions. They behave exactly like the SUV version of the GLC, with the same powertrains, suspensions, and ride and handling characteristics. The biggest difference in how they feel stems from the loss of the GLC SUV’s excellent all-around visibility: The new gun-slit rear window doesn’t even have a wiper, meaning your already dramatically curtailed rear view will get even worse in the rain.\n\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 Coupe | Manufacturer images\n\nThe only reason to choose a GLC Coupe over the standard SUV is style — and that’s of questionable taste, given choosing a coupe comes with the stigma of anyone conversant in automobiles recognizing you’ve spent a lot of money on something silly. Our advice: Stick with the already stylish SUV version. If you must have something more stylish, pop your extra cash into an AMG version, which provides both extra style and a lot more entertainment value.\n\nGLC-Class Pricing: Luxury and Speed Never Come Cheap\n\nStarting price for a rear-wheel-drive 2020 GLC300 is $43,495 (prices include destination fee). That price bumps up to $45,495 if you want 4Matic all-wheel drive or $50,995 if you want a GLC300 Coupe. Start adding safety features and fancy interior bits, such as the stellar head-up display, and that number quickly climbs. The as-tested price for my loaded GLC300 4Matic came to an eye-popping $63,835. That’s just past the starting price of the cheapest AMG version, the AMG GLC43 ($60,495). The GLC63, meanwhile, starts at $74,745 for a GLC63 or $85,095 for a GLC63 S Coupe. Load up a GLC63 S Coupe and you’ll come perilously close to the $100,000 mark. That’s a lot of money for a compact SUV.\n\nThere’s also a plug-in hybrid, the GLC350e, which comes only in SUV form (that is to say, not as a GLC Coupe). With 22 miles of EPA-rated electric range, the GLC350e starts at $52,895 for 2020. But Mercedes is, er, pulling the plug on the GLC350e after the 2020 model year. Interested shoppers should get one while they can — or go all-electric in the forthcoming EQC400.\n\nDespite its formidable price, this is still Mercedes-Benz’s most popular model, and for good reason. The GLC300’s combination of refinement, comfort, technology, safety, efficiency and utility is definitely a winning one. Yes, it’s expensive, but its customers don’t seem to mind, finding value in the price commensurate with the experience of owning one (or, more likely, leasing one). If you want the best GLC you can get, the AMG GLC63 is worth the extra cost, providing a highly entertaining driving experience and an opulent, technology-packed cabin.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz has been on a multiyear quest to rename some (but not all) of its models, and the compact SUV once known as the GLK-Class became the GLC-Class with a redesign for the 2016 model year. Mercedes also changed how it names models from its AMG performance division, giving them the Mercedes-AMG label, followed by a series of letters and numbers — in this case, GLC43. In addition to the traditional SUV body style, Mercedes also sells a four-door, coupelike version of the GLC43 that competes with the X4. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nMany performance SUV enthusiasts will be pleasantly surprised by the GLC43. Where the GLC300 emphasizes luxury, smoothness and isolation from the road, the GLC43 offers more directness and connectedness, and its suspension tuning plays a big part in that. \n\nThe Mercedes AMG GLC43 has an adaptive air suspension with settings controlled by a Dynamic Select system. Comfort mode, however, is a bit of a misnomer; bumps and other road imperfections are acutely felt in this setting. Sport is slightly firmer, but Sport Plus firms up the suspension considerably: The ride turns hard and there’s very little damping. On the plus side, the GLC43 corners flatly and body motions are well-controlled.\n\nThe suspension is just one of the GLC43’s adjustable systems. The Dynamic Select modes also tailor steering, gas pedal responsiveness and transmission operation. Selecting Sport Plus dramatically alters the transmission’s shift program, letting the engine rev higher before upshifting when accelerating, staying in lower gears even at higher speeds and downshifting more aggressively. If you’d prefer to change gears yourself, there are shift paddles on the steering wheel. \n\nThe Mercedes AMG GLC 43’s twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine is rated at 362 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque. It teams with a nine-speed automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels through a rear-biased all-wheel-drive system. Its AMG-tuned nine-speed automatic felt better sorted than the nine-speed I drove in an early GLC300. You can hear and feel the AMG’s frequent upshifts when starting out from a stop, but it’s not obtrusive, and if you’re not paying attention to it, the gear changes blend into the background. I liked the transmission’s responsiveness on the highway; press the gas pedal a bit when cruising, and it will immediately downshift to give you more power. \n\nWhile power from the turbocharged V-6 won’t blow you away like the engines in some high-powered SUVs, it’s more than adequate. Whether turning onto a road ahead of traffic or merging with fast-moving highway flow, the V-6 gets the GLC43 up to speed swiftly. Mercedes says it can go from zero-to-60 mph in 4.8 seconds, compared with 6.3 seconds in the GLC300 (6.4 seconds with all-wheel drive). \n\nSpeed freaks might be wise to wait until the beginning of 2018 for the GLC63 and GLC63 S that were unveiled at the 2017 New York International Auto Show. The GLC63 pumps out 469 hp from its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, while the higher-output GLC63 S makes 503 hp. EPA-estimated gas mileage for the GLC43 is 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined. \n\nMercedes has dramatically improved its vehicles’ steering in recent years. You can see this in the GLC43, which has weighty steering that’s direct and precise. It’s a big part of why this SUV is enjoyable to drive.\n\nInterior \n\nThe GLC43’s cabin complements its performance aspirations. The front bucket seats are finished in simulated leather with faux suede inserts, and the large side bolsters do a good job holding you in place through quick corners without feeling overly confining on the commute home from work. \n\nThat’s not to say Mercedes has abandoned the luxury part of the equation. The cabin is trimmed in high-grade materials like standard aluminum and optional carbon fiber, and the dashboard controls and knob-based Comand multimedia system are mostly intuitive. There are also features you might not expect, like an in-cabin fragrance system that perfumes the air coming out of the vents. \n\nI was a bit surprised by how snug the cabin feels. I like to have the seat raised when I drive, and there wasn’t much headroom in the GLC43. (Our test car had an optional panoramic moonroof, a feature that tends to decrease headroom.)\n\nAlso, once I had the seat and steering wheel where I wanted them, I couldn’t see the top of the trip computer in the instrument cluster. That happens to be where Mercedes puts information related to Dynamic Select mode and parking sensors, and having to duck my head to see around the steering wheel was an annoyance I don’t experience in most cars.\n\nThe rear seats, surprisingly, feel a bit roomier than the front because the lower bench gives you more headroom. The seat doesn’t slide and the backrest doesn’t recline, but comfort is nonetheless good for adults.\n\nThe GLC43’s overall cargo space and configurability are exceptional. The SUV has 19.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, and folding the backseat gives you 56.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. The split backseat is spring-loaded for easier folding; switches in the rear seating and cargo areas release the backrests, which fold flat with the cargo floor. There’s a shallow storage area for small items under the cargo floor, and the rear of the SUV lowers at the touch of a button to make loading and unloading cargo easier.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the GLC-Class a good rating (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in its moderate overlap front and side-impact crash tests. As of publication, the SUV hadn’t been put through IIHS’ difficult small overlap front crash test.\n\nStandard safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, a driver drowsiness monitor, a blind spot warning system, a backup camera and Pre-Safe. Pre-Safe prepares the SUV for an imminent crash by cinching the front seat belts, adjusting the position of the front passenger seat, and closing the windows and sunroof. Safety options include adaptive cruise control with steering assistance, adaptive LED headlights, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, cross-traffic assist and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe GLC43 probably doesn’t make much sense to performance car purists; SUVs just have too many characteristics — from higher centers of gravity to increased bulk — that are at odds with on-road performance. But that hasn’t kept automakers from making these kinds of vehicles, and it’s easy to see why: Trucks and SUVs are becoming more popular each year as interest in cars — but not performance — wanes.\n\nThe GLC43 enters this new reality well-positioned to compete on both the performance and luxury fronts, but it’ll cost you plenty. The move up from an all-wheel-drive GLC300 to a GLC43 costs nearly $14,000, for a starting price of around $56,000. Optional features and packages on our test car pushed our as-tested price to a heady $69,520.\n\nBut the existence of the GLC43 and the increasing number of models like it begs the question: Is this the sports car of the future? That’s starting to look like a real possibility.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A redesigned GLC touched down for the 2023 model year, and Mercedes-Benz has been busy filling out the model line ever since, with the fastback GLC Coupe and AMG high-performance models. Things are getting really wild in the GLC house for 2025, with the new plug-in hybrid GLC350e and the AMG GLC63 S E Performance. All 2025 GLCs also benefit from more standard equipment, including a third-generation infotainment interface, digital key capability that allows owners to use their phone as a vehicle key, and a center airbag between front-seat occupants. For 2025, the Mercedes GLC starts at $50,400 for the SUV and $60,450 for the Coupe (all prices include the $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC350e Review: Use It or Lose It\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nSUV\nGLC300: $50,400\nGLC300 4Matic: $52,400\nGLC350e 4Matic: $61,050\nAMG GLC43: $68,250\nAMG GLC63 S E Performance: $87,200\nCoupe\nGLC300 4Matic: $60,450\nAMG GLC43: $74,050\nAMG GLC63 S E Performance: $92,600\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC’s Trim Levels?\n\nFrom the get-go, the GLC is equipped with the lengthy list of features one might expect of a Mercedes-Benz. Standard equipment on the GLC300 includes 18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and 64-color ambient lighting. The standard tech suite consists of wireless phone charging, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 11.9-inch touchscreen with voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nBeyond all-wheel drive, the GLC300 4Matic SUV includes no additional content, but the GLC300 4Matic Coupe gains a panoramic moonroof, 19-inch wheels and navigation. The PHEV GLC350e also includes navigation.\n\nGLC SUV buyers get the standard panoramic moonroof in the AMG 43, which in both body styles also includes an adaptive sport suspension with rear-wheel steering and 20-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, synthetic-suede seat trim and a heated steering wheel. In addition to its stratospheric output, the AMG 63 upgrades the GLC Coupe and SUV with dynamic engine mounts and even heartier braking hardware.\n\nThe non-AMG SUV can be upgraded with two optional trim packages, Exclusive and Pinnacle. Only the Pinnacle is available on the coupe and AMG models due to their greater standard content. In configurations where the features are not already standard, the Exclusive includes navigation, 15-speaker Burmester 3D audio, a 360-degree camera system, upgraded ambient lighting and a security system. The Pinnacle builds on that with upgraded headlights and a head-up display with augmented reality navigation.\n\nThe GLC’s standard safety suite is mostly consistent regardless of what powertrain buyers choose. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, automated parking and a driver attention monitor. Coupe and AMG models also include a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is available for all GLCs and adds adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, front cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering, lane change assist and emergency steering assist.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe GLC is available with a wide variety of engines, all of which are backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission. The entry-level GLC300 SUV is the only configuration with rear-wheel drive; the rest of the lineup has Mercedes’ 4Matic AWD standard.\n\nThe GLC300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 295 pounds-feet of torque. With RWD, it returns an EPA-rated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined; the 4Matic gets 23/31/26 mpg.\n\nThe GLC350e supplements the turbo 2.0-liter with a potent electric motor, raising total system output to 313 hp and 406 pounds-feet. Its 23.3-kilowatt-hour battery provides up to 54 miles of electric range. With the gas engine running, it returns an EPA-rated 64 mpg combined.\n\nIn the AMG GLC43, the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder gains an additional electrically driven turbocharger, cranking output to 416 hp and 369 pounds-feet. Whereas the non-AMG GLCs all need about 6 seconds to accelerate from 0-60, the AMG 43 can get there in just 4.7 seconds. In SUV form, it gets 19/25/21 mpg; the coupe is rated at 18/24/21 mpg.\n\nTake the AMG 43 and add a 201-hp electric motor to the rear axle and you’ve got the AMG63 S E Performance and a total of 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet. Its 6.1-kWh battery is only good for a mile or so of electric travel, but the AMG63 is rated at 31 mpg combined and needs only 3.5 seconds to accelerate to 60 mph.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe Review: Fancy, Fast and Flawed\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC43 Coupe?\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
