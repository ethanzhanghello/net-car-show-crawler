      "expert_review": "Say you run a company or just cashed in those stock options at the Internet start-up you’re at, and you’d like a car that proclaims your status. Here’s what to expect when popping 83 large ones on Mercedes Benz new S-Class sedans:\n\nA choice of two powerful V-8s: a 4.3-liter 275-horsepower (S430) or a 5-liter 302-horsepower (S500) version. The 4.3 will transport the car to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds; the 5-liter in just 6.1 seconds.\n\nA five-speed electronic automatic transmission with manual shift capability.\n\nTurn-signals in the side mirrors to alert drivers and pedestrians of your intentions.\n\nEight air bags, two in the front, one in each door and a headliner-mounted side-curtain air-bag that protects your head from hitting the side glass. The seats will also detect the presence of a baby car seat.\n\nTraction control and anti-lock brakes to control wheel-spin. It is wrapped into an Electronic Stability Program that helps prevent slides by applying selective braking. This gives the car a rock-solid feel, going exactly where it’s pointed without a loss in traction.\n\nAutomatic head restraints pop up in the rear when rear seat passengers fasten their belts. A dash-mounted switch flops them down.\n\nThe car is suspended entirely by compressed air. A normal mode allows a bit of softness, for a traditional luxury car ride. A sport mode gives the car a firmer ride that eliminates body roll. Automatic damping adjusts the shocks to road conditions and vehicle load.\n\nA console mounted screen is home to the global positioning system that can guide you down the road of life. Integrated into this system is a voice-activated StarTAC cellular phone as well as audio system controls.\n\nAn SOS button that immediately contacts a help center which can dispatch emergency services. Through the GPS system, the help center can also tell the car’s model, color and location.\n\nAn information button works similarly, except that it’s for non-emergency use. This for helping the driver understand the use of the car. The owners manual is about 4 inches thick and comes with a CD-ROM tutorial.\n\nThe cruise control system uses a radar sensor to maintain proper following distance from the car in front of you, applying brakes if necessary.\n\nThe dual automatic climate control contains a sun sensor, that detects which side of the car the sun is hitting and adjusting the climate control accordingly, varying airflow on that side of the car.\n\nIf you just pop into a store for a quick errand, the climate control will recirculate heat from the engine to keep the car warm for up to 20 minutes.\n\nThe leather seats are both heated and air-conditioned. The seats’ venting is courtesy of 10 electric fans. In addition, the seats side-bolsters can be adjusted for width, and a massaging feature is available to prevent driver fatigue.\n\nThe Xenon gas-discharge headlamps dip down when turned on , to show what’s in front of the vehicle. Headlamp washers keep them clean.\n\nA charcoal filter switch closes all the windows and turns on the filter if you suddenly encounter a smelly problem on a summer day. The charcoal filter removes particles down to 5 microns.\n\nHolding down the unlock button not only unlocks the doors, but opens all the windows as well, the lock button closes them all.\n\nWhen the driver shuts off the car, it raises 1.7 inches for easier exiting. A dash switch can raise it another 0.8 inch.\n\nOnce the seats are adjusted, pushing the ergonomic button adjusts the rest of the seat options .\n\nA hand-held cell phone, stored in the center console and a part of the cell phone system, can be detached and taken with you.\n\nThere are four vanity mirrors, two up front, two in back. They contain two mirrors, regular and magnified.\n\nThe sound system adjusts for unwanted noise, such as an open window.\n\nThick, laminate d side glass and attention to door seals ensure an incredibly quiet interior.\n\nSo what’s it like to drive such a feature-laden, fast, solid, luxurious automobile?\n\nHeaven.\n\n>> 2000 Mercedes Benz S500\n\nVehicle type: Large 4-door luxury sedan\nEngines: 4.3-liter and 5-liter SOHC V-8\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\nWheelbase: 121.5 inches\nLength: 203.1 inches\nCurb weight: 4,133 pounds\nCargo volume: 15.4 cubic feet\nTires: P225/60R16H\nBase price, test model: $77,850\nAs tested: $83,005\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway\nTest mileage: 18 mpg\nFuel type: Premium\n>>",

      "expert_review": "The brute power, luxurious roominess and remarkable technology of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG 4Matic make it a superior — albeit expensive — choice among ultra-luxury full-size sedans.\n\nIt’s big news whenever Mercedes-Benz introduces a new S-Class. This is the automaker’s flagship model — the technology showcase, the opportunity for the company to show just what it can do. I had my first taste of the S-Class in Toronto, driving European-spec cars on a brief but impressive jaunt into the Ontario lakes district in late 2013. I declared that one does not so much drive the S-Class as operate it, due to its astonishing level of technological wizardry. But now I’ve just spent a week in a new 2014 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG — the range-topping high-performance model with an even more powerful engine, unique styling and enhanced athletic abilities. Like the S550, it’s received a significant update from its predecessor (compare the 2013 and 2014 S63 AMG here). Can adding a dose of power and flash turn the smooth-operating S550 into a driver’s performance car?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe S-Class always sets the styling theme for the rest of the lineup, and the new one is no exception. Its lines are already showing up in the new C-Class and CLA-Class, and likely will continue to proliferate throughout the Mercedes-Benz showroom. This is a good thing, as the S-Class is strikingly beautiful in person. It seems to stretch long and low, with a continuous arc forming a belt line for the car that’s sexy without losing the formality the S-Class embodies.\n\nThe S63 AMG receives some subtle changes, such as a more aggressive front bumper with bigger air scoops, larger matte-finish wheels, and gloss-black and matte-silver trim all around. The visual changes that turn the S550 into the S63 aren’t dramatic — one has to look for the AMG badges, but there’s no shortage of them, adorning everything from the wheels to the brakes to the exhaust tips. One can specify matte-finish wheels and paint to give the car a more menacing look, but the overall appearance changes are subtle.\n\nHow It Drives\nJust like the lesser S550 sedan, the S63 AMG is powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 engine that produces a massive 577 horsepower and 664 pounds-feet of torque — 41 hp more than last year’s model. That power goes through a standard seven-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels. Thanks to a dedicated effort to reduce the S63’s weight, the new model is 220 pounds lighter than last year’s car, and both performance and fuel economy have improved. Mercedes-Benz says the new S63 AMG can go from zero to 60 mph in just 3.9 seconds, topping out at an electronically limited 186 mph. Acceleration is positively explosive; just plant your foot and the huge Benz leaps forward with a muted roar. Too muted, frankly; the one thing missing from the S63 experience is a visceral soundtrack. The car doesn’t seem that much louder than its sedate S550 cousin, and it’s nothing like the snarling V-8 soundtrack in an SLS AMG coupe, for instance.\n\nIt won’t matter what the car sounds like for long, as the rapidly approaching horizon will quickly focus your attention on what you’re doing — and what you’re doing is having a lot of fun. The S63 is a big, cushy luxury car with a highly damped ride that doesn’t let many road imperfections into the cabin, with electric power steering that can be adjusted for a more sporty feel by switching from Comfort to Sport mode. The suspension and chassis have already received some sport-oriented changes over the S550, including a different front camber angle, a larger anti-roll bar and a stiffer subframe carrier for the rear axle. Lightweight 20-inch alloy wheels also help with the weight reduction and don’t negatively impact ride quality or noise despite their low-profile tires.\n\nThe changes result in a big sedan that can dance, although it’s not going to be mistaken for a true sports car anytime soon; it’s just too big for that. Perhaps the best improvement comes from the brakes — two-piece AMG lightweight units that haul the S63 down from high speed like someone popped a drag chute. Do too many of these rapid stops, and you risk spraining your neck — the brakes are that strong.\n\nFuel economy is respectable for such a big motor in a heavy car: 15/23/18 mpg city/highway/combined, with my week of aggressive driving netting just less than 19 mpg overall. It’s not exactly diesel territory, but it’s only marginally worse than its main competitors, including the all-wheel-drive BMW Alpina B7 (16/24/19 mpg) and the Audi S8 (15/26/19 mpg). Cylinder deactivation and a stop-start mode for the engine help keep fuel economy at merely cringe-worthy levels and out of the truly appalling range.\n\nInterior\nInside, it’s 21st century technology meets traditional wood-and-leather luxury. There’s a lot of space in the S63, and Mercedes uses it to good effect, with massive, highly bolstered and padded seats, some of the biggest and most comfortable automotive chairs I’ve ever parked myself in. They’re nearly infinitely adjustable and feature Mercedes-Benz’s active contour system, as well as heat, ventilation and several modes of massage.\n\nYour driving position and outward visibility are excellent despite the car’s high belt line. The backseats aren’t quite as fancy as the fronts, but they’re still immensely comfortable and offer plenty of legroom (this is a full-size Mercedes-Benz, after all). You can also specify an executive rear seat package for the backseat that turns it into a personalized lounge for true chauffeured comfort. The point of the S63 AMG, however, is to drive, not be driven.\n\nMaterials are all top-notch, with upgrades to the wood, leather, plastic and metal finishes in this latest generation S-Class that return the big Benz to its former status as a true top-tier luxury car. A dozen leather colors and patterns are available, with six wood and carbon-fiber trim options. The optional designo wood veneer in my test car was especially captivating. It took me a moment of staring to realize why I was gazing at it, only to realize it was because it changed depth along the dash from the doors to the center console, getting a darker stain as it approached the center of the car. It’s beautifully done and feels expensive. The only questionable style element of the interior was the metal grilles on the Burmester speakers, resembling as they did a shower drain. It smelled a little like a shower in there too — a fruity, soapy smell that I determined was coming from the optional fragrance canister in the glove box, which was linked into the cabin air purifier. You can choose from one of four “moods” to set the olfactory ambiance of your S-Class (or presumably use your favorite cologne to make it smell like Sex Panther or whatever other musk captures your fancy). The system can be switched off if you’d prefer your car to smell like a new Mercedes-Benz (generally my preference).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe most noticeable feature of the S63’s interior was the totally electronic dashboard. There are no gauges at all in the S-Class, just two massive screens stretching across the driver’s field of vision — blank at first, but firing up with high-definition clarity once the keyless ignition button is pushed. Simulated gauges behind the steering wheel can be lightly reconfigured with an AMG setting to display additional vehicle metrics, but given the totally electronic nature of the display systems, it’s surprising that it isn’t more customizable. An easy-to-use rotary controller on the center console is surrounded by buttons for major systems. It’s within easy reach, and after a few days of familiarization you won’t have to take your eyes off the road to find the button you want. Another row of buttons, controlling functions like climate control, are arranged in a single narrow band on the dash. The overall look is clean and uncluttered, but it may take awhile to learn.\n\nMercedes-Benz’ top-level Comand multimedia system is present, featuring navigation, voice controls, apps, a concierge service and more. An optional Splitview monitor even lets the front-seat passenger watch a DVD on the central display screen while preventing the driver from seeing it. All the vehicle’s systems and the central display can be controlled by a handheld remote control similar to a TV remote, usable from any seat in the car.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe S-Class may be a big car, but most of the space seems to have gone to passengers, as trunk space isn’t exactly copious. The S63 AMG offers up 16.3 cubic feet of luggage room in the trunk (the rear seats do not fold down), which is not as big as the BMW B7 Alpina’s 17.7 cubic feet but is considerably larger than the Audi S8’s 13.2 cubic feet. To put this size into context, a Chevrolet Impala has 18.8 cubic feet of trunk space while a Volkswagen Jetta has 15.5 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe new S-Class has not yet been crash-tested. Like all new Mercedes-Benz vehicles, the S63 and all S-Class models have a lengthy list of both passive and active safety features that range from mundane to astonishing, meant to protect both the car’s occupants and pedestrians who might encounter it on the street. The typical things are here, such as airbags and stability control, but so are some amazing features — like a night vision system with pedestrian detection that recognizes both two- and four-footed friends and outlines them in a red box on the night vision display. The S-Class’ adaptive LED headlights also have the ability to selectively flash in the face of an oncoming detected pedestrian’s — and only flash in their face — as the car approaches them, to warn them of the oncoming S63. The feature makes things like available lane departure warning, forward collision alert, automatic braking, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, lane keep assist and the host of other available systems seem almost mundane. Check out a list of the S63 AMG’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAll this technology does not come cheap. The regular S550 is already nearly a $100,000 car in the U.S., and stepping up to the S63 AMG 4Matic will cost you $140,425 including destination. My car had a few options, as well, including Night View Assist for $2,260, 10-spoke forged AMG wheels for $1,700, the designo exclusive trim package for $950, special wood trim for $800, the Splitview monitor for $710, the Warmth and Comfort Package for $2,600, a surround view camera for $900, the cabin air purification system with fragrance canister for $350, and the electronics-laden Driver Assistance Package for $2,800. Total cost including destination came to $153,495, which isn’t terribly far from Bentley Flying Spur territory.\n\nThe Bentley is still a bit more pricey than this, however, and might be a better competitor for the $167,825 V-12-powered Mercedes S600 sedan. The S63’s two primary competitors are also German. The top BMW 7 Series is the B7 Alpina, featuring its own turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine that comes up a little short in the horsepower department — 540 hp to the Benz’s 577 hp. Their starting prices are close, however, with the B7 starting at $132,225 with all-wheel drive (rear-wheel-drive and long-wheelbase versions are also available). The other option is the Audi S8, a sporting version of the A8 front-wheel-drive sedan. With standard quattro all-wheel drive, it sports the smallest engine of the three — a 520-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8. It’s the smallest and least-expensive car here, too, with a starting sticker of $113,395. You can compare all three competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: There’s a powerhouse luxury sedan under there somewhere, but the latest S-Class redesign has cloaked it below enough layers of technology and irritating interfaces to confound even the young.\n\nVersus the competition: The S580 nails some of the basics, but it struggles more than competitors to make its luxury-compulsory features accessible to users, and its backseat and trunk space feel curiously more in line with its tight turning circle than its considerable external size.\n\nThe key fob feels heavy and needlessly large. As you approach the stately Mercedes-Benz S580 sedan, the door handles — which spend most of their time retreated, flush with the door skins for the sake of aerodynamics — motor outward and present themselves. If it’s dark outside, Mercedes’ familiar three-pointed star projects crisply on the ground beside it. You tug the door open and take a seat, enveloped in the embrace and aroma of rich, quilted leather. With anticipation, you step on the brake pedal, press the Start/Stop button and say … WTF?!\n\nMark down 2021 as the year Mercedes-Benz went too far. I understand the compulsion to innovate in an attempt to top oneself and make a flagship sedan — arguably a flagship model — a technological groundbreaker. In the past, we’ve praised Mercedes for doing so skillfully, even naming a previous generation of the S-Class our Luxury Car of the Year — more than once. But this redesign is so complicated, so cloaked in touch-sensitive controls and interface complexity, even reviewers in their 30s, much less their 50s, consider it a technological misfire. How is an older driver, the sedan’s most likely buyer, going to deal with this?\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: It’s What’s Inside That Counts\n\nTruly, we sympathize. What we see here is a furtherance of the core intentions that kept previous S-Class generations in the lead. But this redesigned S-Class reminds me of countless other products — from apps to movie sequels — whose producers got so caught up trying to outdo their earlier successes that they lost touch with the end user: the customer. If the hero fought off 10 attackers with nothing but a spork in the first movie sequel, in the third installment, she’ll have to fend off 100 attackers with a bow and arrow while riding a motorcycle. And because the studio has already invested in the latest CGI technology, the film must employ it, meaning the attackers will have to be space aliens. Also, let’s make the motorcycle electric because everyone’s into electric right now. What’s overlooked in all of this, of course, is what alien invaders and electric two-wheelers have to do with the plot — or how the viewer will receive it.\n\nIf you think it sounds overwhelming to fight 100 aliens with a bow and arrow while riding a motorcycle, you’re on your way to understanding what it’s like to operate a new S-Class. I’ll dig into that momentarily, but first I’ll give this devil its due, because beneath the clutter the S-Class is a great car, and some of its innovations are indeed worthwhile.\n\nWhat Mercedes Got Right\n\nWithout question, the S580 we tested was a serenely quiet and comfortable car with mostly excellent ride quality. That said, a couple of our editors said harsh impacts from larger bumps found their way into the cabin’s otherwise floaty demeanor (and I use “floaty” as a positive in this era when practically every new vehicle rides firmly). It’s possible this characteristic was tied to our car’s 20-inch Hankook all-season tires, but it’s unlikely the 19-inch wheels would make a huge difference. Twenty-one-inch wheels are also available.\n\nIntroduced more than 20 years ago, Mercedes’ Active Body Control was one of the first active suspension systems to go beyond merely varying shock absorber firmness (though the S-Class does that, too). The company’s experience with the system shows in the S580’s ability to prevent its weight from shifting, disrupting handling. As an added bonus, the new E-Active Body Control system uses radar to sense an impending side collision and can raise the body up to 3 inches in a fraction of a second to improve crash protection.\n\nThe new generation improves handling even further with active rear steering, which can turn the rear wheels up to a remarkable 10 degrees in the opposite direction from the front wheels when traveling below 37 mph, for tighter cornering. It also makes for parking-lot maneuverability that’s remarkable given the sedan’s size, reducing the turning circle by 7 feet, Mercedes says. At higher speeds, all four wheels turn in the same direction for more stable lane changing. This technology isn’t new, but it’s finally finding a home here and in a couple of other current vehicles.\n\nTurbocharged and Electrically Boosted\n\nWe can’t argue with the S580’s powertrain: a dual-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine teamed with a nine-speed automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive. It generates 496 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. The car exhibits minimal accelerator lag, perhaps thanks to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system with an integrated starter-generator, which Mercedes says adds EQ Boost — 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque. The S580 does 0-60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, Mercedes says. Even from the isolation of a hushed cabin, it’s hard to doubt this estimate. We didn’t drive the S500, but I don’t think we’d find any arguments with its 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, 429 hp and 384 pounds-feet of torque, either. All other aspects of the powertrain, including the hybridization and EQ Boost, are the same. Mercedes estimates its 0-60 mph time at 4.8 seconds.\n\nMercedes was also early with augmented reality, and it’s very effective here in the S-Class, where blue arrows appear on the windshield’s head-up display, in the driver’s field of view, to indicate when and where to turn when navigation routing is active. It can also appear over a real-time video image on the central touchscreen. It’s so compelling, I didn’t rely on Android Auto, my go-to navigation option, which is standard along with Apple CarPlay, but neither supports AR functionality. The HUD itself is quite large, and one can imagine future Benzes will put these prompts anywhere on the windshield, but this system for now is among the best — if you can bear the control interface that initiates it.\n\nAudio You Feel, or Don’t\n\nThe Burmester premium audio system, which sounds very good indeed, has a neat trick called 4D Sound that incorporates a transducer (the part of a speaker that makes it move) into each seat, vibrating them just like a good deep-bass subwoofer would vibrate the whole car. The result is quite effective, and adjustable. I found it pretty strong at its lowest levels, but the higher levels are probably useful compensating for bulky winter outerwear. What’s the point of this feature? It gives a visceral kick one “listener” might want without afflicting other occupants. I believe a good full-range audio system is felt as well as heard — I even once had a transducer attached to my couch for home theater use — so I’m on board with this could-be gimmick.\n\nWe had some issues with features enabled by the driver-facing camera. The camera has several purposes, including drowsiness detection and even facial recognition, but one novel use is that the camera can detect when you’re looking left or right, so you don’t have to press a Left or Right button before adjusting either side mirror; the car knows which one you’re looking at. Pressing a button isn’t a lot of work, and I can’t tell you why I think facial recognition in a car is pointless and this add-on feature is clever, but I do.\n\nThe car’s many camera views are both dazzling and useful. A view of a vehicle from the perspective of an observer standing several feet away (or slowly circling it, as we’ve seen for a few years now from Lexus and other brands) was once a mind-melting bit of digital trickery, and now it’s even higher-quality — and more legitimately valuable when it’s trying to protect the S-Class from obstacles.\n\nHowever, the graphics superimposed on the image to indicate both the proximity of barriers and the line the wheels will follow when turned (all four, remember) occasionally hindered my attempts to protect vulnerable rims from curbs. I’m confident there’s a way to turn these lines off, but in this car, doing even something you know is possible can be so frustrating, you may not even try it. (We’ll get to the problems in a moment.) One puzzling camera perspective is the forward-facing Traffic Light View, which shows the intersection well when waiting at a red light — but the traffic lights themselves are so tiny you can barely see when they turn green … unless you look out the window.\n\nWhere Mercedes Went Wrong\n\nThere’s a difference between complex and complicated: A luxury vehicle must be complex in order to compete, but it needn’t be complicated. To be clear — and fair — we realize that a steep learning curve is not the same thing as frustrating day-to-day usability. Intuitive operation is optimal but not strictly necessary. Once you learn the ropes, even a complex system can be painless to operate, and we’re always willing to don the climbing gear and scale a steep learning curve before drawing conclusions. Unfortunately, after summiting Mount S-Class Learning Curve, we found aggravating usability at the top.\n\nThe bottom of the car’s 12.8-inch central touchscreen is occupied by a relatively stable set of ventilation controls, but above them is a smattering of icons with no hierarchy or logic. Once you tap and delve deeper, some of the menus start making more sense and do a decent job of reflecting the current settings without making you tap even further. Finding your way back to these feature settings the next time you need them, however, always seems a challenge. The MBUX system, as it’s called, also includes voice control, but I’ve never let that serve as an excuse for poor execution of a car’s primary usability doorway — and I didn’t find the “Hey, Mercedes” experience to be any more intuitive or efficient overall here than it is in other vehicles.\n\nTouchscreen menu design is always difficult; button design needn’t be, and this is where the S-Class disappoints the most. Off-screen, it relies too much on touch-sensitive panels in lieu of conventional mechanical buttons, which both personal experience and studies show owners don’t care for. It’s a technology that seldom works as well as the tried-and-true button, and it’s particularly susceptible to changes in humidity and glove use. In the S-Class, there are touch-sensitive components below the touchscreen, on the armrest and door-panel controls, and even in the form of a gutter in the overhead console through which you’re meant to run your finger to open the moonroof. Perhaps most frustrating are the touch-sensitive segments on the steering-wheel spokes, which provide directional and press-to-enter control over both the 12.3-inch instrument panel display and the central touchscreen — whether you intend them to or not.\n\nBelieve me when I tell you a simpler car that’s irritating to control, like the Volkswagen ID.4, is bad enough. A car that can do as much as this one — some of which it will do without your asking and you’ll want to stop — and is also irritating to control is exponentially worse.\n\nYet another casualty of the touch-sensitive controls (no, I’m not finished yet) is that they wipe out one of the ways brands like Mercedes used to impart luxury: through the look and feel of high-quality knobs and buttons. Now, the exclusive knurled-metal finish and fine snick-snick-snick of a precision dial or thumbwheel is replaced by the same smudge and fingerprint gallery you’ll find on a growing number of entry-level vehicles. Every increase in piano-black and touchscreen real estate — impressive though it be at a glance — comes at the expense of some other opportunity, be it a brand-exclusive material, a control or another touchpoint.\n\nThe Tyranny of the Six Dots\n\nI didn’t include among the car’s pluses its large, color instrument panel display for two reasons: One, I saw its three-dimensional effect first in a $28,400 Kia K5 in 2020, and two, it similarly collapsed to two dimensions because my preferred position for the seat and tilt steering wheel blocked the driver-facing camera. Unfortunately, even though I didn’t care about the 3D, the car didn’t like not being able to see my eyes and kept posting warnings on the instrument panel telling me to adjust the seat or wheel until I could see six sequential dots on the display, which looked like landing lights.\n\nLarge Outside, Less So Inside\n\nComfortable though the S-Class is, complete with neck pillows that drew disproportionate praise, it’s not as roomy as some competitors. It now offers some of the same features I enthused about in a video on the 2017 BMW 7 Series — at the time our Luxury Car of the Year — such as an integrated, removable touchscreen tablet that serves as a remote control for the backseat, as well as a motorized ottoman for the curbside passenger back there. The difference is that I, at 6 feet tall, didn’t have room to stretch out on it like I did in the 7 Series and the current Lexus LS 500 sedan, which both have a similar feature. For what it’s worth, those models are about 2 inches shorter, bumper to bumper, than the S-Class. So did the extra space go to the trunk?\n\nUnfortunately, no; the S580’s trunk isn’t very large, either. Based on manufacturer specifications, it has 12.9 cubic feet, which is roughly 4 to 5 cubic feet less than the other models mentioned with the roomier backseats. Because we’re dubious of manufacturer-supplied specifications, Cars.com performs its own cargo measurements. Though our trunk-measuring methodology always yields higher numbers, we also found the S580’s trunk to be small in context. We haven’t measured any of the S-Class’ direct competitors yet, but a 2021 BMW 540i mid-size sedan’s trunk had 17.9 cubic feet, better than the 17.4 cubic feet we measured in the full-size S580.\n\nIt’s possible the space is lost to the S-Class’ available and exclusive backseat frontal airbags, which deploy from the front seatbacks. Those also explain why the ottoman emerges from down low rather than dropping down as in the 7 Series.\n\nThe Luxury Factor\n\nThis is the point where we usually ask, and attempt to answer, if you should buy the subject of the review. If the S-Class weren’t a luxury car, I think it’s less likely shoppers would buy it, but luxury throws a giant variable into the mix. People assign value to some brands over others, and that varies from person to person. There are those who will always buy a Mercedes just because it’s a Mercedes, and even accept what they dislike about it — or repress it — because they believe the brand represents something.\n\nTouchscreens are probably the best option for managing the amazing adjustability of modern vehicles (and we can hope automakers use their newly deployed over-the-air update functionality to improve how they operate). But we reject the notion that touch-sensitive buttons are a necessity, much less an inevitability. For what it’s worth, Mercedes officials have made it clear they won’t be backing down on their use of touch-sensitive controls. They believe it’s the future, or at least their brand’s future. I believe it’s an enormous mistake. The technology isn’t inherently young or futuristic as some will attempt to convince you; it’s just inferior.\n\nAs always, I recommend shoppers think for themselves. The 2022 S500 starts at $112,150 and the S580 at $118,750 (prices include a $1,050 destination charge). If you don’t like the redesigned S-Class’ interface, or anything else about the car, you probably ought to trust your gut. If you shell out this kind of money assuming you’ll get used to the S-Class’ tricky operation because the people at Mercedes-Benz must be smarter than you, well, they probably are.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n6 Crazy Features on the 2021 Mercedes-Maybach S-Class\nTalk About Spending the Night!

      "expert_review": "Is the Mercedes-Benz S580e a Good Luxury Sedan?\n\nSmooth, elegant, comfortable, luxurious and featuring great all-electric range, the Mercedes-Benz S580e plug-in hybrid is still a benchmark — but it’s a harder sell than it once was thanks to its overly fussy screens, touch-sensitive controls and tricky electronics. \n\nHow Does the Mercedes-Benz S580e Compare With Other Luxury Sedans?\n\nTechnology has trumped actual luxury in every luxury brand’s flagship sedan, so the S580e isn’t any harder to use than a BMW 7 Series, Audi A8 or Lexus LS — and it beats them all when it comes to cachet.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been an icon of luxury for decades, and its cachet, presence and reputation for solidity, quality, exclusivity and a bunch of other -itys keep it squarely atop the luxury flagship sedan class. It’s the luxury flagship every other automaker aims for but few have been able to catch. Increasingly, though, Mercedes-Benz has been making choices with its luxury vehicles that many folks find questionable — notably, the choice to promote technology as luxury. The company has loaded its SUVs and cars — especially the S-Class — with tons of multimedia offerings, controls, functions, screens and features that are difficult to learn, confusing to use and distracting in the extreme. The 2025 S-Class, which we drove in S580e plug-in hybrid form, is the latest example of this push. It begs the question: Has favoring tech over traditional luxury cues ruined the premier flagship luxury sedan or augmented it? And, on a separate note, how does the S580e work as a plug-in hybrid?\n\nRelated: 2023 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Plug-In Debuts Latest Hybrid System, Starts at $123K\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cost?\n\nSix versions of the Germany-built S-Class sedan are offered for the 2025 model year in the United States, including a choice of powertrains, a sporty AMG version and super-luxe Maybach trims. Unlike BMW, however, which offers a fully electric powertrain in its 7 Series, called the i7, if you want a full-on electric-only powertrain in a Mercedes-Benz luxury sedan, you have to switch to a totally different model, the EQS. All the following prices for the S-Class lineup include a surprisingly reasonable $1,150 destination fee.\n\nS500 4Matic: $118,900\nS580e 4Matic PHEV: $129,350\nS580 4Matic: $129,750\nAMG S63 E Performance: $187,350 \nMaybach S580 4Matic: $204,650\nMaybach S680 4Matic: $241,650\n\nThe biggest difference between the models, which all come standard with all-wheel drive, is what powers them. The base engine in the S500 is a turbocharged inline-six-cylinder gasoline engine making 442 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque. The S580e is a plug-in hybrid that also uses a turbocharged inline-six engine, as well as an electric motor and a large 22.7-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. The setup offers up to 48 miles of all-electric range before the gas engine kicks in, producing a total of 503 hp and 553 pounds-feet of torque. The regular S580 swaps the hybrid stuff for a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 making 496 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque, while the potent AMG S63 E Performance adds a big electric motor out back to help boost output to a stunning 791 hp and 1,055 pounds-feet of torque. If coddling is a bigger priority than blistering speed, the Maybach models come with an extended wheelbase. The Maybach S580 uses the same V-8 as the lesser S580, and the granddaddy luxury flagship Maybach S680 has a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 making a buttery-smooth 621 hp and 664 pounds-feet of torque. Choose your preference — all it takes is money.\n\nPlug It In, Plug It In\n\nThe plug-in hybrid powertrain in my S580e test vehicle means it can be used in a number of ways: as a pure-electric vehicle with a range of up to 48 miles, as a gas-electric hybrid that will decide for itself how to blend its power sources, or as a gas-powered vehicle with electric assist, which happens mostly in its Sport modes but also when the battery runs dry. \n\nUpon startup, the S580e sticks to electric-only mode unless you switch out of it. It drives beautifully as an EV, with decent acceleration (so long as you don’t ask for full power) and smooth, silent operation. Its regenerative braking can be adjusted, too. \n\nOperating the S580e is a mixed bag. As long as it stays in electric mode, it’s lovely. It’s still good when in its gas mode, though the nine-speed automatic transmission feels easily confused, often hunting for gears and being slow to kick down when big acceleration is called for, such as entering a highway or attempting a passing maneuver. But it’s during transitions between gas and electric power that the S580e really falters, delaying activation of the gas engine for so long it creates situations where you need big acceleration but find yourself waiting on the gas engine to help provide it. There’s no shortage of power in the S580e, just a curious method of delivering it. It’s annoying to the point that the car’s less powerful but smoother all-electric mode is preferable. \n\nThe rest of the S580e driving experience is pure Mercedes-Benz S-Class opulence. The ride is beautifully controlled thanks to a standard air suspension and adaptive dampers, soaking up bumps and frost heaves as if they weren’t even there. The steering is as video-game numb as expected in a luxo-barge like this, but it’s accurate and direct, and my test vehicle’s optional rear-wheel steering made for super-easy parking-lot maneuvers thanks to a tightened turning circle. It feels like a smaller car when you’re driving it thanks to that boost in maneuverability; it’ll make you wish all big cars and SUVs came with rear-axle steering. Visibility out is decent — better than you’ll find in the all-electric EQS, which features cab-forward styling and a super-high dashboard. The brakes, however, have a non-linear feel that varies depending on which drive mode the car is in and how much brake regen you’ve requested. \n\nThe S580e feels luxurious, beautifully isolated and sophisticated in its body control and operation. It delivered on its 48 miles of estimated electric range, which we achieved at highway speeds with the air conditioning running full tilt due to the muggy summer heat. That means that around town, in regular stop-and-go city traffic, the S580e’s electric range is probably quite underrated; we bet it could go much farther on electrons if driven carefully. It feels expensive from behind the wheel, delivering an experience worthy of its flagship status.\n\nToo Much Tech, Not Enough Luxury\n\nThe problem with the S580e is the way it confuses technology for luxury, which is something we’ve experienced in many German luxury vehicles of late and is a trend that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. Almost all controls are located in the vehicle’s touchscreen multimedia system, including the climate controls and vehicle settings. It’s difficult to assess and use at a glance, though the more you live with it, the more you’ll learn where everything is. Still, the typical S-Class buyer might not be able to use half of this stuff due to how confusing it is and will probably not see the value in the other half of it. \n\nA perfect example of this is the optional 3D gauge cluster that my test vehicle featured. At the push of an icon on the multimedia screen, some magic happens, and the gauge screen in front of you takes on a funky 3D effect. It’s a little bit cool and a lot unnerving and distracting; I ended up using the normal 2D mode most of the time to avoid getting a headache. Would I call this a luxurious feature, or merely technology meant to boost this car’s visual wow factor? The same thing must be asked of the multicolored ambient lighting throughout the S-Class’ interior, which can be set anywhere between a subtle glow and a full-on Las Vegas party bus. And how about its still-awful touch-sensitive steering wheel controls? It all feels like development money that could’ve been better spent on some nicer buttons, controls and materials throughout the cabin.\n\nMercedes-Benz would remind you that most of this car’s controls and systems are also voice-activated, from your choice of entertainment to the temperature of the cabin, but I’ve yet to meet anyone who actually wants to talk to their car. And sometimes people can’t talk to their cars, like when passengers in the vehicle are having conversations. And heaven forbid you actually say the word “Mercedes” in that conversation, because it will trigger the voice-command function. There are several staffers at Cars.com who immediately switch off the voice-command system in every new Mercedes-Benz test vehicle upon receipt because of how intrusive and interruptive it is. \n\nThe materials quality in the S580e is acceptable but no longer truly impressive. Many panels feel hollow and thin, just like in the EQS, and the S-Class no longer has that bank-vault solidity that prior generations enjoyed. The shapes are modern and pleasing, however, with a sculpted dash and an interesting layout for things like headlight controls, which are found on the driver’s door. I don’t mind the stalk-mounted shifter at all, as it frees up cupholder and storage space in the center console. The wood in there is real wood, the metal is metal, and that’s definitely real leather you’re sitting on. One of the reasons the S-Class in general is more expensive than its competitors is the variety of interior materials you have to choose from, with many color palettes, trim choices and other personalization options to make the vehicle yours. \n\nThe backseat of the S580e is just as nice a place to be as the front, with plenty of space to stretch out, copious headroom (despite the panoramic moonroof), and all the luxury touches one would expect this side of a Maybach-style limousine. Good luck finding the cupholders in the backseat, though; we had to consult online resources after our on-site search couldn’t turn them up. Turns out they’re in the fold-down center console, but they’re very difficult to engage; they seem like an afterthought. A car like this is often used to shuttle VIPs and captains of industry, so it’s odd that Mercedes made such a simple feature so difficult to use.\n\nThere’s a decent amount of trunk space in the S580e, as well, but not as much as you get in non-PHEV versions of the S-Class. That big 22.7-kWh battery pack had to go somewhere, and it appears that under the backseat and into the trunk is where it went. Even so, the trunk still has more than enough space for luggage or cargo.\n\nIs It Worth It?\n\nThe latest version of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, in PHEV form, is still one of the top flagship luxury sedans you can buy today. My test vehicle rang in at $144,260, including options like the 3D gauge package, a Night Package with black-out trim, 20-inch wheels, rear-axle steering and more. The S580e is still opulent, still as silent and coddling as a proper luxury car should be, and still striking to behold and use. But Mercedes’ push to put more and more technology of questionable utility into the S-Class — where it’s foisted upon buyers who are not historically the most tech savvy — seems it will either have to peak soon, or a demographic shift will need to bring new buyers with different ideas about what constitutes proper luxury. The question as to whether Mercedes-Benz is prescient or going too far, too fast, will be answered by the sales numbers. \n\nIf you can handle the tech and are OK with spending a considerable amount of time learning how to use your new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the S580e is a formidable choice. It’s still one of the most comfortable vehicles on the planet, and it will command a choice spot at the valet stand regardless of where you are. \n\nMore Mercedes-Benz News From Cars.com: \n\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance a Good Car? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Much Is the 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n2026 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Wagon Priced From $94,500\nMercedes-Benz Reveals All-New, Electric 2027 GLC With EQ Technology\n2025 Mercedes-Benz E450 All-Terrain Review: Wearing Your Dress Shoes On a Hike\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mike Jackson, senior vice president of marketing and sales for Mercedes-Benz of North America, was saying that while sales are down, marketing hopes are up.\n\nThe glimmer in the recession, he told a breakfast muster of Los Angeles automotive writers, came with recent reports that the rich seem to be getting richer. More disposable income, theorized Jackson, should mean more buyers for Mercedes’ new S-Class luxury sedans.\n\nCame a question from the floor: Fiscal studies may talk of bigger and more available bucks, but what of social studies that indicate the mortal wounding of materialism and an end to wearing diamond drops at Laker games?\n\n“There is an element of that at play,” Jackson responded. “But for us, we like to think a Mercedes represents intrinsic value, not a frivolous purchase.”\n\nBut intrinsic value, it should be noted, obtained only at enormous cost. And the average price of a Mercedes these days is around $60,000.\n\nLeast expensive among the new S-Class, traditionally reserved for Mercedes’ thoroughbred four-doors, is the 1992 300SE, which sells for a mere $69,400. Piddling, indeed, alongside the 600SEL, a velvet grizzly that costs $141,200, including gas guzzler and luxury taxes.\n\nYet if anything is truly frivolous, it could well be our habit of gawking at price tags and making comparisons rooted in our Ford Escorts and worries about the next payment.\n\nTruth is, a Mercedes is best considered–and certainly better understood–from the fat and fortunate perch of bluebloods who own several cars for a variety of purposes. They don’t carry cash, their summer homes are remodelled Colonial farmhouses in Wilton, Conn., and checking their oil means examining yesterday’s closing price for Arco stock.\n\nIn such context, the big Mercedes-Benz, built like a brick omnibus, is one of the finest cars in the world.\n\nIt has almost the luxury with much less the length and bulk of a Bentley.Mercedes technology maximizes safety without reducing aggressive driving pleasures. Curb weights are measured in tons, but the performance figures will split seconds with most sports cars.\n\nThe 1992 S-Class–six years in the creation and the first redesign of the super sedan series in 12 years–is typically arrogant. Also a little excessive, an unabashed glutton for gasoline and a family car only in the sense that Hearst Castle might be considered a tract home. Had the German army made it across the English Channel in 1939, these are the cars Rolls-Royce would be building today.\n\nThe S-Klasse is a line of five cars, although one, the turbocharged diesel 300SD, has already choked on California emission standards and will not be sold here. For local audiences, that still leaves the 3.2-liter 300SE with the in-line six gasoline engine; the 400SE with a 4.2-liter V-8; the longer wheelbase 500SEL with the 5.0-liter V-8, and the gross indulgence of that 600SEL powered by a 6.0-liter V-12 that’s good for a 155 m.p.h. ride to bankruptcy court.\n\nAs a group, they are wider, taller and roomier than the sedans they succeed. But also shorter, more streamlined and noticeably plainer. That visual restraint was achieved by reducing the amount of chrome and external trim while softening the edges and angles so typically Mercedes. Even the radiator grille is smaller now, set flush with the lowered nose of the car and raked gently to the rear.\n\nBut the broad-shouldered, flat-bellied look of Mercedes, with its promise of whispering performance and elegant travel, survives.\n\nOur pick of the class was the 282-horsepower 400SE with full leather interior and a broad spread of walnut facings that must have felled a small copse and at least seven cows.\n\nThis is a familiar place. The seats are small thrones, the gearshift knob the size of a baby’s fist, and the headlights are still on a turn switch. Those things worked so well in thepa t that there simply has been no call to reconfigure them.\n\nEvery desired button, lever and toggle is where the eye or hand first explores. That’s where they have been for the last 20 years. That’s where they will remain as long as Mercedes believes familiarity breeds response in event of an emergency.\n\nFlaws are hard to find in such an interior. Maybe the seat-belt receptacle should be a little higher to reduce an annoying grope between seat and console. Possibly the brake release handle in the dash could be illuminated for night work. But that’s reaching far to pick microscopic nits.\n\nThe 400SE–as with all S-Class cars–is an environmentally correct showcase of the future. Despite an enormous thirst for premium unleaded that clearly is at odds with such a statement, the car comes with the motoring world’s first air-conditioning system that does not use ozone-melting fluorocarbons. There’s also a charcoal filter in the ventilation system to cleanse lumps from incoming smog and an electrostatic filter to block dust, pollen and aromas from Spago.\n\nAs for gadgets, this car is Alice in Deutschland.\n\nOne button adjusts not just side but also rearview mirrors. It then flattens the side mirrors against the car before parking-lot wanderers flatten them for real.\n\nCan’t see out the back window? One touch lowers the rear headrests. Auntie and her bottle of Chablis getting baked in the back seats? Another button raises a mesh sunscreen to block rays through the rear window.\n\nThe front armchairs have bun warmers, orthopedic backrests and 12-way power adjustments. Also, three memories of seat positions for foolish folk who might allow someone other than the owner and a constant companion to drive.\n\nThe air-conditioning system is automatic with dual controls and thermostats for front riders, with the option of a second set of split climate controls for back seaters. The 11 speakers of the Bose Beta sound system are balanced to present identical sound levels to all four corners.\n\nSide glass is double insulated–just like the storm windows of our frozen adolescence–to keep climate in and noises out. There’s a driver’s side air bag, of course, also a passenger’s side air pillow installed in the dash without losing the glove box.\n\nShort wands rise from the rear corners of the car when it’s in reverse; these vertical curb feelers keep fenders safe during parking maneuvers. And pneumatics assist when closing doors and the trunk lid. Sheesh, Mercedes even puts fuzzy linings in its cup holders.\n\nEnormous pull from its V-8 engine with four cams and 32 valves is quite enough to overcome the bulk of the 400SE. Just as surprising, the car is relatively nimble and at no time feels like it weighs 2 1/2 tons and stretches more than 16 feet.\n\nSee it as the perfect Rottweiler. It stands broad and statuesque and has insouciant moves. But poke it in the ribs and hang on a s raw power explodes and the scenery starts to blur.\n\nThe anti-lock brakes are disc, huge and would stop a Humvee on a dinar. A multilink suspension with the obligatory and independent combination of coils, shocks and anti-roll bars, allows the car to perform without a whisper of squat during acceleration or dive during braking. Even body wobbles, a given on a car this size, only go so far before suspension geometry stops them short.\n\nThese, however, are engineering systems virtually hand-built by world craftsmen working with few restraints on component costs. Mercedes allows similar splurging on the very best in wheels, tires, leathers, woods, vinyls, every accessory and all materials. To cut corners is to reduce quality, to lessen one car is to lower the image of the entire line.\n\nThe end result is very expensive motor cars.\n\nSome observers feel that Mercedes could well be pricing itself out of the U.S. market. Automotive writers read shadows ofcorp rate concern in Mercedes presentations that have started to acknowledge the lesser-priced competition of Lexus, Infiniti and even the new Cadillac Seville.\n\nAnd nobody missed Jackson’s Freudian slip during the Los Angeles introduction of the S-Class.\n\nHe extolled the cars for quality and customer satisfaction and their reputation for being”unique, extinct . . . er, exclusive and distinct.”\n\n1992 Mercedes-Benz 400SE\n\nThe Good Total luxury and damn the expense.

      "expert_review": "Here in the wine country of Styria, it’s late September and the weather is balmy, the sky free of clouds and brilliant blue. The air is so clear, you easily can see the mountains in nearby Slovenia.\n\nThe Austrians call this pleasant autumnal weather alt weiber summer – “old woman” summer – supposedly because the gossamer spider webs spun at this time of year resemble fine strands of silver hair.\n\nYou can stop at a roadside shack and buy hot chestnuts, fresh roasted pumpkin seeds and the first pressings of young wine from the local vineyards on Wein Strasse (Wine Street).\n\nI can think of few more picturesque places to drive the redesigned Mercedes-Benz S class, the flagship of the German automaker’s line. On this trek, I share driving chores with my Hamburg colleague, Joachim Staat, an editor with Auto Bild, Europe’s largest weekly automotive publication.\n\nStaat is good enough to explain everything from the local colloquialisms to the inner workings of the Mercedes, which won’t reach U.S. dealerships until spring. He’s been fiddling all morning with the controls on the fancy audio/navigation system on our S430, trying to make the radio work. “I think we’ve broken it,” he finally says in frustration. No matter. There are plenty of other gizmos and gadgets to keep you occupied in the S class.\n\nThey include:\n\n* Distronic intelligent autonomous cruise control, which automatically keeps the car at a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.\n\n* Airmatic adaptive intelligent ride control, which combines air suspension with adaptive shocks that automatically adjust to road conditions, payload and the driver’s own operating characteristics.\n\n* Keyless Go system on a pocket-size “smart” card that requires no key to automatically unlock the driver’s door and start the car.\n\n* Command cockpit management and data system, which combines radio, CD changer, cellular phone and onboard navigation system, and includes a color display in the center console and multi-function buttons on the steering wheel. A Tele-Aid emergency call system also is included.\n\n* Dynaps dynamic auto pilot system that takes traffic jams into account when programming a vehicle route via the satellite navigation system.\n\nThere are, of course, loads more goodies on the S class, including heated power seats with active ventilation (there’s a fan inside) and “magic fingers” that can massage a tired spine and back muscles.\n\nEven without all that whiz-bang technology, the S class would be noteworthy in one other respect: It is one of the safest production cars in the world.\n\nStandard features include no less than eight air bags. There are frontal bags for driver and passenger, and the passenger bag automatically adjusts for vehicle speed and impact severity, and includes a child-seat detector. There are also side-impact bags in each of the four doors, and window bags that extend nearly the entire length of the cab in to protect occupants’ heads.\n\nIn addition, the S class employs the usual array of sophisticated electronic equipment to keep the vehicle as stable and secure as possible, including anti-lock brakes with automatic assist, and an electronic stability program to keep the rear wheels from sliding or “fishtailing” on slippery pavement.\n\nI tease Staat that you almost need a pilot’s license these days to operate an S class because there are so many dials and controls to contend with. Indeed, it takes us several moments to figure out that the central locking switch is not on either door, but in a long line of similar switches mounted across the dashboard.\n\nDespite its sleek shape and snazzy ellipsoid headlamps, the new S class doesn’t look as substantial as its predecessor. There’s a good reason. Overall length and width have been trimmed, and Mercedes has taken from 475 to 660 pounds out of the various S-class models, substituting lots of aluminum, plastic and high-stren lightweight steel in place of conventional steel to cut weight.\n\nThere was such a hue and cry in Europe over the ponderous size and mass of the previous S class when it was introduced in 1991, I’m not surprised Mercedes was a bit sensitive in this regard. The company says the lower mass of the new model results in an impressive reduction in fuel consumption of 13 percent to 17 percent.\n\nThe diet also has worked wonders for the car’s road manners. The S class feels considerably more lively and agile on these twisty European roads than the previous generation. The new 4.3-liter V-8 in the S430, rated at 279 horsepower in European trim, is gratifyingly responsive, especially in combination with the five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.\n\nThe suspension system also is impressive, providing a surprisingly satisfying combination of control and ride comfort that was not apparent in the old car. Fitted with speed-sensitive power steering, the S class hugs corners tightly, with almost no body roll, and brakes smoothly and assuredly with little evidence of dive. The result is a poise that is uncommon in a car in the ultra-luxury class.\n\nWhen the S class arrives in North America, it likely will be offered in two V-8 variants -; the S430 and S500 – with the 12-cylinder S600 returning at the top of the range.\n\nThere’s no word yet from Mercedes-Benz of North America on how much, if any, prices will go up. We’ll probably have to wait until after the first of the year for the definitive word there.\n\nLongtime S-class owners in the United States also will have to bide their time before discovering if the latest edition of “der Grosser Mercedes” has enough substance – and perhaps a tad too many gadgets – for their taste.",

      "expert_review": "Few things are more frustrating than being stuck in traffic in a car as fine and fast as this week’s subject automobile, the 2009 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG high-performance sedan.\n\nIt’s a cruel joke.\n\nYou are trapped in a car with a base price of $131,350, surrounded by substantially less-expensive metal. Neither you nor your fellow motorists are going anywhere fast. More often than not, you aren’t even moving.\n\nBut you are paying a bigger penalty. In city traffic, your S63 AMG averages 11 miles per gallon. Please note the word “averages.” In traffic jams, frequent occurrences in cities such as the District and New York, you get even less. And that’s in a car that requires premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nHighway mileage isn’t much better at an average of 17 miles per gallon, which falls considerably lower than that on roads such as the Capital Beltway and Interstate 95 south near the Springfield Mixing Bowl, aggravating swirls of concrete that seem more designed for parking cars than speeding them along to their destinations.\n\nI neither expect nor solicit sympathy here. Anyone who can buy a car priced well in excess of $100,000 shouldn’t complain about the cost of fueling it. I understand. But that isn’t the point.\n\nIt’s the real-world infringement on automotive fantasies that upsets me. It’s like being brutally awakened from a pleasant dream — over and over again, with happiness promised but seldom delivered.\n\nThe S63 AMG is one of the world’s most beautiful, best-engineered automobiles — a rear-wheel-drive sedan endowed with a 6.3-liter V-8 engine that develops a maximum 518 horsepower and 465 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThat’s a lot of oomph! In this case, it’s oomph accompanied by the romance of hand-built craftsmanship. That engine is lovingly, painstakingly, manually assembled — piece by piece — by skilled tradesmen at AMG, the Mercedes-Benz high-performance group.\n\nThe acronym reflects the surnames of the engineering partners who founded the group — Hans Werner Aufrecht (A) and Erhard Melcher (M) — in Aufrecht’s hometown of Grossaspach (G), Germany.\n\nAMG, now located in the German town of Affalterbach, began life as AMG Engine Production and Development in 1967 in a world much different from the one we inhabit today. There was little talk of global warming back then. Speeds on Germany’s Autobahn were mostly unrestricted, even near urban centers. Automotive journalists worldwide hungered for a chance to get to Germany to drive a top car at top speed on the world’s finest, fastest highway.\n\nThose days are gone. Nowadays, the easiest way to get a pricey traffic ticket in Germany is to ignore speed limits near urban areas. Lawbreakers will be photographed, found and fined.\n\nNow, there are tough environmental laws reflected in levies on automobiles whose tailpipes emit more carbon dioxide and other smog-causing pollutants than the law allows.\n\nIn the United States, a car such as the S63 AMG is freighted with a $3,000 federal gas-guzzler tax at new-car purchase. Also, there is a potential social cost, such as the reactive opprobrium served up by the economically frugal, the unemployed and otherwise job-threatened in a frighteningly troubled economy, and the environmentally righteous.\n\nIt all sort of takes the joy out of sitting behind the wheel of a sumptuously leathered automobile such as the S63 AMG — sort of.\n\nThe human spirit is wondrously vulnerable to seduction. There is a degree of greed and lust in all of us. There is an itch we must scratch, if it is at all possible for us to do so and get away with it.\n\nThe world turns on such desire. Empires rise and fall because of it. It generates our poetry, novels, theater, music, dance and fine art. News organizations could not exist without it.\n\nSo, it is in celebration of Grand Desire, the possibility of fulfilling it on some lonely road for however brief a moment, that, despite its many real-world limitations, I toast the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG high-performance sedan. Here’s to one hell of a car!",

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz offers several all-electric vehicles as part of its EQ sub-brand, including the EQS and EQB SUVs and EQS Sedan — a battery-powered counterpart to the brand’s flagship S-Class sedan. Shoppers that want the efficiency of an EV with the range serenity of a gas-powered engine can now find it in the plug-in hybrid variant of the S-Class: Last offered in the previous-generation 2020 S560e, the S580e returns for 2023 as the most powerful S-Class outside of the high-performance AMG line.\n\nRelated: 2021-22 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Review: A Maestro Shrouded by Tech\n\nNew PHEV Brings HP Bump\n\nWhile the standard 2023 S580 is powered by a turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the S580e shares a turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder with the S500. The six-cylinder is paired with a 21.5-kilowatt-hour battery and an electric motor for a total system output of 510 horsepower and 553 pounds-feet of torque; Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system comes standard.\n\nThe PHEV’s automaker-estimated specs improve upon the S580’s 496 hp and 516 pounds-feet, but its 0-60 mph sprint takes 5.1 seconds — slightly longer than the S580’s 4.4 seconds. According to Mercedes, the S580e is more agile thanks to the electric motor’s instantly available peak torque of 369 pounds-feet.\n\nAdditionally, Mercedes’ E-Active Body Control air suspension system will be available. The system prevents the sedan’s weight from shifting, which was a highlight of the 2022 S-Class’ driving experience. As a bonus, it also offers added protection in an impending side-impact crash by raising the vehicle body slightly.\n\nAll-Electric Range and Charging\n\nMercedes says the new PHEV’s all-electric range has more than doubled compared to the previous model. Based on the EPA-rated 19 miles, shoppers should expect around 40 miles of all-electric range. Note, however, that Mercedes has only offered range estimates based on European testing requirements, which typically fall short of U.S. estimates, and the S580e has not been EPA-rated.\n\nWhen it comes to charging, the sedan gets a standard 9.6-kilowatt charger, while an available 60-kW DC fast charger can bring the battery from 10% to 80% charge in 20 minutes, according to the automaker’s estimates.\n\nFamiliar Tech and Amenities\n2023 Mercedes-Benz S580e 4Matic | Manufacturer image\n\nAn interior photo of the S580e reveals the same high-tech features of the current S-Class, including a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.8-inch touchscreen center display with the latest version of the MBUX multimedia system. Additionally, the sedan will borrow several comfort features from the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class’ interior, including customizable lighting with reading spotlights and a calf massage function for the rear seats.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe S580e will start at $123,700 (including a $1,150 destination charge). That splits the difference between the 2023 S-Classes, which currently start at $115,650 for the S500 and $125,150 for the S580. The S580e will go on sale in the first half of 2023, and shoppers can place an order now on the automaker’s website.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Mercedes-EQ EQS Review: Ze Germans Embrace ze Future\n2023 Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV Starts at $105,550, Adds New AWD Option\n2022 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: 6 Things We Like (and 5 Not So Much)\n2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: It’s What’s Inside That Counts\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz S-Class\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I used to chuckle at Mercedes-Benz drivers. To me, the sight of the cars either meant a rolling midlife crisis or something comparable to a weekend duffer bringing a $6,000 set of clubs to the public golf course. I mean, do you reallllllly need all that?\n\nNow, after having driven a string of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, I’ve become one of those motorists I used to laugh at. It must be some kind of Mercedes virus — either that, or prolonged exposure to the automaker’s luxury loaded cars prompts a bizarre addiction to the point where you find yourself saying things like, “What, no navigation system in this one? How gauche!”\n\nAt any rate, those who long for Mercedes’ storied engineering happily have many choices — from the merely pricey to the obscenely expensive. Here’s a look at the models I have sampled from the Mercedes lot:\n\n2001 C240 sedan\n\nIt’s a cute little five-passenger model from the C-Class. Oh, and it’s a steal in Mercedes terms with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $29,950.\n\nOh, sure, it has a comparatively humble 2.6-liter V-6 (168 horsepower), but it’s loaded with enough standard goodies to put your American-luxury-car-owning neighbors to shame. Leather seating inserts, wood interior trim, auto-dimming mirrors, stop-on-a-dime four-wheel disc brakes and front/rear crumple zones are just a few of the perks.\n\nThe V-6, by the way, more than handles what the local roadways dish out (sequential multipoint fuel injection helps, of course), and the C240 can be dressed up with various four-figure options to make it a more-worthy road warrior.\n\nEven with the base $29,950 version, you still get top-drawer M-B engineering, and the technicians at the elegant Mercedes-Benz service centers give you the same attention as those drivers bringing in six-figure-priced machines.\n\nPeople prowling for an entry-level Mercedes will have more to cheer about soon as the C-Class Coupe reaches American shores in numbers. That will be a bargain-basement offering among Mercedes vehicles, starting around $26,000.\n\n2001 S55 AMG sedan\n\nTo be precise, it’s a five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase (121.5 inches). But it’s a light year removed from the C240, with the “AMG” designation being the tip-off. AMG is M-B’s high-performance division, and in the S55, that translates to a 5.5-liter V-8 laying down 354 horsepower and 391 pounds/foot of torque (at only 3,000 revolutions per minute).\n\nThe standard package also includes an active suspension, ultra-fancy 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker premium Bose sound system with CD changer, 14-way power-adjustable front seats and a power telescoping steering wheel.\n\nAnd there’s the pleasure of watching a sports-car-driving wacko disappear in your rearview mirrors when you apply the power to your classy looking family sedan.\n\nPlease note, this kind of S-Class pleasure c osts $99,645 on the bottom line. That’s with zero options, a $645 destination/delivery charge and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\n2001 S600 sedan\n\nStill trying to digest that sticker price on the S55? What’s the big deal?\n\nHere’s another S-Class five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase, but with a 362 horsepower V-12 and a navigation system, the sticker price jumps to $115,945.\n\nPutting a right foot deep into an accelerator hooked up to a V-12 is an experience every motorist should experience at least once. It almost makes the drawbacks worth it. Those would be fear of parking within 10 feet of other vehicles, insurance bill terror and an overwhelming urge to rush outside every five minutes to see if anyone has put a ding in your car.\n\nOne other thing: The car has so much on it that it will take you at least three months to master every tech goodie explained in the owner’s manual.\n\n2002 SL500 coupe\n\nHere we g Much more reasonable. This SL-Class coupe/roadster carries two passengers and starts at only $83,800.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. This is a rich person’s toy. You’re 100 percent correct, and what a toy it is! Nothing stirs the automotive journalist’s soul like having momentary possession of a vehicle utterly beyond the reach of his income.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to pay the fare, the SL500 package includes a 302-horsepower V-8, independent damper struts on the front, rain-sensitive windshield wipers, headlight washer/wipers and a security system that does everything but write up an arrest report on the prospective offender.\n\nThrow in an extra $2,500 for a “Silver Arrow Edition” option, and you get amenities such as a bulletproof silver paint job, a six-CD changer and six-spoke wheels so dazzling that sunglasses are mandatory equipment for viewing.\n\n2001 CL600 coupe\n\nThis is the ultimate in the Mercedes-Benz test-model lot. The mother lode. The Holy Grail.\n\nThe four-passenger coupe with a 362 horsepower V-12, the full range of techno goodies and a 600-pages-plus owner’s manual that only those with advanced degrees in automotive engineering will fully understand starts at $117,200.\n\nMy test model was dressed up with perks that included a tire pressure-monitoring system, an electronic trunk closer, “Distronic” adaptive cruise control (which automatically adjusts for distance between vehicles while in cruise control) and AMG-added enhancements that brought the bottom line to $127,895.\n\nTo be honest, the entire time I had this test model I lived in fear of runaway shopping carts and no-look lane changers. Motorists with more money and bravery than I should know that this coupe represents just about the highest level of current automotive evolution.\n\n2001 CLK320 cabriolet\n\nAh, a nice way to finish our tour — a delightful four-passenger droptop with a comparatively easy-to-take MSRP of $48,900.\n\nGetting those two passengers into the back of the CLK320 might be a neat trick, but virtually everything else on this joy ride pleases. Handling for a low-range-priced Mercedes was outstanding. The softtop with a 215 horsepower V-6 held high-speed turns better than the new-for-2002 Lexus SC 430, which starts at $58,455.\n\nGolden State motorists who like to take that dream Big Sur coastal drive on Highway 1 south of Monterey take note: This might be the best car out there for that trip.",

      "expert_review": "The Mercedes S-class is the top of the line, the type of car that in an earlier time would have competed against such American makes as Packard, Duesenberg, or Pierce Arrow. Sadly, no American car slugs it out in this league any more, leaving it to a handful of foreign marques.\n\nWhat a pity. For this car is in many ways a modern iteration of what those fabled autos were: fast, secure, conservative, made of only the finest materials.\n\nThere are five ways to buy an S-class sedan. The “S” designation refers to the line of cars, in this case the Mercedes full-sized sedan line. The numeric designation refers to the engine.\n\nThe “entry-level” sedan is the S320, powered by a 228-horsepower in-line six. Base price: $64,000 for the standard wheelbase, $67,300 for the long wheelbase.\n\nNext up is the S420, which employs a 275-horsepower V8 and a suggested starting price of $73,900.\n\nIf you feel your V8 should have more zest, step up to S500 and its muscular 315-horsepower V8. It starts at $87,500.\n\nFinally, the line tops out with the extravagant S600, with a fire-breathing 389-horsepower V12 and a starting price of $132,250. (Zero-60 takes a hair more than six seconds. Yum!)\n\nNo matter what engine lies under the hood, its power feeds through a new five-speed automatic transmission that not only adapts to driving style, but also to changes in road grade. It also takes into account the pace at which you’re driving and adjusts the shift points accordingly. In any case, the transmission shifts smoothly, and always seems to be in the proper gear.\n\nThe test vehicle was an S420, and it lived up to the manufacturer’s claim of 0-60 an 8.1 seconds. Although power is only average at initial launch, it builds quickly, giving this sedan impressive muscle at speed.\n\nBraking is no-nonsense and quick. With 12.6-inch discs in front, 11.4-inch in back, it’s little wonder things come to halt quickly. Pedal feel is progressive, with good modulation.\n\nHandling is the perfect blend of tautness and suppleness that few automakers can match. With its bank-vault structure, the rutted paths that PennDOT calls roads have little effect on the car or its occupants.\n\nBody lean is minimal, and other intrusions, like wind or road noise, are non-existent. Thanks should go to such great details as double-pane windows, which insure a quiet ride.\n\nBut this is a luxury car, and not a faux luxury car, either. This is the type of auto one finds in such quantities in places like Palm Beach that you’d swear everyone owned one.\n\nWhat do you get for these house-sized prices?\n\nFirst, you gets a lot of safety features, such as front and side air bags, traction control and anti-lock brakes.\n\nNew for 1998 is the BabySmart system, which deactivates the front passenger-side air bag when a Mercedes Benz BabySmart child seat is used. When the seat isn’t occupied by a person weighing over 26 pounds, the air bag will not deploy.\n\nIf you’re not applying enough braking force in an emergency situation, Brake Assist recognizes it and applies more braking pressure. The traction control system not only uses braking power to regain traction, it also reduces engine power.\n\nSecond, there are a ton of little niceties that appeal to the most jaded of auto writers. The doors and trunk have pneumatic assists to pull them shut over the last half inch of travel. The steering wheel has tilt and telescoping features and is power activated. It’s tied into a memory profile system that remembers other settings, like seat position.\n\nOf course, leather and burled walnut trim line the interior. An 11-speaker Bose audio system transforms the car into a mobile concert hall. The trunk lid has a retracting handle that helps it to close, then disappears, thus preventing you from dirtying your hands.\n\nThird, it comes with extraordinary systems to prevent theft and ensure safety. The keyless ent ry uses infrared technology that incorporates an anti-cloning feature. It also has a summer mode, which opens all the windows and sunroof to clear the car of warm air before you enter.\n\nThe doors automatically lock at 9 mph, and the car will not start unless the correct key is used. There also is an infrared rain sensor that measures rain intensity and adjusts wiper speed accordingly. The headlamps are xenon-gas discharge; they have a cool cast and are less blinding than standard headlamps. Available is Mercedes Parktronic system, which uses sensors to detect when you’re too close to an object and sounds a warning.\n\nWith this type of opulence, it’s little wonder this Mercedes has garnered praise from many different sources, and not just bluebloods or yours truly. AAA named the S500 the best car over $50,000. Intellichoice named the S320 a “Best Value” in the luxury class. Robb Report named the S600 its “Best Luxury Car.”\n\nCertainly, few cars in the world compare. With its extreme handling capabilities, generous feature list and opulent ways, few autos give quite the thrill that driving this one does.\n\nWhat’s sadder is that America once fielded competitors of this caliber, but no longer does.\n\nNationalism aside, it’s a treat that a car like this still exists. Try one before it’s legislated out of existence.\n\n1998 Mercedes S420\n\nStandard: 4.2-liter double overhead-cam 32-valve V8, five-speed electronic automatic transmission, speed-dependent power steering, automatic slip control, 235/60R16 tires with six-hole alloy wheels, automatic climate control with charcoal filter, leather upholstery, burled walnut trim, front and rear folding armrests with cup holders, remote locking, cruise control, Bose sound system, CD-cellular phone pre-wiring, AM/FM/weather band cassette radio, power glass sunroof, headlamp washers, front and rear reading lamps and vanity mirrors, electropneumatic door and trunk closing assist, auto dimming rearview and driver’s side mirrors, electric tilt/telescopic steering wheel, retractable rear headrests, power windows with express up and down, intermittent wipers with rain sensors, integrated garage door opener, dual front and side air bags, anti-theft system, halogen foglamps, power four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and brake assist.\n\nOptions: Electronic Stability Program, xenon-charged headlamps, heated front seats.\n\nBase price: $73,900\n\nAs tested: $78,340\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city, 22 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 17 mpg",

      "expert_review": "There probably is something the Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan can’t do.\n\nWhat that may be escapes us at the moment.\n\nThe S-Class defines personal luxury — and in doing so keeps you busy pushing buttons, twisting levers, yanking handles and barking out commands to some gnome hiding behind the dash who makes all the gizmos come to life.\n\nFor 2007 the S-Class features a redesign, which thankfully doesn’t adhere as rigidly as its sister cars in recent years to the philosophy that though sedans outsell coupes by roughly a million to one, all sedans must have a coupe’s low-slung, sloping roof line.\n\nIt also adopts what all automakers have done when bringing out the next generation of any model — larger dimensions. The S-Class grows 1 1/2 inches in length, 1 inch in height and one-half inch in width while the wheelbase adds 3 inches. The S-Class was big and roomy to begin with and no one was complaining they needed more. Consider the expansion size a bonus.\n\nWe tested the ’07 S-Class with the newly offered 4Matic all-wheel-drive system, which ensures the machine clings to the pavement when wet or dry.\n\nA couple major changes include a new gearshift stalk above and to the right of the steering wheel with only reverse, drive and park settings. Traditionalists will feel shortchanged.\n\nAlso new is the very energetic 5.5-liter, 382-horsepower, 32-valve V-8 with 7-speed automatic. It has push-button start and the need to carry a bulky key fob filled with the electronics to activate the system. For the ability to quickly and quietly propel more than two tons from the light, the penalty is a $1,300 federal gas guzzler tax in a vehicle rated at 15 m.p.g. city and 22 m.p.g. highway.\n\nMercedes boasts that the engine can accelerate from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 5.4 seconds, a second less than its predecessor, while not sacrificing fuel economy.\n\nMuscle aside, the S-Class’ strong suit is room and comfort as well as amenities. Lounge seats front and rear heat in the winter and cool in the summer — part of $2,850 and $2,900 option packages. They’re also ventilated to keep your clothes as fresh as when pulled from the closet. A lower dry cleaning bill will offset the $5,750 option cost, don’t you think?\n\nThe S is a pleasure to pilot. You can adjust the suspension to comfort or sport settings for soft ride or pinpoint handling. In the comfort mode, the ride is so plush you welcome long-distance travel. In the sport mode, the two-ton-plus machine handles in corners and turns as if a much lighter-weight sports sedan. Credit 4Matic as well as traction control and electronic stability control for ballerina-like maneuvers from a middle linebacker.\n\nThe rear seat is limo like. Stretch legs as far as they go and chances are they still don’t touch the seat ahead. Even if the driver motors the power seat as far back as it goes, Mercedes took steps to ensure ample knee room in back by incorporating large indents on both front seat backs.\n\nThanks to those option packages, the rear seats are also power-operated to move forward and backward or recline. Huge vents under the front seats and along the back of the center console ensure ample circulation of hot or cold air. An armrest folds down from the seat back and a trio of cupholders slips out. There’s also a power rear-window shade with controls in the armrests and dash.\n\nThe test car also came with a panoramic sunroof with a power open/close glass upfront and a skylight in back. A single sunroof is standard. There’s also pull-down coat hooks above the doors and vanity mirrors that pop out of the roof to serve rear-seat occupants.\n\nUpfront, driver and passenger seats have storage compartments underneath, with a first-aid kit on the passenger side. Many cars have first-aid kits in the trunk, where they are difficult to reach quickly in an emergency without stopping. Under the passenger seat is a much wiser location.\n\nAlso of note, the trunk is very spacious and houses two stowage compartments under the floor. And the trunk lid, and all doors, automatically shut tight if you fail to close them with sufficient force. And forget the needles; all gauges are space-age graphics.\n\nOf course, the S-Class has a few aggravations, one being the Comand control dial in the center console that activates features from navigation system to radio stations. Not as mentally challenging as iDrive in a BMW, but it takes some time to master. Of course, you can use voice activation or resort to the old-fashioned method — pressing a button.\n\nThe navigation system uses a global positioning satellite to “make driving less stressful,” Mercedes says, by “removing the anxiety of getting lost or worse , having to stop and ask for directions.” So getting lost is OK, but having to ask someone for help is worse? Remember, however, that Mercedes is part of the company that thinks it’s smart to sell Chrysler and go it alone.\n\nThere are a lot of other neat features in the S-Class, such as Distronic, or adaptive cruise control, which uses braking or engine control to keep you from running into a vehicle ahead. Without Distronic, if you have to brake suddenly, the braking system automatically engages full power to lessen the impact.\n\nOther neat features include stowage in all doors, power rear-seat headrests, massaging front seats, a suspension that rises when traveling over rough spots to smooth the ride, and sensors that raise the side windows to provide support for the side-curtain air bags when vehicle spin or roll is detected.\n\nUnder study are knee cushions that deploy from under the dash in an impact and retract afterward to be used again, and a seat system in which the height, weight and gender of each occupant is fed into a computer to adjust the position of each seat, the tension of each safety belt and the inflation rate of each air bag. Stay tuned.\n\nBase price is $88,750.\n\nStandard equipment includes anti-lock brakes; 18-inch, all-season radials; AM/FM radio with CD player; leather upholstery; GPS navigation system; power and heated front seats; power windows and locks; power rear-window sun shade; dual-zone climate control; hands-free phone and TeleAid emergency communication system.\n\n– – –\n\n2007 Mercedes-Benz S550Matic\n\nPrice as tested: $102,000 *\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$88,750 Base\n\n$2,900 Rear-seat package with eight-way power, heated and ventilated seats and four-zone climate control\n\n$2,850 Distronic plus adaptive cruise control\n\n$2,850 Premium package with Parktronic, ventilated front seats, keyless start and Sirius satellite radio with six months free service\n\n$1,800 Multicontour front seats with massage\n\n$1,300 Savanna/Cashmere leather\n\n$1,000 Panorama sunroof\n\n$550 Wood/leather steering wheel\n\n* Add $1,300 gas-guzzler tax and $775 for freight.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nWheelbase: 124.6 inches\n\nLength: 205 inches\n\nEngine: 5.5-liter, 382-h.p.

A modified air-conditioning system is available this year, and a radar-based Distronic Adaptive Cruise Control is a new option. It intelligently adjusts the cars speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle directly ahead. A Keyless Go option also is available, and the S-Class now has an internal emergency trunk release.\n\nFour versions of Mercedes largest, most costly sedan are available. The S430 has a 4.3-liter V-8 engine, the S500 holds a 5.0-liter V-8 and the S600 uses a 5.8-liter V-12. To save fuel part of the time, the driver can deactivate half of the V-12s cylinders. Performance-oriented buyers can also choose the S55 AMG, which is equipped with a 355-horsepower, 5.5-liter V-8, as well as a sport suspension, bigger tires and aerodynamic body trim.\n\nBilled by Mercedes as the executive athlete, the S55 AMG will set you back nearly $100,000. Both the ultimate-luxury S600  which costs $15,000 more  and the S55 AMG have standard Active Body Control that continuously adjusts suspension firmness to eliminate body roll during cornering, acceleration and braking.\n\nThe S-Class was redesigned in a smaller and lighter configuration for the 2000 model year, and S600 and S55 AMG versions were added later. Mercedes-Benz calls the S-Class the definitive automotive experience. Sticker prices might cause some interested parties to gasp, but a lot of S-Class sedans are leased rather than purchased.\n\nExterior\nMercedes describes the S-Class as a sedan with a coupelike profile, highlighted by a low nose and taller tail. A laid-back grille and smooth underbody improve airflow, keeping the sedans coefficient of drag (a measure of a vehicles resistance to the air through which it passes) at a low 0.27.\n\nMeasuring 203.1 inches long overall, the S-Class sedan is about as long as the BMW 745iL and more than 6 inches longer than the Lexus LS 430. Riding a 121.5-inch wheelbase, the sedan is 73.1 inches wide and stands 56.9 inches high.\n\nAn Airmatic air suspension is standard on the S430 and S500. With its sport suspension, racy aerodynamic body trim and 18-inch tires on Monoblock alloy wheels, the S55 AMG is equipped for high-speed travel.\n\nInterior\nWith a standard three-place rear bench, seating for five occupants is provided. A split, rear bench with power adjustments is optional. The front seats have 14-way power adjustments, as well as head restraints that can serve as pillows. Full leather upholstery, a navigation system and a Bose audio system are standard in the S430 and S500.\n\nBefitting its price, the S600 gets a higher level of wood and leather trim, as well as four heated power seats, four-zone climate control, a CD changer and a voice-controlled digital phone. Features in the S55 AMG include active ventilated/multicontour front seats and a trunk-mounted CD changer. A Sport Package for regular models includes an AMG-designed spoiler, a rear apron, side skirts and 18-inch tires on Monoblock alloy wheels.\n\nStandard equipment includes Tele Aid, which uses its own cellular-phone system to summon emergency help, call Mercedes roadside assistance operators or track a stolen vehicle. If an airbag deploys, help is sought automatically. An optional InfoServices feature taps into the Internet to deliver news headlines, stock quotes, sports scores, weather reports and other services.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMercedes-Benz offers quite a selection of engines: three V-8s and a V-12, with model designations matching the engine size. Among the V-8 sedans, the S430 has a 275-hp, 4.3-liter V-8, while the S500 gets a 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 and the high-performance S55 AMG uses a hand-assembled 5.5-liter V-8 that pumps out 355 hp. The S600 sedan carries a 362-hp, 5.8-liter V-12. All models have a five-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a manual-shift mode for use whenever desired. Mercedes claims that the S55 AMG accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds.\n\nSafety\nEight airbags are standard, starting with the federally required front units. Side-impact airbags are installed in each of the four doors. Inflatable curtain-type airbags in the front and rear deploy from the roofline to protect occupants heads. The front passengers airbag deploys with lower force in low-speed collisions and with maximum force when the impact is greater.\n\nMercedes Electronic Stability Program combines traction control with lateral-skid control technology. Brake Assist applies maximum braking force when it senses an imminent abrupt stop. Antilock brakes are standard, and a Parktronic system is included in the S600.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe S-Class is loaded with so much technology that it can seem overwhelming, but it provides a memorable highway experience regardless of what engine is beneath the hood. The S-Class is a smooth and supremely capable cruiser that may initially be marred by what some drivers could consider a slight sense of detachment. That sensation soon eases, but despite its bounty of alluring attributes, steering seems just a little too light and easy.\n\nThe S500s performance, on the other hand, approaches the level of stunning, and automatic-transmission response qualifies as masterful. Even though the ride is smooth, the S500 does hit a few bumps rather hard. In fast curves, the big sedan stays remarkably upright.\n\nThe automakers Electronic Stability Program performs competently; it is ready to do its job with little evidence of its presence. In this prestigious motorcar, every element operates with subtlety and finesse, so you barely notice any changes that might be taking place within and beneath the vehicle.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A8, BMW 7-Series, Genesis G90\n\nLooks like: A slightly larger take on the outgoing S-Class, with subtle exterior refinements (honestly, we can hardly tell the difference, and we’re professionals)\n\nPowertrain: 429-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (S500) or 496-hp, 4.0-liter V-8 (S580), both turbocharged with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems that can add an extra 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque for temporary acceleration assistance; nine-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive standard at launch\n\nHits dealerships: First half of 2021\n\nMercedes-Benz wouldn’t be Mercedes-Benz without the S-Class sedan, so even in an SUV-obsessed world, the German luxury brand is giving its flagship full-size sedan an overhaul for the 2021 model year. Already loaded with technology and safety features, the new S-Class becomes the most advanced Benz you can buy, at least until the features start trickling down to the rest of Mercedes’ lineup — just don’t expect it to look drastically different, or really much different at all, when it arrives in dealerships at some point in the first half of 2021.\n\nRelated: Next-Gen Mercedes-Benz S-Class Will Give You a Lift (in the Event of a Crash)\n\nExterior\n\nThe most significant change to the new S-Class’ exterior is a reduction in character lines on its sides, along with slightly smaller, flatter headlights. In back, the taillights trade the outgoing S-Class’ taller shapes for thinner, slitlike profiles — more akin to what you see on the redesigned CLA- and CLS-Class sedans.\n\nThe redesign is also a bit larger than its predecessor, at just over an inch longer and almost half an inch taller. Despite the increase in major dimensions, particularly to the frontal area of the car, the new S-Class has a lower coefficient of drag than the outgoing generation. The added dimensions also give the sedan a 2-inch longer wheelbase and wider front and rear tracks.\n\nInterior\n\nInterior space wasn’t really a concern in the previous S-Class, but the redesign offers increases in most measurements, including rear head- and legroom, as well as front and rear elbow room. Rear shoulder room has decreased by more than an inch, but trunk capacity is also slightly larger, by Mercedes’ measurements.\n\nMBUX, or the Mercedes-Benz User Experience, debuts its newest iteration here. We’ve covered it in detail already: It now includes a 12.8-inch touchscreen and up to four other screens, with voice-command support for 27 different languages and significantly reduced physical controls for a cleaner aesthetic. (While we tend to lament the lack of physical audio and climate controls, as do consumers, Mercedes will pin the climate controls to the bottom of the display. It’s not our ideal, but at least they aren’t buried in a submenu.)\n\nOther fun interior details include 10 different massage patterns for the seats and 64-color LED ambient lighting that uses some 250 LEDs. (The old S-Class only had 40 because it was for peasants.) The standard stereo includes Burmester 3-D surround-sound, while an optional Burmester 4-D stereo augments that with seat-embedded resonators.\n\nEngines and Transmission \n\nAt launch, buyers will have a choice of the S500 or S580, both with Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel drive. The S500 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine producing 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque. The S580 gets a turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 good for 496 hp and 516 pounds-feet. If that isn’t enough, both engines also come with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that can activate an EQ Boost feature that adds 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque for “short periods” — like, say, dusting the guy who just asked if you have any Grey Poupon. Both engines pair with a nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAn air suspension is standard, but new for this year is Mercedes’ E-Active Body Control, which can read and adjust to road conditions and driving to reduce body motion. It also plays a role in occupant safety (more on that in the next section). Four-wheel steering is also optional, and it can reduce the turning radius by 6 feet, according to Mercedes.\n\nMercedes did not provide 0-60-mph acceleration, though it did say each S-Class is electronically limited to a top speed of 130 mph.\n\nSafety Features and Driver Assist Systems\n\nThe tech bonanza continues with a number of advanced safety features. Besides the usual driver assist features, the new S-Class is now available with a bevy of features.\n\nAn augmented-reality head-up display is equivalent to a 77-inch diagonal display viewed from 32 feet away, Mercedes says. It can display animated turn-by-turn instructions directly onto the lane ahead.\nA three-dimensional driver display can display the vehicle’s surroundings without the use of special eyewear thanks to driver eye-tracking.\nActive ambient lighting can produce visual warnings as part of the operation of various safety systems — for example, turning red to warn of an impending collision when the Active Blind Spot Assist system warns of one.\nWith the optional E-Active Body Control system, the S-Class can lift itself up to 3 inches prior to a side collision to better redirect crash forces from occupants toward reinforced body structures.\nThe Executive Rear Seat Package now includes frontal airbags for the rear passengers to better protect them in the event of a crash.\nCapacitive hands-off recognition detects when your hands are on or off the wheel, rather than the usual force-sensitive logic in most cars. Still, lane-centering steering requires you to hold the wheel, Mercedes-Benz told us. Hands-free lane centering — offered currently or soon by BMW, Cadillac, Ford and Infiniti — is not available.\n\n \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "IMAGINE DYING and going to heaven only to be denied entry because you led a life of excess.\n\nImagine that happening without ever having had a chance to drive the biggest and most expensive of all Mercedes-Benz sedans, the S600.\n\nYou’d have a right to be angry — to hire a lawyer and file suit against the Pearly Gates Board of Admissions.\n\nFor surely somewhere it is written that no one can be judged guilty of wanton indulgence unless he or she has had regular access to the wickedly plush S600.\n\nThis is the car with everything for the person who has everything. It has leather, walnut wood, deep-pile carpeting, vanity mirrors front and rear, reading lamps, separate rear air conditioning, a computerized smog sensor designed to keep vehicular exhaust out of the passenger cabin, a top-line Bose sound system replete with cassette and trunk-mounted compact disc changer, power seats and windows, power door and trunk locks, power sunroof, a power steering wheel that moves up and down or telescopes in and out at the push of a button. It has automatic climate control, a hands-off cellular phone, a sophisticated anti-theft system, electronic stability and anti-slip controls, anti-lock brakes, an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, front and side air bags and bank-vault doors.\n\nHave mercy! The S600 has a V-12 engine, too! If you can’t go to hell in this car, you ain’t going; and if you go there without ever having driven this car, you’ve gone to the wrong place. You’d better find a way to contact Johnnie Cochran.\n\nBackground: The only thing I can figure is that Mercedes-Benz wanted to produce a car to demonstrate all of the company’s available automotive amenities and technologies.\n\nFor example, take the S600’s remote-entry system, ensconced in a key-fob transmitter and a single sensor located in the rear-view mirror. Pushing the transmitter button once will unlock or lock the doors. Pushing it twice in rapid succession will open the trunk. If the car is unlocked with its windows down and sunroof open, holding down the transmitter button will raise the windows, shut the sunroof, lock the doors and lock the trunk. Excess? You bet-cha!\n\nAh, and then there’s the matter of the Mercedes-Benz Electronic Stability Program (ESP), which works in conjunction with the company’s Automatic Slip Reduction (ASR) and anti-lock braking system(ABS).\n\nThe computer-driven ESP monitors and corrects any tendency toward understeer (when a car’s front wheels respond too slowly to steering) or oversteer (when a car’s rear wheels swing around, causing the car to fishtail). Either understeer or oversteer can lead to loss of driver control — and a crash.\n\nWhen it senses understeer, ESP automatically applies brake pressure on the turn’s inside rear wheel. During oversteer, the car automatically applies brake pressure to the turn’s outside front wheel. Either brake application helps to keep the car going in its intended, safe d irection.\n\nASR limits wheel spin on wet and icy roads. ABS prevents wheel-lock in panic stops, thus helping the driver to steer around an obstacle.\n\nThe S600’s double-overhead cam, 48-valve, variable intake, V-12 engine is rated (gulp!) 389 horsepower at 5,200 rpm with torque rated 420 pound-feet at 3,800 rpm. The dang car is 17 feet long and weighs 2.5 tons. But the engine is so powerful, it moves the S600 from 0 to 60 mph in six seconds!\n\nThe S600 sits at the top of Mercedes-Benz’s S-class sedans, which also include the S320, S420 and S500. The S320 comes with a standard, 228-horsepower inline six-cylinder engine. The S420 comes with a standard 275-horsepower V8, and the S500 is equipped with a 315-horsepower V8.\n\nAll S-class sedans (four doors) are front-engine, rear-wheel-drive cars capable of seating four passengers luxuriously in four power seats and a fifth in steerage between the two rear seats. All have trunks capable of carrying 15.6 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nEvenm re expensive S500 and S600 two-door, hardtop coupes are available.\n\nComplaints: Total nitpicks. Mercedes-Benz still doesn’t know diddly about cup holders, placing them next to the cellular phone; and it needs to come up with stronger enclosures for its sound-system speakers mounted on the lower front doors. It’s too easy to accidentally kick and crack the current enclosures.\n\nPraise: Driving the S600 is heaven on earth, which means you have no reason to expect much in the afterlife.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Gets looks. Creates envy. Gets respect. Creates fear. People who think you got the car legitimately scrape and bow. Those who think it’s financed by pelf give you quick, dirty looks, but otherwise stay the hell out of your way.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces. Ace for braking, too.\n\nMileage: Ha! You think someone who buys this car is worried about gasoline prices? It gets 16 miles per gallon, maybe. It drinks only the best of premium unleaded. Fuel capacity is 26.4 gallons, which means the range works out to about 406 miles on the usable volume of gasoline. Test trips were with one to two occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Eleven-speaker Bose Beta system with AM/FM stereo radio and cassette and trunk-mounted CD changer. Simply blows your mind.\n\nPrice: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. The suggested retail price is $130,300. Dealer invoice price on the S600 sedan is $113,360. Price as tested is $142,630, including $2,600 in gas-guzzler taxes and another, estimated $9,730 federal “luxury tax.”\n\nPurse-strings note: Oh, Lord, won’t-cha buy me a Mercedes-Benz? Chances are I ain’t goin’ to heaven. This will make amends.",

      "expert_review": "Even as BMW, Audi and Jaguar throw new cars into the luxury-flagship ring, Mercedes-Benz has kept its S-Class sedan competitive, with sedans that start below $90,000 and top out at more than double that.\n\nThe S-Class is still a spectacle of refinement — though it’s dinged in small part by an inconsistent accelerator pedal.\n\nWhile the S-Class is four years into the current generation, new for 2010 is the V-6-powered S400 Hybrid, which we cover in greater detail here. It anchors the bottom of the S-Class lineup. In order of ascending price, the rest of the lineup includes the S550, S63 AMG, S600 and S65 AMG. Click here to compare the group. All five models employ rear-wheel drive, but the S550 also offers all-wheel drive. I evaluated an all-wheel-drive S550.\n\nStately Design\n\nRedesigned for 2007, the S-Class has always been a handsome, if conservative, car. For 2010, a few visual updates give it a more assertive presence, which is a welcome change. The bumpers get a more aggressive front air dam that’s flanked by horizontal LED daytime running lights on all but the base S400. The grille is more angular, and it keeps Mercedes’ trademark three-pointed hood ornament. The rear bumper has wider tailpipes integrated into it, and the rear loses the earlier color-striped taillights for a more uniform red. This is how it should have been all along; side-by-side with the ’10, the ’09 taillights look a bit dorky.\n\nTop-tier luxury sedans from BMW, Jaguar, Lexus and Audi offer regular and extended wheelbases. For American buyers, the S-Class comes in just one wheelbase, and it’s long. Sedans like these are as long as most minivans, and with an overall length of 206.5 inches, the S-Class is among the group’s largest. Its 40-foot turning circle falls on the tighter side of the class, believe it or not, but that’s still well into SUV territory. City drivers, you’ve been warned.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard. A Sport package on the S400 and S550 adds larger wheels, as well as the requisite deeper bumpers and side skirts. The S600 has unique bumpers and 18-, 19- or 20-inch wheels. The S63 and S65 AMG have even more aggressive bodywork, along with 20-inch wheels and quad tailpipes.\n\nRide, Handling\n\nWith an air suspension that can be adjusted to varying levels, the S550 rides with soothing composure. The BMW 7 Series is firmer, and the Jaguar XJ is downright stiff in comparison. It’s even more impressive given our test car’s 19-inch wheels, which come with the Sport package (suspension tuning is the same). Driving just gets easier: You don’t have to think about avoiding manhole covers or street-side ruts. The S550 packs them off to some distant universe where alarm clocks, mass emails and other annoyances go to die.\n\nOver stretches of uneven pavement, the car maintained remarkable control. There’s minimal wheel hop, good steering response and very little suspension float. That’s often a downside for soft-riding cars, and it’s nice to see Mercedes sidestepped the tendency. Activate the suspension’s Sport mode — distinct from the transmission’s Sport mode, activated via another button — and a few more bumps seep up to the cabin, but it’s not rough by any means. On the downside, body roll on curvy roads is noticeable in either suspension mode. An active suspension feature, which forcibly counteracts body roll as it occurs, is available in Mercedes’ optional Active Body Control. We’ve evaluated a few other Mercedes products that have it, and it keeps things impressively flat on curves. ABC is optional on the rear-drive S550 and standard on the S600, S63 and S65. It’s unavailable on the S400 and all-wheel-drive S550.\n\nThe S400 and S550 without ABC have silky-smooth steering. The wheel turns with light effort at low speeds, though there’s a tad too much power assist at highway speeds for my taste. On sweeping curves, the car handles well. With little of the nose-heavy push that some Mercedes cars exhibit, the S550 displays enough balance to slide the rear and rotate the car with the accelerator. The XJ has better precision, but the S-Class is no turkey.\n\nPower, Eventually\n\nWeighing more than 4,600 pounds, our all-wheel-drive test car was heavier than many large crossovers. But its engine — a 5.5-liter V-8 good for 382 horsepower and an impressive 391 pounds-feet of torque — made the car feel downright light. Even loaded with adult passengers, the S550 moves out from a standstill and pulls strong on the interstate. Enjoy it responsibly; the power never seems to run out, and without an eye on the speedometer you’ll soon reach triple digits.\n\nThe rub, unfortunately, is accelerator lag. Such lag has long been a result of the electronic throttles that are employed across the industry, and it ranges from minor to pronounced. The worst cases display erratic inconsistencies, and the S550 is among them. Press the gas, and the resulting thrust could be relatively immediate, or it might be delayed by a half-second or more. It’s vexing, and we’ve noted it in cars as diverse as the Audi A6 and the now-discontinued Saturn Outlook. Mercedes, for its part, seems to be a repeat offender; we’ve also noticed accelerator lag in the GL-Class and the prior-gen E-Class.\n\nThe S550’s seven-speed automatic shifts smoothly, upshifting lickety-split when you press hard on the gas. (The S400, S550 and S63 have a seven-speed auto, but the S600 and S65 employ a five-speed.) It’s not the best about kicking down to lower gears — the Jaguar XJ’s six-speed automatic is better — but the V-8’s prodigious torque means you can power out of a corner even in a higher one. The transmission offers a Sport mode, which holds lower gears longer and lessens the probability that you’ll need a downshift. Should you need to, Sport mode still takes its time, unfortunately.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. Our S550’s brakes bit down high in the pedal’s travel, which several editors noted gave the process a nonlinear, or abrupt, sensation. Other S-Class variants may improve on this: The S600 has larger discs, while the S63 and S65 get cross-drilled, 15.4-inch front and 14.4-inch rear discs. (That’s into the upper echelons of supercar territory — just 0.3 inches smaller than the 987-hp Bugatti Veyron’s front discs.)\n\nMove up the chain, and you can get as much as 604 hp in the S65 AMG. Both AMG cars have an AMG Speedshift automatic, with significantly decreased shift times over the regular transmission. In the other direction, the S400 Hybrid teams a 3.5-liter V-6 with an integrated motor. It’s a mild hybrid, not a full one, so the motor chips in to help the V-6 but can’t power the car on its own. It runs off a compact lithium-ion battery — among the first lithium-ion applications in a mass-market hybrid. Combined gas mileage is 21 mpg, a 17 percent improvement over the S550. (Most of that comes by virtue of having two fewer cylinders: In Europe, the V-6 S350, whose engine the S400 uses, is already 11 percent more fuel efficient than the S500, equivalent to our S550.)\n\nWe drove the S400 last winter, and while it doesn’t provide the S550’s effortless thrust, it certainly has enough passing power. The brakes, on the other hand, are disappointing: They employ a regenerative function, like most hybrid-vehicle brakes, but the effect makes for a stiff pedal that’s more bricklike. Even for a hybrid — but especially for a Mercedes-Benz — the S400’s brakes need work.\n\nHere’s how the S-Class variants stack up:\n\nDrivetrains Compared\n \tS400 Hybrid\tS550\tS63 AMG\tS600\tS65 AMG\nBase price*\t$86,800\t$91,600 (RWD), $95,600 (AWD)\t$136,550\t$152,700\t$204,150\nDrivetrain\t3.5L V-6 with electric motor\t5.5L V-8\t6.2L V-8\t5.5L twin-turbo V-12\t6.0L twin-turbo V-12\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t295 @ 6,000**\t382 @ 6,000\t518 @ 6,800\t510 @ 5,000\t604 @ 4,800\nTorque (lbs.-ft., @ rpm)\t284 @ 2,400 – 5,000**\t391 @ 2,800 – 4,800\t465 @ 5,200\t612 @ 1,800 – 3,500\t738 @ 2,000 – 4,000\nDriveline\tRWD\tRWD or AWD\tRWD\tRWD\tRWD\nTransmission\t7-speed auto\t7-speed auto\t7-speed auto\t 5-speed auto\t5-speed auto\nZero to 60 mph, sec.\t7.2\t5.4 (RWD)\t4.5\t4.5\t4.2\n\n\nEPA fuel economy\n(city/hwy., mpg)\n\n\t19/25\t15/23 (RWD), 14/21 (AWD)\t11/18\t11/17\t11/17\n*Prices reflect applicable $1,150 federal hybrid-vehicle tax credit for S400 and federal gas-guzzler taxes of $1,000 for the S550 AWD and $3,000 for the S63, S600 and S65.\n**Combined electric/gas power.\nSource: EPA and automaker data\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCabin Comfort\nIt’s hard to believe the cabin design in the S-Class is four years old. It feels contemporary, from its broad instrument shelf, which spans two-thirds of the dashboard, to the seamless row of climate switches. The front seats are thrones of comfort — wide and flat, with enough thigh support for someone well over 6 feet tall.\n\nThe backseat is large; by the numbers, it offers more legroom than the front seats, though it doesn’t quite match backseat legroom in the extended-wheelbase  7 Series and XJ. Power-adjustable rear seats are optional, as is four-zone climate control, which gives the outboard rear passengers their own zones. Our test car had both options. While logging impressions, I could have fallen asleep back there.\n\nMercedes’ Comand interface employs a control knob for the standard navigation system. Compared with the knob-based systems from BMW and Audi, Comand is the most intuitive. The dashboard screen packs excellent graphics, and the navigation map has ample street labels. Its traffic indicators for major streets — lines of car icons in yellow or red — are easier to pick out than other systems’ tiny, colored stripes. Zoom out a bit, however, and the car icons can obscure nearby streets. And Comand’s voice recognition system could use some work: It didn’t pick up my home street despite multiple attempts and varying pronunciation. The streets it matched weren’t even close.\n\nA standard 15-speaker Harman Kardon stereo with surround sound includes a six-CD changer, high-def and satellite radio, and full iPod compatibility. From Vivaldi to Zeppelin, it sounded superb — in the league of the Audi A8’s excellent Bang & Olufsen stereo.\n\nTrunk volume is a competitive 16.4 cubic feet. Like many top-end luxury sedans, the S-Class does not offer a folding backseat. There isn’t even a pass-through for skis, a feature a number of competitors offer.\n\nSafety & Features\n\nThe S-Class has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety features include eight airbags, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes. Click here to see a full list.\n\nStandard on the S550 and up is Mercedes’ Attention Assist system, which monitors a number of factors to intuit driver drowsiness. It alerts you with warning chimes and instrument indicators. Other options include a night vision system with pedestrian detection and fully adaptive cruise control that can initiate automatic braking if a collision is imminent.\n\nAn optional lane departure warning system uses cameras to detect lane markings; at higher speeds it vibrates the steering wheel should you cross over without signaling. Our test car had it, and one editor found the system less effective for catching your attention than the audible chimes that go off in many competing systems.\n\nCompare the 2009 and 2010 S-Class here. Mercedes products never come cheap, and the S-Class is a primary example. The 2010 S400 starts at $87,950, minus a $1,150 hybrid federal tax credit. That’s around the same price as the long-wheelbase 7 Series but $9,300 more than the long-wheelbase Jaguar XJ — and more than $17,000 more than a long-wheelbase Lexus LS. (As of this writing, Audi’s redesigned 2011 A8 hasn’t been priced yet, but the 2010 A8 starts under $80,000.) Standard features on the S400 include an air suspension, the Harman Kardon stereo, heated 14-way power-adjustable front seats, xenon headlights, leather upholstery, a navigation system and a moonroof.\n\nThe S550 starts at $91,600. All-wheel drive effectively adds $4,000 — the system itself costs $3,000, but it dings gas mileage enough to incur a $1,000 federal gas-guzzler tax. Beyond that, pricing truly gets steep. The S63 AMG runs $133,550, the S600 $149,700 and the S65 a hefty $201,150. All three get a miserable 13 to 14 mpg combined — which bumps the guzzler tax up to $3,000. Options on lesser S-Class sedans include adaptive (swiveling) headlights, a backup camera, heated and ventilated seats for both rows, massaging front seats, power rear seats, a rear entertainment system with dual monitors, and a panoramic moonroof. Naturally, just about all of those features are standard on the S600 and S65.\n\nS-Class in the Market\n\nIt’s fascinating that Mercedes can charge such a premium and still have the second-best-selling car in its class. What’s more, all this has happened even as the current generation hits its fourth year. The popularity is deserved: The S-Class is aging well, and it’s no longer the reliability sinkhole it used to be.\n\nCompetitors are trying to reinvent the wheel, but I don’t think a luxury flagship needs to be a sport sedan, too. Mercedes knew its mission, and it hit the nail on the head.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Redesigned for the 2000 model year, Mercedes-Benz has continuously refined its S-Class flagship sedan, bolstering its competence with bells and whistles to an almost-scary level of sophistication. Hop behind the wheel in T-shirt and jeans, and you’ll feel lucky the car agrees to start.\n\nThe test model, a 2003 S430, is the cheapest in the S-Class lineup – of course, “cheap” is relative, when the starting price is $72,600. The “430” refers to the engine size, a 4.3-liter, 275-horsepower V-8 that is, like all Mercedes V-8s, smooth and strong.\n\nIt’s mated to a five-speed automatic transmission that is nicely calibrated for the engine’s power and offers “Touch Shift” if you’d prefer to shift for yourself. Flick the lever left to downshift, right to upshift.\n\nInside, it’s all leather and wood, with more than enough room for five genuine adults. At 203.1 inches long and 73 inches wide, the S430 is smaller than a Dodge Intrepid, but the car feels much roomier than you’d expect. Handling is reasonably nimble for the 4,160-pound vehicle, but it isn’t as sporty as, say, a BMW 7-Series. Fuel mileage – at 17 miles per gallon city, 24 mpg highway – isn’t bad.\n\nEven with no options, the test car was loaded. Features included the “Airmatic” air-controlled suspension, front and side air bags with side curtains, a navigation system, a 10-speaker Bose sound system, rain-sensing wipers, the TeleAid satellite-linked emergency communications system, electronic stability control, even a power rear-window sunshade. I am not crazy about the COMAND system, a TV screen in the dash that controls multiple functions, and a few other unintuitive controls will send you to the owner’s manual for explanation. Perhaps your butler can explain it to you; mine was unavailable, so I was forced to figure it out for myself.\n\nAs mentioned, there are more expensive S-Class sedans – the V-12-powered S600 lists for more than $115,000 – but even the S430 is humbling. The new-for-2003 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, completely redesigned to favor the S-Class probably more than S-Class owners would like, will likely steal some sales from the S-Class until Mercedes redesigns it. The 2003 E500 has a 5.0-liter, 302-horsepower V-8, and while it may not have the S-Class’ cachet or quite as many features, it lists for less than $55,000.\n\nIf you can afford the S-Class, though, I am certainly not trying to talk you out of it. Capitalism is a wonderful thing.",

      "expert_review": "When a car costs as much as a house, as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class does, it makes you take a step back. Can a car this expensive really be worth it? After spending a week with an S550, I can tell you that if any ultraluxury car can justify its gold-plated price tag, it’s this one. Mercedes’ flagship offers a level of power, luxury, technology and prestige found in only a select few full-size luxury sedans.\n\nElegant and Modern\nThe S-Class commands respect. The sedan’s strong visual presence is highlighted by a sleek front end that incorporates triangular headlights and a classic Mercedes grille. The edges of the headlights flow into bulging front fenders that are mimicked over the rear wheels as well (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model).\n\nContributing to the car’s serious look is the optional AMG Sport Package that gives the S-Class some of the look, if not the performance, of a high-performance AMG version of the S-Class. The package includes 19-inch AMG-style alloy wheels, more-aggressive bumpers and rocker panels, and chrome exhaust tips. It costs $5,630.\n\nThe Strong, Silent Type\nThe S-Class is available with a range of V-8 and V-12 engines that produce from 382 horsepower in the V-8 S550 up to 604 hp in the ultimate-bragging-rights sedan: the S65 AMG with a twin-turbo V-12. In between are the S600 with its 510-hp, twin-turbo V-12 and the S63 AMG, which has a 518-hp V-8 under its hood. These are pretty heady power figures for a full-size luxury sedan, but not counting the AMG versions they’re relatively similar to what competitors from Audi, BMW and Jaguar offer; big horsepower is a prerequisite in this class.\n\nEven if you choose the “base” S550 with its 5.5-liter V-8, you’re still going to be in for a performance treat. This V-8 engine is what you might call a strong, silent type; it’s powerful and makes this big sedan lunge forward when you mash the gas pedal to the floor. Mercedes-Benz cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.4 seconds for the S550, which is stunning considering the sedan’s 4,465-pound curb weight. The more powerful versions are quicker still, with times in the mid- to low-4-second range. That’s Chevrolet Corvette territory.\n\nThe S550’s V-8 drives a seven-speed automatic transmission that, like the engine, performs in a purposeful, quiet way. In many cars you feel when a shift occurs, but in the S550 the only hint that it’s happened is when the V-8 gets even quieter with the drop in engine speed. The transmission includes Mercedes’ Touch Shift clutchless-manual mode, which lets you select gears by pressing buttons on the back of the steering wheel.\n\nGas mileage for the S550 is more like what you might expect for a full-size SUV; the rear-wheel-drive S550 gets an EPA-estimated 14/21 mpg city/highway, but with the optional 4Matic all-wheel-drive system it drops slightly to 14/20 mpg. Not surprisingly, it’s even lower — 11/17 mpg — if you choose the S600 or one of the AMG models. Most typical car buyers would see this as a significant negative, but here the frequent visits to the gas station are likely to be nothing more than a slight inconvenience for the owner of one of these six-figure cars.\n\nSurprising Agility\nAt 17 feet long, the S550 is obviously a large car, but it doesn’t feel the least bit ponderous from the driver’s seat. It’s pretty easy to maneuver through heavy, fast-moving highway traffic and feels rock-solid doing so, like nothing’s going to move it off its line.\n\nThe big Benz also delivers a comfortable ride. An adaptive air suspension is standard on the S550, and it gives the sedan load-leveling capability as well as a lower ride height when traveling fast.\n\nThe sedan’s size is most noticeable when you maneuver in tight spaces. Fortunately, there are a number of optional features that can lessen your chances of scuffing one of the bumpers, like front and rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Even with such aids, though, the S-Class can still sometimes feel like a giant when parking.\n\nYour Den, On Wheels\nThe S-Class’ cabin mixes classic luxury cues with modern technology features. It also includes the kind of details you’d expect in this segment, like a leather instrument panel cover and classy chrome power window buttons. Beautiful burl walnut wood graces the dash, doors and center console, the latter of which incorporates one of the S-Class’ techno gizmos: the Comand controller.\n\nA large silver dial, the controller can be rotated and nudged in various directions to navigate menus on a large screen in the middle of the dash. Think of it as a universal remote control for your car’s various features, but with a large joystick and a few buttons. Mercedes isn’t the only luxury automaker with this kind of system — Audi has its Multi Media Interface and BMW introduced the world to the concept with iDrive — but Comand is one of the more user-friendly versions.\n\nIts primary advantage is the intuitive arrangement of menus on the screen that will have even new users comfortable with its operation in a matter of minutes. Whereas iDrive has you wishing for some regular buttons to control the vehicle’s settings, Comand shows you the value this kind of thing can have when done right.\n\nA few days into my test drive, though, the system’s cursor began intermittently jumping between menus on its own, which made it difficult to control. With a little less than 3,000 miles on the odometer, this issue would hopefully be under warranty, but it makes you question how well a high-tech system like Comand will hold up long-term.\n\nThe S-Class is also available with some of the most advanced front seats ever. The optional Drive-Dynamic multicontour seats have numerous adjustments, thanks in part to air chambers in the seats. They also include a massage mode and can inflate the side bolsters when cornering to help keep you in place. Some of the settings can be adjusted using the Comand system, but the more traditional controls, like cushion position, are in easy reach on the door panel. Fancy adjustments wouldn’t mean much if the seats weren’t comfortable, but they are, in a large, soft, leather easy-chair type of way.\n\nMaybe you’re more interested in being driven than in driving. If that’s the case, the S-Class has you covered with its massive backseat. It offers tons of legroom and a backrest that’s angled backward for optimal comfort. Power-adjustable rear seats are optional.\n\nWhat makes the S-Class a bit different from most of its competitors is that this expansive backseat is standard; unlike the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Lexus LS 460, you don’t have to buy a long-wheelbase model to get it. Even though there are seat belts for three, it’s clear the backseat is designed for two, as there is a large hump in the middle of the floor, and the middle seat’s cushioning is hard compared to the outer seats’.\n\nHigh-Tech Features\nOptional high-end gadgets include Night View Assist, which can “see” almost 500 feet ahead of the car and display the view in the instrument panel. Equally interesting is the available Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control system. If you’re one of the legions of drivers who find themselves stuck in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic on a daily basis, Distronic Plus might be just what you need to ease the morning and evening commute. This system will brake and accelerate the S-Class as necessary to keep it moving through heavy traffic, and it can even bring the car to a complete stop if necessary. We know of no other manufacturer with a feature this comprehensive.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, front and rear side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags and Pre-Safe. By monitoring the braking, steering and stability systems, Pre-Safe can ready occupants for a collision by tightening the seat belts, adjusting the position of the front passenger seat and available power rear seats, and closing the windows. The more advanced Pre-Safe Brake system, which requires the optional Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control system, can brake the S-Class automatically if the system deems there is a chance for an accident.\n\nS-Class in the Market\nThe S-Class is up against some very good competition in the full-size luxury sedan category, including the LS 460, which starts significantly below the Mercedes’ $86,700 base price. The S-Class and its competitors aren’t vying for any value awards, though; they’re designed to offer consumers a high level of performance and luxury. In this the S-Class succeeds, and it remains a leader in this exclusive slice of the market and a favorite here at Cars.com.\n\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The full-size S-Class sedans from Mercedes-Benz are getting a bit long in the tooth — a successor model is due to be unveiled this fall at the Frankfurt show — but the big four-door remains a formidable presence in the luxury market in terms of size, comfort, safety and advanced technology.\n\nWe tested a 2005 S430 4Matic with all-wheel drive (a no-cost option) and a sticker of $79,430.\n\nSHE: I noticed the salon where you’ve been getting your hair cut lately is looking for a “nail technician.” But that’s only half the battle. What they also need is a chair just like the front seats in the S430. They’re so plush and loaded with gizmos, including power adjustable lumbar support, they remind me of the fancy pedicure chairs at high-end spas. I loved that gathered nappa leather, which is an $840 option. And we didn’t even have the uber-seats with the active ventilation and massage features. But the car’s exterior design — not stylish at all! I’d call it almost frumpy.\n\nHE: Gee, I guess you nailed it. The S-Class has never been a car for younger drivers. Mercedes likes to promote it as the perfect status vehicle for those who have “arrived.” So there traditionally has been more emphasis on the interior than the exterior. Nor is this really a driver’s car, a role that falls more on the shoulders of the BMW 7 Series in this price segment. The S-Class is more about the ride quality, which is pretty smooth and buttery, thanks to the air suspension and automatic damping. If you hadn’t spotted the 4Matic badge on the decklid, you’d be hard-pressed to tell this is a four-wheel-drive vehicle because the S430 delivers a real luxury-car ride. It’s more about comfort than precise control, which is not a strong suit. In fact, driving the S430 is a little like piloting a cruise ship; you sort of point it in the direction you’d like to go, and it generally follows without too much protest.\n\nSHE: That might be overstating the case. I didn’t find steering the S430 to be any more of a challenge than driving a big domestic model, like a Cadillac DTS or a Lincoln Town Car. It does have a surprising amount of power from the 4.3-liter V-8, which makes 275 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes has matched the V-8 with a five-speed Tiptronic automatic, which you can shift like a manual, but the car isn’t really conducive to that because it feels so big and heavy. I guess “ponderous” would be the word that comes to mind. Be forewarned, too, that the powerful V-8 and the S430’s massive curb weight of 4,390 pounds extract a stiff penalty in terms of fuel economy — so stiff that you have to pay a federal gas-guzzler tax of $1,000 up front when you buy the car. And with EPA ratings of 17/22, you might as well be driving a big SUV.\n\nHE: There are certainly trade-offs. You have lots of power available under your right foot, but like many of the Mercedes products we’ve driven, there is a noticeable and annoying throttle lag when you’re trying to kick the transmission down and get extra power for passing. On the other hand, this lives up to Mercedes tradition in providing an amazing complement of safety equipment, including full side air bags and side cushions, as well as BabySmart seats, antilock brakes, electronic stability program and the company’s fabulous PRE-SAFE system that anticipates an impending collision and puts the vehicle’s safety systems on red alert.\n\nSHE: I like Mercedes’ version of OnStar, which they call TeleAid, although when we tested it, it took the remote operator about 10 rings to answer a call. So I suppose you’re right about trade-offs. Like the trunk, which is cavernous and comes with neat features like a cargo net and built-in Velcro straps for securing smaller items. But where’s the split folding rear seat for stowing longer stuff? The power trunk lid has a cool disappearing handle and pulls itself shut, but it flies open awfully quickly, too; I almost clunked my jaw on it. But I was impressed by some of the attention to detail inside the car, especially in the roomy rear compartment. The back seat has individual vanity mirrors, reading lights, vents and cup holders.\n\nHE: The S430 is not for everyone. I think its chief appeal probably lies with older, more affluent customers looking for adequate power, lots of features and just a little more status than they’d get with a Cadillac or a Lincoln.\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor-based automotive information services company.\n\n– – –\n\n2005 Mercedes-Benz S430 4Matic\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $77,020 (inc. $720 destination charge and $1,000 gas-guzzler tax); as tested, $79,430.\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V-8; 275-hp; 295 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/22 mpg highway.\n\nWhere built: Germany.\n\nKey competitors: Acura RL, Audi A8, BMW 750Li, Cadillac DTS, Cadillac STS, Infiniti Q45, Jaguar XJ, Lexus LS 430, Lincoln Town Car, Maserati Quattroporte, Mercedes-Benz CLS500, Volvo S80.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,936. (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nAnita’s rating: 4\n\nLikes: Front seats look like they came from a high-end spa. All-wheel drive at no extra charge. Powerful V-8 engine. Roomy rear compartment with many amenities. Great warranty package. Love the built-in Velcro straps in the trunk to secure smaller items. Beautiful chrome thresholds on all four doors.\n\nDislikes: Exterior design is frumpy. At nearly $80,000, one of the most expensive luxury sedans in the class. $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nPaul’s rating: 4\n\nLikes: Comfort in spades. Air suspension, adjustable damping make for buttery ride. Terrific safety features, including full air-bag protection, stability program and more. Gorgeous wood trim in cabin.\n\nDislikes: Handles more like a cruise ship than a sports car. Noticeable throttle lag when transmission kicks down. CD changer is virtually inaccessible in the trunk. Navigation/audio system requires too much attention from driver.\n\nRating system\n\n1. Unacceptable, 2. Subpar, 3. Acceptable, 4. Above average, 5. World class",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 about the 2015 Mercedes-Benz S550. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Mercedes-Benz S550 coupe is an opulent car that backs up its six-figure price with its blend of performance, comfort and stunning looks.\n\nJust paying a lot for something doesn’t necessarily mean your money will be well-spent. Other times, though, spending a lot of money can get you a markedly better experience than you would otherwise get.\n\nSo it is with Mercedes’ newest luxury coupe.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic coupe that, with options and its $925 delivery charge, cost $135,375. The S550 coupe competes with other luxury coupes such as the Bentley Continental GT and the BMW 6 Series. Compare them here. The S550 Coupe was introduced for the 2015 model year.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile Mercedes calls the car a coupe version of the S-Class, it shares no sheet metal with the big S-Class sedan. It’s better to think of the S550 coupe as the successor to the CL-Class luxury coupe that Mercedes sold as recently as the 2014 model year.\n\nWhatever you consider it, the S550 coupe is a stunner. It’s wide, low and long with an upright grille that calls to mind older Mercedes-Benz coupes, particularly the classic 300SL (you know, the one with gull-wing doors). It’s a good look, both because it looks good and because it calls to mind the brand’s heritage.\n\nThe pillarless side window design is also a plus. There’s no structure between the A-pillars that flank the windshield and the pillars on either side of the rear window, and this really gives a graceful look to the coupe’s profile.\n\nOverall, the S550 coupe reminds you just how good-looking a coupe can be — and how gawky looking some four-door sedans with coupe styling can be.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe S550 shines at covering vast distances in comfort at highway (or faster) speeds. A lot of this comfort comes down to the car’s standard Airmatic air suspension. That suspension is also offered as an option on other Mercedes-Benz models and features Comfort and Sport settings.\n\nI’ve tested many Mercedes models with the air suspension, and in general I find it to work very well. On the S550 coupe, it absorbs every bump while still letting the car feel planted. It’s not just that the ride is smooth, it’s that you can be taking a turn at 45 mph and hit a bump and the car just makes a sound and keeps tracking through the turn. There’s just such a turn on my drive home and, in other cars, it’s always an adventure. In the S550, it’s a non-event. This is true whether the suspension is set in Comfort or Sport.\n\nIn addition to the suspension, the engine and transmission can be adjusted to either Efficient or Sport. In Efficient, the car starts from a standstill in 2nd gear and shifts into upper gears quickly to save fuel. In Sport, the car starts in 1st and holds onto gears longer. Both work as advertised, and you do notice a difference between the two settings, though the engine will respond quickly if need be while the car is set to Efficient.\n\nSporty driving, though, is not the S550 coupe’s forte. Specifically, quick, darting changes on twisty roads are not what it’s best at, even with the suspension and engine set to Sport.\n\nFor buyers who want to scream through corners and have money to spend on an expensive coupe, there’s also the 2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT. You can read our initial impressions of that car here. I think the presence of that road-scorching beast in the lineup helps the S550 coupe, because now it doesn’t have to be all things to all people. Instead of trying to be both sporty and comfy, the S550 coupe can serve as the comfortable, heavy grand tourer.\n\nSpeaking of weight, another editor pointed out that the S550 coupe weighs roughly as much as a Ford F-150 we tested at the same time, which gives you an idea of how heavy this big coupe is. However, it’s also worth noting that the S550 coupe has both more horsepower (449 vs. 385) and — more importantly — more torque (516 pounds-feet vs. 375) than the brutish pickup truck. So the Mercedes is heavy, but it’s also got the muscle to move its mass.\n\nThe S550 coupe is EPA-estimated to get 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined. Premium gasoline is required.\n\nBut for all the power and big numbers, driving the S550 is more about spending hours behind the wheel and not feeling stressed or tired. Specs don’t do it justice, because this is the area in which the S550 really excels.\n\nIn addition to the suspension, another — often overlooked — reason for this is that the S550 coupe does an excellent job of eliminating outside noises. As one reviewer put it, “I wish I could invite the S550 engineers over to my house for some home improvements.”\n\nMercedes does allow some engine noise to come into the cabin when the car is pushed, and it’s a good, snarling sound with a nice, muscular note when the car shifts gears. It’s especially gratifying when you learn the sound is all natural, as opposed to the fake, stereo-augmented sounds that are becoming more common in the market.\n\nInterior\nIf you’re claustrophobic, this is the car to help set your mind at ease. The S550 coupe is the brightest, most open-feeling car I’ve ever been in, short of a convertible. That’s partly because the S550 coupe has a large moonroof that extends well toward the rear of the car. The more I drove it, though, the more I realized the open feeling was down to the coupe’s “pillarless” design.\n\nWhere other cars have a structure (a B-pillar) between the windshield and rear-roof pillars, the S550 coupe has just a thin strip of weatherproofing where the front and rear side windows meet. It’s amazing how much this opens up the interior and gives you a truly panoramic view. Taken with that massive moonroof, I often felt like I was gliding along in a glass-canopied car of the future.\n\nYet all is not excellent when it comes to visibility: The A-pillars block views of pedestrians badly. This is due more to the angle of the pillars than to their width, but on more than one occasion I found myself having to work to peer around the pillar to be absolutely certain nobody was there.\n\nAside from that, the S550 coupe inspires confidence. Within a few moments, I felt I knew exactly where the front, sides and rear of the car were. I was ready to make the tight squeezes and sharp turns that are the norm in downtown Chicago, where we’re based. That’s a significant benefit when you’re driving a coupe that’s longer and almost as wide as a midsize Mercedes-Benz ML350 SUV.\n\nIn terms of quality, the S550’s interior is quite good. Our test model came with an optional designo leather package that suited the car, even though its white color wouldn’t be my preference. It’s worth noting that the package costs an extra $3,250, but even if money were no object I think I’d still be tempted to see what the standard interior covering looked like.\n\nBeyond that, there was real wood trim that managed to look good because the graining was subtle, and the glossy finish suited a luxury car. Too often, there are too many knots and grains in the wood, almost as if the automaker feels compelled to shout, “Yes, this is real wood!” Far better to have the material look good and actually feel like wood in my book, and that’s what Mercedes has done.\n\nThe S550 is a comfortable car to sit in up front. There’s plenty of room, and I was able to find a suitable driving position quite quickly. That’s not always the case for me in coupes. Our test model also had power seats that offered massage and active bolstering — meaning that when you turn into a corner, air bladders in the seat inflate to hold you in position.\n\nI tried both systems and found the active bolstering to be an odd, unsettling sensation, so I switched it off. The massage function — and the range of massages it offers — I used extensively in my test. They were definitely effective. They turned the last 15 minutes of a grinding, stop-and-go, three-hour drive into a pleasurable, de-stressing experience.\n\nWhile I might not spend the money on the designo leather, I could easily see spending the $3,500 you’ll have to pay to add the package with the massaging seats.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the S550 has rear seats and, in a pinch, we hauled an adult back there — but not without the front-seat passenger giving up a significant amount of space. It’s really a car for two people.\n\nOther editors and I noticed that when we had the seat positioned properly for our driving, the top of the steering wheel blocked the top of the gauge cluster, making it impossible to read the speedometer at highway speeds. Fortunately, the S550 had a head-up display (included in the $3,500 option package with the massaging seats), but without spending that extra money the gauges would be hard to read. That, also, could have been done better.\n\nNotable interior options on our test model included the designo leather package ($3,250), plus a heated steering wheel, heated center armrest and heated front and rear seats ($1,990).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMost of what Mercedes stuffs into the S550 coupe here is quite good. The sole exception is the Comand system’s touch-sensitive controller, which is very sensitive and located in just such a place that it often responds to your touch when you don’t want it to. It has its useful features — notably the way it allows you to pull up your music source no matter what screen you’re on — but overall I found the touch-sensitive area frustrating.\n\nLikewise, the Comand system used to have sections along the bottom and top of the screen that allowed you to easily switch between, say, navigation and music. That’s now gone, and you must first nudge the rotary controller to make those sections show up, which means you also stand a good chance of hitting the touch-sensitive portion when you don’t mean to. I think this could be better.\n\nPart of what makes this so frustrating is that, once you’re in the menu you want to be in, the Comand system works quickly and is intuitive. Changing everything from the interior ambient lighting to the seat’s support settings is quite easy; it’s just that you may need a healthy amount of patience to get to the menu you need.\n\nFortunately, Mercedes offers buttons in the center console that allow you to shortcut to some settings, including the seats, navigation, vehicle settings and so forth. This was very well-done.\n\nOverall, Comand is like any other automakers’ multimedia/control screen in that it has its quirks. I don’t rank it at the head of the class, but I find it superior to the systems from Lexus and Cadillac.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe S550 coupe offers a large trunk that would be suitable for two people — even heavy-packing people — to take a long vacation.\n\nInside the cabin, again, the S550 coupe offers enough storage for two people, as the center console is large for a vehicle in this class.\n\nSafety\nAs is often the case with low-volume luxury cars, the Mercedes-Benz S550 coupe has not been crash-tested by our preferred organization, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Further, while the S-Class sedan has been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the coupe we drove has not been.\n\nThere was a large complement of safety options on our test model, most grouped under Mercedes’ $2,800 Driver Assistance Package. That package includes adaptive cruise control — branded Distronic Plus with Steering Assist — which can help keep the car centered in its lane on straight roads, maintain a set distance between the S550 and a car ahead, and bring the car to a complete stop. It also includes a blind spot monitoring system that can guide the car back into your lane if you attempt to merge into an occupied lane; a lane-keeping system that vibrates the steering wheel and can use the brakes to “steer” the car back into your lane if you stray; braking that scans the road ahead and can recognize pedestrians and apply the brakes at speeds less than 35 mph (branded Pre-Safe Brake with Pedestrian Recognition); and a system that scans the road and alerts drivers if it senses an impending collision at speeds of 45 mph or less (that one’s called BAS Plus with Cross-Traffic Assist).\n\nThe lane warning and lane-keeping systems kicked in a few times during my test. When the S550 coupe warns that you’re straying from your lane, there’s a slight vibration through the steering wheel, as if you’re running over the reflectors that often line roads. If you don’t correct your course and the active system kicks in; the vibrations become more severe and you feel the car tug itself back into the lane. It’s obtrusive — you’ll notice it — but because this is a safety system alerting you to something you’re doing wrong, I don’t mind that. Bear in mind, though, the system works only on straight roads; I found it wouldn’t kick in when there was even the slightest bend in the road.\n\nIn addition to those safety features, we also had the aforementioned $3,500 Premium Package that included the massaging seats, head-up display and a surround-view camera that provided numerous views — including a 360-degree overhead view — when parking. I found the cameras fun to use when pulling into the many tight spaces that make up Chicago. But as I said, I found visibility in the car to be good. I didn’t need to rely on the cameras, but they were nice to have as backup. Our tester also had Mercedes’ Night View Assist Plus that cost $2,260, though I was unable to test that system.\n\nBrowse the S550’s entire list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhen you consider the $135,375 price of our S550 coupe test model, “value” with this car clearly means value relative to the class. It’s not a synonym for low price, because this thing ain’t cheap.\n\nStill, I really believe it lives up to the price it commands. Not only did I think it was very good-looking, it turned heads during my test drive, and that’s unusual for any car we test. Its ride over Chicago’s horrid roads was, simply, unbelievably good. And its ability to cover hundreds of miles in silence, while offering a panoramic view of the world as it whips by, is unparalleled. Another reviewer summed it up this way: “[It] feels more like driving a boutique luxury automaker’s one-off concept car than something you can get serviced around the corner at a local Mercedes dealership.” I don’t disagree.\n\nMy quibble is that I really would want to spend the full $135,000 for the loaded version I drove, rather than opt for the “base” model at $120,825.\n\nWe can only test what they give us, but I can’t help thinking that our inability to see the tops of the gauges would be much more annoying without the optional head-up display. And wouldn’t that three-hour grind have been much more stressful without the optional massaging seats? Getting those features means spending thousands of dollars more to get the ultimate experience the S550 coupe can offer.\n\nWhen all is said and done, though, if you can afford the cost and options you’ll get a beautiful, impressive ride that belongs in the highest class of luxury cars.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Luxury comes with nuances.\n\nLittle things denote one fine ride: The look of the thread on the dashboard stitching, the smell of the leather, the crystal-like headlamps. Even the sound of the trunk sealing itself closed after you push a button and walk to the driver’s door it all projects luxury.\n\nKnowing and understanding that some things in life are, well, just better is the gift of luxury. And some cars are better than others.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class thrives in this knowledge. For generations, well-heeled boys have enjoyed this low spark of understanding and the hidden treasures of a well-made machine. The S-Class is pretty nice. It is the same as it ever was.\n\nThe S-Class has been one of the most revolutionary vehicles ever to hit the autobahn it defines the future with radical firsts that become commonplace for the unwashed nameplates.\n\nThe 2011 Mercedes-Benz S400 hybrid, however, is not as likely to follow a similar path. This is the S-Class sedan that is following, not leading.\n\nOf course, at $91,000, it’s the least expensive S-Class. It’s also the most fuel-efficient, reaching 19 mpg city and 25 mpg highway with the first lithium-ion battery pack for the mild hybrid system. (By comparison, the $158,925 S600 gets 12 mpg city and 19 mpg highway.)\n\nThis is one of the inherent problems with a mild hybrid system on a big vehicle. While the improvements are considerable percentage-wise (30 percent better for the S400), the overall number doesn’t sound very impressive.\n\nReally, it is the 25 mpg highway is a big jump from the other S-Class models. But hybrid fullsize pickups offer similar mileage improvements with little public acceptance. If the word “hybrid” is slapped onto the trunk and front fenders, people expect the vehicle to produce big mileage numbers. Reality and physics rarely meet consumers’ expectations.\n\nThe system is “mild” because it is not like other hybrids that can power the car at higher speeds on electric power only. The electric motor assists the gas engine, giving it a big boost.\n\nThe system also incorporates a start-stop system that cuts off the engine but seamlessly keeps running everything else. The hybrid system, which also includes regenerative braking to push electricity back into the battery, works with the German precision you’d expect.\n\nQuiet intelligence\n\nAnd don’t underestimate the S400’s Mercedes pedigree. It is pure Mercedes from bumper to bumper.\n\nIt still has that weighty luxury feel to its ride and handling. On the road, its gas-electric powertrain offers nearly 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque between its 3.5-liter V-6 and electric motor. That’s more than enough power to get the 4,474-pound sedan moving. According to Mercedes, the S400 goes from 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds and has a top speed of 130 mph.\n\nAgain, good but certainly not eye-popping.\n\nThe independent suspension and speed-sensitive, power-assisted, rack-and-pinion steering is well weighted. The S400 glides more than it rides. Its 124-inch wheelbase sucks up nearly every bump on the road in near silence. Also, the smaller engine (it’s the only S-Class sedan with a V-6) and electric motor make the S400 nearly silent on the road.\n\nAnd the S400 still comes with the many of the S-Class’ safety features, one area in which Mercedes continues to lead the world. This car can detect if you’re falling asleep, monitor your lane awareness correcting the driver if you start to slip out of your lane and keep the car straight in heavy crosswinds.\n\nThis car includes a radar system that will let you use cruise control in the Mercedes, it’s called Distronic Plus cruise control even in thick traffic. It can actually bring the S400 to a full stop and then start up the car and move along before stopping again. There’s no reason a Mercedes driver should be bothered with touching the accelerator or brake in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nThe radar system also creates a blind spot detection system that prevents you from moving into a lane with a car trailing in your blind spot. The radar is also part of Mercedes’ Pre-Safe system that will detect when the car is about to be in an accident.\n\nIn the few seconds before a collision, the car will apply full brakes, tighten the seat belts, adjust the seats in the car for a safer position, and close the windows and sunroof if the car thinks there’s potential for a rollover. All of these adjustments can help save the lives of a driver and passengers.\n\nSimple control\n\nAnd inside the S400, few will be disappointed.\n\nThe comfortable plush leather seats and simple, luxurious instrument panel are impeccable.\n\nThere’s a certain understated appeal that the S400 offers. Luxury, in the case of the S-Class, is never in your face.\n\nBut it’s found in the high-resolution, 61/2-inch screen at the top of the center stack controlled by the single knob on the center console. The metal wheel is easy to use by either spinning it or moving it forward and aft to move on the screen.\n\nIt’s known as the Mercedes Command system, and it takes only a few minutes to get used to.\n\nMore importantly, the S400’s interior is extremely roomy and comfortable in the front and back.\n\nThe S400 also takes on more aggressive looks with the redesign of the S-Class for the 2010 model year.\n\nThe well-proportioned body stretches out to create a low and long profile. The front end was toughened up, and the S400 includes special 18-inch wheels.\n\nIt’s the nuances of the S400 that make this car look so nice.\n\nA truly luxurious vehicle is like obscenity you might not always know how to define it, but you know it when you see it.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ***\n\nExterior: Good. Aggressive and well proportioned exterior holds up its German pedigree while the hybrid badges provide some eco-cred.\n\nInterior: Excellent: Well appointed with all the high-tech features a driver would want.\n\nPerformance: Good. Luxurious ride and enough power to keep the S400 rolling. High-tech safety features abound.\n\nPros: Cutting-edge safety features and hybrid status provide better mileage.\n\nCons: Still not high-mileage numbers.\n\n**** Excellen *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM —  As the auto world shifts to SUVs, it’s easy to forget the pleasure unique to a big, powerful luxury car. But not when you’re at the wheel of a deliciously decadent 2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan.\n\nRelated: 2019 Audi A8: Redesigned Flagship Sedan Revealed\n\nThe 2018 is a mid-cycle refresh of the redesigned 2014 S-Class with design tweaks and incremental improvements to its impressive array of technology — plus, most importantly, four new or updated engines. Mercedes calculates 1,600 new parts in the 2018, with the new engines counting as just one part. But the whole is greater than the sum of those parts, and the S-Class sedan, in all its variations, remains a statement as much as a car. Buyers don’t just want to arrive, they want to say they’ve arrived.\n\nThe refreshed 2018 comes as new competition is on the horizon — particularly the new Audi A8, with its gee-whiz driving assistance technology unveiled recently in Spain and due in the U.S. next year.\n\nWe drove the S-Class at a Mercedes-Benz event in New York City and on the meandering byways of the tony Connecticut suburbs — the natural habitat of the S-Class, which does 20 percent of its total sales in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay our travel and lodging expenses for such automaker events.)  So natural, in fact, that at a stop in busy downtown Greenwich, Conn., a Mercedes official directing the cars into reserved spaces snagged an S-Class sedan that wasn’t one of ours. \n\nThe biggest changes for 2018 are under the hood, starting with a new V-6 base engine, a 362-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter in the S450. Next up is an all-new 463-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 in the S560 and Maybach S560. It includes cylinder deactivation and fuel efficiency is up around 10 percent from the 4.7-liter V-8 it replaces to 17/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined in the S 560. Both get a new nine-speed conventional automatic. All-wheel drive with a rear-drive bias is optional (standard on the Maybach). The 4.0-liter is amped up to 602 horsepower for the AMG S63. It gets an AMG-clutched version of the nine-speed automatic, and torque-shifting all-wheel-drive is standard. Mercedes’ venerable 621-hp, twin-turbo V-12 powers the AMG S65 and Maybach S650, with a seven-speed automatic and only rear-wheel drive.\n\nWe had time in two versions: a 602-hp AMG S63 V-8 performance sedan and tamer, but still powerful, 463-hp V-8 S560 with all-wheel drive. The family also includes the V-6 S450, V-12 S65 and stretched (about 8 inches), limo-like Maybach sedans with V-8 or V-12 engines. Pricing starts at $90,895 with shipping for a base S450, but it quickly climbs into six figures.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nWhile they vary in personality, all S-Class variants excel at their core job: smooth, comfortable performance befitting the luxurious and whisper-quiet cabin, whether cruising highways or navigating Manhattan’s traffic and rough streets with above-it-all composure.\n\nHandling was competent with the S560 test car and more so with the AMG-tuned chassis of the S63 muscle car, but it’s still a 2-and-half-ton sedan and carving canyon roads is not in its DNA, nor is it likely to be for most of its buyers.\n\nThat said, the two test cars provided very different experiences, each enjoyable in its own way. The S560 had plenty of power on tap (zero-to-60 mph is rated at 4.6 seconds), but the V-8 was barely heard. Its nine-speed automatic was responsive but seemed tuned to be unobtrusive. The car’s adaptive air suspension made road imperfections all but disappear thanks in part to a body control system that uses a stereo camera to scan the road ahead for potholes and other hazards and adjusts the suspension accordingly. It doesn’t, however, alter wheel movement to the extent of the system in the coming Audi A8. The Mercedes’ control system also moderates body shift in acceleration and braking, but the serenity of it all can make you feel a bit disconnected.\n\nThe S63 is a different animal — still a comfortable cruiser, but with neck-snapping acceleration on tap at most any speed. Zero-to-60 mph using launch control arrives in just 3.4 seconds. The AMG version of the nine-speed automatic clicked off shifts crisply on its own or via the paddles and downshifted willingly, dropping gears at the slightest provocation — and with crackling, popping exhaust notes in Sport Plus driving mode. And despite its wet clutch in place of a traditional torque converter, it was well-behaved in traffic. The S63’s AMG-tuned air suspension was just as comfortable in most situations as the S560, even in Sport, Sport Plus and Comfort modes, but you feel more in touch with the road; there also is a configurable custom mode. The braking with 15.4-inch discs and six-piston calipers up front was impressive.\n\nThe S63 performance was so impressive that I had to ask why Mercedes still offers the 6.0-liter V-12 AMG S65 brute, which is 0.7 seconds slower to 60 mph, has the older seven-speed automatic and does not offer all-wheel drive to help harness the 621 horses and 738 pounds-feet of torque. A Mercedes official pointed to the V-12 badge on the fender and said it’s demand from buyers who want the “ultimate.” Apparently, that’s not the ultimate performance of the S63, but rather the cachet of a V-12 and its unique exhaust note — not to mention the most chrome on its face of any S-Class sedan.\n\nSafety and Assistance Tech Pushes Level 2\n\nThe already ample offerings of S-Class driver assistance technology is refined further in the 2018, with the sensor systems looking farther ahead and behind the car, building on some of the advances first seen in the redesigned E-Class sedan last year. The adaptive cruise control now employs navigation GPS and map data to adjust speed for upcoming curves, turns and intersections (and, if you choose, follow speed limit changes). It takes a while to trust, but the system worked smoothly in my testing.\n\nSteering assist also is advanced beyond previous lane centering to handle tighter curves, more speeds and degraded lane markings, as well as assisting in keeping control in evasive swerves. It also now includes an automatic lane change: Press the turn signal and the car will search for a safe opening, including checking the speed of more distant approaching vehicles, and then change lanes on its own.\n\nThe overall package pushes the envelope of Level 2 autonomous driving but is more conservative than some of the coming A8’s Level 3 autonomous technology, though it’s not clear how that will be deployed in the U.S.\n\nMake It Your Own, for a Price\n\nThe exterior design changes are subtle, though enough for Mercedes cognoscenti to spot the 2018’s new front and rear bumpers, grilles, wheels and lighting.\n\nThere are more functional changes inside, the most obvious being the simpler dashboard with a single glass panel that spans the two 12.3-inch screens: a center screen handling multimedia and vehicle control functions, and a configurable instrument and information display in front of the driver. The multimedia system remains controlled by voice, a touchpad or knob controller and shortcut buttons. It sounds complicated, but in practice it was easy to use and kept distraction to a minimum.\n\nA new steering wheel includes touch-sensitive buttons (like tiny touchpads) at the right and left that can be used to control most of the car’s screens and systems. I had to master the right touch, but I ended up liking the utility of the new buttons. The sophisticated cruise control now moves to the new steering wheel, marking goodbye to Mercedes’ unique cruise-control stalk.\n\nBut spotting the 2018 design changes is complicated by a dizzying array of appearance options and special upholstery and trim packages that let the buyer, for a price, personalize their new ride inside and out. That’s along with a myriad of pampering and technology options and rear-seat packages.\n\nChecking the boxes makes it yours, but it also quickly balloons the price. The well-optioned S560 test car grew from $103,895 with shipping to $134,455, while the AMG S63 test car weighed in at $183,995 with nearly $40,000 in extras, from additional performance upgrades to rear-seat entertainment, and including matte-gray paint and blacked-out trim that didn’t look altogether comfortable to my eye on an S-Class sedan (but would look great on a Dodge Charger).\n\nThe Silly Stuff\n\nPart of the fun of such a full-out luxury car is some features no one really needs but can surprise and delight anyway. The S-Class has no shortage. Among them are 64 color choices for the interior ambient lights, with a choice of intensity and zone. And the light show is all around you, from the dash and doors to speakers and footwells.\n\nYou can add a rear seatback refrigerator, too, if you’re willing to sacrifice a big piece of trunk space. And the Maybach offers a $3,000 silver champagne flute option.\n\nBut perhaps the most novel is the Energizing Comfort system purported to promote wellness. It lets you select a holistic cabin atmosphere with 10-minute sessions to perk up or calm down your mood. The center display graphic shows you a choice of six packages: Freshness, Warmth, Vitality, Joy, Comfort and Training, which has three routines. They combine preprogrammed music with an appropriate beat, cabin aromatherapy, seat massage settings, seat heating and ventilation, and ambient lighting for suitable rejuvenation. The system also can scan your personal music for appropriate beats. We went for Vitality; Warmth seemed too relaxing for safety, but the novelty wore off quickly for me.\n\nBuy or Wait?\n\nMost S-Class models are on sale now, with the AMG S65, the S560 rear-wheel-drive version and Maybach S650 V-12 due by the end of the year. A 2018 S560e plug-in hybrid, unveiled in Germany in September, will arrive in the U.S. in mid-2018, Mercedes-Benz officials said.\n\nThe differences with the coming new A8 are so much at the high-tech margins, particularly the driver assistance systems, that whether to wait may be as much a matter of aesthetics and emotional response as any feature — i.e., which car would get your juices going just sitting in your driveway. For my money, you could not go wrong, depending on your tastes, with either the S560 or AMG S63 available right now.",

      "expert_review": "2004 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG Kompressor\nMuscle plus luxury, for $131,000\n\nTime to suspend reality.\n\nSuspend the notion that many of us could ever afford to buy this car at $131,000.\n\nSuspend the notion that, even if we could, there would be an American Autobahn out there somewhere on which we could hammer it to the hilt — that being 0-60 miles per hour in 4.6 seconds — and reach a cruising speed approaching 160 miles per hour.\n\nBut the reality is that here is a luxury sedan — and I am talking luxury that surpasses that of your basic million-dollar Manhattan apartment — that is a flat-out muscle car.\n\nI can talk about leather, burnished wood, heated/cooled seats front and rear, legroom for Bill Walton, seats that change shape and grip as your speed and cornering change, and suspension that changes with all of that. But first I need to tell you about the heart of this beast.\n\nThe 2004 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG (AMG translated from German to Maine-speak means, ”Make this cah as powahful and fast as a competative lobstah boat”) is powered by a V-8 engine that features 24 valves, two ignition coils, and two spark plugs per cylinder. All that is boosted by a high-pressure supercharger that is liquid-intercooled, meaning the air that finally hits the compression chamber is cooled, super-packed, and explosive. But how do you transmit 493 horsepower, and, more critically, 516 lb.-ft. of gear-eating torque, to the rear drive wheels? In many forms.\n\nStart with an electronic five-speed transmission. Then add goodies.\n\nLeave it alone and it shifts for you, seamlessly, without reaching any scary edges of performance. Click into manual and you can shift up or down with a left or right flick of the stick. Use Optimum and all you need do is hold the shifter left of drive for a second and the car upshifts and downshifts for best performance and engine braking. Go into a driver-selected Comfort mode and the car will start out in second, to save gas and limit takeoff, and use two gears in reverse. It’s all about sane driving — as if that will happen.\n\nToss in AMG SpeedShift, which is purported to be 35 percent faster than manual, and the car almost drives itself. It will automatically downshift in heavy braking, and it won’t allow an upshift in the middle of heavy cornering. The last can be a terrifying event, as I experienced with a bad driver in a fast car on a high California mountain road (no guardrails, 2,000-plunge to the right) as he upshifted at apex and lost all traction.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the manual shifters built into the steering wheel, allowing thumb-clicks left or right to run through the gears. That wheel is also part of a luxurious, ergonomically wonderful interior. From the wheel you control not only shifts, but audio, information, and navigation systems. Besides great leather and fine wood, the car features functionality in the form of a multilayer center console and a fold-down rear center console, both with storage and cup holders.\n\nFourteen-way power front seats with lumbar support and memory — and heating and cooling systems built in — provide a luxurious, firm ride. Those front seats have pneumatic torso bolsters that respond to speed and cornering and inflate to grip you when speed and cornering get tough.\n\nSound comes from a 12-speaker Bose system that exhibits liquid depth and granite solidity.\n\nSafety features include air bags front and rear with front, side-impact, and head bags. The front bags are weight- and crash-sensitive, meaning they deploy only with the force that the crash and the weight of seat occupants necessitate.\n\nStability is provided by myriad systems that use brakes, throttle, and monitors that watch pitch, yaw, body roll, speed, driver intent, steering angle, and braking to fix the problems.\n\nThis is a big, luxurious German sedan hat will blow the doors off most American sports cars and should be on any enthusiast’s dream list.\n\nBut then reality intrudes.",

      "expert_review": "Since being redesigned in 1991, Mercedes’ flagship sedan, the S500, has been improved every year it has been on the market.\n\nBut is it good enough?\n\nDespite incremental improvements in handling, performance, weight reduction and fuel economy, the S500 is still fuel thirsty and massively heavy.\n\nThe S500 is the automotive equivalent of a luxury ocean liner. It coddles its occupants in supreme comfort, offers them all the room and luxury features they could possibly need, and conveys them to their destination in as safe a package as one can reasonably hope for in an automobile.\n\nBut there is something about this big Benz that makes it feel out of touch and out of sync with today’s world.\n\nMaybe it’s the price, which would be far more than the sticker $92,032 indicates. That’s because of the 10 percent luxury tax applied to all cars with prices greater than $33,000.\n\nMaybe it’s the S500’s considerable girth – it is just more than 17 feet long and it weighs 4,760 pounds.\n\nFor some reason, this car – impressive as it is – left me cold.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe biggest sedan in the Mercedes-Benz lineup is offered with a 315-horsepower, 32-valve V-8 and a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAs with many of the other cars in the Mercedes lineup, the S500 is not particularly quick from a start. It really only begins to deliver stellar performance when the engine is revved high and the car is moving at about 50 mph.\n\nThe cars Mercedes ships to the United States are not geared for American driving conditions. Because there are many roads in Germany with very high speed limits, good 0-to-60 mph performance is not as important as sustained high-speed driving. So a Mercedes doesn’t really get moving until you reach 50 or 60 mph.\n\nBut responsiveness from a stop and strong performance to 60 mph is important to many drivers in the United States. The S500 starts out in second gear. A Mercedes spokesman said it does so to helpthe S500 meet emissions requirements. It will start in first if you bury the accelerator in the carpet, but its shift from second gear to first is somewhat rough. The ’96 model gets a five-speed automatic, so maybe it’ll be a bit more responsive.\n\nSeveral times during my 300 mile test-drive, I moved the shifter into first and manually changed gears. Doing so changed the character of the car. Instead of lethargic acceleration, it moved away briskly from stop lights.\n\nThe 5.0-liter V-8 is about as smooth and quiet as they come. However, it has a tremendous appetite for unleaded premium. Our test car guzzled fuel. I got 13mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway, though I did drive with a fairly heavy foot.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe S500 is one of those cars that generates very little noise as it goes down the road. On a rough surface, such as a brick street, you might hear the sound of the tires, but that’s all.\n\nAt this juncture it must be said that Lexus ac complishes the same sensation in its LS400 for about$40,000 less.\n\nHowever, the S500 has a feeling of granite-like solidity that no car I’ve ever driven can match. It’s as if the S500 is carved from single block of steel. Indeed, Mercedes-Benz builds the stiffest car bodies in the industry.\n\nA stiff body prevents the car from flexing as it encounters rough roads. It also makes the car safer by enabling it to absorb more energy in a crash. Another benefit of a rigid body is that it allows the suspension system to be very finely tuned.\n\nHowever, the great weight of the S500 may be too much for the suspension system. The S500 has four-wheel independent suspension, but the ride is anything but sporty. The car is so heavy that it almost feels unwieldy. Yes, it’ll turn a corner quickly and without leaning, but I never felt comfortable driving this car quickly, as I would a sports sedan.\n\nThe steering, which uses an outdated recirculating ball system instead of the more modern and efficient rack-and-pinion type, is heavy and somewhat dull. When you round a corner, the wheel is very slow to return to center.\n\nFor such a large car, the S500’s 41-foot turning radius is impressive. Not many cars this size could turn such a tight circle. The four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are industrial strength, but they have to be because of the car’s weight.\n\nA traction control system is standard.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nI don’t understand how seats that are so hard and firm could be so comfortable. But they are. The S500’s electrically adjustable front bucket seats are amazingly stiff. They don’t give much when you sit on them, and initially you feel a bit uncomfortable because you are not used to such rigid seats. Yet on two occasions I spent two hours behind the wheel and felt no fatigue at all. The seats offer support in all the right places.\n\nAs one might expect for this car’s high sticker price, the S500 is loaded with high-tech features.\n\nOne such item is the built-in, hands-free cellular phone. Once it is programmed, it will dial automatically when you call out numbers or give it verbal commands, such as ”call home” or ”call office.”\n\nSimplicity in a complex object also can be considered a luxury. Yet the dual zone air-conditioning system in the S500 has more than 20 buttons and switches. Thank goodness it has an automatic setting.\n\nCounting the clock, there are seven instruments in the gauge package. That’s a bit much. Particularly useless is a fuel economy gauge (anyone who spends $100,000 on a car likely could care less how much fuel costs).\n\nAlso, the gauges are fairly plain. One passenger who owned a ’70s era Mercedes said the gauges hadn’t changed much. For such an expensive car, a classy set of instruments would do much to add a bit of ambiance to the inside.\n\nSome of the car’s best features include plenty of room for rear passengers; a six-disc CD player; a massive trunk; afull menu of power accessories; thick, beautiful carpeting, and leather seat covers.\n\nPerhaps I would feel better about the S500 if it were more agile, weighed less and was tuned for American roads. But virtually no one I chauffeured in the S500 felt it was worth about $100,000, and I would have to agree.\n\nTruett’s tip: The S500, the biggest Mercedes-Benz sedan, is a heavy-duty luxury cruiser. It is exceptionally smooth and quiet, but a bit ponderous to drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class is the flagship passenger car of the Mercedes-Benz fleet and serves as a luxury and technological showcase for the brand. It comes in sedan, coupe and convertible body styles with a wide range of twin-turbocharged engines and rear- or all-wheel drive. S 450 models use a 362-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6; the S 560 uses a 463-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8; and the Maybach S 650 has a 621-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12. The performance-oriented AMG S 63 has a variant of the 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 603 hp, while the AMG S 65 has a 621-hp V-12 like the S 650. The S 450, S 560 and AMG S 63 all come with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the Maybach S 650 and AMG S 65 use a seven-speed automatic. The S-Class competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS and Maserati Quattroporte. Maybach versions, meanwhile, are ultraluxury models aimed at Bentley and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nA new plug-in hybrid S-Class sedan, the S 560e, is slated to arrive in mid-2019. It has an onboard 7.2-kilowatt charger for faster charging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Are Most Important?\n\nAs Mercedes' technological showcase, the S-Class offers several advanced driver assistance and semi-autonomous driving features. Among them are adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, steering assist, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring and a 360-degree camera system. The systems can help steer the car and change lanes (when the turn signal is activated), slow the car when heading into turns and provide automatic braking, among other tasks. An Energizing Comfort feature works with the climate control, in-cabin fragrance system, audio system and available massaging front seats to coddle occupants through muscle relaxation and other physical and ambient features designed to make them feel better. Available Magic Body Control uses cameras to detect the road ahead and adjust the suspension in milliseconds to maintain a smooth ride.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class historically has represented the best Mercedes has to offer in luxury, convenience, technology and safety, so this is the place to go for the brand's latest and greatest. There is plenty to like in the S-Class line, but there is so much to digest that a three-year lease might expire before you've mastered it all.",

      "expert_review": "To some folks, putting a diesel engine into the latest generation of the iconic Mercedes-Benz S-Class is akin to having cell phones ringing at a funeral.\n\nTo others — and the Mercedes folks feel that will be between 5 and 10 percent of S-Class buyers — the reaction is, “It’s about time to have a diesel option.”\n\nThe present generation S-Class flagship of the M-B lineup has been around since 2006, an extraordinarily long life in “automotive years.” However, it’s still the segment leader and many would argue it reigns as the finest automobile made.\n\nThe diesel engine, introduced by Rudolf Diesel in 1893, first went into volume production with Mercedes in 1936 with the 260D as a 2.5-liter engine with 45 horsepower. (We can’t give you a 0-to-60 time because its top speed was 59 miles per hour). In 1977, Mercedes came out with the 300SD, the first production turbo diesel. That vehicle was notable for two things:\n\n    It was, in automotive terms, nearly indestructible given minimal maintenance.\n\n    It demonstrated all the negatives many people still associate with diesels. It clattered, belched blue smoke, deposited a       sooty coating on the back of the car, and left a dirty exhaust smell in its wake.\n\nDue to more stringent US tailpipe regulations versus those in Europe, Mercedes then phased out the diesel after the 350SD in 1995.\n\nBut now it’s back. Passersby near the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Boylston Street were ogling a line of S-Class sedans parked in the valet area one late October afternoon. They didn’t look any different from the most common S-Class sedan — the S550 4Matic (all-wheel-drive) — other than the S350 badging.\n\nHowever, there’s a big difference under the hood. The S350 BlueTEC is powered by a 3.0-liter V-6 turbodiesel that produces a modest (for that size car) 240 horsepower but a whopping 455 lb.-ft. of torque — the amount of twisting force available to turn the wheels.\n\nThe BlueTEC diesel exhaust system uses an oxidizing catalytic converter and particulate filter before breaking gases down into nitrogen and water vapors by injecting Adblue, a urea solution, into the tailpipe. The Adblue is stored in a seven-gallon tank accessed under the spare tire and needs refilling at approximately 10,000-mile intervals. Mercedes emphasizes that both the diesel and new S400 Hybrid variants contain the same interior room, luxury and convenience accoutrements as all S-Class vehicles.\n\nBoston.com’s Cliff Atiyeh joined me for a drive around an in-town loop—one that covered a similar course as the annual Tufts 10K Columbus Day women’s road race. I headed for a blue sedan with camel interior, but Cliff motioned to a silver one instead. A good choice. It had a stunning deep cocoa and black leather interior package that was the equal of any interior I’ve ever seen, especially with the white-on-black electro luminescent S-Class gauges.\n\nYou had to be listening closely — with the $6,400 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound audio system turned off — to hear just the hint of engine clatter on a few occasions when the engine lugged slightly. We saw no smoke in the mirrors or from the other test S-Class diesel sedans on the road, though we did notice mild turbo lag when jumping hard on the throttle.\n\nPower goes to all four wheels through an advanced seven-speed automatic transmission that’s designed to work with a low-viscosity, low-friction transmission fluid (colored blue instead of red).\n\nMercedes’ Eric Linder, assistant product manager for the S-Class, said the diesel should return 21 miles per gallon in city driving, 31 on the highway, and 25 combined. And this M-B diesel does have a 0-to-60 time: About 7 seconds.\n\nIf there’s a downside, it’s that you’ll need a long sit-down lesson with your salesman in order to figure out all the controls. Linder feels there’s a knowledgeable customer base with experience in prior M-B diesels, a group that’s been waiting for a car such as this.\n\nPricing on the S350 starts at $92,550, $4,950 below the price of the best-selling S550 4Matic. And a diesel, with care, should run just a few miles short of forever.\n\nBill Griffith can be reached at WGriffith@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class is the flagship passenger car of the Mercedes-Benz fleet and serves as a luxury and technological showcase for the brand. It seats up to five and comes in sedan, coupe and convertible body styles with a wide range of twin-turbocharged engines and rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nS450 models use a 362-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6; the S560 and Maybach S560 use a 463-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8; and the Maybach S650 has a 621-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12. The performance-oriented AMG S63 has a variant of the 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 603 hp, while the AMG S65 has a 621-hp V-12 like the S650. The S450, S560 and AMG S63 all come with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the Maybach S650 and AMG S65 use a seven-speed automatic. A plug-in hybrid S560e is also offered.\n\nThe S-Class competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Lexus LS. Maybach versions, meanwhile, are ultraluxury models aimed at Bentley and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nKeyless access and push-button start are now standard, and a new AMG S65 Final Edition is available. Limited to 130 copies, the AMG S65 Final Edition features Obsidian Black Metallic paint, 20-inch matte-bronze wheels, gloss-black tailpipes, black Nappa leather with copper-colored contrast stitching, carbon-fiber trim with copper accents and special badging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Are Most Important?\n\nAs Mercedes’ technological showcase, the S-Class offers several advanced driver assistance and semi-autonomous driving features. Among them are adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, steering assist, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring and a 360-degree camera system. The systems can help steer the car and change lanes (when the turn signal is activated), slow the car when heading into turns and provide automatic braking, among other tasks.\n\nAn Energizing Comfort feature works with the climate control, in-cabin fragrance system, audio system and available massaging front seats to coddle occupants through muscle relaxation and other sensory features. Available Magic Body Control uses cameras to detect the road ahead and adjusts the suspension in milliseconds to maintain a smooth ride.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class historically has represented the best Mercedes has to offer in luxury, convenience, technology and safety, so this is the place to go for the brand’s latest and greatest. There is plenty to like in the S-Class line, but there is so much to digest that a three-year lease might expire before you’ve mastered it all.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA totally redesigned top-end S-Class sedan was unveiled in September 2005. It will go on sale as a 2007 model.\n\nMeanwhile, the current S-Class sedan continues into 2006 with several revisions. Foremost is a new S65 AMG edition with a 604-horsepower V-12 engine. Billed as the world’s fastest four-door, it’s said to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. Mercedes-Benz has also added a lower-priced model: an S350 sedan with a 3.7-liter V-6 engine.\n\nFor 2006, an AMG Sport Package and 4Matic all-wheel drive are no-cost options for S430 and S500 rear-wheel-drive models. The full-time all-wheel-drive system has a front-to-rear 40/60 torque split, but torque distribution to individual wheels varies under slippery conditions.\n\nKeyless Go, a heated steering wheel, an electronic trunk closer and rear side blinds are now standard on the S600 sedan. Mercedes-Benz’s available Pre-Safe system can recognize an impending impact before it occurs so it can adjust the seats to the safest position and activate the seat belt pretensioners.\n\nExterior\nMercedes-Benz describes the S-Class as a sedan with a coupelike profile that’s highlighted by a low nose and taller tail. A laid-back grille and smooth underbody improve airflow, which keeps the sedan’s coefficient of drag at a mere 0.27.\n\nThe S55 AMG features a sport suspension, racy aerodynamic body trim and 18-inch tires on Monoblock alloy wheels. The S600, S55 AMG and new S65 AMG all have Active Body Control that continuously adjusts suspension firmness to eliminate body roll during cornering, acceleration and braking.\n\nInterior\nFitted with a three-place rear bench, the S-Class seats up to five occupants. A split rear bench with power adjustments is optional. The front seats have 14-way power adjustments. Full leather upholstery, a navigation system and a Bose audio system are standard. Befitting its price, the S600 gets four heated power seats and a higher level of wood and leather trim. Adaptive cruise control is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFor 2006, Mercedes-Benz offers five engines. The S430 holds a 275-hp, 4.3-liter V-8, and the S500 gets a 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. The high-performance S55 AMG uses a 493-hp, supercharged 5.5-liter V-8. The S600 sedan carries a turbocharged 5.5-liter V-12 that delivers 493 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque. A 604-hp V-12 that delivers 738 pounds-feet of torque goes into the new S65 AMG, while the S350 sedan gets a 241-hp, 3.7-liter V-6.\n\nA seven-speed-automatic transmission goes into rear-wheel-drive S430 and S500 sedans, while the S55 AMG, S600, and 4Matic-equipped S430 and S500 sedans use a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are installed in each door. Side curtain-type airbags deploy from the roofline to protect occupants’ heads. An Electronic Stability Program combines traction control with lateral skid-control technology.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLoaded with technology, the S-Class is a smooth and supremely capable cruiser that may initially be marred by a slight sense of detachment; but that sensation soon eases. Despite its bounty of alluring attributes, the steering seems just a little too light.\n\nEven in the S500, performance is near stunning and automatic-transmission response qualifies as masterful. Although the ride is smooth, the S500 hits a few bumps rather hard. In fast curves, this big sedan stays remarkably upright.",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Mercedes-Benz S550 coupe is an opulent car that backs up its six-figure price with its blend of performance, comfort and stunning looks.\n\nJust paying a lot for something doesn’t necessarily mean your money will be well-spent. Other times, though, spending a lot of money can get you a markedly better experience than you would otherwise get. This Mercedes-Benz S-Class is just that.\n\nSo it is with Mercedes’ newest luxury coupe.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Mercedes-Benz S550 4Matic coupe that, with options and its $925 delivery charge, cost $135,375. The S550 coupe competes with other luxury coupes body-types such as the Bentley Continental GT and the BMW 6 Series. Compare them here. The S550 Coupe was introduced for the 2015 model year.\nExterior & Styling\nWhile Mercedes calls the car a coupe version of the S-Class, it shares no sheet metal with the big Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan. It’s better to think of the S550 coupe as the successor to the CL-Class luxury coupe that Mercedes sold as recently as the 2014 model year.\n\n \nWhatever you consider it, the S550 coupe is a stunner. It’s wide, low and long with an upright grille that calls to mind older Mercedes-Benz coupes, particularly the classic 300SL (you know, the one with gull-wing doors). It’s a good look, both because it looks good and because it calls to mind the brand’s heritage.\n \nThe pillarless side window design is also a plus. Unlike a sedan, there’s no structure between the A-pillars that flank the windshield and the pillars on either side of the rear window, and this really gives a graceful look to the coupe’s profile.\n\nOverall, the S550 coupe reminds you just how good-looking a coupe can be — and how gawky looking some four-door sedans with coupe trim and styling can be.  \nHow It Drives\nThe S550 shines at covering vast distances in comfort at highway (or faster) speeds.  A lot of this comfort comes down to the car’s standard auto Airmatic air suspension. That suspension is also offered as an option on other Mercedes-Benz models and features Comfort and Sport settings.\n\nI’ve tested many Mercedes models with the air suspension, and in general I find it to work very well. On the S550 coupe, it absorbs every bump while still letting the car feel planted. It’s not just that the ride is smooth, it’s that you can be taking a turn at 45 mph and hit a bump and the car just makes a sound and keeps tracking through the turn. There’s just such a turn on my drive home and, in other cars, it’s always an adventure. In the S550, it’s a non-event. This is true whether the suspension is set in Comfort or Sport.\n\nIn addition to the suspension, the engine and auto transmission can be adjusted to either Efficient or Sport. In Efficient, the car starts from a standstill in 2nd gear and shifts into upper gears quickly to save fuel. In Sport, the car starts in 1st and holds onto gears longer. Both work as advertised, and you do notice a difference between the two settings, though the engine will respond quickly if need be while the car is set to Efficient.\n \nSporty driving, though, is not the S550 coupe’s forte. Specifically, quick, darting changes on twisty roads are not what it’s best at, even with the suspension and engine set to Sport.\n\nFor buyers who want to scream through corners and have money to spend on an expensive coupe, there’s also the 2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT. You can read our initial impressions of that AMG car here. I think the presence of that road-scorching Mercedes-AMG beast in the lineup helps the S550 coupe, because now it doesn’t have to be all things to all people. Instead of trying to be both AMG-sporty and Mercedes-Maybach comfy, the S-class S550 coupe can serve as the comfortable, heavy grand tourer.\n\nSpeaking of weight, another editor pointed out that the S550 coupe weighs roughly as much as a Ford F-150 we tested at the same time, which gives you an idea of how heavy this big coupe is. However, it’s also worth noting that the S550 coupe, with its twin-turbo 4.7L V-8, has both more horsepower (449 vs. 385) and – more importantly – more torque (516 pounds-feet vs. 375) than the brutish pickup truck. So the Mercedes is heavy, but it’s also got the twin-turbocharged muscle to move its mass.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class S 550 coupe is EPA-estimated to get 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined. Premium gasoline is required.\n\nBut for all the power and big numbers, driving the S550 is more about spending hours behind the wheel and not feeling stressed or tired. Mercedes-Benz S-class specs don’t do it justice, because this is the area in which the S550 really excels.\n\n\nIn addition to the suspension, another — often overlooked — reason for this is that the S550 coupe does an excellent job of eliminating outside noises. As one reviewer put it, “I wish I could invite the S550 engineers over to my house for some home improvements.”\n\nMercedes does allow some engine noise to come into the cabin when the car is pushed, and it’s a good, snarling sound with a nice, muscular note when the car shifts gears. It’s especially gratifying when you learn the sound is all natural, as opposed to the fake, stereo-augmented sounds that are becoming more common in the market.\nThe Inside\nIf you’re claustrophobic, this is the car to help set your mind at ease. The S550 coupe is the brightest, most open-feeling car I’ve ever been in, short of a convertible. That’s partly because the S550 coupe has a large moonroof that extends well toward the rear of the car. The more I drove it, though, the more I realized the open feeling was down to the coupe’s “pillarless” design.\n\nWhere other cars have a structure (a B-pillar) between the windshield and rear-roof pillars, the S550 coupe has just a thin strip of weatherproofing where the front and rear side windows meet. It’s amazing how much this opens up the interior and gives you a truly panoramic view. Taken with that massive moonroof, I often felt like I was gliding along in a glass-canopied car of the future.\n\nYet all is not excellent when it comes to visibility: The A-pillars block views of pedestrians badly. This is due more to the angle of the pillars than to their width, but on more than one occasion I found myself having to work to peer around the pillar to be absolutely certain nobody was there.\n \nAside from that, the S550 coupe inspires confidence. Within a few moments, I felt I knew exactly where the front, sides and rear of the car were. I was ready to make the tight squeezes and sharp turns that are the norm in downtown Chicago, where we’re based. That’s a significant benefit when you’re driving a coupe that’s longer and almost as wide as a midsize Mercedes-Benz ML350 SUV.\n\nIn terms of quality, the S550’s interior is quite good. Our test model came with an optional designo leather seats package that suited the car, even though its white color wouldn’t be my preference. It’s worth noting that the package costs an extra $3,250, but even if money were no object I think I’d still be tempted to see what the standard interior covering looked like.\n\nBeyond that, there was real wood trim that managed to look good because the graining was subtle, and the glossy finish suited a luxury car. Too often, there are too many knots and grains in the wood, almost as if the automaker feels compelled to shout, “Yes, this is real wood!” Far better to have the material look good and actually feel like wood in my book, and that’s what Mercedes has done.\n\nThe S550 is a comfortable car to sit in up front. There’s plenty of room, and I was able to find a suitable driving position quite quickly. That’s not always the case for me in coupes. Our test model also had power seats that offered massage and active bolstering – meaning that when you turn into a corner, air bladders in the seat inflate to hold you in position.\n\nI tried both systems and found the active bolstering to be an odd, unsettling sensation, so I switched it off. The massage function – and the range of massages it offers – I used extensively in my test. They were definitely effective. They turned the last 15 minutes of a grinding, stop-and-go, three-hour drive into a pleasurable, de-stressing experience.\n \nWhile I might not spend the money on the designo leather, I could easily see spending the $3,500 you’ll have to pay to add the package with the massaging seats.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the S550 has rear seats and, in a pinch, we hauled an adult back there — but not without the front-seat passenger giving up a significant amount of space. It’s really a car for two people.\n\nOther editors and I noticed that when we had the seat positioned properly for our driving, the top of the steering wheel blocked the top of the gauge cluster, making it impossible to read the speedometer at highway speeds. Fortunately, the S550 had a head-up display (included in the $3,500 option package with the massaging seats), but without spending that extra money the gauges would be hard to read. That, also, could have been done better.\n\nNotable interior options on our test model included the designo leather package ($3,250), plus a heated steering wheel, heated center armrest and heated front and rear seats ($1,990).\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMost of what Mercedes stuffs into the S550 coupe here is quite good. The sole exception is the Comand system’s touch-sensitive controller, which is very sensitive and located in just such a place that it often responds to your touch when you don’t want it to. It has its useful features – notably the way it allows you to pull up your music source no matter what screen you’re on – but overall I found the touch-sensitive area frustrating.\n\nLikewise, the Comand system used to have sections along the bottom and top of the screen that allowed you to easily switch between, say, navigation and music. That’s now gone, and you must first nudge the rotary controller to make those sections show up, which means you also stand a good chance of hitting the touch-sensitive portion when you don’t mean to. I think this could be better.\n\nPart of what makes this so frustrating is that, once you’re in the menu you want to be in, the Comand system works quickly and is intuitive. Changing everything from the interior ambient lighting to the seat’s support settings is quite easy; it’s just that you may need a healthy amount of patience to get to the menu you need.\n \nFortunately, Mercedes offers buttons in the center console that allow you to shortcut to some settings, including the seats, navigation, vehicle settings and so forth. This was very well-done.\n\nOverall, Comand is like any other automakers’ multimedia/control screen in that it has its quirks. I don’t rank it at the head of the class, but I find it superior to the systems from Lexus and Cadillac.\nCargo & Storage\nThe S550 coupe offers a large trunk that would be suitable for two people — even heavy-packing people — to take a long vacation.\n\nInside the cabin, again, the S550 coupe offers enough storage for two people, as the center console is large for a vehicle in this class.\nSafety\nAs is often the case with low-volume luxury cars, the Mercedes-Benz S550 coupe has not been crash-tested by our preferred organization, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Further, while the S-Class sedan has been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the coupe we drove has not been.\n\nThere was a large complement of safety options on our test model, most grouped under Mercedes’ $2,800 Driver Assistance Package. That package includes adaptive cruise control — branded Distronic Plus with Steering Assist — which can help keep the car centered in its lane on straight roads, maintain a set distance between the S550 and a car ahead, and bring the car to a complete stop. It also includes a blind spot monitoring system that can guide the car back into your lane if you attempt to merge into an occupied lane; a lane-keeping system that vibrates the steering wheel and can use the brakes to “steer” the car back into your lane if you stray; braking that scans the road ahead and can recognize pedestrians and apply the brakes at speeds less than 35 mph (branded Pre-Safe Brake with Pedestrian Recognition); and a system that scans the road and alerts drivers if it senses an impending collision at speeds of 45 mph or less (that one’s called BAS Plus with Cross-Traffic Assist).\n\nThe lane warning and lane-keeping systems kicked in a few times during my test. When the S550 coupe warns that you’re straying from your lane, there’s a slight vibration through the steering wheel, as if you’re running over the reflectors that often line roads. If you don’t correct your course and the active system kicks in; the vibrations become more severe and you feel the car tug itself back into the lane. It’s obtrusive – you’ll notice it – but because this is a safety system alerting you to something you’re doing wrong, I don’t mind that. Bear in mind, though, the system works only on straight roads; I found it wouldn’t kick in when there was even the slightest bend in the road.\n \nIn addition to those safety features, we also had the aforementioned $3,500 Premium Package that included the massaging seats, head-up display and a surround-view camera that provided numerous views – including a 360-degree overhead view – when parking. I found the cameras fun to use when pulling into the many tight spaces that make up Chicago. But as I said, I found visibility in the car to be good. I didn’t need to rely on the cameras, but they were nice to have as backup. Our S-class tester also had Mercedes’ Night View Assist Plus that cost $2,260, though I was unable to test that system.\n\nBrowse the S550’s entire list of safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nWhen you consider the $135,375 price of our S550 coupe test model, “value” with this car clearly means value relative to the class. It’s not a synonym for low price, because the Mercedes-Benz S-class ain’t cheap.\n\n\nStill, I really believe it lives up to the price it commands. Not only did I think it was very good-looking, it turned heads during my test drive, and that’s unusual for any car we test. Its ride over Chicago’s horrid roads was, simply, unbelievably good. And its ability to cover hundreds of miles in silence, while offering a panoramic view of the world as it whips by, is unparalleled. Another reviewer summed it up this way: “[It] feels more like driving a boutique luxury automaker’s one-off concept car than something you can get serviced around the corner at a local Mercedes dealership.” I don’t disagree.\n\nMy quibble is that I really would want to spend the full $135,000 for the loaded version I drove, rather than opt for the “base” model at $120,825.\n \nWe can only test what they give us, but I can’t help thinking that our inability to see the tops of the gauges would be much more annoying without the optional head-up display. And wouldn’t that three-hour grind have been much more stressful without the optional massaging seats? Getting those features means spending thousands of dollars more to get the ultimate experience the S550 coupe can offer.\n \nWhen all is said and done, though, if you can afford the cost and options you’ll get a beautiful, impressive ride that belongs in the highest class of luxury cars.\n\nSend Bill an email",
