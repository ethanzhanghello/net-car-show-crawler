      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class delivers the power and luxury you expect from a vehicle sporting the three-pointed star emblem. This mid-size SUV seats five in its standard form or seven with its available third row. It’s available with a wide variety of powertrains and options. The base GLE350 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and it can be had with rear- or all-wheel drive. All other GLEs come solely with AWD. A 375-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, while a 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. All three powertrains are equipped with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The GLE450e plug-in hybrid pairs a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a 23.3-kilowatt-hour battery, which combine for a total of 381 hp and an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 50 miles.\n\nFor high-performance buyers, Mercedes offers two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and the 603-hp AMG GLE63S. Both are available as a traditional SUV or in a sloped-roof coupe body style; the latter features a fastback-style tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design. For 2025, the GLE450 is available in the coupe body style, too.\n\nWith so many permutations, the GLE-Class’ competition is varied. Its rivals include the likes of the BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Audi Q8, Volvo XC90 and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe GLE lineup expands for 2025 with the addition of a RWD GLE350 version and a coupe version of the GLE450. A biometric fingerprint scanner is now standard equipment, and new paint and upholstery colors have been added.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHeated front seats\nPower liftgate\nSurround-view parking camera\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nForward collision warning with automatic braking\nBlind spot warning\nDriver-monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad-sign recognition\nMBUX voice recognition\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options, but even in its base format, it’s elegantly appointed — and the 255-hp turbo-four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. Venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, of course: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual to learn.",
