      "expert_review": "What a car. Makes you forget the German automaker ever foisted on the public the 190 series sedan-a tiny, cramped, underpowered, rough-riding imitation of a luxury sedan that remained virtually unchanged for 10 years but felt like a century.\n\nA fashion may come back in style if you wait long enough, but with cars you get one chance to make the most of it. The 190 wore out its welcome about as quickly as the leisure suit. Unfortunately, it stayed around for nine more years-the 190, not the leisure suit.\n\nBut all is forgiven now that the C-Class sedan has graced the 1994 model year.\n\nThe C-Class is offered in two versions-the C280 and the C220. The difference as hinted at by the names is that the C280 is powered by a 2.8-liter, 194-horsepower, 24-valve, in-line 6-cylinder engine and the C220 by a 2.2-liter, 148-h.p., 16-valve, 4-cylinder.\n\nThat’s it. Same body, different soul. Identical twins that you can tell apart by the “280” on one deck lid, and “220” on the other. Step on the accelerator and you’ll know in an instant which one you are nestled in.\n\nWe tested the 1994 C220 sedan and found it offers all the goodies of the 280, the car we chose as import of the year in last year’s “North American Car of the Year” competition judged by the automotive media.\n\nThe C220 sports styling is very similar to the larger and $13,000 more expensive E-Class sedan. With the new sheet metal came an inch longer wheelbase that feels like a foot in improved ride and handling and two inches more length, two inches more height and one inch more width, all of which feels more like yards in terms of spaciousness.\n\nThe suspension holds you in place without jostling, a considerable feat considering the leather seats are rather stiff-too much so, in fact.\n\nDual air bags are standard, as are anti-lock brakes. Traction control is available, though it’s part of a $1,605 package that includes headlamp washers and heated seats. That’s unfortunate because heated seats implies that traction control is needed only in Snow Belt climates to ensure you move from the light without slipping and keep from skidding in turns and corners packed with the white stuff. Traction control does the same when motorists overdrive their cars on rain-soaked roads or ones partially covered by loose gravel.\n\nAs we said, same body, different soul. Step on the pedal and the message is clear that the 220 is 46 horses shy of pulling the same load as quickly as the 280.\n\nWhereas the C280 is aimed at luxury sedan buyers concerned with stepping away from the light, merging into traffic and pulling out to pass to avoid congestion, the C220 is designed for the luxury sedan buyer concerned with enjoying the finery while others scoot from the light, down the ramp or into the passing lane ahead of it.\n\nThe 2.8-liter, 6 feels almost V-8 like. The 2.2 feels, well, like a 4-cyl inder. The fuel economy rating is 22 miles per gallon city/28 m.p.g. highway or 2 m.p.g. better in city and highway driving than with the 2.8. The 220 is a luxury car that provides excellent mileage for those who can afford to stop at the pump but want to arrive at the weekend retreat on a single tank.\n\nOf course, you could stop at the parts counter of your favorite Mercedes dealership and pick up an “8” to substitute for a “2” on the deck lid to make others think you have the more powerful 280 version. That’s a California trick, by the way. They do the same with SL roadster models, buying a “cheapo” SL320 for $78,300 and then purchasing a “50” or “60” to convert the SL320 into an $89,900 SL500 or a $120,100 SL600.\n\nThough the C280 is outselling the C220 nationally by about 2 to 1, Bill Knauz, a Lake Forest Mercedes-Benz dealer, said consumers here aren’t using the number-switching ruse because the C220 is in good demand.\n\n“There are a lot o people to whom the difference in performance between the 220 and 280 doesn’t mean all that much,” said Knauz, who pointed out that the C220 attraction is a $29,900 base price versus $34,000 plus change for the 280 and roughly $5,000 to $6,000 more than that for a Japanese luxury car.\n\nStandard equipment includes power brakes and steering, 4-speed automatic transmission, cruise control, power locks, power windows with express down, power sunroof, power driver’s seat, automatic climate control, AM/FM radio with cassette, cellular phone/compact disc player wiring; and leather-wrapped steering wheel/gearshift lever. Our test car added metallic paint for $565, split folding rear seats with ski pass through for $320 and power front passenger seat for $560. Add $475 for freight.\n\nA few features worth mentioning are the split-second rear window defroster, cassette holders in the lower dash, built-in knee bolster in the lower dash to keep you from submarining in a frontal impact though the suspension has built in anti-dive geometry, which keeps the car level in a panic stop, and shoulder belt height adjusters in the door pillars.\n\nWhen Mercedes softens the leather seats, we hope it also will enlarge the minuscule glove box under the passenger-side air bag and go back to dual windshield wipers instead of the single Freddie Krueger-like claw it now employs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a five-seat compact luxury sedan that competes against the likes of the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70 and Volvo S60. Working in favor of the C-Class is its strong and efficient 255-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a nine-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive is optional. \n\nYou can also upgrade to one of two available AMG-tuned models, both of which have hotter engines and lots of high-performance hardware. The AMG C43 has a 402-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, while the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the AMG C63 doles out a staggering 671 hp. AWD is standard on AMG models.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nNewly standard on the C-Class are front and rear parking sensors, a wireless charging pad and satellite radio. Mercedes has dropped the coupe and convertible body styles from the C-Class lineup; they’ve been replaced by the new-for-2024 CLE-Class coupe and convertible. On the AMG side, the redesigned C63 debuts as a sedan only, and the C43 sees minor changes in its standard and available equipment after a redesigned sedan-only version debuted last year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nHeated front seats\nThree USB ports\nPanoramic moonroof\nAmbient interior lighting\nDual-zone climate control\nRain-sensing wipers\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nBlind spot warning\nSafe exit assist\nDriver-monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nNavigation\nBurmester audio system\nHead-up instrument display\nAdaptive cruise control\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nSurround-view parking camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class pushes a lot of the right buttons in terms of driving manners and interior refinement. It looks and feels like a luxury-branded small sedan should, but many rivals deliver a more cohesive package. We found a number of the C-Class’ tech features to be overly complicated, and competing models — such as the BMW 3 Series and Genesis G70 — are simply more enjoyable to drive. Limited rear legroom and a stiff ride when equipped with its available sport suspension don’t help matters.",

      "expert_review": "Just a few model years out from an overhaul that saw its AMG performance variants undergo a tectonic shift, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is little changed for 2025. The luxury sedan’s infotainment system is upgraded to Mercedes’ latest, third-generation MBUX technology, and there’s a new center airbag between the front seats to help reduce injuries from occupants banging into each other.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nFor the performance versions, AMG powertrain engineers found another 14 horsepower in the C43’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, bringing output to 416 hp. And while composite brakes are already standard on the AMG C-Classes, upgraded ceramic-composite rotors with gold calipers are now optional on the top-dog C63 S E Performance.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,150 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nC300: $49,600\nC300 4Matic: $51,600\nAMG C43: $63,650\nAMG C63 S E Performance: $87,200\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level C300 features 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a moonroof, power-operated trunk lid, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and keyless entry and start. Inside are power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging and 64-color ambient lighting. Standard cabin tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and an 11.9-inch touchscreen with voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Rear-wheel drive is standard. The C300 4Matic is identically equipped other than adding all-wheel drive and heated windshield-washer nozzles.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the AMG C43 gains an upgraded suspension with adaptive dampers, larger brakes with silver calipers and a 360-degree camera system in case you want to park yourself. The monster-output AMG C63 adds 19-inch wheels, composite brakes, a panoramic moonroof and a Burmester 3D surround-sound system.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe standard safety suite is relatively basic. Forward collision alert with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, front and rear parking sensors, a driver-attention monitor and automatic high beams are it — plus the incongruently high-tech automated parking.\n\nBut the Driver Assistance Package, available for a mere $1,950 on every trim level, adds oncoming and front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, automated lane changes, road-sign recognition that can adjust the vehicle’s speed to the current speed limit, and emergency steering assist.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 C-Class’ Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nUnder the hood of the entry-level C300 is a mild-hybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four making 255 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque. All C-Classes are fitted with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The C300 returns an EPA-rated 25/35/29 mpg city/highway/combined; the 4Matic manages 24/33/27 mpg.\n\nThe AMG C43 also has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four, but an electrically driven turbocharger that spools up faster helps it generate 416 hp and 369 pounds-feet; it comes with AWD. The EPA rates the C43 at 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nIn the AMG C63, a larger turbo and 201-hp electric motor on the rear axle vault total output to 671 hp and 752 pounds-feet. Turning that much grunt into forward momentum rather than smoke would be a lot to ask of just two tires, so it also has AWD. The C63 does, however, have a rear-drive Drift mode for buyers with a surplus in their rubber budget. The C63’s 6.1-kilowatt-hour battery pack is there more to add power than for electric travel, as the car is only capable of traveling about 3 miles before the engine fires up, per Mercedes.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance Review: My, What a Big Turbo You Have\n19 Vehicles Earn IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C300 Review: Losing Its Way\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After having redone its entry-level line for 1998, you’d think the folks at Mercedes Benz would leave well enough alone for their most affordable sedan, the C230.\n\nBut with increasing competition in the near-luxury class — those cars with base prices from $30,000 to $40,000 — the folks at M-B addressed one of the C230s biggest deficits: power.\n\nWhen it debuted last year, the underpowered C230 came with a mere 148 horsepower, less than a Nissan Altima.\n\nThankfully, this year the standard engine comes from Mercedes Benz’s SLK coupe. That translates into a 37 horsepower increase and 38 pound-feet of torque increase. The numbers: 185 horsepower and 200 pound-feet of torque from a 2.3-liter in-line four-cylinder engine. You’d expect double-overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, but it’s the Eaton supercharger with an intercooler that adds the oomph. Zero to 60 now takes a mere 8.1 seconds, two seconds quicker than last year and closer to other cars in this class. That’s only 0.1 second slower than the more expensive six-cylinder model.\n\nIt also makes this car a real alternative for someone looking for a car in the low 30s price range, something that couldn’t be said of its predescessor.\n\nThe engine initially seems every bit of four-cylinders, but the crankshaft-driven supercharger kicks in with a hearty whine and lots of power. While not the quietest engine ever encountered, it lends the car a sporty edge. Power is well-controlled, with full power available closer to highway speeds. Passing power is quite good. With the exception of the engine noise, you’ll forget you’re driving a four.\n\nPower is fed theough a five-speed automatic transmission that adopts its shifts to suit the driver’s driving style. Traction control is standard as is four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. Braking was excellent in all kinds of weather, with short straight stops. Although the electronic stability program isn’t offered, the car never fishtailed, even in wet weather. A good performance for a rear-drive automobile.\n\nThe recirculating ball, power-assisted steering was responsive and direct, steering the car exactly where it was pointed. The system has good weight to it.\n\nThe ride was firm, revealing the pitiful state of most roads in Pennsylvania. The ride never became punishing, but this vehicle is not for those who like a soft ride. The upside is cornering was great — the car handled the twisties as if it was riding on rails. Road noise was a little high as was tire noise on concrete surfaces.\n\nAlthough the test vehicle wasn’t equipped with it, enthusiasts will want their C230 with the optional $890 Sport Package. For that sum, your Mercedes will get larger 16-inch wheels, performance tires (205/55R16), leather front sport seats, an even firmer suspension and a telescoping steering wheel.\n\nOf course, safety is always a high priority with Mercedes, so you’d expect front and side, door-mounted air bags, not to mention ABS and tract ion control. But the C230 also has a BabySmart seat. The front passenger-side air bags are deactivated when a BabySmart-compatible seat is detected. The car also features Brake Assist, a system that detects an emergency braking situation and applies the brakes more quickly and with more force than the driver.\n\nNew standard equipment on the C230 includes leather seat inserts (full leather is an option) and a new audio system that integrates radio and cellular phone controls into one unit.\n\nThe front bucket seats are firm and comfortable, although after a couple hours in the saddle, you’ll find them a little too firm.\n\nThe driver’s side seat is eight-way power adjustable; the passenger-side adjusts manually. Finding a comfortable position behind the wheel was easy, despite the fact that the wheel didn’t adjust.\n\nRear seat room was sufficient for two passengers, three if they’re really friendly. The rear seatbacks are nicely reclined and headrests ensure passen ger safety.\n\nOther rear-seat amenities include an armrest with integrated cupholders and a first-aid kit.\n\nGauges were typical Mercedes — clear and easy to read. The headlights are activated with a simple twist knob. The stalks are also normal, with turn signals to the left, wipers to the right. A second, smaller left-hand stalk activates the cruise control. As in other Mercedes Benz models, it’s easy to hit the stalk accidentally.\n\nThe climate controls adjust manually. Two twist knobs control air-flow and fan speed. Temperature is adjusted by a thumb-wheel and is split for each side of the cabin. No indicator points to exactly where the temperature is activated. But the climate control worked quickly and effectively. The fan was quiet.\n\nMercedes Benz audio systems have never been my favorite, but this year’s seem to be a major improvement. The Bose system includes AM/FM/cassette with an optional trunk-mounted CD changer. The face of the system pops open to reveal the cassette deck. An integrated weather band keeps you appraised of changing conditions. Signal strength seems better, as does sound. The station preset buttons double as the keypad for an optional cell phone.\n\nIn typical German fashion, the cabin is well made without an ostentatious feeling. The burled walnut is handsome and helps warm the austere plastics.\n\nStorage space is good with two compartment armrests. A two-cup holder and a couple of small storage nooks can be found up front. The glove compartment is small, too small to hold the owner’s manual.\n\nThe 12.9 cubic foot trunk seems bigger than its rating, with a useful shape and low liftover.\n\nSo this nifty little Mercedes seems to be a much better value than it was at its debut. The new supercharged engine brings it closer to its rivals in performance.\n\nIf you think you can’t afford it, guess again. This car starts at $31,200. The test car came with three options: special paint ($600), CD change ($750) and a sunroof ($1,100). Total with destination was $34,255. Most mid-sized cars don’t cost a whole lot less.\n\nFor the buyer who seeks prestige at an affordable price, few cars match the car beneath this three-pointed star.\n\n1999 Mercedes C230 Kompressor\n\nEngine: 2.3-liter DOHC 16-valve I-4 Transmission: 5-speed automatic Standard: P205/60-R15 tires, light alloy wheels, manual climate control with pollen filter, power drivers seat, remote locking, AM/ FM/WB/cassette radio, leather seat inserts, walnut trim, cupholders, power windows with auto up and down,vanity mirrors, cruise control, integrated garage door openers, floor mats, auto-dimming mirrors, front and side air-bags, traction control, anti-lock brakes, anti-theft alarm with engine disabler.

      "expert_review": "There is nothing quite like the magic of a name, and a name like Mercedes-Benz has that certain magic.\n\nPart of the magic of Mercedes is the image of quality and performance. Never one to be lacking in the latter of that duo, Mercedes is bringing on line a new supercar, the Mercedes C43.\n\nAs a new limited production V-8 powered version of Mercedes’ C-Class sedan, it’s represented by local dealer World Wide Motors and is a model not like any other C-Class.\n\nNot only is the C43 a super-swift set of wheels, but it enjoys the distinction of being modified by Germany’s top automotive performance company, AMG.\n\nAMG, whose name comes from founder Hans-Werner Aufrecht, his former partner Erhard Melcher, and the town of Gossapach, Germany, has been a collaborator with Mercedes since 1967.\n\nSo when MB decided to build a Autobahn-burner four-door based on its C-Class model, AMG was the natural choice to put the final touches on the sedan.\n\nThe “touches” add up to items like 302-horsepower out of 260 cubic inches (4.2-liters), a race car like handling, 0-60 miles per hour in 5.9 seconds, and a top speed that is electronically capped at 155 mph.\n\nIf you took off the electronic controls, who knows how fast this thing would go.\n\nAs is characteristic of a Mercedes-Benz automobile, the C43 combines the sound and the fury with luxury and exclusivity. In other words, this is no hair-shirt motor car.\n\nOwners can whistle down the Interstate amidst the trappings of leather, walnut woods, and a plethora of electronic genies that do everything for you but steer.\n\nThe C43 is based on Mercedes’ C-Class architecture, which dictates a wheelbase of 105.9 inches and overall length of 177.4 inches.\n\nThe engine, suspension, wheels and tires, instrumentation, and elements of the body work are specific to this particular model.\n\nThe motor is Mercedes’ new-generation V-8 that employs interesting three-valve and twin spark plug technology.\n\nIn C43 form, it is 10 percent more powerful than the standard version of the V-8 used in the full-sized Mercedes E430 luxury sedan.\n\nRather than adopting dual overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, the C43’s valve train utilizes a single overhead cam (per bank) that actuates two intakes and one exhaust valve.\n\nThe three-valve technology dramatically reduces emissions during the critical warmup stage by 40 percent. And Mercedes claims in general there is no trade-off in horsepower and torque.\n\nThe two spark plugs per cylinder, which is a design parameter that was a feature of Mercedes engines before Mercedes joined Benz, results in cleaner burning during the combustion process.\n\nTo handle the torque, which numerically is the same as the horsepower, 302 foot-pounds, Mercedes pulled the heavy duty five-speed automatic that is in its 6.0-liter V-12-powered models and dropped it into the C43.\n\nThis is one of the so-called “smart” transmissions that automatically adapts its shifting strategy to an individual’s driving style.\n\nA s a five-speed that thinks, once it learns that style it responds like a manual transmission in the hands of a skilled driver.\n\nMercedes automobiles have the comforting feeling of being as steady as a rock, even when rocketing along in triple digits.\n\nBut AMG takes this a step further with lessons learned from about 27 years of racing various MB products.\n\nUp front, AMG suspension geometry reduces front end dive during heavy braking. And when drivers gets on the binders in this sedan they really throw out the anchor.\n\nThe front disc brakes are an additional 2 inches in diameter over C-Class sedans, and almost a half-inch thicker.\n\nAt the rear, they are almost 1.5 inches bigger and over a half an inch thicker.\n\nAdd AMG specified Bilstein shocks, higher spring rates, heavy duty control arms, and super wide 17-inch wheels with wider tires at the front than the rear, and you have the r ecipe for sweeping through turns like there is no tomorrow.\n\nThe C43 retains the integrity of the basic C-Class chassis/body construction, it has been given a deeper front air dam, a lower rear apron, and door sill panels.\n\nSo check your mirrors, pull the shifter into Drive, step on the throttle, and hang on.\n\nIt’s not, however a drive without a price, as the suggested manufacturer’s retail price is listed as $52,750, plus freight and a limited number of options.\n\nBut it sure is motoring with panache.",

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz’s C36 is a carnival ride for adults.\n\nStomp the gas pedal and it pins you back in the seat like a roller coaster heading downhill. Crank the fat leather steering wheel into a corner and it’s hard to hold your head upright. It is so rewarding to drive that even the shortest trip is enjoyable.\n\nIn general, the C36 looks pretty much like a regular C-Class sedan, but closer inspection reveals a meaner stance, huge tires and discreet lower-body spoilers for improved high-speed stability.\n\nModified for Mercedes by AMG, a German aftermarket company known for stuffing monster motors into Mercedes-Benz sedans, the C36 is a limited-edition, high-performance sedan about the size of a Ford Contour. AMG has packed a hand-built, 3.6-liter engine under the hood, and when you unleash all 276 horsepower it romps to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds and has an electronically limited top track speed of 155 mph. It will humble many sports cars. Only about 200 of them will be imported in this, its final year, with a $51,925 price tag that reflects its exclusivity.\n\nBorn in a country where cruising at more than 125 miles per hour is common, its top speed capabilities are largely wasted in America, yet it is immensely enjoyable for those who love driving a car that responds like a thoroughbred. It gathers speed so deceptively that 80 mph feels like 60 mph, requiring extra vigilance if you want to avoid getting nabbed for speeding.\n\nWith a reworked suspension and ultra-low profile tires on 17-inch wheels it grips the road like a tick on a dog’s back. The taut ride occasionally gets bumpy over bad pavement, but at speed it is so firm you appreciate the security it provides.\n\nMost of the interior is understated Mercedes-Benz, but AMG added light gray accents to the small, thick steering wheel and around the instruments. Polished wood is used on the center console and across top of the dash.\n\nThe sport bucket seats, covered in perforated leather, are firm and deeply contoured. They gripped the sides of my torso as if they were custom-fitted just for me, yet never did they feel confining.\n\nSwitches for the power windows and rearview mirrors are located on the console alongside the gearshift. While I would prefer window switches on the doors, getting used to these is not too hard.\n\nA large leather knob sits atop the gearshift lever, which slides through a notched gate that enables you to manually select gears without taking your eyes from the road.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission is a delight to use because it learns your driving habits and shifts accordingly. If you drive slowly, it shifts so smoothly you can’t feel it. Drive hard and it holds each gear longer.\n\nThe transmission’s winter start mode lessens the chance of wheel slippage by starting off in a higher gear. For $1,875 you can add an advanced traction control system, heated seats and headlamp washers. This package is $275 less than it was last year.\n\nOther standard features include a programmable garage door opener built into the sunvisor, anti-lock brakes, dual airbags and a sensor that deactivates the passenger-side airbag if it detects less than 26 pounds in the seat.\n\nThe C36 is an immensely rewarding car for people who love high-performance cars with a rock-solid feel. Its discreet profile lets it slip through traffic like a minnow in a school of sharks.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $51,925. Options included a built-in, hands-free cellular phone, compact disc player, heated front seats, headlamp washers and ASR traction control.\n\nThe sticker price was $56,490.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The C36 is an expensive, exclusive high-performance tool that is as discreet as it is fast. It gobbles up the road, never f ls flustered and doesn’t show off to passersby. A perfect Stealth-mobile.\n\nCounterpoint: A car this good has little to criticize. It rides a bit harshly, and the back seat is rather small, but that’s it.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.6-liter, 6-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 105.9 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,550 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $51,925\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $56,490\n\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "In efforts to mop up every last buyer, manufacturers can’t seem to leave well enough alone.\n\nSo they build limited editions to poke the performance devil and stir the cowboy way lurking in a lot of us. These beefsteak brands cost bigger bucks, most sneer at automatic transmissions, some are inspired by European sedan racers, and all are an absolute hoot.\n\nBMW takes a perfectly satisfying 325i sedan, tightens the suspension, mounts high-speed tires on larger wheels, massages the engine for more horsepower, and whelps a 150 m.p.h. screamer called the M3.\n\nFord’s Special Vehicles Team makes similar magic with the venerable and flexible Mustang. The car’s 5.0-liter V-8 is inflated from 215 to 240 horsepower, an air dam and spoiler are added, suspension is lowered, and a reptilian badge in your rearview mirror may be the only warning that you are about to be smoked by a Mustang Cobra.\n\nVolvo is in the field with its 850 T-5R, where T stands for turbocharged and R means racing and the whole is a Scandinavian wolf in family sedan cladding.\n\nNow come Aufrecht, Melcher and Grossapach. Or AMG. Who do for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class what Richard Simmons does for patio potatoes by converting overweight, gentle snoozers into feisty, finely muscled pieces of work.\n\nAufrecht (engineer Hans-Werner) and Melcher (former partner Erhard) and Grossapach (the German town where Aufrecht was born) start with a bread-and-bratwurst Mercedes-Benz C280.\n\nIt’s a pleasant enough car for old parsons and new lawyers. But several wild dreams removed from the C280-based sedans AMG prepares for the European Touring Car Championship.\n\nMercedes-Benz in northern Germany initiates the C36 transmogrification by fitting a stock C280 with several factory improvements borrowed from heftier, more expensive lions in the line.\n\nA beefier differential is bolted aboard to handle the C36’s increased engine power. Larger disc brakes are installed to make sure that which goes faster also stops more securely. A more responsive steering box, shorter springs and industrial strength anti-sway bars are added for a stiffer, more positive ride.\n\nThe car also is mounted with 17-inch wheels and Bridgestone Expedia tires showing profiles low enough to appease those who cruise Compton in custom pickups.\n\nThen the work-in-progress is trucked from big city Bremen to rural Affalterbach, where AMG’s young Frankensteins begin removing and dismantling the engine, transmission and most of the interior.\n\nOne man, one engine is the standard as the C280’s 2.8-liter in-line six swells into the C36’s 3.6-liter power source. Cylinders are bored out and the piston stroke lengthened. Forged aluminum pistons are added.\n\nA new camshaft and crankshaft are installed. Cylinderhead exhaust ports are enlarged. Sterner commands are programmed into the Bosch engine-management computer to optimize benefits from the enl arged fuel-air intake and altered valve timing.\n\nAnd so a 194-horsepower engine good for fast touring through pretty scenery becomes a 268-horsepower street fighter built for ugly times wherever big dogs snarl.\n\nCosmetologists pick up the C280-to-C36 journey here, adding a deeper, under-bumper front air dam, side skirts and a new rear apron. Also twin rectangular chromed tailpipes and plainer, five-spoke wheels.\n\nAMG and C36 monograms, of course, are Liberace-liberal. On instruments and carpets. On wheels and rear deck. On gearshift knob and wheels. There’s also a light gray leather insert on the dark gray, leather-covered steering wheel to remind us this is indeed a kustomwagen.\n\n*\n\nAnd so a $36,000 C280 becomes a $50,000 C36.\n\nWith a question: A price differential of $14,000 is a pretty obvious difference, but is the C280/C36 performance margin as distinctive?\n\nWith an easy answer: Not only is the C36’s athleticism immediately notic able, the car adds a fresh dimension to this business of honing mid-city four-doors into hot rods.\n\nFor the pendulum of BMW’s M3, Ford’s Cobra and Volvo’s T-5R swings much closer to performance. Their bare knuckles show. Any display of good manners is strictly a pretense and there is no easy way to leash the beast. Attempt something dramatic and there is noise, heads swivel and frowns accuse you of being the politically incorrect marauder.\n\nBut the C36 has a dual personality and it is in perfect balance. Driven mildly it loses none of that integrated feel and solid footing so characteristic of Mercedes; the security of knowing you are safe inside something heavy designed to protect and coddle. Decide to explore the upper reaches of this car, stab the throttle, and driving becomes more a matter of hanging on and enjoying the exhilaration as the C36 growls and exerts its authority.\n\nYet even at pace, driven to its extremes, the car is far from unruly. Everything is achieved without ruffling nerves and poise of either car or driver. The C36 makes no noisy announcement that it is about to eat everything in sight, and doesn’t strut hard in search of praise when victory is done.\n\nThere’s even high purpose to owning a car that runs from zero to 60 m.p.h.in six seconds and cruises all day at 120 m.p.h. without stops for water.\n\nFor with those performance numbers comes great torque, the basic force of automotive propulsion. With such a surplus of power, a car easily runs ahead to where traffic has cleared. Or sprints past doofi who have yet to realize they have no right of way when wobbling at 45 m.p.h. onto a freeway full of 70 m.p.h. traffic.\n\nRefinement and elegance, of course, are usually the first casualties of enhanced performance. Whether the product be cars, ballplayers or rock stars.\n\nAnd exuberance typically smothers smoothness. But in the C36, polished engineering produces a versatility that allows the sophistication of Mercedes, and its heritage, to hold fast. Certainly the marque’s social image survives the transformation.\n\nOddly, on a car where everyone has worked so hard and systems perform so well, there is an oversight in the steering. Even in the fast-ratio steering box that is part of the conversion.\n\nIt is far too vague for a car of this ability. Point and go is the expected result of moving most steering wheels. Point, go, now correct back to the intended line, is more the practice in the C36.\n\nSmall flaws of the C280 also slop over to the C36. Shifting the automatic from park to anyplace remains a strange wriggle, much like tracing the back nine on a miniature golf course. The C36 will not be available with a manual transmission, an item usually last on the wish list of typical Mercedes owners.\n\nDespite a thinking gearbox that reads your right foot and shifts accordingly, the response to urgent calls remains a little hesitant. Even d ownshifting the automatic before a turn doesn’t seem to keep revs up. So the car is inclined to hesitate before finding the power to move smartly through and out of the corner.\n\nStill, the C36 is an ultra performer that clearly hasn’t compromised the quality and comforts of a Mercedes. Nor does it have the brooding, black look of something that will scare the buttons off your shorts.\n\nMercedes will build 1,000 C36s this year and ship 400 to the United States. Then it will discover how many enthusiasts are prepared to buy a high-performance car that costs $14,000 more than a BMW M3 and $25,000 more than a Mustang Cobra.\n\nOur guess is about 400.\n\n1995 Mercedes-Benz AMG C36\n\nCost Base and as tested: $49,800. (Includes leather upholstery; power sunroof; dual air bags; automatic transmission; automatic climate control; alarm; power windows, locks and seats; 17-inch alloy wheels; Bose sound system; anti-lock brakes, and traction cont ol.)\n\nEngine 3.6-liter, 24-valve, in-line six, developing 268 horsepower.\n\nType Front engine, rear-drive, high performance sedan.\n\nPerformance O-60 m.p.h., as tested, 6.2 seconds. Top speed, electronically limited, 155 m.p.h. EPA fuel consumption, city and highway, 18 and 22 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 3,549 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Can it be seven years since Mercedes-Benz introduced their C-Class, the baby of the family, to the U.S. market? That was a good, if not lust-inducing car, far superior to the “baby Benz” that preceded it. Let’s see what a billion-dollar (!) investment can do for an encore.\n\nThe 2001 model-year C-Class sedan is completely new, looking for all the world like the patriarch of the family, the S-Class, after it was left in the dryer too long. If you’re going to resemble anything, that sure makes a fine starting point. The coupe-like profile is meant to entice younger buyers, to whom the typical squared-off-but-practical sedan lines suggest dowdy. For the image-obsessed, there’s also a 2-door version, which makes hauling passengers even less likely than the sedan does.\n\nThis is after all a compact, with an interior volume as calculated by the EPA of just 88.6 cubic feet. For comparison, the country’s best-selling family sedan, the Honda Accord, has 101.7, and is rated a midsize – not that there will be much cross-shopping between these two.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class is called a sports sedan by its maker, but might just as well be referred to as a low-end luxury sedan. That denomination would be especially a propos in the case of the one I drove, given the modest power available.\n\nThe C-Class starts at $29,950, but I imagine you’d have a hard time finding one in the sub-$30K range – there are just too many inducements to spend, spend. If you could find one so spare, it would nonetheless come with a V-6 engine; 6-speed manual transmission; climate control; alloy wheel; leather seating, steering wheel and shift knob; cruise control; electrically-adjustable front seats; AM-FM-WB-cassette stereo; auto headlamps with twilight sensor; power windows; auto dimming rearview mirrors; integrated garage door opener; trip computer, and, of no small significance, the famous three-pointed star stand-up hood ornament. That a good load, and in the safety department, the C comes with antilock, four-wheel disc brakes with brake assist, electronic stability assist, antitheft alarm, dual-stage front air bags, side air bags for driver and co-pilot, and full-length side-curtain air bags.\n\nTo some, the most important add-on might be an automatic transmission, which the tester had. It is a five-speed unit, with what M-B calls Touch Shift. You can leave it in Drive all the time and it will study your style and program itself accordingly for higher or lower shift points and also react to road gradients knowingly. If you want a bit more involvement, flicking the console-mounted lever to the left downshifts, to the right, upshifts. (It won’t perform a requested downshift if that would result in over-revving.)\n\nI found it quite a slick implementation, preferable to those which require the gated shifter to be first moved into the semi-auto mode. As an adaptive transmission, it was middle of the pack in smarts, I thought, and could be confused by erratic power -on, power-off sequences. There’s a gear-selected indicator amid the instruments, but it’s too small and, being a yellowish-orange, hard to decipher.\n\nIt is good to have five forward gears, especially with the lesser engine under the hood. The base powerplant is a 2.6-liter (so much for the rationality of German model-naming conventions) single-overhead-camshaft aluminum job with three valves per cylinder (two in, one out).\n\nIt is rated at 168 hp (@5,500 rpm) and 177 foot-pounds of torque (@4,500). There are two coils and two sparkplugs per cylinder also, which contribute to its coveted low-emissions-vehicle status.\n\nWith a curb weight of 3,415 pounds (base car with automatic), the engine is hardly overqualified for this rear-drive machine. The best it could manage in the 0-60 dash was just a tick under 9 seconds, which puts it at something of a competitive disadvantage, on paper at least. But Mercedes has used those five forward ratios to good advantage (first is extremely l and the final drive ratio is up there, too: 3.46:1). As a result, launch feel is robust, and never does the car feel like a slug. But for the stopwatch, I would have guessed much better straight-line performance.\n\nEPA estimates (premium fuel, please), are 20 mpg city, 26 highway. I logged 22.6.\n\nThe stroked version of this engine displaces 3.2 liters and makes 215 hp and 221 foot-pounds. To get it, you must lay out $7,500 more for a C-320, which comes only with automatic and shaves a couple of seconds off the classic American sprint time.\n\nIf you want the baddest boy in town, Mercedes’ hotrod partner AMG offers a C320 with a supercharger and sundry other tweaks (349 hp, and a chassis to match), for an entry fee of $51K and change. That would almost be scary.\n\nOn the road, the C240 felt like . . . well, a shrunken version of the S-Class. So tight was body and chassis it felt less like a collection of thousands of elements screwed, bolted and adhesived together than a casting on wheels. With rack-and-pinion steering replacing the former recirculating ball system, the Cs have gained some road feel, and hold a course with dogged determination. The included stability control mechanism – which can apply braking force to one wheel at a time when the driver seeks to flout the laws of physics – acted like a guardian angel on surfaces of varying tenacity. One would have to work at losing it with this package.\n\nRide quality is very good, even over badly neglected surfaces.\n\nThe cabin is very quiet, even at elevated speeds, thanks both to splendid chassis isolation and an extraordinarily low coefficient of drag – 0.27.\n\nBraking is up to the task of bringing this car down from its (governed) top speed of 130 mph. The large discs front and rear make for excellent pedal feel and exceptionally short stopping distances. “Brake assist” senses when the driver is making a panic stop and applies the binders more quickly than normal, while the antilock smoothly keeps the wheels turning at the limit of adhesion. The test machine had the upgraded Bose stereo, which was exemplary in overall tonality, though only so-so in FM sensitivity – that dumb in-glass antenna again. The feds have not yet crash-tested the new C-Class, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has.\n\nAfter subjecting it to a 40-mph offset frontal collision, they rated it a top pick in what they call the midsize luxury class, giving it their top rating – good – in every category of occupant protection. The Volvo S80 did comparably well, followed closely by the BMW 3 Series and more distantly by the Saab 9-5 and Audi A6.\n\nAlas, the IIHS bumper-bashing was not so kind to the C-Class. In a series of four, front and rear, 5-mph impacts with flat barriers and poles, it racked up estimated repair costs of $4,674. The S80 was far worse – at $7,860 – while the Audi A6 and BMW 3-Series were much better, but still in the $2,000 range. The C-class suffered its most exp ensive mishap backing into a pole – $2,484 worth. If the bumper system is going to be so fragile, it would seem cost-effective to equip the car with a radar warning system, as some van makers do.\n\nI had but one basic quarrel with this car, but it would keep me from buying one. It’s compact, and I’m not. The “B” pillar, the one between front and rear doors, was located unusually far forward. This meant I had to perform a contortionist act to attain driving position, similar to what’s required with a low-slung coupe. After a week of this, I had a sore back – really. If you’re six feet or more, do give it a fair test. There’s always the E-Class . . . .\n\nThe tester had an optional “brilliant silver” paint job (gorgeous), for $625; the automatic trannie, $1,300; the Bose upgrade, $595; cell phone and CD-changer package, $1,795; rain sensor, power moonroof and electric rear sunshade, $1,340, and headlamp washers and heated front seats, $800. Total, with freight, thus swelled to $3700 ayments on that car would be $751, assuming 20 percent down, 48 installments and 10 percent interest. It doesn’t hurt to ask, but don’t count on a discount at this point.",

      "expert_review": "The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is the smallest of the esteemed marque’s U.S. product line. It’s not in the same league as the midsize E-Class sedan, and wouldn’t get the time of day from its snooty cousin, the magnificent S-Class. But it still must be held to a very high standard, considering not only the historic associations of the three-pointed star it wears, but also the price.\n\nThis humblest of Benzes, with just a smattering of options, still costs what 10 serviceable clunkers would, or perhaps one and a half very nice new compact cars. The bottom line on the sticker of the one I tested was $38,195, about 50 percent more than the current average transaction price of all new cars and trucks sold in the U.S.\n\nIs it that good? Well, yes and no. It’s a true Mercedes, with all the favorable connotations that implies, but the C-Class is coming to the end of the line . . . following a seven-year run, a revamped version will be out this fall, and I’m betting it will be more than incrementally better – it certainly LOOKS better.\n\nThe current crop of Cs, while not so wannabe-looking as the prior generation of “Baby Benzes,” do look a bit like a cheaped-down version of the real thing. And there’s room for updating the chassis, too, although even in its senescence, it’s better than most. Remarkable advances in engineering and manufacturing have occurred since the last major revision, however, and I’m eager to see how M-B engineers have embraced them.\n\nThe C-Class has lost one of its members. The hotrodded C43 AMG variant, with its fire-breathing 8-cylinder engine, has been dropped from the books. What remain are two series differentiated less by what they do than how they do it.\n\nThe base model (starts at $31,750) is the C230. The deduced 2.3 liters is distributed among four cylinders – now hold on a sec – which take abnormally large gulps of gas thanks to a supercharger, whence the series derives its formal designation: C230 Kompressor. The air pump and premium fuel conspire to produce 185 hp and 200 foot-pounds of torque. That’s impressive output for a tidy little engine, capable of propelling the car from 0-60 in a little over 8 seconds, according to the factory, a claim that seems plausible, given the 3,250 pounds of mass. Better blastoffs – never a priority for German cars – could be had with a manual transmission, but all C-Class cars come only with a (superb) 5-speed automatic.\n\nThe car I tested was the C280. You don’t have to be one of those dull-normals on Millionaire to guess 6 cylinders, 2.8 liters. Base price is $35,950 and output is remarkably close to the Kompressor’s: 194 hp and 195 foot-pounds, both figures within the margin for production variances. The Kompressor’s torque curve peaks lower and stays flat longer, offering perhaps a better subjective feel, especially with an automatic, but the V-6 is smoother and quieter, and seems to want to keep climbing the rpm scale forever. The V-6 might have a slight edge in longevity, but for a $4K difference . . . one might be willing to take a chance on the blower.\n\nInterior volume is 88 cubic feet, putting the C in compact territory. Mercedes does not indulge in wishful thinking, but rather markets it as a four-place car, a particularly good idea when there’s a rear-drive driveline hump to account for. The rear was rather snug in the fore-and-aft direction and headroom was at a premium, too. The rear door openings are narrow and require some agility. The rear bench – with an option package – folds to expand the 13-c.f. trunk. Up front, all is well, even for well-padded folks. The 10-way power driver’s seat could be tailored for a perfect fit, and I found a position of comfort an inch or two forward of the rearmost stops. The seats typically feel underpadded at first blush, but get better and better as the miles pile up.\n\nThe C280 normally sits on adequate 205/60/15 Continental tir light-alloy wheels are standard. The tester had the sport package, which increases wheel diameter to 16 inches and reduces the profile to 55, while using higher-rate springs and revalved shocks along with beefier traction bars front and rear. All these factors contribute to crisper handling, if not awesome lateral adhesion. I was surprised at how eager the rear end was to whip around when the tires had had enough, but in more temperate driving, the feeling was one of crisp responsiveness, with good feedback.\n\nThe ride quality was taut, with a smidge of harshness at times over very bad pavement, but on the whole, would not be tiring on a long march. There’s a bit more noise than one would like in this luxury class, both suspension and tires contributing in equal measure. Still, even at 70 mph on good roads, the decibel level doesn’t rise above average.\n\nThe C Class is replete with safety features, front air bags of course, as well as side bags for driver and co-pilot, along with four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, electronic stability control, full-range traction control and Brake Assist. The stability control uses one-wheel braking and/or throttle dampening to keep the driver from asking for more cornering than the car can give, while the traction control does its best to keep the rear, driving wheels turning at the same rate.\n\nMercedes’ trademarked Brake Assist senses when the brakes are being jabbed unusually quickly and shaves some vital milliseconds from the time between pressing the brake pedal and full actuation. As on the larger members of the family, the Brake Assist and antilock conspired to produce powerful, well-controlled stops when I slammed the brakes, even on wet surfaces.\n\nAlso included is the TeleAid system, a cellular transmitter/receiver independent of any that might or might not be present for calling purposes. With a push of the SOS button, TeleAid contacts a service provider which can dispatch emergency services. The transmitter sends the car’s model color and precise location, using onboard Global Positioning System tracking data. A call is automatically placed if any air bag is deployed, and if the dispatcher gets no response, emergency services are sent. Two other one-push buttons establish communications with Mercedes’ roadside assistance provider or an owner information center for those who don’t like to read manuals. If the car is stolen, the system can be queried for a precise location via GPS. That’s fun.\n\nThe test car had the Special Edition package, which includes, for $1,600, the sport package discussed above, two-tone leather interior, fold-down rear seat, power moonroof, integrated CD changer, stainless steel door sills and a StarTac cell phone. Total price, with freight, was $38,195.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Expensive hot rods have hit the big time, with wealthy collectors spending nearly as much for famous customs as they do for vintage Ferraris and Duesenbergs.\n\nHere’s another way to spend big bucks on a hot rod, the Mercedes-Benz C32 AMG. And it’s a real sleeper. What looks like a modest compact sedan is actually a tight, powerful performer that will hunker down and run away from nearly anything else on the road.\n\nMercedes’ performance division, AMG, added a supercharger to create a 349-horsepower V-6, with a muscular 332 pounds-feet of torque, that hauls this 3,500-pound car like a rocket, reaching 60 from zero in just over five seconds. AMG, which was an outside tuner until Mercedes brought it in-house, also added stiffer suspension, stronger brakes, and a set of 17-inch alloy wheels and Pirelli P-Zero tires to make the C32 a formidable package of power and handling.\n\nAlso formidable is C32’s $50,000 price tag, compared with about $35,000 for a non-enhanced C320 with a 215-horsepower V-6.\n\nThe C32 is Benz’s effort to match the M3 of archrival BMW, though it’s a tossup depending on personal preference. The enviable choice between C32 or M3 is a comparison of superlatives. These are performance heavyweights despite their small sizes.\n\nThe C32 falls behind the M3 only because there is no manual-shifting option, especially since Mercedes now has a superb six-speed that it offers in other C-Class and SLK models.\n\nThe five-speed automatic works flawlessly, though. The Speedshift system, which creates faster and more-precise shifting, as well as allowing manual-shift functions, always seems to be in the right place at the right instant.\n\nThough Mercedes-Benz is famous for its exceptional large cars, my favorite Benzes are the smaller ones. The big S-Class and CL cars may be smooth, powerful and technologically sophisticated, but I like the tight performance of the small models.\n\nThe C32 had all the hallmarks of the German automaker: the solid structure often referred to as vaultlike, the heavy but precise steering, the rich interior. On this sedan, the weight is subjugated by the lightness of acceleration, braking and handling.\n\nThis car is sharply fast and maneuverable. On winding side roads, C32 showed itself to be capable, predictable and unflappable, even when pushed hard. Part of this effect is electronic with Mercedes’ Electronic Stability Program helping keep things under control. Unlike some handling programs, ESP never seemed to intrude on the experience.\n\nThe braking is stupendous, real race-track stuff. Four big discs are cross-drilled and vented for consistent stopping power. Four-channel antilock braking is standard.\n\nThere are some comfort compromises related to the sports suspension, which can get harsh enough to rattle your teeth.\n\nAside from its performance, the C32 is a totally practical car, very tractable at low speeds, and with a comfortable interior, spacious trunk an d most features desired by luxury car buyers.\n\nThis is a small car, and rear-seat passengers may have to crunch up to fit in, although the driver and front passenger will find plenty of space. The AMG treatment includes leather seats that are supportive and bolstered to keep you in place during sporty maneuvers.\n\nThe dashboard of the C32 is mercifully free of gimmick or gadget, with straightforward controls and adjustments in a simple arrangement.\n\nThe stereo was excellent except for one thing: no CD player. I mention this because, at more than $50,000, some things should just be there.\n\nOtherwise, the C32 came with the full run of luxury and convenience equipment. There was also an impressive array of safety features, such as side-impact curtains and Tele Aid emergency calling and communications.\n\nThe only extras were $640 for “desert silver” paint, and $665 shipping and handling.\n\nOh, and one other thing: $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. For a compact car, MPG f the AMG doesn’t satisfy the EPA .\n\nMercedes-Benz C32 AMG\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $49,900.\n\nPrice as tested: $52,205.\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter V-6, supercharged, 349 horsepower at 6,100 rpm, 332 pounds-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 106.9 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,540 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 17 city, 22 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\n– Awesome power.\n\n– Excellent handling.\n\n– Amazing brakes.\n\nLows:\n\n– Premium price.\n\n– Suspension harshness.\n\n– No stick shift.",

The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nA 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and heated front seats are now standard.

We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS\n\nLooks like: A mild update on the 2015-18 C300\n\nDrivetrain: 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with nine-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2018\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan, which earned Cars.com’s top award with its 2015 model-year redesign, enters the fifth model year of its current generation with styling updates, more power and new technology. The visual changes are mild, but new technologies close the gap with the larger E-Class sedan, which Mercedes redesigned more recently.\n\nRelated: More 2018 Geneva Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe updated C-Class will debut at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show in C300 sedan form — that is, with the base engine most Americans buy. It goes on sale in the U.S. late in 2018. No details are available yet on the 2019 C-Class coupe, convertible (cabriolet) or higher-performance AMG versions.\n\nExterior\n\nMercedes-Benz claims redesigns for the bumpers, headlights and taillights, but the revisions are light. Full-LED lights, which were previously optional, are now standard. They have reorganized elements but the same basic shape; the same goes for the bumpers. With an optional AMG styling package, the C300 gets a diamond-pattern grille with a single crossbar that was previously reserved for AMG C43 versions of the sedan. The outboard bumper openings have crossbars, too, similar to certain versions of the E-Class and S-Class.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the 2019 C-Class gets a redesigned steering wheel with touch-sensitive buttons and cruise controls directly on the wheel instead of the previous steering-column stalk. The larger change comes with the optional information displays, however. A 7-inch multimedia display is standard, as are physical gauges with a 5.5-inch center display. But new options include configurable 12.3-inch virtual gauges that replace the physical units and a 10.25-inch multimedia screen instead of the 2018’s optional 8.4-inch screen.\n\nWireless smartphone charging is available, as is a Burmester premium stereo.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe 2015-18 C300’s turbocharged four-cylinder pulled middling acceleration numbers among seven luxury sports sedans in our last acceleration tests, but some extra power might move it up a notch. Output for 2019 is now 255 horsepower, up from last year’s 241 hp; torque, at 273 pounds-feet, remains unchanged. A nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive (4Matic) is optional.\n\nSafety\n\nMercedes-Benz touts similar safety and autonomous tech in the 2019 C-Class as it offers in the E-Class. Improved cameras and radar can see up to nearly a third of a mile ahead, as well as 130 feet to the sides and 260 feet behind — all of which enables the C-Class to drive “semi-autonomously in certain situations,” according to Mercedes. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is standard, but it’s unclear which additional features are optional or standard.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class compact luxury car is available as a sedan, coupe or convertible. The C300 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the AMG C 43 gets a 385-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The high-performance AMG C 63 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 469 or 503 hp. All engines work with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Lexus IS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nBlind spot warning, keyless access and a hands-free trunk lid are standard. The coupe and convertible also gain a Burmester premium stereo.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a 10.25-inch multimedia screen, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Available features include a digital instrument panel, navigation, a head-up display, wireless charging, three-zone automatic air conditioning, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a driver-drowsiness monitor. Available features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-keeping assist and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class?\n\nWhile the C-Class favors comfort over driving performance, it’s still a poised and powerful compact luxury car. Interior luxury is a highlight, as is the car’s multimedia system. We also like the range of available body styles and engines. We did notice, however, that the car’s backseat cushion is close to the floor, which may be uncomfortable for some passengers.",

      "expert_review": "It’s hard to think of a better time to be a luxury performance-sedan enthusiast. If you have about $60,000 to spend, the array of choices available to you is wide, including well-known models like the BMW M3 and newcomers like the Lexus IS-F. Then there’s the latest high-powered version of Mercedes-Benz’s C-Class: the 451-horsepower C63 AMG, an incredibly powerful, extremely firm-riding version of the entry-level luxury sedan.\n\nThe C63 AMG makes a significant break from its German and Japanese competitors by using a time-tested American technique for delivering big horsepower: stuff a big engine under the hood. Think of this 6.2-liter V-8 sedan as a German interpretation of an American muscle car.\n\nIf you’ve stumbled upon this review looking for more information on the regular C-Class, I reviewed that car last year when it was redesigned.\n\nStyling\nLike performance models from BMW and Audi, the C63 AMG receives a number of exterior changes that distinguish it from lesser C-Class trims without diminishing its level of sophistication. A couple of the more noticeable ones include twin bumps running the length of the hood, front fender flares, 18-inch alloy wheels, quad tailpipes finished in chrome, and a few extra badges. There’s a kind of seriousness to the C63 AMG’s look that would make a Secret Service agent proud (see a side-by-side comparison with the C350 Sport).\n\nRide & Handling\nOf its contemporaries, the C63 AMG’s suspension tuning is among the firmest; the only model that rivals it is the Audi RS 4, which has a downright bone-jarring ride on rutted roads. On the worn roads of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs, the C63 AMG’s extra-firm ride isn’t enjoyable, as you’re constantly tossed around with every road heave or pothole.\n\nIt makes sense that Mercedes would give the C63 AMG a firm ride in order to enhance its performance on the track, but the BMW M3 — one of its prime competitors — shows you don’t have to sacrifice comfort to the extent that the C63 AMG does in order to turn in an impressive performance on the track. In daily driving, the M3 doesn’t ride much more firmly than a non-M sibling, like the 335i, but it can navigate a serious road course like a champ. I haven’t had any track time in the C63 AMG, and it may well be a strong track car, but it takes a significant toll on the driver in everyday driving.\n\nThe Mercedes’ base suspension setup is even more puzzling when you consider that an optional AMG Performance Package includes a limited-slip differential, special brakes, a different steering wheel, a higher 174-mph top speed limiter and a track-tuned suspension. One bright spot in the C63 AMG’s regular suspension is that the sedan remains relatively flat when cornering, with limited body roll.\n\nThe C63 features an AMG speed-sensitive steering system that provides greater steering feel than the regular C-Class. The sedan feels locked in when cruising on the highway, but it retains some traditional Mercedes characteristics, including plenty of power assistance at slow speeds that makes it easy to turn the wheel. You can, however, feel suspension impacts through the steering wheel when driving on rough patches of road.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nEven though its name might suggest otherwise, the C63 AMG has a 6.2-liter V-8 engine under its hood, and it’s an impressive engine. It had to be; competitors like the RS 4, M3 and IS-F offer very good V-8s, too. None of those, however, can match the output of Mercedes’ monster motor.\n\nThe C63 AMG’s normally aspirated V-8 makes 451 hp at 6,800 rpm and 443 pounds-feet of torque at 5,000 rpm. Cadillac’s new CTS-V bests those figures by significant margins, but its V-8 benefits from a supercharger.\n\nOne of the first things you realize when driving the C63 AMG — especially on the highway — is that this car builds speed quickly with a subtlety that’s surprising. One time I looked down at the speedometer and was surprised to find I was traveling at 70 mph; it felt like the car was hardly exerting itself. This Mercedes has the kind of power that, if you ever dared test it on public roads, could have you traveling at speeds that would get your driver’s license cut up on the spot.\n\nOf course, if you’re not in the mood for subtlety all you have to do is mash the gas pedal and the C63 AMG lunges forward with a deep growl bellowing from the quad exhaust tips. This ever-present wall of power lets you pass at speeds that make other cars seem like they’re standing still; Mercedes says the C63 AMG can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. Gas mileage is an SUV-like 12/19 mpg city/highway, which incurs a $2,100 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nThe V-8’s strong torque output makes transmission downshifts less critical here than in cars that have less power. Still, the C63 AMG’s seven-speed automatic transmission makes quick kickdowns when you lay into the gas pedal, but it’s also always working to make sure gear changes are smooth. This is especially evident when using the transmission’s clutchless-manual mode, which is operated by nudging the gear selector left or right, or by using the large paddles attached to the back of the steering wheel. If you let the V-8 rev fairly high before upshifting, the transmission makes sure the next gear engages smoothly.\n\nEven though the automatic transmission is relatively good at delivering a smooth yet sporty experience, the lack of a true manual transmission is going to be a deal-breaker for some shoppers. While that isn’t as significant in Mercedes’ larger AMG cars like the E63 AMG and S63 AMG, it’s relevant to shoppers considering smaller luxury performance sedans like the C63 AMG, whose competitors do offer a stick. That said, Mercedes says a manual isn’t offered in the C63 AMG because the demand isn’t there.\n\nThe C63 AMG has 14-inch front brake discs grasped by six-piston calipers, and 13-inch rear discs stopped by four-piston calipers. The brakes respond to light pedal effort, but bringing the sedan to a smooth stop isn’t always easy; the brakes are a bit grabby.\n\nThe Inside\nSince its 2008 redesign, I’ve thought the C-Class has had a rather plain — if nicely crafted — cabin. That opinion carries over to the C63 AMG, as its cabin is much the same as the regular C-Class’, though with a few special cues. Those include a unique instrument panel, a flat-bottom steering wheel and front sport seats. The sport seats are much more comfortable than the hard seats in the regular C-Class, featuring aggressive side bolsters that clutch your torso. The bolsters are adjustable and the seats also include upper and lower lumbar adjustments.\n\nOne of the more interesting elements of the cabin is the motorized dashboard screen. It’s stored behind a panel in the center of the dash, but at the touch of a button the panel backs away and a 7-inch screen rises from the dash. It looks like a miniature flat-panel television, and its high-quality graphics reinforce this impression.\n\nThe screen is included with Mercedes’ optional Comand system, which features a small multifunction dial in the center console that’s used to control audio, navigation and other functions. The on-screen menu layout is why it’s one of the more intuitive knob-based control systems on the market, ahead of the likes of BMW’s iDrive and Audi’s MMI. Less-appealing interior elements include slightly creaky door pulls and loose temperature dials for the automatic air-conditioning system.\n\nLike the M3, RS 4 and IS-F, the C63’s backseat is snug. I’m 6-foot-1 and was able to sit back there with the front seat adjusted for me, but I didn’t have any legroom to spare. Backseat cushioning is firm.\n\nCargo\nThe C63 AMG’s trunk measures 12.4 cubic feet, which is similar to what competitors offer. The trunk is also where the releases are located for the split, folding backseat; there’s a handle for each backrest section, and pulling them releases the seatback so they can be folded flush with the cargo floor.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags.\n\nFeatures\nMercedes offers a few option packages for the C63 AMG. In addition to the previously mentioned AMG Performance Package, which costs $3,990, there’s the $2,980 AMG Seating Package that includes higher-quality leather upholstery, memory settings for the driver and front-passenger seats and a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel (the standard adjustments are manual).\n\nThe $1,100 Premium 2 Package adds a power sunshade for the rear window, bi-xenon headlights with a washer system and fog lamps that light when cornering for better visibility. Finally, there’s the $2,980 Multimedia Package that includes the Comand system with navigation, the 7-inch motorized screen and a Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system with a dash-mounted six-CD changer and 6GB of music storage. Individual options include carbon fiber trim pieces ($2,500) and a kit that lets you play and control an iPod through the audio system ($375).\n\nC63 AMG in the Market\nAfter a week of testing, I had conflicting emotions when the C63 AMG left my care. Even though the V-8 engine drinks premium gas with environment-be-damned abandon, it was still sad to say goodbye to its powerful performance and burly exhaust note. On the flip side, there were no tears shed at the departing of the sedan’s sport suspension, which is just too firm for everyday driving.\n\nAnd that’s the essence of this sedan. Like the Audi RS 4, it offers a thrilling V-8 engine but comes with ride quality that’s hard to stomach. For shoppers looking for more of a balance between everyday livability and track-readiness, there’s an alternative in the M3, which offers rewarding V-8 power and standout handling but won’t rough you up nearly as much as the Benz.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Redesigned for 2022, the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan’s advanced technology and fun-to-drive elements can’t paper over its serious flaws.\n\nVersus the competition: Mercedes can’t decide if the C300 competes against the Tesla Model 3, an upstart Genesis G70 or a traditional luxury sports sedan like the Audi A4 or BMW 3 Series — and it’s ended up behind them all.\n\nLuxury cars are no longer solely about nice materials, meticulous build quality and impressive performance. These days, technological advancement is just as important, and Mercedes-Benz finds itself at the heart of that competition. The automaker has an EQ lineup of electric vehicles and an advanced Mercedes-Benz User Experience system, and it’s even moved toward electrifying its AMG performance cars — all evidence that it’s aware of the luxury market’s sea change. But the automaker can’t seem to consistently execute these changes well, and the C300 sedan is the latest victim of Stuttgart’s attempts.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Honey, I Shrunk the S-Class\n\nInside and out, the C-Class has been redesigned in the image of its much bigger S-Class sibling. It features upmarket exterior styling and interior technology, including a standard tablet-style 11.9-inch touchscreen with the latest MBUX operating system. The base C300 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, making 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The mild-hybrid system can briefly add a boost of 20 hp and 148 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWe drove a 2022 C300 sedan with 4Matic all-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive is standard), but the car is unchanged for the 2023 model year. A host of options took its $46,600 starting price (with AWD) all the way to $60,870 (all prices include destination). Big-ticket options included a Multimedia Package that added a head-up display and augmented reality navigation (though not in the same display, as they appear on higher-level Benzes), plus a Driver Assistance Package that brought adaptive cruise control, lane change assist and blind spot assist with intersection collision warning. There was also an AMG Line With Night Package that added performance-oriented design cues and features. Our test C300 came equipped with winter tires, though unfortunately, our time in the car coincided with some unusually warm November days.\n\nWe had mixed feelings about the redesigned S-Class when we reviewed it. Would similar changes to the C-Class cause similar problems?\n\nDriven to Frustration\n\nThe new mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder and nine-speed automatic transmission are an excellent combination. Power comes effortlessly and the car practically leaps forward with a tap of the accelerator pedal; some editors actually thought it was too touchy. When you stand on the accelerator, power just keeps coming. The addition of the mild-hybrid system makes the engine stop-start system’s operation seamless, which adds to the feeling of luxury.\n\nThe C300’s handling also impresses; it feels as nimble and agile as any non-high-performance model in its class. The AMG Line With Night Package includes a sport suspension, sport-tuned steering and a thicker sport steering wheel that makes for a confident grip. I just wish the C300’s steering feel matched its agility; there’s an unwelcome nonlinearity to it that makes it feel as though the car has completed a maneuver before the driver has finished turning the wheel.\n\nOther aspects of driving the C300 are even more frustrating. The AMG Line With Night Package includes a sport brake system with drilled front rotors, joining that bordering-on-touchy accelerator pedal with a brake pedal with the opposite problem: There’s far too much travel, leaving it feeling almost entirely disconnected from the actual braking process. Having almost no communication from the pedal makes achieving a smooth stop difficult.\n\nBeyond that, ride quality is overly harsh. Given the car’s winter tires and our unseasonably warm weather, we expected a mushy, overly cushioned ride because winter tires are softer than all-season or summer tires, and they usually have more sidewall, too. What we got was a brittle, harsh ride that made every trip more exhausting than necessary.\n\nIn its sportiest setting, the C300’s exhaust makes a pleasant, low rumble — or at least it seems to from inside the car. In reality, the exhaust sound is so augmented that it’s much louder inside the cabin than outside. Also not helping the C300’s cause are the large and obviously fake exhaust finishers in the rear bumper; the actual exhaust tips protrude under the car and are visible to drivers behind the C300. Such easily broken illusions detract from the sense of luxury.\n\nOwners do have to use premium gas — that most luxurious of fuels. Fuel economy for the C300 4Matic is average for an AWD luxury sports sedan with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine: The EPA rates the 2023 sedan at 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nOverdone Tech\n\nMercedes-Benz trickled S-Class technology down to the C-Class, and it brought most of the same issues here as it did in that car — plus some new ones. You’ll find most of those problems in the 11.9-inch tablet-style touchscreen, which is also where most of the controls are located (the first problem). Fewer physical controls in or around the center console of a car can be mitigated by steering-wheel controls, but the C300’s steering wheel has touch-sensitive controls, including an especially aggravating volume slider.\n\nWe called out the S-Class for the needless complications in its MBUX multimedia system, and most of that carries over to the C-Class. I can forgive the C-Class a bit given its target buyer is likely more familiar with modern technology (millennials don’t usually field tech-support calls from other millennials), but it’s still needlessly complex. Bodies of water in the (optional) navigation map shimmer, and buildings are lit up at night. It’s distracting. Even more distracting is the augmented reality navigation display in the central touchscreen. In more expensive Mercedes, the AR navigation appears in the head-up display, but it’s relegated to the touchscreen here and distracts more than it helps. A camera system displays the view ahead of the car on the screen and places virtual navigation icons over the image. Keeping this in the driver’s line of sight via the head-up display isn’t perfect and takes some getting used to, but looking down and to the right to see them on a touchscreen is much worse.\n\nWhat this all feels like is an attempt to compete with the Tesla Model 3. Features like AR navigation appear to exist simply because they can, not because they improve the driving experience. The lack of physical buttons feels more futuristic, but it’s hard to argue it’s luxurious; a lack of physical controls likewise makes the S-Class feel less luxurious.\n\nOne piece of tech that does feel like a highlight in the C-Class is the digital instrument panel. It’s easily configurable, clear and easy to read. There’s nothing to set it apart from a variety of digital instrument panels in more and less affordable mainstream and luxury vehicles — BMWs, Toyotas, Fords and the like — but at least it works well. The same goes for the voice command feature, which is activated with a simple “Hey, Mercedes.”\n\nInterior Issues\n\nAnother problem with the C300 is that its interior just isn’t a very comfortable place to be. Other editors and I had issues finding a comfortable driving position, and the backseat felt cramped. A large center floor hump cuts into foot room back there, and head- and legroom are also on the smaller side. This isn’t unusual for the class, but that doesn’t make it any less aggravating.\n\nInterior materials quality was also mixed. Not one of our editors believed the upholstery on the seats was all real leather despite the “Power Red/black leather” line item on our test vehicle’s window sticker.\n\nOn the positive side, there is some ability to  personalize the interior to the driver’s taste thanks to a configurable instrument panel and adjustable ambient lighting. It’s one of the first times I’ve actually enjoyed adjusting the ambient lighting in a test vehicle.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Earns IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus Award\n2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 Brings F1 Tech to the Masses (Who Can Afford a Mercedes)\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Upscale Tech, Upmarket Price\nResearch Luxury Vehicles\nShop for a 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nSafety\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2022 Top Safety Pick+, the organization’s highest designation. To earn that rating, a vehicle must ace a variety of crash tests, all trim levels must offer headlights that earn a rating of at least acceptable, and the car’s vehicle-to-vehicle and daytime vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash prevention systems must be rated at least advanced. The C-Class’ standard Active Brake Assist and optional Active Brake Assist with Cross-Traffic Function both meet the front crash prevention standards. Mercedes-Benz is known for its a la carte options structure — again, our test vehicle’s options added almost $15,000 — and while some safety features are standard, the more advanced systems remain added-cost options. Some luxury brands (Genesis and Lexus, for example) make many of these features standard.\n\nFalling Further Behind\n\nFive years ago, a C300 came in third in our comparison of seven luxury sports sedans. Since then, its competitors have improved while Mercedes seems to have lost its way.\n\nWhat the C300 offers owners now is a frustrating, tech-laden package with a three-pointed star on the grille. There just aren’t enough enjoyable driving qualities to make the C300 worth a recommendation over its competitors; Alfa Romeo, BMW and Genesis all make cars that are more fun to drive, and if you’re simply looking to show off all the cool techy things your car can (but probably shouldn’t) do, get a Tesla Model 3 and shell out for Full Self Driving.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2010 about the 2010 Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nTraditionally the cheapest bed at Hotel Benz, the C-Class sedan has been a success for Mercedes. It’s outsold its larger siblings eight of the past 10 years — despite the fact that some versions have presented a cut-rate side to the brand.\n\nNow well into its third generation, the 2010 C-Class is competent, but its cost-cutting interior ranks it below a number of competitors on the luxury ladder.\n\nTrim levels for the C-Class include the C300 Sport, C300 Luxury and C350 Sport; click here to compare them with the 2009 C-Class. There’s also a high-performance C63 AMG, which we cover in greater detail in our review of the ’09 model. All four cars come standard with rear-wheel drive; the C300 Sport and Luxury offer Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel drive. I evaluated an all-wheel-drive C300 Sport.\n\nSmall, Stately\n\nGerman sport sedans aren’t a plus-sized group, and the C-Class is among the smallest. With a footprint roughly equal to that of a Nissan Sentra, the C-Class looks like a miniature version of Mercedes’ S-Class flagship. Other than the tail’s awkward forward-leaning stance, it’s a well-proportioned look — and it’s aging better than the prior-generation’s portly curves.\n\nC300 Luxury models have a traditional three-pointed star hood ornament. All others drape a larger emblem over the grille itself. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the C300 and C350, with 18-inchers optional. C300 Luxury models have unique bumpers and side sills, which make for a more formal — if less dynamic — look. The C63 AMG, conversely, has unique bodywork and standard 18-inch wheels. Xenon headlights are optional across all trims.\n\nCity drivers will appreciate the narrow 35.3-foot turning circle for C300 and C350 models, but tight alleys reveal limitations thanks to the folding side mirrors. (My garage opens to a tight alley, so it’s become something of a pet peeve.) They don’t fold completely in, or even close to it — and with integrated turn signals, heated surfaces and available motorized folding, knocking one off would mean a hefty repair bill.\n\nFrom Capable to Rip-Roaring\n\nA number of sport sedans offer base engines that accelerate enough but fall short of the effortless passing power expected of a luxury car. Such is the case with the C300. Encumbered by an extra 210 pounds versus rear-drive models, our test car’s 228-horsepower V-6 moved out with adequate thrust. Pushed hard, the seven-speed automatic dispenses quick upshifts, and the engine emits a satisfying exhaust growl as the tach needle swings right.\n\nThe drivetrain’s two driver-selectable modes, Comfort and Sport, alter accelerator sensitivity and automatic transmission shift patterns. Even in its Sport mode, the transmission isn’t eager to kick down, so passing power is modest. But the engine offers good balance: I loaded up enough weight to simulate three adult passengers plus baggage, and the C300 didn’t strain. The BMW 328i and Lexus IS 250 deliver peakier power with lackluster oomph starting out. (As base engines go, the Audi A4’s turbo four-cylinder has the group beat.)\n\nSeveral editors observed some accelerator lag, even in Sport mode. I noticed some, but it’s not as pronounced as in some Mercedes with the automaker’s 5.5-liter V-8. That king-sized V-8 makes up for the lag with effortless power, however; the C300’s V-6 … not so much.\n\nStepping up to the C350 gets you a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, while the C63 AMG has a 451-hp V-8. A performance package with revised engine calibrations bumps that up to 481 hp. Both the V-8 and 3.5-liter V-6 pack a stronger punch — Mercedes says the C63 can hit 60 mph in just over 4 seconds — but neither will be easy to come by. Of the thousands of C-Class sedans in Cars.com’s national new-car inventory, just 5 percent are C350s or C63s. Both cars come with automatics; the C300 Sport also offers a six-speed manual.\n\nHandling, Ride & Braking\n\nMore a cruiser than a corner-carver, the C300 handles OK. Despite our tester’s sport-tuned suspension, midcorner body roll can become intrusive, and the Continental ContiProContact all-season tires lose their grip quickly. Once unsettled, the C300 plows early and often, with too much nose-heavy understeer for a car with rear-drive roots.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with a light touch at low speeds but firms up over switchbacks and during evasive maneuvers, delivering satisfying weight and good turn-in precision over quick cuts left and right. Curiously, prolonged turns — sweeping curves, highway cloverleaves — leave something to be desired. There’s too much power assist, lending sloppy, tentative steering motions. Mercedes says the drivetrain’s Sport mode enhances steering feel, but I noticed little difference. Probably of greater influence is the Dynamic Handling Package, which is optional on rear-wheel-drive Sport models. It includes an adaptive suspension and quicker steering ratio. The C63 AMG, with unique suspension and steering tuning, handles better, but when I drove one last year I noted a wee bit more steering slop than the segment’s performance leader — the BMW M3 — exhibits. Slap on all the performance add-ons you want: A car’s pedigree is hard to shake.\n\nRide comfort with our tester’s 17-inch wheels was good; it could be even better with the C300 Luxury’s regular suspension tuning. The C300 Sport’s setup allows sufficient road feel but soaks up most bumps with muted ka-thuds. In this class, sport packages can render some pretty firm rides — the 3 Series and Infiniti G37 both exhibit this. It’s clear Mercedes butters its bread on the comfort side.\n\nOne of our editors observed some odd body motions at highway speeds. The effect makes it feel as if the car hasn’t settled in yet. I noticed a slight bit of this at low speeds, in a C63 AMG we evaluated last year. Go figure. Either way, it’s disconcerting.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, with cross-drilled front rotors on Sport models. The pedal feels a bit mushy, however; others in this class have more definitive pedal feel. The C63 AMG has larger discs with beefier calipers; in our test car last year, the effect made for a much grabbier pedal.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe C-Class wears the three-pointed star, but closer scrutiny reveals areas of cost-cutting versus the $35,000 competition, let alone Mercedes’ pricier cars. It’s the sort of thing that requires a closer look. At first glance, the cabin seems upscale — the wood and chrome accents are tasteful; the gearshift pulls with weight and precision from Park to Drive. The window switches and turn-signal stalk impart good craftsmanship. But on closer inspection, we found too many areas that rang cheap. The rubbery armrests haven’t the slightest veneer of upholstery. The dashboard has exposed gaps, cheaply grained plastics and flimsy climate dials. The door locks employ the sort of flimsy, roughshod plastic you’d find in an entry-level car, and the three-spoke steering wheel is covered in hardscrabble leather.\n\nTaller drivers may want more front legroom. When the seat was elevated, I had to drive with it all the way back; I’m 5-foot-11. The backseat is tight all around, with limited legroom and narrow doors. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard on the C63 and optional elsewhere. Considering the trunk’s 12.4 cubic feet — class-competitive, but still small — the folding feature is worth getting.\n\nOur tester had leatherette (that’s vinyl) upholstery, which some luxury carmakers offer in base models. Certain competitive examples do a good job simulating real cowhide; this isn’t one of them. The C300’s upholstery is low-rent, rubbery stuff. Real leather seats are optional — but I’m not sure that would improve their comfort. The seats lack lateral support, and several editors found too much lumbar support even with that adjustment dialed all the way back.\n\nOne hit: Mercedes’ optional Comand system. Comand manages the navigation, audio and other systems via a flip-up dashboard screen and a console-mounted knob. I still find it the best of its knob-based peers: Map scrolling, audio track changes and submenu organization are altogether more intuitive than in BMW’s iDrive or Audi’s Multi Media Interface.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nOverall reliability for the current C-Class has been average. In crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the car earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-crush tests, making it an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2010. Standard features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and nine airbags; click here for a full list. Seat-mounted airbags for the rear seats are optional, but the car secured its Top Safety Pick status without them.\n\nThe C300 Sport starts at $33,600 — at the high end of the segment, but it comes well-equipped. Standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, vinyl upholstery, eight-way power front seats, a moonroof and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack. The C300 Luxury runs $35,300; it has a standard automatic transmission, which costs $1,490 on the C300 Sport. All-wheel drive C300s command just over $37,000 in Sport or Luxury trim, but both include the automatic. The C350 starts at $39,750 and is available only with rear-wheel drive and the automatic. The same goes for the C63 AMG, which starts at $57,350 — plus a $2,100 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nClimb the options ladder, and available features include a navigation system, genuine leather, additional power seat controls, full iPod compatibility, heated seats and a backup camera. Typical of Mercedes, some common luxury features are optional no matter how high you go: The C63, despite its near-$60,000 starting price, still upholsters its sport seats in vinyl — and charges extra for real cowhide. “Ridiculous” defined.\n\nCheck all the factory options, and the C63 can top out over $75,000. That’s an eye-watering price, to be sure, but an M3 sedan loaded to the gunwales costs just as much.\n\nC-Class in the Market\n\nSecond only to the 3 Series in terms of sales popularity, the C-Class takes a different tack than its BMW rival. The BMW is dynamically talented but, for some, uninvitingly austere; the Benz is soft and stately. Problem is, others have Mercedes beat at its own game. From the Infiniti G37 to the Audi A4, cabins both richer and roomier can be had for this sort of money — and a number of competitors pack better fuel economy and resale values, too. The C-Class is competent, but in a field of excellent contenders, continuing its sales popularity will require some work.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Traditionally the cheapest bed at Hotel Benz, the C-Class sedan has been a success for Mercedes-Benz. It’s outsold its larger siblings eight of the past 10 years — despite the fact that some versions have presented a cut-rate side to the brand.\n\nNow well into its third generation, the 2010 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is competent, but its cost-cutting interior ranks it below a number of competitors on the luxury ladder.\n\nTrim levels for the C-Class include the C300 Sport, C300 Luxury and C350 Sport; click here to compare them with the 2009 Mercedes-Benz C-Class. There’s also a high-performance C63 AMG, which we cover in greater detail in our review of the ’09 model. All four cars come standard with rear-wheel drive; the C300 Sport and Luxury offer Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel drive. I evaluated an all-wheel-drive C300 Sport.\n\nSmall, Stately\n\nGerman sport sedans aren’t a plus-sized group, and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is among the smallest. With a footprint roughly equal to that of a Nissan Sentra, the C-Class looks like a miniature version of Mercedes’ S-Class flagship. Other than the tail’s awkward forward-leaning stance, it’s a well-proportioned look — and it’s aging better than the prior-generation’s portly curves.\n\nC300 Luxury models have a traditional three-pointed star hood ornament. All others drape a larger emblem over the grille itself. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the C300 and C350, with 18-inchers optional. C300 Luxury models have unique bumpers and side sills, which make for a more formal — if less dynamic — look. The C63 AMG, conversely, has unique bodywork and standard 18-inch wheels. Xenon headlights are optional across all trims.\n\nCity drivers will appreciate the narrow 35.3-foot turning circle for C300 and C350 models, but tight alleys reveal limitations thanks to the folding side mirrors. (My garage opens to a tight alley, so it’s become something of a pet peeve.) They don’t fold completely in, or even close to it — and with integrated turn signals, heated surfaces and available motorized folding, knocking one off would mean a hefty repair bill.\n\nFrom Capable to Rip-Roaring\n\nA number of sport sedans offer base engines that accelerate enough but fall short of the effortless passing power expected of a luxury car. Such is the case with the C300. Encumbered by an extra 210 pounds versus rear-drive models, our test car’s 228-horsepower V-6 moved out with adequate thrust. Pushed hard, the seven-speed automatic dispenses quick upshifts, and the engine emits a satisfying exhaust growl as the tach needle swings right.\n\nThe drivetrain’s two driver-selectable modes, Comfort and Sport, alter accelerator sensitivity and automatic transmission shift patterns. Even in its Sport mode, the transmission isn’t eager to kick down, so passing power is modest. But the engine offers good balance: I loaded up enough weight to simulate three adult passengers plus baggage, and the C300 didn’t strain. The BMW 328i and Lexus IS 250 deliver peakier power with lackluster oomph starting out. (As base engines go, the Audi A4’s turbo four-cylinder has the group beat.)\n\nSeveral editors observed some accelerator lag, even in Sport mode. I noticed some, but it’s not as pronounced as in some Mercedes-Benz with the automaker’s 5.5-liter V8. That king-sized V8 makes up for the lag with effortless power, however; the C300’s V6 … not so much.\n\nStepping up to the C350 gets you a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V6, while the C63 AMG has a 451-hp V8. A performance package with revised engine calibrations bumps that up to 481 hp. Both the V8 and 3.5-liter V6 pack a stronger punch — Mercedes-Benz says the C63 can hit 60 mph in just over 4 seconds — but neither will be easy to come by. Of the thousands of Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedans in Cars.com’s national new-car inventory, just 5 percent are C350s or C63s. Both cars come with automatics; the C300 Sport also offers a six-speed manual. The C350 gets and estimated 20 city mpg and 28 highway mpg, where the C63 AMG is said to get “up to” 18 city mpg and 24 highway mpg.\n\nHandling, Ride & Braking\n\nMore a cruiser than a corner-carver, the C300 handles OK. Despite our tester’s sport-tuned suspension, midcorner body roll can become intrusive, and the Continental ContiProContact all-season tires lose their grip quickly. Once unsettled, the C300 plows early and often, with too much nose-heavy understeer for a car with rear-drive roots.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel turns with a light touch at low speeds but firms up over switchbacks and during evasive maneuvers, delivering satisfying weight and good turn-in precision over quick cuts left and right. Curiously, prolonged turns — sweeping curves, highway cloverleaves — leave something to be desired. There’s too much power assist, lending sloppy, tentative steering motions. Mercedes-Benz says the drivetrain’s Sport mode enhances steering feel, but I noticed little difference. Probably of greater influence is the Dynamic Handling Package, which is optional on rear-wheel-drive Sport models. It includes an adaptive suspension and quicker steering ratio. The C63 AMG, with unique suspension and speed-sensitive steering tuning, handles better, but when I drove one last year I noted a wee bit more steering slop than the segment’s performance leader — the BMW M3 — exhibits. Slap on all the performance add-ons you want: A car’s pedigree is hard to shake.\n\nRide comfort with our tester’s 17-inch wheels was good; it could be even better with the C300 Luxury’s regular suspension tuning. The C300 Sport’s setup allows sufficient road feel but soaks up most bumps with muted ka-thuds. In this class, sport packages can render some pretty firm rides — the 3 Series and Infiniti G37 both exhibit this. It’s clear Mercedes-Benz butters its bread on the comfort side.\n\nOne of our editors observed some odd body motions at highway speeds. The effect makes it feel as if the car hasn’t settled in yet. I noticed a slight bit of this at low speeds, in a C63 AMG we evaluated last year. Go figure. Either way, it’s disconcerting.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, with cross-drilled front rotors on Sport models. The pedal feels a bit mushy, however; others in this class have more definitive pedal feel. The C63 AMG has larger discs with beefier calipers; in our test car last year, the effect made for a much grabbier pedal.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe C-Class wears the three-pointed star, but closer scrutiny reveals areas of cost-cutting versus the $35,000 competition, let alone Mercedes’ pricier cars. It’s the sort of thing that requires a closer look. At first glance, the cabin seems upscale — the wood and chrome accents are tasteful; the gearshift pulls with weight and precision from Park to Drive. The window switches and turn-signal stalk impart good craftsmanship. But on closer inspection, we found too many areas that rang cheap. The rubbery armrests on all four doors haven’t the slightest veneer of upholstery. The dashboard has exposed gaps, cheaply grained plastics and flimsy climate dials. The door locks employ the sort of flimsy, roughshod plastic you’d find in an entry-level car, and the three-spoke steering wheel is covered in hardscrabble leather.\n\nTaller drivers may want more front legroom. When the seat was elevated, I had to drive with it all the way back; I’m 5-foot-11. The backseat is tight all around, with limited legroom and narrow doors. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard on the C63 and optional elsewhere. Considering the trunk’s 12.4 cubic feet — class-competitive, but still small — the folding feature is worth getting.\n\nOur tester had leatherette (that’s vinyl) upholstery, which some luxury carmakers offer in base models. Certain competitive examples do a good job simulating real cowhide; this isn’t one of them. The C-Class C300’s upholstery is low-rent, rubbery stuff. Real leather seats are optional — but I’m not sure that would improve their comfort. The seats lack lateral support, and several editors found too much lumbar support even with that adjustment dialed all the way back.\n\nOne hit: MercedesBenz’s optional Comand system. Comand manages the navigation, audio and other systems via a flip-up dashboard screen and a console-mounted knob. I still find it the best of its knob-based peers: Map scrolling, audio track changes and submenu organization are altogether more intuitive than in BMW’s iDrive or Audi’s Multi Media Interface.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nOverall reliability for the current Mercedes-Benz C-Class has been average. In crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the car earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-crush tests, making it an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2010. Standard features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and nine airbags; click here for a full list. Seat-mounted airbags for the rear seats are optional, but the car secured its Top Safety Pick status without them.\n\nThe C300 Sport starts at $33,600 — at the high end of the segment, but it comes well-equipped. Standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, vinyl upholstery, eight-way power front seats, a moonroof and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack. The C300 Luxury runs $35,300; it has a standard automatic transmission, which costs $1,490 on the C300 Sport. All-wheel drive C300s command just over $37,000 in Sport or Luxury trim, but both include the automatic. The C350 starts at $39,750 and is available only with rear-wheel drive and the automatic. The same goes for the C63 AMG, which starts at $57,350 — plus a $2,100 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nClimb the options ladder, and available features include a navigation system, genuine leather, additional power seat controls, full iPod compatibility, heated seats and a backup camera. Typical of Mercedes-Benz, some common luxury features are optional no matter how high you go on the C-Class ladder: The C63, despite its near-$60,000 starting price, still upholsters its sport seats in vinyl — and charges extra for real cowhide. “Ridiculous” defined.\n\nCheck all the factory options, and the C63 can top out over $75,000. That’s an eye-watering price, to be sure, but an M3 sedan loaded to the gunwales costs just as much.\n\nC-Class in the Market\n\nSecond only to the 3 Series in terms of sales popularity, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class takes a different tack than its BMW rival. The BMW is dynamically talented but, for some, uninvitingly austere; the Benz is soft and stately. Problem is, others have Mercedes-Benz beat at its own game. From the Infiniti G37 to the Audi A4, cabins both richer and roomier can be had for this sort of money — and a number of competitors pack better fuel economy and resale values, too. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is competent, but in a field of excellent contenders, continuing its sales popularity will require some work.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The instrument cluster defines the car. There is the tubular framing of fuel, speedometer and tachometer gauges — traditional for Mercedes-Benz performance models. There are the letters, “AMG,” shorthand for the names of the founders of Mercedes-Benz’s performance engineering division and for the birthplace of one of them.\n\nThe founders are Hans Werner Aufrecht (A) and Erhard Melcher (M). Aufrecht was born near Stuttgart in the village of Grossaspach (G), where AMG began in 1967.\n\nOther indicators of the nature of this week’s car, the 2008 C63 AMG sedan, can be found in the instrument cluster’s main menu. Touch a button on the steering wheel. The “Warm Up” screen, displaying engine oil and coolant temperatures, appears. Another prompt yields “Set Up,” presenting current information on the car’s electronic stability program and transmission mode. And then there is “Race,” allowing the driver, assuming that he or she is so engaged or inclined, to measure lap times around a racetrack.\n\nMy associate, Ria Manglapus, and I were inclined. But we found no opportunity to engage. Thus, this review will lack the passion of published throttle-jockey reports on the car. We had no “early whiff of understeer.” Nor did we “nudge the brakes to settle the rear of the car.” Nor had we “unleashed to the rear wheels . . . the prodigious reserves” of the C63 AMG’s 6.3-liter, 451-horsepower V-8 engine, as one scribe wrote of his driving experience.\n\nNote: The “6.3” rubric is more of a marketing than technical designation. Actual engine displacement, the amount of air and fuel that can be packed into a combustion chamber, is closer to 6.2 liters.\n\nWe burned no rubber and smoked no tires, as Mercedes-Benz is fond of doing in its TV commercials touting the C63 AMG. We simply drove the car, as we would any we own, on city and suburban streets and East Coast highways. Those venues proved thrilling enough. And the C63 AMG, in nearly all respects of driving performance, was lots of fun and wonderfully competent as driven.\n\nThe C63 AMG is not a family car in the manner of Mercedes-Benz’s other entry-level luxury C-Class models — the C300 Sport, C300 Luxury, C300 Sport 4Matic, C300 Luxury 4Matic, or the quite impressive C350 Sport.\n\nWe’ve fallen in love with all of those models, especially the C350, which offers ample power (268 hp), performance, and luxury beyond what most of us would consider “entry level.” But the C350 and its lower-ranked C-Class siblings all feel more inclusive than the C63 AMG. That is, they look and feel expressly designed for drivers and passengers.\n\nThe high-performance C63 AMG, on the other hand, treats passengers as afterthoughts. It is more adept at comfortably seating four people, rather than the five easily accommodated by other C-Class cars. Its styling and stance substantially are more aggressive. Its big V-8 consumes premium gasoline in such prodigious amounts — $85 for approximately 400 miles of driving — “AMG” could stand for “All Money Gone.”\n\nBut that criticism borders on unfair. The AMG division of Mercedes-Benz caters to the Walter Mitty crowd — weekend racers who, with varying degrees of competence and experience, pursue on sanctioned speedways glory that often eludes them in daily life. They are a dedicated crowd, often boisterous in defense of their pastime and brutally dismissive of questions about the environmental and fuel costs of their hobby.\n\nIt is easy for the putatively enlightened to thumb noses at the Walter Mitty group. It is easy, but often hypocritical. The truth is that most of us contain something of the soul of Walter Mitty. Had Ria and I the chance to put the C63 AMG on a sanctioned racetrack, we would have taken it. We would have felt momentarily guilty about building up lots of torque, smoking tires, and trying to launch the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.3 seconds in the manner Mercedes-Benz engineers and professional drivers. But, by golly, we would have put on our track helmets and gone to it, laughing and speeding all the way.\n\nThere is a fine line between hypocrisy and virtue. Think of it as parking a gas-electric hybrid Toyota Prius fuel-sipper outside of a mini-mansion with a solar roof — housing a family of three on a suburban cul-de-sac safely isolated from the potentially unwelcome diversity of mass transit.\n\nLoving the C63 AMG, as we do, is something like that. It has more horsepower than anyone really needs in a compact/mid-size, rear-wheel-drive car. It can run faster than any automobile legally is allowed to run on all public roads in the United States. It is fuel-thirsty. It is in many ways bad, bad, bad. But it is evil that we so very much long for and enjoy, although we ultimately might come to loathe the consequences of our actions.\n\nThe hunger nonetheless remains. We want to, as one of our fellow auto scribes, Andreas Stahl, put it, “nudge the brakes to settle the rear of the car, flick the steering wheel into the corner entry while grabbing 2nd gear with the shift paddles, then turn sharply but not so aggressively as to accelerate the weight transfer, and finally allow the inside tires to mount the painted curb at the apex as we nail the throttle hard.”\n\nYeah. That’s it. That’s what we want. We want this one back.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Alfa Romeo Giulia, Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac CT4 or CT5, Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Volvo S60\n\nLooks like: A baby S-Class … or a big A-Class (we suspect owners will prefer the former comparison)\n\nPowertrain: Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with electric assist to make 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, plus an extra 20 hp and 148 pounds-feet available for short bursts; nine-speed automatic transmission; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2022\n\nMercedes-Benz calls the C-Class its bestselling vehicle. The prior generation came as a sedan, wagon, coupe or convertible, depending on the market, with the reported fate of the two-door variants up in the air. Still, the sedan and wagon drove 2.5 million global sales over more than six calendar years on sale, according to Mercedes — and that’s despite U.S. shoppers not seeing a C-Class wagon since 2005 (no doubt to the grousing of many wagon fans who went and bought an SUV anyway).\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: It’s What’s Inside That Counts\n\nFor 2022, the C-Class gets significant interior updates and changes under the hood, as well as subtler exterior changes that make it look more like both the S-Class flagship sedan and A-Class entry-level sedan.\n\nExterior: S-Class … or A-Class\n\nThe redesigned C-Class is larger in nearly every dimension, save for a slight decrease in height. It’s 2.6 inches longer with an inch-longer wheelbase, and track widths have increased by nearly an inch up front and almost 2 inches out back. The overall body is also about half an inch wider. Height decreases by almost half an inch, but that does not impact headroom, according to manufacturer-cited measurements.\n\nMercedes-Benz says it minimized exterior lines to enhance the appearance on those that remain, particularly the beltline crease just below the windows and power domes in the hood. The grille places the Mercedes star in its center, with either chrome accents or, if you get an optional AMG Line package, chrome for the star and surrounding elements. Eighteen- or 19-inch wheels are available.\n\nIn back, the sculpted rear styling features two-piece taillights for the first time on the C-Class. Overall, the look is very much that of a small S-Class or big A-Class.\n\nInterior: Very Much a Small S-Class\n\nIn terms of design, the standout interior pieces are a standard 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and tablet-oriented 11.9-inch center display. The bad news, if you’re a stickler for physical controls like many consumers, is that there appear to be very few in the entire dashboard. Controls mounted on the steering wheel are all capacitive-touch, and most of the other functions are controlled through the center tablet display.\n\nTo counteract that, Mercedes has added the latest version of its MBUX multimedia system, which features what the brand calls robust voice command control, sometimes not even requiring the “Hey Mercedes” prompt depending on the function. (We’d still rather have volume and tuning knobs, or at least the added option.) Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both wireless, are standard.\n\nTo create the feel of a driver-focused cabin, Mercedes angled the dashboard and center display slightly toward the driver. MBUX also has user profiles that can be activated by voice control or a fingerprint scanner, protecting the available payment information used for the Mercedes Me service as well as any other personal information, such as recent or saved destinations and email messages.\n\nThe exterior’s dimensional changes generally carry over to the inside, with most measurements increasing and no major dimensions diminishing. Front legroom remains unchanged from the previous model, with driver headroom increasing by only 0.1 inch. Every other measurement of leg-, elbow- and shoulder room increases by at least half an inch. Cargo volume is also unchanged, at a Mercedes-claimed 17.9 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood: Four for Now\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class | Manufacturer image\n\nAs with the previous C-Class, the C300 will offer a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine that’s rated at the same 255 horsepower. Unlike its predecessor, the engine now includes a 48-volt mild-hybrid integrated starter-generator, as well as a redesigned turbocharger borrowing technology used on the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One racecars. The engine now produces 295 pounds-feet of torque, up from 273. Thanks to the addition of the starter-generator, an extra 20 hp and 148 pounds-feet are available on demand for “short periods.”\n\nMercedes says the updated four-cylinder will hustle either the rear- or all-wheel-drive C300 from 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds, slightly slower than the outgoing C300’s 5.7 seconds, while improving fuel economy. As of now, we don’t know how much more efficient the new C-Class will be, however. A new nine-speed automatic transmission, which Mercedes says is smaller and 30% lighter, also aims to help improve the efficiency of the redesigned sedan.\n\nThe 2022 C-Class also gets new suspension components, and those who opt for the AMG Line will get a sport suspension for improved driving dynamics. No details were shared on any higher-performance versions of the C-Class marketed under Mercedes-AMG, but given their widespread availability elsewhere in the Mercedes lineup, it’s a smart bet they’ll trickle out for the redesigned C-Class sedan in the months to come.\n\nSafety Tech Somewhat Standard\n\nStandard safety features on the new C-Class include automatic forward emergency braking, a blind spot warning system, a driver attention monitor and the Mercedes Pre-Safe pre-collision system. Optional features come mostly via the Driver Assistance Package, which adds adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, active braking assist with detection for cross-traffic and oncoming traffic, active parking assist with a 360-degree camera system and more. A head-up display is also optional. Buyers who opt for the augmented video navigation system also get a forward-facing, windshield-mounted camera that can function as a dashcam.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2022 C300 is expected to arrive in early 2022, with pricing likely announced closer to its on-sale date. The outgoing C300 sedan started at $42,650 (including destination) but could swing well past $50,000 with factory options, and that was before getting to any Mercedes-AMG editions.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nShopping for a Used Car?

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe C-Class gains a flexible-fuel model, the C230, for 2007 and loses its performance version, the C55 AMG.\n\nThe C-Class comes only in sedan body style and features a group of twin-cam V-6 engines: a 201-horsepower 2.5-liter for the C230, a 228-hp 3.0-liter for the C280, and a 268-hp 3.5-liter in the C350.\n\nThe 2007 lineup includes the C230 sport sedan, C280 luxury sedan, and C350 sport and luxury sedans. Active front head restraints that reduce the likelihood of whiplash injuries are standard.\n\nEach sedan has standard rear-wheel drive. Luxury models can have 4Matic all-wheel drive and a five-speed automatic transmission. All V-6 models use a seven-speed automatic, but C230 and C350 sport sedans can be equipped with a six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nExterior\nC-Class models gained redesigned clear headlamps and revised taillamps for 2005. Sport and Luxury models get new, exclusive wheel designs. Bi-xenon headlamps and a moonroof are available.\n\nInterior\nC-Class sedans seat five occupants. Sport sedans feature bird’s-eye maple interior trim. Mercedes-Benz’s Comand and Tele Aid systems are available in all models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree twin-cam V-6 engines with four valves per cylinder are available in C-Class models. The C230 becomes a flexible fuel vehicle, meaning it can run on either E85 or regular gasoline. The C280 sedan has a 228-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, while a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 is installed in C350 sedans. A six-speed manual gearbox or seven-speed automatic with Touch Shift operation can be installed. All-wheel-drive sedans use a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, Mercedes-Benz’s Electronic Stability Program, and side-impact and side curtain airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2005, Luxury editions of Mercedes-Benz’s compact C-Class series got new styling that followed the lead of the 2004 C-Class sport sedan. In addition, the 2005 sport sedans displayed AMG appearance touches that were adapted from the high-performance 2004 C32 AMG model.\n\nThe only C-Class body style still available for the 2006 model year is the sedan; coupes and wagons have been discontinued. A new group of twin-cam V-6 engines goes into the C-Class: a 201-horsepower 2.5-liter for the C230; a 228-hp 3.0-liter for the C280; and a 268-hp 3.5-liter in the C350.\n\nThe 2006 lineup includes the C230 sport sedan, C280 luxury sedan, C350 sport and luxury sedans, and a high-performance C55 AMG sedan with V-8 power. Mercedes-Benz says the C55 AMG can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds. Active front head restraints that reduce the likelihood of whiplash injuries are newly standard.\n\nEach sedan has standard rear-wheel drive. Luxury models can have 4Matic all-wheel drive and a five-speed-automatic transmission. All V-6 models use a seven-speed automatic, but C230 and C350 sport sedans can be equipped with a six-speed-manual gearbox. An AMG-modified five-speed automatic goes into the C55 AMG.\n\nExterior\nC-Class models gained redesigned clear headlamps and revised taillamps for 2005. By using wider rear wheels and tires, the track width was increased. C280 and C350 models get 16-inch wheels, the C230 sport sedan uses 17-inch wheels, and the C55 AMG rides on 18-inch tires. Bi-xenon headlamps and a moonroof are available.\n\nThe performance-packed C55 AMG has a unique body structure that differentiates it from other C-Class models. The front section has been specially designed to accommodate the V-8 engine. The fenders, hood and grille have been modified, and the front track is wider than usual. Large exhaust pipes give the C55 AMG a distinct sound.\n\nInterior\nC-Class sedans seat five occupants. Sport sedans feature aluminum trim in the cabin. Special AMG Nappa leather seats with Alcantara inserts, gearshift buttons on the steering wheel and an AMG instrument cluster are installed in the C55 AMG. Mercedes-Benz’s Comand and Tele Aid systems are available in all models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour distinct engines are available in C-Class models. Three new twin-cam V-6 engines with four valves per cylinder are available. A 201-hp, 2.5-liter V-6 goes into the C230. The C280 sedan contains a 228-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, while a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 is installed in C350 sedans. Topping the performance spectrum, the C55 AMG gets a 5.5-liter V-8 that produces 362 hp at 5,750 rpm. A six-speed-manual gearbox or seven-speed automatic with Touch Shift operation can be installed in non-AMG sport sedans. All-wheel-drive sedans use a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, Mercedes-Benz’s Electronic Stability Program, and side-impact and side curtain-type airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Despite some dental work last year, the 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is getting long in the tooth, with performance and space concerns that will need a full redesign to address.\n\nMercedes’ rear-drive sport sedan has a slew of competitors, including the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Cadillac ATS. (Compare the group here.) Following a range of 2012 updates that included the addition of a four-seat C-Class coupe, the C-Class gets a more powerful V-6 in the midlevel Mercedes-Benz C-Class C 300 sedan for 2013. Compare the 2013 and 2012 C-Class here.\n\nThe coupe and sedan both offer rear- or all-wheel drive, and variations range from the turbo four-cylinder C250 to the V-8 C63 AMG. We put a rear-drive C250 sedan through its paces on public roads and a racetrack. (See the window sticker here). We also drove a rear-drive C350.\n\nSnug Interior\nSport sedans usually have snug interiors, but the C-Class sedan feels downright miniscule. I needed the driver’s seat all the way back for my 5-foot-11 frame; the center console encroaches on legroom, and headroom runs out if you elevate the seat. In back, adults’ legs touch the front seatbacks, and the low seat cushions elevate passengers’ knees in an uncomfortable way.\n\nCompetitors offer more room up front and better confines in back, and the numbers show it. Passenger volume in the C-Class sedan totals a cramped 88.2 cubic feet. Every major competitor exceeds 90 cubic feet, and the Acura TL and 3 Series top 96 cubic feet. The increase may sound modest, but taller drivers — and their backseat passengers — will appreciate it.\n\nA dashboard redesign for 2012 scuttled some of the C-Class’ dowdiest pieces, but the overall tone is still solemn — even in our test car, whose Dynamic Sport Package added red seat belts and accent stitching on the imitation leather seats. Real leather is optional, but Mercedes’ MB-Tex faux cowhide has a taut, believable quality. Still, the fact that you have to pay extra for real leather in higher trims — even the $60,000-plus C63 — is absurd.\n\nCabin materials are competitive overall, but other details are hit and miss. The gated gearshift still snakes from Park to Drive with satisfying heft, but the chintzy door locks feel cheap. So do the flimsy climate dials and crude sun visors.\n\nDriving Disappointments\nCharacteristic of Mercedes-Benz, the C250’s accelerator has plodding, gradual progression. The C250’s modest output — 201 horsepower from a small turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder — makes matters worse. Takeoffs around town are sluggish even in the automatic transmission’s Sport mode. Hammer the gas and the C250’s 229 pounds-feet of torque lend some midrange oomph, but the drivetrain runs out of steam as the tachometer needle swings to the right. Indeed, our C250 needed 8.2 seconds to hit 60 mph — slowest among the five competitors we tested in a recent Sport Sedan Challenge. An A4, TL and ATS hit the mark in less than 8 seconds; a 328i and Volvo S60 needed less than 7 seconds. (The cars, all automatics, were timed with two adults onboard.)\n\nStep up to the C300 for a 248-hp V-6. For 2013, it added 20 hp and 30 pounds-feet of torque. Saddled with standard 4Matic all-wheel drive, however, the car weighs some 300 pounds more than the C250. Mercedes-Benz quotes similar acceleration times as the C250, but given our own results, I’m skeptical of any additional acceleration.\n\nThe C350’s 302-hp V-6 revs smoothly, with punchy thrust at the high end. Still, it lacks the immediate torque of a BMW 335i or Lexus IS 350, and even its high-rev thrust falls short of Audi’s screaming S4. In regular (Economy) or Sport mode, the transmission resists downshifting until too late. The car feels quick if you manhandle the gas pedal, but it’s a constant game of wake-me-up.\n\nWith a standard seven-speed automatic, EPA fuel economy ranges from 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined in the C250 to 20/29/23 in either the all-wheel-drive C300 or the rear-wheel-drive C350. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class C 250 falls a bit short of the four-cylinder 3 Series and A4, but the C350 compares more favorably to the six-cylinder competition. Mercedes requires premium gas, however; some competitors merely recommend it.\n\nWe haven’t tested the C63 AMG since Mercedes-Benz updated it for 2012. Its V-8 kicks out 451 hp, and an optional performance package raises that to 481 hp.\n\nI can only hope the C63 AMG improves on the standard C-Class’ brakes, which are miserable. In both C-Class sedans we tested, the brake pedal felt spongy and tentative before clamping down. The C250 finished midpack in our 60-mph-to-zero braking tests, but editors agreed pedal feel was as vague as a modern-art exhibit.\n\nThe car’s lackluster handling diminishes things, too. Most C-Class sedans have Luxury or Sport layouts, the latter with a sport-tuned suspension. It does little to contain the C-Class’ body roll, however; our C350 Sport pitched into corners, with vague, disconnected steering that threw too much guesswork into each corner.\n\nOutfitted with the Dynamic Sport Package, which includes what Mercedes-Benz calls an Advanced Agility Suspension, the C250 fared better, but it’s still no champ. Steering and cornering improve a great deal, but the standard electronic stability system cuts power early and often to control pervasive understeer as the nose pushes wide. Turn the electronics off and you can nudge the tail out more easily, but the C-Class never feels as drift-happy as the ATS or 3 Series.\n\nThe payoff comes in ride comfort, which scores in both ride and noise isolation. Even with the sport-tuned suspension — or our C250’s advanced adaptive setup — the C-Class is a comfort-oriented car.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nThe C-Class sedan is a Top Safety Pick for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having earned top marks in front, side and rear impacts, as well as roof-strength tests. The car fared poorly in IIHS’ new small-overlap frontal test, however (read about it here) — a test the TL and S60 aced. The C-Class coupe has not been crash-tested.\n\nStandard safety features on the C-Class include nine airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Optional side-impact torso airbags for the backseat bring the total airbag count to 11. Click here for a full list of safety features. Forward collision alert with automatic braking is optional, as are drowsy-driving detection, lane-keeping and departure warning and mitigation systems, night vision and adaptive headlights.\n\nOverall reliability has been above average, but that isn’t much of a differentiator; the TL, 3 Series and A4 have similar or better marks.\n\nThe C250 sedan starts just over $36,000; the coupe begins close to $39,000. Standard features include 17-inch alloy-wheels, a moonroof, Mercedes’ MB-Tex imitation leather, power front seats, HD radio, USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, steering-wheel audio controls and a 5.8-inch dash display. As usual, Mercedes is stingy with standard features. Some competitors include a folding backseat, leather upholstery, heated seats and keyless access with push-button start as standard equipment; Mercedes-Benz charges extra for all four. Other options on the C-Class include xenon headlights, a 7-inch navigation system, a backup camera, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, a panoramic moonroof and a Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo. Check all the boxes and the C350 approaches $60,000. The C63 AMG, meanwhile, can go well into the six-figure range.\n\nC-Class in the Market\nDespite its age and relative price, the C-Class remains popular. Sales through the first two months of 2012 outpaced all competitors, including the vaunted 3 Series — the best-selling luxury car in eight of the past 10 years. What gives? I suspect two things: One, the C-Class has two body styles and a broad range of engines, which gives shoppers a wider lineup than is available with many C-Class competitors. Two, the car has topped its class in residual values for two years running. That drives down monthly rates for leases, which play a huge roll in luxury-car sales.\n\nThose reasons — or others — may play into your consideration of this baby Benz. Just take a close look at competing sport sedans, too; you may find a lot to like elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Stung by poor reliability in the first year since its redesign, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan is nonetheless an appealing option for sport-sedan shoppers.\n\nVersus the competition: Stunning cabin quality, good performance and elegant styling make the C-Class a solid choice among its rivals. It’s more Mercedes-Benz luxury than sport, but it continues to justify having earned Cars.com’s Best of 2015 award.\n\nThe C-Class comes in myriad variants with all sorts of drivetrains. The C-Class coupe, which skipped 2016, will arrive at dealerships soon as a 2017 model with a redesign along the lines of the sedan. A C-Class convertible also will join the fray. This review covers the sedan.\n\nFor 2016, the C400 sedan is replaced by the quicker C450 AMG, which slots between the base C300 and performance-topping Mercedes-AMG C63 and C63 S. There’s also a new C350e plug-in hybrid. See all the changes from 2015 to 2016 here, or compare the 2016 trim levels here.\n\n4-Matic, which is what Mercedes-Benz calls their all-wheel system, is optional on the C300 and standard on the C450 AMG. It’s unavailable on the C63 and plug-in hybrid models. We evaluated the C450 AMG, to which I’ll devote most of this review, but our review of the 2015 C300 gives a broader overview of the current-generation C-Class.\nExterior & Styling\nThe C450 AMG Sport’s bodywork looks similar to the C300’s Sport Package, save a unique lower bumper finish, split dual tailpipe frames (though there’s still a single pipe behind each) and a single-blade grille that recalls the C63’s single-split-blade design. The C450 also gets black trim around the windows and side mirrors – cosmetic touches you also can get on the C300 as options.\n\nIt’s a good look overall, but then again, so is any C-Class, which Mercedes-Benz redesigned to tasteful, mini-S-Class effect.\nHow It Drives\nThe C300 is surprisingly capable, with a quick-shifting seven-speed automatic and potent torque from its turbocharged four-cylinder engine. We clocked our long-term, all-wheel-drive C300 hitting 60 mph in just 5.95 seconds.\n\nThe C450 AMG, by contrast, is not some tarted-up C400. Its twin-turbo V-6 is an adaptation of last year’s C400, and the output — 362 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque — is up a modest 33 hp and 30 pounds-feet. But the numbers are misleading. I’ve driven the C300 and C400 back-to-back, and I never found a strong case in terms of raw performance to recommend the latter. The C450 changes that. Takeoffs are quick, with a surge around 2,500 rpm, where the C450 enters a smooth, flat torque plateau that heaves you to higher speeds with seamless vigor. Switch its driving modes to their sportiest settings, and the exhaust pops and hisses when you lift off the accelerator. Keeping with Mercedes’ tradition of quietness, the exhaust never gets noisy. But it adds a degree of visceral excitement that the C400 lacked.\n\nThe C450 AMG’s seven-speed automatic transmission can kick down multiple gears at once even in its least-responsive mode, Comfort. In sportier settings, it blips the gas on downshifts for a smoother, sportier transition – as a good stick-shift driver might do.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class C300 has modest handling, but the C450 AMG version elevates the car to legitimate sport-tuned sedan. The steering delivers good feedback, and, if you dial the adaptive suspension into its sportiest modes, the C450 exhibits minimal body roll.\n\nOne editor noticed some squirminess from our test car’s oddly sized Pirelli winter tires – P225/40R19s all around, rather than the wider P235/40R19 front and P255/35R19 rear tires that Mercedes normally pairs with the C450’s 19-inch wheels. Properly sized all-seasons or high-performance summer rubber likely would fix that, but even these winter tires had good dry-weather grip. On switchbacks, sudden steering inputs can bring some initial push, but the nose stays put otherwise. The tail refuses to play around much, despite Mercedes’ claim that the C450’s all-wheel drive defaults two-thirds of its power to the rear. The car just never wants to slide around, even as you feed more gas through a corner. I was able to coax the tail into tentative drifts by lifting off the gas here and there through long sweepers, but the C450 never seems like a natural drifter – especially compared with rivals such as the BMW 3 Series and Cadillac ATS.\n\nOther hardware impresses: The C450’s brakes are good for strong, linear stopping power and confident pedal feel. The adaptive sport suspension, borrowed from the C63, exhibits firmer ride quality than the C300 but maintains good cabin isolation over minor bumps. It’s noticeably firmer in the suspension’s sportier modes, but the comfort-oriented settings give the C450 acceptable road-trip comfort. The car’s optional semi-autonomous driving aids, which amount to full-speed adaptive cruise control with steering assist, keep you centered and spaced properly on the highway. (Even in these situations, you should pay attention to the road. Cars like this aren’t fully autonomous, as the car will remind you if you leave your hands off the steering wheel for too long.)\n\nThe C300 has a fixed suspension with a choice of three firmness levels: standard or, optionally, comfort or sport calibrations. Mercedes-Benz’s adaptive suspension is optional. We’ve driven the non-AMG C-Class with the adaptive setup, as well as the fixed suspension in standard and sport tuning. There isn’t a huge difference between them: The adaptive suspension adds a degree of richness to overall ride quality, but it’s a moderate shift; it does not turn the Mercedes-Benz C-Class into an S-Class.\n\nInterior\nAside from some unique gauges, the C450’s cabin is similar to a C300 Sport. Materials quality is outstanding for the entry-luxury class, with no cheapened-out plastics below eye level as some competitors employ. Still, some larger drivers may find the center console inhibits thigh room and legroom – areas where certain competitors, such as Audi’s redesigned A4, are roomier.\n\nSport seats are standard in the C450, but one editor found them too confining. Power adjustments and vinyl upholstery also are standard; like on the C300, real leather, heated and ventilated seats, and a panoramic moonroof are optional. Options unique to the C450 include an AMG steering wheel and performance seats with even more bolstering.\n\nThe backseat is a little tight, with good headroom but a low seating position, short bottom cushions and a large center hump in the floor. That’s par for the course in this class, but competitors such as the redesigned 2017 Audi A4 buck the trend, as do certain midsize sedans that run in this price range, such as the Lexus ES.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe C-Class’ standard 7-inch multimedia screen employs Mercedes’ Comand knob below a clickable touchpad that can be used to swipe between menus. HD radio, two USB ports, and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming also are standard.\n\nOptional multimedia features include a navigation system that swaps the 7-inch screen for an 8.4-inch display, as well as a head-up display and in-car Wi-Fi (subscription required after the trial period) that enables TuneIn internet radio. Burmester premium audio also is optional, but it’s unexceptional, with muddy bass and little clarity throughout its range. It also has to fight considerable wind noise at highway speeds; as luxury cars go, the C-Class is not particularly quiet.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are not offered.\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk volume is a modest 12.6 cubic feet in most C-Class sedans, but the rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split to open up a large pass-through with no ledges or trailing seat belts in the way. The C350e has a slightly smaller trunk (11.8 cubic feet), and the C63 loses the backseat’s middle pass-through for a simpler 60/40-split folding seat.\nSafety\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class earned top marks in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s side and moderate-overlap frontal crash tests, but it hasn’t undergone IIHS’ roof-strength, small-overlap frontal, or seating and head restraint tests. It earned five stars overall out of a possible five in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing.\n\nStandard safety features for this body type include some nice driver assistance packages, likea forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking that scored five out of six possible points in IIHS’ auto-braking tests – enough to earn the agency’s top grade (superior) for auto-braking. (An optional auto-braking system called Pre-Safe Brake with Pedestrian Recognition applies even stronger brakes than the standard automatic emergency braking; it earned the full six out of six points in IIHS tests.) Other standard safety features include Mercedes-Benz’s Attention Assist system, which senses driver drowsiness on dozens of parameters and alerts you to pull over.\n\nSee a full list of standard safety features here and Cars.com’s Car Seat Check for the 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class here.\n\nOf note, a backup camera — widely standard in cheaper cars — is optional, not standard, in the C-Class. Other safety options include side-impact torso airbags for the rear seats (head-protecting curtain airbags are standard), active headlights, blind spot and lan departure warning systems with lane-keeping steering, and warning systems for frontal vehicular or pedestrian cross-traffic.\nValue in Its Class\nA number of crowd-pleaser luxury features — such as leather, a moonroof and heated seats — are optional rather than standard, and it’s inexcusable that a sedan that starts at almost $40,000 doesn’t have a standard backup camera. So the Mercedes-Benz C-Class isn’t much of a value choice, at least among luxury cars, and the current generation’s poor reliability in its first year on the market doesn’t help the cause. It’s less of a concern if you plan to lease the car, but things that break are inconvenient, even if they’re under warranty.\n\nStill, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class boasts cabin materials that would impress in a $60,000-plus luxury car, and its performance — from capable to fierce, depending on the drivetrain you choose — is impressive. Mercedes-Benz’s 2016 addition, the C450 AMG, adds a credible sport-sedan alternative.\n\nThe good news, thanks to a lot of turbocharging, is that the smaller-engine versions of sport sedans — such as the C300 and rival Lexus IS 200t, BMW 328i and the A4 — all are quick in their own right. It’s a good time to be a sport-sedan shopper, and the redesigned Mercedes-Benz C-Class remains a must-test drive.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDespite some dental work last year, the 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is getting long in the tooth, with performance and space concerns that will need a full redesign to address.\n\nMercedes’ rear-drive sport sedan has a slew of competitors, including the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Cadillac ATS. (Compare the group here.) Following a range of 2012 updates that included the addition of a four-seat C-Class coupe, the C-Class gets a more powerful V-6 in the midlevel C300 sedan for 2013. Compare the 2013 and 2012 C-Class here.\n\nThe coupe and sedan both offer rear- or all-wheel drive, and variations range from the turbo four-cylinder C250 to the V-8 C63 AMG. We put a rear-drive C250 sedan through its paces on public roads and a racetrack. (See the window sticker here). We also drove a rear-drive C350.\n\nSnug Interior\nSport sedans usually have snug interiors, but the C-Class sedan feels downright miniscule. I needed the driver’s seat all the way back for my 5-foot-11 frame; the center console encroaches on legroom, and headroom runs out if you elevate the seat. In back, adults’ legs touch the front seatbacks, and the low seat cushions elevate passengers’ knees in an uncomfortable way.\n\nCompetitors offer more room up front and better confines in back, and the numbers show it. Passenger volume in the C-Class sedan totals a cramped 88.2 cubic feet. Every major competitor exceeds 90 cubic feet, and the Acura TL and 3 Series top 96 cubic feet. The increase may sound modest, but taller drivers — and their backseat passengers — will appreciate it.\n\nA dashboard redesign for 2012 scuttled some of the C-Class’ dowdiest pieces, but the overall tone is still solemn — even in our test car, whose Dynamic Sport Package added red seat belts and accent stitching on the imitation leather seats. Real leather is optional, but Mercedes’ MB-Tex faux cowhide has a taut, believable quality. Still, the fact that you have to pay extra for real leather in higher trims — even the $60,000-plus C63 — is absurd.\n\nCabin materials are competitive overall, but other details are hit and miss. The gated gearshift still snakes from Park to Drive with satisfying heft, but the chintzy door locks feel cheap. So do the flimsy climate dials and crude sun visors.\n\nDriving Disappointments\nCharacteristic of Mercedes, the C250’s accelerator has plodding, gradual progression. The C250’s modest output — 201 horsepower from a small turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder — makes matters worse. Takeoffs around town are sluggish even in the automatic transmission’s Sport mode. Hammer the gas and the C250’s 229 pounds-feet of torque lend some midrange oomph, but the drivetrain runs out of steam as the tachometer needle swings to the right. Indeed, our C250 needed 8.2 seconds to hit 60 mph — slowest among the five competitors we tested in a recent Sport Sedan Challenge. An A4, TL and ATS hit the mark in less than 8 seconds; a 328i and Volvo S60 needed less than 7 seconds. (The cars, all automatics, were timed with two adults onboard.)\n\nStep up to the C300 for a 248-hp V-6. For 2013, it added 20 hp and 30 pounds-feet of torque. Saddled with standard 4Matic all-wheel drive, however, the car weighs some 300 pounds more than the C250. Mercedes quotes similar acceleration times as the C250, but given our own results, I’m skeptical of any additional acceleration.\n\nThe C350’s 302-hp V-6 revs smoothly, with punchy thrust at the high end. Still, it lacks the immediate torque of a BMW 335i or Lexus IS 350, and even its high-rev thrust falls short of Audi’s screaming S4. In regular (Economy) or Sport mode, the transmission resists downshifting until too late. The car feels quick if you manhandle the gas pedal, but it’s a constant game of wake-me-up.\n\nWith a standard seven-speed automatic, EPA gas mileage ranges from 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined in the C250 to 20/29/23 in either the all-wheel-drive C300 or the rear-wheel-drive C350. The C250 falls a bit short of the four-cylinder 3 Series and A4, but the C350 compares more favorably to the six-cylinder competition. Mercedes requires premium gas, however; some competitors merely recommend it.\n\nWe haven’t tested the C63 AMG since Mercedes updated it for 2012. Its V-8 kicks out 451 hp, and an optional performance package raises that to 481 hp.\n\nI can only hope the C63 AMG improves on the standard C-Class’ brakes, which are miserable. In both C-Class sedans we tested, the brake pedal felt spongy and tentative before clamping down. The C250 finished midpack in our 60-mph-to-zero braking tests, but editors agreed pedal feel was as vague as a modern-art exhibit.\n\nThe car’s lackluster handling diminishes things, too. Most C-Class sedans have Luxury or Sport layouts, the latter with a sport-tuned suspension. It does little to contain the C-Class’ body roll, however; our C350 Sport pitched into corners, with vague, disconnected steering that threw too much guesswork into each corner.\n\nOutfitted with the Dynamic Sport Package, which includes what Mercedes calls an Advanced Agility Suspension, the C250 fared better, but it’s still no champ. Steering and cornering improve a great deal, but the standard electronic stability system cuts power early and often to control pervasive understeer as the nose pushes wide. Turn the electronics off and you can nudge the tail out more easily, but the C-Class never feels as drift-happy as the ATS or 3 Series.\n\nThe payoff comes in ride comfort, which scores in both ride and noise isolation. Even with the sport-tuned suspension — or our C250’s advanced adaptive setup — the C-Class is a comfort-oriented car.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nThe C-Class sedan is a Top Safety Pick for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, having earned top marks in front, side and rear impacts, as well as roof-strength tests. The car fared poorly in IIHS’ new small-overlap frontal test, however (read about it here) — a test the TL and S60 aced. The C-Class coupe has not been crash-tested.\n\nStandard safety features on the C-Class include nine airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. Optional side-impact torso airbags for the backseat bring the total airbag count to 11. Click here for a full list of safety features. Forward collision alert with automatic braking is optional, as are drowsy-driving detection, lane departure warning and mitigation systems, night vision and adaptive headlights.\n\nOverall reliability has been above average, but that isn’t much of a differentiator; the TL, 3 Series and A4 have similar or better marks.\n\nThe C250 sedan starts just over $36,000; the coupe begins close to $39,000. Standard features include 17-inch wheels, a moonroof, Mercedes’ MB-Tex imitation leather, power front seats, HD radio, USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, steering-wheel audio controls and a 5.8-inch dash display. As usual, Mercedes is stingy with standard features. Some competitors include a folding backseat, leather upholstery, heated seats and keyless access with push-button start as standard equipment; Mercedes charges extra for all four. Other options on the C-Class include xenon headlights, a 7-inch navigation system, a backup camera, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, a panoramic moonroof and a Harman Kardon surround-sound stereo. Check all the boxes and the C350 approaches $60,000. The C63 AMG, meanwhile, can go well into the six-figure range.\n\nC-Class in the Market\nDespite its age and relative price, the C-Class remains popular. Sales through the first two months of 2012 outpaced all competitors, including the vaunted 3 Series — the best-selling luxury car in eight of the past 10 years. What gives? I suspect two things: One, the C-Class has two body styles and a broad range of engines, which gives shoppers a wider lineup than is available with many C-Class competitors. Two, the car has topped its class in residual values for two years running. That drives down monthly rates for leases, which play a huge roll in luxury-car sales.\n\nThose reasons — or others — may play into your consideration of this baby Benz. Just take a close look at competing sport sedans, too; you may find a lot to like elsewhere.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "It’s probably not shocking to learn that I fell in love with the 2012 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but what may be surprising is it worked for my family.\n\nThe 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250 combined everything I love in one package, too: a coveted driving experience, good looks and enough room for my favorite people.\n\nI can’t see Mercedes-Benz marketing its sexy sedan as a mom-mobile, but this car felt like it was designed with a woman in mind. During my weeklong test drive, I marveled over the ergonomics, the ease of operation and even the dimensions inside and outside the vehicle; once I saddled into the C250 things felt just right. It wasn’t so small that I felt unsafe in it, but it wasn’t too big for me to handle with complete control and confidence, which made it the perfect size.\n\nAs to be expected, the C250 offers a firm ride with acute responsiveness and tight handling. With my test car’s Sport trim, things got very, ahem, fun on the road. It was such a dynamic driving experience that it’s almost strange to think of the C-Class as a sedan. With its turbocharged four-cylinder engine, the C250 has just enough power to make you feel bold behind the wheel, but not so much that you’ll feel like a reckless teenager with kids in the backseat.\n\nDespite its luxury sedan status, I was also surprised to see how competitively it was priced. A 2012 C250 Sport sedan starts at $34,800. However, my test car, a C250 Sport model with both the Premium and Multimedia packages, cost significantly more at $44,860.\n\nEXTERIOR\nRight off the bat, the C250’s looks won me over. From the outside, the C-Class looks petite without coming across as small; it’s sporty but sophisticated, and even with four doors, it’s anything but boring. With its Mars Red exterior paint color, my test car just looked too glam for words. It was practically my favorite tube of Chanel lipstick on wheels.\n\nThanks to the sedan’s low-step-in height, the kids should be able to enter and exit the car independently without problems. For kiddos who need to be strapped into child-safety seats, the door openings are wide open enough to get them into the backseat and situated with ease. Taller parents, watch your head! It’s easy to hit your head on the door openings when helping little ones, but if you love the looks of the C250 as much as I did, it’s something you’ll learn to live with.\n\nFor a compact sedan, the C250’s cargo area is quite large. It swallowed my stroller and yoga mat with room to spare, but a double-stroller would probably be pushing it. The 60/40-split folding backseat creates more cargo room should you need it.\n\nThe 2012 C250 has a 201-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. The C250 gets an EPA-estimated 21/31 mpg city/highway. I averaged 22 mpg for the week, with primarily city driving. I found it to be reasonable considering the turbo engine, but it still hurt to have to fill up with premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than Fair, less than Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nI expected the C-Class’ interior to be snug and too small a fit for my family, but after my husband strapped into the front passenger seat with the baby’s rear-facing child-safety seat behind him in the backseat and didn’t find his knees in the dash, things were off to a great start.\n\nI can’t say the inside of a C250 is roomy, but it’s far more comfortable than you might think for such a sporty little sedan. You may not want to put your basketball-playing teenager in the backseat for too long, but there is a fair amount of legroom for most passengers.\n\nThe seats in the C-Class are some of the most comfortable I’ve sat in. There’s just something about the way the seat bolsters hug you, and with the eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, you’re guaranteed to find your own sweet spot. The C250 is a five-seater, but realistically, I can’t imagine more than two passengers fitting comfortably in the backseat.\n\nAs for cupholders, there’s your standard two in the front row and two in the backseat. There is also a small storage bin under the front-row armrest that can easily hold a wallet or sunglasses, and there are pockets on the seatbacks of both the driver and front passenger seats. I was disappointed when I couldn’t stash a water bottle in the cutout in the door, but you don’t want a car like the C250 getting too cluttered with junk.\n\nI loved the optional panoramic moonroof in my test car and the luxurious trim finishes in the interior, but what I did find disappointing were the ancient-looking displays found on the optional Comand system’s 7-inch high-resolution color screen. The system’s knob controller is easy to use, but with as expensive as everything else appears inside the C-Class, the displays look old and out of place.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests to earn this safety nod. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has only conducted a rollover crash test on the C-Class. It received a score of four stars out of five.\n\nThe C250 comes standard with rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, and frontal-, side-impact and side curtain airbags. It also has a standard driver’s knee airbag and a drowsiness monitor, Attention Assist, which flashes a coffee cup icon when the car senses you’re too tired to drive.\n\nOptional safety features include a backup camera, mbrace emergency communication system, and blind spot warning and lane departure assist systems, which alert the driver when the car drifts out of its lane. How’s that for looking out for you?\n\nAlthough my rear-facing child-safety seat fit just fine in the backseat, I wish the C250’s lower Latch anchors were a little easier to access. The hardware matched the Mars Red exterior paint color, making them easy to identify, but they were buried under the stiff seat cushions. Once I was able to access them, the car-seat installation went smoothly, but I wish the C250 featured Latch anchors that sit out in the open with rubber flip-up covers like I’ve seen in its more luxurious sibling, the CLS-Class.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 C-Class sedan here.",

      "expert_review": "With its C-Class sports coupe models, Mercedes-Benz seeks to attract a younger buyer.\n\nThat is, younger buyers who want to pay less for their Mercedes and have it come with a bit more style.\n\nThe first hint of something different comes when you look at the window sticker. The four-cylinder C230 sports coupe starts at $25,615, including destination, making it the cheapest Mercedes sold in the United States. A second version of this coupe, the V-6 C320, was added to the lineup a few months ago. It retails for $27,965, including destination.\n\nThe second thing that’s apparent is that Mercedes is now willing to let its designers take a bit of a risk.\n\nHow else to explain this coupe with its controversial rear end? There’s a clear panel between the tail lights and under the rear spoiler. Mercedes says it helps a driver’s rear visibility, but it gives the C coupe something of an oddball look. Pontiac’s Aztek, this generation’s Edsel, does something similar, although Mercedes’ treatment is thankfully handled more deftly.\n\nWhile we’re throwing around insults, the side of the C coupe is a bit swoopy, reminding me of its American cousin, the Dodge Neon. (DaimlerChrysler owns both Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and America’s Chrysler brands, including Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler.)\n\nHowever, the car’s front end is all Mercedes-Benz, with its snowman-shaped lights and pronounced grille complete with the three-point star.\n\nOverall, I find the look sporty if not altogether appealing. It’s not as formal as other Mercedes models, but it’s more fun.\n\nWhile the C230 model gets the super-charged 1.8-liter four-cylinder that also appears in the SLK230, the C320 gets the 3.2-liter V-6 that appears in other Mercedes models as well as the new Chrysler Crossfire coupe.\n\nOur test car was the C320 equipped with the five-speed automatic transmission. Buyers also can select a six-speed manual. With 215 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque, this V-6-equipped coupe was fast, if not speedy.\n\nOn the road, the C320 coupe has a solid feel that’s more sort-of sporty than serious sports car. The automatic transmission is excellent, although the six-speed manual would be my preferred choice based on both my driving style (I like shifting) and my wallet (it’s $1,325 cheaper).\n\nTo keep the price down, Mercedes offers cloth seats on the C coupe. Our test model had the optional ($1,440) leather chairs. The stereo offers AM/FM and a cassette player, but not a CD player.\n\nMuch safety equipment is standard, including front and side air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes as well as Mercedes’ electronic stability program (ESP) that relies on sensors and brakes to keep the car on its path, especially when making turns on ice, snow and gravel.\n\nInside, the C320 felt much like other C-Class models, including the sedans and wagons. Aluminum trim gives the cabin a bit of a luxury feel. The dash board was laid out so that a driver could find things intuitively without resorting to the confusing array of buttons found in the more expensive S-Class vehicles.\n\nThe front seats were stiff but comfortable. This is a great car for two people as the back seat, while not difficult to enter or exit, just isn’t roomy enough for most adults. I’m 6-foot-1, and my head brushed the ceiling.\n\nWith everyone from Toyota and Honda to Dodge and Ford looking for younger buyers, it’s not surprising that Mercedes-Benz is making an effort, too, with more affordable models like the C coupes.\n\nAnd, both versions of the C-Class coupe have a more true-to-the-marque feel than BMW’s 318ti that arrived in the United States in 1995 and didn’t last long on the market.\n\nThe Mercedes C coupes compete against the more-expensive BMW 3-Series coupes, the very-nice Infiniti G35 coupe and Acura’s soon-to-depart CL.\n\nTEN-SECOND TEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Mercedes-Benz C32 Sports Coupe\n\nPrice: $31,440\n\nStars:**** (hstr)\n\nWhy we’d buy it: Affordable German technology; nice V-6\n\nWhy we wouldn’t: Odd rear-end styling",

      "expert_review": "MERCEDES’ LINE GETS NEW LOOK AND FEATURES\n\nIn the duke-it-out near-luxe segment of the car business, Mercedes-Benz has reloaded for the 2005 model year.\n\nThat means the C-Class sedans, coupes and wagon get a new look and new features. They went on sale earlier this summer.\n\n“The competitive landscape is tough,” Bart Herring, C-Class product manager for Mercedes-Benz USA, said recently in San Jose. “We have to have something to talk about every year.”\n\nOh, and how’s a $54,000 C-Class sedan with a 368-horsepower V-8 engine for something to talk about?\n\nBut while the C55 AMG that arrived last month is for a select few — Mercedes says it’ll sell about 1,200 of them during the second half of this year — the raison d’être of the C-Class is to attract first-time buyers to Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThat’s why the cheapest 2005 C-Class sedan, the C230 Sport sedan, starts at $29,250.\n\nAnd the C240 wagon starts at $34,150.\n\nAnd the C230 Kompressor coupe is the cheapest one of all, starting at $25,850.\n\n“It’s a great time to buy a car in that segment,” Herring said. Longtime favorites such as the BMW 3-Series, Audi A4 and Lexus ES 300 have been joined by newcomers such as the Infiniti G35, Acura TL and Chrysler 300C.\n\nThe result? More competition and stable prices.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s U.S. sales have grown tremendously in the past decade, from 61,899 in 1993 to 218,117 in 2003. And the C-Class has been a primary factor of that sales success, as its sales have grown from about 15,000 units a year in the early ’90s to more than 60,000 units in 2002 and 2003.\n\n“It’s been outstanding if you consider where we are in the life cycle,” Herring said.\n\nThis generation of C-Class arrived in September 2000 as a 2001 model. But, according to Herring, it was the January 2003 introduction of C-Class Sport models that really turned heads.\n\nBefore that, C-Class cars were cheaper, smaller versions of the E- and S-Class models — cars known for their engineering, festooned in wood and leather and equipped with automatic transmissions.\n\nThose cars still exist, and they still attract about half of the C-Class buyers. Mercedes identifies them as “luxury” models, but doesn’t give them badges that say that. “This is a customer we know well,” he said.\n\nBut, with the Sport models — which do get “Sport” badges — and the changes in them for the 2005 model year, the appeal has now shifted to what Herring describes as driving enthusiasts.\n\n“This is the customer who wants a little bit stronger driving dynamics, sportier feel, more aggressive styling,” he said.\n\nThe 2005 C-Class Sport sedans — the C230 Sport ($29,250) and the C320 Sport ($37,350) — borrow exterior styling from the C32 AMG car that ends production this year. They come with lowered and specially tuned suspensions, bigger drilled and ventilated brakes, 17-inch all oy wheels and high-performance tires. On the inside, the Sport models have special three-spoke steering wheels, aluminum pedals, aluminum trim and chrome gauge rings, bolstered sport seats and six-speed manual transmissions.\n\nThe Sport and luxury models are different enough that they “polarize” customers, and that’s just what Mercedes wants, Herring said. This year, they even produced different product brochures for Sport and luxury C-Class buyers.\n\nAnd, as everyone from Saturn (Red Line) and Cadillac (V-Series) to Acura (A-Spec) have joined the game where BMW and Mercedes have long played with their M and AMG models, sportiness is “in.”\n\nAnd, while the Sport models add a bit of performance feel to the C-Class lineup, nothing will compare to the C55 AMG. It’s a super sedan featuring a hand-built 5.5-liter V-8 that makes 362 horsepower.\n\nIts styling, from the windshield forward, is borrowed from the CLK55 AMG model, Herring said. In fact, AMG enginee s had to lengthen the C-Class chassis by 80 millimeters to fit in the V-8 engine.\n\nPriced at $53,900, it went on sale last month.\n\nIn other C-Class news:\n\n* Wagons. The C240 wagon ($34,150) is now the only wagon in the lineup because the C320 wagon has been dropped. The interest in wagons seems to be growing, Herring said, but sales “still are not performing the way we all thought it would.”\n\n* All-wheel drive. Available on C-Class luxury sedans and wagons, the Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is a full-time system that doesn’t require any driver action to activate. It costs $1,200 as part of an option package that includes heated front seats.\n\n* Coupe. The two C-Class coupes — the C230 Kompressor ($25,850) and the C320 ($28,250) — get all the changes made to the other C-Class models including a new dashboard with a four-gauge instrument cluster, new seats and chrome trim.",

      "expert_review": "The previous Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe, last sold as a 2015 model, wasn’t much to look at. It was nice but it didn’t light any driving enthusiasts’ hearts on fire. It didn’t inspire more than a passing glance as it rolled past and it didn’t get noticed among luxury coupe buyers, either. To listen to Mercedes-Benz marketing people tell it, even they saw it as something of a compromised model: It had no all-wheel-drive option and its styling wasn’t as racy as some competitors.\n\nAll that has changed for 2017 with the introduction of the second-generation C-Class coupe, starting with the C300 4Matic trim appearing in showrooms now. Compare 2017 and 2015 model years here.\n\nThe new Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe gets a significant injection of style, technology and performance, as the two-door version follows the four-door, which won our Best of 2015 award. The new coupe is longer and wider than the car it replaces, which pays dividends in ride quality, interior space and handling refinement. From top to bottom, the new C-Class coupe looks and feels like a totally different animal from its predecessor — and a significant leap ahead of luxury coupe competitors. The C-Class is smaller than the similarly-styled E-Class.\n\nStyling and Exterior\n\nIt starts with the exterior styling, which is considerably different from the sedan. The strongest resemblance to the four-door is up front, where the headlights and grille look similar, but the coupe gets one horizontal strake versus the sedan’s two. From there rearward, the two look nothing alike; the coupe more closely resembles the S-Class coupe and the AMG GT S coupe.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe features a character line from the headlights all the way down the shoulder to the taillights, while the sedan’s line stops at the rear doors. The coupe’s roof is lower, with smaller windows all around leading to a small rear window and high taillights that have a distinctly more horizontal attitude than the sedan’s. The C-Class coupe isn’t wedge-shaped — it’s more of a lozenge shape, sloped and tapered at both ends — but it’s dramatic and distinctive in person. There isn’t a bad angle from which to view this car and it turns heads regardless of what color it’s painted.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe will first appear in C300 guise, featuring a turbocharged, 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine making 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission that shunts power either to the rear wheels or to all four if you opt for 4Matic all-wheel drive. Mercedes says the combination is good for a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.9 seconds and a rolling, full-throttle run or two makes this seem like a reasonable claim.\n\nFoot to the floor, the car feels quick off the line but not fast — it runs out of steam at higher rpm, tuned as it is for better low- to mid-range response. Around town, however, the combination is dynamite, making the C300 feel sprightly and agile, especially in Sport or Sport Plus mode. Those are two of five Dynamic Select modes that change several aspects of the car’s performance parameters, such as power-steering assist, shift timing, throttle response and more.\n\nOne thing the C300 coupe never is? Uncomfortable — even in the sportiest setting, Sport Plus. That mode firms up the optional Airmatic air suspension to its stiffest setting, which isn’t harsh — or, frankly, all that sporty. Ride quality is outstanding with the air suspension; it’s a wholly worthwhile option for $1,190 that brings a big-car feel to the small coupe’s body motions.\n\nThe C300 is composed and calm even over broken pavement and frost heaves in Sport+ mode, and even more serene in Comfort mode. The result of that comfort is a body that rolls more than you might expect in corners but this is clearly a grand touring coupe, not a sports car. It never loses sight of its mission, leaving the more extreme sports-coupe abilities to the upcoming C43 AMG and C63 AMG coupes due later this year.\n\nThat’s not to say, however, that it’s a marshmallow. The overall impression you get from the C300 is one of big-car sophistication in a compact package. You feel the suspension working, absorbing bumps and making corrections, but little of that work is transmitted to the car’s occupants. The steering is well-boosted but not sloppy or imprecise. One can hustle the C300 coupe through twisty roads with entertaining ease and minimal effort. It’s just that if you want a more athletic experience, you’ll want to wait for the more potent versions coming down the pipeline.\n\nThe C300 benefits from decent fuel economy, achieving a rating of 23/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive. That’s about even with the Cadillac ATS 2.0T AWD’s 22/30/25 mpg despite the Caddy having an extra gear. It’s better than the six-cylinder Lexus RC 300 AWD coupe’s 19/26/21 mpg but it’s soundly bested by the highway mileage of the BMW 428i xDrive, which is rated 22/34/26 mpg. The Bimmer features one more gear in its transmission than the Benz and while that doesn’t seem to help the lighter Cadillac, it does indeed help the BMW.\n\nInterior\n\n\nInside, the C300 coupe is extremely impressive, just like its sedan sibling. I tested two versions, both of which featured optional full leather upholstery. Just like the C-Class sedan, the coupe’s interior appointments blow away competitors, feeling a price class or two above the one in which it plays.\n\nOther coupes, such as the BMW 4 Series, Lexus RC, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q60 and Audi A5, feel like premium vehicles, but the C300 can feel like a true luxury car. Like the C-Class sedan, the coupe qualifies as a baby S-Class. There isn’t a single part or panel in the interior that isn’t padded, nicely trimmed, real metal, glossy wood or piano black lacquer. The optional colored leather, in either brown or red, truly sets off the interior against the dark charcoal trim. The only potential interior issue may be how some taller folks fit; if you’re long of torso, your head will brush against the low ceiling, which is made lower by the presence of a standard moonroof. This isn’t generally a problem in taller sedans but it’s not uncommon in the compact coupe class.\n\nFront-seat comfort is top-notch but the rear seats are cramped and confined in height, width and legroom. The swoopy styling and short windows that make the C300 coupe such a looker on the outside not only serve to create some blind spots to the rear and sides of the coupe, they also envelope backseat passengers in a cave of dark plastic trim. Like any compact luxury coupe bought more for style than practicality, the backseat is best left for emergencies and children.\n\nElectronics and Ergonomics\n\n\nEvery switch and knob in the coupe moves with a precision and heft that makes it feel expensive. All the controls are within easy reach, including the selector knob for the multimedia system, which resides in the center console. The C300 coupe features Mercedes’ Comand system; unfortunately, neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto are available yet, and they aren’t likely to appear for at least a year and a half, Mercedes says.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n\nBeing a compact coupe, trunk space isn’t this car’s forté, but the C300 features a competitive amount at 10.5 cubic feet. That’s just about even with the 10.4 cubic feet featured in the Cadillac ATS and Lexus RC coupes. It’s also expandable, thanks to a split, folding backseat. The Benz falls well short of rival BMW, however, which lists the 4 Series’ trunk space at a rather suspect 15.7 cubic feet. Given that measuring cargo capacity is something of a pseudo-science among automakers, suffice it to say that the C300 coupe is no better or worse in this department than its rivals.\n\nSafety\n\n\nAs of publication, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe was too new to have been crash-tested. Should test results be published, they’ll appear here.\n\nIn a departure from previous years (and even other current Mercedes), the new C300 coupe features standard forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. In keeping with German luxury car tradition, however, just about every other electronic safety feature remains optional, such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure prevention, blind spot warning, a 360-degree overview camera with park assist sensors, and more. See the C300’s standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nThe starting price for the new C300 coupe is $43,575 including destination, or $45,575 for the all-wheel-drive 4Matic model, though you’ll never find one in stock for those relatively low prices. Add optional items that have become necessities, such as keyless access, a backup camera and the adjustable suspension, and you’re looking at the mid-$50,000 range, maxing out north of $60,000. The as-tested price for the lovely Brilliant Blue coupe I drove came to $56,355, including items like the Premium 2 Package (including blind spot warning, satellite radio, navigation, power-folding mirrors, a power trunk and adjustable ambient lighting), an air suspension, a Sport Package with more aggressive styling, perforated brake rotors and a flat-bottom steering wheel.\n\nEvery luxury brand worth its salt has a compact coupe, so choosing among competitors isn’t easy. The one that’s most often on shopping lists is the BMW 428i, which is available with rear- or all-wheel drive. The BMW also features a turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine and all the same kinds of electronic bells and whistles as the C300 but its baseline mission is more sporty than the Mercedes-Benz, which is more a luxury tourer than a sports coupe.\n\nThe Americans have offered up the sweet-handling Cadillac ATS 2.0T AWD coupe, which beats the Mercedes-Benz in terms of power and torque and is more a rival for the BMW when it comes to handling prowess. But an interior that can’t hold a candle to the C300’s tactile quality and luxurious appointments keeps it behind the curve.\n\nThe same can be said for the Lexus RC 300, which is the lowest trim model that can be had with all-wheel drive (the RC 200t, with its turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine, is rear-drive only). It features styling that’s most kindly described as “polarizing” and a multimedia system controller that’s most accurately described as “garbage.” Its 3.5-liter V-6 makes less torque than any of the turbocharged four-cylinders mentioned above and it’s more than 250 pounds heavier than the Benz, to boot.\n\nAll these coupes start in the low-to-mid $40,000 range and go significantly higher when you start loading on options (compare them for yourself here). The biggest difference between the Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe and competitors that cost just about the same, though, is that the Mercedes actually feels like it’s worth that much money.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is no all-out sport sedan, but it’s one hell of an appealing luxury car.\n\nIf you want a taste of the good life without eviscerating the kids’ college fund, entry-luxury cars like the C-Class have answered that kind of call for more than two decades. Or not: The outgoing C-Class sedan sputtered into last place in 2013’s $46,000 Sport Sedan Challenge (read it here). That was a turbocharged four-cylinder C250 Sport, and we drove a V6-powered C350 soon after that didn’t redeem much. If this is the baby Benz, a lot of bathwater needed draining.\n\nDrain it, Mercedes did.\n\nWith the CLA-Class now anchoring the bottom of the lineup, Mercedes moved the redesigned C-Class upmarket in terms of both quality and price. The redesign hits dealerships late this month in all-wheel-drive C300/C400 form, and in early 2015 in rear-wheel-drive C300 form. From luxury to technology, it’s eminently more desirable than the car it replaces.\n\nI drove the all-wheel-drive (4Matic) C300 and C400 sedans, both with Sport packages. The C-Class coupe soldiers on in prior-gen form for 2015, but company officials said to expect a coupe replacement within a year or so. Oh, and yes, there will be a high-performance AMG version.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMercedes-Benz has a habit of tailoring successive generations of the C-Class after the latest flagship S-Class, and the new C-Class follows that mold even more than usual. The sinewy headlights and curvaceous lower grille signal a clear resemblance to the brand’s top-flight sedan, which Mercedes redesigned just a year ago. The C-Class is now a little closer in size, too: Overall length is up 3.7 inches versus the outgoing sedan, and width is up 1.6 inches.\n\nDespite the extra size, overall weight is down as much as 200 pounds versus the old C-Class sedan thanks to a chassis that mixes aluminum and steel versus the all-steel chassis in the outgoing car. Officials say much of the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class’ body panels — including the hood, doors, roof and trunk — are aluminum, too.\n\nHow It Drives\nFire up the C300’s 241-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, and this year’s extra standard power is immediately noticeable. The engine has little in common with the outgoing C250’s 201-hp, turbo 1.8-liter four-cylinder. It has a flat torque curve — 273 pounds-feet that plateaus from just 1,300 rpm on up — that evokes the BMW 3 Series 328i’s excellent turbo four-cylinder. Where the 2014 C250 ran out of steam, the new C300 moves out. Accelerator progression has improved versus the prior car’s sleepy pedal, and the standard seven-speed automatic kicks down readily with little gear hunting, particularly in the drivetrain’s Sport and Sport Plus modes. You control all that through an Agility Select switch, which also adjusts steering assist, accelerator progression and (in Eco mode) climate control intensity in one convenient toggle.\n\nWith the optional Airmatic adaptive air suspension — a first for the C-Class — Agility Select also changes suspension damping. In the all-wheel-drive, Airmatic-equipped C400 I drove, the system’s various modes dialed up subtle but noticeable differences in ride comfort. Still, the C-Class lacks the all-consuming isolation that characterizes other Airmatic-equipped Benzes. Ride composure was good over rapid dips and rises on my drive, but Airmatic allowed pockmarked highways to send up a degree of cabin disturbance that was little different from my time in a fixed-suspension C300 Sport; the 1-inch-larger wheels in the Airmatic car (19s) shouldn’t be enough to offset the system’s ride-control capabilities. There are also fixed (non-Airmatic) base and Comfort suspensions, as well as cushier 17-inch wheels and higher-profile tires, across the lineup. All those will affect ride quality, so test-drive one and decide for yourself. My take? Airmatic, a stand-alone option on the C300 and C400, isn’t worth its $1,190 price.\n\nMercedes-Benz expects fewer than 20 percent of C-Class buyers to opt for the C400, and it’s easy to see why. It’s a capable car whose turbo, 3.0-liter V-6 makes a stout 329 hp, and the wall-o’-torque (354 pounds-feet from just 1,600 rpm) crests early to send you flying past slower traffic with half the pedal to go. But it’s unnecessary; the C300 does this in a pinch, too, albeit with less power in reserve.\n\nIt handles better, too. Though Mercedes-Benz claims just a 2 percent difference in weight distribution between the C300 and C400, the latter feels more nose-heavy, with a touch more sloppiness up front in sweeping corners. Flip the Agility Select to Sport Plus, and the Airmatic seems to quell body roll better than even the sport-tuned fixed suspension, which pitches off-center a bit as you throw it around. But the C-Class is still no 3 Series or Cadillac ATS; the tail was loathe to drift in my all-wheel-drive test cars, and the sole rear-driver of the lineup — the non-4Matic C300, available in 2015 — doesn’t come with the bigger engine.\n\nBrake-pedal feel, at least, improves a lot versus the outgoing C-Class’ mushy pedal. And both the C300 and C400 steer with a light touch, even in Sport Plus mode. The wheel feels precise enough as you dial into a corner, but overall feedback has a degree of numbness at just about every speed. It keeps with today’s luxury cars, but it will limit the C-Class’ appeal to driving enthusiasts.\n\nInterior\nIf luxury enthusiasts exist, the C-Class will get their trophy. Real wood and metal adorn a cabin that sports first-rate materials from the dashboard to the doors. Anywhere your arms, elbows or knees touch has padding, with available stitched MB-Tex vinyl on areas of the dash and upper doors. Consistent, low-gloss materials are virtually everywhere — a level of quality you don’t often find in this class.\n\nMy C300 and C400 had comfortable sport seats, save for their smallish lower cushions. Non-sport seats with lower side bolsters are also available. MB-Tex vinyl seats are standard; leather seats are optional. Alas, the backseat still sits low to the floor — an issue in the previous C-Class, too — without a lot of payoff in headroom. Despite claimed improvement in backseat space, legroom for adults remains only adequate.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume in the new C-Class is a competitive 12.8 cubic feet, which is up slightly versus the outgoing C-Class (12.4 cubic feet). A new (and standard) 40/20/40-split folding rear seat replaces last year’s 60/40-split seat, and it’s remarkably well-executed.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMercedes’ Comand system, with a 7- or 8.4-inch screen, is controlled by a rotary knob and a new touchpad. You can spin and click through submenus if swiping on a touchpad isn’t your thing.\n\nStandard audio includes Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, HD radio and USB/iPod integration. Mercedes-Benz packages satellite radio with a Burmester stereo, which is optional in the C300 and standard in the C400. The Burmester is pretty darn good.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class had not been crash-tested. Standard safety features include seven airbags plus the required antilock brakes and stability system. A drowsy-driver detection system and forward-collision warning system with automatic braking are also standard. That’s rare, even among luxury cars. Alas, a backup camera — standard on cars as plebian as the Honda Fit — is optional.\n\nRear torso airbags are also optional, which brings the total airbag count to nine. (Head-protecting curtain airbags for front and backseat occupants are standard.) Adaptive cruise control with full-stop braking and steering support, which can nudge the wheel left or right to stay in your lane, is part of a $2,800 Driver Assistance Package, which also includes blind spot, cross traffic and lane departure warning systems. It also adds a lane-keeping system that applies selective brakes (not the steering support) to correct your course if you start to drift. It won’t intervene if you have a turn signal on, and should you need to swerve, you can overcome it easily with steering effort.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe all-wheel-drive C400 gets an EPA-estimated 22/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined, which is decent fuel economy for the six-cylinder competition, but EPA figures are pending for the more popular C300. Mercedes says it expects forward movement on EPA figures, which would suggest better ratings than the current C250/C300, which are as high as 25 mpg combined.\n\nThe outgoing Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan base price started at $36,725 for a rear-drive C250 Sport, including destination. Mercedes says it has no plans to reprise that trim, making the C300 the new base. Rear-drive models will start at $39,325 when they go on sale in early 2015. The extra power and newly standard forward collision warning justifies much of the increase. Other convenience features incur the usual shuffle: A memory driver’s seat and power tilt/telescope steering column move to the standard equipment list, while last year’s moonroof moves to the options list.\n\nA loaded C400 retail price should top out around $65,000, which is a modest increase over the current C350. I suspect shoppers will accept it. Even with the CLA-Class on sale, the Mercedes C-Class topped 33,000 sales through the first six months of 2014. That makes it the second most popular Benz and fifth most popular U.S. luxury nameplate. Outside the U.S., it’s the brand’s best-selling car, according to Mercedes. This 2015 redesign should help it stay there — and also move up a few rungs among U.S. luxury shoppers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benz’s smallest, lowest-priced sedan earned some enhancements for 2003, including newly available 4Matic four-wheel drive that is an alternative to standard rear-wheel drive. A C320 sport wagon joined the C-Class lineup for the 2002 model year, and a C240 wagon followed later. A C32 AMG sedan that is equipped with a 349-horsepower V-6 engine and AMG’s SpeedShift transmission is also available.\n\nSport versions of the C-Class that target younger buyers joined the group during 2003. The C230 Kompressor (supercharged) four-cylinder sport sedan and the C320 sport sedan have a sport-tuned suspension and a standard six-speed close-ratio manual transmission. The 2004 4Matic sedans and wagons with heated seats are priced lower than last year’s models. (Skip to details on the: C-Class Sports Coupe)\n\nExterior\nWedge-shaped styling features a steep rake to the windshield and back window. A familiar Mercedes-Benz grille with a three-pointed star insignia atop the sculpted hood sits up front. The headlights and turn signals are integrated into elliptical shapes, and triangular taillights are installed.\n\nAt 178.3 inches long overall, the C-Class sedan is 2 inches longer than the comparable BMW 3 Series. The high-performance C32 AMG rides on 17-inch tires, while regular C-Class sedans and wagons feature 16-inchers.\n\nInterior\nFive people may revel in a sizable wood-trimmed interior with leather and vinyl upholstery; full leather is available. Powered front seats have ample rearward travel to accommodate tall occupants. Split, folding rear seatbacks are optional. The sedan’s trunk capacity is 12.2 cubic feet, and wagons hold 25.2 cubic feet behind the rear seat. Tele Aid emergency communication service is standard.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 168-hp, 2.6-liter V-6 engine in the C240 teams with a six-speed-manual gearbox or an optional five-speed driver-adaptive automatic transmission. A SpeedShift feature can determine the best possible gear. The 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 in the C320 mates only with the automatic transmission. A supercharged 3.2-liter V-6 in the C32 AMG produces 349 hp and teams with the automatic. A 189-hp supercharged four-cylinder engine goes into the C230 Kompressor model.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags and door-mounted side-impact airbags for the front and rear seats are standard. Curtain-type airbags deploy from above the side windows. With Mercedes-Benz’s BabySmart technology, sensors disable the airbags if they detect a child-safety seat. All C-Class sedans have antilock brakes and the automaker’s Electronic Stability Program.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe C320 is a precise, fully capable and rewarding road machine with a couple of irritating features. Rather than a full set of gauges, the driver must click through a sequence of electronic displays. The tachometer is small, and the controls aren’t the easiest to use. Ride quality is firm but highly pleasing. If the sedan hits a nasty bump, recovery is nearly instantaneous. The C320 is notably stable on the highway, and it requires minimal correction on straightaways. Extra-precise steering provides response to driver inputs that could hardly be better in a family-size sedan; however, the C320 doesn’t feel quite as sure of itself on the road as some rivals.\n\nPerformance from the 3.2-liter engine is strong and eager. The automatic transmission reacts quickly and almost seamlessly for passing and merging. Front occupants get plenty of space.\n\nRelated Model: C-Class Sports Coupe\nA new three-spoke sport steering wheel, an enlarged chrome exhaust tip and body-colored door handles go into 2004 models of the C-Class Sports Coupe. Satellite radio systems can now be installed at the dealership.\n\nNo sheet metal is shared between the C-Class Sports Coupe and the sedan. At 171 inches long overall, the wedge-shaped two-door is 7.3 inches shorter than the sedan, but other dimensions are similar. A sport-tuned suspension helps deliver a more enthusiast-oriented experience.\n\nThe C230’s supercharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine develops 189 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque. A 3.2-liter V-6 in the C320 produces 215 hp and 221 pounds-feet. A six-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a five-speed automatic is optional.\n\nExcept for a slight floating sensation on certain surfaces, the C230 Sports Coupe exhibits expert handling skills. It dives into tight curves with glee and behaves admirably even when the pavement gets rough. Even though the back end occasionally seems like it’s on the verge of breaking loose during rapid maneuvers, the Coupe remains quite well planted.\n\nWhen equipped with an automatic transmission, the Coupe lacks the zip and personality that the well-matched six-speed manual provides. Acceleration is suitably swift, and the supercharger’s presence is hardly noticeable in ordinary driving. The manual gearbox shifts easily with short throws between gears, but it is slightly vague.
