      "expert_review": "Monterey Car Week in California is likely the nation’s largest gathering of moneyed car geeks — an appropriate venue, then, to debut a new luxury sports car. Mercedes-AMG, the fabled German automaker’s in-house performance arm, took advantage of the 2023 gathering to roll out the new generation of its GT coupe after a three-year hiatus. We already had sufficient technical detail to be excited about the 2024 AMG GT coupe, but now Mercedes has filled in the last important blank: The car will start at $136,050 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: A Return for the EQ-Avoidant\n\nPowertrain Specs and 0-60 MPH\n\nThe 2024 AMG GT coupe gets two versions of the same engine. In the AMG GT55, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine generates 469 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes says the GT55 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 183 mph. In the GT63, improved airflow and increased turbo boost amp output up to 577 hp and 590 pounds-feet. The additional power shortens the GT63’s sprint to 60 mph to just 3.1 seconds, and its top speed stretches to 196 mph. Both engines send their power through a nine-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels.\n\nStandard Performance Tech\n\nThe standard 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system continuously varies torque distribution, never sending more than 50% of available power to the front wheels but directing all of the power rearward in Drift mode. Drift mode is just one aspect of the AMG Dynamic Plus Package, which is also included on every AMG GT. The package additionally features an electronically controlled limited-slip differential and active engine mounts that can vary their firmness to isolate occupants from the engine’s vibrations for comfortable cruising or tighten up for quicker handling response during performance driving.\n\nOther standard equipment on the AMG GT includes rear-axle steering, active aerodynamics and AMG Active Ride Control, which features active roll stabilization to keep the body level during hard cornering.\n\nVast Personalization Menu\n\nAMG is offering 11 exterior paint colors on the GT, including six added-cost Manufaktur finishes. Numerous 20- and 21-inch wheels are available, as are nine upholstery options (seven of them Nappa leather and the remaining two Nappa leather with microfiber inserts). Naturally, there are multiple trim options, as well as available sport seats.\n\nBuyers looking for a more aggressive look can spec the optional AMG Aerodynamics Package, which adds air deflectors front and rear, a larger rear diffuser, and a fixed wing in place of the standard active spoiler. Also adding the AMG Carbon Fiber Package renders some of those bits — and the sill panel inserts, mirror housings and front splitter — in exposed carbon fiber.\n\nOf particular interest to buyers building out that last package is the available front-axle lift system to help the nose clear driveway transitions and speed bumps. Not only does it raise the nose 1.2 inches, but it’s tied into the GPS to “remember” obstacles and automatically raise the nose when encountering them again.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT coupe will arrive at dealerships in the spring. The GT55 will have a starting price of $136,050, and the GT63 will start at $177,050. Relative to the most expensive vehicle to sell at auction during Car Week, though — a 1967 Ferrari 412P Berlinetta that hammered for more than $30 million — its sticker seems reasonable.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMercedes-AMG GT Coupe, Roadster Go Stealth (but by No Means Stealthy) for 2021\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro: Not for Amateurs\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster: Test-Drive Video\n2022 Mercedes-AMG GT53 4-Door Review: A Stylish Compromise\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

The new 2021 Mercedes-AMG GT43 is slated to receive a slightly less powerful version of the turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine shared with the AMG GT53, but most of the more expensive trim’s amenities remain — as do the stunning good looks that all of the AMG GTs bring to the party.\n\nRelated: 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT Brings Stunning Concept Design to the Street\n\nThe biggest difference between the GT43 and GT53 (and the even more crazy GT63) lies under the hood, where you’ll find the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine that’s shared with the 53, but making a lesser 362 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque; it also features the EQ Boost mild-hybrid system that can add as much as 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque to the system when called upon. It’s still mated to an AMG-tuned nine-speed automatic transmission, and still routes power to all four wheels via Mercedes-Benz’ 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. Even this “entry-level” AMG GT43 is still good for a 0-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Mercedes. \n\nThe list of standard features is decent and includes an adjustable ride control sport suspension, silver-painted six-piston front brake calipers, a Burmester premium audio system, electronically deployable rear spoiler and the new Mercedes-Benz User Experience multimedia system that is now standard on all 2021 GT 4-Door models. \n\nOption packages will be similar to more expensive versions of the GT 4-Door, such as a variety of wheels, semi-autonomous driving systems and an even more premium Burmester 3D audio system. There’s also a choice of rear seat setup: either the standard pair of bucket seats or the Executive Rear Seat Package that ups the creature comforts. \n\nThe new AMG GT43 4-Door is set to go on sale late this year starting at $90,950 including destination fee. This puts it about $10,000 less than the GT53 4-Door, which has a starting price of $100,945 but features the more powerful 429-hp, six-cylinder engine, and about $50,000 less than the 577-hp, V-8-powered GT63. And if you want to go all out for the ultimate GT63 S 4-Door Coupe, you’ll have to fork over an additional $71,000 and change for that monster, which has a starting price of $162,195 — and that’s before you start adding any of the fun option packages. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With the 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT55 and GT63 coupes set to arrive at dealerships in the next few months, the luxury brand’s performance arm has already prepared the next member of the GT family, one that is sure to stir up some controversy. The brand is pitching the GT43 as the GT coupe for purists, and while it’s hard to argue that the all-wheel-drive, 469-horsepower GT55 and 577-hp GT63 are joyfully unholy, it’ll be interesting to see how the rear-drive GT43 is received with its turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe Returns From Hiatus, Starts at $136,050\n\nPowertrain Specs and 0-60 MPH\n\nDisplacing 2 liters, the GT43’s four is half the size of (and has half as many turbos as) the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8s in the GT55 and GT63. But not to worry, as its output is nowhere near proportional. With an electric motor mounted to the turbo, the four-cylinder cranks out 416 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. That’s down 147 pounds-feet from the GT55’s V-8, but only by 53 hp.\n\nAs in the V-8-powered cars, the only available transmission is a nine-speed automatic. In the GT43, however, that power goes only to the rear wheels, whereas the GT55 and GT63 are AWD. The brand’s specs for the GT43 list its curb weight as TBA; rarely do those letters inspire so much anticipation. Between the downsized engine and simplified drivetrain, the GT43 should be quite a bit lighter. Mercedes-AMG claims it will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and have a top speed of 174 mph, compared to 3.8 seconds and 183 mph for the GT55.\n\nSpot the Differences\n\nIt’ll take a keen eye to tell the four-cylinder coupe from its V-8 siblings. The GT43 wears slimmer fenders that make it 2.2 inches narrower and are pierced with smaller vents. Whereas the face of the GT55 and GT63 is all gaping maw, the GT43 has a tidier grille atop a lower intake that stretches nearly from wheel to wheel. Around back, it exhales through four round tailpipes, while the V-8s have squared-off outlets. The GT43 is fitted with 19-inch wheels as standard equipment, and a selection of 19-, 20- and 21-inch rims is available.\n\nLike its more powerful stablemates, the GT43 rides on an all-aluminum suspension fore and aft, but unlike them, it has traditional sway bars instead of a hydraulic anti-roll system. Mercedes-AMG Ride Control adaptive dampers, standard on the GT55 and GT63, are optional on the GT43. The brakes — 15.4-inch rotors and six piston calipers up front, 14.2-inch rotors and single-piston clamps in the rear — are shared among all three GTs, as are the active aerodynamic elements. Shutters behind the grille stay closed for improved aerodynamics, only opening when additional air is needed to cool the engine bay. The retractable spoiler deploys above 50 mph and can assume five different angles to optimize downforce or minimize drag, depending on the driver’s behavior.\n\nHighly Customizable\n\nThree exterior design packages are available for buyers to customize their look. The AMG Exterior Chrome Package fits shiny accent pieces to the front end and fenders, as well as the sill panels. The AMG Night Package finishes the splitter, sills, mirror housings and window trim in black, with dark-chrome tailpipe finishers and deep-tinted glass for the rear window. The AMG Night Package II builds on that with dark chrome for the grille and exterior badging.\n\nInside, the GT43 is indistinguishable from the other GTs — so long as the engine is off. Nappa leather AMG sport seats are standard, and performance seats are available. The driver faces a digital instrument cluster, with an 11.9-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash. While it’s unclear if the GT43 offers the same extensive interior palette as the V-8 cars, it does add two gray wood trim options: gray open-pore birch and brown open-pore ash ship-deck wood highlighted with aluminum strands.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: A Return for the EQ-Avoidant\nMercedes-AMG GT Coupe, Roadster Go Stealth (but by No Means Stealthy) for 2021\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n2022 Mercedes-AMG GT53 4-Door Review: A Stylish Compromise\nMore Mercedes-Benz News\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nMercedes-AMG hasn’t said when the 2025 GT43 Coupe will go on sale. Expect to see the four-cylinder variant in the fall, with a price that is yet to be announced but will surely be many thousands less than the GT55’s $136,050.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
