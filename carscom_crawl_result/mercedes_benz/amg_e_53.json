      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 a Fast Car? \n\nWith up to 604 horsepower, there’s no way Mercedes-AMG’s E53 wouldn’t be fast. We’re still waiting on the full-fat, full-power E63, but the E53 strikes an incredible balance between comfort and AMG performance, with a manufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph time as low as 3.7 seconds.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Compare With the Competition?\n\nThere aren’t many performance-lite plug-in hybrid executive sedans at this Mercedes’ price. Its most obvious competitor is the 2025 BMW 550e xDrive, but that car falls more than 100 hp short of the E53 — and costs $15,000 less. For now, the new PHEV BMW M5 is the E53’s closest competitor.\n\nI have a (rarely) tested theory on engine downsizing. When dealing with an enthusiast vehicle associated with a common number of cylinders (four, six, eight, etc.) you can only go down one “step” without incurring significant damage to the vehicle’s established character. There are limits, of course, but in most cases, going from a V-8 directly down to a four-cylinder — regardless of that four-cylinder’s power and performance — won’t usually curry favor with a loyal customer base.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Review: Luxury Always Changes\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG E53, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nWe’ve already covered AMG’s hybrid fours, but now consider the silky, syrupy, hybridized turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six in the new 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53. In this car, a base, engine-only output of 443 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque combines with a 161-hp electric motor for an indulgent 604 peak hp and 553 pounds-feet of combined torque. (Without an optional Race Start launch control system, the E53 has a combined 577 hp.) This, in symphony with a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, enables a 0-60 mph blast in as low as 3.7 seconds, according to Mercedes. (Without launch control, it still manages the task in just 3.9 seconds.)\n\nThat’s a juicy but distant howl away from the C63 S E Performance’s claimed 3.3-second blitz. You can thank the C63’s extra 67 hp and 199 pounds-feet of torque for that, though these two were never competitors to begin with. AMG’s 43 and 53 model lineup are intentionally positioned below the big, bad 63s, aimed at buyers who want a heavy slug of AMG booze in their mug of Mercedes-Benz coffee.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nHow Much Electric Range Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Have?\n\nWith or without that context, the E53 is a lovely executive sedan. Unlike the C63’s hybridized four-cylinders, this PHEV system adds more than just pure performance. With its 28.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack fully charged, the most efficient drivers can expect up to 43 miles of EPA-rated all-electric range, with 60-kilowatt DC fast charging allowing for a 10%-80% percent charge in about 20 minutes, according to Mercedes.\n\nPure electric propulsion is available up to 87 mph, so those with access to home charging and a moderate commute might rarely get to the E53’s hybrid function. When you do run out of range — or you get a little frisky with the drive settings — and that buttery 3.0-liter kicks in, you’ll be rewarded with the same on-paper power as an SL63, with straight-line pace on par with the V-8 E63s from the generation before last.\n\nLet’s loop back to the AMG hybrid four-cylinders. A hotted-up version of this 53 hybrid inline-six would have been a perfect step down from the last-gen C63’s 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8; alas, that was considered but then subsequently avoided due to the C-Class’ tighter packaging. But let’s continue with this thought experiment: With 577 hp combined without the E53’s temporary Race Start boost to 604 hp, you’ve got nearly a 100-hp delta in which to ramp up the character and optimization of the sixer to match the four-cylinder’s reality-ripping 671-hp waterline.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG E53, engine | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAh well. We’ll just have to wait and see what comes of the swirling rumors regarding the return of the AMG V-8 — not that it ever really left; it’s still in the latest generation of the G63, SL63 and S63 to name just a few. We’re still waiting on what the next-gen E63 will have under its hood, whether it be a spicier version of the E53’s six or an offshoot of that aforementioned V-8.\n\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Comfortable?\n\nForget the hypotheticals and all this navel gazing. The E53 exists now, and it’s surely one of the better balances of performance and comfort available at any price. Even if you’re not rousing the 3.0-liter for violence, the hybrid system hand-off is seamless, devoid of any sort of vibration or lurch. With the active exhaust left alone, it’s only vaguely grumblier than a standard E450. And unless you do a direct back-to-back comparison, the Comfort setting of the air suspension won’t be stiffer or more punishing in any obvious way.\n\nThe brake blend (the balance between the regenerative resistance of the motor and the physical brakes) is well tuned, with only a modest amount of initial “mush” before the discs bite in earnest. Oftentimes, poor regen and brake synergy is the Achilles’ heel of an otherwise pleasant hybrid, counterbalancing the smooth, muted drivetrain with inelegant, clunky stops.\n\nGeneral chassis dynamics significantly differ between the available drive modes, particularly in power delivery and personality. The same cannot necessarily be said of Audi’s S family, nor of BMW’s M-lite products, like the M340i or prior M550i; where the Audi is a bit too reserved, the BMW is a smidge too spiky. The E53, then, is your perfect bowl of porridge.\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG E53, front seat | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Drive in Electric Mode?\n\nThe all-electric mode is particularly soporific. Minus the gas engine, the E53 is left with GLB-grade acceleration. Factor in its silent operation, and (almost) every ounce of AMG pepper is muffled. But if you then select Sport Plus and smack it, a whole lotta something transpires behind the curtains as the turbo six-cylinder spools up, the transmission drops a few gears, and the AWD system gets involved — all in a matter of maybe, oh, a second-and-a-half.\n\nHard chargin’ down an on-ramp is both impressive and mostly thrilling, but to me it’s a bit joyless, as if the speed and capability are a side effect in this car, not the intention. Sentiments will differ person to person as a result of the E53’s charming duality. Your average buyer (who I think Mercedes knows well) will be tickled pink by the car’s stomach-squeezing torque and configurable drive modes.\n\nThere are things I don’t like, but they’re more endemic to the current-generation E-Class than they are to this particular variant. Those awful retracting door handles have gotta go; they never seem to work in complete lockstep with the keyless entry, and it all becomes unbelievably frustrating when you use keyless lock then realize you forgot something inside the car, oftentimes necessitating pulling the key fob out of your pocket to “manually” unlock it like it’s 2009 all over again!\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 S E Performance Review: Character Study\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE300 Coupe a Good Car? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nIs the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE450e a Good Plug-in Hybrid SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\nResearch the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53\nFind a New 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Near You\nWhat Kind of Tech Does the 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Have?\n\nOther concerns are more a matter of taste than execution. The in-cabin digital acreage is both impressive and divisive: A 12.3-inch digital driver display, 14.4-inch center infotainment touchscreen and optional 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen may very well be either among this car’s main selling points or the reason you keep moving through the dealer lot. Personally, I dig the displays, especially with the current iteration of MBUX architecture and the consistently high-fidelity animations and design.\n\nAs I found when I drove the E350 in 2024, this new generation of E-Class is not your grandfather’s Benz. It is, however, your favorite influencer’s Mercedes; its bottomless bucket of gizmos, whatsits, adjustable ambient lighting and digital toys will keep even the most low-attention-span social media goblin entertained — when they’re not driving, of course.\n\nTalk about a Swiss Army car. It’s balanced, but your checkbook won’t be; no matter how many options you leave on the factory floor, the cheapest 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 will set you back no less than $89,150. And you better believe you can get its price well above six figures: My heftiest configurator build cracked the digital scales at just under $120,000 — princely, but I struggle to think of a better plug-in performance sedan that hauls this much ass with so few downsides.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Mercedes-AMG E-Class has undergone a profound shift with the current generation’s switch from a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine to a turbocharged inline-six plug-in hybrid powertrain. Now, though, some familiarity has returned. With the new 2026 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Wagon, the long-roof/estate/touring body style returns to Mercedes’ meanest mid-sizer.\n\nRelated: Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class a Good Luxury Sedan? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\n\nWhat Are the AMG E53 Hybrid Wagon’s Specs?\n\nMechanically, the wagon is identical to the AMG E53 sedan that is already on sale. The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six generates 443 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque on its own, and with a potent electric motor nested in its nine-speed automatic transmission, total output swells to 577 hp and 553 pounds-feet. Opting for the Dynamic Plus Package nets buyers Race Start, which allows for up to 604 hp in case they need to drag race an Audi RS 6 Avant. (If drivers get “the look” from someone in a 717-hp BMW M5 Touring, it’s probably best to bow their heads in deference.)\n\nMercedes says the E53 Wagon will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4 seconds and have a top speed of 155 mph; with the Dynamic Plus Package, it will accelerate to 60 in 3.8 seconds and have a 174 mph top speed. The automaker hasn’t released an electric range yet, but with the same 21.2-kilowatt-hour battery pack here as in the sedan, a figure near that model’s 42 miles is likely. To the benefit of rushed commuters everywhere, top speed in electric mode is 87 mph.\n\nAlso included in the copy and paste from E53 sedan to wagon are standard all-wheel drive, rear-wheel steering and an adjustable suspension with adaptive dampers. In addition to the power boost and higher top speed, the Dynamic Plus Package includes active engine mounts, an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential and composite brakes with red calipers.\n\nEarly Adopters, Be Counted\n\nAs it has with other recent launches, AMG is celebrating the E53 Hybrid Wagon with a limited run of Edition 1 builds. Each is painted Alpine Grey and sports black exterior trim, AMG sill graphics and 21-inch wheels. The Edition 1 also boasts unique upholstery and additional standard equipment that the automaker will detail soon.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Wagon will go on sale later this year. Pricing will be announced closer to the start of sales, but for context, the 2025 sedan starts at $89,150 (price includes $1,150 destination charge).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n577-HP 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Hybrid Revealed\n2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: New RWD E350 Base Variant, Priced From $63,600\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\nResearch the Mercedes-AMG E53\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is available in four body styles and has a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder, six-cylinder and V-8 powertrains. The E350 has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 255 horsepower and the E450 gets a 362-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder. The high-performance AMG E53 has a 429-hp, turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder, while the line-topping AMG E63 boasts a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 with 603 hp. Stately and refined, the E350 and E450 blend a silky ride with reasonably sporty handling. The E450 All-Terrain wagon adds a modicum of off-road capability via an adjustable air suspension and SUV-style lower body cladding. The range-topping AMG models are outrageously quick, but they command commensurately lofty prices. E-Class rivals include the Audi A6,  BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Lexus ES.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class arrives in its many permutations with no significant updates or changes. A redesigned E-Class is slated to debut for the 2024 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nNavigation\nDual-zone climate control\nHands-free trunk lid\nHeated front seats\nTwo USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n360-degree parking camera  system\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\n23-speaker Burmester audio system\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAMG sport exhaust\nPower soft-close doors\nHeated rear seats\nInterior air purifier\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class should definitely make the shopping list of someone looking for a posh mid-size luxury vehicle. It offers a good balance between ride quality and handling even if a little more sparkle in terms of steering feel would be a welcome addition. The standard turbo four is perfectly fine in terms of acceleration and economy, but the silky nature of the turbo six-cylinder and extra grip from the available all-wheel-drive system are smart upgrades. Yes, the twin-turbo V-8 is a blast, but its high price and thirst for fuel are significant hurdles.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi S6, BMW M550i\n\nLooks like: The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, just a bit meaner\n\nPowertrain: Mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque (EQ Boost can briefly add an extra 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet); nine-speed automatic transmission; standard all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2020\n\nMercedes didn’t just update the vanilla E-Class for 2021, it also teamed with its AMG performance division to give the mid-tier E53 performance sedan similar updates. The E53 wears new styling front and rear, and it has an updated interior with AMG-specific technology and the latest version of Mercedes’ MBUX infotainment system.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: New Face, New Wagon\n\nExterior\n\nThe E53 will look meaner even than the E450 sedan, with dual power domes on its hood along with an AMG-specific grille and “A-wing” front bumper with five central vertical struts. The LED headlights and taillights are also a new design, as are the standard 19-inch and optional 20-inch wheels. Additionally, the rear bumper and rear diffuser have been revised for 2021. The optional AMG Night Package blacks out much of the exterior trim to create an even more aggressive look.\n\nInterior\n\nPerformance is the name of the game inside the cabin, with a new AMG performance steering wheel as standard equipment and standard sport seats wrapped in a combination of black MB-Tex faux leather and black Dinamica microfiber with red contrast stitching. Red seat belts are available.\n\nMBUX, Mercedes’ infotainment system, takes center stage in the 12.3-inch multimedia screen and can include the optional AMG Track Pace system to record lap and section times while monitoring vehicle data such as speed and acceleration. Track Pace can even use augmented reality to display the ideal racing line of certain stored racetracks in the head-up display.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nE53 buyers get only one choice of drivetrain: a mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission driving all four wheels via AMG’s Performance 4Matic Plus all-wheel-drive system. The engine produces 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque, and it can use an EQ Boost feature to increase those figures by 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet, respectively; Mercedes estimates the E53 can go from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds. The adjustable air suspension has three settings — Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus — that provide varying levels of stiffness as desired.\n\nSafety\n\nAdvanced safety features — things like a surround-view camera, blind spot collision avoidance and semi-autonomous driving features — are once again expected to be available through Mercedes’ Parking Assistance and Driver Assistance packages.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class mid-size luxury car is offered in sedan, wagon, coupe and convertible body styles. It offers a range of engines, including performance powertrains in the AMG variants. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and the E-Class competes against cars like the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Lexus GS.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nThe E350 sedan replaces the E300 and features a slightly more powerful 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. All variants now have standard blind spot warning and keyless access and starting. Coupe and convertible versions now have standard heated front seats, wireless device charging, satellite radio with a six-month trial, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a Burmester premium stereo.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe E-Class offers advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking and steering assistance, and it has the capability of warning other cars with its Car-to-X technology. The range of body styles should help you find a version that’s right for your needs, and high-powered AMG versions bump up the performance for driving enthusiasts. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class?\n\nIf you want a stylish mid-size luxury car that drives well, has a first-rate cabin and is packed with technology, the E-Class should meet your needs. However, it can get pricey with options, and the optional air suspension might be too firm for some people.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi S6, BMW 540i xDrive, Cadillac CTS-V\n\nLooks like: The CLS- and E-Class two-doors get the typical AMG treatment\n\nDrivetrain: Turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine with supplemental electric forced induction, mild-hybrid starter-alternator motor unit; nine-speed automatic transmission; standard all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Late 2018\n\nCARS.COM — Mercedes’ high-performance AMG division has released details of an interesting new variant on a few of the company’s performance cars. The new 2019 Mercedes-AMG E53 coupe, cabriolet and CLS53 four-door have been unveiled ahead of this week’s North American International Auto Show in Detroit, new entries in the AMG pantheon of vehicles, all featuring a novel new powertrain.\n\nRelated: More Detroit Auto Show Coverage\n\nExterior\n\nAll three of the new AMG 53-series models get the typical AMG styling treatment consisting of the twin-blade radiator grille, an “A-wing” front bumper design, AMG side sills, and a rear bumper with integrated diffuser and round, integrated tailpipes with chrome tips. The CLS53 takes things a little further, with specific air curtains integrated into the front bumper for improved aerodynamics and cooling. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard on the CLS53, with 20-inch models available.\n\nInterior\n\nLike all AMG models, the 53-series will come with upgraded materials and unique displays, with a standard dual 12.3-inch digital display for a full widescreen digital gauge cockpit. All models get sport seats and red seat belts, with the AMG Performance steering wheel as standard. The CLS53 will initially come only in a special-edition model, the Edition 1, which will feature a black Nappa leather interior with copper stitching and highlights, unique carbon-fiber trim and additional standard equipment.\n\nThe E53 coupe and cabriolet get a lot more color choices for their interiors than the previous E43 models. In addition to black with red or gray stitching, the E-Class models get the option of black and saddle brown, black and white, black and red, Designo red and macchiato beige, and Designo titanium gray and black. The CLS53 also gets several color options, including macchiato beige and magma gray, black and Bengal red, and espresso brown and magma gray.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThis is where the new 53-series gets interesting. A new turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine, featuring a turbocharger that is both electrically boosted and exhaust-boosted, will power all of the models. It relies on a new 48-volt electrical system powered by a powerful new starter-alternator unit that is sandwiched between the engine and the transmission. That high-zoot electrical system powers a separate electric intake compressor providing almost no turbo lag, according to Mercedes, supplementing the conventional exhaust-gas turbocharger that’s also fitted to the engine. This “EQ Boost” system helps improve performance dramatically, with the company citing the new CLS53’s estimated zero-to-60-mph time of just 4.4 seconds, with far more immediate throttle response.\n\nThe turbocharged engine itself produces 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque, but it’s augmented by the powerful starter-alternator motor, which can electrically add as much as 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque for launch. The EQ Boost starter-alternator also acts as a kind of mild-hybrid unit for the vehicles, motivating the car during throttle-off cruising and allowing the engine to shut down and restart almost imperceptibly, according to Mercedes. The benefit of the system is the delivery of a performance vehicle with improved emissions and efficiency without any loss in sporty abilities.\n\nThe engine output is routed through a nine-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via the specially tuned AMG Performance 4Matic Plus all-wheel-drive system. The 48-volt electrical system that powers the drivetrain mates up using a DC-to-DC converter to the more conventional 12-volt system that powers the rest of the car’s systems like lights, interior electronics and body control units.\n\nOther highlights of the 53-series models include an adjustable electronic air suspension, electromechanical speed-sensitive steering, and high-performance internally ventilated brakes front and rear.\n\nSafety\n\nA lot of equipment from the S-Class carries into the 53-series models, including standard active braking assist, attention assist and Pre-Safe Sound occupant protection systems. Optional are a bunch of additional systems like the Driving Assistance Package that includes Distronic active distance keeping, active steering assist, active speed limit assist, active braking assist with cross-traffic function, evasive steering assist, active blind spot monitor, active lane-keeping assist and much, much more.\n\nThe new CLS53, E53 coupe and E53 cabriolet are slated to arrive in American showrooms toward the end of 2018.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
