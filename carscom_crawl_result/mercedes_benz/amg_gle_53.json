      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz continues the rollout of its redesigned GLE-Class SUVs with the sportier fastback “coupe” variant, unveiling the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE53 featuring the company’s new turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system.\n\nRelated: Mercedes-Benz Boosts Mid-Size SUV Lineup With AMG GLE53\n\nThe new coupe-SUV mashup model picks up much of the front-end look of the coming AMG 53 version of the redone 2020 GLE conventional SUV. The coupe, however, rides on a 2.4-inch-shorter wheelbase, and the roof and rear styling are all its own. The fastback roofline seems more sloped than the current GLE Coupe, and the rear is a softer and relatively more graceful design (the rear end seems to be the thorniest design problem for these Euro “four-door coupe” models). Check out the gallery above and judge for yourself. Otherwise, the coupe model gets mildly aggressive AMG styling cues; expect the likely full-on AMG 63 V-8 down the road to be wilder. While other markets get non-AMG versions, too, the current GLE Coupe is offered only in AMG models here.\n\nThe new powertrain, which made its debut in AMG 53 versions of the current E-Class models and the 2019 CLS, features a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, with a starter-generator motor sandwiched between the engine and the nine-speed AMG automatic transmission. AMG performance all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nThe engine puts out 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque. The starter-generator system, which Mercedes calls EQ Boost, can add 21 hp and 184 pounds-feet of torque for launch, and it also feeds the 48-volt electrical system. The system powers a separate electric intake compressor that supplements the engine’s conventional exhaust-gas turbocharger. EQ Boost also improves efficiency by functioning as a mild-hybrid system that can recoup energy, motivate the SUV during throttle-off gliding and power the stop-start system for “practically unnoticeable” engine restarting, according to Mercedes. Zero-to-60 mph is estimated at 5.2 seconds, and the top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph.\n\nThe AMG-flavored interior — as well as the full range of AMG chassis and electronic performance systems and options — also follow on from the 2020 AMG GLE53 conventional SUV. The 2021 GLE53 Coupe will make its auto show debut in September at the Frankfurt auto show in Germany, and it will go on sale in the U.S. in mid-2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE mid-size SUV seats five in standard form or seven with its available third row, and it’s available with a variety of powertrains and options. All GLEs come with all-wheel drive. The base GLE350 is powered by a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. A 375-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, while a 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. All three powertrains are equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems. A new-for-2024 GLE450e plug-in hybrid pairs a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a 23.3-kilowatt-hour battery for a total of 381 hp and an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 48 miles. \n\nFor high-performance buyers, Mercedes offers two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and 603-hp AMG GLE63S. Both are available as a traditional SUV or in a sloped-roof coupe body style; the latter features a fastback-style tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design.\n\nWith so many permutations, the GLE’s competition is varied, including the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nIn addition to the new 450e PHEV variant, the GLE lineup gets freshened exterior styling that includes a revised front grille and bumper design, along with new wheel designs and interior details. Other updates include a new steering wheel and the latest version of the MBUX infotainment interface, which can be equipped with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHeated front seats\nPower liftgate\n360-degree camera system\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nForward collision warning with automatic braking\nBlind spot warning \nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin air fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests \nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad sign recognition\nMBUX voice recognition\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes GLE certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options, but even in its base format, it’s elegantly appointed, and the 255-hp turbo four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. Venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, though: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE delivers the power and luxury you expect from a vehicle sporting the three-pointed star emblem. Available in traditional SUV or Coupe format, the latter features a truncated tail to give it a sportier (albeit less practical) design. The standard engine is a 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder, which is fitted to the front- or all-wheel-drive GLE350; a 362-hp, turbocharged inline-six powers the GLE450, and a 504-hp, twin-turbo V-8 is used in the GLE580. Both the 450 and 580 are equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid systems and come standard with AWD. But wait, there are also two AMG-tuned models: the 429-hp AMG GLE53 and 603-hp AMG GLE63S. With so many permutations, the GLE’s competition is varied and includes the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Land Rover Range Rover Sport and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe 2023 GLE gets new metallic paint colors but is otherwise unchanged. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nMBUX voice recognition\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nHands-free power liftgate\nHands-free park assist\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nBlind spot warning system\nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats with massage function\nCabin air fragrance diffuser\nThird-row seating\nHeated armrests \nHeated and cooled cupholders\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nHead-up instrument display\nRoad sign recognition\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE certainly spoils SUV shoppers when it comes to options. Even in its base format, though, the GLE is elegantly appointed, and the 255-hp turbo four won’t make you feel like you’ve skimped on power. When venturing to higher trims, you’re greeted with gobs more horsepower and a dizzying array of comfort and tech features. It’s not perfect, of course: The optional third-row seats are cramped for adults, and some of the fancier onboard tech requires patience and time spent with the owner’s manual.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Mercedes-Benz GLE was already an excellent mid-size luxury SUV, so AMG treatment just adds equal parts speed, silliness and serious bucks.\n\nVersus the competition: In the realm of expensive, overpowered, medium-sporty luxury SUVs, the GLE53 fits oddly between top luxury and top performance trim levels of competing SUVs in terms of both price and power.\n\nI don’t know how the German luxury brands are doing it. Go into any of their dealerships or peruse their various websites and you’ll find a dozen SUVs of slightly different sizes. Some are tall-riding “coupe”-style SUVs and some are more traditional, but each has several trim levels that amp up the power, style, performance and bottom-line price in increasingly complicated trim stratifications and an alphabet soup of model names. Mercedes-Benz is no exception.\n\nRelated: Which Vehicles Have the Best Warranty Coverage?\n\nThis SUV is the 2022 Mercedes-AMG GLE53, a name that requires some deciphering (though not as much as do most BMWs). For starters, it’s Mercedes-AMG, not Mercedes-Benz, because it’s part of Mercedes’ sub-brand of AMG-branded performance models, and the GLE is the automaker’s mid-size luxury SUV. The number attached to those letters once denoted engine displacement, but now it’s just a number (53) that lets you know it slots between the lesser GLE450 and the more powerful, V-8-equipped Mercedes-AMG GLE63. Finally, note that the model discussed here is the GLE SUV, not the GLE Coupe. That model has a chopped roofline and less practical space — and it costs more money.\n\nWhat’s confusing about the AMG GLE53 is that its competitors offer either more power for more money or less power for less money, but no model lines up all that directly with the GLE53. That said, we’ll talk about it here in a couple of ways: Is it any good on its own, and is there a better choice (either within Mercedes or from a competing manufacturer) instead?\n\nExtra Flash\n\nThe GLE53 gets some visual changes versus the GLE450, and they do a good job making this a sportier-looking model. The requisite AMG-style grille is present, with chrome trim and an A-Wing design, and it’s accompanied by a deeper front splitter under the bumper. My test vehicle had 21-inch wheels with black accents to go along with black exterior paint, giving the whole SUV a menacing, murdered-out look that’s really quite appealing. It looks like it’ll be fun to drive — at least, as much as any five-seat family SUV could be — hitting all the right notes to amp up its presence without being gaudy or outrageous. As we used to say, it looks money.\n\nThings get even more dramatic inside, with splashes of red Nappa leather upholstery amid somber black surroundings and optional brushed aluminum trim. Everything is of the benchmark quality for which Mercedes-Benz is known; from button actuation to the way the switches and covers move, everything is smooth, damped and upscale.\n\nThe regular GLE is a comfortable SUV, but the AMG modifications make it a little less so: The seats are more firmly bolstered, and the steering wheel is shapely but not heated. In short, opting for the GLE53 means giving up some of the convenience items you’d expect in a $90,000 luxury vehicle in exchange for a sportier attitude befitting the AMG label. Admittedly, some of those trades are pretty cool, such as AMG Drive Unit steering-wheel buttons that are part of an AMG Dynamic Plus Package. They let you adjust settings like sport exhaust and drive mode via a neat little rotary wheel on the steering wheel itself. There are also a couple of ancillary organic light-emitting diode buttons that control other features.\n\nIt is not, however, a perfect interior. We still think Mercedes-Benz overcomplicates its touch-sensitive steering-wheel controls, gauge cluster information and multimedia system. The automaker’s latest MBUX multimedia system is here, and while it does have a rather significant learning curve, it generally works well — aside from the voice controls, which are still a bit buggy;  you can’t say the word “Mercedes” at all, such as in conversation with passengers, without triggering the system.  But it does provide some fun gee-whiz features, like augmented reality navigation, that are pretty cool.\n\nExtra Dash\n\nPowering the AMG GLE53 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making a hefty 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a slick nine-speed automatic transmission that drives all four wheels through permanent all-wheel drive. It’s growly and responsive, and it can fling the SUV from 0-60 mph in 5.2 seconds, Mercedes says. That’s reasonably quick for a mid-size SUV, and the powertrain’s responsiveness is among the GLE53’s highlights.\n\nHandling is another. Steering feel is excellent — nicely weighted, full of proper feedback and managed through a thick AMG-style steering wheel that feels good in your hands. The GLE53’s adjustable suspension does an admirable job keeping the SUV level in corners, but there’s no getting around the fact that you’re sitting high up with a high center of gravity. I’d happily trade one of this AMG’s sport modes for the Curve mode found in the GLE450, which is an adaptive suspension mode that tilts the SUV in corners like an airplane, minimizing lateral G-forces. The GLE53 is indeed sportier and more aggressive than a basic GLE450, and it brakes better and sounds better, but its level of “sport” adjustability borders on silly.\n\nThe AMG treatment is meant to make you think this is a track-capable sports machine, complete with special lap timers, gauges, super sport modes and more. But that concept is ridiculous; a tall-riding, five-occupant, family SUV is simply not what you drive on a track, it’s the thing you drive to the track — perhaps towing your sports car on a trailer behind you.\n\nAll the effort put into trying to create a “sports-car SUV” just seems wasted to me. It’s all about image; these AMG SUVs are far more likely to clog the valet stand at Spago than carve corners at Spa-Francorchamps. I’ve yet to see a driver take their “performance” SUV to a track day or autocross. A vehicle like this is at its best traversing the high-speed Autobahn between two European cities — or at least looking to other American “affluencers” as if that’s something you do.\n\nValue Option?\n\nThe performance goodies and styling improvements on the AMG GLE53 look and sound great, but it’s hard to match it up against a proper competitor. BMW offers the less expensive and less powerful X5 xDrive40i (335 hp and 5.3 seconds from 0-60 mph) for nearly $10,000 less, and the more expensive, more powerful X5 M50i (523 hp, 4.1 seconds) for about $10,000 more. Audi has the much less expensive SQ5 (349 hp, 4.7 seconds), but not a more powerful (or expensive) version of the Q5. The even less expensive Alfa Romeo Stelvio Veloce comes only with a 280-hp turbo four-cylinder or in a fire-breathing 505-hp Quadrifoglio trim for a lot more money than the GLE53. A Jaguar F-Pace R-Dynamic is less powerful, less expensive and slower, while an F-Pace SVR is more powerful, more expensive and quicker. Mercedes-Benz is either being clever, finding a niche nobody else has explored, or it has misplaced and mispriced this trim level in an area nobody else finds worthy of the investment.\n\nThe AMG GLE53 SUV starts at $74,600 (including destination). The version I drove had some choice options, including a $2,990 red leather interior, 21-inch wheels, performance exhaust, heated and ventilated multicontour seats, and multiple option packages (Driver Assistance, Acoustic Comfort and AMG Performance), bringing the grand total up to $90,550.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\n2021 Mercedes-AMG GLA45: 5 Things We Like and 5 We Don’t\n2022 Mercedes-EQ EQB: The GLB Goes Electric\nBlank Backup Camera Prompts Recall of 342,000 Mercedes Cars, SUVs\n\nSo back to our original question: Is the GLE53 any good on its own? Yes, it really is. It provides a more engaging driving experience than a standard GLE, though it comes at the cost of that SUV’s stellar comfort and a few luxury amenities. It’s quick, it’s quiet and it’s certainly a better idea than the truly daft AMG GLE53 Coupe, which eliminates the standard GLE’s useful cargo area and backseat headroom in favor of questionable styling.\n\nComparing the AMG GLE53 SUV against competitors, however, makes the question more challenging. It really is in a class of one; competitor SUVs are either cheaper and less powerful (but sometimes quicker) or more expensive and a lot more powerful. But if the GLE53 can find a sweet spot, it’ll be as a more budget-friendly alternative to those models (if a $90,000 SUV can really be referred to as a “value” option) and a strong SUV on its own.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The GLE Coupe is the less practical, more stylish twin to Mercedes-Benz’s mid-size GLE SUV, with a fastback roofline that trades rear-seat and cargo space for a dramatic profile. Prior to the 2025 model year, Mercedes-Benz was so confident that buyers of the coupe were committed to sport that it only offered the model in two AMG trims. New for 2025 is a non-AMG entry-level trim, the GLE450 4Matic; it costs around $15,000 less than the AMG GLE53 and starts at $77,550 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S Coupe: Will It Track? Should It Track?\n\nWhile the GLE450 doesn’t have an AMG engine beneath its hood, it does sport a standard AMG exterior styling package and 20-inch AMG wheels. Numerous new paint and upholstery options for all three trim levels ensure that buyers can spec their GLE Coupe exactly how they want.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nGLE450 4Matic: $77,550\nAMG GLE53: $93,300\nAMG GLE63 S: $133,300\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe new GLE450 4Matic might be the new entry-level variant, but it is far from basic. It squats on adaptive dampers and 20-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 64-color ambient lighting and a power tilt/telescoping steering column. Standard tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nIn addition to its base composition, the GLE450 is available in two trim packages. The $1,300 Exclusive Trim Package includes ventilated front seats and a 13-speaker Burmester sound system. To that, the Pinnacle Trim adds upgraded LED headlights, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, a fragrance diffuser, a head-up display, heated and cooled front cupholders, gesture controls and animated Mercedes-logo puddle lamps for $5,300.\n\nDespite the $50,000-plus window in their base prices, every 2025 GLE Coupe includes the same standard driver-assistance technologies. The suite includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver attention monitor, a 360-degree parking camera, automated parking and automatic high beams.\n\nThe AMG GLE53 rides on 21-inch wheels and a sport suspension with air springs and adaptive dampers; it also gets upgraded brakes and headlights, a performance exhaust, augmented-reality navigation and the contents of the Exclusive Trim Package. Here, the Pinnacle Trim Package costs just $3,300 since some of its content is already standard.\n\nThere are no trim packages available on the AMG GLE63 S, as all of the Pinnacle equipment is standard. Also included are 22-inch wheels, larger brakes, active anti-roll bars, an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential, dynamic engine mounts, heated windshield washers, massaging and rapid-heating front seats, and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Driver Assistance Package is optional on all three variants and costs $1,950. It bundles adaptive cruise control, emergency steering assist, front cross-traffic alert, blind spot intervention, lane-centering steering, lane change assist, traffic jam assist and road-sign recognition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 Review: Solitude Over Sportiness\nIIHS: Backseat-Passenger Safety Lacking in Some Mid-Size SUVs\nIs the Mercedes-AMG GLE53 a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like and 3 We Don’t\nResearch Mercedes-Benz\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe GLE450 4Matic is powered by a mild-hybrid turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine with 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque. A turbo 3.0-liter inline-six also powers the AMG GLE53, but it generates 429 hp and 413 pounds-feet, which Mercedes claims is good for a 4.9-second sprint from 0-60 mph, an improvement of 0.4 second over the GLE450 4Matic. At the top of the GLE Coupe food chain is the AMG GLE63 S. It boasts a 603-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 churning out 627 pounds-feet of torque and rockets to 60 mph in a claimed 3.7 seconds.\n\nAll three engines are paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard 4Matic all-wheel drive. The AMGs get the upgraded 4Matic+, which is capable of quicker torque delivery to the front and rear wheels and can send up to 100% of the power to the rear axle.\n\nThe 2025 GLE450 returns an EPA-rated 19/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The AMG GLE53 is rated at 18/22/20 mpg and the AMG GLE63 at 14/19/16 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
