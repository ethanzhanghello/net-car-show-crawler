      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA is a luxury subcompact SUV with seating for five and a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder engines, paired with a mild-hybrid system and front- or all-wheel drive. The most powerful drivetrain is reserved for the AMG GLA35, which delivers 302 horsepower and comes solely with AWD. The regular GLA250 has a 221-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter hybrid four-cylinder. All GLAs use an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the GLA’s sleek shape limits its overall practicality, it remains a refined and stylish alternative to rivals like the BMW X1, Volvo XC40, Audi Q3 and Lexus UX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nAfter a refresh for 2024, the GLA carries over for 2025 with just one minor change: The available 360-degree camera system can now be ordered as a stand-alone option (it was previously offered only as part of an option package).\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLA Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nPower-adjustable front seats\nPower liftgate\n64-color ambient interior lighting\n10.25-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFive USB-C ports\nSix-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nCrosswind assist\nRain-sensing windshield wipers\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic sunroof\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\n12-speaker Burmester audio system\nAMG Performance all-wheel-drive system\nSport exhaust\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA is an attractive and highly maneuverable pick among premium small SUVs; if rock-crawling abilities and loads of cargo space are your priorities, however, you’ll want to look elsewhere. The GLA’s size makes it easy to place exactly where you want it, and its turbocharged hybrid four-cylinder engines provide plenty of character. Performance is peppy, and fuel economy is solid for a small SUV. The AMG variant amps up the GLA’s performance, but it also demands a hefty price premium over the base 250.",

The most powerful drivetrain is reserved for the AMG GLA 35, which delivers 302 horsepower and comes solely with AWD. As for the regular GLA 250, it has a 221-hp, 2.0-liter hybrid turbo-four.

The GLA’s list of standard equipment grows longer, too, now including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Mercedes says the new 48-volt mild-hybrid system can add 13 hp under certain driving conditions and makes the powertrain’s stop-start function smoother.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Lexus UX, BMW X1 and X2\n\nLooks like: The GLA grew up\n\nDrivetrain: 221-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (GLA250); 302-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (Mercedes-AMG GLA35) \n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2020 (GLA250); late 2020 (AMG GLA35)\n\nMercedes-Benz’ littlest SUV is getting a significant update for 2021, with a new-look exterior that brings its design more in line with the rest of Mercedes’ SUVs and gives the GLA a more traditional SUV appearance. It also gets the new four-cylinder engines that have spread to the rest of the brand’s smaller models, from the A-Class and CLA-Class sedans to the all-new GLB SUV. That includes the Mercedes-AMG GLA35 getting a 302-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder and, hopefully, an upcoming GLA45 with a 382-hp, turbo four.\n\nRelated: Next Mercedes GLA-Class SUV Gains Needed Height\n\nExterior\n\nThe updated looks don’t do anything to disguise the GLA’s size, but the new model is more than 3.9 inches taller than its predecessor as well as 0.6 inches shorter in length. The exterior design is also more in keeping with the latest design language coming out of the German automaker’s Stuttgart headquarters, giving the GLA a more upright look than the first generation. Mercedes still gave the GLA a sportier and more coupelike appearance compared with its more traditional GLB counterpart, but the GLA now looks much less like a slightly lifted hatchback.\n\nThe grille can be either Mercedes’ latest single-louver design for the GLA250 or the AMG-specific horizontal-bar design for the AMG GLA35. The headlights, like the rest of the vehicle, sit more level instead of the more raked design of the previous GLA. In the rear, the taillights are more compact units that allow for a wider liftgate opening and give the GLA a wider appearance overall.\n\nInterior\n\nAlmost every interior measurement of the new GLA is larger than the previous generation, thanks in part to the overall height increase. Mercedes says front headroom is increased by 0.8 inches and, despite the GLA being shorter in height by 0.6 inches, the wheelbase is 1.1 inches longer, giving backseat passengers a claimed 4.5 inches of extra legroom. Not every measurement increased, however, as rear headroom is down 0.3 inches and front legroom by 0.8 inches.\n\nA 7-inch digital gauge cluster is standard and a 10.25-inch version is optional; each pairs with an identically sized touchscreen multimedia display, powered by MBUX, the latest infotainment system from Mercedes. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard. The AMG GLA35 gets the dual 10.25-inch displays — what Mercedes calls the “widescreen” setup — as standard.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nBoth front- and all-wheel-drive versions of the GLA250 will get a new, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The engine is good for 221 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque and will move the GLA250 from 0-60 mph in an estimated 8.6 seconds.\n\nThe AMG GLA35 comes with standard all-wheel drive and a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder good for 302 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, along with a differently tuned eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Mercedes says the AMG version of the GLA can go from 0-60 mph in approximately 5.0 seconds.\n\nStandard on the all-wheel-drive GLA250, the Off-Road Engineering Package gives drivers an additional driving mode focused on off-road driving and a Downhill Speed Regulation feature that limits downhill speed to a set speed from 1 to 11 mph.\n\nSafety\n\nSome active safety features, like braking assist and a driver attention monitor, are standard, but most are still included as part of the optional Driver Assistance Package. That includes adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist with lane-centering steering, lane change assist, active emergency braking, active blind spot assist and a speed-limit assist feature that uses the in-car navigation system to keep the GLA from exceeding what it believes is the posted speed limit.\n\nMercedes has yet to release pricing information, but we should learn that as we get closer to the GLA250’s summer 2020 on-sale date. Pricing for the AMG GLA35 may not be revealed until closer to that version’s release date later next year.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA is a subcompact luxury SUV with seating for five and a choice of several turbocharged four-cylinder engines. The most powerful are reserved for the AMG GLA35 and AMG GLA45 variants, which offer 302 and 382 horsepower, respectively. As for the regular GLA250, it has a 221-hp, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic and your choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Performance is peppy, and fuel economy is solid for a small SUV. While the sleek shape limits the overall practicality of the GLA, it remains a refined and stylish alternative to rivals like the BMW X1, Volvo XC40, Audi Q3 and Lexus UX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThere are no notable changes or updates for the GLA range for the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nPower-adjustable front seats\nPower liftgate\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nSix-speaker audio system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning system\nCrosswind assist\nRain-sensing wipers \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n64-color ambient interior lighting\n10.25-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\n12-speaker Burmester audio system\nAMG Performance all-wheel-drive system\nSport exhaust\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLA?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLA is an attractive and highly maneuverable pick among premium small SUVs. If rock-crawling abilities and loads of cargo space are your top priorities, however, you’ll want to look elsewhere. Its size makes the GLA easy to place exactly where you want it, and the turbocharged four-cylinder engines provide plenty of character. The AMG variants considerably amp up the GLA’s performance, but they also demand a hefty price premium over the regular GLA250.",
