      "expert_review": "My heart is broken.\n\nIt happened the day two goons showed up and took away the bright red Mercedes-Benz 500 SL convertible, this week’s test car.\n\nAt first I was skeptical. Before I so much as sat in it, I said even if I had the cash there’s no way I’d blow $100,000 on a car. How could any car be worth that much?\n\nBefore I would shell out six figures for a car, it will have to drive on water and fly.\n\nWell guess what?\n\nThe 500 SL does in a way.\n\nA powerful 32-valve V-8 gives the sleek Benz an almost supersonic top speed. And a traction control system keeps the tires from losing grip on wet roads.\n\nDriving the test car for a week had me contemplating any number of desperate scenarios.\n\nSomehow, I must have this car.\n\nEven if I sold everything I own – including Fred, my intrepid dachshund – I couldn’t even afford to pay the interest on the loan. So, I approached the boss and campaigned for a massive, vulgar raise.\n\nIt didn’t work.\n\nNot one to give up, I have taken the advice of a co-worker, who said, ”Keep on playin’ the lottery, baby.”\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nAt 4,145 pounds, the 500 SL is one of the heaviest cars I have ever driven. The test car came with a 322-horsepower fuel injected V-8 with four cams, 32 valves and a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe 500 SL has a less expensive brother, the 300 SL, that comes with a 3.0-liter straight six and either a five-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nDespite all that poundage, the 500 SL can really fly. A light foot will ensure smooth and leisurely acceleration from a stop because the transmission starts in second gear. A little extra pressure on the accelerator will shift the transmission into first gear for tire-spinning takeoffs.\n\nI am not sure I like this feature. The shifts from second to first were rough. But when the engine hits 3,500 rpm, things get interesting.\n\nThe engine seems to develop most of its power between 3,500 and 5,000 rpm. Unfortunately, you can’t utilize it. Revving the engine that high will get the car moving about 90 mph.\n\nMercedes-Benz claims a zero-to-60 mph time of 6.2 seconds.\n\nThe 500 SL had a hefty appetite for unleaded premium. It was the most expensive-to-fuel car I have driven this year. It burned almost $50 worth of gas in 489 miles. The car returned about 16 miles per gallon in combined city/highway driving. That’s poor enough to attract the attention of the government: There’s a $2,100 gas guzzler tax levied on each 500 SL sold. And speaking of taxes, 500 SL buyers must pay another $6,750 for luxury tax.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe ride is stable and steady but not athletic. Maybe it’s because of the car’s weight, but you never get the feeling that you can fling the 500 SL around. It’s heavy to the point of requiring a lot of effort in city driving.\n\nThe car has something of a wooden, soggy feel to it. Nowhere is this feeling better demonstrate d than in the brakes. They worked well, but the pedal was exceedingly heavy.\n\nAlso, the steering response couldn’t be described as crisp or especially responsive. I took several curves at 60 mph and found the 500 SL can be coaxed into some sporting maneuvers but it takes a lot of work.\n\nMercedes-Benz leaned toward giving the 500 SL more of a luxury car pedigree instead of making it a sports car. If Mercedes could find a way to lose about 600 pounds and lighten the controls, the 500 SL could be a real mean machine.\n\nThe suspension system is quite capable of preventing road noise and minor bumps from reaching the driver. Rolling over a speed bump is nearly undetectable.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz 500 SL ranks as one of the best-built cars you can buy. Pieces fit together with awesome precision. The fully automatic convertible top truly is something to marvel at.\n\nPressing one button is all it takes to raise and lower the black cloth top, ano eration that is carried out ina manner of seconds.\n\nThe 500 SL cruised over the worst terrain I could find, a dirt road peppered with deep holes and gashes. I heard no rattles and detected no untoward shakes. The body is amazingly stiff for a convertible.\n\nYou expect a little cowl shake in a soft-top, but the 500 SL was as sturdy as a hardtop.\n\nThe seats are a work of art. They are sculpted to provide excellent lower back and thigh support. They are equipped with a memory feature, and of course, a myriad of power adjustments.\n\nAll electrical accessories were easy to control and they worked well, but something was notably absent. For $100,000, why isn’t the 500 SL equipped with a CD player?\n\nTo its credit the car did have a built-in hands-free cellular phone.\n\nThe car’s greatest feature, though, isn’t mechanical. It’s the styling. The car turned heads and elicited compliments almost every time I took it out.\n\nIn the 500 SL, Mercedes-Benz has built a car that will be regarded as a timeless classic.\n\nTruett’s tip: Even though the price is absurd, the 500SL convertible has a way of massaging your ego that few automobiles can match. It’s expensive, but worth it.",

      "expert_review": "This car’s got a mind of its own.\n\nI am coming into Boston from the north on a wet day, up on the bridge just before the Fleet Center. Traffic’s not bad, but there are vast puddles.\n\nDon’t tell my last driving instructor this, but I do not have my hands at the 10- and 2-o’clock positions on the wheel. I’ve got one hand draped over the wheel, trying to gently coax the car through the slop, feeling what it wants to do. But something else is driving the car. I hit a puddle, and the car slows and corrects itself to keep going straight ahead.\n\nI hit a steel expansion joint on the bridge, and whatever slight traces of spin that wet steel imparts to the rear-drive wheels is picked up and the car goes into electronic stability mode. I notice the same thing later on a loose gravel road. The Mercedes SL500 wants to drive itself. Even with electronic stability off, it does its own braking when a rear wheel starts to slip.\n\nBut maybe when you buy a Mercedes, this is what you are looking for: straight-ahead power and the virtual certainty that you will not get into trouble.\n\nThis 8-cylinder (12 cylinders available in the SL600), two-seater is the sports car for those who want hunkered-down reliability, solid weight (more than 2 tons) that does not get skittish on corners, and cruising almost like a luxury sedan’s.\n\nIt is a long, gorgeous wedge of car, made more eye-opening because of the luxury of its special interior.\n\nThis is one of the 10 special-edition models in a new European-inspired factory program called Designo. It is aimed at solid Mercedes buyers who are ready to stretch their limits just a bit and put together their own package of designer amenities — those amenities coming in the forms of paint, leather, and wood.\n\nSpecial paint colors include black diamond, silver, green, copper, and slate blue. The leather combinations for seats and paneling include light brown, blue and charcoal, green and charcoal, copper and charcoal, charcoal, shell, black and red, dark blue and black. Wood trims are also optional in some models.\n\nElegant in the right hands, customer choice can sometimes lead to garish combos.\n\n“Looks like Elvis’s bedroom,” a friend said as he gazed upon the red and black leather interior of my black diamond SL500. But to each their own, though the possibilities for elegance or gaudiness will be limited since Mercedes plans to produce only 250-500 of each Designo model annually.\n\nSo forget color and hop inside.\n\nFine, soft leather seats. Firm sides from hips to shoulders. Long, broad and firm base with myriad levels of adjustment behind and below. Move the seat back and the seat belts adjust and the headrests rise, assuming if you are moving back, you are likely taller than the seat’s last occupant.\n\nGrab the leather-wrapped wheel and look around.\n\nLight controls in a pod to the left. Straight ahead, a package of gauges — gas gauge alone, a grouping that includ es oil and water readouts and one for miles per gallon at current operation, then the speedomoter and tachometer in separate rims, and, off to the right, the clock.\n\nSimple controls at center dash: climate up top, audio below, and just below that a hodgepodge including controls for the trunk lid, towing protection, central locking, hazard lights, stability control, adaptive dampening, and the roll bar.\n\nControls for windows, mirror, heated seats, and the convertible roof are clustered around the stick for the five-speed, electronically-controlled, automatic (with driver-adaptive option) transmission.\n\nYou’re surrounded by front and side airbags as you gaze out over the long hood. On rainy days, a single, broad wiper blade cleans the windshield with remarkable sweep.\n\nOn a sunny day, drop the roof — a remarkable mechanical event in itself. Push a single button and hold it until all is done and the windows go down. The rear quarter of the roof unlatches itself an folds up against the main roof. Now the main roof unlatches with a loud snap from the frame at the top of the windshield and lifts itself. In the rear, a leather panel rises and the roof drops into its storage compartment. The panel drops to cover the roof as the roll bar, which had moved to get out of the way, comes back up, as do the windows.\n\nCool fall day, maybe too cool for a ragtop? No problem. Crank the automatic climate control to 92 degrees and you are bathed in warmth even as crisp fall air swirls about the car.\n\nYou won’t find much storage space — narrow, covered slots in the doors (deep and hard-to-reach bottom in them), and two small storage areas between the seats.\n\nFire up the engine and a restrained rumble bubbles from the exhaust. Notice that the brake and gas pedal seem to have extra, unnecessary travel in them.\n\nNotice just how long that hood is, and you’ll understand why this car “drives long,” unlike smaller sports cars. It is quiet on the road, cruises at 75 at just over 2,000 rpms.\n\nIt is not remarkable off the line and has a strange acceleration lag (almost like a turbo lag). But punch it at speed, while turning 2,000-5,000 rpms, and it jumps to the job, sending the car surging ahead (autobahn-like).\n\nThe Electronic Stability Program helps avoid slides and spins by correcting for over- and understeer. It uses torque and brake controls to accomplish this.\n\nIt stops fast and straight even from high speeds, ABS aided by a brake assist system that boosts maximum power to the brakes when the pedal is stomped, as in an emergency, and held there.\n\nA solid cruiser. Fast as you wanna be. Reliable. A Mercedes.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n— The fabric covering at the lower-front portion of the doors will get rubbed to tatters by the leading foot of emerging occupants.\n\n— The lids on both between-the-seat storage bins jammed repeatedly.\n\nNice Touches:\n\n— The popouts in the rocker panels for attaching a jack.\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nThe numbers\n\nBase price: $81,100\n\nPrice as tested: $94,360\n\nHorsepower/Torque: 302 hp/339 lb/ft.\n\nWheelbase/Overall length: 99 inches/177.1 inches\n\nWidth/Height: 71.3 inches/51.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,121 lbs.\n\nSeating: 2 passengers\n\nSOURCE: Manufacturer",

      "expert_review": "Even though it is not as cheeky as the little SLK, the other Mercedes-Benz roadster, the SL series is an eminently enjoyable two-seater loaded with luxury and panache.\n\nSLs come in three flavors — 320, 500 and 600 — and their powerplants range from a six for the 320 to a V12 for the 600. I drove an SL equipped with a 5.0-liter V8 engine and the optional Sport package of 18-inch wheels and more aggressive front and rear spoilers designed by AMA, a German after market tuner with close ties to Mercedes. This package adds $4,900 to the already hefty base price of $89,900, putting the total price on par with a three-bedroom house in suburbia.\n\nWhile that is out of reach for the majority of us, the privileged folks who buy SLs don’t have to worry about the monthly payment or cost of insurance. To them, this car competes with summer homes or yachts.\n\nDecked out in white paint as stark as a refrigerator, with huge tires and ground-effects spoilers, our test car had the stance of a ballet dancer on steroids. Its muscles rippled, and it looked like it could gobble up the pavement without breathing hard. The Sport package looked a bit too conspicuous in white and I frequently caught people staring at me. If you prefer a lower profile, choose the standard model or else pick a dark color.\n\nTromp the throttle and the 315 horses respond with authority. It is clearly more of a high-speed touring car than a drag racer because it gathers speed elegantly, deliberately, as one would expect of a luxury car that weighs more than 4,000 pounds. On the highway it motors along with such assurance that you have to consciously reign it back to keep from zooming well past the speed limit.\n\nWhen I drove the SL500 the weather was still warm, and it was most enjoyable to drop the top, put up the windows, and motor. The wind-blocking screen that folds up behind the seats kills much of the turbulence that would otherwise buffet the passenger cabin.\n\nWhile the SL doesn’t have the razor-sharp responses, or punishing ride, of an all-out sports car, its handling is considerably sportier than a boulevard cruiser, due mainly to the prodigious grip of the high-performance tires and 18-inch wheels. When the pavement turns twisty and you have the top down, it is a joy.\n\nPutting the top down is absolutely painless. On the console there is a red knob that looks like a miniature model of the top. One touch is all it takes for the top to completely retract and fold itself under a hard cover. It only takes a few seconds for you to enjoy the freshness of top-down motoring.\n\nInside, leather abounds, and the seats are as comfortable as orthopedic shoes. The instrument layout is the same as every Mercedes, which is to say logical, readable and oriented toward making the driver’s job easy. Secondary controls for radio and climate control can be a tad cryptic, but are easily figured out.\n\nAn occupancy sensor in the right seat deactivates the passenger-side airbag when it detects less than 26 pounds in the seat.\n\nGiven this car’s price and stature, nearly every imaginable convenience item is standard, from 10-way electric seats to headlamp washers and a roll bar that pops into place in a third of second should you tip over.\n\nBoth front and side airbags are standard, as are traction control and anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe keyless remote vehicle security system uses infrared light so thieves cannot snatch the radio signals with a scanner.\n\nDriving at night was a joy because of the optional Xenon headlights, whose blue-white color illuminates the darkness much better than standard bulbs. At $950, they are an expensive option, but they last longer than regular lights and provide much better vision.\n\nIt has been 40 years since Mercedes-Benz introduced the first 300SL roadster, a car now hailed as a landmark classic. Whether the SL500 will fall into the same category remains to be seen, but it has ea ed a respected place in the company’s history.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $89,900. Extra-cost items included a CD changer, Xenon headlamps and the Sport package. The sticker price was $98,510.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The SL500 is a classic roadster with the refinement of a luxury sedan and the performance of a grand touring car. The automatic top is painless and the seats are as comfortable as your favorite pair or shoes.\n\nCounterpoint: The Sport package enhances handling but also made me feel conspicuous. For a lower profile, choose the regular model and add the bigger wheels.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.0-liter V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 99.0 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,165 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $89,900\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $98,510\n\nMPG RATING: 15 city, 23 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "I used to chuckle at Mercedes-Benz drivers. To me, the sight of the cars either meant a rolling midlife crisis or something comparable to a weekend duffer bringing a $6,000 set of clubs to the public golf course. I mean, do you reallllllly need all that?\n\nNow, after having driven a string of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, I’ve become one of those motorists I used to laugh at. It must be some kind of Mercedes virus — either that, or prolonged exposure to the automaker’s luxury loaded cars prompts a bizarre addiction to the point where you find yourself saying things like, “What, no navigation system in this one? How gauche!”\n\nAt any rate, those who long for Mercedes’ storied engineering happily have many choices — from the merely pricey to the obscenely expensive. Here’s a look at the models I have sampled from the Mercedes lot:\n\n2001 C240 sedan\n\nIt’s a cute little five-passenger model from the C-Class. Oh, and it’s a steal in Mercedes terms with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $29,950.\n\nOh, sure, it has a comparatively humble 2.6-liter V-6 (168 horsepower), but it’s loaded with enough standard goodies to put your American-luxury-car-owning neighbors to shame. Leather seating inserts, wood interior trim, auto-dimming mirrors, stop-on-a-dime four-wheel disc brakes and front/rear crumple zones are just a few of the perks.\n\nThe V-6, by the way, more than handles what the local roadways dish out (sequential multipoint fuel injection helps, of course), and the C240 can be dressed up with various four-figure options to make it a more-worthy road warrior.\n\nEven with the base $29,950 version, you still get top-drawer M-B engineering, and the technicians at the elegant Mercedes-Benz service centers give you the same attention as those drivers bringing in six-figure-priced machines.\n\nPeople prowling for an entry-level Mercedes will have more to cheer about soon as the C-Class Coupe reaches American shores in numbers. That will be a bargain-basement offering among Mercedes vehicles, starting around $26,000.\n\n2001 S55 AMG sedan\n\nTo be precise, it’s a five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase (121.5 inches). But it’s a light year removed from the C240, with the “AMG” designation being the tip-off. AMG is M-B’s high-performance division, and in the S55, that translates to a 5.5-liter V-8 laying down 354 horsepower and 391 pounds/foot of torque (at only 3,000 revolutions per minute).\n\nThe standard package also includes an active suspension, ultra-fancy 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker premium Bose sound system with CD changer, 14-way power-adjustable front seats and a power telescoping steering wheel.\n\nAnd there’s the pleasure of watching a sports-car-driving wacko disappear in your rearview mirrors when you apply the power to your classy looking family sedan.\n\nPlease note, this kind of S-Class pleasure c osts $99,645 on the bottom line. That’s with zero options, a $645 destination/delivery charge and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\n2001 S600 sedan\n\nStill trying to digest that sticker price on the S55? What’s the big deal?\n\nHere’s another S-Class five-passenger sedan with a long wheelbase, but with a 362 horsepower V-12 and a navigation system, the sticker price jumps to $115,945.\n\nPutting a right foot deep into an accelerator hooked up to a V-12 is an experience every motorist should experience at least once. It almost makes the drawbacks worth it. Those would be fear of parking within 10 feet of other vehicles, insurance bill terror and an overwhelming urge to rush outside every five minutes to see if anyone has put a ding in your car.\n\nOne other thing: The car has so much on it that it will take you at least three months to master every tech goodie explained in the owner’s manual.\n\n2002 SL500 coupe\n\nHere we g Much more reasonable. This SL-Class coupe/roadster carries two passengers and starts at only $83,800.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. This is a rich person’s toy. You’re 100 percent correct, and what a toy it is! Nothing stirs the automotive journalist’s soul like having momentary possession of a vehicle utterly beyond the reach of his income.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to pay the fare, the SL500 package includes a 302-horsepower V-8, independent damper struts on the front, rain-sensitive windshield wipers, headlight washer/wipers and a security system that does everything but write up an arrest report on the prospective offender.\n\nThrow in an extra $2,500 for a “Silver Arrow Edition” option, and you get amenities such as a bulletproof silver paint job, a six-CD changer and six-spoke wheels so dazzling that sunglasses are mandatory equipment for viewing.\n\n2001 CL600 coupe\n\nThis is the ultimate in the Mercedes-Benz test-model lot. The mother lode. The Holy Grail.\n\nThe four-passenger coupe with a 362 horsepower V-12, the full range of techno goodies and a 600-pages-plus owner’s manual that only those with advanced degrees in automotive engineering will fully understand starts at $117,200.\n\nMy test model was dressed up with perks that included a tire pressure-monitoring system, an electronic trunk closer, “Distronic” adaptive cruise control (which automatically adjusts for distance between vehicles while in cruise control) and AMG-added enhancements that brought the bottom line to $127,895.\n\nTo be honest, the entire time I had this test model I lived in fear of runaway shopping carts and no-look lane changers. Motorists with more money and bravery than I should know that this coupe represents just about the highest level of current automotive evolution.\n\n2001 CLK320 cabriolet\n\nAh, a nice way to finish our tour — a delightful four-passenger droptop with a comparatively easy-to-take MSRP of $48,900.\n\nGetting those two passengers into the back of the CLK320 might be a neat trick, but virtually everything else on this joy ride pleases. Handling for a low-range-priced Mercedes was outstanding. The softtop with a 215 horsepower V-6 held high-speed turns better than the new-for-2002 Lexus SC 430, which starts at $58,455.\n\nGolden State motorists who like to take that dream Big Sur coastal drive on Highway 1 south of Monterey take note: This might be the best car out there for that trip.",

      "expert_review": "In the rarified air of super-expensive, ultra-luxurious, V-12 powered luxury coupes, few names match the prestige of the Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG — and even fewer cars can match its combination of massive power and coddling appointments.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s SL roadster is one of those rare, iconic models that has endured for decades. It’s been a fixture of the Hollywood cognoscenti since its initial appearance in 1954; even Frank Sinatra owned one. The latest version has been redesigned for 2013, and it’s more than just a face-lift. The whole structure has been reworked, so the car is now fashioned almost entirely out of aluminum, and clocks in significantly lighter than the previous model. That describes the car that AMG — Mercedes-Benz’s in-house, high-performance-tuning organization — got its hands on before adding all its special go-fast bits. Once AMG was done, the result was the most expensive, most powerful car Mercedes-Benz sells: the SL65 AMG. It is indeed “King of the AMGs,” with a twin-turbocharged, 6.0-liter V-12 pumping out massive horsepower and torque, and wrapped in aluminum, leather and carbon fiber. Changes from the previous SL65 are extensive, but the powertrain itself is only mildly revised. As there was no 2012 version of the SL65, see the differences between 2011 and 2013 models here.\n\nStyling\nThe look of the new 2013 SL is an evolution of the previous model. It’s still long, low and wide, but now it features the more dramatic Mercedes-Benz face that’s becoming common across the range. The style is certainly distinctive, but not necessarily beautiful, with a high front end (meant to accommodate European pedestrian-safety laws) that gives it a squared-off look up front, and a muscular rear end that’s meant to imply big power coming through the rear wheels. The AMG treatment gives it some more aggressive elements, such as massive black chrome 19-inch wheels up front and 20-inch wheels out back, red-painted brake calipers, and an optional carbon fiber trim package that’s most visible in the side mirrors and trunklid spoiler. My tester also included special Magno Alanite Grey paint, a semi-gloss satin finish that is increasingly the rage among super-expensive sports cars. It looks quite good on the SL65, too.\n\nHow it Drives\nThe SL65 AMG has something very few cars on the planet have these days: a V-12 engine. Always the hallmark of a luxury vehicle (given the fuel thirst and maintenance costs that often accompany such motors), it appears here in the top-of-the-line SL roadster, and it is a stunning piece of work. The twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter engine makes 621 horsepower and 738 pounds-feet of torque. That’s almost as much torque as you get in a Ford Super Duty Power Stroke Diesel or Ram 2500 pickup with the Cummins turbo-diesel engine, but nestled in an aluminum roadster with huge performance tires.\n\nSlide into the cockpit and press the starter button, and the V-12 fires to life with a rumble and little drama. The exhaust note from all those cylinders is surprisingly unimpressive — it sounds precise, mechanical, but subdued even under full throttle. It doesn’t at all sound like Mercedes-Benz’s snarling 6.2-liter V-8 that appears in the SLS AMG; that engine will shake the trees and scatter small children with its roar. The SL65 instead prefers to go about its business of accelerating you to warp speed with minimal fuss and fury, letting the effect of all that torque do the talking. With a 3.9-second zero-to-60 mph time, warp speed is indeed an accurate analogy, blurring the world around you in a scary rush. Make sure the way in front of you is clear before you plant your foot, as you’ll run out of room quickly.\n\nHandling is precise, if not terribly athletic. Despite the aluminum construction, this is still a fairly heavy car, and given the SL’s pedigree, it’s much more of a luxury grand tourer than a true track star. Steering effort and transmission behavior are selectable, but for most conditions, keeping it on the comfort end of the spectrum, as opposed to the sport end, will keep you and your passengers most satisfied. The SL65 is meant to be quick, but given its deeply luxurious appointments, open roof and scary sticker price, it’s not meant to be raced. Just use it as a passenger-frightening device, pointing the car at the horizon and achieving super-legal speeds with astonishing swiftness.\n\nWith such a big engine and a propensity for seeing just how fast it can go, fuel economy suffers. The official EPA rating for the SL65 is 14/21/17 mpg city/highway/combined. Unfortunately, that means it gets hit with a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax, but if you’re already spending at least $212,000 on the car, that’s probably not a concern. My long-range driving test (from Ann Arbor, Mich., to St. Louis) saw the roadster average a quite-respectable 20 mpg. Not bad considering all the top-down driving I did over 1,200 miles.\n\nInterior\nInside, the SL65 is a rich mix of classy materials, bold shapes, genuine wood, leather, carbon and aluminum, all bolted together with uncompromising quality. It feels special in here, with a surprising amount of room for two (there is no rear seat) seated on thick, quilt-stitched leather. The seats are heated, cooled and highly adjustable, featuring Mercedes-Benz’s so-called massage feature — which is really only various bladders inflating and deflating, feeling more like someone pushing you in the back than actually massaging you. Call me when Mercedes-Benz incorporates a Brookstone rolling shiatsu massage chair into a roadster — that’s a massage function I could get behind.\n\nThe side bladders are part of the active seat feature that helps brace you when you change direction, responding to what the vehicle is doing. Some find it a good assist; I found it annoying. Thankfully, it is easily switched off.\n\nSome of the gee-whiz technology in Mercedes-Benz’s top roadster truly is impressive. The hardtop, which descends quickly into the trunk under a hard tonneau cover, features a glass panel roof that is actually one large LCD. Mercedes-Benz calls it Magic Sky Control. At the touch of a button, the entire glass roof darkens or goes transparent, letting less or more sun shine through. A function called Air Scarf directs a flow of hot air from behind the seats onto passengers’ necks, enabling comfy top-down cruising in cooler temperatures.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe SL65 features nearly all of Mercedes-Benz’s top technologies, including Bluetooth, smartphone compatibility and the mbrace2 multimedia app system. Everything is controlled though a knob selector in the center console; the large screen in the dashboard is not a touch-screen. Operating the system does take some getting used to, but most operations go smoothly once you’ve got it down. Navigation is standard on the SL65, but the map needs an update. Driving through northern Ohio and suburban St. Louis revealed relatively new major four-lane interstate highways that had not yet made it onto the Benz’s map, prompting the nav system to tell us we were zipping through a cornfield at 75 mph.\n\nThe Bang & Olufsen premium audio system is superb, as one would expect in such a high-dollar conveyance. The car is designed in such a way that it uses the open cavities in the structure behind the dashboard as a subwoofer enclosure, allowing for seriously deep bass response and very high-quality sound.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn the cabin, there are only a few cubbies and storage areas for carrying small items. The center console storage is rather lacking due to the vehicle’s driveline running between the passengers. Trunk storage comes in two stages: top up and top down. Top up, one can easily store a large suitcase or a few smaller roll-aboard cases, or a couple of golf bags. To put the top down, you have to lower a special locking divider into place that cuts cargo room in half but protects the top from impacting anything in the trunk. If the divider isn’t locked into place, the top won’t go down. The partition diminishes cargo room to two roll-aboard cases and some stuffed-in odds and ends, but it’s still plenty of room for two people and a weekend getaway.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 SL65 AMG has not yet been crash-tested. Crash-test ratings will be posted here once they become available. See standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe base price for the SL65 is $214,445, which includes a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax and $905 destination charge. My test car added $3,950 for the special Magno Alanite matte paint, $1,000 for red-painted brake calipers, $500 for upsized black chrome wheels and $3,570 for an exterior carbon fiber trim package, bringing the grand total to $223,465.\n\nIf one insists on a 12-cylinder engine and convertible top, competitors are more numerous than one might suspect. The most direct competitor may be the Bentley Continental GTC, which starts at $221,225 and features a W-12 engine, all the luxurious trappings present in the Benz and seating for two more people. While the price is similar, the performance is not — the Bentley is down 54 hp from the SL65 and does not feature the aluminum-intensive construction, meaning it weighs a whopping 1,200 pounds more than the SL65. Aston Martin has the $201,525 DB9 Volante convertible, also sporting a V-12 engine but still not nearly as powerful as the SL65’s torque-monster. The shape is arguably more attractive, however, and being 250 pounds lighter than the SL65 may offset a little of that power deficit. A third, somewhat-less-conventional choice could be the Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet. It doesn’t feature a 12-cylinder engine like the others, but power is still quite formidable, as are handling and overall performance. Motivated by a turbocharged flat-six that’s still not as powerful as the SL65’s V-12 (if you haven’t gotten the idea by now, it’s an insanely powerful engine), the Porsche is a significantly smaller and lighter car, besting the Benz by nearly 650 pounds. See how the competitors stack up here.\n\nIt’s difficult to talk about value when discussing a car that costs as much as a single family home in a Midwestern city. The bigger question is one of customer satisfaction. If you have this much money to spend on an automobile and are intent on doing so, is this a good choice versus other vehicles costing similar amounts? The answer to that question is yes. The SL65 AMG feels unique. It’s an understated grand touring roadster that delivers huge capability without the questionably flashy taste of some competitor coupes.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "If you’re Calvinist in nature, a two-seater with a house-size price tagseems like a ludicrous consideration. After all, a small sedan is only 12K.Why spend 10 times that to get where you’re going?\n\nIf you feel that way, stop reading right here.\n\nWhy? No words can possibly describe the sheer joy involved in driving suchan extravagant piece of automotive machinery as the Mercedes SL500. This is adream machine, an automobile that evokes envious glances and long stares. Itmakes one an instant celebrity of sorts. Certainly, you’ll appreciate — orbecome appalled — as people wave at you, shout at you, and offer themselvesas a passenger.\n\nWho can blame them? SLs have always been beautiful cars, and 1996’sfacelift of headlights, fog lamps and tail lights along with body-colorbumpers and rocker panels only enhance the look. Of course, the big chromeMercedes star sitting in the middle of the blacked-out grille captures theaudacity of this car perfectly.\n\nJust in case you’d like to know, the SL comes in three flavors. The”entry-level” SL320 features a 229-horsepower 3.2-liter in-line six and a baseprice of $78,300. Next up is the SL500, the tested car, with a 5-liter315-horsepower V-8 and $89,900 base price. The top-of-the-line SL600 with a389 6-liter V-12 is yours for a base price of $120,100. All three coupes arecoupled to a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nNeedless to say, no matter which number is on the deck lid of your SL,there’s sufficient power. But more of it never hurts. Just be careful backingout of the garage for the first time in your SL500 — you can get to 60 mph bythe end of your driveway. This car dishes out the speed effortlessly, thefive-speed making the shifts so smoothly you’ll never notice them. The SL500has a new engine management system and a distributorless ignition this year.\n\nNew also for ’96 is ESP, the Electronic Stability Program. When ESP detectsa wheel slipping from its intended track, it applies the brakes on the wheelthat’s slipping. Additionally, it features sensors that measure yaw, steering,wheel speed, lateral acceleration and brake pressure, and integrate thatinformation with anti-lock brakes and traction control systems. So what doesall this technology do? Makes you a much better driver than you are.\n\nRiding on huge Dunlop 18-inch tires, this car’s behavior is flat, whetheraccelerating, braking or going through corners. Handling is neutral andfeedback is good, slightly more insulated than a BMW, but easier to live withon a daily basis. Even at insane speeds on public roads, most drivers neverwill fully tap the performance potential of this car.\n\nAll convertibles shake over bumps, and even though this Mercedes did a lotless than most, it still exhibited some.\n\nIf you do get in over your head, Mercedes has you covered. Dual airbags arestandard. New side airbags are standard as well. Seat-belt tensioningretractors that tighten in a crash are standard . ABS and traction control arestandard. Additionally, if sensors detect an impending rollover, an automaticroll bar pops up and locks in place in a third of second.\n\nWhile you’re speeding down the road, you’ll note the cabin is a veryhospitable place to spend some time. The seats are big and wide, yet stillhold one in place while carving up corners. They’re also supportive and firm,not so rock-like as some previous Benzes. The dash is familiar to any lover ofthe three-pointed star. The gauges are large and easy to read, although themiles-per-gallon gauge is almost mocking as it swings down to the 10-mpgrange.\n\nThe automatic climate control and audio controls are improved over earliercars and prove easy to figure out. Memory seats help prevent arguments and theventilation system filters out dust and pollen. This car features cupholders(!) and decent storage in the armrest and center console. There is no glovebox, but there is a small slot above the center vents. The de ck behind theseats features storage, and the trunk is big enough for two moderately stuffedgolf bags.\n\nThe top is fully automatic and works at the touch of a button. As itunlatches the top from the windshield and begins to fold down, the windowslower, the roll bar retracts and the storage compartment lid opens to acceptthe folding top. As passers-by gawk, the top folds into the compartment, itslid closes and the windows roll back up. There. All set for motoring alfresco.\n\nWind noise is minimal, lower than in most sedans with the sunroof open. Aremovable aluminum hard top is standard (which explains the soft tops plasticrear window).\n\nThe Mercedes keyless entry works two ways, locking doors, trunk and gas capwith the top up, and locking all compartments when the top is down. Theinfrared signal can be hard to aim, but it’s harder for high-tech car thievesto copy. Its frequency changes each time it’s used. Additionally, enginemanagement is disabled if someone decides to help themselves to your car.\n\nOver the top? Sure. Any complaints?\n\nOnly one.\n\nI wish it were mine.\n\nMercedes SL500Standard: 5-liter double overhead cam 32-valve V8, five-speed automatic,acceleration slip control, 225/ 55ZR16 tires with alloy wheels, automaticclimate control with dust filter, 10-way power seats with seat, mirror andsteering wheel memory, infrared remote locking and trunk release, AM/FM/weather band/cassette six-speaker Bose audio system, leather upholstery andburl walnut trim, power windows with express down, electronically adjustablesteering column, beverage holders, floor mats, removable hardtop, dualairbags, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, anti-theft system with enginedisabler, headlamp washer/wipers, automatic pop-up roll bar, central locking,power black soft top.Optional: Sport package (specific trim, 18-inch monoblock wheels)Base price: $89,900Gas guzzler tax: $1,000As tested: $97,280EPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highwayTest mileage: 18 mpg",

There are two other, higher-priced models, the SL500 with V-8 power, and the SL600, with its awesome V-12 power plant. As for those prices, if you have to ask . . .\n\nPristine versions of the 300SL from the ’50s can be found at collector-car auctions around the globe, with bidding in the quarter-million-dollar range. But this is today, and Mercedes’ solid, satisfying grand tourer remains a top-drawer ride.\n\nIts appearance was freshened for ’96, and carries over to ’97, a lovely shape that should look as good in the distant future as it does now.\n\nThe biggest change for ’97 is a five-speed automatic transmission, which was introduced on its higher-priced brethren for ’96. For those of you who doubt the need for the extra gearing, consider this: it’s a smaller, lighter transmission that improves gas mileage 7 percent and requires 40 percent fewer parts to build.\n\nIt’s smart, too, electronically controlled to automatically match up shifting patterns with the driver’s style and adjust shifting for hill climbing or descent.\n\nDuring a great drive to Prescott, on the back roads through Wickenburg and Yarnell, the SL soared happily up the steep grades and hunkered down into the turns. On sharp hairpins, the 2-ton car felt heavy with some body sway, but that’s part of the trade-off for its silky ride.\n\nWhat would have been nice is a stick shift, which Mercedes doesn’t provide for the U.S. market.\n\nIn many ways, I prefer the feeling of the six-cylinder, an engine that harks to the vintage heyday of the racing 300SLs. The bigger engines make this car into something of a luxury barge.\n\nStill, in this incredible price range, you have to wonder about the performance limitations of the inline six, especially when the competition among two-seaters includes the V-10 Dodge Viper at thousands less and Chevrolet’s Corvette at about half the price.\n\nObviously, Mercedes’ reputation for solid engineering, plus the ego factor, come into play here. Some significant features of the SL320:\n\n– Side-impact air bags.\n\n– An automatic roll bar that pops up if the electronic sensors detect an impending rollover.\n\n– A fully automatic convertible top that is as entertaining to watch fold up or down as it is convenient.\n\n– An Electronic Stability System that works in conjunction with the anti-lock brakes and traction control to help prevent skidding.\n\n– A remote locking system that uses an infrared light beam instead of a radio signal to thwart high-tech thieves.\n\nPampered pass engers in the leather-bound and wood-trimmed interior of the SL will find it roomy and comfortable, withadjustable power seats and a fine stereo, something that’s been lacking in the past.\n\nMercedes-Benz has another, smaller, sportier two-seater waiting in the wings, the supercharged SLK roadster, that is expected to go on sale for about $40,000 when it hits showrooms this fall.\n\nMercedes-Benz rests its towering reputation on solid, reliable machinery and recently is tuning up its image in a more sporty direction. The SL320 stands up to the the test on both counts.\n\n1997 Mercedes-Benz SL320\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel-drive. Base price: $78,300 Price as tested: NA. Engine: A 3.2-liter inline 6 that has 228 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 232 pound-feet of torque at 3,750 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic. Curb weight: 4,010 pounds. Length: 176 inches. Wheelbase: 99 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city, 24 mpg highway. High points: Solid ride, handling. Five-speed automatic. Great to be seen in. Low Points: Scary price tag. Six-cylinder limitations. No stick shift available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter 12 years in its previous form, a massively restyled, posh Mercedes-Benz SL500 two-seat convertible went on sale as an early 2003 model. Unlike the prior SL-Class, which had a fabric top, the 2003 version was equipped with a retractable hardtop. At the push of a button, the car can transform from a roadster to a watertight coupe in 16 seconds.\n\nNew electronic brake control retained hydraulic components but had no mechanical link to the brake pedal. Its operation is electronically controlled and varies brake pressure to each wheel based on vehicle dynamics and other constantly monitored conditions. Variable brake proportioning can apply added pressure to the outside wheels in order to enhance safety when braking in turns. The system can sense wet conditions and react to emergency situations.\n\nThe SL500 gets a new seven-speed-automatic transmission for 2004. Active Body Control is an active suspension system that virtually eliminates body roll. An Electronic Stability Program is also standard. Occupying the luxury end of the sports-car realm, the SL-Class competes against the Jaguar XK8 convertible, the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet and the cars in Aston Martin’s lineup.\n\nSeveral months after the emergence of the SL500, a high-performance SL55 AMG edition went on sale. At the 2003 North American International Auto Show, Mercedes-Benz unveiled an SL600 convertible equipped with a bi-turbo V-12 engine. (Skip to details on the: SL55 AMG | SL600)\n\nExterior\nAn evolution of the previous-generation SL-Class roadster, the 2003 SL500 changed substantially in appearance with styling touches reminiscent of SLs of the past. The automaker said clear-glass xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights were considered a “more dynamic variation on the familiar ‘twin-headlamp’ theme” and an “intelligent” tilting mechanism ensured the roof retracted into the upper section of the trunk.\n\nSlippery in shape, the SL500 has a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Substantial aluminum content is used to keep body weight light.\n\nInterior\nLeather, fine wood and aluminum greet the two occupants of an SL500. Matte chrome surrounds the four separate chronometer-styled instruments on the dashboard. Distronic “intelligent” cruise control is optional. Cargo capacity is 7.3 cubic feet with the top down and 10.2 cubic feet when the top is up.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 302-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 engine powers the SL500. It is connected to a new seven-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nEach door is equipped with side-impact airbags designed to protect occupants’ head and thorax. Automatic rollover bars pop up within 0.3 second when the system senses an impending rollover.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe luscious SL500’s many features, such as the super-supportive seats, are enticing. Other than a slight hesitation when starting off and downshifting, the powertrain produces quick and energetic responses. Like all Mercedes-Benz models, the SL500 has a heavy feel, but it’s far less bothersome in this car.\n\nThe SL500 is highly stable on the road. It clings securely to the pavement and has excellent steering-wheel feel and appropriate effort. All told, it’s more boulevard cruiser than hard-core sports car, and it delivers outstanding ride comfort.\n\nThe controls range from cryptic to ambiguous. Mercedes-Benz’s navigation system is next to useless — the small screen becomes almost invisible in daylight. Hooded, finely calibrated gauges, on the other hand, are reasonably easy to read. Trunk space is skimpy due to intrusion from the retractable hardtop.\n\nRelated Model: SL55 AMG\nWith a 5.5-liter supercharged V-8 engine that produces 493 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque, the SL55 AMG is the fastest production Mercedes-Benz ever manufactured. Its five-speed-automatic transmission has SpeedShift buttons on the steering wheel. Racing-derived brakes are installed, and other components have been adapted to work with the higher engine output.\n\nMercedes-Benz claims the SL55 AMG roadster can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, versus a more leisurely 6.1 seconds for the SL500.\n\nDistinctive AMG bumpers and side skirts highlight the SL55 AMG, which features 18-inch five-spoke wheels and a quartet of chromed exhaust pipes at the rear. The SL55 AMG’s interior features aluminum trim that has a sand-cast effect and special sport seats. Back to top\n\nRelated Model: SL600\nIntroduced as a 2004 model, the SL600 holds a 5.5-liter V-12 that produces 493 hp at 5,000 rpm and 590 pounds-feet of torque as early as 1,800 rpm. Its five-speed-automatic transmission incorporates TouchShift operation for manually selected gear changes. Though engine output is the same in both the SL600 and SL55 AMG, the automaker says the SL600 differs in “character”; its power delivery is more refined.\n\nThe same brakes are used in the SL600 and SL55 AMG. Five-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels are installed. A chrome grille and subtle “V12” badges identify the SL600. Nappa leather on the active ventilated seats comes in five colors. An integrated digital phone is standard.\n\nMercedes-Benz has somehow managed to combine ferocity and luxury in the SL600, which flaunts a noticeable exhaust note along with its posh occupant fittings. Tromp the gas pedal while standing still and the SL600 lunges forward with a triumphant burst of power. Response is no less dramatic when pushing the throttle at higher speeds. SL600 drivers will likely feel confident when the need to pass or merge arises.\n\nThe seats are snugly bolstered. Few cars are more plushly upholstered than the SL600, which features masterfully stitched leather that cradles the two occupants. Rich-looking wood on the console and doors rounds out the interior.\n\nSerious luxury also shows through in the SL’s compliant suspension. The ride is far smoother than in a typical sports car. A wind blocker helps when the top is down, but some buffeting may occur, regardless.\n\nIs it excessive? Of course it is, but at least the SL600 delivers an enjoyable form of automotive excess.

      "expert_review": "Of all the cars, trucks and minivans I have test driven this past year, few vehicles evoked as many envious comments from co-workers as the new Mercedes-Benz SL500.\n\nOf course, this is an $86,000 car savored by few – mostly CEOs and entertainers. So its glamorous image is enough to attract a lot of attention.\n\nBut it’s not just image that will turn heads. This couple has stunning good looks. Voluptuous curves and crisp accent lines help hide the car’s wide stance and the more than 4,000 pound curb weight. Its size isn’t intimidating, like the Chevrolet Corvette, yet it is large enough to avoid looking like a toy. It has a modern appearance that matches the BMW Z8 for sheer eye appeal.\n\nThat feeling is backed up by the 5-liter V-8, which moves this coupe with a graceful air and throaty roar. Power is better approaching highway speeds than off-the-line. This coupe will not snap your head back upon initial acceleration, and with a 0-60 mph time of just 6.1 seconds, you won’t notice the car’s heft.\n\nWhere you will notice it is in the handling.\n\nThe car has a heavy, hunkered down feel that takes driving to a divine level. While you will get some road feel through the suspension, there’s little in the car’s steering or brakes.\n\nPart of this is due to the car’s electronic brake system. The system features anti-lock and disc brakes on all four wheels. A computer is used to sense your intentions by monitoring each wheel and the driver’s application of the brakes. Emergency braking is free of the shudder usually associated with anti-lock brakes. Stopping was exceptional.\n\nIn addition, Mercedes’ Active Body Control helps provide compromise between a smooth ride and sporty handling. The result works most of the time, but it’s easy to confuse the computer. This lends an unsettled feel to the car’s body lean as the computers try to decide what to do.\n\nThe stylish interior matches the SL500’s exterior.\n\nTwin bucket seats had the usual Mercedes hardness, yet they were supportive. Some passengers complained about their rather narrow width, so if you’re broad in the beam, this car may be uncomfortable.\n\nStill, this car does its best to coddle passengers.\n\nLeather and wood trim abound. The automatic climate control uses seatbelt sensors to judge how many passengers are in the car and adjusts the system accordingly. Other niceties include a Bose 10-speaker audio system, navigation system, and heated and cooled seats.\n\nOf course, the biggest thrill is the retractable hardtop, which brings on smiles in a brisk 16 seconds. Mercedes has even figured out a way to retain a decent amount of trunk space.\n\nWhile the Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a welcome addition to any CEO’s garage, and its engineering is quite remarkable, too many people buy the car for one reason only: the star on the front of the hood.\n\nWhich explains the catty comments, as well as the envious stares.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe SL-Class retractable-hardtop roadster competes in the upper-crust sport-luxury market with the likes of the BMW 650i and Jaguar XK convertibles. It seats two people and is offered in V-8-powered SL550 and SL63 AMG forms.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe SL65 AMG has been discontinued, but there are no significant changes to the remaining models.\n \nExterior\nThe front is characterized by angular headlights that look a bit sinister, a grille bisected by a single, bold cross-member and a large Mercedes star logo. The hood is domed and creased to carry the line from those shapes. An optional Intelligent Light System for the headlamps has five modes for different driving situations. In addition to the more common active (swiveling) and cornering light modes are Country mode, Motorway mode and enhanced fog lamps. Exterior features include:\n\nPower retractable hardtop\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels on SL550\nStandard 19-inch alloy wheels on SL63 AMG\nStandard bi-xenon headlights\nOptional Intelligent Light System\n\nInterior\nThe SL has leather-trimmed seats for two and a long list of comfort and convenience features to justify its lofty price, including the Comand multimedia system. Comand has an optional Universal Consumer Interface — a port that accepts portable music players and flash memory and controls them through the stereo, complete with on-screen menus. Also included are Bluetooth phone functionality and the option of watching DVDs on the screen (when the car is parked).\n\nAn interesting option is Airscarf — two small fans incorporated into each head restraint that blow warm air at the occupant’s neck. Mercedes says the objective is to “extend the open-air driving season.” Interior features include:\n\nmbrace telematics system\nVoice-activated Comand system with 8-inch dash screen\nBeverage cooler in glove box\n10-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe SL550 has a 382-horsepower, 5.5-liter V-8. The SL63 AMG’s 6.2-liter V-8 makes 518 hp. All versions are rear-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\nSeven-speed automatic transmission\nStandard active suspension system (Active Body Control)\nOptional Direct Steer system\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags\nDriver’s knee airbag\nPop-up roll bar\nActive head restraints",

      "expert_review": "After a dozen years, it’s almost time to bid the SL adieu.\n\nNot that the SL is disappearing from the Mercedes-Benz lineup. Rather, the next generation of the prestigious two-seat roadster, with styling influenced by the concept SLR unveiled on the auto-show circuit two years ago, is set to arrive in March as a 2003 model.\n\nIn preparation for that all-new SL, we tested an old one, the 2002 SL500 roadster dressed in limited-edition Silver Arrow finery.\n\nAs with almost any Mercedes, it’s a pleasure to slip behind the wheel of this two-seater. Solidly bolted together. No squeaks, rattles or vibrations–softtop up or down or removable aluminum hardtop fastened in place.\n\nWhile you don’t expect a Mercedes to shake or shimmy, be advised the SL feels heavy in the wheel. In part that’s by design to give the motorist the perception of rock-solid safety. More pounds equal more protection.\n\nOf course, the SL feels a bit heavy in the wheel largely because it weighs two tons plus 125 pounds.\n\nThis is no featherweight that will be tossed around on the road. Goes where you want when you want. You just have to turn the wheel a tad more firmly to ensure when you want.\n\nThe 5-liter, 302-horsepower V-8 responds well to pedal input, but thanks to those two-plus tons, the mileage rating is a scant 16 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway. The uplevel SL600 comes with a 6-liter, 389-h.p. V-12 that’s quicker off the line yet gets only 13/19.\n\nAs a result of its 16/23 m.p.g. rating, be prepared to hand over $1,000 in gas-guzzler tax for the pleasure of owning the SL500 ($2,600 for the SL600).\n\nOf course, with a base price exceeding $80,000, why would you quibble about a $1,000 tax, especially if you don’t quibble about choreographing the four-wheel equivalent of a sumo wrestler on the roadway?\n\nSL500 mileage is like that on many SUVs, but when last we looked, no consumer interest or environmental groups were trying to legislate the SL off the road.\n\nPerhaps that’s because Mercedes sells only about 5,000 of these things each year, down from 7,500 annually in the late ’90s as some buyers have opted to wait for the all-new ’03 version.\n\nMercedes doesn’t say much about the ’03, other than it will come with a retractable hardtop like that on the small Mercedes SLK roadster instead of the current power softtop and removable aluminum hardtop that takes two to fasten/unfasten and store.\n\nLike all Mercedes, the SL500 is loaded with safety hardware, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and Brake Assist (if you don’t hit the pedal hard enough to activate the ABS in a panic situation, the sensors do it for you), electronic stability control to combat slipping or sliding, front- and side-impact air bags, a BabySmart system that detects whether a child is or isn’t in the passenger seat when a special Mercedes child seat is used to keep the air bag from deploying a nd a roll bar that pops up if sensors detect the vehicle is tilting.\n\nThere also are dual front and side-impact air bags. While just about every Mercedes air-bag system comes with sensors to regulate deployment speed based on impact severity, this SL lacks that. The ’03, however, will have the more sophisticated air bags.\n\nCreature comforts include automatic climate control with a dust filter, AM/FM stereo with cassette, power seats with driver-side memory settings for mirrors and steering column, power windows and locks, rain-sensing wipers and tilt and telescoping steering column.\n\nYou also get a Tele Aid emergency communication system that uses global positioning satellites to pinpoint your location so it will not only locate you in a mechanical or medical emergency, it can track down the car if stolen. When the medical problem is only minor, the SL, like all Mercedes, comes with a first-aid kit.\n\nThe SL500 starts at $83,800. With the retract e hardtop coming for 2003, you can be sure that will rise.\n\nTo the $83,800 you must add $2,500 to convert the SL500 into a Silver Arrow, a lot of dough for such things as silver paint and birds-eye maple interior trim, but you also get an aluminum briefcase.\n\nOnly question potential buyers have to ask themselves is whether the image and prestige of the Mercedes SL is worth $83,000 plus, or will they settle for an equal amount of image and prestige from the Lexus SC430, which comes with a retractable hardtop, has an extra–though very small–rear seat, starts at more than $25,000 less than the SL, and isn’t burdened with a gas-guzzler tax.\n\nThe folks at Mercedes surely are asking the same question, don’t you think?",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2006 about the 2007 Mercedes-Benz SL550. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nYou’ve seen the ads — the ones where the happy couple runs outside to find a luxury car with a bow on top in their driveway. While I’m not holding my breath waiting to find a set of keys to a Mercedes-Benz SL550 under the tree this year, maybe you are. If that’s the case, you’ll be among the fortunate few who possess one of these retractable-hardtop roadsters. It’s an amazing car in many ways, and one we were sad to see leave the Cars.com garage.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe basic shape of the SL-Class has been around since the 2003 model year, and it remains one of Mercedes-Benz’s most stunning designs. Low and wide, the SL550 doesn’t follow other cars on the road, it stalks them. Mild trim changes for 2007 include new chrome-ringed fog lamps and new taillights. The front fenders and hood are accented with silver-colored strakes.\n\nThe SL550’s retractable hardtop can lower in about 13 seconds, and it’s something to watch as the hydraulic system transforms the car from an all-weather touring car into a roadster. Though the fabric roofs of newer soft-top convertibles look fairly graceful, it’s hard to beat the sleek coupelike silhouette of a retractable-hardtop convertible. Front and rear parking sensors are optional.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe SL550 has a four-wheel independent suspension that features Mercedes-Benz’s Active Body Control active suspension technology. The hydraulic system is designed to eliminate body roll, acceleration squat and brake dive, and includes a Sport mode. I drove the SL550 on many different kinds of surfaces — smooth and rough asphalt, concrete highways, muddy logging trails (just kidding, Mercedes) — and found much to like about the roadster’s ride quality.\n\nBody roll is nearly nonexistent in the SL550. Switching between normal and Sport modes didn’t alter my seat-of-the-pants impressions, though Mercedes-Benz claims the Sport setting further reduces roll and firms up the shocks. Big bumps can make the car hop sideways ever so slightly, but the suspension — though firm — never lets the ride become harsh.\n\nEven though the SL550 has fairly light steering effort for a sports car, the speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion system’s telepathic responses and road feel won me over. The wide 18-inch tires sometimes tug at the wheel when driving on rutted roads, but the setup is otherwise hard to fault.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nIt’s easy to love the SL550’s 5.5-liter V-8. New for 2007, the easy-revving engine makes 382 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 391 pounds-feet of torque at a low 2,800 rpm. It delivers waves of effortless power at any speed drivers are likely to encounter in the U.S. Mercedes-Benz says the sprint from zero to 60 mph takes 5.3 seconds.\n\nWith so much power on tap not far off idle, I can understand why the seven-speed automatic transmission — which includes a Comfort mode that starts the transmission in second gear (to lower engine rpm when accelerating on slick roads) and a Sport setting that starts it in first — has been programmed to upshift rapidly through the gears as the car gains speed; even in the higher gears the engine manages to pull strongly. However, I think Mercedes went a bit overboard. Though the quick upshifts can save fuel and make for quieter operation, they sometimes leave the engine bogged down in too high of a gear when rapid acceleration — or just a not-so-cheap thrill — is needed. To avoid this, I found myself using the automatic’s clutchless-manual mode more than I do in most cars just to keep the engine’s abundant power available.\n\nThe front vented and cross-drilled brake discs measure nearly 14 inches in diameter and are squeezed by four-piston calipers. The rear discs measure 12.6 inches across. It takes a day or two to get used to the sometimes nonlinear pedal response of the electrohydraulically actuated brakes, which at times provide immediate stopping performance but can also startle the driver. There were occasions when I pressed the pedal and nothing happened until I pushed it farther down — not a sensation you want when you’re piloting a six-figure sports car through heavy traffic.\n\nThe Inside\nSliding into the driver’s seat requires clearing a substantial chrome door sill. It’s also a bit difficult to extract yourself from the car, but no more so than in other sports cars.\n\nThough it’s not cramped, the SL550’s two-person cockpit is definitely intimate. I’m 6-foot-1 and was able to get comfortable in the car, but could tell I was nearing the constraints of the cabin when attempts to move the driver’s seat farther backward resulted in the backrest tilting forward without my help.\n\nMy test car had the optional dynamic multicontour seats, which include all sorts of fancy adjustments, like a power height-adjustable head restraint, power-adjustable side bolsters, a power-extendable seat cushion and a massage setting. These seats have firm cushioning and are highly supportive. They’re covered in soft leather, as are the steering wheel, dashboard, center console and doors. Hand-polished wood trim is standard. Overall, it’s a beautifully crafted space.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s Comand navigation and audio system is standard and features a dash-mounted information screen. Instead of a touch-screen interface, selections are chosen via buttons on the side of the screen that correspond to the current menu. I didn’t find it as intuitive as competing touch-screen systems, but it should help prevent the screen from getting fingerprints and smudges on it. Dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel are standard. Adaptive cruise control and a fixed glass roof with a sunshade are optional.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have crash tested the SL550, and it’s unlikely either will in the near future, given that it is a low-volume model. Standard safety features include antilock brakes with brake assist, side-impact airbags in the doors, a driver’s knee airbag, a popup roll bar, and an electronic stability system.\n\nCargo\nThere’s a respectable 10.2 cubic feet of cargo room with the top up, and lowering the hardtop only takes away about 3 cubic feet of room. The trunk features a movable divider that shows how much luggage you can safely pack without intruding on the space reserved for the stowed roof panels when the top is down. A power trunklid is optional. Though the roof panels take up trunk space when lowered, they can motor upward when the lid is opened, allowing access to the space below the divider. Some retractable hardtops trap cargo underneath the lowered roof.\n\nSL550 in the Market\nEven in this rarified market segment, the SL550 faces plenty of competition from sports cars like the Cadillac XLR retractable-hardtop roadster and soft-top models like the Jaguar XK convertible and upcoming Aston Martin V8 Vantage roadster. The only thing that really dampens my enthusiasm for this model is its troubled reliability history, because a service department waiting room is no place to be when you own a car like this.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "There is something distinctly epochal about the Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG, the twin-turbocharged, 12-cylinder, 604-horsepower version of the company’s quantum-luxury roadster. More powerful than the Ford GT and quicker than a Ferrari 360, the SL65 – an SL600 with gene-doping enhancement by AMG, the company’s tuner division – feels like a final, conflict-ending fusillade in the decade-long horsepower wars.\n\nWhat comes after a car like this? More horsepower? I don’t think so. While it’s certainly possible to wring more horsepower out of an emissions-legal gasoline engine, such pursuits grow increasingly expensive and irrelevant, if not vain and silly. The SL65 is less than a second slower to 60 mph than a 650-horsepower Ferrari Enzo (3.3 seconds) – and that single second, that fig leaf of numerical superiority, costs about a half-million dollars more (assuming you could buy an Enzo at anything like its $680,000 MSRP).\n\nThe long-awaited Bugatti Veyron, a million-euro hyper-car built under the auspices of parent company VW Group, promises nearly 1,000 hp out of its quad-turbo W16 engine. But it looks to be a rather feckless enterprise; with its complex drivetrain (seven speeds, multiple differentials and all-wheel drive) the 4,300-pound car will not be quicker than the 3,000-pound Enzo, though if it manages to stay on the ground its top speed will probably be higher.\n\nThe horsepower wars are, at base, psychological warfare. It’s purely academic if the 400-hp Cadillac CTS-V is faster than the 500-hp BMW M5 (it isn’t), since both cars are horridly fast enough. You may indulge your pet theories about men and their sexual compensations and I, for one, wouldn’t argue – though I might cross my legs.\n\nExtreme sports cars justify their ludicrous cost only by a few tenths of a second measured by some car magazine, and yet here the field seems to be reaching a natural equilibrium – they can all make the green-light dash in around 4 seconds; they can all turn a quarter-mile in about 12 seconds; and they can all cruise at 200 mph if they happen to be crossing the U.A.E. with one of the emir’s sons on board. In this category, you will find cars like the Porsche Carrera GT, Ford GT, Lamborghini Murcielago (3.6 seconds); and a handful of rare isotopes with names like Koenigsegg, Pagani and Mosler.\n\nSo where is the value of these cars when an SL65 can stalk them? All of these ground-bound rockets are purpose-built from lightweight, hard-to-spell metal alloys and carbon composites. The all-steel SL65 weighs 4,473 pounds and is, in its bones, the same chichi chariot seen tooling around Bel-Air, a courtesan cruiser. Its long-as-your-arm list of standard features includes a retractable hardtop, five-speed automatic transmission, air-conditioned and heated seats with massage function, surround-sound stereo, DVD navigation, even a climate-controlled glove box.\n\nThe SL65 goes from a standstill to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, clears the quarter-mile traps in 12 seconds and only then does it find its stride in a jubilant, wind-cleaving roar. In the time it takes to read aloud this paragraph, the car will go from zero to its electronically limited top speed of 155 mph.\n\nWhat’s that feel like? Ask the guy in the funny helmet who gets shot out of a cannon.\n\nYou can almost feel sorry for exotic cars. Stuffing more horses in the corral won’t help.\n\nAmong the limiting factors: street tires. The SL65’s bi-turbo V12 is a veritable Vesuvius of torque – 738 pound-feet between 2,000 and 4,000 rpm – yet the trick is converting all that driveshaft twist to acceleration. If you nail the throttle in the SL65 (traction control turned off) the rear wheels simply boil off a few hundred dollars of exotic Italian rubber (even with its relatively high rear-end ratio of 2.65:1, which favors top-end speed over hole-shot quickness). You could increase the width of the tire or reduce the water-channeling grooves – increasing the overall “contact patch” – but you only make the tires louder, less compliant in ride quality and less secure in wet conditions. You could make the rubber compound softer and more adhesive but then the tires would wear rapidly.\n\nAll-wheel-drive divvies up engine torque among four wheels, but given the additional driveline weight and complication a car may actually go slower, as in the case of the Veyron. Also, highly strung engines require more cooling airflow, which complicates high-speed stability. Monster torque at the output shaft requires a transmission that can handle it. Again, more weight, more complication. These are the sorts of where-the-lines-cross considerations automotive engineers make all the time.\n\nAnother limiting factor: durability. There are import tuners out there who are getting 500 horsepower out of their turbocharged four-cylinder Mitsubishi Evos – once, maybe twice, before they grenade in a shower of exotic particles.\n\nManufacturers, on the other hand, can’t simply set their engines to kill. They have warranties to serve and reputations to protect. Each SL65 engine – a 6.0-liter, 36-valve, all-aluminum unit also found under the hood of the CL65 – is hand-built by a senior technician at the AMG factory in Affalterbach, Germany, whose signature is engraved on a plaque atop the carbon-fiber engine cowling. It’s the automotive equivalent to artisan cheese. The engine’s innards include a high-strength forged steel crankshaft, reinforced main bearings, titanium connecting rods, forged aluminum pistons, an oversized oil pump, auxiliary oil cooler and all sorts of clever plumbing to make sure the oil sprays around inside the engine like suds in a car wash. The fire is provided by phased twin-spark ignition with twin ignition coils per cylinder, the fuel-by-fuel injectors computer-controlled for each cylinder, and the air by two bowling-ball-sized turbochargers.\n\nThe amazing thing is not that this engine rocks the seismograph like a square-dancing Godzilla, but that it carries Mercedes’ usual 4/48 warranty.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of emissions. It will become increasingly difficult – which equals expensive – to wage the horsepower wars as standards tighten. As it is, the SL65 isn’t exactly Kermit green, and it will only return its EPA-rated 12 miles per gallon city, 19 mpg highway if you don’t start it.\n\nAMG performance upgrades include outrageously large and powerful compound brakes, ultra-cool 19-inch composite alloy wheels, up-rated suspension hardware and software, special front air dam with black-mesh grille coverings, intakes and heat extractors, as well as an AMG quad exhaust that broadcasts the engine’s deep, unearthly sound, like Tibetan throat singing.\n\nEnd-of-history arguments are treacherous. But it seems to me the awesome SL65 marks a kind of roll-credits moment for the gas-and-steel automobile. Mercedes itself has announced it will follow Lexus in building hybrid-electric luxury cars, and Lexus execs will happily tell you their goal is not so much efficiency as performance. There is even a Toyota Prius “GT” out there somewhere. One nice thing about electric traction motors is peak torque is available at any speed. Also, it would be easier to maximize grip under acceleration with electric motor-driven wheels. A smarter traction control, if you will.\n\nIt will be a while before the SL65 is obsolete in any fundamental sense. But at some point – 10 years, 20 years from now – I think we might look back on this car as the highest and most artful example of a doomed technology, like the Curta mechanical calculator, the tube Marshall amplifier or the Denon direct-drive turntable. Each of these items still has its collectors and aficionados, so it wouldn’t surprise me to see an SL65 still on the road, a magnificent anachronism.\n\n*\n\nAutomotive critic Dan Neil can be reached at dan.neil@latimes.com.\n\n*\n\nMercedes-Benz 2005 SL65 AMG\n\nBase price: $179,720\n\nPrice, as tested: $192,340\n\nDrivetrain: 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged and intercooled V12, single-overhead cam, three-valve-per-cylinder, alloy block and heads, phased twin-spark ignition, computer-controlled fuel injection at each cylinder; five-speed adaptive transmission with manual-shift; 2.65:1 rear drive ratio; rear-wheel drive\n\nChassis: Active suspension, with independent multi-link front and rear suspension, coil springs in series with active electro-hydraulic springs, gas-pressured shocks\n\nHorsepower: 604 at 5,500 rpm\n\nTorque: 738 pound-feet at 2,000 to 4,000 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 4,473 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 4.2 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 100.8 inches\n\nOverall length: 178.5 inches\n\nWheels: Composite alloy, 8.5JX19 front, 9.5JX19 rear\n\nTires: High performance 255/35 ZR19 front, 285/30 ZR19 rear\n\nEPA mileage: 12 miles per gallon city, 19 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: Guns and butter",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter 12 years in its previous form, a wholly restyled Mercedes-Benz SL500 two-seat convertible went on sale as an early 2003 model. Unlike the prior SL-Class, which had a fabric top, the 2003 version was equipped with a retractable hardtop. At the push of a button, the car can transform from a roadster to a watertight coupe in 16 seconds.\n\nNew electronic brake control was used. Variable brake proportioning could apply added pressure to the outside wheels to enhance control when braking in turns.\n\nSoon after the emergence of the SL500, a high-performance SL55 AMG edition went on sale. Then came an SL600 with a bi-turbo V-12. An even stronger SL65 AMG with a 604-horsepower, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 capable of reaching 60 mph in 4.2 seconds debuted for the 2005 model year.\n\nThe SL500 got a new seven-speed-automatic transmission for 2004. An Electronic Stability Program and Active Body Control — an active suspension system that virtually eliminates body roll — are standard.\n\nRun-flat tires are newly optional on 2006 models. New 18-inch double-spoke wheels are included with the AMG Sport Package. The SL-Class competes against Aston Martin models, the Jaguar XK8 and the Porsche 911.\n(Skip to details on the: SL55 AMG | SL600 | SL65 AMG)\n\nExterior\nIntroduced for 2003, the SL500 was an evolution of the previous-generation SL-Class roadster, and it changed substantially in appearance. Styling touches were reminiscent of SLs of the past. The automaker said clear-glass xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights were considered a “more dynamic variation on the familiar ‘twin-headlamp’ theme.” An “intelligent” tilting mechanism ensures that the roof retracts into the upper section of the trunk.\n\nAluminum is used to keep body weight down. The slippery-shaped SL500 has a 0.29 coefficient of drag.\n\nInterior\nLeather, fine wood and aluminum are used in the SL500’s interior. Matte chrome surrounds the four separate chronometer-styled instruments on the dashboard. Cargo capacity is 7.2 cubic feet with the top down and 10.2 cubic feet when the roof is up. Distronic adaptive cruise control is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 in the SL500 mates to a seven-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStandard side-impact airbags are designed to protect an occupant’s head and thorax. A driver’s side knee airbag is installed. Automatic roll bars pop up within 0.3 seconds when the system senses an impending rollover.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLike all Mercedes-Benz models, the SL500 has a markedly heavy feel, but it’s less bothersome in this car than in some others. The SL500 has many enticing features, such as super-supportive seats. The powertrain produces quick and energetic responses after slight hesitation when starting off and downshifting.\n\nHighly stable on the road, the SL500 clings securely to the pavement. Though heavy-feeling overall, it delivers excellent steering response with appropriate effort. All told, the SL500 is more boulevard cruiser than hard-core sports car, and it delivers outstanding ride comfort under most conditions.\n\nControls range from cryptic to ambiguous. Mercedes-Benz’s navigation system is next to useless; the small screen becomes almost invisible in daylight. Its hooded, finely calibrated gauges, on the other hand, are reasonably easy to read. Trunk space is skimpy due to intrusion from the retractable hardtop.�\n\nSL55 AMG\nThe SL55 AMG is equipped with a 5.5-liter supercharged V-8 that produces 493 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. This car was the fastest production Mercedes-Benz ever manufactured until it was overtaken by other AMG variants. Its five-speed-automatic transmission has SpeedShift buttons on the steering wheel. Racing-derived brakes are installed, and other components have been adapted to work with the higher engine output.\n\nMercedes-Benz claims the SL55 AMG can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, versus a more leisurely 6.1 seconds for the SL500.\n\nDistinctive AMG bumpers and side skirts highlight the SL55 AMG, which features five-spoke 18-inch wheels and a quartet of exhaust pipes at the rear. The interior features special sport seats and aluminum trim. Back to top�\n\nSL600\nIntroduced as a 2004 model, the SL600 holds a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-12 that produces 493 hp at 5,000 rpm and 590 pounds-feet of torque as early as 1,800 rpm. Its five-speed-automatic transmission incorporates Touch Shift operation for manually selected gear changes. Though engine horsepower is identical in both the SL600 and SL55 AMG, the automaker says the SL600 differs in character; its power delivery is more refined and exhibits greater torque output.\n\nThe same brakes are used in the SL600 and SL55 AMG. Five-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels are installed. A chrome grille and subtle “V12” badges identify the SL600. Nappa leather on the active ventilated seats comes in a choice of colors. An integrated digital phone is standard. Keyless Go, a heated steering wheel and corner-illuminating fog lamps are standard on the 2006 SL600.\n\nMercedes-Benz managed to combine ferocity and luxury in the SL600, which flaunts a noticeable exhaust note and posh occupant fittings. Tromp the gas pedal while standing still and the SL600 lunges forward with a triumphant burst of power. Response is no less dramatic when pushing the throttle at higher speeds. SL600 drivers will likely feel supremely confident when passing and merging.\n\nFew cars are more lavishly upholstered than the SL600, which features masterfully stitched leather that cradles its occupants. The seats are snugly bolstered. Rich-looking wood on the console and doors rounds out the interior.\n\nSerious luxury also shows through in this SL’s compliant suspension. The ride is far smoother than in a typical sports car. A wind blocker helps when the top is down, but some buffeting may occur regardless.\n\nIs it excessive? Of course it is, but at least the SL600 delivers an enjoyable form of automotive excess. Back to top�\n\nSL65 AMG\nIf an SL55 AMG simply won’t suffice, Mercedes-Benz also offers a super-potent SL65 AMG version. Rather than a measly 493 hp, the SL65 AMG is equipped with a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 that cranks out a whopping 604 hp and 738 pounds-feet of torque. That’s sufficient to deliver a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.2 seconds.\n\nHand-built at the AMG engine facility by a single specialist, the V-12 is signed by that craftsperson. The SL65 AMG is the first Mercedes/AMG product to be fitted with a limited-slip rear differential. AMG wheels hold 19-inch tires. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "A fast luxury cruiser with the driving style of a top-down sports car, the Mercedes-Benz SL enjoys a long tradition of combining upscale comfort with a subtle blend of silky performance.\n\nThe SL Class traces its lineage back more than a half century to the 1954 300SL Gullwing coupe, a race-bred classic that gave rise to the 300SL convertible in 1957. Today, these are primo collector’s items.\n\nFor 2009, Mercedes-Benz tunes up its premium roadster with some styling tweaks that reflect the heritage of those early 300SLs and show off Mercedes’ latest design trends.\n\nSL550, along with its high-performance variations, loses the organic front-end look of the past few years in favor of harder-edged headlights and a bolder grille that incorporates a huge tri-star emblem. The side vents behind the front wheels are more pronounced, and squared-off exhaust tips are integrated into the rear bumper.\n\nThe revisions create a more purposeful look, although some of SL’s distinctive style is ditched for a more mainstream design. Still, a great-looking machine that lets the world know you’ve arrived.\n\nThe retractable hardtop continues as a defining feature, with the test car including the optional glass moonroof. Its fabric sunshade is woefully inadequate under the Arizona sun.\n\nThe SL550 is the least powerful of the SL Class, with “only” 382 horsepower from its 5.5-liter V-8. That pales besides the SL600 with its 510-horsepower turbocharged V-12; the SL63 with a 518-horsepower V-8; or the real bad boy of the group, the SL65 AMG packing a 604-horsepower turbo V-12 and a price tag approaching $200,000.\n\nAll well and good, but the SL550 should be plenty for those wealthy drivers who can forego the bragging rights of the faster versions.\n\nMercedes-Benz SL550\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 5.5-liter V-8, 382 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 391 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Seven-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 100.8 inches.\n\nOverall length: 180.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,220 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 13 city, 21 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Beautiful styling, silky performance, advanced high-tech features.\n\nLOWS: Obnoxious headrests, heavy feel, especially pricey with almost $10,000 in options.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 5.5-liter V-8 launches the big roadster with a solid whoosh, hitting 60 mph in 5.3 seconds, Mercedes says. Speed freaks who want more must pony up even bigger bucks.\n\nThe seven-speed automatic, which electronically adapts to driving style, provides smooth performance and refinement.\n\nFuel mileage is poor enough to provoke a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Sharply maneuverable, with excellent steering and brakes, SL still feels too heavy. This is a 4,200-pound sports car, after all, and no amount of technology or engineering can hide that.\n\nMercedes should look at lightening the load for better handling and economy.\n\nNaturally, SL550 comes with an impressive array of high-tech safety and convenience gear. The revamped navigation/audio interface is much improved.\n\nSTYLING: Two parallel bulges in the hood and the various strakes and louvers evoke the style of the old 300SLs. That huge tri-star emblem seems a bit showy.\n\nINTERIOR: A luscious cabin with the scent of leather and wood, and it’s well insulated from the outside world. The mechanical workings of the retractable hardtop are visible, which seems weird in this range of price and sophistication.\n\nSL is rich with luxury and technological features, more than I can list here.\n\nI found the blocky headrests to be annoyingly uncomfortable.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Another beautiful SL that drives like a dream, guaranteed to be exclusive because of its scary price tag.\n\nBase price: $96,775.\n\nPrice as tested: $106,160.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nPremium package with multi-contour, ventilated seats; electronic trunk closer; Keyless Go, $3,750.\n\nPanoramic sunroof, $1,950.\n\nPremium leather seats and trim with leather-and-wood steering wheel and shifter, $1,510.\n\nGas guzzler tax, $1,300.\n\nShipping, $875.",

      "expert_review": "You’ve seen the ads — the ones where the happy couple runs outside to find a luxury car with a bow on top in their driveway. While I’m not holding my breath waiting to find a set of keys to a Mercedes-Benz SL550 under the tree this year, maybe you are. If that’s the case, you’ll be among the fortunate few who possess one of these retractable-hardtop roadsters. It’s an amazing car in many ways, and one we were sad to see leave the Cars.com garage.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe basic shape of the SL-Class has been around since the 2003 model year, and it remains one of Mercedes-Benz’s most stunning designs. Low and wide, the SL550 doesn’t follow other cars on the road, it stalks them. Mild trim changes for 2007 include new chrome-ringed fog lamps and new taillights. The front fenders and hood are accented with silver-colored strakes.\n\nThe SL550’s retractable hardtop can lower in about 13 seconds, and it’s something to watch as the hydraulic system transforms the car from an all-weather touring car into a roadster. Though the fabric roofs of newer soft-top convertibles look fairly graceful, it’s hard to beat the sleek coupelike silhouette of a retractable-hardtop convertible. Front and rear parking sensors are optional.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe SL550 has a four-wheel independent suspension that features Mercedes-Benz’s Active Body Control active suspension technology. The hydraulic system is designed to eliminate body roll, acceleration squat and brake dive, and includes a Sport mode. I drove the SL550 on many different kinds of surfaces — smooth and rough asphalt, concrete highways, muddy logging trails (just kidding, Mercedes) — and found much to like about the roadster’s ride quality.\n\nBody roll is nearly nonexistent in the SL550. Switching between normal and Sport modes didn’t alter my seat-of-the-pants impressions, though Mercedes-Benz claims the Sport setting further reduces roll and firms up the shocks. Big bumps can make the car hop sideways ever so slightly, but the suspension — though firm — never lets the ride become harsh.\n\nEven though the SL550 has fairly light steering effort for a sports car, the speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion system’s telepathic responses and road feel won me over. The wide 18-inch tires sometimes tug at the wheel when driving on rutted roads, but the setup is otherwise hard to fault.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nIt’s easy to love the SL550’s 5.5-liter V-8. New for 2007, the easy-revving engine makes 382 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 391 pounds-feet of torque at a low 2,800 rpm. It delivers waves of effortless power at any speed drivers are likely to encounter in the U.S. Mercedes-Benz says the sprint from zero to 60 mph takes 5.3 seconds.\n\nWith so much power on tap not far off idle, I can understand why the seven-speed automatic transmission — which includes a Comfort mode that starts the transmission in second gear (to lower engine rpm when accelerating on slick roads) and a Sport setting that starts it in first — has been programmed to upshift rapidly through the gears as the car gains speed; even in the higher gears the engine manages to pull strongly. However, I think Mercedes went a bit overboard. Though the quick upshifts can save fuel and make for quieter operation, they sometimes leave the engine bogged down in too high of a gear when rapid acceleration — or just a not-so-cheap thrill — is needed. To avoid this, I found myself using the automatic’s clutchless-manual mode more than I do in most cars just to keep the engine’s abundant power available.\n\nThe front vented and cross-drilled brake discs measure nearly 14 inches in diameter and are squeezed by four-piston calipers. The rear discs measure 12.6 inches across. It takes a day or two to get used to the sometimes nonlinear pedal response of the electrohydraulically actuated brakes, which at times provide immediate stopping performance but can also startle the driver. There were occasions when I pressed the pedal and nothing happened until I pushed it farther down — not a sensation you want when you’re piloting a six-figure sports car through heavy traffic.\n\nThe Inside\nSliding into the driver’s seat requires clearing a substantial chrome door sill. It’s also a bit difficult to extract yourself from the car, but no more so than in other sports cars.\n\nThough it’s not cramped, the SL550’s two-person cockpit is definitely intimate. I’m 6-foot-1 and was able to get comfortable in the car, but could tell I was nearing the constraints of the cabin when attempts to move the driver’s seat farther backward resulted in the backrest tilting forward without my help.\n\nMy test car had the optional dynamic multicontour seats, which include all sorts of fancy adjustments, like a power height-adjustable head restraint, power-adjustable side bolsters, a power-extendable seat cushion and a massage setting. These seats have firm cushioning and are highly supportive. They’re covered in soft leather, as are the steering wheel, dashboard, center console and doors. Hand-polished wood trim is standard. Overall, it’s a beautifully crafted space.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s Comand navigation and audio system is standard and features a dash-mounted information screen. Instead of a touch-screen interface, selections are chosen via buttons on the side of the screen that correspond to the current menu. I didn’t find it as intuitive as competing touch-screen systems, but it should help prevent the screen from getting fingerprints and smudges on it. Dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel are standard. Adaptive cruise control and a fixed glass roof with a sunshade are optional.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have crash tested the SL550, and it’s unlikely either will in the near future, given that it is a low-volume model. Standard safety features include antilock brakes with brake assist, side-impact airbags in the doors, a driver’s knee airbag, a popup roll bar, and an electronic stability system.\n\nCargo\nThere’s a respectable 10.2 cubic feet of cargo room with the top up, and lowering the hardtop only takes away about 3 cubic feet of room. The trunk features a movable divider that shows how much luggage you can safely pack without intruding on the space reserved for the stowed roof panels when the top is down. A power trunklid is optional. Though the roof panels take up trunk space when lowered, they can motor upward when the lid is opened, allowing access to the space below the divider. Some retractable hardtops trap cargo underneath the lowered roof.\n\nSL550 in the Market\nEven in this rarified market segment, the SL550 faces plenty of competition from sports cars like the Cadillac XLR retractable-hardtop roadster and soft-top models like the Jaguar XK convertible and upcoming Aston Martin V8 Vantage roadster. The only thing that really dampens my enthusiasm for this model is its troubled reliability history, because a service department waiting room is no place to be when you own a car like this.\n\nSend Mike an email",
