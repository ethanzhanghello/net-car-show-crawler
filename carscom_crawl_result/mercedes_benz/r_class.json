      "expert_review": "The closest thing to a minivan Mercedes-Benz is ever likely to build, the new R-Class is a six-passenger cross between a sport utility vehicle and a station wagon. From the side, it looks more minivan-ish than R-Class owners might like to admit. Inside, though, it’s all Mercedes.\n\nThe R-Class is the second product to come from Mercedes’ plant in Alabama, which was built to produce the M-Class SUV. Which it still does, and while the R-Class uses a few bits and pieces from the M-Class, it’s an entirely different vehicle.\n\nIn purpose, the R-Class is similar to the Chrysler Pacifica, in that both offer three rows of seats, two seats per row. You might think that since DaimlerChrysler owns Mercedes and Chrysler, the R-Class and the Pacifica might share some components. You would be wrong. The R-Class is a larger, heavier, more solid vehicle that is considerably more expensive: With the standard 3.5-liter, 268-horsepower V-6 engine, the Mercedes R350 starts at $48,775. The Pacifica, with its 3.5-liter, 250-horsepower V-6, starts at $25,895. The Chrysler is 198.9 inches long, and the R-Class is 203 inches long.\n\nEven so, seating in the third row of the R-Class is moderately tight and not particularly comfortable — best-suited for kids. The first two rows, though, have comfy captain’s chairs with plenty of room.\n\nThe test Mercedes was an R500, with a 5.0-liter, 302-horsepower V-8, and a seven-speed automatic transmission. With the vehicle’s eager, perceptive transmission, though, either engine is fine. I would be tempted to save the $7,500 difference between the two models, and with the V-6, you’ll pick up a little fuel mileage. The R350 is EPA-rated at 16 miles per gallon city, 21 mpg highway, while the R500 is rated at 13/18.\n\nYou get more than just a bigger engine with the R500 — a telescoping steering wheel, heated front seats, a six-disc CD changer and a couple of other features, but all stuff I can live without.\n\nEven with the R350, the list of standard features is a long one: All-wheel drive, side and side-curtain air bags, leather-trimmed upholstery, fog lights, alloy wheels and stability control.\n\nThe test R500 had plenty of options, though, including rear climate control, four-wheel air suspension, heated rear seats, a navigation system, rear parking sensors, Sirius satellite radio, an upgraded sound system and a “panoramic roof package,” consisting of two huge power sunroofs. All this, plus shipping, raised the $55,500 base price to $66,450. Even so, there are other options offered, such as a rear DVD player, an AMG sport package and a power liftgate.\n\nWeighing in just shy of 5,000 pounds, the R500 is much lighter on its feet than you would think. That’s due in part to excellent brakes and big P255/55R-18 tires, but it also feels as though the vast majority of that weight is carried very low in the vehicle. Even on tight turns, the R500 never feels tipsy like some SUVs. Or minivans. Or whatever this thing is.\n\nHighway cruising is exceptionally comfortable, with a smooth ride but still a semi-sporty feel for the road. The R500 is an excellent way to rack up the miles with minimal effort. Around town, it feels smaller than it is.\n\nInside, the R500 is a bit austere-looking, though all the requisite bells and whistles are in place. Workmanship seems as good as the Mercedes models from Germany, something that has not always been the case with the Alabama-built Benzes.\n\nThere are certainly cheaper ways to carry six people, but initial sales of the R-Class suggest that quite a few customers prefer their minivan — or SUV, or station wagon, or whatever it is — to carry a three-pointed star in the grille.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2011 about the 2011 Mercedes-Benz R350 Bluetec. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs family-haulers go, the Mercedes-Benz R350 Bluetec is a nice rig — perhaps too nice for the sippy-cup-and-Cheerios gang. Even though the R350 doesn’t fit nicely into a defined category such as minivan, SUV or crossover, it’s nonetheless a practical car for the high-earning, minivan-averse family.\n\nThe R350 caters to families with its roomy cabin, compliant ride and available convenience features, but it sacrifices some utility in the name of style.\n\nI tested the diesel-powered R350 Bluetec, and a gas V-6 engine is also offered. The diesel version starts at $51,740, but options made the as-tested price balloon to around $67,000. The R-Class’ price range overlaps two of Mercedes’ SUVs: the five-seat M-Class and the seven-seat GL-Class. The R-Class is available with seating for six or seven. To see a side-by-side comparison of these three models, click here.\n\nStyling\nRiding lower than a crossover but looking sleeker than a minivan, the R-Class might best be described as a large wagon. It’s nearly as long as Mercedes’ flagship S-Class full-size sedan, but wider and taller.\n\nThe front of the R-Class has been significantly updated for 2011. It features a new grille, new headlights and new bumper styling. Taken as a whole, the changes give the R-Class a stronger, more substantial look. It’s a big improvement, and it works well with the rest of the exterior design, which carries over mostly unchanged.\n\nRide & Handling\nOne of the best aspects of the R350 Bluetec is its comfortable ride. It can feel floaty on undulating roads and exhibits noticeable body roll when cornering, but the suspension tuning’s emphasis on comfort is the right choice for a people-mover like this.\n\nOn the highway, the R350 settles down nicely. It feels planted and would be an easy-driving steed on a family road trip.\n\nClassic Mercedes steering tuning yields limited feedback, which isn’t out of the ordinary for a luxury-oriented family-hauler. The wheel itself spins smoothly, and the moderate amount of effort required to turn it feels appropriate.\n\nDiesel Power\nAs if the R-Class’ styling didn’t make it unique enough, it’s also one of the few models in the U.S. with an available clean-diesel engine. The diesel V-6 is rated 25 percent better in EPA-estimated combined fuel economy than the gas V-6 engine, but as diesels are prone to do, it also makes more noise. All versions of the R-Class have all-wheel drive.\n\nI’ve been impressed with the immediate power delivery in many modern diesels, but you don’t get that feeling in the R350 Bluetec. The specs say the torque is there — 400 pounds-feet at a low 1,600 rpm — but it seems to arrive late. It’s not a problem on the highway, though, as the diesel has plenty of reserve power for passing.\n\nThe R-Class’ 210-horsepower, 3.0-liter diesel V-6 is clean enough to be sold in all 50 states. Mercedes’ Bluetec technology reduces diesel emissions by squirting a solution — AdBlue urea — into the exhaust gases. This process creates ammonia, which in turn changes up to 80 percent of nitrogen oxides (a pollutant that contributes to smog) into nitrogen and water, according to Mercedes. You’ll consume less fuel with the diesel V-6, too. It gets an EPA-estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway, whereas the gas-powered R-Class gets 15/19 mpg on required premium gas. The same diesel V-6 engine is also offered in the M-Class, where it’s rated 18/25 mpg, and the GL-Class, which returns 17/21 mpg.\n\nThe diesel R-Class costs $1,500 more than the base gas version, but the diesel’s greater efficiency should make up the price difference in a little more than two years, based on current fuel prices and assuming it’s driven 15,000 miles a year.\n\nThe Inside\nThere are some nice, high-grade materials in the R-Class’ cabin, but it’s showing its age and would have benefited from an update like the exterior received.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the cabin is the optional Comand system, which controls the navigation and audio systems, among other features. Unlike some other Mercedes models, including the S-Class and E-Class, that have the system’s controller knob on the center console, the R-Class utilizes a keypad on the dash. It’s a bit half-baked — and not nearly as easy to use.\n\nComfy front bucket seats are a plus, and the second row is downright huge; in terms of legroom and overall comfort, it’s as accommodating as an S-Class. Six seats in three rows are standard, but an optional seven-seat configuration adds a narrow seat between the second-row buckets.\n\nThe third row is roomy enough. I’m 6-foot-1, and I could sit back there with the second row scooted forward some.\n\nThere’s not much cargo room when all three rows of seats are up — 15.2 cubic feet, which is about what you’d get in a midsize sedan’s trunk — and that lack of space might make it hard to pack for a family road trip. You get considerably more room in a three-row minivan, like the Chrysler Town & Country (33 cubic feet) or Toyota Sienna (39.1 cubic feet). Folding the Mercedes’ third row yields 42.2 cubic feet of space, and there’s 85 cubic feet when both the second and third rows are down.\n\nSafety\nThe R-Class received a Good overall score — the highest rating possible — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. It hadn’t yet undergone IIHS’ new roof-strength test as of publication.\n\nStandard safety features include side-impact airbags for the first and second rows, side curtain airbags for all three rows, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, active head restraints for the front seats, and Pre-Safe. In the event of a likely collision, as determined by braking and stability system sensors, Pre-Safe cinches the seat belts and adjusts the position of the front seats for optimal occupant protection. A blind spot warning system is optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nR350 Bluetec in the Market\nOne look at Mercedes’ 2010 sales numbers is all you need to understand the R-Class’ niche status. In a year when the automaker’s midsize M-Class and full-size GL-Class SUVs sold around 30,000 and 20,000 copies, respectively, approximately 3,000 R-Class models left the lot. It’s a stark example of the SUV’s staying power in the U.S. market.\n\nThat said, if you’re considering a luxury SUV but might be willing to step outside the SUV box, you’ll probably find more to like in the R-Class than you think. It’s an eminently sensible SUV alternative — especially if you never venture off-road.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "As family-haulers go, the Mercedes-Benz R350 Bluetec is a nice rig — perhaps too nice for the sippy-cup-and-Cheerios gang. Even though the R350 doesn’t fit nicely into a defined category such as minivan, SUV or crossover, it’s nonetheless a practical car for the high-earning, minivan-averse family.\n\nThe R350 caters to families with its roomy cabin, compliant ride and available convenience features, but it sacrifices some utility in the name of style.\n\nI tested the diesel-powered R350 Bluetec, and a gas V-6 engine is also offered. The diesel version starts at $51,740, but options made the as-tested price balloon to around $67,000. The R-Class’ price range overlaps two of Mercedes’ SUVs: the five-seat M-Class and the seven-seat GL-Class. The R-Class is available with seating for six or seven. To see a side-by-side comparison of these three models, click here.\n\nStyling\n\nRiding lower than a crossover but looking sleeker than a minivan, the R-Class might best be described as a large wagon. It’s nearly as long as Mercedes’ flagship S-Class full-size sedan, but wider and taller.\n\nThe front of the R-Class has been significantly updated for 2011. It features a new grille, new headlights and new bumper styling. Taken as a whole, the changes give the R-Class a stronger, more substantial look. It’s a big improvement, and it works well with the rest of the exterior design, which carries over mostly unchanged.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nOne of the best aspects of the R350 Bluetec is its comfortable ride. It can feel floaty on undulating roads and exhibits noticeable body roll when cornering, but the suspension tuning’s emphasis on comfort is the right choice for a people-mover like this.\n\nOn the highway, the R350 settles down nicely. It feels planted and would be an easy-driving steed on a family road trip.\n\nClassic Mercedes steering tuning yields limited feedback, which isn’t out of the ordinary for a luxury-oriented family-hauler. The wheel itself spins smoothly, and the moderate amount of effort required to turn it feels appropriate.\n\nDiesel Power\n\nAs if the R-Class’ styling didn’t make it unique enough, it’s also one of the few models in the U.S. with an available clean-diesel engine. The diesel V-6 is rated 25 percent better in EPA-estimated combined fuel economy than the gas V-6 engine, but as diesels are prone to do, it also makes more noise. All versions of the R-Class have all-wheel drive.\n\nI’ve been impressed with the immediate power delivery in many modern diesels, but you don’t get that feeling in the R350 Bluetec. The specs say the torque is there — 400 pounds-feet at a low 1,600 rpm — but it seems to arrive late. It’s not a problem on the highway, though, as the diesel has plenty of reserve power for passing.\n\nThe R-Class’ 210-horsepower, 3.0-liter diesel V-6 is clean enough to be sold in all 50 states. Mercedes’ Bluetec technology reduces diesel emissions by squirting a solution — AdBlue urea — into the exhaust gases. This process creates ammonia, which in turn changes up to 80 percent of nitrogen oxides (a pollutant that contributes to smog) into nitrogen and water, according to Mercedes. You’ll consume less fuel with the diesel V-6, too. It gets an EPA-estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway, whereas the gas-powered R-Class gets 15/19 mpg on required premium gas. The same diesel V-6 engine is also offered in the M-Class, where it’s rated 18/25 mpg, and the GL-Class, which returns 17/21 mpg.\n\nThe diesel R-Class costs $1,500 more than the base gas version, but the diesel’s greater efficiency should make up the price difference in a little more than two years, based on current fuel prices and assuming it’s driven 15,000 miles a year.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThere are some nice, high-grade materials in the R-Class’ cabin, but it’s showing its age and would have benefited from an update like the exterior received.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the cabin is the optional Comand system, which controls the navigation and audio systems, among other features. Unlike some other Mercedes models, including the S-Class and E-Class, that have the system’s controller knob on the center console, the R-Class utilizes a keypad on the dash. It’s a bit half-baked — and not nearly as easy to use.\n\nComfy front bucket seats are a plus, and the second row is downright huge; in terms of legroom and overall comfort, it’s as accommodating as an S-Class. Six seats in three rows are standard, but an optional seven-seat configuration adds a narrow seat between the second-row buckets.\n\nThe third row is roomy enough. I’m 6-foot-1, and I could sit back there with the second row scooted forward some.\n\nThere’s not much cargo room when all three rows of seats are up — 15.2 cubic feet, which is about what you’d get in a midsize sedan’s trunk — and that lack of space might make it hard to pack for a family road trip. You get considerably more room in a three-row minivan, like the Chrysler Town & Country (33 cubic feet) or Toyota Sienna (39.1 cubic feet). Folding the Mercedes’ third row yields 42.2 cubic feet of space, and there’s 85 cubic feet when both the second and third rows are down.\n\nSafety\n\nThe R-Class received a Good overall score — the highest rating possible — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests. It hadn’t yet undergone IIHS’ new roof-strength test as of publication.\n\nStandard safety features include side-impact airbags for the first and second rows, side curtain airbags for all three rows, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, active head restraints for the front seats, and Pre-Safe. In the event of a likely collision, as determined by braking and stability system sensors, Pre-Safe cinches the seat belts and adjusts the position of the front seats for optimal occupant protection. A blind spot warning system is optional.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nR350 Bluetec in the Market\n\nOne look at Mercedes’ 2010 sales numbers is all you need to understand the R-Class’ niche status. In a year when the automaker’s midsize M-Class and full-size GL-Class SUVs sold around 30,000 and 20,000 copies, respectively, approximately 3,000 R-Class models left the lot. It’s a stark example of the SUV’s staying power in the U.S. market.\n\nThat said, if you’re considering a luxury SUV but might be willing to step outside the SUV box, you’ll probably find more to like in the R-Class than you think. It’s an eminently sensible SUV alternative — especially if you never venture off-road.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The last time I was in a Mercedes-Benz diesel I was 9 years old. My mom drove one. From inside my school classroom, I could hear her driving up the road; I could smell it from across the street. It was embarrassing to my 9-year-old self. Imagine my joy at discovering that the 2009 Mercedes-Benz R320 BlueTec diesel is not only quiet and odor-free, but kind to our planet, too.\n\nThe R-Class crossover is already close to becoming the ultimate luxury mom-mobile, and it’s glamorously green with its new diesel technology, too. Apparently, this is what all the eco-groovy Hollywood moms are driving. After spending a week in an R320 diesel, I’d be happy to join their ranks. If only…\n\nThe R-Class is a six- or seven-seat crossover with so much luxury and comfort inside that calling it a station wagon is just plain insulting. It’s a pretty, powerful and flexible crossover. While I wasn’t in love with Mercedes’ complicated Comand information system or the layout of the controls, I wasn’t annoyed enough to be happy to see this car go.\n\nDriving the R320 diesel is surprisingly pleasant. There’s none of that nasty noise or smoke that used to come with diesel engines. While this new diesel is a bit louder than its gasoline counterpart, the sound level isn’t annoying or that noticeable. In fact, I had to draw people’s attention to the R320 to get any sort of reaction to it. The diesel V-6’s sound is deeper and slower, but it’s easily within the normal range of engine noise. Another great improvement over my mother’s diesel car is the BlueTec engine has eliminated the dreaded diesel lag. The crossover’s acceleration seems heavy rather than quick, but it’s certainly powerful. It drives smoothly and steadily, and it handles curves and mountain roads without batting an eye.\n\nWhat’s really great about the R320 is its gas mileage and the eco-friendliness of the new diesel technology. The R320 gets an EPA-estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway. Even with my lead-footed driving through the mountains, I averaged 17 mpg, which is decent for a car this heavy. It’s not just the gas mileage that’s green, the additives to the exhaust system negate 99 percent of those icky greenhouse gases and particulates that used to come pouring out of diesels as black smoke.\n\nExterior\n\nI’m just going to say it: In black, the R-Class looks like a hearse. It’s not just me; I’ve heard this from lots of people. However, the R-Class is beautiful in a lovely Alpine Rain Metallic paint. A friend of mine called it “dreamy.” This isn’t your mama’s station wagon. It’s sleek, elegant, classy and all kinds of things that I’m not.\n\nThere’s great visibility thanks to the large windshield. The chrome grille is stamped with the famous three-spoked symbol, and the oval headlights recall the Mercedes-Benz of a bygone era. The R-Class’ tinted windows are trimmed with a thin band of chrome. A sleek ridge along the doors creates movement, and the standard 19-inch wheels bring authority to the R-Class. There’s enough chrome to add some sparkle and richness to the R320, but not enough to be gaudy or flashy. Everything is tasteful and elegant. Just stay away from the black one. It’s ominous.\n\nFrom the side, however, the R-Class looks like (forgive me for saying it) an elongated station wagon, but I wouldn’t call it unattractive. That elongation is what creates room for a fully functional third row that’s incredibly easy to get to because of the R320 diesel’s enormous rear doors. Honestly, these are the largest rear doors I’ve ever seen not attached to a limo. They’re huge! They open so wide that my kids struggled with them a bit, but loading an infant-safety seat is significantly easier when the door isn’t bumping you in the butt. Unfortunately, when little people fling those massive doors open, nearby cars are bound to suffer dings and indignities aplenty.\n\nI was impressed with all the room in the R320 BlueTec. Even with the third row in place, there’s plenty of space in the cargo area for a major grocery run. My test car didn’t come with the optional power liftgate, so I had to open it the old-fashioned way; the liftgate didn’t feel heavy and was easy to manage, if less fun than pressing a button.\n\nBecause the R-Class is a crossover – not an SUV – it doesn’t sit much higher than a sedan. There’s no climbing involved, unless you’re getting to the third row, and even that’s easy.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe R320 diesel’s interior is bright and luxurious. Large windows and a fabulous panoramic sunroof bring in the rays and offer great visibility. That panoramic sunroof is a $1,050 option, but it’s oh so worth it. It makes a rather long and solid car feel light and airy. A power sunshade can block out the sunlight at the touch of a button, but I loved having all that sunshine in the car and only closed it at high noon. It amazes me that the R320 is so quiet inside, even with all that glass. If I turned off the audio system, I could hear the engine. With music playing at modest volume, I heard nothing from the outside.\n\nWith several covered bins to contain all my gear and a terrific USB input for my iPod, I was a happy camper. I connected my phone to the Bluetooth system with no trouble at all, and the sound was crystal clear.\n\nThe test model I drove lacked some of the pricier bells and whistles, like satellite radio and a navigation system. While I didn’t miss the Siruis Satellite Radio or the nav system, I did wish for a backup camera. A backup camera is available in two different option packages, costing $5,350 or $7,850. Visibility is pretty good from most angles, but there just isn’t any way to see what’s directly behind you without a backup camera.\n\nThe R320 diesel’s many buttons on the center stack are within reach, but most of the car’s systems are controlled with the Comand system. It uses a large, multidirectional knob that’s surrounded by four “soft” buttons. The system takes some getting used to. Honestly, between the Comand system and all the buttons on the dash, I struggled with simple things like changing the radio station or turning down the air conditioning. So, I did what I rarely do; I opened the owner’s manual. Whoa, was that a mistake. The owner’s manual has esoteric pictograms that seem to have little or no relationship to their purpose, which is worse than the crossover’s rows upon rows of buttons.\n\nThere were a few things that bugged me about this car. The turn-signal stalk sits lower on the steering-wheel column than in most cars, and the stalk for the cruise control sits just above the area I’d expect the turn-signal lever to be. I often found myself engaging the cruise control rather than signaling an upcoming turn. It was particularly annoying because the turn-signal stalk is out of sight, hiding behind one of the steering-wheel spokes. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels great, and it has controls for the audio system, your cell phone and voice-control options. However, I ran into trouble with those buttons, too. If I didn’t press them firmly enough, nothing happened. If I pressed them too firmly, the horn honked and I looked like an idiot. I don’t like looking like an idiot.\n\nMost of the time, however, I enjoyed all of the R320 diesel’s comfort and luxury. The second-row seats are captain’s chairs that fit passengers of all sizes. It took awhile to get our high-back booster seat situated in the seat because the active head restraint kept getting in the way. We worked out a solution, but it took awhile. The seat belts were easy to use and fit my guys well. There are four sets of Latch connectors in the second and third rows, but they’re really buried and hard to get to.\n\nWhat wasn’t easy for them was the cupholders in the backseat. Rather than seat- or door-mounted cupholders, the R320 diesel sticks them near the floor on the back of the center console. You have to open a door and then fold the cupholders down; this isn’t feasible for someone strapped into a child-safety seat, and it’s too complicated for little fingers.\n\nIn the third row, the cupholders are set just below the windows and within reach. In fact, everything about the third row is easy, from the easy entry – the second row magically slides/folds/scooches out of the way – to the easy-to-use remote folding of the seats. Seriously impressive.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe R-Class has been named a 2009 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this honor, a car must receive the highest rating of Good in front, side and rear crash-tests and have stability control.\n\nThe R320 diesel also has Mercedes’ Pre-Safe automated collision-mitigation system, which quickly and automatically prepares the crossover for a crash by tightening seat belts, among other things. There are front-impact airbags for the driver and front passenger airbags and side-impact airbags in all three rows. Side curtain airbags also cover all three rows of seats.\n\nOn top of stability control, the R-Class has standard all-wheel drive, traction control – which is great on slippery surfaces – antilock brakes and a tire pressure monitoring system. This alerts you should a tire suddenly lose pressure. Even if you have a blow-out, you won’t get stuck changing a tire on the side of the road because the R320 diesel comes with run-flat tires.\n\nThe R-Class has a long list of optional safety features, including a backup camera and a blind spot monitoring system. There are rollover sensors and Trailer Stability Assist, in case you ever tow something behind the R-Class. The R320 diesel’s SmartKey never has to leave your pocket or purse, so there’s no fumbling in the dark for keys. However, there’s a panic button on the key fob should you feel the need.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Wide-opening doors make loading child-safety seats easy, as do the four sets of Latch connectors.\n\nIn School: The big, heavy doors guarantee lots of door dings, courtesy of little arms.\n\nTeens: The entertainment choices, as well as uber-comfy captain’s chairs, will please teens.",

The gasoline R350 and diesel R320 CDI continue on. Both offer seating for up to seven. The Lexus RX and Cadillac SRX are among the R-Class’ competitors. Introduced for the 2006 model year, Mercedes says the R-Class “grand sports tourer” is the company’s first model to blend the merits of a sport utility vehicle, sports sedan and luxury wagon.\n\nThe R-Class evolved from the Grand Sports Tourer concept of 2000. Marketers promote the R-Class for its style, sophistication and luxury.\n\nExterior\nFront and rear design cues are modeled after Mercedes-Benz coupes and sedans. Rounded and squat at the rear, the R-Class flaunts a relatively long profile, and all R-Class models have 18-inch wheels.\n\nThe unibody R-Class wagon is about an inch longer than Mercedes’ flagship S-Class sedan. Two distinct sunroofs are optional: a conventional glass panel or a double-sized panoramic unit with a 5-foot, 7-inch glass panel. When opening the panoramic sunroof, half of the panel moves atop the other so headroom isn’t affected. Powered roller blinds in this roof protect occupants from the sun.\n\nPrivacy glass is standard, and a single-lift tailgate is installed. The R-Class’ fully independent suspension uses double wishbones up front and a four-link setup at the rear. A load-leveling rear air suspension is standard, and the driver can select from three operating modes: Normal, Comfort or Sport. Dealer-installed roof rails are available.\n\nInterior\nThe R-Class provides space for up to seven occupants courtesy of three pairs of seats. Space between the first and second row measures 34 inches, with 30 inches between the second and third row. An optional second-row console contains additional cupholders, and bottle holders are located in each door pocket. The seats have leather inserts, and brown bird’s-eye maple wood trims the doors, dashboard and center console.\n\nThe four-spoke multifunction steering wheel features brushed-aluminum accents, and a new electronic gear selector is mounted on the steering column. The upper section of the two-tone dashboard arches over the instrument cluster, which holds two cylindrical binnacles for the speedometer and tachometer.\n\nWeather-band reception is included in the standard radio, which has a single-CD slot and controls for optional satellite radio. An auxiliary plug in the glove box connects to MP3 players. Optional flat-screen monitors built into the back of the front head restraints can provide entertainment for rear passengers.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.5-liter V-6 in the R350 develops 268 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The R320 CDI produces 221 hp and 398 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nAll the engines team with a seven-speed automatic. The transmission is able to skip as many as three gear ratios during downshifts to get the transmission in the proper gear. The R350 is now available with rear- as well as all-wheel-drive models.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags protect occupants in all three rows of seats, and door-mounted side-impact airbags for front occupants are standard. A rollover sensor can activate seat belt pretensioners and the side curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and an Electronic Stability Program are standard, and a tire pressure monitoring system is installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe refined, versatile, luxurious R-Class yields a lush ride even when surfaces get rough. Few drivers could ask for a more satisfying luxury tourer for long hauls.\n\nHandling is no less impressive. Steering feels just right for this new class of car, and it requires moderate effort with utterly satisfying response. The R350, with its V-6 engine, can scamper up grades almost as assertively, issuing only a little more engine noise.\n\nJust a touch of driveline and road sound is evident, but the engine is nearly silent unless pushed hard. A nest of headrests impairs the rearward view, which is otherwise OK and helped by ample mirrors. The seats offer magisterial comfort and support, are wholly adjustable to suit one’s physique, and remain appealing even after hours of driving. Reflections are evident in the steep windshield, but they’re not too distracting. Cylindrical gauges are big and easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz does not want you calling the R500 a minivan. Period.\n\nR500 is a “Grand Sports Tourer,” according to the German giant, and it represents a whole new breed of luxury craft designed to transport those of means in high style.\n\nFine. But despite not having sliding side doors, R500 has to be considered a minivan. Just like the similar Chrysler Pacifica from its fellow DaimlerChrysler brand and just like Cadillac SRX, another high-end vehicle with the same tall-wagon configuration.\n\nSo let’s just call it what it is. R500 is a minivan for the wealthy.\n\nThere should be no shame in being a minivan, the most practical, efficient and versatile people hauler on the planet. But minivans smack of domesticity, a relinquishing of style and sassiness, a tacit admission that, no, I’m no longer on the prowl.\n\nR500 suffers from none of those perceived flaws. It comes across more like an executive jet or a private yacht, an opulent symbol of success, but family-style. Sure, there are more expensive vehicles, especially among the Benzes, but R500 manages to combine practicality and excess under one glorious roof.\n\nYou can get a base model R-Class for about $48,000, the V-6-powered R350. But then, you’re not playing with the big dogs. The test R500, with its sparkling V-8 engine and superb drivability, came loaded up with a slew of options and crossed over into exclusive $70,000 territory, putting it among top-drawer sedans and SUVs. Here’s one minivan that won’t fade into traffic. And it should get plenty of attention for the kids when they’re dropped off for soccer practice.",
