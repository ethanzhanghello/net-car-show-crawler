      "expert_review": "Even as the auto industry transitions into electrification, AMG spinoffs follow the debut of a new Mercedes-Benz as surely as the moon follows the sun through the sky. And so it is not the least bit surprising — but still plenty delightful — that just five months after revealing the new CLE-class coupe and convertible, Mercedes is now announcing the 2024 AMG CLE53 Coupe.\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe and Cabriolet: 2 Become 1\n\nA quick refresher: The CLE is an all-new model in the Mercedes lineup, splitting the difference between the C-Class and E-Class. The latest-generation C-Class debuted for the 2022 model year, and a new E-Class is expected to be in dealerships soon.\n\nAggressive Styling\n\nWhile the CLE has a graceful, refined shape, the Mercedes-AMG CLE sports wider front and rear fenders, and its track widths grow 2.3 inches wider up front and a full 3.0 inches broader in the rear. Its unique front end sports a taller center intake flanked by two gaping inlets, while four large-caliber circular exhaust finishers punch through the rear fascia. An optional AMG Performance Studio Package adds more slatted vents, a more pronounced rear spoiler and a rear diffuser. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard; 20s are available. Four-piston brake calipers squeeze 14.6-inch rotors at the front, while single-piston clamps grab 14.2-inch discs out back.\n\nManiacal and Gratuitous Powertrain …\n\nThe 53 in this coupe’s name denotes that it’s powered by AMG’s 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine, which is fitted with a gas-driven turbocharger and an electric auxiliary compressor for quicker response. The powertrain produces 443 horsepower and 413 pounds-feet of torque, and an overboost function provides extra squeeze, juicing torque output to 443 pounds-feet for up to 12 seconds at a time. Mercedes estimates the CLE53 will accelerate from 0-60 mph in four seconds flat and says top speed is governed at 155 mph.\n\nBehind that engine is a nine-speed automatic transmission with an integrated electric starter-generator. Running off the same 48-volt electrical system as the electric compressor, the starter-generator helps smooth out starts and shifts. 4Matic all-wheel drive is standard, and power distribution between the axles is variable depending on drive mode and road conditions. The Mercedes-AMG CLE53 can also decouple its front axle completely when it’s not needed — or for drifting. As with other recent AWD AMGs, the CLE53 has a Drift mode that puts the front axle to sleep for gratuitous tail-out shenanigans.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: Redesigned to Combine Luxury and New Tech\nIs the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 Brings F1 Tech to the Masses (Who Can Afford a Mercedes)\n2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Review: Still the Best in the Business\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Upscale Tech, Upmarket Price\n… But Still Civilized\n\nThe CLE53’s standard AMG Ride Control suspension employs steel springs and adaptive dampers with Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ modes. In addition to three-stage steering that reduces assist as speed rises, the CLE53 also boasts rear-axle steering; it turns the rear wheels up to 2.5 degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels to aid low-speed maneuverability, or up to 0.7 degree in the same direction for high-speed stability. The speed at which the change from in sync to out happens depends on drive mode, but it’s generally 60 mph.\n\nInside, the CLE53 boasts the latest generation of Mercedes’ MBUX infotainment system, with an 11.9-inch center touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. The latter offers an AMG-exclusive Supersport layout featuring a prominent round tachometer in the center of the cluster flanked by customizable displays for engine data, suspension settings and more. Synthetic suede seating is standard, but Mercedes offers several leather options, as well. Optional AMG Performance Seats feature enhanced bolstering and vertical openings in the seatback to help minimize back sweat during extended high-performance sessions.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Coupe will go on sale in 2024. Mercedes hasn’t announced pricing yet for the rest of the CLE lineup, but the outgoing C-Class Coupe started around $50,000 and the E-Class around $70,000. We’re betting the new split-the-difference model skews a little higher than dead center in that spread, with the AMG CLE53 carrying a premium.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For longtime AMG owners who may be skeptical of the new CLE-Class — it’s bigger than the C-Class coupe and only has an inline-six-cylinder engine — Mercedes is presenting a counterargument with the 2026 AMG CLE53 Manufaktur Edition: It looks a lot like the old AMG C63 Edition 1.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Cabriolet: 443-HP, All-Wheel-Drive Convertible\n\nWhat Does the AMG CLE53 Look Like?\n\nWell, at least the coupe does. Painted a matte dark gray that Mercedes calls Graphite Grey Magno and sporting yellow AMG sill graphics, the Manufaktur Edition rides on black 20-inch wheels with a yellow rim flange. The theme continues inside, with yellow stitching on the black Nappa leather AMG sport seats and yellow sill-plate illumination.\n\nThere’s also a Manufaktur Edition CLE53 cabriolet with a different color combo. The AMG droptop is sprayed a dark matte blue called Starling Blue Magno, with black and blue graphics and silver-painted 20-inch wheels with black accents. It is fitted with a white Nappa leather interior with black stitching, carbon-fiber trim and white sill-plate illumination.\n\nWhat Features Does the AMG CLE53 Have?\n\nIn addition to their exclusive detailing, both Manufaktur Editions include a number of options and packages as standard equipment. On the coupe, those include the AMG Night Package Plus, which features black and dark-chrome exterior trim, as well as the AMG Performance Studio Package, which adds a lip spoiler and aerodynamic elements on the front and rear bumpers. The cabriolet is fitted with the AMG Carbon Fiber Package I and II, which renders the exterior trim, including the lip spoiler and mirror housings, in carbon fiber.\n\nBoth the coupe and convertible feature the AMG Dynamic Plus Package’s active engine mounts and composite brakes, as well as the AMG Real Performance Sound’s variable interior engine sound. They are also based on the range-topping Pinnacle trim, which includes upgraded LED headlights, augmented reality navigation and a head-up display.\n\nMechanically, the Manufaktur Editions are unchanged from the regular AMG CLE53. That means they are powered by a 443-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six that outputs 413 pounds-feet of torque; it’s backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE300 Coupe Review: The Merits of Calmness\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Cabriolet: Fusion of C and E, Priced From $65,500\nResearch the Mercedes-AMG CLE53\nMore Mercedes-Benz News\nFind Your Next Car\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Manufaktur Editions will be available later this year in limited numbers, with pricing to be announced closer to the start of sales. Aside from the exterior graphics, most of what identifies the pair is available on the regular cars.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Having just undertaken the monumental task of merging the compact C-Class and mid-size E-Class coupes into one vehicle for the 2024 model year (a Dr. Frankenstein-esque process, but with more artistry in the finished product), Mercedes-Benz is mostly leaving the resultant CLE alone for 2025. The only changes are a new Sun Yellow paint color and an available synthetic-leather steering wheel for an animal-free interior. The AMG CLE53 gets a new cabriolet version, plus a new available 20-inch wheel design in gray or black.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Cabriolet: 443-HP, All-Wheel-Drive Convertible\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE is available as a coupe or convertible with standard 4Matic all-wheel drive, and it’s on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,150 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nCoupe\nCLE300: $59,150\nCLE450: $68,600\nAMG CLE53: $75,450\nConvertible\nCLE300: $67,600\nCLE450: $76,950\nAMG CLE53: $83,750\nWhat Are the 2025 CLE Trim Levels?\n\nAs it’s a Mercedes-Benz derived in part from the sumptuous E-Class, it should come as no surprise that the CLE comes with a lengthy list of standard equipment. The base CLE300 rides on 18-inch wheels (the CLE450 and AMG 53 get 19s), and regardless of engine or body style, all CLEs include LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated washer nozzles, and keyless entry and start. Coupes get a panoramic moonroof, and a wind deflector and the Airscarf neck-level heat vents extend the top-down season for convertible buyers.\n\nThe interior features standard synthetic leather upholstery, power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and 64-color ambient lighting. Cabin tech includes wireless phone charging, a Burmester 3D surround-sound audio system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEvery version of the CLE is also available with a Pinnacle Trim Package, which adds upgraded headlights, augmented reality navigation, a head-up display and a 360-degree camera system. The Pinnacle Trim Package costs $2,600 on the 300 and 450, but $2,500 and $2,300 on the AMG coupe and convertible, respectively, as they already include the 360-degree camera system as standard equipment.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nOther than the surround-view camera system, the AMG and non-AMG CLEs have the same standard safety tech, including forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver attention monitor, automatic high beams and automated parking. The $1,950 Driver Assistance Package is available across the lineup and adds adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, automatic lane changes, front cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering, emergency steering assist and road-sign recognition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE300 Coupe Review: The Merits of Calmness\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe and Cabriolet: 2 Become 1\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz CLE300\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 CLE Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE is available with three engines, all of which are backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission and the aforementioned AWD. A mild-hybrid 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for 295 pounds-feet of torque propels the CLE300. It returns an EPA-estimated 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined in the coupe and 23/32/26 mpg in the convertible.\n\nThe CLE450 and AMG CLE53 both use a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. In the CLE450, output is 375 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque; it’s rated at 23/33/26 mpg as a coupe and 23/32/26 mpg as a convertible. In the AMG, an electrically powered turbo helps amp output up to 443 hp and 413 pounds-feet, with an overboost function increasing torque to 443 pounds-feet for short 10-second bursts. In addition to its engine, the AMG is sharpened with a sport suspension featuring adaptive dampers, upgraded brakes and rear-wheel steering. The AMG CLE53 coupe returns 20/27/23 mpg; the convertible, 19/26/22 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
