      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 53 delights; with an impeccable interior and grin-inducing performance, it’s a true jack-of-all-trades.\n\nVersus the competition: In most competitive vehicles, matching the AMG GT 53’s level of performance or luxury requires compromising on one trait or the other. Not here: This Mercedes gives you both in large doses.\n\nTossing the letters “AMG” in front of me is a good way to get my pulse to quicken, so to say I was excited to test this car would be an understatement. The 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 53 is a new addition to Mercedes’ lineup, building off the two-door AMG GT that’s offered in coupe and roadster versions.\n\nBut while that car is a two-seat touring sports car, the GT 53 is something else. Mercedes calls it a “four-door coupe,” but there’s nothing coupe-y about it. It’s bigger and has the footprint (and shape) of a much more substantial vehicle — one that has go-fast aspirations and room for both people and things.\n\nFor 2019, Mercedes will offer three versions of this new four-door variant: the AMG GT 53, AMG GT 63 and AMG GT 63 S. I tested the least powerful and least performance-oriented of the three and didn’t find it lacking at all. The AMG GT 53 competes in an elite strata of performance sedans/fastbacks, including the Porsche Panamera, BMW 650 Gran Coupe and Audi S7.\n\n \n\n2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 53 Four-Door Coupe | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSound and Fury\n\nUnder the hood of the AMG GT 53 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine that makes 429 horsepower and 384 pounds-feet of torque. The powertrain also features EQ Boost, a mild-hybrid system that can provide bursts of power to help the engine along. With EQ Boost activated, the powertrain’s output jumps up to 450 hp and 568 pounds-feet of torque. This gives the AMG GT 53 very impressive off-the-line performance; missing a stoplight won’t be a frustration, it’ll be an opportunity.\n\nThe AMG GT 53 also features a standard nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The transmission doesn’t have the fastest shifts or near-perfect logic, like Porsche’s PDK gearbox, but it does stand out in one area: It’s ultra-responsive. Throttle inputs are met with an immediate jolt of forward motion — even in Eco mode — which damps the inputs; it still feels responsive, just not as sharp. The AMG GT 53 doesn’t offer the same electronic locking differential that’s found on the GT 63, but the all-wheel-drive system is still welcome. The sharpness of the powertrain feels like it could overwhelm the tires if there were only two driven wheels; four wheels is the way to go here.\n\nMy test vehicle came with the optional performance exhaust system ($1,850), and it’s good for many auditory delights when turned up. The neighbors might not have been happy with it, but the grin I wore up and down the block all week showed just how amused I was by the appropriate soundtrack of burbles and pops. Fuel economy is an EPA-estimated 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\n2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 53 Four-Door Coupe | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nGrip and Rip\n\nThough you won’t forget the AMG GT 53’s girth, it somehow remains respectable in corners. While first getting to know the car I was a bit hesitant to really toss it into a turn — it’s a big boy with a curb weight of 4,447 pounds, and it doesn’t come with the rear-wheel steering or electronic locking differential that Mercedes offers on the AMG GT 63 and 63 S. Over time, though, my speeds started to creep up, I started braking a little later and the AMG GT 53 somehow popped me out the other side of each turn with a yawn.\n\nThe standard adaptive suspension does a good job mitigating body roll without sacrificing too much feel. Other suspensions like this take away too much of the driving sensation. To be sure, a car that controls its mass is a faster car, but that type of vagueness is unsettling; if I’m not on a track, I prefer to feel the car move a little to let me know what it’s doing — and the AMG GT 53 does just that. Scroll through the car’s suspension modes and you’ll fine a perfect setting for each situation. It transitioned from sharp canyon-carver to luxury cruiser at the touch of a button. Same goes for the steering, which was amply weighted and provided plenty of feedback.\n\nMy test vehicle also came equipped with summer tires (Michelin Pilot Sport 4S) as a no-cost option, wrapped around $3,950 21-inch black AMG wheels. Putting on the right shoes goes a long way, both for dancing and for driving, and this rubber was a perfect match for the AMG GT 53. I know this all sounds effusive, but that’s because this is a very dialed-in car — the powertrain, the suspension and the steering all work in close concert to offer something that can feel elusive in luxury circles these days: fun.\n\nRed Hot Interior\n\nI love interiors with a lot of color, so when I opened the door to the AMG GT 53 I let out an audible gasp — followed up by the fleet rep who dropped off the car saying, “I know, right?” The same thing that’s true about the driving experience (loud and luxurious) applies to the car’s insides.\n\nThe seats and interior styling are fantastic, but they don’t come cheap. My test car’s color was called Red Pepper, and wrapping the interior with it costs a cool $3,950. The headliner, which is a Black Dinamica faux suede, costs another $1,600. For a headliner! The Nappa-leather-wrapped steering wheel adds $500. Tack on $2,500 for AMG performance seats, $700 to make them multifunctional, and another $450 each to add heating and ventilation, and the price tag for the interior (without including a few other options) jumps up to nearly $10,000.\n\nThe dashboard looks deceptively simple, but it hides complicated secrets. Twin 12.3-inch widescreen displays are mounted side by side to give the appearance of one ultra-wide screen: The left one serves as the de facto instrument panel, while the right one controls the vehicle’s many multimedia functions and vehicle settings. The AMG GT 53 uses Mercedes latest system, called MBUX (pronounced “emm-bee-you-ecks” versus the “emm-bucks” I like more), and it’s a powerful — if rather convoluted — system. This car has a ton of customizable options on it and the menus can get labyrinthian. A new owner could easily take between 30 minutes and an hour getting the car set up the way they’d like, but once it is set up it makes quite a home.\n\nThe control scheme doesn’t really help matters. You can control the system via myriad voice commands, using the touchpad between the front seats, touching the screen itself or using a pair of controllers on the steering-wheel spokes that you scroll over with your thumbs. In my week with the car I ended up mostly using the touchpad or the steering-wheel controls for very simple operations because they get a bit finnicky. You do have to look down a lot to use this system; I wouldn’t recommend trying any new functionality when the car is moving unless you have a passenger do it.\n\nThis was thankfully not the first Mercedes I’ve tested with this setup, and that definitely helped. It has a steep learning curve that’s rewarding once you figure it out, but I fear the bar to entry might be too high for those who prefer simplicity. One more thing to note — Android Auto is not offered, only Apple CarPlay, so Android users will be forced to use the native system.\n\n2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 53 Four-Door Coupe | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nHow Much Are Kidneys Going for These Days?\n\nNo beating around the bush, the AMG GT 53 will put a dent in your wallet. Its base price is as close to six figures as you can get: $99,995 including destination charge. My test vehicle tacked on more than $25,000 in options on top of that, landing at a final price of $125,300. As mentioned earlier, almost $10,000 of that comes from just the interior, and the inside isn’t alone in being expensive; just that very cool matte paint job is $3,950.\n\nIt’s kind of off-putting that something this expensive doesn’t come with many standard safety features. The Driver Assistance Package, which adds adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, among other features, costs another $2,250. A 360-degree camera system is a stand-alone $500 option.\n\nI will concede this point though: It’s a car that feels like it earns every dollar of that big price. The AMG GT 53’s easy transition between luxury cruiser and capable sports sedan makes it a vehicle that’s both easy to drive every day and a blast when the road winds. It’s fantastic.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door feels like a fancier, sportier version of the brand’s mainstay mid-sizer E-Class.\n\nVersus the competition: The AMG GT 53 is a softer, more ostentatious take on the “four-door coupe” idea, less aggressive than rival Porsche Panamera, more opulent than a BMW M850 Gran Coupe and more tech-laden than a Maserati Quattroporte.\n\nYou wouldn’t necessarily think the idea of a large sedan styled like a slinky coupe with a low roof and swoopy styling would be in such demand that half a dozen different automakers would create their own versions of said style. But have a quick look at the high end of the sporty luxury sedan market and that’s exactly what you’ll find: The Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door is just one of several models catering to this rarified buyer. It competes with the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera, Maserati Quattroporte and Audi S7; even the Tesla Model S and Lucid Air could be included in there. They’re all sport-minded, $100,000 luxury cars with serious capabilities and looks to match.\n\nRelated: 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT Brings Stunning Concept Design to the Street\n\nMercedes-Benz itself even has another model like this, the CLS450, which is also based on the E-Class sedan and features the same engine as the AMG GT 4-Door coupe, albeit less expensive. But Mercedes takes an approach that gives you options for the GT 4-Door, and they’re largely powertrain-based: The “base” AMG GT43 4-Door coupe features a 362-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine with mild-hybrid boost; the mid-level GT53 4-Door has the same engine but bumped up to 429 hp; and the top-rung AMG GT63 and GT63 S 4-Doors both feature a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 and make 575 hp and 630 hp, respectively.\n\nThe one I review below is the mid-level AMG GT53, featuring the more powerful 3.0-liter inline-six without all the crazy track-oriented features and powertrain (and commensurate price bump) in the GT63. It’s meant less for track driving and more for street driving, it seems, with an opulence to it that makes me wonder who this is for and why someone would pick it over the similar E-Class sedan on which it’s based. Is swoopier styling really enough to justify the price bump and model difference?\n\nYou’ve Got Style, You’ve Got Grace\n\nWe’ll skip the whole controversy on whether or not this is a proper coupe. Despite having four doors, it suffers from the same characteristics two-door coupes deal with — namely, poor outward visibility, curtailed interior headroom and highway noise issues thanks to the frameless windows. The AMG GT53 is no exception to any of this. The car’s styling is only moderately successful, in my opinion, in trying to bring over the knockout looks of the AMG GT Coupe two-door to a larger canvas. It’s too bulky to have the svelte, sculpted look of its sibling, and instead comes off as somewhat bloated and overstuffed, similar to how the original Porsche Panamera looked before its most recent restyling leaned out its curves. Mercedes’ own CLS four-door coupe is more elegant, more flowing, and I think it does a better job of translating a coupe look to a four-door vehicle.\n\nOne thing that does help the AMG GT 4-Door’s looks are large wheels, which this test vehicle did not have. The wheels on my test vehicle were the standard 19-inch wheels that look decidedly undersized for the car (necessitated, I think, by the fact that it came to my house on snow tires in the middle of winter). There are better-looking 20-inch and truly attractive 21-inch wheels available; they’re a must-have for a car like this.\n\nPerformance Aplenty\n\nOne area that differentiates the AMG GT 4-Door from the CLS is in the way it drives. The mission of the CLS is to be elegant and luxurious, while the AMG GT53 is decidedly skewed toward the sporty end of the super-sedan spectrum. The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine cranks out a healthy 429 hp and 389 pounds-feet of torque, accompanied by truly beautiful engine noises that only a straight-six can make. Like most AMG-tuned engines, it produces massive acceleration when called upon, but given this is just the mid-level powertrain and not the crazy twin-turbo V-8, it’s also perfectly civilized around town. It’s mated to an AMG-tuned nine-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission that directs power to all four wheels. The engine is assisted by a mild-hybrid electric boost that’s so mild, it’s all but invisible. You’d never know it was there if Mercedes didn’t tell you about it.\n\nThe suspension damping is electronic, as well, and like so many other attributes of Mercedes-Benz and its AMG-tuned vehicles, vehicle systems like ride quality, steering response and transmission behavior are adjustable. Turn them all the way soft for a comfy luxo-cruiser or all the way hard for a supposedly track-capable sports car. I say “supposedly” because cars like these are style statements meant to be seen in and enjoyed on back roads, but they’re not serious track machines for fun weekend club events or parking lot autocrosses. That the company has spent so much effort on AMG-ifying the thing to make you think it’s a track monster just reinforces this image.\n\nBut the end result is a low-slung, stylish sedan that’s enjoyable to drive thanks to a beautifully sorted powertrain, copious available power and excellent dynamic responses. The steering isn’t terribly communicative (I partially blame the snow tires I had), and the big car plows through corners with predictable understeer, once again bending my opinion of it to be more of a grand tourer better suited to high-speed cross-country interstates than tight, twisty canyons. Still, it’s a big sedan that you can drive fast, drive aggressively, enjoy doing so and look good doing it. For a lot of buyers in this category, that’s pretty much the list of requirements fulfilled.\n\nCompromises Inside\n\nThe interior of the AMG GT 4-Door is one of compromises. There are obvious similarities to the E-Class and CLS, such as the beautiful sweep of the dash, door panels and the instrumentation. There are some AMG touches in there, as well, including bright-red seat belts, sport seat designs and an AMG-style steering wheel with auxiliary controls. But the big difference here is the inclusion of a version of the wide center console that’s been poached from the two-door AMG GT Coupe and plonked down between the front-seat occupants. It’s not identical to the unit in the smaller two-door, but it is indeed distinctive with its buttons and little LCD screens. It feels a lot wider than the console in an E-Class or CLS, eating into width and legroom for those front-seat occupants. Again, it’s a compromise from a big sedan being made into a four-door coupe idea.\n\nThat compromise also happens in the headroom department. Versus an E-Class, the AMG GT 4-Door’s A-pillar is noticeably closer to the driver’s head, and the windshield is fairly low, obscuring the view forward and up (though not nearly as bad as it is in the GT Coupe). The backseat suffers more, with that droopy roofline and low door opening making not only for one’s head hard up against the headliner in the backseat, but some interesting contortions on getting into or out of the backseat.\n\nThe multimedia system in the AMG GT 4-Door is the latest MBUX system, which works quite well in some ways and less well in others. The voice activation is still a bit buggy, activating whenever anyone says the word “Mercedes,” meaning you can’t talk about the car while driving it unless you want it talking back to you. The touch-sensitive bits on the steering wheel are also maddening, but we’ve covered that before — there are parts of the steering wheel you cannot touch without activating something, which is also quite frustrating, especially in a sporty car meant to be driven aggressively. But the displays are still quite striking in their clarity and size, the information they provide is complete and reconfigurable among several different styles. Once you get familiar with how they work (there will be a learning curve), they function adequately and without too much distraction.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Mercedes-AMG C43 Brings F1 Tech to the Masses (Who Can Afford a Mercedes)\n2022 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: 6 Things We Like (and 5 Not So Much)\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Upscale Tech, Upmarket Price\n2022 Mercedes EQS: Think of It as an Electric S-Class\nWhy This Over Competitors?\n\nThat’s a good question. Honestly, I think it’s going to boil down in the end more toward brand loyalty and personal style preferences. The AMG GT53 4-Door is stylish, customizable, quick and enjoyable to drive, and it makes a definite statement for someone who wants that three-pointed star on their car when they arrive at the club. But it’s not appreciably better than a BMW M850i xDrive, which is equally stylish, excellent to drive, opulently appointed and priced similarly. And if you really want performance in a four-door coupe look, the Porsche Panamera with its myriad trim levels, powertrain choices, electrification options, body styles and price points covers a lot more ground than the AMG GT 4-Door.\n\nStarting price for a 2022 AMG GT43 4-Door is $93,550 including destination fee, which is nearly $20,000 more than Mercedes-Benz’s other four-door coupe, the CLS450. Given the significant design, structural and content changes between them, however, this isn’t entirely surprising. The GT53 4-Door with its more powerful engine starts at $103,650, which is spot on versus its competition. My test car, however, saw a number of options — such as the Burmester premium audio system and AMG sport seats — that pushed the grand total beyond $120,000, which is also not entirely unusual for vehicles in this category. Still, it feels like a lot for a six-cylinder sedan.\n\nWhat Mercedes-Benz and its sporty-car wizards at AMG have crafted here is something that’s purpose built and targeted at a very specific customer, one who isn’t afraid to lose some function to style, but also isn’t quite ready to go whole hog into the sports car arena. It’s compromise incarnate, but there have been worse compromises made.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Monterey Car Week in California is likely the nation’s largest gathering of moneyed car geeks — an appropriate venue, then, to debut a new luxury sports car. Mercedes-AMG, the fabled German automaker’s in-house performance arm, took advantage of the 2023 gathering to roll out the new generation of its GT coupe after a three-year hiatus. We already had sufficient technical detail to be excited about the 2024 AMG GT coupe, but now Mercedes has filled in the last important blank: The car will start at $136,050 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: A Return for the EQ-Avoidant\n\nPowertrain Specs and 0-60 MPH\n\nThe 2024 AMG GT coupe gets two versions of the same engine. In the AMG GT55, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine generates 469 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes says the GT55 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 183 mph. In the GT63, improved airflow and increased turbo boost amp output up to 577 hp and 590 pounds-feet. The additional power shortens the GT63’s sprint to 60 mph to just 3.1 seconds, and its top speed stretches to 196 mph. Both engines send their power through a nine-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels.\n\nStandard Performance Tech\n\nThe standard 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system continuously varies torque distribution, never sending more than 50% of available power to the front wheels but directing all of the power rearward in Drift mode. Drift mode is just one aspect of the AMG Dynamic Plus Package, which is also included on every AMG GT. The package additionally features an electronically controlled limited-slip differential and active engine mounts that can vary their firmness to isolate occupants from the engine’s vibrations for comfortable cruising or tighten up for quicker handling response during performance driving.\n\nOther standard equipment on the AMG GT includes rear-axle steering, active aerodynamics and AMG Active Ride Control, which features active roll stabilization to keep the body level during hard cornering.\n\nVast Personalization Menu\n\nAMG is offering 11 exterior paint colors on the GT, including six added-cost Manufaktur finishes. Numerous 20- and 21-inch wheels are available, as are nine upholstery options (seven of them Nappa leather and the remaining two Nappa leather with microfiber inserts). Naturally, there are multiple trim options, as well as available sport seats.\n\nBuyers looking for a more aggressive look can spec the optional AMG Aerodynamics Package, which adds air deflectors front and rear, a larger rear diffuser, and a fixed wing in place of the standard active spoiler. Also adding the AMG Carbon Fiber Package renders some of those bits — and the sill panel inserts, mirror housings and front splitter — in exposed carbon fiber.\n\nOf particular interest to buyers building out that last package is the available front-axle lift system to help the nose clear driveway transitions and speed bumps. Not only does it raise the nose 1.2 inches, but it’s tied into the GPS to “remember” obstacles and automatically raise the nose when encountering them again.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT coupe will arrive at dealerships in the spring. The GT55 will have a starting price of $136,050, and the GT63 will start at $177,050. Relative to the most expensive vehicle to sell at auction during Car Week, though — a 1967 Ferrari 412P Berlinetta that hammered for more than $30 million — its sticker seems reasonable.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMercedes-AMG GT Coupe, Roadster Go Stealth (but by No Means Stealthy) for 2021\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro: Not for Amateurs\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster: Test-Drive Video\n2022 Mercedes-AMG GT53 4-Door Review: A Stylish Compromise\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT is a performance-oriented luxury car that can be had in two-door coupe and coupelike four-door sedan body styles. The coupe rejoined the line in redesigned form last year, but the four-door’s core design dates back to the 2019 model year. The AMG GT’s broad range of turbocharged powertrains starts with a 416-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and tops out with a plug-in hybrid V-8 that produces up to 831 hp. \n\nOnly the AMG GT43 coupe offers rear-wheel drive; all other variants come standard with all-wheel drive. The coupe offers a choice of the turbocharged four-cylinder or twin-turbocharged V-8s with outputs ranging from 469 to 603 hp. The sedan’s entry-level engine is a 362-hp, turbocharged and supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six; twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8s similar to those available in the coupe are also optional in the sedan. This Mercedes’ plug-in hybrid V-8 powertrain churns out 805 hp in the coupe and 831 hp in the sedan.\n\nThe AMG GT’s rivals include the Audi RS7, BMW M5 and M8, Chevrolet Corvette, Lexus LC 500 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nThe AMG GT coupe fleshes out its model lineup with the addition of the four-cylinder GT43, a track-focused GT63 Pro and GT63 S E Performance plug-in hybrid versions for 2025. The AMG GT sedan is unchanged save for a couple new color choices.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nBurmester surround-sound stereo\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\n11.9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n19-inch alloy wheels\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\n64-color ambient interior lighting\nMultiple USB-C charge ports\n“Hey Mercedes” voice command system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nSurround-view camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRear-wheel steering\nFront-axle lift system\nAdaptive suspension\nCarbon ceramic brakes\nUpgraded exterior aero trim\nNavigation with augmented reality overlay\nHead-up display\nNappa leather upholstery\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nMore heavily bolstered front sport seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nYou certainly won’t fade into the background when behind the wheel of either the AMG GT coupe or sedan. Their dramatic design is a huge draw, though the sedan is arguably the more sensible choice if you sometimes need your car to be practical. Rear seats are optional in the coupe, though the only thing you’d want to put in them are shopping bags or luggage. The base coupe’s turbocharged four-cylinder and the turbocharged inline-six in the sedan should satisfy most luxury-car shoppers. Still, it’s hard to resist the allure of the available twin-turbo V-8s, particularly the shatteringly fast plug-in hybrid versions: Mercedes-Benz estimates the AMG GT63 S E Performance can rocket from 0-60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds. Just be careful to budget for gasoline — or potential speeding tickets — because those top trims can double the price of this already-six-figures-to-start car.",
