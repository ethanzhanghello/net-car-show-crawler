      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe intense intramural rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and BMW requires that Mercedes offer a competitor to the BMW M3, and the C63 AMG fills that role. It comes only with rear-wheel drive, and despite the car’s compact dimensions Mercedes has managed to squeeze a twin-turbo V-8 engine under the hood.\n\nTwo versions are available: the C63 and C63 S. The latter gets an extra 34 horsepower, red brake calipers, dynamic engine mounts, 19-inch wheels (instead of 18-inch rims) and Nappa leather.\nWhat’s Special\n\nHand-built twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8\n469 hp (503 hp in C63 S)\nSeven-speed automatic transmission with four modes\nSelectable driving modes\nAdaptive sport suspension\nBurmester surround-sound audio system\nAvailable carbon fiber interior trim\nAvailable carbon fiber rear spoiler and side mirror caps\n\nHere’s info on the regular C-Class:\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan was redesigned last year, jumping in size and gaining new powertrains and a host of high-tech safety features.
