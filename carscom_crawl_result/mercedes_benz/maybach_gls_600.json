      "expert_review": "Key Points:\n\nFor 2026, the GLS three-row SUV starts at $91,500 (all prices include $1,250 destination fee).\nA new Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition on the AMG GLS63, new paint choices and new design packages for the Maybach mark the only changes to the GLS line for the new model year.\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV and its ultra-luxury Maybach GLS variant carry over into the new model year with two new exterior paint options, and a Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition can be had on the performance-oriented AMG GLS63. The 2026 GLS starts at $91,500.\n\nRelated: 2026 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Manufaktur Arctic Silver Edition Stands Out, Subtly\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nMercedes’ largest SUV mostly carries over for 2026 in four-, six- or seven-occupant configurations. The base 450 can be optioned in new Manufaktur Silicon Grey and Manufaktur Moonlight White Magno coats. Additionally, new Night Series Exterior and Design packages are available on the Maybach GLS600. They   exclusive color choices, darkened chrome exterior accents and black 23-inch wheels with summer performance tires.\n\nThe GLS63’s special Arctic Silver Edition comes in an exclusive Manufaktur Cirrus Silver Magno (Magno is Mercedes-speak for matte). The cosmetic package adds contrasting black-and-red accents inside and out, as well as all the gloss-black exterior accents of the AMG Night Package. Red brake calipers peek out of the SUV’s matte-black 23-inch wheels that sport red rim flanges and center-cap detailing, and the interior features red-and-black Nappa leather upholstery on quilted front seats.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Mercedes-Benz GLS is on sale now. Full pricing for the lineup is as follows:\n\nGLS450: $91,500\nGLS580: $117,400\nAMG GLS63: $152,300\nMaybach GLS600: $181,250\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2026 GLS lineup uses a nine-speed automatic transmission and the brand’s 4Matic all-wheel-drive system. The GLS450 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and mild-hybrid system making 375 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque in total. Mercedes says it accelerates from 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds. The 2025 model returned 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined; that EPA rating is expected to carry over (official estimates for the 2026 lineup are not yet available, however).\n\nThe other GLS variants utilize variations of Mercedes’ famed twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. In the GLS580, the mild-hybrid V-8 generates 510 hp and 538 pounds-feet; it hits 60 mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds and should return the same 14/19/16 mpg as the 2025 version.\n\nThe 603-hp AMG GLS63 churns out 627 pounds-feet of torque and has a 0-60 mph time of just 4.1 seconds. It should maintain an EPA-rated 14/18/15 mpg for 2026.\n\nThe Maybach GLS600 splits the performance equation between the GLS580 and GLS63 and goes all in on luxury. Its V-8 makes 550 hp and 568 pounds-feet, and the SUV has a claimed 4.6-second sprint to 60 mph. The EPA rated the luxury liner at 13/18/15 mpg for 2025.\n\nRead More About the Mercedes-Benz GLS:\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 Review: King of the Luxury Family SUV Brawlers\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS580?\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nIs the 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 a Good SUV? 4 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nStandard Safety Features and Equipment\n\nThe flagship GLS SUV comes well equipped (as it should for the price). The standard safety features across the lineup include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, front cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, lane departure steering assist, lane change assist, emergency steering assist, road-sign recognition and a driver attention monitor. The GLS also has a self-parking feature and a standard 360-degree camera system that helps see what’s around such a large vehicle.\n\nThe base GLS450 rides on an air spring suspension with adaptive dampers and 21-inch wheels. Mercedes upholsters the inside in synthetic leather, and the interior features power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, four-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster complements a 12.3-inch touchscreen with augmented reality navigation, voice control, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless device charging and a 13-speaker Burmester surround-sound system are also standard.\n\nThe GLS580 comes with bigger 22-inch wheels, and the price hike incorporates leather upholstery, massaging front seats with rapid heating, heated second-row seats, five-zone automatic climate control and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe AMG GLS63 buttons down more power with a stiffer sport suspension and a limited-slip rear differential. It also features Nappa leather upholstery, active engine mounts, a Class IV trailer hitch and a performance exhaust. A head-up display is also standard in the AMG variant.\n\nShoppers seeking the finest in luxury without the mad power of the GLS63 can look to the ultra-luxe Mercedes-Maybach GLS600. Distinctive mono- and two-tone paint schemes and exclusive 22-inch wheel designs elevate the Maybach. It rides on Mercedes’ E-Active Body Control that proactively tweaks the suspension response at each wheel to soften bumps. The SUV’s suspension also stiffens against body roll when turning at speed, or if the GLS gets stuck, the system pumps the suspension to help loosen it.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a full-size SUV that seats up to seven people in three rows. It’s powered by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six (GLS450) or a 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (GLS580). The ultra-luxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display that takes a lot of practice to learn. GLS competitors include the BMW X7, Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nAll GLS trims get styling updates, including a larger grille, revised front bumper and new LED taillights, while the performance-focused AMG and ultra-luxury Maybach versions get model-specific trim revisions inside and out. All models now come with the latest version of Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX infotainment system and a customizable digital instrument cluster with a choice of three display layouts. A new “transparent hood” feature in off-road mode uses the surround-view camera system to provide a view underneath the vehicle. The GLS450 and GLS580 both receive a bit more power: The GLS450’s 375-hp rating represents a 13-hp bump over last year, while the GLS580’s 510-hp rating is a 27-hp bump.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo system\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nSurround-view parking camera system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo system\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all their luggage from point A to point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling thirst, there are few things to nitpick in Mercedes’ largest SUV.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a full-size SUV that can seat up to seven people in three rows. It’s powered by a 375-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine (450) or 510-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (580). The ultraluxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. GLS competitors include the BMW X7, Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nAfter a 2024 refresh, the GLS mostly stands pat for 2025. All trims now come with a biometric fingerprint sensor, and several special-order Manufaktur paint colors and trim choices are newly available. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo system\nPanoramic moonroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\n360-degree camera system \n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo system\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all of their luggage from Point A to Point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display that takes a lot of practice to learn. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling nature, there are few things to nitpick in Mercedes’ largest SUV.",

      "expert_review": "If you have the means to acquire a six-figure Mercedes-Benz SUV, hats off to you — you’re doing all right, aren’t ya? For the rest of us, well, we’ll just have to look on in envy as you decide which of Mercedes’ truly outrageous super-luxe SUV offerings is the right one for you.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class Is Formidable Foe to BMW X7\n\nThe German luxury automaker has several big, luxurious, ostensibly off-road-capable people movers that cost north of $100,000, but when two of them rolled through our Detroit bureau earlier this year, priced similarly yet vastly different in their demeanor and appeal, we wondered: If you have the means to afford either a 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 or 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600, which would you choose? Here’s our take on how these two titans of mall and trail stack up against each other — and our recommendation for which one might be right for you.\n\nThe Contestants\n\nIn one corner is the 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63, the top prestige model for the G-Wagen lineup (the G65 has not reappeared … yet). Massaged by the performance engineers at AMG, the big box has been given a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 hand-assembled and signed by a single technician; it pumps out 577 horsepower and 627 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to an AMG-massaged nine-speed automatic transmission. Power is routed to all four wheels via a two-speed transfer case and axles with two lockable differentials.\n\n2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nThe G-Wagen got a major update for the 2019 model year with significant changes to its suspension, wheelbase and interior, but Mercedes engineers were very careful to keep the iconic retro touches that a surprising number of buyers globally absolutely adore: the look, the parts, the off-road ability and even the way the doors close like a bank vault and the electronic locks clack like a rifle bolt slamming home. Price as tested: $182,545 (all prices include destination).\n\n2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nIn the other corner is the 2021 Mercedes-Maybach GLS600, the new-for-2021 flagship luxury SUV that is meant to be the SUV equivalent to the company’s S-Class sedan. The Maybach trim is meant to denote something special, and special it is, from its looks to its ultra-opulent cabin. Like the G63, it’s also powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, but it puts out slightly less grunt at 550 hp and 538 pounds-feet of torque. You get a nine-speed automatic and 4Matic all-wheel drive here, too; you also get an air suspension and the remarkable E-Active Body Control. Other luxury touches abound, such as reclining rear seats with footrests, a fridge, champagne flutes for the backseat occupants and Nappa leather upholstery throughout. Price as tested: $165,850, but it can go a lot higher if you opt for things like the $18,500 two-tone paint or $5,500 23-inch wheels.\n\nStyle: AMG G63\n\nStyle is subjective, of course, but judging by comments from friends, family and internet folks, the G63 is the far more appealing choice based on style — and I don’t disagree. That iconic, quasi-military look has served the Gelaendewagen since its introduction as an actual military vehicle in the 1970s, and the latest update only makes it more appealing. The AMG versions look menacing, with blacked-out trim, big wheels and even that performance exhaust poking out the sides adding to the predatory aura. \n\nThe Maybach, on the other hand, just comes off as gaudy. Its massive chrome mesh bumper grille is the main culprit, which looks completely out of place on what is otherwise a clean, fairly anonymously shaped SUV. Yes, there are Maybach logos on the D-pillars to let passersby know this isn’t an ordinary GLS, but I think they got that message already if they happened to see it coming at them. \n\nStyle points go to the AMG in this match-up, for while a lot of other automakers have big, questionably tacky luxury SUVs, few have anything as dramatic and distinctive as the G63.\n\nComfort: Maybach GLS600\n\nAs much as the G63 wins out over the Maybach for outward styling, those positions swap completely when it comes to interior comfort. There’s no contest here: The Maybach GLS600 wins hands down. It’s far more spacious inside, with legroom in the first and second rows that dwarfs the G63’s narrower, shorter interior. Despite the bump in length that the G63 received for 2019, which turned its second-row bench into less of a penalty box, nothing tops the optional powered, heated and cooled twin recliners in the Maybach’s second row.\n\nIf that’s not posh enough for you, there’s a console between the seats that contains a set of champagne flutes, and behind that is an optional wine chiller fridge. Excessive? Totally. But in terms of interior coddling, the limousine-like executive accommodations of the Maybach GLS put it ahead here.\n\nUtility: Tie … Sort Of\n\nHere’s the problem with both of these SUVs: Neither one of them is very good at being an SUV. Each of them has issues with utility. The GLS600 can’t fit anything big in back because it has a sizable fridge smack in the middle of the cargo area, meaning it can fit two, maybe three suitcases to either side of it. And those big captain’s chairs don’t fold down, either; they’re fixed in position because they have a power recline. You can opt for a five-occupant setup and forgo the fridge and champagne flutes — but then, why splurge for a Maybach at all? \n\nOn the other hand, the AMG G63 isn’t very good at being an SUV, either. While it does have a pretty decently sized cargo area, it also has a super-heavy, manually operated, side-opening swing-gate instead of a power liftgate like the GLS. And if you want to fold down the backseats to accommodate something big, the front seats have to be moved forward a considerable distance, reducing the already tight front-seat room and keeping it reduced as long as the rear seats are down. \n\nSo yeah, this is a tie for the worst attributes. The best option would be a GLS450, which can swallow a lot of people or gear, but isn’t the prestige limousine that the Maybach is.\n\nDynamics: Maybach GLS600\n\nThe G63 has a completely different personality than the GLS600, and it shows up best in how it drives. The optional performance exhaust turns the G63 into a roaring, growling beast, and the side exhaust amplifies that by blasting that intoxicating snarl back into the cabin through the side windows. Subtle, it’s not, but it’s also tall, tippy, a bit bouncy and still demonstrates its off-road-capable roots through ride and handling that are secondary considerations to its style and presence. \n\nThe GLS600 is exactly the opposite, with its air suspension delivering a serene, coddling and glass-smooth ride. It goes beyond just Comfort mode on the drive mode selector with an actual Maybach mode, slowing all of the SUV’s responses down in favor of cosseting. It also has Mercedes’ magical E-Active Body Control, an electronic suspension system that uses predictive road scanning and driver input to bank the SUV into corners like an airplane, minimizing sideways centrifugal stress on occupants. It’s not as engaging to drive as the AMG G63, but it is far, far more pleasant.\n\nWow Factor: AMG G63\n\nMercedes may rank the Maybach sub-brand as its prestige model, but there’s no denying the practical prestige appeal of the G-Wagen. These SUVs are thick as flies in Southern California and had a cult following among the glitterati even before the update. This new one only compounds that desirability, with the same appeal the Jeep Wrangler has for a lot of its buyers. They want the image and are willing to live with compromises in drivability, comfort and utility that owning one brings. \n\nThe Maybach GLS600 really can’t compete with that. Its more anonymous shape, the still-obscure Maybach branding and oddly blingy, tacked-on chrome don’t give it the exclusivity cachet the G63 already features as standard.\n\nSo in the end, it’s really a question of what you want your SUV to be: a limousine or a personal statement. The Maybach GLS600 is the definitive choice if you want to be chauffeured to an event in maximum comfort, but the AMG G63 is the one to choose if your arrival is the event.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS is a full-size SUV with three rows and a 362-horsepower, turbocharged inline-six (450) or 483-hp, twin-turbo V-8 (580). The ultra-luxury Maybach GLS600 and high-performance AMG GLS63 get a twin-turbo V-8 with 550 and 603 hp, respectively. All GLS models come standard with all-wheel drive. There’s enough room for adults in all three rows, which isn’t always the case even in extra-large SUVs. A digital instrument panel sits flush with the infotainment screen, creating an attractive display (that also takes a lot of practice to learn). GLS competitors include the Audi Q7, BMW X7, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nA panoramic moonroof is newly standard on every GLS, and the entry-level GLS450 4Matic now has standard metallic paint.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nSynthetic leather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n12.3-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto \nNavigation\nSatellite radio\n13-speaker Burmester stereo\nPanoramic sunroof\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nSurround-view parking camera system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n26-speaker Burmester stereo\nHead-up instrument display\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nFive-zone climate control\nMassaging front seats\nHeated armrests\nHeated and cooled cupholders\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLS is a very luxurious way to transport lots of people and all their luggage from point A to point B. With powerful engines and a commanding view of the road, the GLS has tons of road presence; it feels worth its admittedly high asking price. Other than some quirky voice commands and its fuel-guzzling thirst, there are few things to nitpick with Mercedes’ largest SUV.",
