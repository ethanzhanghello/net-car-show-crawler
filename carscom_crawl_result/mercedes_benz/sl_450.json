      "expert_review": "For 60 years, the Mercedes-Benz SL has been an icon of style and luxury. With Mercedes-Benz rapidly updating all the vehicles in its lineup with a new look prefaced by the CLA-Class and S-Class, attention has turned to the SL roadster, which gets freshened for the 2017 model year.\n\n\nAlong with the cosmetic updates to the flagship roadster are a new engine and a power bump for all four models.\n\nExterior\n\n\nOutside, the new SL gets a front-end nose job in true Beverly Hills style. A new diamond-pattern grille, LED headlights and bumper are meant to bring the SL in line with the AMG GT coupe’s styling, while some tweaks to the taillights keep the rear end fresh as well. The overall look isn’t all that different from the outgoing SL, but it does bring some of the AMG GT’s athleticism to the luxury party.\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe cabin gets a minor refresh for 2017, with a couple of new panels and an update to the multimedia system that now includes Apple CarPlay. Ambient lighting and Nappa leather are still optional, but a Harman Kardon surround-sound system is standard (you’ll pay handsomely for the optional Bang & Olufsen sound system on the AMG models).\n\nThe hardtop roof now can be operated at speeds up to 25 mph, and as before, the electronically darkening Magic Sky Control LCD glass roof panel is an option. In the cargo area, a new automatic trunk separator automatically moves when the top is lowered.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nThere are four possible powertrains, depending on how fast you want to go and how much you want to spend. New for 2017 is the SL450, featuring a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 362 horsepower; Mercedes-Benz says it’s good for a zero-to-60-mph run of 4.9 seconds. Step up to the SL550 for a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 that pumps out a healthy 449 hp and hits 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. If this isn’t fast or expensive enough, the AMG SL63 features a larger 5.5-liter V-8 and 577 hp, allowing you to get to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The top dog in the SL fleet is the AMG SL65, which sports a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12 engine that produces 621 hp and a mind-melting 738 pounds-feet of torque. It hits 60 mph in 4 seconds. The SL450 and SL550 both get a nine-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels, while the AMG models do with a beefier seven-speed multiclutch automatic.\n\nThe SL features all of the adjustable suspension bits one expects in high-end Benzes, with standard Dynamic Select allowing you to choose shock absorber behavior and transmission function that ranges from comfortable to serious sportiness. All manner of electronic control systems are available, but now you can specify Active Body Control with a curve-tilting feature that actively tilts the body up to almost 3 degrees to level the car in a turn.\n\nSafety\n\n\nWith the Mercedes-Benz flagship roadster comes a high level of electronic safety systems, some standard, most optional. All SLs feature parking sensors and collision warning sensors, but you have to pony up for the Driver Assistance Package to get things like blind spot warning, lane keep assist and automatic cruise control with autonomous braking.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nThe two-seat Mercedes-Benz SL-Class, a retractable-hardtop convertible, is constructed mostly of aluminum and is offered with a choice of V-6 or V-8 power. The base SL450 gets a 362-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, while the SL550 uses a 449-hp, twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8; a handcrafted 577-hp, twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 powers the AMG SL63. All models have rear-wheel drive. The SL competes with the BMW 6 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nThe AMG SL65 version, which was powered by a V-12 engine, has been discontinued. The returning models receive no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe SL comes with features not found on many other cars. The power-retractable roof can be raised or lowered while the car is moving at up to 25 mph. When the top is up, an available panoramic glass section can automatically change from dark to transparent. An available active suspension adjusts to reduce body roll in corners and lowers automatically at high speeds.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nThe SL roadster has been coddling Mercedes customers for more than 60 years, and though it doesn’t rank in the same performance league as the Porsche 911, the SL550 and AMG SL63 are hardly boulevard cruisers. They offer elegant surroundings and enough verve to keep most drivers entertained.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nThe two-seat Mercedes-Benz SL-Class, a retractable-hardtop convertible, is constructed mostly of aluminum and is offered with a choice of V-6 or V-8 power. The SL450 gets a 362-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine, while the SL550 uses a 449-hp, twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8. Both models have rear-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The SL competes with the BMW 8 Series and Lexus LC 500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nKeyless access and push-button start are now standard, and a new limited-edition Grand Edition is available. The Grand Edition features Graphite Grey paint, AMG 10-spoke wheels, revised front bumper styling, brown and black Nappa leather upholstery with gray contrast stitching and piping, embroidered floormats, Grand Edition badges and the Premium and Driver Assistance packages. Mercedes will produce 100 SL450 Grand Editions and 100 SL550 Grand Editions.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe SL comes with features not found on many other cars. The power-retractable roof can be raised or lowered while the car is moving at up to 25 mph. When the top is up, an available panoramic glass section can automatically change from dark to transparent. An available active suspension adjusts to reduce body roll in corners and lowers automatically at high speeds.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class?\n\nThe SL roadster has been coddling Mercedes customers for more than 60 years, and though it doesn’t rank in the same performance league as the Porsche 911, the SL550 is hardly a boulevard cruiser. All in all, the SL offers elegant surroundings and enough verve to keep most drivers entertained.",
