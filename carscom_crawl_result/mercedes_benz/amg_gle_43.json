      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is a mid-size luxury SUV that seats up to five people and is available in traditional SUV or four-door coupe form. It comes standard with a 302-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, as well as performance-oriented AMG variants making as much as 577 hp. Competitors include the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q7 and BMW X5.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThere are no significant changes. A redesigned GLE-Class is slated to debut as a 2020 model.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Are Most Important?\n\nThe GLE-Class comes standard with technology features like remote start and 4G LTE Wi-Fi internet connectivity. Performance-minded shoppers have two grades to consider: the 385-hp AMG GLE 43 or the AMG GLE 63, which makes 550 hp (577 hp in S guise).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class?\n\nThe four-door coupe body style is a twist on the traditional SUV look, but the design compromises visibility, backseat access and cargo space in the name of style. With a redesigned 2020 GLE-Class on the way, there's a chance there may be deals on the 2019 version.",
