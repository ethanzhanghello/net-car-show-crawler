      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A5, BMW 4 Series, fiscal responsibility\n\nLooks like: A combination of the C- and E-Class coupes and cabriolets\n\nPowertrain: 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (300) or 375-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder (450); nine-speed automatic; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Early 2024\n\nCoupe and cabriolet body styles were notably absent from the most recent redesigns of Mercedes-Benz’s C- and E-Class cars, and now we know why: They were busy doing the fusion dance behind closed doors to become the all-new 2024 CLE coupe and cabriolet. With standard all-wheel drive and the same four-cylinder and six-cylinder mild-hybrid powertrains found in the E-Class, the CLE aims to serve the dwindling market for two-door, gas-powered cars as Mercedes-Benz continues its transition toward an all-electric future.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nDespite its all-new status, the CLE doesn’t bring a lot of innovation to the table. It boasts new front styling, a new front-seat design and, in a first for Mercedes-Benz, “the front seats are unlocked with an elegant loop made of Nappa leather conveniently located at the upper edge of the backrest of the front seats.” Mercedes calls this feature Easy-Entry. We’ve seen the technology inside before, though the infotainment adds a few trick features.\n\nNew Styling\n\nThe CLE is bigger in every major measurement than the outgoing C-Class coupe, and while it’s slightly longer than the E-Class coupe, in most other measurements, it’s nearly identical or slightly smaller. Up front, it wears a new grille design with a three-dimensional pattern as well as unique LED headlights. The silhouette is strikingly similar to both the C- and E-Class coupes, which isn’t a bad thing, as both were rather handsome. In back, two-part taillights and large exhaust finishers in the rear bumper contribute to the CLE’s athletic appearance. A variety of 18-, 19- and 20-inch wheels will be available.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNot-So-New Powertrains\n\nUnder the hood of the CLE are very familiar mild-hybrid powerplants. The base CLE300 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 255 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The CLE450 gets a 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine that makes 375 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines have a boost feature that allows for an additional 23 hp and 148 pounds-feet for short periods. All CLE models will come standard with all-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The CLE also sits 0.6 inch lower than its sedan siblings when equipped with either its standard comfort suspension or optional stiffer sport suspension; the latter adds sportier steering, as well.\n\nNew Front Seats Highlight the Interior\n\nSimilar to its exterior dimensions, the CLE’s interior is roomier than the C-Class coupe but in most respects smaller than the two-door E-Class. Up front, a new seat design aims for a combination of comfort and sportiness with what Mercedes calls “avant garde” design. Audiophiles should enjoy the two speakers that are integrated into each of the front seats, as well.\n\nA 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and 11.9-inch touchscreen display are the technological highlights, including the latest version of the MBUX user interface. Mercedes also touts the system’s artificial intelligence capabilities, including its ability to recognize frequent user actions and when they occur, and then automate those actions in similar scenarios at similar times. A new Android-specific interface allows for additional third-party apps, while some (e.g.,TikTok) come installed.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Earns IIHS Top Safety Pick+ Rating\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: Redesigned to Combine Luxury and New Tech\nFour-Spot Four-Pot: New Mercedes-AMG SL43 Puts a Four-Cylinder in the Flagship Convertible\nMercedes Reveals Pricing for 2023 AMG C43, Starts at $61,050\n2023 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 Review: Fresher but Still Frustrating\nPricing and Release Date\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe and Cabriolet | Manufacturer image\n\nMercedes says the new CLE will go on sale in early 2024, and we expect to learn pricing as that time gets closer. Expect it to be priced from somewhere in the $60,000 range, between the C-Class coupe’s roughly $50,000 starting price and the base E-Class coupe’s $70,000-odd price tag.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Having just undertaken the monumental task of merging the compact C-Class and mid-size E-Class coupes into one vehicle for the 2024 model year (a Dr. Frankenstein-esque process, but with more artistry in the finished product), Mercedes-Benz is mostly leaving the resultant CLE alone for 2025. The only changes are a new Sun Yellow paint color and an available synthetic-leather steering wheel for an animal-free interior. The AMG CLE53 gets a new cabriolet version, plus a new available 20-inch wheel design in gray or black.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mercedes-AMG CLE53 Cabriolet: 443-HP, All-Wheel-Drive Convertible\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE is available as a coupe or convertible with standard 4Matic all-wheel drive, and it’s on sale now. Full pricing (including $1,150 destination charge) is as follows:\n\nCoupe\nCLE300: $59,150\nCLE450: $68,600\nAMG CLE53: $75,450\nConvertible\nCLE300: $67,600\nCLE450: $76,950\nAMG CLE53: $83,750\nWhat Are the 2025 CLE Trim Levels?\n\nAs it’s a Mercedes-Benz derived in part from the sumptuous E-Class, it should come as no surprise that the CLE comes with a lengthy list of standard equipment. The base CLE300 rides on 18-inch wheels (the CLE450 and AMG 53 get 19s), and regardless of engine or body style, all CLEs include LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated washer nozzles, and keyless entry and start. Coupes get a panoramic moonroof, and a wind deflector and the Airscarf neck-level heat vents extend the top-down season for convertible buyers.\n\nThe interior features standard synthetic leather upholstery, power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and 64-color ambient lighting. Cabin tech includes wireless phone charging, a Burmester 3D surround-sound audio system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 11.9-inch infotainment touchscreen with navigation and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEvery version of the CLE is also available with a Pinnacle Trim Package, which adds upgraded headlights, augmented reality navigation, a head-up display and a 360-degree camera system. The Pinnacle Trim Package costs $2,600 on the 300 and 450, but $2,500 and $2,300 on the AMG coupe and convertible, respectively, as they already include the 360-degree camera system as standard equipment.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nOther than the surround-view camera system, the AMG and non-AMG CLEs have the same standard safety tech, including forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, a driver attention monitor, automatic high beams and automated parking. The $1,950 Driver Assistance Package is available across the lineup and adds adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, automatic lane changes, front cross-traffic alert, lane-centering steering, emergency steering assist and road-sign recognition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE300 Coupe Review: The Merits of Calmness\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE Coupe and Cabriolet: 2 Become 1\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nResearch the Mercedes-Benz CLE300\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2025 CLE Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLE is available with three engines, all of which are backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission and the aforementioned AWD. A mild-hybrid 255-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for 295 pounds-feet of torque propels the CLE300. It returns an EPA-estimated 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined in the coupe and 23/32/26 mpg in the convertible.\n\nThe CLE450 and AMG CLE53 both use a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. In the CLE450, output is 375 hp and 369 pounds-feet of torque; it’s rated at 23/33/26 mpg as a coupe and 23/32/26 mpg as a convertible. In the AMG, an electrically powered turbo helps amp output up to 443 hp and 413 pounds-feet, with an overboost function increasing torque to 443 pounds-feet for short 10-second bursts.
