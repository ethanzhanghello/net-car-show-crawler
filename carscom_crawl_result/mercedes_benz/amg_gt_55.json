      "expert_review": "Monterey Car Week in California is likely the nation’s largest gathering of moneyed car geeks — an appropriate venue, then, to debut a new luxury sports car. Mercedes-AMG, the fabled German automaker’s in-house performance arm, took advantage of the 2023 gathering to roll out the new generation of its GT coupe after a three-year hiatus. We already had sufficient technical detail to be excited about the 2024 AMG GT coupe, but now Mercedes has filled in the last important blank: The car will start at $136,050 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: A Return for the EQ-Avoidant\n\nPowertrain Specs and 0-60 MPH\n\nThe 2024 AMG GT coupe gets two versions of the same engine. In the AMG GT55, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine generates 469 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes says the GT55 can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.8 seconds and hit a top speed of 183 mph. In the GT63, improved airflow and increased turbo boost amp output up to 577 hp and 590 pounds-feet. The additional power shortens the GT63’s sprint to 60 mph to just 3.1 seconds, and its top speed stretches to 196 mph. Both engines send their power through a nine-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels.\n\nStandard Performance Tech\n\nThe standard 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system continuously varies torque distribution, never sending more than 50% of available power to the front wheels but directing all of the power rearward in Drift mode. Drift mode is just one aspect of the AMG Dynamic Plus Package, which is also included on every AMG GT. The package additionally features an electronically controlled limited-slip differential and active engine mounts that can vary their firmness to isolate occupants from the engine’s vibrations for comfortable cruising or tighten up for quicker handling response during performance driving.\n\nOther standard equipment on the AMG GT includes rear-axle steering, active aerodynamics and AMG Active Ride Control, which features active roll stabilization to keep the body level during hard cornering.\n\nVast Personalization Menu\n\nAMG is offering 11 exterior paint colors on the GT, including six added-cost Manufaktur finishes. Numerous 20- and 21-inch wheels are available, as are nine upholstery options (seven of them Nappa leather and the remaining two Nappa leather with microfiber inserts). Naturally, there are multiple trim options, as well as available sport seats.\n\nBuyers looking for a more aggressive look can spec the optional AMG Aerodynamics Package, which adds air deflectors front and rear, a larger rear diffuser, and a fixed wing in place of the standard active spoiler. Also adding the AMG Carbon Fiber Package renders some of those bits — and the sill panel inserts, mirror housings and front splitter — in exposed carbon fiber.\n\nOf particular interest to buyers building out that last package is the available front-axle lift system to help the nose clear driveway transitions and speed bumps. Not only does it raise the nose 1.2 inches, but it’s tied into the GPS to “remember” obstacles and automatically raise the nose when encountering them again.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT coupe will arrive at dealerships in the spring. The GT55 will have a starting price of $136,050, and the GT63 will start at $177,050. Relative to the most expensive vehicle to sell at auction during Car Week, though — a 1967 Ferrari 412P Berlinetta that hammered for more than $30 million — its sticker seems reasonable.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMercedes-AMG GT Coupe, Roadster Go Stealth (but by No Means Stealthy) for 2021\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe: 5 Standout Features in This Standout Car\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R Pro: Not for Amateurs\n2020 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster: Test-Drive Video\n2022 Mercedes-AMG GT53 4-Door Review: A Stylish Compromise\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT is a performance-oriented luxury car that can be had in two-door coupe and coupelike four-door sedan body styles. The coupe rejoined the line in redesigned form last year, but the four-door’s core design dates back to the 2019 model year. The AMG GT’s broad range of turbocharged powertrains starts with a 416-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and tops out with a plug-in hybrid V-8 that produces up to 831 hp. \n\nOnly the AMG GT43 coupe offers rear-wheel drive; all other variants come standard with all-wheel drive. The coupe offers a choice of the turbocharged four-cylinder or twin-turbocharged V-8s with outputs ranging from 469 to 603 hp. The sedan’s entry-level engine is a 362-hp, turbocharged and supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six; twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8s similar to those available in the coupe are also optional in the sedan. This Mercedes’ plug-in hybrid V-8 powertrain churns out 805 hp in the coupe and 831 hp in the sedan.\n\nThe AMG GT’s rivals include the Audi RS7, BMW M5 and M8, Chevrolet Corvette, Lexus LC 500 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nThe AMG GT coupe fleshes out its model lineup with the addition of the four-cylinder GT43, a track-focused GT63 Pro and GT63 S E Performance plug-in hybrid versions for 2025. The AMG GT sedan is unchanged save for a couple new color choices.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nBurmester surround-sound stereo\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\n11.9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n19-inch alloy wheels\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\n64-color ambient interior lighting\nMultiple USB-C charge ports\n“Hey Mercedes” voice command system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nSurround-view camera system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRear-wheel steering\nFront-axle lift system\nAdaptive suspension\nCarbon ceramic brakes\nUpgraded exterior aero trim\nNavigation with augmented reality overlay\nHead-up display\nNappa leather upholstery\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nMore heavily bolstered front sport seats\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-AMG GT?\n\nYou certainly won’t fade into the background when behind the wheel of either the AMG GT coupe or sedan. Their dramatic design is a huge draw, though the sedan is arguably the more sensible choice if you sometimes need your car to be practical. Rear seats are optional in the coupe, though the only thing you’d want to put in them are shopping bags or luggage. The base coupe’s turbocharged four-cylinder and the turbocharged inline-six in the sedan should satisfy most luxury-car shoppers. Still, it’s hard to resist the allure of the available twin-turbo V-8s, particularly the shatteringly fast plug-in hybrid versions: Mercedes-Benz estimates the AMG GT63 S E Performance can rocket from 0-60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds. Just be careful to budget for gasoline — or potential speeding tickets — because those top trims can double the price of this already-six-figures-to-start car.",
