      "expert_review": "Front-wheel drive is standard on the CLA250, and Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel drive is optional. We cover the high-performance version of this car, the AMG CLA45, separately on Cars.com; compare the two cars here. Mercedes refreshed the CLA250 for 2017 with updated styling, an upgraded multimedia system and a few more important standard features. Stack the car up versus the 2016 CLA250 here. We tested an all-wheel-drive CLA250.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nMercedes markets the CLA250 as a four-door coupe, but don’t be fooled. It’s a sedan, however swoopy. The styling remains a shrunken take on the larger CLS-Class, Mercedes-Benz’s other coupe-like sedan, but I still find the results too gumdrop-shaped. Decide for yourself.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard; 18s are optional. Mercedes-Benz restyled the CLA250’s bumpers for 2017, and you can alter them even more with sportier cosmetic packages. Outfitted as such, the bumpers have new, continuous framework that emulates the styling on Mercedes’ AMG models. It’s far better than last year’s CLA250, whose sport packages festooned the car’s nose with comically gaping portals.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDespite the turbocharged four-cylinder engine’s stout 208 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque, excessive drivetrain lag sullies the Mercedes-Benz CLA250. A sustained toe on the gas can induce gratifying low-end punch, where the little Benz surges ahead even at 2,000 rpm. The problem, however, is getting to all that.\n\nThe CLA 250 delays accelerator response to begin with, and the engine adds a degree of old-school turbo lag that others have largely banished. In its normal driving modes, the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission resists kickdown with all the stubbornness of a toddler in a vegetable standoff, and it occasionally bogs down mid-shift, as well. Sportier driving modes mitigate this by holding lower gears, but they don’t address the accelerator or turbo lag. The Mercedes-Benz CLA250 is eventually quick, but calling up that power is an exercise in patience.\n\nTo drive the CLA is also an exercise in tolerance. Wind noise is low, but road noise is a constant, low din at highway speeds. And even with the optional adaptive suspension in our test vehicle set to its comfort-oriented modes, the CLA 250 encountered bumps with a degree of chop unbecoming of a luxury car at any price. One caveat: Our test car had 18-inch wheels with low-profile tires; the higher-profile tires on the standard 17-inch wheels might improve ride quality.\n\nAt any rate, the handling payoff is mixed. Understeer is as controlled as you can expect for any front-drive-based chassis, and overall body roll is limited. But steering feedback is vague on initial immediacy, with an overall ratio that’s too slow for nimble direction changes. Our test car lacked Mercedes-Benz’s optional Sport Package Plus, however, which adds a performance suspension, retuned steering and new logic for the transmission’s Sport mode — changes that affect ride, handling and acceleration, no doubt.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz’s cabin is narrow, with a prominent center console that limits knee space. Headroom is tight with the optional panoramic moonroof, which sacrifices 1.2 inches of front headroom; taller shoppers need not apply. The front seats have long adjustment range, at least, but it’s moot if you have adults in back. With a low seating position and modest legroom at best, the backseat will have them begging you to move forward.\n\nVisibility is another strike. The CLA’s low windshield, squat A-pillars and tiny rear window (significantly obstructed by the rear head restraints) limit the view in all directions.\n\nCabin quality is a step above the non-luxury fray, but inconsistency abounds. Materials are rich in certain places only to drop off a cliff elsewhere, from expanses of economy-car plastic to cheap-feeling door-lock stems and rickety climate vents. The same is characteristic of Mercedes-Benz’s competitors: Entry-luxury sedans like the Audi A3 and Acura ILX likewise sacrifice quality to meet price levels. But similar money to the Mercedes-Benz CLA250 can buy an entry-level sedan higher up the luxury ladder — think BMW 320i, Acura TLX or Volvo S60 — where interiors stand head and shoulders above the CLA and its ilk.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nAn 8-inch multimedia screen is standard for 2017 (it was optional before), with a center-console knob to control the action. Some editors dislike Mercedes’ menu structure, called Comand, but I find the three-tiered layout intuitive. The controller doubles as a tuning knob and a separate volume knob sits prominently among the center controls. Best of all, the CLA250 still has plenty of physical buttons, including stereo presets. Amid many automakers’ flight to capacitive touch-sensitive controls, or even just a lot fewer physical buttons, Mercedes-Benz remains a holdout. Stay the course, Stuttgart.\n\nBluetooth phone and audio streaming, HD radio and a USB port are standard. Options include a navigation system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Harman Kardon premium audio and subscription-based in-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLA250’s trunk measures a reasonable 13.1 cubic feet; a 60/40-split folding backseat with a center pass-through is standard. A powered trunk lid with foot activation is optional.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 CLA250 has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Mercedes’ Attention Assist drowsy-driver detection system is standard, as are rain-sensing wipers and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A backup camera is newly standard (finally) for 2017, too. Full-speed adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe front-drive CLA250 starts at just over $33,000 including destination charge. It comes reasonably equipped at that, with the 8-inch multimedia display, automatic emergency braking and power front seats with memory settings all standard. At the other end, an all-wheel-drive CLA250 tops out around $53,000 if you load it to the hilt with performance, luxury and cosmetic upgrades.\n\nThat’s a big spread, and the alternative choices depend upon where in that range your budget lands. But entry-level luxury sedans are a niche group on the whole and mainstream brands like BMW, Cadillac, Lexus and Volvo have avoided the class altogether, instead opting for stripped-down versions of their larger, mainstream sport sedans to compete for your $350-a-month lease payment. Bargain alternatives like the Acura ILX and Buick Verano, meanwhile, can save you thousands at the other end.\n\nSuch is the position of the CLA-Class, an entry-level Mercedes with significant improvements for 2017 but still too many drawbacks to justify its cost versus other vehicles that $35,000 can buy. The styling and brand cachet will win some fans, as will the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45’s raucous performance. But for many shoppers, better vehicle options exist.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Like expensive ladies’ footwear or haute couture fashion clothing, looking good means suffering a little discomfort.\n\nVersus the competition: The BMW 228i Gran Coupe is almost a carbon copy of the CLA250 — stylish, cramped, not overly quick and expensive. \n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that the idea of a front-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz would have been sacrilegious to fans of the brand. True luxury-brand cars were supposed to have rear-wheel drive, and while the Japanese brands — like Acura and Infiniti — began to change some of those perceptions, the Germans steadfastly stood their ground. But you can’t hold back the tide forever, and after Audi survived its foray into front-drive cars, Mercedes-Benz and BMW eventually gave in and started coming up with front-wheel-drive models of their own. The cars slot into entry-level positions in the automakers’ lineups at relative bargain prices, allowing new generations of buyers to get into a luxury brand earlier in life. \n\nThe CLA-Class is meant to appeal to those buyers, people just starting an ownership journey that Mercedes-Benz hopes will become a lifelong relationship. Starting these buyers off in something relatively inexpensive, undeniably stylish and packed with the same kinds of amenities as much larger and more expensive models seems a good bet. The refreshed 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 4Matic you see here is meant to be exactly the hook that drags in today’s catch.\n\nRelated: 2020 BMW 228 Gran Coupe Review: Little, and of Little Point\n\nStylish to a Fault\n\nWhat immediately hooks passersby is the CLA’s style. Under the skin, it’s almost identical to the A-Class sedan Mercedes brought to the U.S. for the first time in 2019, but the bodywork is unique to the CLA. It’s another example of the controversial “four-door coupe” the German brands keep trying to convince the world is a real thing. Since two-door coupes have fallen out of favor globally, the hope is the styling of a two-door with the convenience of a four-door will prove popular; it hasn’t sold in great numbers, but for people interested in looks over functionality, it works. And there’s no denying it does look good — swoopy and low, with a squat greenhouse and long roofline that makes it look racy and fast. The comparable A-Class sedan also looks good but has a much more formal, upright roofline, enabling the backseat to be used by fully formed adult humans. The CLA, not so much.\n\nThe first problem with the CLA’s space is getting in and out. Because this is a four-door with not a whole lot of room between the wheels, the B-pillar is quite far forward. It makes it challenging to get in and out of the front seats, as you have to pull yourself around that B-pillar that sits forward of your left shoulder. It’s a bit of a contortionist’s act, requiring you to duck under the steeply raked windshield and low roofline and still make it around that thick B-pillar. And when you want to get out, you almost have to physically pull yourself out of the car. The backseat isn’t any better: Not only is the door opening tight, but the roofline is low and there’s barely any legroom. This car really should have been a two-door coupe; longer front doors with the B-pillar moved back a good 6 inches would have made for a much more comfortable experience. The rear seats are vestigial and unlikely to be used often anyway; may as well relegate them to “sometimes” status rather than worrying about making them so accessible. \n\nAt least it has decent cargo room. The trunk is a trunk, not a hatchback, but it holds the most cargo of any of its immediate competitors. The CLA is rated at 13.1 cubic feet of trunk space, while the BMW 228i Gran Coupe comes in at 12.0 cubic feet. On the smaller end are the Audi A3 Quattro (10.0 cubic feet) and Cadillac’s new CT4 (10.7 cubic feet). The Benz is big enough to fit a full-size suitcase, and with its folding rear seats, it’s a usable compartment. \n\nThankfully, despite how cramped the CLA’s interior is, it truly is a premium cabin and a pleasant place to be. Materials are best-in-class, and none of the switches or controls look like they’ve been pulled from lesser-brand vehicles, as you’ll see in some Lexus, Genesis and Cadillac models. Everything looks, feels and actuates with the same premium precision you’ll find in Mercedes-Benz’s bigger, more expensive models, such as the E-Class or even the S-Class. \n\n2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nThe design looks fantastic, as well, with a modern look to the twin-screen dashboard that feels fully 21st century in its execution. It’s loaded with the same Mercedes-Benz User Experience multimedia system you’ll find in the brand’s more expensive cars, featuring the same slick operation and augmented-reality features for its navigation system. It also features the same annoying accidental activations of the “Hey Mercedes” verbal command functions, so you’re not actually able to say the word “Mercedes” in the car without it loudly responding, “Beep — how can I help you?” This leads to inevitable cursing as you spend 10 seconds trying to get the system to cancel itself and go back to sleep. This annoying, recurring feature, along with Mercedes-Benz’s continuing desire to make its steering-wheel controls increasingly difficult to use properly, are the only two bugaboos in the car’s multimedia functions — and they’re not unique to the CLA-Class by any means. \n\nFun to Drive, Mostly\n\nPowering the CLA250 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a healthy 221 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s enough to really move the CLA250 4Matic when you call for some acceleration or passing power. That said, it’s on the low end of the output spectrum versus competitors like the BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe, the Cadillac CT4 and the Audi A3 Quattro, but only the Audi is lighter; the other models are heavier. The bigger problem is that the CLA’s power is delivered through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that feels terrible. I’d hoped this would have been addressed with the recent refresh of the car, as it’s the same behavior I noted in the original CLA a few years ago, but it hasn’t been improved. At low speeds, it feels like there are rubber bands connecting the accelerator to the rest of the car: Press the gas and it takes a half-step to wind up and start moving. \n\nComing to a stop and then accelerating again, the weird lag and delay become troublesome, making it difficult to drive smoothly — as evidenced by the bobbing of passengers’ heads. Sport mode doesn’t help any; it just keeps the transmission in a lower gear, making the car feel more frenetic and jumpy. Once speeds have moved into higher ranges (say, for highway duty), the transmission performs just fine. It’s just the slow-speed, around-town behavior that’s very difficult to dial in smoothly. A conventional automatic transmission or a manual shifter would likely be a lot more pleasant. \n\nI have no complaints with the ride and handling, however. The CLA’s chassis tuning is superb — it feels like a bigger, more substantial, heavier car. That’s not to say it isn’t nimble and agile as is. The steering feel and feedback are excellent (and adjustable), and you could feel how well damped the suspension is over Michigan’s broken and cratered roads. It’s the combination of the classy, upscale interior and sophisticated body control that sell the car, helping drivers overlook the cramped environs, fussy multimedia controls and funky transmission behavior. \n\nFuel economy isn’t too shabby, either. It’s rated 23/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined for the 4Matic all-wheel-drive model and 25/35/28 mpg for the front-wheel-drive base model. My week with the car covered a couple of hundred miles and returned a respectable 28.7 mpg combined, beating the combined rating for the AWD version. The 228i xDrive Gran Coupe, itself a front-wheel-drive-based AWD four-door coupe with a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine and eight-speed automatic transmission, is rated an identical 23/33/27 mpg. You could make a case for the Audi A3 Quattro being thrown into this group even though it’s really more a competitor for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class; for reference’s sake, it’s rated 22/30/25 mpg. As one would expect with high-powered turbocharged four-cylinder engines, premium fuel is recommended for all of these models except the A3, which uses regular. \n\nSafety Tech — for a Price\n\nAs is typical with a lot of German luxury brand cars, a stunning amount of semi-autonomous driving aids and safety technology is available — if you’re willing to pay for it. Systems that are becoming standard in mass-market vehicles are still optional in most of the luxury classes, either out of some confusing idea that some people just don’t want certain items or merely the fact that manufacturers can get away with it. \n\nThe CLA comes with forward automatic brake assist, keyless start, an attention monitor and a backup camera — but distance-keeping cruise control, active brake assist with cross-traffic function, active steering assist, blind spot assist, lane keep assist and more are all lumped into an expensive option package. Automatic parallel and perpendicular parking assist are also extra. \n\nThe 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety at the time of writing.\n\nThe Question of Value\n\nStarting price for the 2020 CLA250 4Matic is $39,645 (including destination). My test car included a whopping $13,545 in options, some of which you could easily forgo ($720 for blue paint, $1,950 for the AMG Line styling package, $310 for 64-color ambient lighting) and some of which frankly should be standard equipment in a car this expensive ($2,250 for a Driver Assistance Package, $1,030 for heated and ventilated seats). But what’s most egregious is that keyless entry isn’t standard. That’s right: Keyless start is but not keyless entry, meaning you still have to pull the fob out of your pocket to unlock the doors before putting it back in your pocket to start the car. I find it another offensive example of luxury brands charging for things that more often than not come standard in lesser brand models — and it’s especially offensive when it comes to electronic safety equipment. \n\nThe CLA’s competition isn’t any better in this regard, but all of them do start out cheaper. Least expensive is the Audi A3 Quattro, which rings in $2,150 less than a CLA250 4Matic and includes keyless entry and a real leather interior versus the CLA’s (and every other competitor’s) faux leather. The Mercedes’ most direct competitor, BMW’s 228i xDrive, starts at $38,495, while the AWD Cadillac CT4 Sport, a newcomer to the party that replaced the ATS, is closest in price at $39,590. None of the CLA’s competitors have an interior as nicely trimmed as the CLA’s, but all feel similar in terms of being cramped and limited. Evidently, the idea is that you must suffer for your style, like those expensive high heels or haute couture fashion. If you’re cool with that, the CLA will fit into your wardrobe nicely. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mercedes-Benz’s latest effort at entry-luxury sedans comes with the A-Class, a global nameplate that makes its U.S. debut starting in early 2019. Wait, what? Yes: Amid consumer preference for SUVs, luxury brands are still investing in small sedans — or, at least, Mercedes is. The A-Class heralds an overhauled small-car platform that will soon underpin redesigns of the swoopy CLA-Class sedan and GLA-Class SUV. It’s easily an all-around better choice than the current CLA, which will remain in our market, though a few annoyances stop the A-Class short of a clean “A” grade.\n\nRelated: Here’s Our Full Preview of the All-New 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class\n\nOffered outside the U.S. for three prior generations as only a hatchback, the A-Class now adds a sedan, which is the only body style we’ll get when it hits dealerships in early 2019. It comes initially as the A220, available with front- or all-wheel drive (4Matic). I drove both drivelines at a press preview in Seattle (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our lodging and airfare to such automaker-sponsored events).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe A220 carries a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 188 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque. It works through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and the combination makes for punchier acceleration than the modest output specs suggest. The automatic transmission delays occasionally on multigear downshifts, but most of the time it gets you to the right gear with little hesitation, and the engine delivers gratifying, continuous oomph from 3,000 rpm on up. The A220 is not quick — something Mercedes will address with at least one AMG variant — but both FWD and AWD variants are quick enough to pass slower highway traffic with power to spare, and they get there with little of the CLA250’s hesitation.\n\nAll vehicles during the media drive had the A220’s optional 19-inch wheels and AMG Line Package, which has some rejiggered bodywork and a slightly lower suspension, though Mercedes claims the suspension has similar tuning as cars without AMG Line effects. As such, shock absorption is controlled but firm, and highway isolation is busy over anything but glass-smooth pavement; it improves on the CLA’s outright harshness, but some shoppers may want better high-speed isolation. The optional adaptive shock absorbers or smaller wheels (17- and 18-inchers are available) with higher-profile tires might improve on this, but I didn’t drive any vehicles thus equipped — and Mercedes offers the smaller wheels exclusively with run-flat tires, a style of rubber that can sacrifice some ride quality. Test-drive a few variants and decide for yourself.\n\nThe handling payoff comes in minimal body roll as well as good grip and limited understeer in tight corners, though it’s hard to discern how much of that came from our test cars’ high-performance summer tires versus any inherent balance. Still, steering feels like the weak link: Fling the A-Class into a tight corner and the wheel feels a touch soupy at first, the initial ratio too slow for quick directional changes and with numb feedback at any steering angle. On the highway, the steering requires constant, tentative corrections to stay on course. Get an A-Class with the optional driver assistance packages and Mercedes’ lane-centering steering at least alleviates the on-center fuss by doing most of the work for you. It works all the way down to a stop, as does the optional adaptive cruise control; full-speed forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is standard.\n\nCLAss Warfare\n\nMany comparisons will be made between the A-Class and the CLA-Class, notwithstanding Mercedes’ insistence on calling the latter a four-door coupe — an oxymoronic marketing term that’s maybe just moronic. The two sedans occupy the same class, but Mercedes-Benz officials insist the CLA is sticking around. For A-Class shoppers, the split probably helps; with no demands for coupelike design, the A-Class looks like a proper sedan, free of the CLA’s lengthier overhangs and droopy profile. A slightly longer wheelbase on a body that’s 3.2 inches shorter overall ensures short, crisp overhangs at both ends. The standard LED headlights point check-mark accents toward the grille, a fresh look that should spread across the Mercedes lineup soon. The rear is the sole letdown — derivative taillights, bulbous bumpers — but it’s hardly an eyesore.\n\nInside, the CLA exhibited obvious cost-cutting for a car that wears the three-pointed star, affordability notwithstanding. The A-Class improves on some areas and cuts costs in others, but the overall sense is that Mercedes put the money where it counts. Lusher padding envelops areas your arms and elbows touch, and low-budget plastics stay mostly out of sight. Save for some cheap finishes on the steering-column stalks and window switches, this feels strategically premium.\n\nThe front seats have impressive adjustment range and standard power adjustments for both sides, but knee space between the center console and doors is narrow. Those who like to adjust the seat high will run out of headroom under the standard panoramic moonroof, and height-adjustable seat belts and extending sun visors are both missing. The standard MB-Tex vinyl upholstery has a rubbery, industrial consistency, and the heavy seat bolsters feel too stiff for long-haul comfort. Mercedes’ optional cowhide accompanies stitched accents on the dash and upper doors, but neither upgrade feels all that lush — nor do they ease up on the bolsters. Save the money and stick with MB-Tex.\n\nBackseat space is workable but snug, with a low bench that consigns adults to a squatting position. The head restraints go only partway down, leaving big obstructions in the short rear window. The windshield is short, too, so prepare to crane your neck for overhead stoplights.\n\nMBUX at No Extra Bucks\n\nStandard in the A-Class is a pair of conjoined rectangular displays similar to what you get in the current E-Class and S-Class. The differences end beyond that: No dashboard hood encircles either screen, and the right-side unit is, at long last, a touchscreen — a layout preferred by consumers but long resisted among German luxury brands. In the A-Class, it all works off a new MBUX multimedia system (that’s Mercedes-Benz User Experience), which has a voice recognition feature you can summon by saying, “Hey, Mercedes.”\n\nThe voice recognition works as advertised, altering vehicle settings or finding contextual locations along your navigation route through conversational questions. The contextual locations in particular are a capability long offered by smartphones but seldom in-car voice recognition systems, which have largely failed such basic tasks for years. Beware, however: Casual references to Mercedes — or sometimes other words — can prompt unsolicited interjections from the system. Should it become too intrusive, you can deactivate the summoning feature and access voice recognition discreetly through a steering-wheel button.\n\nThe other shoe drops on music, as MBUX’s voice recognition doesn’t play ball with streaming tunes. It might be Friday night, but you can’t call up that Friday Night Jams playlist off your smartphone or Spotify account through the Mercedes. Future over-the-air updates to the built-in system could streamline the integration, but for now, you’ll have to plug the phone into Apple CarPlay or Android Auto — both standard, albeit not the wireless connection some automakers now offer — and query Google or Siri for those superfly beats. (Is that what the kids say these days? No? Bah.)\n\nThe base MBUX system has two 7-inch screens, five USB-C connectors and an adapter cable for older USB formats. Dual 10.25-inch screens and an upgraded processing chip for faster menu responses are optional, as is an onboard navigation system with nifty turn-by-turn directional markers overlaid in augmented reality on a forward-facing camera view. An onboard internet connection with a 10-year complementary subscription enables cloud-based learning and over-the-air updates, while the onboard software learns your favorite radio stations or routes driven to suggest them at contextual times — both similar to the way smartphones work.\n\nAn Entry-Level Benz Worth Entering?\n\nMercedes-Benz has yet to release pricing as of this writing, but it bills the A-Class as the new entry point into the brand. That means the sedan should start somewhere south of the CLA’s current price — about $34,000 with destination. It should pack significant value at that: MBUX and automatic emergency braking are standard, as are the moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control and power seats. Options range from the upgraded MBUX system to navigation, 64-color ambient lighting, Burmester premium audio, keyless access with hands-free trunk opening, heated and ventilated front seats, and a heated steering wheel.\n\nA redesigned CLA-Class will soon accompany the A-Class, as will a GLA-Class micro-SUV; all three will share the same underpinnings, Mercedes officials told me. If the A-Class is a harbinger of small things to come from Mercedes-Benz, it means big improvements loom for some of the brand’s weakest current offerings, and it all starts here. The A-Class is far from perfect, but it’s a good start.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nThe cheapest car in Mercedes’ lineup, the CLA-Class is the brand’s gateway sedan, with vogue “coupe” styling and an expressive interior design that belie its entry-level positioning. Its powertrain lineup starts with a 221-horsepower four-cylinder in the front-wheel-drive CLA250 and the all-wheel-drive 250 4Matic, climbing to a 302-hp four-cylinder in the AMG CLA35, which comes standard with AWD. Atop the lineup is the AWD, 416-hp CLA45 S. CLA-Class competitors include the Acura Integra, Audi A3, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Cadillac CT4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nWith an all-new CLA-Class coming for 2026 — including an all-electric version as well as a hybrid version — the CLA sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n10.25-inch digital instrument panel\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nAutomated parking\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAdaptive dampers\nNavigation\nAugmented reality navigation\nHeated front seats\n12-speaker Burmester sound system\nHead-up display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot intervention\nEmergency steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nDespite its sporty appearance, the Mercedes-Benz CLA comports itself with all the refinement and comfort of a bigger Benz sedan — or at least non-AMG variants do. The AMG models ride on a stiffer suspension that’s cinched down for sharper handling. Both the regular and AMG models fulfill their missions admirably, but backseat space is snug — and many competitors are more affordable.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nThe five-seat Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class is an entry-level subcompact luxury car with coupe-like styling. It has a standard 208-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. It's offered with front- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the Audi A3 and BMW 2 Series. Mercedes also sells the performance-oriented AMG CLA 45, which has a 375-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and standard all-wheel drive.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include an 8-inch dashboard screen, dual-zone air conditioning and keyless start. Options include an adaptive suspension, a panoramic moonroof, blind spot warning and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class?\n\nThe CLA-Class' starting price is appealing, but you pay in other ways; visibility is poor, the cabin is cramped, the ride is busy and there's some low-grade interior trim. Mercedes' own C-Class compact sedan, by comparison, is a much more well-rounded luxury car — albeit a more expensive one.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi A3, BMW 2 Series, Lexus IS 350\nLooks like: A refreshed version of the current CLA\nPowertrains: 221- (250) or 302-horsepower (AMG CLA35), turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 48-volt mild-hybrid assist or 416-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (AMG CLA45 S); eight speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; front- or all-wheel drive\nHits dealerships: Late 2023\nMercedes-Benz is giving a mid-cycle update to the CLA Coupe for the 2024 model year that’s highlighted by the introduction of mild-hybrid powertrains to further the company’s broader electrification effort. The interior has been reworked, too, with an all-new infotainment screen paired to an identically sized digital instrument cluster.\nRelated: 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA250: 6 Things We Like (and 5 Not So Much)\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Electrification Adds Jolt to CLA Performance\nThe 2024 CLA Coupe still comes with turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines, but the automaker has added 48-volt mild-hybrid assist to both the base CLA250 and more performance-oriented AMG CLA35.\nWhile total output for the CLA250 remains at 221 horsepower, the generator provides a 13-hp boost in certain situations and allows owners to coast with the engine off. An eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is still the default transmission, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive optional. The CLA35 gets the same mild-hybrid system as the CLA250, but output is up to 302 hp. At the top end of the lineup lies the CLA45, which has dropped the standard variant for 2024 in favor of the CLA45 S; it benefits from an updated version of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and makes 416 hp, a gain of 34 hp over the previous CLA45. Both AMG variants come with AWD only.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Updated Looks\nMercedes chose to give the CLA Coupe a mild facelift, featuring redesigned LED headlights, a revamped front grille and a tweaked front bumper. Around back, a new rear diffuser design complements newly standard LED taillights. The AMG lineup follows suit with the rest of the upgrades, as the interiors mirror the 250’s updates (albeit with higher-quality materials and racier accents). Several new upholstery options will be available, and buyers will still benefit from the AMG Performance steering wheel.\nStandard and Optional Safety Tech\nIn addition to its styling and performance upgrades, the 2024 CLA Coupe also gets an upgraded suite of driver-assist technology. The latest version of the Parking Package is standard and uses a 360-degree camera system with 3D imagery to help improve parking. The available Driver Assistance Package comes with an upgraded lane departure steering assist that Mercedes says operates more smoothly thanks in part to its active steering control.\nPricing and Release Date\nThe 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe is expected to make its way to dealerships later this year. Expect pricing information and fuel economy figures to be released closer to its on-sale date.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class: Still Small but Bigger on Tech, Safety\n2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA35 Promises High Performance at Entry Level\n2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 Review: Fancy but Flawed\n2020 Mercedes CLA45 Packs AMG Engine With Record Output\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
