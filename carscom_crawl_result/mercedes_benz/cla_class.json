      "expert_review": "The 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG has fast moves, slick styling and luxury in spades, but its hefty price tag and disappointing transmission keep it from being truly outstanding.\n\nMercedes-Benz has a hit on its hands with the new CLA-Class “coupe,” a subcompact four-door the company is using to attract new customers. But if the CLA250’s turbocharged four-cylinder just isn’t fast enough for you, there’s this: the CLA45 AMG, which has the most powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine you can buy anywhere, a sportier suspension, big wheels, bolstered seats and a much more menacing exhaust tone. Our own David Thomas found the regular CLA250 to be more style than substance, with a ride that bordered on harsh and a price that quickly escalated as you tick option boxes (read his review here). But how does the baby Benz compare to new arrivals in the subcompact luxury category: the just-revised BMW M235i and Audi A3? After driving all three, some updates to the CLA discussion are in order.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe transformation from classy front-wheel-drive CLA250 to fire-breathing CLA45 AMG is more than just mechanical. The car’s already-curvaceous styling received a shot of adrenalin, with a more expressive front end that includes the “twin blade” AMG family grille and cross-member in titanium gray. It also got bigger air inlets, with black winglets that are actually functional, and standard bi-xenon headlights. My test car came with optional 19-inch, black, 16-spoke alloy wheels on super-low-profile rubber that combined with the Cirrus White metallic paint and a red leather interior to make a fantastic-looking car. The stylish new CLA is grabbing attention and doing exactly what it needs to do for Mercedes-Benz — bringing a new, much-younger buyer into showrooms.\n\nHow It Drives\nPowering the CLA45 AMG is the most potent turbocharged four-cylinder engine in the world: a 355-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s mated to a standard seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels. The CLA45 uses all those horses to get from zero to 60 mph in about 4.5 seconds. Plant your foot at any time and the turbo spools up quickly, launching the car rapidly and providing a soundtrack rather unlike any you’ve heard from an AMG vehicle. It’s snorty and loud — almost as raucous as a Fiat 500 Abarth — but with a bit more precision in sound quality than that Italian job offers. It also overpowers its competition, besting the BMW M235i and its 320-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and far outgunning the new Audi S3 and its 290-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Bringing the car down from highway speeds is easy with the big, firm, fade-free brakes. Speed comes on strong once the vehicle is rolling, but from a standing start it doesn’t feel like 355 hp, due in part to a transmission that ruins the car’s low-speed driving experience.\n\nThe CLA45 has a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, similar in concept to the Porsche PDK and Volkswagen DSG but not as well-tuned as either of those units. It hesitates on launch from a standing start, making you push harder on the accelerator to get some motion going, only to suddenly catch up with you and propel you forward faster than you wanted to go. It’s not turbo lag, it’s the transmission tuning; the same thing happens in parking lots and in Reverse gear. Such problems are not present in Audi’s excellently tuned six-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic or BMW’s conventional eight-speed automatic; both work flawlessly.\n\nOnce underway, the CLA45’s brilliantly tuned chassis and suspension are extremely rewarding in terms of the feedback they provide, with amazing balance, handling and body control that would be immense fun on a track or canyon road. This car wants you to drive it fast, and you’ll want to drive it fast. The problematic transmission feel goes away as you bang off shifts using the paddle shifters or push the button to engage Sport mode, keeping the engine in a sweet spot for aggressive use. Ride quality is indeed quite stiff, but in a car that’s visibly meant to be a performance-oriented sport sedan, that’s more appropriate than it is on the base CLA. Yet the ponderous, hesitant, low-speed around-town-driving feel of the car makes me wish there were a manual transmission option. The transmission is really the only letdown in an otherwise enormously fun car, but it’s a big enough bummer that it overshadows a lot of the CLA45’s entertaining qualities.\n\nInterior\nOpen the driver’s door and one thing becomes apparent: This truly is a small car. The B-pillar is far forward, making sliding into the driver’s seat a little difficult — you don’t so much sit in the car as fall into it. Once inside, the narrow interior combines with the optional, heavily bolstered AMG sport seats to provide for a very tight fit, even for the skinniest of occupants. Add in the optional moonroof, which deletes 1.2 inches of headroom, and you start to see why Mercedes-Benz refers to this as a coupe — given its super-tidy dimensions, it would be more appropriate if it had just two doors. The BMW M235i doesn’t have much more room, but the Audi A3 certainly does — 8 inches more rear legroom. Outward visibility is a victim of the CLA’s style; having this rakish profile comes at the price of gun-slit side glass and a short rear window. The A3 and M235i feel positively airy and spacious by comparison, but neither looks as racy as the CLA.\n\nAt least the materials are top-notch, receiving a bit of an upgrade from the regular CLA250. They match the quality of the BMW and best the Audi. Mercedes says the standard seating material is “MB-Tex man-made leather with DINAMICA microfibers” (a fancy way of saying “vinyl”), but my test vehicle came equipped with optional perforated leather upholstery on Recaro performance seats in black and red with red stitching. There are also bright red seat belts, a chunky, multifunction, suedelike steering wheel and AMG-badged details like unique gauges, seats and shift knob. It all looks decidedly racier than the standard CLA250 and possesses far more style and flair than either the Audi or BMW.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMercedes-Benz’s latest version of the Mbrace2 multimedia system is standard on the CLA45, featuring a 5.8-inch display screen that either looks tacked onto the dashboard as an afterthought or artfully added as a styling element, depending on whom you ask. It works well, however, with easy-to-use menus that are a dramatic improvement over Benz systems of the past. The control knob for the system resides on the console between the front seats, easily within reach but requiring some additional, distracting hand-and-eye coordination to control the system that a touch-screen would not require. Another color display resides between the gauges, displaying functions controlled by the steering wheel buttons. One quirk on that steering wheel that’s common to Mercedes-Benzes: There’s a dedicated volume control, but no dedicated forward and back buttons for the audio system. If you want to advance a track from the steering wheel or cycle to another station, you first have to select the audio menu using additional buttons and cycle to the source — eliminating anything else you might have enjoyed looking at on your gauge screen, like the digital speedometer. This is a minor quibble, however, for a system that looks good, works well and sounds even better, thanks to the optional Harman Kardon premium audio system.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWhile the CLA45 isn’t a big car, it does provide a decent amount of trunk space, with 13.1 cubic feet at your disposal. This beats the Audi’s 12.3 cubic feet (10.0 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models) but is a hair smaller than the BMW’s 13.7 cubic feet. Like the Audi and BMW, the CLA45 features a split, folding backseat to extend the cargo area for longer items.\n\nSafety\nThe CLA has not yet been crash-tested, but it wouldn’t be a Mercedes-Benz if it didn’t come with optional electronic safety systems to boost the sticker price. Collision prevention assist and electronic attention monitors come standard, as does a special three-stage stability program that allows for progressive degrees of electronic nannying. Optional items like a backup camera, parking sensors, distance-keeping cruise control, blind spot warning and lane keep assist are mostly grouped into special option packages. See the CLA45’s full safety feature list here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe idea of the lesser CLA250 is that it starts around $30,000, but the fire-breathing CLA45 AMG begins more than a bit north of there: $48,375 including destination. That includes standard items like a 5.8-inch display screen and Mbrace2 multimedia system, power seats, automatic climate control, all-wheel drive, Attention Assist and rain-sensing wipers. Extra-cost options on my test car included the leather interior with AMG performance seats for $3,750; a Premium Package with iPod interface, dual-zone climate control, Harman Kardon sound system, heated seats and satellite radio for $2,300; the Comand multimedia system with navigation, backup camera, six-CD changer and an SD card slot for $2,370; Parktronic parking sensors for $970; the panoramic sunroof for $1,480; and 19-inch alloy wheels for $850. This pushed the grand total to $60,095 — a hefty sum for such a little car, even with its abilities and AMG exclusivity.\n\nThe luxury subcompact category has a couple other hot offerings, too, one of which is on sale already and one of which is not. The BMW M235i isn’t quite as fast as the CLA45 by the numbers, but it’s not as expensive, either — it starts at $44,025 including destination — but in typical BMW fashion even the most basic of creature comforts costs extra. It feels as fast as the CLA45, however, and with its rear-wheel drive, amazing balance, and beautifully smooth and torquey 320-hp inline-six-cylinder engine, it’s easily a match for the Benz. The Audi S3 had not yet arrived as of publication (it comes in late 2014) but comparisons with the A3 are not invalid. The A3 is more comfortable, more spacious and features a lot more standard equipment than the CLA, but the S3’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine doesn’t make nearly as much power or torque. Hopefully it will cost less. If what you’re looking for is all-wheel drive and a powerful, turbocharged four-cylinder, the Subaru Impreza WRX STI might be a better idea. While it’s not nearly as sophisticated in terms of its luxury amenities or electronics, its powertrain, suspension and driving dynamics can keep up with the CLA45 AMG for nearly $10,000 less. Compare all four cars here.\n\nThe 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a unique beast that will appeal to a limited audience with its combination of genuine style, dramatic performance and raucous exhaust that’s perfect for the “look at me” crowd. But just like its lesser CLA250 brother, be prepared to accept compromises for that style.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nStyle over substance. That’s usually a negative connotation, but for Mercedes-Benz’s latest foray into affordable luxury, it might be a saving grace.\n\nThe all-new 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA is a stylish car inside and out that will likely turn heads and open wallets.\n\nIt packs decent performance, surprisingly good gas mileage and even more astonishing rear legroom. However, it has flaws that can’t be overlooked, such as a rough ride and options that escalate the price quickly.\n\nI tested both the front-wheel-drive CLA250 and the significantly more powerful all-wheel-drive CLA45 AMG over hundreds of miles on rural roads, highways and downtown streets around our nation’s capital.\n\nThe CLA250 competes with a variety of premium cars like Buick’s Regal and Acura’s ILX as well as BMW’s smallest engine 3 Series, the 320i. You can compare all four here. The CLA45 AMG is wedged between less expensive mainstream models and more expensive high-performance variants from Audi and BMW.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWalk into a Mercedes-Benz dealership and you’d be hard-pressed to tell the entry-level C-Class from its more staid E-Class brethren. Place the CLA in the same showroom and there’s no doubt it is an entirely different vehicle.\n\nBut look at the numbers and the CLA, which many will think is the smallest sedan, actually compares to the C-Class across the board. The CLA is 1.5 inches longer than a C-Class sedan, yet the snub-nosed front, raked rear pillars and bulbous rear make it look smaller.\n\nIt also looks sexier. It’s lower to the ground than the C-Class, and the slivers that Mercedes calls windows help accentuate the coupelike design. They certainly don’t help with visibility. See the two models compared side-by-side.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe concept of a front-wheel-drive Mercedes likely riles purists, but after testing the CLA over hundreds of miles, I don’t think buyers in this segment will mind the drivetrain. All-wheel drive is optional on the CLA250 and will be available early next year; the front-drive model is on sale now. The CLA45 AMG comes only in all-wheel drive and will be on sale later this year.\n\nPowering the 250 is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 208 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque teamed with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. These are impressive numbers that not only outpace the C250’s power but also team with remarkable EPA estimates of 26 mpg city, 38 mpg highway and 30 mpg combined. Over a driving leg of 126 miles at significant speeds but with few stops and two adults onboard, the CLA250’s trip computer showed 31.7 mpg with an average speed of 42 mph.\n\nThe CLA250 base model is 164 pounds lighter than a C-Class; it feels nimbler, even when pressing hard through twisty turns where the front-wheel drive is probably least impressive.\n\nHammer the throttle down on the CLA250 from a standstill and there is significant tire spin from the front wheels, but in more typical acceleration, the CLA250 pulls confidently both from 30 mph and, for highway passing, from 60 mph.\n\nWhere the CLA-Class stands out most is in steering. Even the CLA250 provides precise response and a steering feel that isn’t heavy. There isn’t much assist apparent from the electric power steering either, allowing for a natural feel.\n\nThe CLA45 AMG sports the most powerful four-cylinder engine on the market. While it is an impressive performance machine in some ways, it sits in an unsure spot for enthusiast shoppers. It’s a step above most amped-up sports sedans on the market like the Audi S4, but it’s unclear whether it will hold off the next M3 or M4 from BMW. The price will still be lower for the CLA45 AMG, though.\n\nWith 355 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque coming from a seriously steroidal version of the same turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder as the base CLA250, the CLA45 AMG hustles from a stop, and any other speed, quickly, but it isn’t as exhilarating as I expected with those numbers. A variety of drive settings impact throttle response, and when in Sport mode the engine timing is altered to deliver a loud “burp” through the exhaust when shifting hard.\n\nIt’s a bizarre sound in some ways, but I found it pretty enjoyable. Otherwise, the exhaust sound is a bit rattly and always present — even in Comfort mode, though you don’t experience the burping when shifting. Mileage numbers haven’t been released yet, but over a 75-mile leg of aggressive testing, the trip computer read 25 mpg.\n\nLike the 250, the CLA45 AMG’s steering is a standout. Teamed with all-wheel drive, this is the blend of handling precision and livability anyone would appreciate. It hugged corners and gives an extreme sense of confidence when accelerating out of them.\n\nBraking is also impressive in both cars. The AMG slows more aggressively with its larger rotors, but even the 250 impressed. It saved me from damaging a brand-new car when a large truck decided to change lanes without signaling in tight traffic.\n\nBut shoppers will have to decide if the performance plusses outweigh the pretty significant minus: The CLA — with a wheelbase 2.4 inches shorter than the C-Class — has a pretty harsh ride in base and AMG forms. The AMG’s ride is extremely rough, with jolts coming through sharply over every road imperfection. It’s so severe that it reminded me of more aggressive alterations like Audi’s RS5 coupe. The AMG version replaces the standard suspension with gas-filled struts and front and rear stabilizer bars.\n\nThe CLA250 jolted me from driving enjoyment less frequently but with regularity whenever a moderate to extreme road defect came under wheel. Most of the roads I traveled were superbly maintained, but those that were more akin to my home turf of Chicago revealed unacceptable ride comfort.\n\nNo matter the vehicle and wheel and tire combination I tested, road noise was also extremely loud. Any surface that wasn’t smooth blacktop made its presence known.\n\nAnd then there’s the visibility. I haven’t tested any four-door vehicle with such limited sightlines. The CLA’s back window is slim, all four side windows are similarly short, the side mirrors are relatively small and the rear pillars are rather huge. The only car I’ve tested in the recent past with such poor visibility — that wasn’t a convertible — is the Chevrolet Camaro, and that’s a two-door sports car.\n\nThis means drivers need to be much more aware when changing lanes — cars can sneak up on you easily with such large blind spots on either side — and especially when backing out of a parking spot.\n\nInterior\nA $30,000 Mercedes’ interior quality and materials are going to be scrutinized to an extreme degree. To Mercedes’ credit, shoppers in this price range likely aren’t expecting much more. The wide swaths of textured black faux leather across the dash and doors were soft to the touch and had a sheen that resembled the real thing despite obviously being a synthetic material. The two dozen or so vehicles on hand were all equipped with black interiors; tan, gray and dark brown are also available. Even if you opt for leather seats, the dash material remains the same but adds some stitching for design flair.\n\nTo offset this cost savings, Mercedes did an artful job with the air vents. Yes, air vents. Five metallic-ringed circular vents break up the dash. Styled after the vents in the company’s halo SLS AMG supercar, they’re the stars of the interior. They work quite well with a quick flip of the interior cross-section to adjust air output, and they also swivel in all directions.\n\nAttractive — if almost impossible to read — analog gauges bracket a much more usable digital display that shows the driver trip data and other information, though to avoid breaking speed limits, I set it to display the speed digitally. I really couldn’t tell how fast I was going by looking at the analog option, especially with the sun casting harsh shadows.\n\nWhile the interior looks good for the money, the seats sure didn’t feel welcoming to my driving partner or me over our extended drive. After about 30 minutes in the seat, my back was aching. My partner complained about his lower extremity’s lack of appreciation for the seat bottom’s firmness.\n\nEven on the second day of driving, when I often get acclimated to a car’s seats, the CLA’s still were too firm for me.\n\nAll CLA seats have fixed head restraints, which is unusual these days but look good and didn’t impact comfort with the lack of adjustability. More shoppers will likely have issues with the seats’ side bolstering. Even on the CLA250, the bolsters encroached on my torso and thighs. I’d say I’m average in these dimensions; people who consider themselves slim or petite will likely have no issues with them. The AMG has optional Recaro-brand seats with even more aggressive bolstering.\n\nThe most shocking interior development is the rear seats. Just by looking at the raking roofline you expect the backseat to be completely unusable, but once you duck your head to get in — you will need to warn rear passengers before they try to enter — the backseat has enough legroom that I was comfortable with the front seat adjusted for my 5-foot-10-inch frame. I also had plenty of legroom in the front passenger seat in this setup. Your feet are raised a bit to rest against the engine wall versus the floor, so it has the feeling of being in a recliner despite the lack of a footrest.\n\nHeadroom in back is a bit tighter. With the optional moonroof, my hair was touching the roof. In a model without the moonroof, the CLA gains 1.4 inches of headroom. In this car my hair wasn’t touching the ceiling, but I doubt 6-footers will be as lucky.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe CLA250 is being heavily advertised with its $29,900 starting price — before a $925 destination charge — and with that there is a good level of standard equipment including a 5.8-inch display screen, Bluetooth, power driver and front passenger seats, and imitation-leather upholstery.\n\nHowever, it’s unlikely most shoppers will go for the stripped-down model with such feeble technology options.\n\nA $2,300 Premium Package is needed to add an iPod interface, upgraded Harman Kardon stereo, satellite radio and dual-zone climate control. However, the most modestly equipped CLA250 on hand also added the $2,370 Multimedia Package, which includes a much larger 7-inch display screen, navigation and a six-CD changer. This means the sub-$30,000 car I was testing would actually cost $34,595 out the door.\n\nThe larger navigation screen itself floats out from the dash almost like an aftermarket kit, but the actual result is much more elegant. The resolution is quite good, with maps as impressive as any on the market. During our test, each route was preprogrammed into the computer with waypoints, which was convenient. After an unplanned detour, the computer quickly rerouted me back to my hotel.\n\nVoice controls also worked well with no need to wait for a prompt or beep to give the next command. It would dial numbers and switch screens between phone and map interfaces with ease. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a compatible device to test out the iPod integration, as the connector is still set for previous-generation iPods; an adapter for the connector would be needed. The USB port charged my iPhone 5 but did not play music. Bluetooth audio streaming worked well. Two phones could be paired at once so that one could be used for phone, one for music, and it was easy to switch back and forth between them.\n\nThe Harman Kardon system had decent sound quality but very little low range for robust sound on rock ‘n’ roll and R&B tracks where you’d want more bass in the mix.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe CLA’s trunk is a respectable 13.1 cubic feet, with a large, wide under-floor storage area. The C-Class is rated at 12.4 cubic feet and the BMW 320i at 13.0 cubic feet, but in real-world use I don’t think the CLA is superior to either competitor. Luggage and golf clubs should be easily accommodated, but there isn’t a lot of height to the trunk so bulkier items will be an issue, and the standard folding rear seats likely won’t help there.\n\nSafety\nA new model, the CLA-Class hasn’t been crash-tested as of publication.\n\nThe CLA comes with a standard suite of airbags including knee airbags for both the driver and front passenger. A $2,500 Driver Assistance Package adds lane departure warning as well as lane keeping and collision prevention systems. The collision prevention system was equipped on a few of the models I tested and came into use once as intended. Amber and red lights illuminate along with a warning chime to alert drivers to an impending collision. It can apply 100 percent braking force to avoid a collision, but I didn’t notice braking besides my own in my testing.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHowever you shake it, no buyer is actually going to find a sub-$30,000 CLA. Mercedes predicts most CLA250s will be sold at roughly the $35,000 mark like the least expensive model I tested. A similarly equipped BMW 320i comes to $37,120, so the CLA still offers more for less, as they say, and has more power and better fuel economy than that most basic of 3 Series.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive setup will likely be irrelevant to a majority of shoppers, considering how striking this car is. The style, price and performance make the CLA a winner on paper; it’s just the comfort sacrifices found on the road you need to check off before signing any paperwork.\n\nThe much more expensive CLA45 AMG, starting at $49,300 including destination, is harder to justify, but when compared against pricey cars with their top engines — like Cadillac’s ATS — it becomes more intriguing.\n\nSend David an email",
