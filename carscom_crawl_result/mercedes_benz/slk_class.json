      "expert_review": "In the motoring media, the question keeps being asked: Is the new Mercedes-Benz SLK230 really a sports car?\n\nNo one disputes the fact that SLK is fun to drive and great to be seen in. The baby Benz complements Mercedes’ more expensive SL roadsters, and manages to combine the vibrant personality of a sports car with the stolid practicality of corporate Mercedes.\n\nIn doing so, the two-seater makes compromises – some good, some not so good.\n\nTo wit:\n\nSLK is both a coupe and a convertible. This is good. The hardtop provides a snug, quiet, weather-resistant cabin for two, eliminating the inevitable flapping, fading, tearing, vandalizing, etc., associated with cloth tops.\n\nIt folds away quickly, easily and completely, providing a true roadster experience. No one else has created a hardtop/convertible anywhere near as functional as this one. It’s a marvel of engineering, a ballet of moving parts that open, close and fold away with the touch of a button.\n\nLike most sports cars, the SLK looks better with its top down. When up, the top looks kind of ungainly and too small for the body. Top down, SLK looks sleek and aggressive.\n\nFor ’98, SLK comes only with an automatic transmission. This is bad. For an automatic, it works well enough, even downshifting electronically for braking and shifting manually, to a degree. But this type of car cries out for stick shift.\n\nIn Europe, one can buy most Mercedes cars with stick shift, but not here. The automaker says its market studies show U.S. drivers want automatic in Mercedes-Benz cars, so the decision was made not to offer stick shift in any of them, including SLK.\n\nThis was a big mistake, one that undoubtedly has caused prospective buyers to step into Porsche Boxsters and BMW Z3s instead of SLKs.\n\nAs a result, the automaker has changed its mind, and stick-shift SLKs will be making their way to our shores later this year.\n\nIn its interior styling, SLK seems unresolved in whether to be retro or postmodern. This is neither good nor bad, just interesting.\n\nThe styling, by and large, is strongly postmodern, with industrial-type styles and textures throughout the appealing design. But then, the gauges are vintage-looking, with parchment backgrounds and stylized type.\n\nThe gauges are attractive but seem out of tune with the overall theme.\n\nThe ride is relatively soft, for a sports car, but good suspension geometry and a well-engineered rear setup make the SLK plenty of fun to throw around curves. This is either good or bad, depending on your personal preferences.\n\nPersonally, I’d like a slightly stiffer ride to enhance the sports-car allure. But many drivers will appreciate the extra comfort and long-legged touring-car abilities, while still being able to handle crisply with poise and precision.\n\nThe suspension tuning is a compromise, and one that helps erode the vision of SLK as a bona fide sports car.\n\nWhatever you call it, the SLK is a sharp little automobile. It’ s like a wedge-shaped sample of Mercedes’ sports-car history, harking back to the 190SL of the 1950s, which was an affordable four-cylinder alternative to the mighty 300SL roadsters and gull-wing coupes.\n\nLike the 190, the SLK is powered by a four-banger. But this is now, and the SLK engine is a silky-smooth supercharged version with 185 horsepower that makes angry snarls while pulling like a bulldog. It is blunted, though, by the automatic transmission, which fails to take best advantage of the engine’s high-revving power.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine has been criticized as not being up to snuff for a $40,000, luxury-oriented automobile. But the supercharged four is quite satisfying, especially when it sends up a throaty howl during acceleration, and will be even more so once it has a stick shift backing it up.\n\nSLK has advanced safety features worth mentioning: four-wheel, independent anti-lock brakes; an upgraded type of traction control called automatic slip reduction; dual front and side air bags; and an automatic sensor that shuts off the passenger-side bag if a specially designed infant seat is used.\n\nAt $40,000, the SLK is certainly a luxury item, but Mercedes’ legendary durability makes the price seem right in there. At least for those who can afford such a fine toy.\n\nThere are only three options available on the SLK: heated seats, metallic paint and a choice of phone/CD player combinations. Our tester had the trick stereo.\n\nThe SLK comes to us as part of the Germanic trio of midrange sports cars, including Boxster and Z3. Then there’s the redesigned Chevrolet Corvette. All four of these cars are priced in the $40,000 range, and each of them brings something else to the table.\n\nCorvette has the power and flash, Boxster offers history and driving finesse, and Z3 upholds the tradition of classic sports cars.\n\nFor the SLK, it’s more like looking into the future. Overall refinement and unique, practical features make the SLK stand out in terms of real-world ownership, if not in performance or image.\n\n1998 Mercedes-Benz SLK230\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes gives its rear-drive SLK roadster a new V-6 engine and gets an early start on the 2001 model year with the addition of the SLK320 model. The new V-6 version joins the SLK230, powered by a supercharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe SLK230 arrived as a 1998 model and the first modern car with a retractable hardtop roof. With base prices of $38,900 for the SLK230 and $43,900 for the new SLK320, these roadsters are around half the price of Mercedes luxury roadster, the SL, which starts at $82,600.\n\nExterior\nThe 2001 models get several visual changes, including new front and rear aprons, sculpted rocker panels and body-color door handles. The V-6 SLK320 also has unique five-spoke wheels and a larger front air dam.\n\nOperation of the retractable steel hardtop is unchanged. Pushing a button on the console raises or lowers the articulating top in less than 25 seconds. It stores in the dual-hinged trunk, which opens at the front to accept the roof and at the rear to accept cargo.\n\nInterior\nLeather bucket seats are standard on both versions of the SLK, and metallic trim replaces carbon fiber dashboard trim on the four-cylinder model. The V-6 model also gets power seats, a telescoping steering column, wood interior accents and a leather/wood steering wheel as standard equipment.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe new 3.2-liter V-6 engine produces 215 horsepower, 25 hp more than the supercharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder. With either engine, the standard transmission is a six-speed manual, and the optional transmission is a five-speed automatic with Touch Shift, which allows changing gears manually by tipping the gear lever left or right.\n\nElectronic Stability Program (a skid-control system), traction control, antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard on both models.\n\nPerformance\nThe SLK230 is reasonably quick, but the engine is loud and coarse under full throttle  not what you expect on a $40,000 car from a luxury maker such as Mercedes. The new V-6 delivers a stronger punch and is quieter, more refined and more worthy of the brand.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "When Mercedes-Benz introduced the SLK a few years ago, many people were wondering when this neat little roadster would get a manual transmission.\n\nAfter all, sporty cars are about the only vehicles left that are still offered with a stick shift.\n\nMercedes brass said they had no plans to offer a stick shift in the SLK because so few drivers want to shift gears themselves these days. But, they said, they would listen to their customers and if enough people wanted the SLK with a manual gearbox, they’d make one.\n\nI just spent a week sporting around Orlando and its environs in an SLK with a five-speed manual gearbox. I’m glad Mercedes listened to its customers because the stick shift makes the SLK even more fun to drive.\n\nPerformance, handling\n\nThe SLK comes with a 185-horsepower, supercharged, four-cylinder engine. It’s an overhead cam motor with 16 valves. This little dynamo propels the 3,000 pound car to 60 mph in just 7.2 seconds. Pretty spunky.\n\nMercedes engineers tuned the engine to deliver strong performance at low speeds. Though not a road missile, the SLK moves away from a stop light smartly when you step on the gas. The supercharger — an engine-driven pump that stuffs more fuel and air into the engine — makes a lovely hum as it winds up.\n\nAnd you will rev this engine often. With one hand on the shifter and one on the wheel, you’ll be driving the SLK like you were on a race track. It’s too hard to drive it sedately.\n\nThe stubby little shifter notches easily into each gear. The clutch pedal is light and smooth, so you never get tired of shifting, even during rush hour. The gears are nicely spaced to take advantage of the engine’s power.\n\nThe four-wheel, independent suspension system — double wishbones up front and a multilink setup in the rear — keeps the power well under control. The ride is firm, but the car doesn’t beat you up when you drive over bumps. When cornering quickly, the sensation is very much like that of an amusement park ride. You are low to the ground and the car sticks to the pavement as if it were on rails.\n\nMercedes equips the SLK with power-assisted steering and power-assisted, four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes. The SLK’s braking system is one of the most advanced on the road. It can detect an emergency stop by the speed at which the brakes are applied. When you jam on the brakes, a computer takes over and applies full stopping power almost immediately. Mercedes calls the system Brake Assist. I couldn’t feel it working, but I can tell you that the SLK stops very quickly.\n\nFit and finish\n\nThe SLK’s retractable hardtop is a nifty item. There’s a red button shaped like the roof of the car planted on the console. Pull it back and the top will go down — as long as certain requirements are met. The top system is touchy. There’s a retractable cargo cover in the trunk. If it’s not in the right position, the top won’t work. The driver’s door has to be closed, or the top won’t work. I found out these things the hard way.\n\nOnce everything is in order, though , the top rises and lowers in less than 30 seconds. Unlike most convertibles, the SLK is as quiet as a coupe with the roof up. The windows seal tight, so there is no wind noise or water leaks.\n\nThe interior of the SLK is roomy and comfortable. There are map pockets in the doors and a few small compartments for sunglasses and things, but you won’t find any room for larger items, such as an umbrella or a briefcase. That’s the compromise you make with most sports cars.\n\nThe dash has a ’60s retro look to it. The gauges have ivory dials with red needles; they are wrapped in bright metal trim. The instruments look great and are easy to read. The seats are firm, but on a trip to Plant City and back, they proved comfortable.\n\nRotary controls operate the air conditioner. They are so simple to use that you don’t have to take your eyes off the road to make adjustments. One wish list item: It would be nice if the SLK came with automatic headlights.\n\nOur test car was outfitted with the $3,990 Sport package. I’d skip it and save the money. It adds spiffy aerodynamic bumpers, fog lamps and bigger wheels and tires. But the regular SLK doesn’t look much different, and it performs just as well.\n\nThough our test car was built well, it did have one annoying flaw: The clutch pedal had to be pressed all the way down hard or else the car wouldn’t start. There’s a switch on the pedal that prevents the car from being started while it is in gear. But it was out of adjustment.\n\nAfter testing the SLK for a week, I fell in love with it — again. It’s a wonderful car, a joy to drive and styled so well that it will still look classy years from now. So now I am tempted to take all of my spare money, rush over to the nearest convience store and load up on lottery tickets. If I’m not here next week, you’ll know why . . .\n\n1999 Mercedes-Benz SLK 230 Sport\n\nBase price: $40,000.

      "expert_review": "Ah, at last. Mercedes-Benz’s SLK roadster has finally arrived. This is my fourth turn in the wedgy little two-seater with the folding steel top. But this is the first one that I can say without reservation has the equipment and performance to qualify as a bona fide sports car. And all it took was an extra-fine V-6 and a slick-shifting, six-speed transmission.\n\nThe first three SLK models were not quite right. The first one I had back in ’98 seemed rushed into production to compete with the new flock of latter-day roadsters coming out of Germany and Japan.\n\nThat SLK 230 Kompressor contained a four-cylinder engine equipped with a supercharger (a.k.a. kompressor in German) and an automatic transmission. Performance was uninspiring, despite the 185 horses claimed for the engine, which also was harsh and lacking in low-end torque. And the automatic was just all wrong for a reputed sports car. Mercedes brass said that market studies showed Americans were not interested in shifting for themselves.\n\nWrong. Competing sports cars, from the retro-themed Mazda Miata to the desirable Porsche Boxster, were being sold mainly with manuals.\n\nMercedes, finding its SLK at the bottom of most drivers’ sports-car shopping lists, began offering SLKs with the option of a five-speed manual. But it was a balky unit that still blunted the experience. That was the second version I drove.\n\nThen came the third, an SLK 320 fitted with Mercedes’ sparkling 3.2-liter V-6, which also powers the fine E320 sedan. But once again, this test car came with automatic. Grrr.\n\nNow, I’ve had the SLK as it should have been in the first place, equipped with the smooth and powerful V-6 and a slick, close-ratio six-speed. SLK has soared in my opinion.\n\nThe engine and tranny were new for 2001 and carry over for 2002. So does the fine handling and responsive steering of the diminutive fliptop. The brakes are amazing. The six-speed is superb, with precisely chosen gear ratios that allow the driver to wring out optimum performance or to cruise quietly on the freeway in six-gear overdrive.\n\nThe firm suspension, which comes equipped with Mercedes’ Electronic Stability System that helps control skids in case you get too sporty, permits flat cornering and good road feel without being too hard on the occupants.\n\nThere is some tire thump over rough surfaces and sharp raps from such things as freeway expansion joints, but it’s never akin to the buckboard rides of vintage sports cars.\n\nLike all Mercedes cars, the body structure feels solid and well built. Standard equipment includes anti-lock brakes and side-impact airbags.\n\nThe retractable steel roof remains SLK’s signature element and a feature that strongly boosts its appeal. The folding top eliminates the security and maintenance hassles of cloth while allowing a full-fledged convertible experience. And with the top up, the cabin is as snug and secure as any coupe’s. Plus, it draws admiring crowds whenever it’s retracted or deployed.\n\nSLK is no longer alone with this feature, with Lexus following Mercedes (as it often does) with a retractable roof for its new SC430 sports car. And the newly unveiled SL roadster, SLK’s big brother in the Benz lineup, loses its fabric roof in favor of a retractable hardtop.\n\nTop up, the SLK is indeed cozy. Maybe a little too cozy, even claustrophobic. There’s enough legroom and headroom, but the two passengers will find there’s little room in here for anything else. Ditto for the trunk. Actually, the trunk has a decent amount of space with the top up, but that roof structure has to go somewhere. With the top down, trunk space shrinks from 12 cubic feet to just 5.\n\nCompared with the rest of the sports-car run, SLK is a pricey number. Certainly, Mercedes’ strong reputation for quality is a major selling point. But the $45,790 price tag of th est car, although well equipped, did give me pause. Add the desirable AMG performance package, and the SLK quickly soars past $50,000. The SLK 230 Kompressor is about $5,000 less than the SLK 320.\n\nStill, SLK has a unique personality, and with its performance gear straightened out, it can now run with the big dogs.",

      "expert_review": "The 2007 SLK 350 Roadster sells slowly in comparison with its Mercedes-Benz siblings. That’s understandable. It’s expensive and frightfully impractical. It accommodates two people, but not much of their stuff. Long-distance drives in this little car will leave you and your passenger stiff and grumpy. If you started out as spouses, best friends or lovers, there’s a good chance you might not remain that way by the end of your journey in the roadster.\n\nBut on a beautiful spring day when nature and love are in bloom, the SLK 350 is a motorized aphrodisiac. It’s stunningly attractive, especially with the convertible hardtop down. It’s fast. It’s sexy.\n\nSlip a Sergio Mendes disc into the CD player. Push back the electronic lever that controls the hardtop. Crank the volume . . . modestly. Find a curvy road.\n\nAlone, or with company, the SLK 350 is a marvelous car to drive as long as you don’t ask it to do what it was not designed to do comfortably — take you round-trip 300 miles in one day. The power-adjustable seats are the main problem.\n\nThere isn’t much space inside the SLK 350’s cabin. That means if you are accustomed to leaning back a bit as you caress the steering wheel, forget it. The driver’s seat, for example, keeps your body upright, whether you want to be upright or not. (I felt like I was back in seventh grade at Holy Redeemer Elementary School in New Orleans facing Sister Vincent, her little round spanking rod and her stern admonitions to “Sit up, Warren!”) I could take that punishment for 50 miles or so in the SLK 350. In fact, on short trips, being in this rear-wheel-drive runner does not feel like punishment at all. It’s downright fun! The six-speed manual shifter fits nicely in hand. The shift throws are short, precise — absolutely no hunting or fumbling around for the right gear. The car is wonderfully responsive to the driver’s directions.\n\nBut much of that driving glory fades when reality intrudes, such as getting stuck in traffic jams on narrow roads in Fairfax County. Your shift arm gets tired of shifting. Sitting upright becomes a day with Sister Vincent: “Straighten up! Lift that head! Both hands on your desk!\n\n“Stop that fidgeting!”\n\nIn the SLK 350, I was trying, but I could not comply. I wanted to get out. I was so happy when I turned into my driveway in Arlington I vowed never to leave it again — at least not in the SLK 350.\n\nMy assistant, Ria Manglapus, had a different experience. She’s short. She’s small. The cramped, but elegant SLK 350 cabin and its sit-up-straight driver’s seat did not bother her. “This is a fun car,” she said. “I love it!”\n\nOf course, she did. She’s a mother of two boys. She’s accustomed to carting them, their many cousins, their many friends and all of their stuff around in her 2003 Honda Odyssey minivan.\n\nBy comparison, the delightfully selfish, you’ve-earned-this, you-deserve-this SLK 350 was a dream. It made Ria feel so good, she scheduled a haircut during the two days she had the car. But reality cut short her roadster fun, too. “Gotta take the boys to school, and this won’t work,” she said upon returning the SLK 350.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point: It’s not supposed to do taxi work. The SLK 350 is a toy, an escape from hauling the world’s daily cares. It is the essence of luxury — splendidly extravagant, totally unnecessary and good for nothing much except bringing a smile to your face as you round a curve or take a corner in complete confidence.\n\nThat it lacks long-trip comfort is a plebeian complaint, the kind of bah-humbug mumbled by people like me, who often can afford only one vehicle to handle all transportation duties — hauling five or more passengers and their stuff comfortably on trips of all durations.\n\nTo the SLK 350, that is base work. The car’s sole existence for being is to provide intense moments of sheer driving pleasure. That’s “moments,” not hours or long days. The patricians who can afford the SLK 350 understand that. If they must travel 300 miles or so, they’d hire a limousine, or hop the first-class coach of a train or jet.\n\nAnd so, for all of you to whom such class distinctions are important, here is how you can tell a driver who can afford the SLK 350 versus the one who has borrowed it, or is struggling to make the car payments: The poseur drives the SLK 350 everywhere all the time, treating it like a commuter, which it really isn’t.\n\nNuts & Bolts 2007 Mercedes-Benz SLK 350\n\nComplaints: It’s expensive, impractical and designed to stay that way.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Acceleration and handling are top-notch. The electronic stability-control system in the SLK 350 is one of the best available — constantly monitoring steering inputs and quickly acting to correct errors, such as turning too quickly into a curve. Ride is excellent for trips of 50 miles or so on relatively clear roads. But with its cramped cabin and up-righteous seats, trips of longer durations, especially in heavy traffic, can become a chore.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Deliberately hot, sexy, sporty. It turns heads everywhere.\n\nBody style/layout: The SLK 350 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive luxury roadster with a power-operated, convertible hardtop roof. It has two side doors, two seats, no cabin space for cargo and a teeny trunk that can handle two small overnight bags. SLK models include the tested 350, the base 280 and the top-of-the-line SLK 55 AMG.\n\nEngine/transmission: Standard equipment includes a 3.5-liter, 24-valve, V-6 engine that develops 268 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 258 foot-pounds of torque at 2,400 rpm. The engine is linked to a six-speed manual transmission. A seven-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually is optional . . . for $1,430.\n\nCapacities: There are two seats. Cargo capacity is 9.8 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of required premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: We had a city/highway mileage of 20 miles per gallon.\n\nSafety: Antilock brakes, electronic stability and traction control, and side air bags are standard.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2007 Mercedes-Benz SLK 350 Roadster with manual transmission is $47,400. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $44,082. Price as tested is $57,620, including $9,445 in options (key fob that can operate doors, convertible hardtop and windows; premium audio system; Mercedes-Benz Tele Aid emergency communications system; onboard navigation; Sirius Satellite Radio, among many other spiffs) and a $775 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $53,640. Prices sourced from Mercedes-Benz and http://www.edmunds.com.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a great toy. Compare with BMW Z4, Nissan 350Z, Porsche Boxster.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMoving into its second generation for the 2005 model year, the Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class roadster retained its retractable hardtop but adopted a different front end with a large three-pointed star in the center and small grilles on each side. Inspired by Silver Arrow Formula One racecars, the 2005 SLK-Class was meant to resemble the automaker’s new SLR McLaren supercar. Mercedes claimed that this generation of the SLK-Class was “more aggressive, sportier and more powerful” than its 1998 – 2004 predecessor.\n\nThe SLK350 holds a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that drives a six-speed-manual gearbox or an optional seven-speed-automatic transmission with Touch Shift operation. This engine benefits from variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust valves.\n\nA new SLK280 version with a 228-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 is available for the 2006 model year. Mercedes-Benz also offers an SLK55 AMG edition with V-8 power.\n\nExterior\nThe roadster’s fascia features an arrow-shaped nose and a long hood. Measuring nearly 3 inches longer and wider than its predecessor, the latest SLK-Class has a steeply sloped windshield and taut body lines.\n\nThe SLK’s retractable hardtop goes up or down in 22 seconds. The folded roof takes up less trunk space than in the first-generation SLK.\n\nA lowered sport suspension is available. Ten-spoke alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires. Perforated and ventilated 13-inch front disc brakes have four-piston calipers. With its top down, the SLK-Class has 46 percent better torsional rigidity than its predecessor.\n\nInterior\nRedesigned for 2005, the roadster’s interior features silver-colored switches and trim elements. The sculpted dashboard blends into the door panels on each side. Large chronometer-style gauges dominate the two-passenger cockpit. Trunk space is 6.5 cubic feet with the top down and 9.8 cubic feet with the top up.\n\nFor cool-weather driving with the top down, an optional Airscarf neck-level heating system blows warm air from the headrests.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn the initial SLK350 model, a 3.5-liter V-6 with variable timing for both intake and exhaust valves develops 268 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque. Either a six-speed-manual gearbox or a seven-speed automatic with Touch Shift operation can be installed. A 355-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 powers the SLK55 AMG. For 2006, the new SLK280 roadster contains a 228-hp, 3.0-liter twin-cam V-6.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an Electronic Stability Program are standard. A BabySmart child-recognition system prevents the front passenger-side airbag from activating.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcceleration is energetic and refined with the 3.5-liter engine, which seems a more civilized choice than the old supercharged four-cylinder. Automatic-transmission operation can be rude. It can get jerky at low speeds in lower gears and delivers a sizable jolt if you hit the gas pedal while slowing down.\n\nSteering and handling are strong points, inspiring confidence and poised behavior. Better yet, the SLK’s ride is easily tolerable for a sports car of this caliber. Sure you feel the bumps, but most are dispensed with rather handily.\n\nThe seats are adeptly supportive and snugly bolstered, yet surprisingly comfortable. Space is ample inside, and top-up visibility isn’t bad. When parking, however, the driver may have no clue where the pointy front end is located. Wide doors make parking-lot spots a problem.",

      "expert_review": "If you haven’t been in the market for a convertible in a while, you might be surprised to learn how many retractable-hardtop convertibles are available. Mercedes-Benz’s SLK-Class was at the forefront of this trend when it debuted for the 1998 model year. It’s gone through one complete redesign since then, and for 2009 it receives modest styling changes inside and out — and a more powerful 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the SLK350, which I tested. Also available with new styling are the SLK300 with a 3.0-liter V-6 and the SLK55 AMG with a 5.4-liter V-8.\n\nThere are a number of things to like about the SLK350, including its comfortable ride, strong powertrain and svelte looks. Unfortunately, there are just as many things that detract from its appeal, like frustrating power seats and a cabin that isn’t luxurious enough for the price this roadster commands.\n\nStyling\nThe SLK350 makes an interesting visual statement. The car has a bulge running down the middle of the hood that recalls the SLR McLaren, Mercedes’ supercar, and the large three-pointed star draws your attention to the grille. Exterior changes for 2009 include a split lower bumper that calls to mind the front wing of a Formula One racecar. Smooth bodyside styling continues around to the short rear deck, and the bottom of the rear bumper gains some strakes (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nConvertibles seldom have trouble looking good with the top down; that’s what they’re designed to do. What’s more telling is how they look when the top is up. The SLK350 has an advantage over its soft-top brethren because of its retractable hardtop, which gives designers more control over the shape of the roof. The SLK350’s metal roof seamlessly blends with the rest of the car’s design, as opposed to just being something to cover the cabin when the weather is bad. Overall, Mercedes has given the car an appropriately luxurious look that takes key elements from other, more expensive Mercedes-Benz models, like the SLR and SL550, which gives the SLK350 quite a bit of cachet for its class.\n\nRide & Handling\nFor a convertible that looks like it’s a dedicated sports car, the SLK350 proves to be a decent touring car when you get behind the wheel. Its four-wheel independent suspension yields a compliant ride even on rough roads, so you don’t have to worry about this car punishing you on the commute to work if that’s how you’ll be driving it sometimes.\n\nThe experience is equally agreeable on the highway, though a concrete section I drove on made the chassis oscillate up and down. A little bit of wind noise can penetrate the cabin on the highway with the top up, but it’s otherwise quiet in there.\n\nProbably the biggest impediment to long-haul comfort is the roadster’s firm bucket seats, which began to get uncomfortable after only three hours at the wheel. The seats have substantial side bolsters that’ll keep you in place when cornering quickly, but they could use softer padding.\n\nThe SLK-Class has a new variable-ratio power-steering system for 2009 that delivers quicker than normal turn-in, but beyond being precise and easy to steer, the SLK350 doesn’t engage you the way BMW’s 335i retractable-hardtop convertible can.\n\nPerformance\nThe SLK350’s 300-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and seven-speed automatic transmission make a nice pair, with the V-6 providing plenty of power and the automatic executing smooth shifts that can’t be felt most of the time. It’s also rather thrifty; during a trip from Chicago to Elkhart Lake, Wis. — about 150 miles of mostly highway driving — the SLK350 averaged 29 mpg. Official EPA estimates for this drivetrain are 18/26 mpg city/highway.\n\nCabin Constraints\nThe SLK350’s cabin is definitely cozy if you’re around 6 feet tall, and the car’s optional power seats don’t help matters. If you’re tall, you’ll find that the seats work against you in your quest to get comfortable in the car. If you move them back to increase legroom, the backrest automatically moves forward incrementally so it doesn’t get mashed against the rear wall of the cabin. Now, I can understand Mercedes’ concern for its seats, but shouldn’t driver comfort come first? Even though I was able to get relatively comfortable, I was never able to put the seat exactly where I wanted.\n\nChanges to the cabin for 2009 are relatively minor and could easily go unnoticed. The audio system has been revamped and now includes a screen like the one used on models with the automaker’s Comand system. It doesn’t, however, include the integrated control knob you’ll find in a C-Class or S-Class sedan with Comand; selections are made using a set of buttons on the dash. The steering wheel is also new and the gauges have been mildly restyled.\n\nDespite the changes, the cabin is rather plain and basic when you consider the SLK350 starts at about $50,000. Some of the buttons and controls in the cabin, like the ones for the retractable hardtop and side mirrors that are located on the center console, have a low-grade look and feel.\n\nSafety\nThe SLK350 hasn’t been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but standard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, knee airbags and an electronic stability system.\n\nSLK350 in the Market\nIf you have $50,000 or more to drop on a convertible, life is obviously pretty good, and there’s no shortage of models in that price range from which to choose. If a retractable-hardtop is what you want, the 335i is a very good one that’s priced nearly identical to the SLK350 and comes with a backseat. Among roadsters, this price is also in the territory of the BMW Z4 and Porsche’s Boxster. If you’re willing to spend a little more, there are V-8-powered models like the Audi S4 Cabriolet and Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nThe SLK350 can clearly hold its own against these models in the styling department thanks to its athletic shape, top up or down, but the cabin design doesn’t make the same visual statement as the exterior, and some might find themselves wishing for more comfortable quarters. If that’s the case, your BMW dealer may hold the cure on his lot.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLittle has changed for 2003 on Mercedes-Benzs lower-priced, two-seat, retractable-hardtop convertible. A new, high-performance SLK32 AMG version emerged for the 2002 model year and is equipped with a 349-horsepower supercharged V-6 engine, racing-derived brakes and an AMG SpeedShift transmission. Only 1,000 models were destined for the U.S. market. A new Sport Package that is inspired by the SLK32 AMG is available for the regular SLK-Class models and includes a fresh front air dam, rocker panels and a rear valance.\n\nFace-lifted for 2001, the SLK320 has a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 engine, while the original SLK230 Kompressor uses a supercharged four-cylinder that makes 192 hp. Each model has Mercedes-Benzs Electronic Stability Program.\n\nExterior\nEquipped with sculpted rocker panels, Mercedes-Benzs smallest model in the United States sits on a 94.5-inch wheelbase that is 5 inches longer than the Mazda MX-5 Miatas. Push a button on the console and the articulating metal roof raises or retracts automatically into the dual-hinged trunk space in about 25 seconds. The trunk opens in two different modes: at the front to accept the roof or at the rear to fit a small amount of luggage. Door mirrors feature integrated turn-signal flashers.\n\nThe SLK32 AMG gets a special, recalibrated, reinforced suspension with unique spring rates and shock-absorber valving. Double-spoke, 17-inch alloy wheels on the SLK32 AMG hold P225/45ZR17 tires up front and P245/40ZR17 tires in the rear. A front air dam incorporates AMG fog lights, while a small lip spoiler at the rear of the trunk lid reduces aerodynamic lift by more than 50 percent, according to the manufacturer.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants get leather bucket seats. Standard equipment includes dual-zone air conditioning, an air filter, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a Bose cassette stereo system. In addition to the V-6 engine and wood interior trim, the SLK320 has eight-way power seats and a telescoping steering wheel. Maximum cargo space is 9.5 cubic feet but is only 3.9 cubic feet with the top down.\n\nSport seats in the SLK32 AMG are upholstered in two-tone Nappa leather and come equipped with integrated headrests and what Mercedes-Benz calls substantial side bolsters. Two-tone leather trim throughout the interior mates with dark birds-eye maple wood. Mercedes-Benzs Tele Aid emergency assistance system includes such functions as vehicle diagnostics, remote door unlocking and alarm monitoring.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe hottest engine of the SLK-Class is the supercharged Kompressor V-6 in the SLK32 AMG, which whips out 349 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. The SpeedShift transmission in the SLK32 AMG promises shifts that are up to 35 percent faster than those in a conventional automatic. Mercedes-Benz claims the SLK32 AMG can race from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds.\n\nThe supercharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine in the SLK230 Kompressor roadster is rated at 192 hp. Moving up to the SLK320 brings a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6. Both engines can team with the standard six-speed-manual transmission or with an optional five-speed-automatic unit that incorporates Touch Shift for manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard in all models. A BabySmart child-recognition system keeps the front-passenger airbag from activating.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nPosted on 3/26/03",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Mercedes SLK looks sharper than ever, with driving and luxury to match.\n\nSince the Mercedes-Benz SLK made its debut, its styling has been writing checks the rest of the car couldn’t cash. The 2012 redesign has improved the SLK in many respects. Driving enthusiasts will still lean toward a BMW Z4 or Porsche Boxster, which outperform the SLK at the extremes, but the gap is closing.\n\nThe V-6-powered SLK350 comes standard with a seven-speed automatic. Starting in February, Mercedes will offer an SLK250, with a turbocharged four-cylinder running through the automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. February will also mark the debut of a V-8 SLK55 AMG, which comes only with the automatic. All three cars have rear-wheel drive and a standard power-retractable hardtop. We evaluated an SLK350; click here to compare it with last year’s SLK.\n\nGetting Around\nThe SLK350’s 302-horsepower V-6 feels burlier than its 3.5-liter displacement suggests, but it’s best driven in the automatic transmission’s Sport mode. The alternative — Eco mode — makes for recalcitrant downshifts and tepid acceleration off the line — a recurring complaint I have in Mercedes vehicles. (Alas, there’s no mode between Eco and Sport.) Sport mode doesn’t eliminate accelerator lag, but it makes start-offs responsive enough and highway kickdown improves a great deal.\n\nDriven hard in Sport, the SLK350 moves out well, kicking down three or four gears at once to barrel up to speed. Curiously, the transmission’s steering-wheel paddle shifters effect a slower response: Request a few downshifts and the gearbox ticks through the intermediary gears en route to what you want. It’s best to leave the SLK in Sport mode, mash the pedal and let the gearbox do its thing.\n\nMercedes says the SLK350 hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, while the 201-hp SLK250 takes 6.5 seconds. That’s snappy enough, to be sure, but pokier than the Porsche Boxster, Audi TT and BMW Z4 with comparable drivetrains. If you prefer to smoke two out of three, the SLK55 AMG’s 415-hp V-8 hits 60 mph in 4.5 seconds — quicker than all but the newest version of Audi’s coupe, the TT RS.\n\nThe SLK steers confidently, with good midcorner feedback, albeit less precision than the laser-like Boxster. The Mercedes holds course well enough, though, allowing controlled slides if you deactivate the electronic stability system. Ride quality improves, too: Our tester’s suspension filtered out small bumps with none of its predecessor’s floaty jitters. Typical of a hardtop convertible, top-up driving is as quiet as you’d get in a coupe. Major bumps disrupt the peace, prompting one editor to denounce the SLK’s ride altogether. The optional adaptive suspension might fare better, but our test car didn’t have it. Note, too, that the SLK55’s steering and suspension have unique, higher-performance tuning.\n\nOutside & In\nWider and longer than its predecessor, the new SLK takes cues from Mercedes’ SLS AMG supercar. The lower taillights might not be for everyone, but the roadster’s nose should find few detractors. Mercedes says inspiration for the forward, upright grille comes from the 1955-63 190SL, much like the SLS’ relation to the gull-winged 300 SL. I approve.\n\nThe SLK250 has 17-inch alloy wheels, while the SLK350 has 18s. The SLK55 has wider 18s, among other additions: LED running lights, reworked ground effects and darker lights. All trims have a power-folding hardtop, but it crawls: It takes 30 seconds to operate, including putting the windows back up.\n\nA solid metal roof is standard. Mercedes’ optional Magic Sky Control replaces it with a glass panel, which you can vary from clear to opaque with the touch of a button. For less money, the automaker offers fixed-tint glass, which our test car had. Take note: There’s no sun shade, and in direct sunlight the tint doesn’t stop the cabin from baking.\n\nCabin materials have improved, with genuine aluminum trim, hefty controls and more consistent paneling than last year’s SLK. Two navigation systems have screens measuring 5.8 and 7 inches. Our test car had the latter; it’s a more robust system that couples with Mercedes’ intuitive Comand knob-based control system.\n\nThe seats, unfortunately, remain too stiff, with little payoff on curvy roads. Get the SLK in a tight sweeper, and your backside still slides too much. Power adjustments are standard, but tall drivers will want more range. At 5-foot-11, I drove with the chair all the way back.\n\nTrunk volume is 10.1 cubic feet, falling to 6.4 cubic feet with the convertible top lowered. Both figures compare to the Z4, but that illustrates a drawback of folding hardtops. The soft-top TT and Boxster don’t encroach on luggage room when you lower the roof.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe SLK hasn’t been crash-tested, and given its limited sales volume it probably won’t be. Standard features include eight airbags and the federally required antilock brakes and electronic stability system; click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nStandard features on the SLK350 include power-adjustable leather seats, the automatic transmission, a power-folding hardtop, Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming, and a CD stereo with USB/iPod connectivity. Options include upgraded leather, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats, two navigation systems, two glass roofs (one of them variable tint) and adaptive xenon headlights. Check all the factory options, and the SLK350 tops out near $70,000.\n\nAs of this writing, Mercedes has yet to spec and price the SLK250 and SLK55. Expect them to bookend the SLK350’s price, with fewer standard features in the SLK250 and more in the SLK55.\n\nSLK in the Market\nShort of perhaps the SLK55, the SLK still shies away from hard-core performance — something the Boxster embraces and the Z4 hits on well enough. But the Mercedes comes closer to the mark than it used to, and it doesn’t sacrifice too much along the way. Styling and cabin quality alone should sell the car. Its chief aggravation — accelerator lag — is endemic to Mercedes overall, and it hasn’t stymied the brand’s sales uptick so far. The new SLK is far from perfect, but it’s the best one yet.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned last year, Mercedes’ third-generation SLK roadster continues to offer a folding metal hardtop, but there’s also the option of Mercedes’ Magic Sky Control, a glass roof panel with variable transparency The SLK is available in three trims: the turbo four-cylinder SLK250 that can be had with a manual transmission, the 302-horsepower V-6 SLK350 and the high-performance SLK55 AMG powered by a big 5.5-liter V-8. Competitors to both cars include the Audi TT, BMW Z4 and Porsche Boxster.\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, all SLK models now come equipped with mbrace2 in-car technology and optional Adaptive Highbeam Assist. SLK350 models now come standard with features including heated seats, iPod/MP3 interface, remote-operated hardtop, Airscarf neck-heating system and a premium stereo with satellite radio. Fuel-saving Eco Start/Stop is also now standard on the 3.5-liter V-6.\n\n(Skip to details on the: SLK55 AMG)\nExterior\nThe SLK is  one of the shorter cars in its class. Like on the SLS-Class supercar, the SLK’s grille sits low and well ahead of the headlights; a single chrome band divides it, with Mercedes’ three-pointed star sitting front and center. Like many new luxury cars, the SLK uses LEDs in its taillights and daytime running lights. All SLKs feature a standard power-retracting hardtop with optional Magic Sky Control, a glass pane that can be electronically switched to be transparent or opaque. Other exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch wheels standard; 18-inch wheels optional\nStandard power-retracting hardtop\nOptional sport appearance package \nOptional adaptive bi-xenon headlights with washers\nOptional keyless access system\nAvailable rear spoiler\n\nInterior\nA more shelf-like dashboard dominates the new SLK’s two-seat interior; Mercedes says it used horizontal shapes to emphasize the car’s width. A standard 5.8-inch center screen houses the stereo and optional navigation displays. The automaker says the SLK’s glove compartment is 26 percent larger than its predecessor. Trunk volume measures 10.1 cubic feet with the folding hardtop raised and 6.4 cubic feet with it lowered. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable Harman Kardon premium stereo\nStandard aluminum trim; optional wood trim\nStandard flat-bottom, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls\nOptional wood-and-leather steering wheel\nAvailable leather seats; heated seats optional\nOptional neck-level heating vents embedded in seatbacks\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe SLK250 uses a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, while the SLK350 has a 3.5-liter V-6. Mercedes says the SLK250 accelerates to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, while the SLK350 takes 5.4 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nTurbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder with 201 hp and 229 pounds-feet of torque (SLK250)\n3.5-liter V-6 with 302 hp and 273 pounds-feet of torque (SLK350)\nSLK250 comes with a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic; SLK350 comes only with the automatic\nSLK350 has standard Eco Start/Stop fuel-saving technology\n\nSafety\nAll SLKs come with eight airbags, including head-extending side airbags that deploy from the doors. Additional safety features include:\n\n\nAvailable parking assist\nElectronic stability control with traction control\nMbrace2 in-car telematics\nAttention assist\nAdaptive high-beam assist\n\nSLK55 AMG\nThe high-performance 2013 SLK55 AMG features the only V-8 powertrain offered on the roadster. The AMG model pairs with a seven-speed AMG automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddles. Like the four-cylinder and six-cylinder, which feature new fuel economy measures, the new V-8 is also more fuel efficient and more powerful than its predecessor.\n\nThe 5.5-liter V-8 gains fuel efficiency by implementing stop/start technology and cylinder deactivation and by using more lightweight aluminum in the casting of the powertrain.\n\nBesides the V-8 powertrain, the AMG model distinguishes itself from the regular trims through AMG-specific aesthetic upgrades: light-alloy wheels, a large front air dam, ground effects kit, a spoiler lip and chrome-plated twin tailpipes. The SLK55 AMG also features an optional AMG Handling Package that has a limited-slip differential, performance suspension and steering wheel, and package-specific 18-inch AMG wheels in either silver or matte black.\n\nOn the inside, the SLK55 AMG gets a center-console analog clock, aluminum trim and pedals, AMG-specific steering wheel, unique instrument cluster and sport bucket seats. The SLK55 also features a standard hardtop retractable roof with a full glass pane that can be electronically switched to be transparent or opaque. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2008 about the 2009 Mercedes-Benz SLK. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf you haven’t been in the market for a convertible in a while, you might be surprised to learn how many retractable-hardtop convertibles are available. Mercedes-Benz’s SLK-Class was at the forefront of this trend when it debuted for the 1998 model year. It’s gone through one complete redesign since then, and for 2009 it receives modest styling changes inside and out — and a more powerful 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the SLK350, which I tested. Also available with new styling are the SLK300 with a 3.0-liter V-6 and the SLK55 AMG with a 5.4-liter V-8.\n\nThere are a number of things to like about the SLK350, including its comfortable ride, strong powertrain and svelte looks. Unfortunately, there are just as many things that detract from its appeal, like frustrating power seats and a cabin that isn’t luxurious enough for the price this roadster commands.\n\nStyling\nThe SLK350 makes an interesting visual statement. The car has a bulge running down the middle of the hood that recalls the SLR McLaren, Mercedes’ supercar, and the large three-pointed star draws your attention to the grille. Exterior changes for 2009 include a split lower bumper that calls to mind the front wing of a Formula One racecar. Smooth bodyside styling continues around to the short rear deck, and the bottom of the rear bumper gains some strakes (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nConvertibles seldom have trouble looking good with the top down; that’s what they’re designed to do. What’s more telling is how they look when the top is up. The SLK350 has an advantage over its soft-top brethren because of its retractable hardtop, which gives designers more control over the shape of the roof. The SLK350’s metal roof seamlessly blends with the rest of the car’s design, as opposed to just being something to cover the cabin when the weather is bad. Overall, Mercedes has given the car an appropriately luxurious look that takes key elements from other, more expensive Mercedes-Benz models, like the SLR and SL550, which gives the SLK350 quite a bit of cachet for its class.\n\nRide & Handling\nFor a convertible that looks like it’s a dedicated sports car, the SLK350 proves to be a decent touring car when you get behind the wheel. Its four-wheel independent suspension yields a compliant ride even on rough roads, so you don’t have to worry about this car punishing you on the commute to work if that’s how you’ll be driving it sometimes.\n\nThe experience is equally agreeable on the highway, though a concrete section I drove on made the chassis oscillate up and down. A little bit of wind noise can penetrate the cabin on the highway with the top up, but it’s otherwise quiet in there.\n\nProbably the biggest impediment to long-haul comfort is the roadster’s firm bucket seats, which began to get uncomfortable after only three hours at the wheel. The seats have substantial side bolsters that’ll keep you in place when cornering quickly, but they could use softer padding.\n\nThe SLK-Class has a new variable-ratio power-steering system for 2009 that delivers quicker than normal turn-in, but beyond being precise and easy to steer, the SLK350 doesn’t engage you the way BMW’s 335i retractable-hardtop convertible can.\n\nPerformance\nThe SLK350’s 300-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and seven-speed automatic transmission make a nice pair, with the V-6 providing plenty of power and the automatic executing smooth shifts that can’t be felt most of the time. It’s also rather thrifty; during a trip from Chicago to Elkhart Lake, Wis. — about 150 miles of mostly highway driving — the SLK350 averaged 29 mpg. Official EPA estimates for this drivetrain are 18/26 mpg city/highway.\n\nCabin Constraints\nThe SLK350’s cabin is definitely cozy if you’re around 6 feet tall, and the car’s optional power seats don’t help matters. If you’re tall, you’ll find that the seats work against you in your quest to get comfortable in the car. If you move them back to increase legroom, the backrest automatically moves forward incrementally so it doesn’t get mashed against the rear wall of the cabin. Now, I can understand Mercedes’ concern for its seats, but shouldn’t driver comfort come first? Even though I was able to get relatively comfortable, I was never able to put the seat exactly where I wanted.\n\nChanges to the cabin for 2009 are relatively minor and could easily go unnoticed. The audio system has been revamped and now includes a screen like the one used on models with the automaker’s Comand system. It doesn’t, however, include the integrated control knob you’ll find in a C-Class or S-Class sedan with Comand; selections are made using a set of buttons on the dash. The steering wheel is also new and the gauges have been mildly restyled.\n\nDespite the changes, the cabin is rather plain and basic when you consider the SLK350 starts at about $50,000. Some of the buttons and controls in the cabin, like the ones for the retractable hardtop and side mirrors that are located on the center console, have a low-grade look and feel.\n\nSafety\nThe SLK350 hasn’t been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but standard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, knee airbags and an electronic stability system.\n\nSLK350 in the Market\nIf you have $50,000 or more to drop on a convertible, life is obviously pretty good, and there’s no shortage of models in that price range from which to choose. If a retractable-hardtop is what you want, the 335i is a very good one that’s priced nearly identical to the SLK350 and comes with a backseat. Among roadsters, this price is also in the territory of the BMW Z4 and Porsche’s Boxster. If you’re willing to spend a little more, there are V-8-powered models like the Audi S4 Cabriolet and Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nThe SLK350 can clearly hold its own against these models in the styling department thanks to its athletic shape, top up or down, but the cabin design doesn’t make the same visual statement as the exterior, and some might find themselves wishing for more comfortable quarters. If that’s the case, your BMW dealer may hold the cure on his lot.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "I’ve always thought that to be a true sports car, a two-seater needed a certain edginess: the threat of a snap to its rear at launch, nimbleness afoot, sensitive steering.\n\nThe latest Ford Thunderbird is not a sports car. The Mustang certainly is. In that same vein, Mercedes-Benz has produced some classic two-seat cruisers that were too straight-ahead heavy to be sports cars — yet the 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG, this week’s test car, is precisely that.\n\nOf course it helps that it comes from the AMG stables, Mercedes’ hot rod wing. Just as, for instance, Audi S models, Ford SVTs, BMW’s Ms, Cadillacs with a V, Dodge, and Chryslers bearing the SRT are all symbolic of hot rod roots, so too is AMG. You don’t need to know what each letter stands for, only that they all mean thundering speed and performance.\n\nAMG’s handiwork runs though virtually the entire Mercedes lineup — sedans, sports cars, coupes, and SUVs.\n\nLike many Mercedes roadsters, this one runs a bit heavy at around 3,400 pounds, about the same as its predecessor, the SLK32 with its supercharged V-6 engine and 349 horsepower. The SLK55, with a normally aspirated V-8, gains only a handful of horsepower, yet it adds more than 50 lb.-ft. of torque. That torque not only helps haul what is essentially the same weight with smoother pull, it is also translated from motor’s twist to rear-wheel tug by a gloriously smooth, seven-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe result is a seamless flow of power that grabs at first throttle punch. Hit it too much and you kick out the rear end for a startling second until traction control gracefully intervenes. Yet that same traction system allows for bold, fast starts as the transmission moves ever upward through gears you do not even realize you are passing. Suddenly you are in seventh, and cruising. Rip out to pass in seventh, however, and it downshifts rapidly for maximum acceleration.\n\nYou could, of course, opt for the manual control buttons behind the wheel that allow you to shift on your own. It’s fun, and usually productive, but I found it a waste of my time and a waste of the transmission’s possibilities. I could not shift more precisely and smoothly than the car did on its own in automatic.\n\nMy only complaint was its somewhat jarring tendency to downshift rapidly when I backed off the throttle while rolling down a hill. It induced serious, rapid holding back, which I did not like on descending corners and would certainly not appreciate on an icy hill. Switching to manual helped here, and I could downshift or not at will.\n\nThe ride was very, very stiff, but when you are in a car that can, as Car and Driver magazine reported, rip from 0-60 in 4.3 seconds, you need the stiff, lowered stability of the AMG version.\n\nThis is one very aggressive looking Mercedes-Benz. The three-spoke star at center grille looks like the prop on an airplane’s nose. Snake-eye headlamps top ground-sucking lower air vents. Rocker panels flex beneath the doors, and the tail has a nice little flip.\n\nIt looks small — a shrunken version of the $450,000 SLR McLaren — and it makes you wonder just how much room there will be inside. Plenty. The stiffly bolstered bucket seats are flat, firm, and encompassing. Lower yourself into them and you are sitting in a deep well of space. There is virtually no storage space (the glove box was eaten by electronics), and trunk space is quite tight.\n\nAn interior touch that reflects the muscular bulge of the car’s exterior is a half-egg bump at center dash. It seems to flow through the windshield out to the hump on the hood. Inside, the egg flows downward to a central pod for navigation, audio, and climate controls, all easy to use.\n\nThe hardtop convertible roof was quick to raise and lower via a toggle switch. While the car is virtually free of turbulence with the top down and side windows raised, there was a slight rumble of wind from both rear quarters with the top up.\n\nOf course, all it took was a touch of the gas to drown that out in a vibrato quad exhaust rumble: four pipes piping at the rear of a Mercedes that can truly be called an edgy, high-performance sports car.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMercedes-Benz redesigned its smallest sports car for 2005, giving the retractable-hardtop SLK-Class roadster a 3.5-liter V-6. For 2008, an anniversary edition called Edition 10 is available and marks 10 years on the road for the SLK.\n\nFormula One racing cars and the automaker’s SLR McLaren supercar inspired the styling on the SLK-Class. It’s offered in SLK280, SLK350 and SLK55 AMG variants, and they carry on relatively unchanged for 2008. The SLK competes with the BMW M6 and Cadillac CTS-V.\n\nThe Edition 10 package, available on the SLK350, includes a standard automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels and red-stitched interior.\n\nThe SLK350 holds a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that drives a six-speed manual gearbox or an optional seven-speed automatic transmission with Touch Shift operation. This engine benefits from variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust valves.\n\nAn SLK280 version with a 228-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and either the six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic debuted in the 2006 model year. Mercedes-Benz also offers an SLK55 AMG edition with V-8 power that turns out 355 hp.\n\nExterior\nThe roadster features an arrow-shaped nose and a long hood. The SLK-Class has a steeply sloped windshield and taut body lines, and its retractable hardtop goes up or down in 22 seconds.\n\nA lowered sport suspension is available. Alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires, and the perforated and ventilated 13-inch front disc brakes have four-piston calipers.\n\nThere’s also an AMG appearance package that adds 17-inch wheels, side skirts, a front air dam with wire mesh inserts, a trunklid spoiler and a lowered suspension. It’s available on either the SLK280 or SLK350.\n\nInterior\nThe roadster’s interior features silver-colored switches and trim elements. The sculpted dashboard blends into the door panels on each side. Large chronometer-style gauges dominate the two-passenger cockpit. Trunk space is 6.5 cubic feet with the top down and 9.8 cubic feet with the top up.\n\nFor cool-weather driving with the top down, an optional Airscarf neck-level heating system blows warm air from the headrests.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn the SLK350 model, a 3.5-liter V-6 with variable timing for both intake and exhaust valves develops 268 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque. The SLK280 roadster contains a 228-hp, 3.0-liter twin-cam V-6. Either the six-speed manual gearbox or the seven-speed automatic with Touch Shift operation can be installed. A 355-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 powers the SLK55 AMG, which comes with the seven-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. A BabySmart child-recognition system prevents the front passenger-side airbag from activating.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcceleration is energetic and refined with the 3.5-liter engine. Automatic-transmission operation can be rude. It can get jerky at low speeds in lower gears and delivers a sizable jolt if you hit the gas pedal while slowing down.\n\nSteering and handling are strong points, inspiring confidence and poised behavior. Better yet, the SLK’s ride is easily tolerable for a sports car of this caliber. Sure you feel the bumps, but most are dispensed with rather handily.\n\nThe seats are adeptly supportive and snugly bolstered, yet surprisingly comfortable. Space is ample inside, and top-up visibility isn’t bad. When parking, however, the driver may have no clue where the pointy front end is located. Wide doors make parking-lot spots a problem.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new high-performance SLK32 AMG version of the two-seat roadster has emerged for 2002. It now comes equipped with a supercharged, 349-horsepower V-6 engine, racing-derived brakes and a new AMG Speedshift transmission. Only 1,000 of them are destined for the U.S. market, priced at $54,900. A new Sport Package, inspired by the SLK32 AMG, is also available for the regular SLK-Class models and includes a fresh front air dam, rocker panels and a rear valance.\n\nOther than these new additions, the SLK-Class roadsters carry on as before with their retractable steel hardtops that fold into a dual-hinged trunk. Face-lifted for 2001, the SLK320 contains a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 engine. The original SLK230 Kompressor uses a supercharged four-cylinder engine that makes 192 hp. Both have Mercedes-Benzs Electronic Stability Program. A six-speed-manual transmission became available in 2001, and an automatic unit is also offered.\n\nIntroduced in 1998, the SLK230 was the first modern car to have a retractable metal roof  an idea that harks back to Fords of the late 1950s but has occasionally been employed over the years. The SLK-Class models compete against the BMW Z3 and Porsche Boxster and cost about half as much as the V-8-powered Mercedes-Benz SL500. Mercedes-Benz sold 11,268 SLK-Class roadsters during 2001, which represents a drop from the 12,930 units that reached customers in 2000, according to Automotive News.\n\nExterior\nLast years face-lift included new front and rear aprons, body-colored door handles, sculpted rocker panels and revised two-color taillights, along with the addition of a new rear stabilizer bar. Serving as Mercedes-Benzs smallest model in the United States, the SLK-Class is just a little bigger than the Mazda MX-5 Miata. Measuring 50.4 inches tall and 157.9 inches long overall, the SLK-Class sits on a 94.5-inch wheelbase that is 5 inches longer than the Miatas.\n\nPush a button on the console and the articulating metal roof raises or retracts automatically into the dual-hinged trunk space. The trunk opens in two different modes: at the front to accept the roof, or at the rear to fit a small amount of luggage. The top-down process takes about 25 seconds. Door mirrors feature integrated turn-signal flashers. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are available as part of an option group that also includes headlight washers and heated seats.\n\nThe new SLK32 AMG gets a special, recalibrated, reinforced suspension with unique spring rates and shock-absorber valving. Double-spoke alloy wheels on the SLK32 AMG hold 17-inch P225/45ZR17 tires up front and P245/40ZR17 tires in the rear. A front air dam incorporates AMG fog lights, while a small lip spoiler at the rear of the trunk lid is said to reduce aerodynamic lift by more than 50 percent.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants get leather bucket seats. Standard equipment includes dual-zone air conditioning, an interior air filter, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power windows and door locks, heated power mirrors and a Bose cassette stereo system. In addition to the V-6 engine and wood interior trim, the SLK320 has eight-way power seats and a telescoping steering wheel, both of which are available as options for the SLK230.\n\nSport seats in the new SLK32 AMG are upholstered in two-tone Nappa leather and are equipped with integrated headrests and what Mercedes-Benz calls aggressive side bolsters. Two-tone leather trim throughout the interior mates with dark birds-eye maple wood. Mercedes-Benzs Tele Aid emergency assistance system includes such functions as vehicle diagnostics, remote door unlocking and alarm monitoring.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe hottest engine of the SLK-Class lot is the new supercharged Kompressor V-6 in the SLK32 AMG, which whips out 349 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. The new Speedshift transmission in the SLK32 AMG promises shifts that are up to 35 percent faster than those in a conventional automatic. By tipping the gear lever to the left, the transmission will determine the best possible gear for maximum acceleration in any situation. Mercedes-Benz claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.8 seconds, calling this model the quickest Mercedes-Benz ever.\n\nThe supercharged, 2.3-liter, dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine in the SLK230 Kompressor roadster is rated at 192 hp. Moving up to the SLK320 brings a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 power plant. Both engines can team with either the standard six-speed-manual transmission or an optional five-speed-automatic unit that incorporates Touch Shift for manual gear changes simply by tipping the lever to the left or right.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are standard. A BabySmart child-recognition system keeps the front-passenger airbag from activating if a small child is seated in that position.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA Special Edition of Mercedes-Benz’s lower-priced retractable-hardtop convertible has joined the lineup for 2004. Equipped with polished 17-inch wheels, the Special Edition SLK-Class roadster features a painted grille, a rear spoiler, special sport seats and Nappa leather-covered roll bars.\n\nA high-performance SLK32 AMG version contains a 349-horsepower supercharged V-6 engine, racing-derived brakes and AMG’s SpeedShift five-speed-automatic transmission. A Sport Package inspired by the SLK32 AMG is available for regular SLK-Class models. Redesigned SLK-Class models arrive in the 2005 model year.\n\nExterior\nMercedes-Benz’s smallest sports car features sculpted rocker panels and sits on a 94.5-inch wheelbase — that’s 5 inches longer than the Mazda Miata’s. Push a button and the articulating metal roof rises or retracts automatically in about 25 seconds. The trunk opens at the front to accept the roof or at the rear to reveal a small luggage compartment. The door mirrors feature integrated turn-signal flashers.\n\nThe SLK32 AMG gets a recalibrated, reinforced suspension with unique spring rates and shock-absorber valving. Twin-five-spoke, 17-inch alloy wheels on the SLK32 AMG hold P225/45ZR17 tires up front and P245/40ZR17 tires in the rear. A front air dam incorporates AMG fog lights.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants get leather bucket seats. Standard equipment includes dual-zone air conditioning, an interior air filter, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a Bose cassette stereo. In addition to wood trim, the SLK320 has eight-way power seats and a telescoping steering wheel. Maximum cargo space is 9.5 cubic feet, but that space shrinks to 3.9 cubic feet when the top is down.\n\nSport seats in the SLK32 AMG are upholstered in Nappa leather and feature integrated headrests and what Mercedes-Benz calls “substantial” side bolsters. Leather trim and dark bird’s-eye maple are used.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe hottest engine in the SLK-Class lineup is the supercharged 3.2-liter V-6 in the SLK32 AMG, which whips up 349 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque. Mercedes-Benz claims the AMG SpeedShift five-speed-automatic transmission produces shifts that are up to 35 percent faster than those of a conventional automatic. Mercedes-Benz claims a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.8 seconds.\n\nThe supercharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine in the SLK230 Kompressor roadster is rated at 192 hp. Moving up to the SLK320 brings a 215-hp, 3.2-liter V-6. Both engines can team with a six-speed-manual gearbox or an optional five-speed automatic that incorporates TouchShift manual gear selection.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an Electronic Stability Program are standard. A BabySmart child seat-recognition system prevents the front-passenger airbag from deploying when a known child-safety seat is installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe SLK is agile and nimble and maneuvers like a traditional small sports car. With the 2.3-liter engine and an automatic transmission, acceleration is rather energetic, though well short of the big Benzes, and there’s little evidence of the supercharger’s operation. The SLK is a little less solid and a bit bouncier on the road than its larger cousins — but not by much. Space is quite plentiful for two people.",
