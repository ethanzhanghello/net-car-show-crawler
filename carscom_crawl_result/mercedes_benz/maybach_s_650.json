      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class is the flagship passenger car of the Mercedes-Benz fleet and serves as a luxury and technological showcase for the brand. It comes in sedan, coupe and convertible body styles with a wide range of twin-turbocharged engines and rear- or all-wheel drive. S 450 models use a 362-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6; the S 560 uses a 463-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8; and the Maybach S 650 has a 621-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter V-12. The performance-oriented AMG S 63 has a variant of the 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 603 hp, while the AMG S 65 has a 621-hp V-12 like the S 650. The S 450, S 560 and AMG S 63 all come with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the Maybach S 650 and AMG S 65 use a seven-speed automatic. The S-Class competes with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS and Maserati Quattroporte. Maybach versions, meanwhile, are ultraluxury models aimed at Bentley and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nA new plug-in hybrid S-Class sedan, the S 560e, is slated to arrive in mid-2019. It has an onboard 7.2-kilowatt charger for faster charging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Are Most Important?\n\nAs Mercedes' technological showcase, the S-Class offers several advanced driver assistance and semi-autonomous driving features. Among them are adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, steering assist, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring and a 360-degree camera system. The systems can help steer the car and change lanes (when the turn signal is activated), slow the car when heading into turns and provide automatic braking, among other tasks. An Energizing Comfort feature works with the climate control, in-cabin fragrance system, audio system and available massaging front seats to coddle occupants through muscle relaxation and other physical and ambient features designed to make them feel better. Available Magic Body Control uses cameras to detect the road ahead and adjust the suspension in milliseconds to maintain a smooth ride.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class?\n\nThe S-Class historically has represented the best Mercedes has to offer in luxury, convenience, technology and safety, so this is the place to go for the brand's latest and greatest. There is plenty to like in the S-Class line, but there is so much to digest that a three-year lease might expire before you've mastered it all.",
