      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMercedes says the GLE-Class is a refresh on the M-Class, though its name is different. The SUV comes in many variants, from the diesel GLE300d to the turbo V-8 GLE63.\n\nExteriorTypical of a refresh, the GLE-Class’ styling is evolutionary from the M-Class; this isn’t a styling sea change. The profile, face and tail remain generally the same, save reshaped bumper openings and updated headlights; LED headlights are optional. Mercedes-AMG models have twin-bar grilles.\n\nWheels range from 17-inchers on the GLE300d all the way up to 21s on the AMGs. Other AMG additions include a rear bumper diffuser and quad tailpipe finishers. If you want the AMG look without the power or price, various AMG Line exterior packages lend some of the styling.\n\nOptional off-road provisions include a two-speed transfer case, a locking center differential and an adaptive air suspension that can raise ground clearance to 11 inches for a maximum water-fording depth of nearly 2 feet. The air suspension can also include active stabilizer bars that counter body roll in real time; the feature is standard on AMG models.\n\nInteriorLike the exterior, the GLE’s interior represents an update over the M-Class. The center controls are more squared off, with a screen that juts out above the dashboard, though not as much as the tabletlike screen in some Mercedes models. The screen itself measures 7 inches, with an 8-inch screen if you add optional multimedia features.\n\nLike the redesigned C-Class, the GLE hosts Mercedes’ latest Comand system, which incorporates a touchpad controller above the traditional knob. Optional premium stereos come from Harman Kardon or Bang & Olufsen.\n\nAluminum cabin trim is standard. Optional trim includes piano-black lacquer, carbon fiber or four wood finishes, one of them open-pore. MB-Tex vinyl upholstery is standard, and full leather is optional. AMG models have an MB-Tex dashboard finish, unique gauges, a flat-bottom steering wheel and AMG-badged, leather sport seats.\n\nMercedes’ Dynamic Select system has up to seven different modes that optimize various driving systems for better handling, off-road capability, poor weather and more.\n\nUnder the HoodMercedes offers six drivetrains in the GLE-Class. The GLE300d gets a diesel four-cylinder that’s good for 201 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, while the GLE350 gets a 302-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The GLE400 has a 329-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nThe plug-in GLE550e teams a gasoline V-6 with a 114-hp electric motor for a combined 436 hp. The motor draws energy off a rechargeable 8.8-kilowatt-hour, lithium-ion battery, and Mercedes says you can go 18.6 miles solely on electric power. Drivers can alternate between four driving modes to maximize electric range or preserve it for later.\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG GLE63 and GLE63 S are the lineup’s highest performers, with rear-biased all-wheel drive and a turbocharged, 5.5-liter V-8 that’s rated at 550 hp (GLE63) or 577 hp (GLE63 S).\n\nAll models get a seven-speed automatic transmission, with a quicker-shifting setup in the AMGs. All-wheel drive is standard on all but the base, rear-drive GLE350.\n\nSafetyMercedes’ Collision Prevention Assist Plus, a forward collision warning system with automatic braking, is standard. Typical of new Mercedes vehicles, the GLE-Class offers all manner of semiautonomous driving systems, including all-speed adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detecting automatic braking and active steering with lane keeping and blind spot intervention. Around-view cameras and active parking assist are also optional.",
