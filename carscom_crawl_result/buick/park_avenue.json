      "expert_review": "The 1995 Buick Park Avenue Ultra is a roomy, comfortable package with all the amenities, plus dual air bags and ABS standard, traction control an option-though it should be standard for thefew pennies it adds to Buick’s cost. The 3.8-liter, 225-h.p., V-6 engine issupercharged to provide all the power you need to merge or climb that hill.Very pleasant suspension with road-gripping, 16-inch tires.\n\nNice to have the fuel-filler door and trunk-lid openers on the dash. Nicetouches: Automatic door locks; dual cupholders in rear-seat, fold-down, centerarmrest; vanity mirrors that fold from rear roof; massive trunk;driver/passenger air/heat controls.\n\nShortcoming: Styling left over from Billy Durant era-chrome bodysidemoldings, chrome door handles that extend from body like they did when Ike wasPresident.

      "expert_review": "Political correctness is losing its luster.\n\nThese days, some people start mumbling nasty things about your mother when you mention something politically correct. These days, political incorrectness seems to be correct.\n\nSuch is the case with cars. Cruise around in a Buick Park Avenue Ultra for a week and you’ll get the sudden urge to smoke a cigar. (They’re back in style now, too.)\n\nOpen the door and step back to a time when American cars were kings of the road. There to greet you is a split bench seat swathed in leather with gentle contours redolent of sofa cushions. Shaped for those who enjoy living large, they’re soft but not overly supportive. They’re electrically heated, too. (Please, no jokes about giving your spouse the electric chair.)\n\nThe dash is as flat as Nebraska, very unlike today’s more driver-oriented contoured dashboards. Everything is logically arranged, but the radio can be a stretch. Thankfully, Buick mounts duplicates of the most-used controls on the steering wheel. Very convenient.\n\nAnd this whole car is about convenience, loaded with an arsenal of luxury gear that makes coddling the occupants its first concern.\n\n“Personal Choice,” a new option for ’96, will remember and recall two different settings for seats, mirrors, lighting, security and more when the keyless entry is activated.\n\nTired of slamming your trunk? A power pull-down assists. An AM/FM-cassette-CD unit plays your favorite tunes with clarity. Power windows, locks, seats and mirrors are, of course, standard. Climate control is automatic. So is the general sense of comfort and serenity. Door locks lock and unlock automatically. Shoulder belts are adjustable.\n\nThe rearview mirror adjusts automatically for lighting conditions, and contains a compass to make sure you stay pointed in the right direction.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest luxury is the space available here. Six full-sized, well-fed Americans will fit, as long as they don’t mind those seat contours. The trunk holds 20 cubic feet of luggage, golf clubs or cases of smuggled Cuban cigars.\n\nSo how does it drive?\n\nHere comes that political correctness again.\n\nIn today’s world of taut-handling sport sedans, the Ultra is a throwback. Hit a bump and the response is a bit of mild bouncing. It’s not uncontrollable, because the optional Gran Touring suspension keeps things pretty well controlled. But this car is a Buick, and that means it’s softly sprung with a classic American big-car ride. It won’t rattle your dentures.\n\nIt won’t require you to shout at fellow passengers, either. The ride is quiet and hushed. Even when you ask for speed.\n\nStomp on the accelerator and it moves faster than a lot of sport coupes. Credit Buick’s trusty old supercharged 3.8 liter V-6. In Ultra form, it now produces 240 horsepower, up 15 from last year and good for 0-to-60 times of under eight seconds. This power does not c ome at the expense of fuel economy: The EPA rating is 18 mpg city, 27 highway. The supercharged engine requires premium unleaded fuel.\n\nSteering on the Ultra is GM’s new magnetic-variable assist system that boosts assist at low speeds and reduces it as the scenery moves by faster. It feels somewhat disconnected from the road.\n\nStopping is courtesy of four-wheel anti-lock brakes, disc in front, drum in rear. An optional traction-control system uses anti-lock brakes and trims power from the engine to regain traction. Both worked admirably.\n\nBut this whole car works admirably as a modern iteration of Detroit’s large family sedan. The 1996 Buick Park Avenue Ultra’s space, features, comfort and speed will satisfy anyone who can’t find luxury in a small, hard-riding imported car.\n\nBut then, they probably never were politically correct, either. Buick Park Avenue Ultra Highlights: Supercharged 3.8 liter V-6, dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, power door locks power windows, power seats with memory feature, keyless entry, variable power steering, automatic level control, dual air conditioning, power antenna, cruise control, AM/FM-cassette-CD, electrically heated driver and passenger seats, traction control, leather seats.\n\nBase Price: $32,820\n\nOptions: $1,371\n\nDestination charge: $640\n\nTotal: $34,831",

      "expert_review": "IT WAS A serious car, midnight blue with gray interior. It had afine body, Jaguaresque in appearance. But the dark paint muted thesensuality of that shape. Even the bright molding, wrapped around thecar’s lower panels, seemed bereft of levity.\n\nStill, I liked the thing, the 1993 Buick Park Avenue Ultra. I likedsitting in it. It had big, comfortable, leather-faced seats. And it wasneat the way the instrument panel curved around the front end of thepassenger cabin until it disappeared into the doors.\n\nBut I felt a little strange in the Park Avenue Ultra on the SaturdayI drove it. Saturday is get-funky time. But it’s hard to get funky in acar that prefers pin stripes over denim. So I wore a blazer and dressshirt with my jeans, and cranked up the engine.\n\nYou should’ve heard that engine! It was deep and throaty — kind ofmade me smile. I mean, here was this car, all proper and everything,with an engine that sounded like a love scene between Madonna and ArnoldSchwarzenegger. Hoooah!\n\nI headed for I-95, bound for New York. The car could move. I washaving a good time until I pulled into the parking lot of the MarylandHouse, a public rest stop along I-95.\n\nChurch people were getting off a bus that identified them as churchpeople. Some of them stopped to admire the Park Avenue Ultra, whichlooked clerical in repose.\n\n“Beautiful car, young man,” one of the church ladies said. I glowed.Forty-five years old and chubby, and some woman’s calling me “youngman.” I sucked in my gut, for naught. “You a minister?” she asked.\n\nBackground: The Park Avenue is the top-of-the-line Buick; the Ultrais the top-of-the-line Park Avenue. The car is thus a bona fideluxmobile, a worthy competitor of Lexus, Cadillac, Acura Legend, Audi,Jaguar, Infiniti, Lincoln and 300-series Mercedes-Benz models.\n\nThe Park Avenue Ultra has a softer ride than many of its rivals,especially softer than those from Germany. But that’s okay for the waymost Americans use cars — to commute, shop and take occasional vacationtrips.\n\nThere are two models: the base sedan and the Ultra. The primarydistinction between the two is the engine. The base Park Avenue isequipped with a 3.8-liter V-6 rated 170 horsepower at 4,800 rpm, with amaximum torque rating of 225 pound-feet at 3,200 rpm. The Ultra comeswith a supercharged version of that engine rated 205 horsepower at 4,400rpm, with torque put at 260 pound-feet at 2,600 rpm.\n\nComplaints: I wish that the driver’s seat didn’t have so darned manypower adjustments. It’s great once you get it right; but getting itright is an absolute pain.\n\nAlso, the side-view mirrors need redesign. They’re small, oddlyshaped things. Getting them angled right is a hassle, too.\n\nA driver’s air bag is standard. But competitors in the luxmobilecategory often come with two standard bags, for the driver and the frontpassenger. Any car named Ultra ought to be a two-bagger.\n\nPraise: Excellent overall design; a superi or long-distance runner.The front-wheel-drive Park Avenue Ultra seats six people comfortably,but for maximum comfort, throw the sixth person out. Anti-lock powerfront disc/rear drum brakes are standard.\n\nAlso, insurance companies love the car. Insurance over five years is$7,274 for this big car, which gets an “excellent” rating fromIntelliChoice Inc., an automotive marketing and research firm. Thecompany also gives the Park Avenue Ultra an overall “excellent” ratingfor ownership costs over five years.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and acceleration.Handling might leave something to be desired among people accustomed tothe taut responsiveness of German luxury cars. In short, there’s morethan a little float in the Park Avenue Ultra, especially around tightcurves. Braking is excellent.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and compact disc player, Delco/BoseMusic System. It’s better than any sound system Mercedes-Benz ever putin its cars.\n\nMileage: A bout 23 to the gallon (18-gallon tank, estimated 403-milerange on useable volume of recommended premium unleaded), running mostlyhighway with one to three occupants and light cargo.\n\nPark Avenue models are equipped with standard, four-speed, electronicautomatic transmissions. Automatics tend to be less fuel-economical thanmanual transmissions.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Park Avenue Ultra is $29,395. Dealer invoiceprice on that model is $25,427. Price as tested is $29,995, including a$600 destination charge. Average taxes and fees could push the figure to$30,484, according to IntelliChoice.\n\nPurse-strings note: A seriously good luxury value for the money.Compare with any car in the $30,000-plus, full-size luxury category.",

      "expert_review": "The Buick Park Avenue Ultra is not all-new for 1994. It sports the same sheet metal and essentially the same engine as it did a year ago. About the only difference between the ’94 and the ’93, other than a price increase of $2,304, is that the ’94 is a better car because Buick focused on making a few minor changes that result in major improvements.\n\nThe ’94 Park Avenue Ultra we test-drove offered dual air bags; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; traction control; heated seats; radio and temperature controls in the steering-wheel hub; non-CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) air conditioning; a 20-horsepower boost in the supercharged V-6 engine; and remote, keyless entry. Only the traction control and heated seats are options.\n\nThe dual bags, anti-lock brakes and traction control provide an umbrella insurance policy. Though traction control is an option, we highly recommend it. It helps you get moving in a straight line on slippery pavement, just like anti-lock brakes help you stop in a straight line on slippery surfaces.\n\nRadio and temperature controls in the steering-wheel hub also can be considered safety items, because you can change stations or dial up the heat without taking your eyes off the road.\n\nThe non-Freon air conditioning is better for the environment, and, like motherhood, apple pie and cupholders, that can’t be knocked.\n\nYou can’t knock the remote, keyless entry, either. When your hands are full of packages, or when you are strolling through a dark parking lot on the way to your car, it’s good to know you only need to press a button on the key fob and your doors unlock and the interior lights go on.\n\nThe 20-horsepower boost, to 225, in the 3.8-liter engine comes in handy on occasion-such as when you’re merging onto the Kennedy Expressway, moving into the passing lane on Interstate Highway 94 or simply pulling four adults and a trunk full of luggage up one of those steep hills in southern Wisconsin. The mileage rating is a respectable 17 m.p.g. city/27 highway. Based on how slowly the gauge moved during our test, 17/27 seemed conservative.\n\nGranted, you don’t need the extra horsepower all the time, but it’s nice to have it in reserve, like the traction control. We called up the supercharger on three occasions-once in merging onto the Kennedy when a fellow in an Accord decided he wanted to pass on the merger ramp (he didn’t do it); another when trying to merge into the Kennedy express lanes in morning rush-hour traffic, when cars in those lanes sail along at 70 m.p.h. and don’t take to intruders too kindly (we slipped in); and a third time when trying to maneuver around the fleet of Yellow and Checker cabs parked along Rush Street outside the Marriott Hotel, trying to shut the road to traffic (we slipped around but had to suffer verbal abuse from the drivers).\n\nThe one feature we could do without is the heated seats-at least until the mad enginee r who chose the location for the on/off switch along the bottom left side of the driver’s seat comes to his or her senses and moves that switch to the instrument panel.\n\nAbout halfway down the Kennedy in one evening’s rush we suddenly thought middle age had struck, as hot flashes rushed through our body. After a few rushes we realized the heat was coming from the seat-in waves. There was no button on the dash or console armrest, no light in the instrument panel advising that the heated seats were on and, more important, indicating how to turn them off.\n\nAfter fumbling around the seat for several moments, we found the switch. We had accidentally activated it when pulling the safety belts from the door pillar. A red light next to the switch flashes on to let you know the system is active, as if the aroma of burning flesh didn’t serve as early enough warning. But who is going to see a red light at the bottom of the driver’s seat. How hot was it? The seat heats to 107.6 degrees. If you haven’t discarded polyester from your wardrobe by know, you will if you get the heated seats in the Park Avenue Ultra. Please move the switch, fellas.\n\nWhen redesigning the seat heater switch, Buick also needs to come up with a change in the outside rearview mirrors. The Park Avenue driver- and passenger-side windows come with a fake vent glass in a thick frame. The frame is so thick that the outside mirrors had to be positioned farther back on the door. The location and tiny size of the mirrors make it difficult to focus on what’s behind or alongside you and to determine how far away it is.\n\nThose aggravations should be dealt with, because Buick took pains to focus on details to make the driving experience very pleasant. Seats are wide and supportive and the most comfortable in the industry. You’d like to take them with you into the den. Interior room is spacious, and most instruments are positioned for easy use, although we would prefer that the light switches, which are in the driver’s door, would be on the dash.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the touring suspension, which means total road comfort and the feeling of control over the driving environment. No road abrasions filter into the seat or the wheel to disturb you. The suspension is in harmony with the road.\n\nOther nice features include a center arm housing dual cup, change and cassette holders; and dual sun visors with large visors you can swing to the side to block glare while you keep the small visors in place to prevent glare from ahead. The big visor has a slip-out shade you can position over the inside rearview mirror to prevent glare from slipping into the cabin.\n\nOne other item worth noting is the sharply sloped hood. In most cars, when the hood slopes like that it disappears from the driver’s view. That leaves the driver with the impression he or she has only 3 inches of crush space ahead. The Park Avenue, however, sports a Buick crest ornament on the hood, which gives you the perspective that the hood is 6 feet long and that you have ample metal in front as protection in an impact. Nice touch.\n\nThe base price is $31,699, and all the power items and comfort and convenience features are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Buick is not out of the woods yet.\n\nTrue, the General Motors division was the only American automaker to post an improvement in sales in 1991.\n\nAnd, yes, Buick is building cars that consistently rank among the best-built, most trouble-free in the industry.\n\nBut one wonders when Buick will take the next step.\n\nWhen will Buick raise the level of refinement in its cars to match that of comparably priced imports?\n\nBuick already has several huge advantages over most of the competition: The division’s cars are built well, styled nicely, offer more safety features and get better gas mileage.\n\nBut this week’s Park Avenue – and several other GM products I have tested recently – shows the automaker is not keeping pace with many imports in the same price range when it comes to refinement and attention to detail.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIt takes a sharp eye to tell the difference between a supercharged Park Avenue Ultra and a standard version. Only the wheels are different, and the trunk lid contains a small, ”supercharged” script in chrome.\n\nHowever, press the accelerator and the difference is readily apparent.\n\nThe supercharged Park Avenue Ultra performs much like the powerful big-engined Buick sedans of the ’60s and ’70s.\n\nIt has plenty of muscle. The car’s 3.8-liter V-6 develops 210 horsepower.\n\nThe engine is smooth and quiet, but a heavy foot provokes a wonderful symphony of mechanical sounds as the engine revs up and breathes in massive gulps of air.\n\nA supercharger may connote visions of dragsters and jacked-up hot rods because those are the types of vehicles where this performance-increasing device most often is used.\n\nSuperchargers blast more fuel into the engine, and that increases power. Unlike a turbocharger, which is powered by exhaust gases, a supercharger is either belt-or gear-driven.\n\nBuick engineers have tuned their supercharged engine to deliver civilized performance.\n\nThis car comes onlywith GM’s computer-controlled four-speed automatic, which parcels out the power to the front wheels with finesse in normal driving conditions.\n\nHowever, on slippery roads the car must be driven with a light foot because the front tires can lose traction and send the car veering to the left or right.\n\nTraction control – a computerized device that prevents tires from spinning on slippery pavement – is optional, but the test car did not have it. Traction control should come standard on all supercharged Park Avenue Ultras.\n\nThe test car delivered 19 mile per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on a trip to Daytona Beach.\n\nHANDLING\n\nWith a set of bucket seats and a floor shifter, Buick probably could market the supercharged Park Ultra as a sports sedan. But it comes only with bench seats and a column shifter.\n\nThough the Park Avenue Ultra has a rather soft and bump-absorbing ride, it still retains its poise in fast cornering maneuvers and in spirited driv ing. It would, in fact, be a joy to drive this way were it not for the seats, which fail to hold driver and passengers firmly in place.\n\nThe variable effort rack and pinion steering seems connected to your subconscious – response is instantaneous, crisp and accurate.\n\nVariable effort, by the way, means that the effort required to turn the steering wheel changes with the speed of the vehicle. At slower speeds, it’s easier to turn, but at higher speeds, the steering wheel is a bit harder.\n\nThe power-assisted anti-lock brakes – discs up front and drums in the rear – are powerful.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe test car was put together well, but I never could get comfortable in it.\n\nThe driver’s seat was terrible. The bottom cushion was too soft, and I sort of sank into it.\n\nHowever, the seats looked nice with an embroidered ”Ultra” on the seat backs.\n\nI also didn’t care for the unlighted, chrome-covered window switches on the door panels. They were ha d to use at night and looked like something out of 1965.\n\nThe electric door locks worked fine, but they w ere loud and clunky to the point of being annoying.\n\nThe interior has several nice touches. For instance, Buick’s air-conditioning system lets the driver and passenger control air temperature on their side of the car.\n\nRear passengers also have sun visors with vanity lights. Also, there is generous room in the back seat for three adults, plus a trunk large enough to carry four or five full-size suitcases.\n\nI like the supercharged Park Avenue’s performance. I like the way it is built.\n\nBut Buick has to move on now and start engineering greater comfort and refinement into its cars.",

      "expert_review": "Changed circumstances can alter your viewpoint. Take the matter of the 2002 Buick Park Avenue Ultra, the biggest of the Buick sedans.\n\nI had uncharitably considered the car a wallow-mobile, a rolling land yacht, an automobile designed more for passengers than drivers.\n\nBut that was before a second transplant surgery relegated me to the role of passenger for a month.\n\nDuring my first week of recovery, a Toyota Highlander wagon/sport-utility vehicle was available. It was a wonderfully crafted machine, a less expensive version of the mechanically and structurally identical Lexus RX300.\n\nThe Highlander was loaded with comfort-giving options, too, including heated seats. But, though based on a car platform, it rides higher than most traditional large sedans. That made getting in and out of the vehicle, with two dozen staples in my abdomen, a painful chore. I began to dread having to go anywhere in the Highlander.\n\nThe Park Avenue Ultra arrived a week later. It proved to be a blessing, the kindest thing General Motors Corp. ever did for the surgically impaired. Entering and exiting the Park Avenue Ultra was easy, front seat or equally comfortable back. I simply slid in and out. Spring-loaded grips, attached to the roof above the outboard sides of the front and rear seats, assisted ingress and egress.\n\nMy chauffeur on these outings, mostly to and from the hospital for post-surgical follow-ups, was my wife, Mary Anne. Lately, she tends to feel hot in even the coldest weather, which is a problem for me. I start shivering whenever the temperature drops below 69 degrees.\n\nBut the Park Avenue Ultra offered a solution: individual temperature controls for the driver and the front-seat passenger. In the past, I had considered this feature a technological bauble, a silly thing designed to milk consumers for more money.\n\nBut that was when my wife was the front-seat passenger and I was the driver. Little did I know that she would secretly lower the temperature on her side of similarly equipped test cars whenever I raised the temperature on my side to 75 degrees. I used to wonder why she didn’t complain. Now I know why.\n\nThere were other discovered pleasures in the Park Avenue Ultra. The seats, also equipped with automatic heating, were as comfortable as those found in substantially more expensive cars, including the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7-Series sedans.\n\nThe ride was soft. But that was perfectly fine with me. When you’re hurting, you don’t want to feel every bump in the road, and I felt very little in the Park Avenue Ultra.\n\nHandling was not as crisp as found in some European sedans and any number of sports cars. But I didn’t give a pahooty about that. What I wanted was maximum comfort, and that is what the Park Avenue Ultra gave. Assuming that convalescence continues going as well as its going, I’ll be back behind the wheel soon, and t here will be time and opportunity enough for speed and curves.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Park Avenue occupies the top rung of Buicks four-step car ladder, superseding the others in size and price. The major addition for this front-drive luxury sedan is an ultrasonic parking assist feature as a new option. When the transmission is in reverse, sensors in the rear bumper detect when the car is close to other objects and activates visual and audible warnings.\n\nOnStar, General Motors satellite-based communication and navigation system, is a new standard feature on the Park Avenue Ultra and a new factory-installed option on the base Park Avenue. OnStar previously was available as a dealer-installed option.\n\nThe Park Avenue is built from the same basic design as the Buick LeSabre, Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile Aurora and other full-size GM cars, though each has its own unique styling and features.\n\nExterior\nThe Park Avenue has the same basic look as Buicks other sedans, but it is bigger. At 207 inches from stem to stern, it is 7 inches longer than the LeSabre, Buicks lower-priced, family-oriented counterpart.\n\nBoth the base model and the Ultra have a classic Buick-style grille with vertical chrome bars. The Ultra has less chrome trim and different aluminum wheels to separate it from the base Park Avenue.\n\nInterior\nThe roomy interior has standard seats for six, though on both models, the front bench is split 55/45, shaped for two and comes with a folding center armrest that contains cupholders and storage space. Bucket seats are optional on the Ultra.\n\nLeather is standard on the Ultra and optional on the base model, and the wood trim in the Ultra is real. The spacious trunk holds 19 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase models come with a 205-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 engine, and Ultras pack a supercharged version of this engine with 240 hp. The base engine takes regular gasoline, and the supercharged one requires premium gas. Both team with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStabiliTrak, a lateral-skid control feature, is standard on the Ultra and optional on the base model. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and antilock brakes are standard on both, and traction control is standard on the Ultra and optional on the base model.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "As motorists age, they often want a few more pounds and several more inches of protection wrapped around them.\n\nThe full-size 2000 Buick Park Avenue sedan does just that, a long, wide, nearly 4,000-pound heavyweight.\n\nAs motorists age, they also demand easier entry and exit from the vehicle and lots of room to stretch the bones once inside.\n\nThe full-size Park Avenue delivers again, with wide-opening doors, comfy and cozy seats and sufficient space for heads, legs and arms.\n\nAs motorists age, they also want a trunk that will hold the luggage used on numerous and lengthy trips.\n\nPark Avenue to the rescue one more time.\n\nAnd as motorists age, they want an engine powerful enough to haul them and the luggage and still make it up hills without straining. And more important, an engine that will scoot them into the merger lane without hesitation when afforded only a small window of opportunity to join the crowd.\n\nYup. The Park Avenue again.\n\nAnd for 2000, the full-size Buick sedan adds another benefit that older and mature drivers–in fact, drivers of any age–will appreciate: StabiliTrak, the stability-control system borrowed from Cadillac that senses when you are about to overdrive the limits of the car and are in danger of sliding or skidding. It slows and stabilizes the car to help you maintain control.\n\nStabiliTrak earns its keep primarily on wet, snowy or icy roads as well as during sudden evasive maneuvers. It’s a security blanket.\n\nIn addition to StabiliTrak, the Park Avenue Ultra we tested came with four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock; traction control that regulates engine fuel flow as well as the ABS to bring a slippery or skidding wheel under control; variable-effort steering with higher pressure at higher speeds and lower pressure at low speeds, such as when trying to park a 4,000-pound sedan.\n\nAnd there are dual front as well as side-impact air bags, the latter in the sides of the front seats so they move with you whenever the seat is motored forward or back, rather than housed in the doors where any seat movement can distance you from the protection.\n\nExcellent package of features, further complemented by Gran Touring suspension designed with a bit firmer sho ck/spring settings and larger stabilizer bars to optimize handling in a large car without any offsetting ride stiffness.\n\nAnd the supercharged V-6 serves a dual purpose. It provides 6-cylinder fuel economy for a 4,000-pound car (18 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway) when cruising along the interstate, but delivers V-8 energy when called upon to move those pounds quickly from the light, into/out of the passing lane, down the merger ramp or up the incline. And it performs quietly.\n\nTough to fault the Park Avenue, though we found a few flaws. The most noticeable is that the 113.8-inch wheelbase and 206.8-inch overall length has become perhaps more than a bit outdated. It appears, based on consumer preferences for so-called smaller, entry-level luxury cars, that what motorists want is the interior room of a Park Avenue but the exterior dimensions of a midsize Buick Century.\n\nPark Avenue’s size is OK if you have a three-car garage, and you park in the middle wit h nothing on either side. But when slipping between the lines in the vacant opening at church, we found we had to swing wide to get the nose pointed properly and the back end to follow the same path. At church you should always utter, “blessed be God,” not “this blessed Buick . . .”\n\nAlso, because this is a full-size luxury sedan, it came covered with cowhide everywhere. If a few patches of cloth or suede had been applied to the seat back and bottom, the seats would not only be cooler in the summertime and less frigid in the winter, but they also would be less slippery in any season when making those evasive or emergency maneuvers that Buick thought necessary to control with StabiliTrak.\n\nUpfront, our test car came with the optional “convenience” console, a $185 plastic mound that separates the front seats and forces buckets to replace a bench. Awfully big console, even if it does offer lots of goodies, such as flip-out-and-over cupholders and cell-phone holder, flip-up plastic writing tray, coin holders, power plug and stowage bins. A little slimmer design would be nice.\n\nLast gripe is strictly personal–the name. Maybe when the next-generation Park Avenue appears it would be time to reach into the bag and come up with something fresh to denote a fresh vehicle. The LaCrosse, the name used on the Buick concept sedan of the future on this year’s auto-show circuit, sounds nice.\n\nThe Park Avenue Ultra we tested starts at $36,800, which, if memory serves, costs only about $5,000 more than a much smaller Lexus ES300, which offers far fewer features as well as a lot less room–and no StabiliTrak much less supercharged V-6.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning with driver/passenger zone settings; 16-inch, all-season radial tires; remote keyless entry; battery rundown protection; cruise control; power foldaway mirrors; AM/FM stereo radio with steering-wheel controls; rear-seat pass-through to the trunk; heated power memory seats; power windows with driver express down; moisture-sensing wipers; daytime running lamps; power door locks with delayed locking when you engage “Drive” and power lockout so they won’t engage if the key is left in the ignition; and retained accessory power.\n\n>> 2000 Buick Park Avenue Ultra Wheelbase: 113.8 inches Length: 206.8 inches Engine: 3.8-liter, 240-h.p., supercharged V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Fuel economy: 18 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway Base price: $36,800 Price as tested: $37,980. Includes $695 for chrome wheels, $200 for Gran Touring suspension, $185 for convenience console and $100 for radio upgrade to include CD and cassette and clock. Add $670 for freight. Pluses: StabiliTrak stability control system, traction control, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, front – and side-impact air bags, supercharged V-6, massive trunk, automatic level-control suspension and about a gazillion creature-comfort goodies for a most respectable price, especially versus Japanese and European competition. Minuses: “Convenience” console bigger than a suitcase. About time for more sensible exterior dimensions to make it more manageable, such as when parking or garaging. >>",

      "expert_review": "If you don’t know who Harley Earl is, if you weren’t aware that he changed the shape of the American car, General Motors Corp. is pleased to fill in the details.\n\nWho is Earl?\n\nHe’s GM’s pitchman on all those Buick ads. With a fedora and a pin-striped suit, Earl’s the guy who has been commissioned to revive a dying brand. The only problem is that Earl himself is dead. He died more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe irony is lost on no one.\n\nIf you are wondering why GM has turned to the past to liven up a brand that seems stuck in it, you might be onto something.\n\nNicknamed the “Da Vinci of Detroit,” Earl was a designer who was into progressive thinking. During three decades at GM, he changed the shape of the American car. He took the tall, boxy, disjointed rides of the early 1900s that were more function than form and turned them into works of art.\n\nBut would he have taken the 2003 Buick Park Avenue? We doubt it.\n\nEarl would tell the good folks at GM that with style, substance has to follow. That looks are only skin deep. And that as times change, sometimes mindsets have to be altered as well.\n\nWhile the exterior restyling on the new Park Avenue is attractive, it’s everything else that is living in another generation.\n\nIts ride is too mushy, its handling too loose and its price too high.\n\nSorry, Harley.\n\nSix years ago, when GM set out to redo the Park Avenue, the 1997 version of its flagship sedan came up a winner. Stacked up against the competition, it actually fared pretty well. But that was 1997. This is a new century.\n\nSix years later, the Audi A6 has muscled into the luxury sedan market along with the Lexus GS 300 – not to mention GM’s competitive cousins, the Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile Aurora and Pontiac Bonneville.\n\nWhere does the luxo-liner Park Avenue fit? That’s a big question.\n\nGM says those attracted to the Park Avenue are older customers who aren’t looking for the firmness of a European sports sedan. And in its most basic form, the Park Avenue is meant to do one thing well: Haul five people with a ride that resembles the top of a pillow. Check.\n\nThe only question: Is that worth $40,000? (Talk about a lot of goose feathers.)\n\nWhile it is big and comfy inside, our problem with the Park Avenue is that it is too much of a stroll – a cruiser that makes you think you’re ready to set sail.\n\nPack the Dramamine.\n\nWith a floaty ride that lumbers around corners, it’s tough to take the Park Avenue too seriously. On highways it performed well, but take it over city streets and each bruise or pothole in the road sends a shudder down its spine. Not what luxury riders want.\n\nBuick says this is an improved ride, mainly thanks to a specially tuned Gran Touring suspension and rear stabilizer bar. It left me looking for a 21st-century screwdriver (and left one of my passengers a little nause ous).\n\nThe 3.8-liter V-6 is steady enough. It puts out an impressive 205 horsepower in the base model, and when you opt for the Ultra’s supercharged version it bumps that number up to 240 horses and more torque – and, regrettably, more torque steer. Pound the pedal (which most Park Avenue buyers won’t) and the sedan jerks at the steering wheel.\n\nAesthetically, you can’t complain.\n\nThe Park Avenue arrives with an attractive design. There’s a new vertical-bar grille, side-mounted turn indicators, 17-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels and “portholes” on each side – three holes on each front fender meant to link the 2003 to 1949 and provide better air circulation under the hood. Inside, there is a ton of faux wood and new gauges.\n\nMostly, it is a classy look. And that satisfies one part of what the Park Avenue crowd is after, but not everything.\n\nBuick has always prided itself on quiet comfort, yet we found the Park Avenue surprisingly noisy, especially near the windows at highway speeds. But it is roomy. Five fit quite well in the cushiony interior. This is a big family car that can haul a family’s load of luggage – 19 cubic feet worth – and there’s even the option of a fold-down rear seat for lengthy objects. But don’t forget the 41-foot turning radius means a mall parking lot is a tricky place to be.\n\nOn safety, the Park Avenue has been awarded high marks in frontal and side-impact crash tests. There are standard seat-mounted side air bags for the front passengers – but no head-protective ones – and the Park Avenue also comes with GM’s StabiliTrak system. The brakes were excellent, providing solid stopping power for a vehicle that is on the hefty side at 2 tons.\n\nBut what’s also hefty is the price, something that was hard to look past.\n\nThe Park Avenue is no cheap cruise. It drives in at $39,600 for our test Ultra model. Add $2,470 in extras (sunroof, CD changer, heads-up display and rear parking assist) and you are up to $42,070 before GM incentives. Now that’s a load.\n\nEven with deep discounts, the Park Avenue feels like a ride that has seen better days. It looks better. It tries hard. But compared to what’s out there, it has a long way to go.\n\nSomething says Harley would understand.\n\n2003 Buick Park Avenue\n\nRating: 2\n\nHigh gear: Comfortable and roomy, the Park Avenue has always been a large sedan that can take you from Point A to Point B with a soft ride and plenty of cargo room. This year it also adds some interesting styling cues inside and out.\n\nLow gear: Even with a suspension that’s tuned with a better screwdriver, the Park Avenue floats along the road. It doesn’t eat bumps as well as it should, and it takes corners like a wagon would. Price also gets pretty steep with options.\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger luxury sedan.\n\nKey standard equipment (Ultra model): Four-speed automatic transmission; driver and front passenger frontal and side-impact air bags; OnStar communications system; anti-lock brakes; keyless entry; traction control; tilt, power steering; cruise control; dual-zone climate control; power windows, mirrors and locks; 10-way power leather seats; 17-inch alloy wheels; AM/FM/CD and cassette radio.\n\nKey competition: Audi A6, Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile Aurora, BMW 5-Series\n\nBase engine: 205 horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6\n\nTorque: 230 ft.-lbs. @ 4,000 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 113.8 inches\n\nLength: 206.8 inches\n\nMPG rating: 20 city/29 highway\n\nManufactured: Orion, Mich.\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles; drivetrain is three years/36,000 miles; roadside assistance is three years/36,000 miles; and rust is six years/100,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $39,600\n\nPrice as t ested (including options, destination and delivery): $41,865",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuick’s flagship sedan gets a monochromatic stand-up hood ornament for 2004. The Park Avenue’s interior features new cluster graphics, and fresh interior hues and woodgrains are now available. Restyled wheels will be offered midway through the 2004 model year.\n\nPortholes returned on the high-end Park Avenue Ultra in 2003. Called VentiPorts, the chrome-plated portholes on the side of each front fender first appeared on Buicks in 1949 and were last seen on the 1983 Electra.\n\nAs Buick puts it, the Park Avenue Ultra “draws from a rich design heritage to reveal a modern interpretation of a classic Buick.” A prominent vertical-bar grille was inspired by the automaker’s LaCrosse concept car, which integrates a chrome see-through tri-shield badge in its center.\n\nLower-profile tires on the Park Avenue Ultra are mounted on larger, 17-inch, chrome-aluminum wheels that promise better handling and a sportier ride. A standard Gran Touring Package includes a specially tuned suspension and rear stabilizer bar.\n\nBuick’s full-size, front-wheel-drive, near-luxury sedan is similar to the company’s LeSabre, but the supercharged Park Avenue Ultra comes with more standard features and a higher price tag. Buick also continues to offer a base-model Park Avenue with a nonsupercharged engine, 16-inch tires and fewer amenities.\n\nExterior\nEven though the Park Avenue is larger in dimensions, it has the same basic appearance as other Buick sedans. The Park Avenue rides a 113.8-inch wheelbase, and at 206.8 inches long overall, it stretches almost 7 inches longer than the lower-priced, family-oriented LeSabre.\n\nA monochromatic trishield badge is visible on the grille and trunk lid. Special chrome-plated exhaust tips are installed. Two new body colors will be available. Turn-signal indicators are incorporated into the side mirrors.\n\nInterior\nSeating for six occupants is standard in the roomy interior. The spacious trunk holds 19.1 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nAn optional convenience console for the Park Avenue Ultra creates a five-passenger environment. Bright aluminum sill plates with raised ridges line the floor at the front door openings. Leather upholstery and wood trim are standard. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard in the Ultra model and optional in the base trim level.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 240-horsepower, supercharged 3.8-liter V-6 engine goes into the Park Avenue Ultra, while the base Park Avenue uses a 205-hp nonsupercharged version of that engine. Both power plants team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nTraction control, antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard on the Park Avenue Ultra and comes in an option package for the base model.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven though the Park Avenue Ultra is a great road car, the ride isn’t quite as easygoing as some sedans in its class. Occupants may be knocked around a bit when the car is riding on rough pavement, but the top Buick model is well controlled on any surface. Smooth performance is a Park Avenue hallmark. Most buyers would probably be satisfied with the base model’s engine. The supercharged version in the Park Avenue Ultra adds extra zest, but its operation is subtle.",

      "expert_review": "About a hundred miles south of Los Angeles, cruising in the serenely competent comfort of a new Buick Park Avenue Ultra, I was seized by a minor midlife crisis.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve always touted cars that were long on agility and short on curb weight.\n\nYet there I was, feeling increasingly affectionate about this big two-ton sedan.\n\nWhat’s going on here? This isn’t a hard-edged driving weapon for attacking off-ramps or mountain switchbacks. This is a big ol’ American luxo cruiser.\n\nCould I be getting o…o…on in years?\n\nThe seizure was brief. Once I’d identified the source of the anxiety, it was easy to rationalize the neurotic notion that a Park Avenue Ultra is suitable only for those approaching their golden years.\n\nOK, the Ultra may not send out the right kind of lifestyle signals for folks who are thinking about a big BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Lexus.\n\nBut with the right equipment — specifically, the optional Gran Touring suspension package — the Park Avenue Ultra delivers surprising driver satisfaction, as well as the blue-chip virtues you’d expect of a Buick: smooth ride, living room interior space, luxury appointments and quiet operation.\n\nOf course, satisfying isn’t quite the same as stimulating, and the closest you’ll get to the realm of adrenaline is when you tramp on the gas and the supercharged 3800 V6 hauls all this refined mass — about 250 pounds heavier than the previous Park Avenue Ultra — to 60 m.p.h. in less than 8 seconds.\n\nMore important, the 3800’s tugboat torque provides lots of punch for passing maneuvers, say from 30 on up to 75 m.p.h.\n\nAnd for folks who don’t feel a need to re-establish their reputations as hot drivers every time a Mustang or Camaro pulls up in the next lane, 240 horsepower and 280 foot-pounds of torque do the job just fine, thanks.\n\nBeyond that, the supercharged 3800 V6 goes about its business smoothly, quietly, and with surprising efficiency. In I-5 cruising, my tester turned in a steady 26 m.p.g., and its all-around average rang up at 23 m.p.g.\n\nThe only downside of the supercharged version versus the non-supercharged 3800 in the standard Park Avenue is at the pump. The non-supercharged edition runs on unleaded regular, while the supercharged requires premium.\n\nAs noted, this is a big car — bigger and heavier than its predecessor, particularly in the vertical dimension.\n\nAt 57.4 inches, the new Park Avenue is more than two inches taller than the old one, making it the tallest of the current Buick tribe.\n\nFor comparison, the Chrysler LHS and Lincoln Continental, key Park Avenue Ultra competitors, stand 55.9 inches.\n\nWhy’d they do that? Two reasons.\n\nReason No. 1: In the evolving mission of Buick, comfort takes precedence over style.\n\nNo. 2: With the old rear-drive Roadmaster consigned to history, the Park Avenue is now the grand dame of the Buick fleet.\n\nIn the Park Avenue, the two key comfort elements in the design scheme were interior roominess — including top-hat headroom fore and aft — and door openings that eliminate any contortions in getting in or out.\n\nThe finished product gets top marks on both counts.\n\nInterior space is vast, a word that also applies to the trunk. And getting in and out is devoid of the duck-and-bend move required in some swoopier designs — the Olds Aurora, for example — even though the door sill is a trifle higher than in the previous Park Avenue.\n\nYou probably could say the same things about certain minivans. But the real achievement in the new Park Avenue is that it embodies these virtues in a shape that’s also graceful and quietly elegant.\n\nIt doesn’t turn heads like the Aurora. In fact, I found it to be well-nigh invisible in the southern California traffic mix.\n\nBut it does have a strong touch of the “muscular grace” that Buick designers want their cars to project.\n\nA smooth, quiet r e\n\nFor all its roominess, the biggest improvement in this car is something you can’t see.\n\nAlthough the ’97 Park Avenue looks like an evolutionary update on the previous car, it’s all new, with underpinnings based on the Riviera-Aurora chassis.\n\nWith the exception of curb weight, this is a good thing.\n\nThe Aurora-Riv chassis, or platform, is one of the stiffest in the entire GM warehouse.\n\nThe stiffer the foundation, the easier it is for the suspension engineers to create the desired ride and handling traits.\n\nIt also makes it easier to keep noise out of the car, and pays long-term durability benefits.\n\nGiven this start, it was interesting to experience the dynamic distinctions between the basic Park Avenue and the flagship Ultra.\n\nThe ride and handling of the standard Park Avenue are all but indistinguishable from its predecessors.\n\nThis is essentially the same setup — they call it Dynaride — that’s earned big Buick sedans such a geriatric image over the years: excessively soft ride, lots of body roll in hard cornering and vague power steering, particularly when the steering wheel is at or near dead center.\n\nCompared to the standard car, a Park Avenue with the firmer Gran Touring suspension package delivers responses that feel much more closely related to the Riviera.\n\nThe Ultra’s magnetic power rack and pinion steering system, which is different from the basic Park Avenue, varies the amount of power assist as vehicle speed and/or steering wheel angles increase, providing a significantly better sense of where the front wheels are pointed in the process.\n\nIt’s also dealer programmable, which means you can tailor the level of steering effort to suit your tastes and driving style.\n\nMore important, the Gran Touring suspension package yields significantly sharper responses in quick maneuvers.\n\nIt’s not quite as firm as the Riv, and there’s always a sense of plenty of mass moving back and forth, but it’s far from flabby and the trade-off in ride quality is minor.\n\nAll in all, with the Gran Touring package the Ultra’s combination of enhanced control and slightly firmer ride lends a contemporary feel to this car’s dynamics that’s a pleasant step forward for Buick.\n\nInterior comfort\n\nLike the exterior and the underpinnings, the interior styling rates as more contemporary.\n\nBuick managed to break out of the old horizontal dashboard that afflicted the old Park Avenue, installing a modestly curved cowl over the main instruments, which in turn allowed the design team to increase the size of the tachometer and speedometer.\n\nAnother welcome change is the general appearance of the dashboard, which shows a strong Riviera influence with its sharp contrasts between secondary controls and the interior color schemes.\n\nInevitably, there’s more wood grain, but the overall look is clean and distinctive, and the wood is the real article.\n\nBeyond that, the sound system buttons and climate controls are close copies of the Riv, which means they’re bigger, better located and far easier to operate when the car is moving.\n\nAs you’d expect, the Park Avenue Ultra includes a full array of luxury goodies — premium sound system, automatic climate control, leather, power everything — that make the going more pleasant. Check the specs.\n\nFor that matter, so does the standard Park Avenue.\n\nA basic Park Avenue starts at $30,660, including destination charges — roughly the same as a Chrysler LHS.\n\nThe Park Avenue Ultra starts at $35,660 — about a grand less than a Lincoln Continental and very close to the Aurora, which can be viewed as competition whether GM brand managers like it or not.\n\nAlthough the LHS and Continental are headed for change in ’98 — big change, in the case of the Chrysler — I’d say the Park Avenue stacks up very well against its short list of direct competitors.\n\nSure t’s sedate, and it’s probably not going to satisfy anyone who’s in the market for a sport sedan. But there’s a lot to like here: excellent road manners, subdued good looks, class-leading roominess and lots of luxury features.\n\nIf comfort, competence and quality are your priorities — and you’re not worried about midlife crisis — here’s a big Buick that’s very much in step with the late 20th Century. Just make sure you order the Gran Touring package.\n\nRATING: 3 wheels\n\nVEHICLE TYPE: Front engine, front-drive, full-size sedan\n\nKEY COMPETITORS: Chrysler LHS, Lincoln Continental, Oldsmobile Aurora\n\nBASE PRICE: $35,660\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $36,105\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT: ABS, dual air bags, traction control, 4-speed automatic transmission, keyless remote entry, AM/FM/CD audio, steering wheel audio controls, trip computer, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, power adjustable headrests, leather seats, heated power front seats, tilt steering, universal transmitter, aluminum alloy wheels, low tire pressure warning\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n(manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine 240-hp 3.8-liter supercharged V6\n\nEPA fuel econ. 18 city/27 hwy.\n\nCurb weight 3,879 pounds\n\nWheelbase 113.8 inches\n\nLength 206.8 inches\n\nWidth 74.7 inches\n\nHeight 57.4 inches\n\nWhere assembled Orion",

      "expert_review": "The Park Avenue Ultra is Buick’s flagship, a supercharged luxury sedan targeted at offerings from Lincoln, Cadillac and the imports. It offers gobs of space, plush seats and vigorous performance.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Park Avenue line was completely new in 1998, so changes for 1999 consist of minor revisions to the tail lamps and the addition of four new colors. Pricing ranges from $31,800 for the Park Avenue to $36,695 for the Park Avenue Ultra.\n\nThe key difference between the two can be found under the hood. Both use General Motors’ 3.8-liter, 3800 Series II V6, but the one in the Ultra is supercharged and puts out 240 horsepower. The non-supercharged model has 205 horsepower.\n\nOur Park Avenue Ultra, from Buick’s press fleet, had a hefty sticker price of more than $37,000.\n\nThe supercharged engine pounds out power like a small V8, it produces traces of coarseness that send a tingle through the steering wheel as you step into the throttle from idle. Things smooth out quickly as speed increases. The non-supercharged engine is smoother, not to mention less thirsty, and its performance is more than adequate in most driving conditions.\n\nVisually, distinguishing the Ultra from the regular Park Avenue is also tough. The clean, yet conservative styling not only perpetuates the Park Avenue persona but also fits in nicely with the rest of the Buick family.\n\nA long list of standard equipment really sets the Ultra apart. Leather, heated seats with memory settings, wood trim, steering wheel controls for radio and temperature and full-range traction control are among the key distinctions. The Ultra also has a standard CD player.\n\nBuick chose to base this generation Park Avenue on a platform derived from that of the Oldsmobile Aurora. It has 113.8-inch wheelbase and structural integrity and stiffness that resists flexing and reduces the number of squeaks and rattles.\n\nA stiff chassis gives engineers a chance to tune the suspension for a compliant ride without sacrificing responsiveness. The Ultra rides with a firmness that reflects the ability to take turns and lane changes without wallowing.\n\nParadoxically, I found the suspension felt less confident on highways with undulating pavement. A Gran Touring suspension package is available. Seats have long been a Park Avenue trademark, and those in the Ultra were no exception. The padding was firm, for excellent support, yet the seats were contoured to fit a wide variety of body types.\n\nWhite-on-black gauges dot the instrument panel, which was accented with a highly polished strip of wood. Auxiliary controls for radio and temperature control are built into the steering wheel. When the gear lever was in Drive, it obscured the switch for the drivers seat heater.\n\nThe Ultra also has a standard Driver Information Center that calculates fuel economy, useful oil life, coolant level and tire pressure.\n\nThe test car was equipped with Eye Cu e, a head-up display that projects a small digital speed readout on the windshield so it appears to be floating out at the end of the hood.\n\nA notable option is a big center console whose top flips forward to reveal two large cupholders and a place for a cellular phone. The lid to the middle storage compartment has a writing surface and place for a notpad on its underside. Called the Convenience Console, this $185 option is especially appealing to folks who use their cars as mobile offices. One drawback, however minor, is that it prohibits three people from riding in the front seat.\n\nAs you would expect of a car with a 206.8-inch overall length, the trunk capacity is 19.1 cubic feet.\n\nPrice: The base price of our test car was $36,695, including freight. Optional equipment consisted of the Eye Cue head-up display and the Convenience Console. The sticker price was $37,255.\n\nWarranty: Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Great sea , room for five and a big trunk are among the strengths of the Park Avenue Ultra. A supercharged V6 gives it V8 performance.\n\nCounterpoint: The supercharger accounts for tingles of low-speed vibration and the suspension seemed surprisingly soft over highway undulations.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 3.8-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive\nWHEELBASE: 113.8 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,884 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $36,695\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $37,255\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Buick is walking a tightrope these days.\n\nArguably the most successful builder of traditional American sedans, the General Motors division is busily reinventing itself to attract a new generation of drivers while trying to avoid alienating its large contingent of loyal owners.\n\nBuick’s flagship, the newly revamped Park Avenue, is a perfect case in point. A heavy cruiser of classic proportions, the Park Avenue has to fill the gap left by the rear-wheel-drive Roadmaster, which was axed this year along with GM’s other full-size rear-drivers.\n\nBut it also has to appeal to younger people, accustomed to cars that are sporty and fun to drive.\n\nAs a bona fide member of Buick’s next-generation target group, I started out way less than excited at the prospect of driving a Park Avenue. Its name evokes some kind of geriatric plushmobile, with its phony allure of wealthy New Yorkers residing near Central Park.\n\nAnd it arrived in an overly conservative shade of maroon with the pretentious name of Bordeaux red pearl, and matching maroon interior. Boring!\n\nBut the top-of-the-line Park Avenue Ultra did hold out some promise, with its powerful supercharged engine, tightened suspension and other performance tweaks. So with mixed feelings, I took the wheel.\n\nThe first notion is that the Park Avenue has, as expected, a very quiet, comfortable ride. The bench seats are supportive, and all controls and gauges are simple, straightforward and logically arranged.\n\nGradually, it began sinking in that the Ultra is quite a sophisticated automobile, a no-nonsense car that does everything well.\n\nThere’s an overall feeling of quality and competence about the Park Avenue. Squeaks, rattles and road noise are absent, thanks in part to a stiff platform inherited from the Riviera.Charging along the rough-concrete sections of the Black Canyon Freeway, tire rumble and other noises are distant and unobtrusive.\n\nThe V-6 engine ticks away silently under the hood, exceptionally refined for a six-cylinder pushrod engine. The fun starts when you hit the throttle. With a distant growl, the 240 horses accelerate the heavy sedan with a strong, seamless pull, dialing in some muscle-car appeal to go with the class act.\n\nThe supercharging system, in which a belt-driven pump forces air into the engine cylinders to boost horsepower and torque, may seem overly complex to some drivers. If so, the standard-issue Park Avenue has a naturally aspirated V-6 that delivers a not-too-shabby 205 horsepower.\n\nThe shifting of the automatic transmission is flawless, never harsh or jarring and nearly always in the right gear at the right time.\n\nThe Park Avenue’s excellent driveability was a pleasant surprise. The handling is very good, with balanced cornering and minimal body sway.\n\nThe good steering system also was appreciated. I expected the same kind of numb, overly light steering that I’ve experienced in any number of luxury cars from Detroit and Japan. But the thick , leather-wrapped steering wheel felt firm and responsive, again showing the quality of GM’s “magna-steer” rack-and-pinion system.\n\nInterior space is very roomy in every dimension, as befitting its big-car role. The dashboard and door panels are pretty staid, but it’s not a bad trade-off for the high level of comfort.The stereo system is superb.\n\nThe exterior styling grew on me, its rounded forms accented by sharp creases on the hood and rear, a definite nod toward the acclaimed styling of the Riviera. I’d skip the Bordeaux red pearl, though, and go for a sharper look in black (like the one pictured), silver or a deep blue.\n\nThe Park Avenue is not cheap, but compared with Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti, BMW, Mercedes and other luxury liners, the Buick seems like a lot of car for the money.\n\nWill a reborn Buick pull drivers out of their BMWs? I doubt it. But it should put up a fight for those looking for decent family transport that won’t bore them to tears.\n\n1997 Buick Park Avenue\n\nVehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.
