      "expert_review": "The all-new 2012 Buick Verano is as new and youthful as it gets for this brand trying to shake off the image of an automaker that caters to grandparents. The Verano’s driving mannerisms are neither squishy nor floaty, and I never once left the blinker on too long during my test drive.\n\nThe 2012 Verano isn’t a land yacht laden with a velour-tufted front bench seat; it’s a compact sedan that’s a posh everyday car bent on making the driver comfortable, which is something it excels at.\n\nWith its 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, the Verano was easy to drive and maneuver around small parking lots. Take note, it’s not a performance car. If you’re looking for more zip from the Verano, Buick will offer a Verano Turbo for 2013. Available at dealerships in late 2012, it’ll have a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.\n\nBecause of its compact size — it’s based on the Chevrolet Cruze — it’s also not the best family hauler, and it’s not the sportiest. But it is an affordable luxury car that’s quite pretty and quiet as a mouse.\n\nThe 2012 Verano base trim has a starting price of $23,470 (including an $885 destination charge). My top-trim test car, which had leather seating, rang up at $26,850.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Verano has a sporty look, but it doesn’t completely abandon its Buick heritage. The sedan has eye-catching chrome accents and a waterfall grille that’s found across the Buick lineup.\n\nAs you may expect, it’s easy for kids to get in and out of the Verano. The doors pulls are lightweight, and the step-in height is a piece of cake for kids. However, the sloped rear doors will surely cause parents to hit their heads when getting smaller kids in and out of child-safety seats. This isn’t atypical for sedans but is worth mentioning if you’re looking for a vehicle that’ll be easy on your head and back.\n\nThe five-seater’s trunk is surprisingly large for a compact sedan. It can easily handle a week’s worth of groceries, though a trip to a membership warehouse might require you to fold the 60/40-split rear seats. A single stroller will easily fit into the trunk, but a double stroller might be too big.\n\nThe 2012 Verano has a 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 21/32 mpg city/highway and uses regular gas. It also uses E85 ethanol, but its fuel-economy numbers drop to 15/23 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some-Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nOnce inside the Verano, I was a happy camper. It has so many features that it was fun to just sit and play with them. And play I did.\n\nIn the front seat, there are two cupholders and a deep bin behind the gearshift that easily held a water bottle. I liked the Cashmere-colored leather seats with the dark brown floor and bottom of the dash. The top of the dash matched the seat color. The faux-wood trim added a luxurious touch, as did the brushed metal accents and chrome-rimmed gauges on the instrument cluster. With its heated driver and front passenger seats, heated steering wheel, power driver’s seat, sunroof and remote start, I felt pampered in this car.\n\nNot everything was perfect in the interior. The center stack seems to be composed of nothing but buttons, and there are more buttons on the touch-screen for the IntelliLink multimedia system. Thankfully, they’re all clearly labeled.\n\nIn the backseat, the kids were comfortable. There are two cupholders in the fold-down armrest and two seatback pockets. The bench was bolstered but not so much so that there were serious child-safety-seat fit issues. Taller people might be a little cramped in the second row, so keep that in mind if you’re driving around tall teens.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Buick Verano has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this safety nod, a car must get the highest score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The federal government hasn’t crash-tested the Verano.\n\nThis sedan fits kids in forward-facing car seats pretty well, but rear-facing seats require some compromised legroom for front-row occupants. The two sets of lower Latch anchors are easy to locate, but they’re tightly wedged between the seat cushions. Patience will be required with installation — that’s for sure. Find out how the 2012 Verano performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Verano has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, 10 airbags, including side-impact airbags for the second row and side curtains for all rows. Rear parking sensors are standard on all trims but the base level. The Verano comes with a free six-month subscription to OnStar.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Buick Verano here.",

      "expert_review": "A few drawbacks tarnish the turbo 2013 Buick Verano, which is an otherwise refined sedan with sleeper performance if you rev it out.\n\nA year after its introduction, the Buick Verano gained an optional turbocharged four-cylinder from Buick’s larger Regal. Think of it as a sophomore-year hand-me-down — and one that any car should want. It gives the little Verano unexpected high-revving muscle. Unfortunately, its report card also has some blemishes, which I’ll detail further on.\n\nSee my review of last year’s Verano for a broader overview of the car and its normally aspirated four-cylinder. The turbo comes on the highest of four available trim levels — the Verano Premium, which Buick added for 2013 and which we tested (see the window sticker here). You can also get the Verano in base, Convenience and Leather editions. Compare them here, or compare the 2013 and 2012 Verano here.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nWith its normally aspirated, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic, the Verano has adequate passing power. The turbocharged four-cylinder turns the car into a smooth-revving sleeper. It’s one of the quickest Buicks I’ve ever driven — a list, alas, that does not include the famed GNX of the late 1980s. But the Verano turbo holds its own. The 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder launches with some turbo lag, but past 2,700 rpm or so it hurtles the Verano toward redline. You don’t feel it coming — and you certainly don’t hear it. The drivetrain is whisper-silent at low speeds, with a muted whooshing as the turbo comes alive a few moments after you mash the pedal.\n\nThe competing 2.4-liter Acura ILX launches with more immediacy, but the Verano flies ahead once it shakes off the low-rpm lag. Indeed, various enthusiast publications have gotten the stick-shift Buick to hit 60 mph in the 6.5-second range.\n\nAbout that stick shift: It’s a no-charge option over the six-speed automatic, but editors agreed it’s a disappointment, with muddier throws than the better stick in Buick’s Regal GS. It clunks into 1st gear or Reverse, both far to the left, with stubborn resistance. Going from 2nd to 3rd is a long throw, and the gearing works against you during hard on-ramp charges. First and 2nd are short, but then you land in an abruptly tall 3rd. By 5th gear you’ve been dumped into lope-along highway rpm. At least there’s prodigious-enough torque — 260 pounds-feet at just 2,000 rpm — to muscle ahead. But try to downshift and the drivetrain’s accelerator lag hampers any efforts to rev-match. I love manual transmissions as much as the next car guy, but the automatic might be a better choice in the Verano.\n\nRide & Handling\nWith the same 18-inch wheels and P235/45R18 tires, the Verano maintains a settled ride that follows in the Buick tradition. Editors were split on steering feel. Some found it spot on — light at low speeds, sharp in the curves — but others found it sloppy. The car still tends toward understeer, but it feels less nose-heavy than the 2.4-liter Verano. Still, quick changes in direction produce noticeable body roll, and the low-tech semi-independent rear suspension, along with our tester’s Continental ContiProContact all-season tires, made for plenty of skittishness over bumps. Don’t relish those cloverleafs too much; a midcorner expansion joint will have the Verano dancing about.\n\nThose same tires kick up a low rumble on the interstate, but overall cabin noise is low. Come to a stop, and the all-disc antilock brakes have linear pedal feel.\n\nThe Inside\nSee my review of the Verano for an overall take on cabin quality. Materials remain competitive with the entry-luxury class, but crowded center controls, a tight backseat and sight-line-robbing window pillars remain downsides. Buick’s standard IntelliLink system is fairly robust; it has a 7-inch dashboard screen with Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus USB and auxiliary jacks. Internet radio providers Pandora and Stitcher can also stream off your smartphone via a corresponding IntelliLink app. Unfortunately, editors found the Verano’s optional Bose stereo (included in our test car) unimpressive.\n\nOur car had keyless access and push-button start, with unlock buttons on the front and rear doors. It’s convenient — many luxury cars include just the former — but there’s no trunk-mounted release. You have to fish the key fob out of your pocket or purse to unlock the thing, which defeats the purpose.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nTop crash-test results by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety made the Verano an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Like most cars, however, it has not undergone IIHS’ new small-overlap frontal test. Standard safety features include 10 airbags, all-disc antilock brakes and the required electronic stability system. New for 2013, a blind spot warning system is optional.\n\nLike its Chevrolet Cruze sibling, the Verano has had abysmal reliability in its first year. The Cruze improved in its second year — 2012 — so here’s hoping the Verano does the same. Until that’s evidenced, however, exercise caution.\n\nThe Verano starts around $24,000 including destination charge. Standard features include Buick’s IntelliLink system, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls, cloth-and-leatherette (imitation leather) seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. Full leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a power driver’s seat, a navigation system and a moonroof are optional. The turbocharged four-cylinder comes only on the Verano Premium Group, which starts around $30,000. Check all the factory options, and the Verano tops out just more than $33,000. Even at that price, strangely, a power passenger seat isn’t available.\n\nVerano Turbo in the Market\nBuick needs to right its reliability ship, and turbo shoppers can probably skip the manual. But the Verano is off to a strong start, outselling all other Buick sedans in the first month of 2013. The turbo adds some bite without compromising the car’s refinement. Given the influx of so-called “entry-luxury” cars — the latest attempt to attract more buyers to the upscale ranks — the Verano should see increasing interest.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2013 about the 2013 Buick Verano. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA few drawbacks tarnish the turbo 2013 Buick Verano, which is an otherwise refined sedan with sleeper performance if you rev it out.\n\nA year after its introduction, the Buick Verano gained an optional turbocharged four-cylinder from Buick’s larger Regal. Think of it as a sophomore-year hand-me-down — and one that any car should want. It gives the little Verano unexpected high-revving muscle. Unfortunately, its report card also has some blemishes, which I’ll detail further on.\n\nSee my review of last year’s Verano for a broader overview of the car and its normally aspirated four-cylinder. The turbo comes on the highest of four available trim levels — the Verano Premium, which Buick added for 2013 and which we tested (see the window sticker here). You can also get the Verano in base, Convenience and Leather editions. Compare them here, or compare the 2013 and 2012 Verano here.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nWith its normally aspirated, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic, the Verano has adequate passing power. The turbocharged four-cylinder turns the car into a smooth-revving sleeper. It’s one of the quickest Buicks I’ve ever driven — a list, alas, that does not include the famed GNX of the late 1980s. But the Verano turbo holds its own. The 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder launches with some turbo lag, but past 2,700 rpm or so it hurtles the Verano toward redline. You don’t feel it coming — and you certainly don’t hear it. The drivetrain is whisper-silent at low speeds, with a muted whooshing as the turbo comes alive a few moments after you mash the pedal.\n\nThe competing 2.4-liter Acura ILX launches with more immediacy, but the Verano flies ahead once it shakes off the low-rpm lag. Indeed, various enthusiast publications have gotten the stick-shift Buick to hit 60 mph in the 6.5-second range.\n\nAbout that stick shift: It’s a no-charge option over the six-speed automatic, but editors agreed it’s a disappointment, with muddier throws than the better stick in Buick’s Regal GS. It clunks into 1st gear or Reverse, both far to the left, with stubborn resistance. Going from 2nd to 3rd is a long throw, and the gearing works against you during hard on-ramp charges. First and 2nd are short, but then you land in an abruptly tall 3rd. By 5th gear you’ve been dumped into lope-along highway rpm. At least there’s prodigious-enough torque — 260 pounds-feet at just 2,000 rpm — to muscle ahead. But try to downshift and the drivetrain’s accelerator lag hampers any efforts to rev-match. I love manual transmissions as much as the next car guy, but the automatic might be a better choice in the Verano.\n\nRide & Handling\nWith the same 18-inch wheels and P235/45R18 tires, the Verano maintains a settled ride that follows in the Buick tradition. Editors were split on steering feel. Some found it spot on — light at low speeds, sharp in the curves — but others found it sloppy. The car still tends toward understeer, but it feels less nose-heavy than the 2.4-liter Verano. Still, quick changes in direction produce noticeable body roll, and the low-tech semi-independent rear suspension, along with our tester’s Continental ContiProContact all-season tires, made for plenty of skittishness over bumps. Don’t relish those cloverleafs too much; a midcorner expansion joint will have the Verano dancing about.\n\nThose same tires kick up a low rumble on the interstate, but overall cabin noise is low. Come to a stop, and the all-disc antilock brakes have linear pedal feel.\n\nThe Inside\nSee my review of the Verano for an overall take on cabin quality. Materials remain competitive with the entry-luxury class, but crowded center controls, a tight backseat and sight-line-robbing window pillars remain downsides. Buick’s standard IntelliLink system is fairly robust; it has a 7-inch dashboard screen with Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, plus USB and auxiliary jacks. Internet radio providers Pandora and Stitcher can also stream off your smartphone via a corresponding IntelliLink app. Unfortunately, editors found the Verano’s optional Bose stereo (included in our test car) unimpressive.\n\nOur car had keyless access and push-button start, with unlock buttons on the front and rear doors. It’s convenient — many luxury cars include just the former — but there’s no trunk-mounted release. You have to fish the key fob out of your pocket or purse to unlock the thing, which defeats the purpose.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nTop crash-test results by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety made the Verano an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Like most cars, however, it has not undergone IIHS’ new small-overlap frontal test. Standard safety features include 10 airbags, all-disc antilock brakes and the required electronic stability system. New for 2013, a blind spot warning system is optional.\n\nLike its Chevrolet Cruze sibling, the Verano has had abysmal reliability in its first year. The Cruze improved in its second year — 2012 — so here’s hoping the Verano does the same. Until that’s evidenced, however, exercise caution.\n\nThe Verano starts around $24,000 including destination charge. Standard features include Buick’s IntelliLink system, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls, cloth-and-leatherette (imitation leather) seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. Full leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a power driver’s seat, a navigation system and a moonroof are optional. The turbocharged four-cylinder comes only on the Verano Premium Group, which starts around $30,000. Check all the factory options, and the Verano tops out just more than $33,000. Even at that price, strangely, a power passenger seat isn’t available.\n\nVerano Turbo in the Market\nBuick needs to right its reliability ship, and turbo shoppers can probably skip the manual. But the Verano is off to a strong start, outselling all other Buick sedans in the first month of 2013. The turbo adds some bite without compromising the car’s refinement. Given the influx of so-called “entry-luxury” cars — the latest attempt to attract more buyers to the upscale ranks — the Verano should see increasing interest.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
