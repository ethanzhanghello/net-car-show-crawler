      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuick joined the minivan market for 2005 with the Terraza, which features sliding side doors and a low step-in height.\n\nTwo versions are offered: the base CX and uplevel CXL. For 2007, the 3.9-liter V-6 with variable valve timing is the standard engine, while the all-wheel drive and independent rear suspension options have been discontinued. A flex-fuel model, compatible with gasoline, E85 or a combination of the two, will be available later in the model year.\n\nThe 2007 Terraza comes with redesigned 17-inch eight-spoke aluminum wheels and is available in three new exterior colors: Light Quartz Metallic, Polar Blue Metallic and Gold Mist Metallic. Traction control, an electronic stability system and General Motors’ OnStar Turn-by-Turn navigation system now come standard on all models.\n\nExterior\nSport utility vehicle-like styling features of the Terraza include its closer-to-vertical squared-off front fascia and its tall hood. Prominent C-pillars and 17-inch wheels are also supposed to bring SUVs to mind. Gently sculpted forms, on the other hand, are strictly Buick in nature. The Terraza’s familiar grille is a variant on the traditional Buick design. Vertical bars and a chrome surround are meant to reflect Buick’s Centieme concept vehicle.\n\nThe Terraza’s exterior is highlighted by bright chrome accents on the door handles, among other places, and “Buick” is embossed into the bright-finished rear license plate brow. Built on a 121.1-inch wheelbase, the Terraza is 205 inches long overall and 72 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nSeven occupants fit inside the Terraza. The seats have contrasting-colored piping, and leather trim is available. The third row features a removable 50/50-split, folding bench seat. An available power bucket seat operates via remote control and rotates, extends and lowers out of the vehicle to assist entry and exit for the disabled.\n\nThe three-spoke steering wheel has leather accents. Woodgrain is used on the instrument panel. A woodgrain-trimmed gearshift knob is used in the CXL. Cargo volume is 74.1 cubic feet with the rear seat folded and 26.9 cubic feet with all the seats up. An overhead console and rail system are standard, as is a DVD-based rear entertainment system.\n\nAn available PhatNoise media system offers a variety of multimedia capabilities, including MP3 and MPEG storage and playback. Other options include XM Satellite Radio and a rear DVD player with auxiliary video and audio inputs. The available “tri-mode” entertainment system allows occupants to listen to DVDs, CDs and the radio simultaneously through the speakers and dual-channel wireless headphones.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe now-standard 3.9-liter V-6 features variable valve timing, develops 240 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of torque, and drives a four-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Terraza can tow a 3,500-pound trailer.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard on all Terrazas, and side-impact airbags for the first and second rows are optional on the CX and standard on the CXL.",

      "expert_review": "According to Buick, “the all-new Terraza crossover sport van brings a rich blend of style, comfort and elegance to the premium mid-van segment.” Style, comfort and elegance: Perfect! I’m missing all three of those.\n\nMy life is better described as dirty (nobody told me that having children forfeits my right to a daily shower), exhausted (I don’t remember the last time I read more than a paragraph at night before falling asleep), and sticky (how do my children manage to cover nearly every household surface in yogurt?).\n\nStyle? Elegance? Did the people at Buick actually see this car before writing that? My experience in the 2005 Buick Terraza CXL is quite different. My first impression is that the exterior of the vehicle looks like a really old Dodge Caravan. The metal trim piece on the side is very dated looking. I’m still trying to figure out who came up with the term “crossover sport van.” There’s nothing sporty about it.\n\nClimbing into to car has me wondering: Is this car actually new? Nothing about it seems modern. The interior is dominated by icky brown plastic, with the exception of the leather seats. The butter soft leather trimmed with contrasted piping is oddly out of place.\n\nBuick has a reputation of being popular amongst the more mature segment of our population, something that Buick is attempting to change with the addition of the ever popular (and young) Tiger Woods as a spokesperson. I’m curious, what does Tiger’s fiancee; drive? I’d be willing to bet that it’s not a Terraza.\n\nIt’s no secret that I don’t like how this “sport van” looks. But how does it function?\n\nThe automatic sliding doors win my kids over immediately. They also like the folding tray table with cupholders between the second row captains chairs – a feature also seen between the front two seats. Folding the trays down makes it easy to move about in the vehicle.\n\nOpening the cargo door to load my stroller and other necessary mom and kid equipment leaves me in pain. The cargo door latch pinches my fingers each and every time I use it.\n\nI do love the level cargo floor (as opposed to the sunken ones found in most minivans). It makes a great platform for changing diapers when the need arises. The level floor lifts up in two sections to reveal a clever series of underfloor storage bins (perfect for storing an emergency diaper changing kit).\n\nWhen additional cargo space is necessary, the seats fold flat simply (although the head restraints must first be removed).\n\nDriving the 2005 Buick Terraza CXL gives me a whole slough of other complaints. The driver’s seatbelt is attached too high up on the door jam, causing some rubbing on my neck, despite adjusting it to its lowest position and raising the seat up; the lack of power is frustrating (even to me – and I normally couldn’t care less about power) and the noisy cabin is, well, noisy, making it hard to hold a conversation with my children in the back.\n\nModern moms demand form and function in their cars today. The 2005 Buick Terraza has some function but no form. I’m sorry to say it, but despite its nifty “crossover sports van” title, it just can’t compete with other more innovative and style conscious minivans on the market today.\n\n*For more information on the Buick Terraza and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuick joined the minivan market for 2005 with the Terraza, which features sliding side doors and a low step-in height. For 2006, the Terraza can be equipped with a new 3.9-liter V-6.\n\nTwo versions are offered: the base CX and uplevel CXL. Both models are available with either front- or all-wheel drive. A 3.5-liter V-6 is standard, but the new 3.9-liter V-6 can be installed in front-wheel-drive Terrazas. The Terraza’s warranty has been lengthened for the 2006 model year.\n\nExterior\nSport utility vehicle-like styling features of the Terraza include its closer-to-vertical squared-off front fascia and its tall hood. Prominent C-pillars and 17-inch wheels are also supposed to bring SUVs to mind. Gently sculpted forms, on the other hand, are strictly Buick in nature. The Terraza’s familiar grille is a variant on the traditional Buick design. Vertical bars and a chrome surround are meant to reflect Buick’s Centieme concept vehicle.\n\nThe Terraza’s exterior is highlighted by bright chrome accents on the door handles, among other places, and “Buick” is embossed into the bright-finished rear license plate brow. Built on a 121.1-inch wheelbase, the Terraza is 204.7 inches long overall and 69.4 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nSeven occupants fit inside the Terraza. The seats have contrasting-colored piping. The CX’s seats have cloth inserts with leather bolsters in the first two rows, and the CXL gets leather seats. The third row features a 50/50-split, folding bench seat. Both the second- and third-row seats can be removed.\n\nThe three-spoke steering wheel has leather accents. Woodgrain is used on the instrument panel. A woodgrain-trimmed gearshift knob is used in the CXL.\n\nAn overhead console and rail system are standard, as is a DVD-based rear entertainment system. Cargo volume is 74.1 cubic feet with the rear seat folded and 26.9 cubic feet with all the seats up.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.5-liter V-6 produces 201 horsepower in front-wheel-drive Terrazas, and 196 hp in all-wheel-drive models. The new 3.9-liter V-6 features variable valve timing and develops 240 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines drive a four-speed-automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Terraza can tow a 3,500-pound trailer.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard on all Terrazas. Front-wheel-drive models get standard traction control and General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system. Side-impact airbags for the first and second rows are optional on the CX and standard on the CXL. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard on all Terrazas.",
