      "expert_review": "Used to be that you knew it was time to buy a Buick when your physician put you on a soft-food diet.\n\nBuicks were ugly, but they were big. Styling was immaterial, because most owners wore bifocals, anyway. Besides, most owners didn`t care what the car looked like as long as it weighed 6,000 pounds and offered them lots of protection when they accidentally bumped into other cars in the lots on senior citizens` outings.\n\nThere were two reasons Buick catered to the same crowd as AARP: The cars were so expensive you had to save for 65 years to afford one, and, equally important, the car division was run by general managers who were but a step from Medicare themselves. The young guys ran Chevrolet and Pontiac, the geriatrics ran Oldsmobile and Buick.\n\nA Buick still is expensive. You might not have to save 65 years to afford one, but the average Joe or Jane on the street would have to allow 60 months to pay for one. The high cost still keeps a Buick out of the hands of the middle class, which is in keeping with GM`s philosophy of starting blue-collar workers out in a Chevy and letting them move up to a Buick when they earn enough to sport a white collar.\n\nBuick now is run by a gentleman named Ed Mertz, whose claim to fame is that he was only 49 when he became the division`s general manager and turned 55 only last week-barely the age of puberty in the traditional Buick sense.\n\nWhat Mertz has meant to Buick is measurable in terms of increased sales and, more importantly, increased quality. Perhaps GM management erred in naming the relatively young Mertz to run Buick in 1986 because he was a graduate of Norte Dame, and therefore a Golden Domer. Someone must have thought that referred to his age, not his school, and let the youth slip into the prestigious spot by mistake.\n\nWhatever, Buick never has had it so good, and neither have consumers, since Mertz took over.\n\nWe`ve had the opportunity to test drivea pair of Buicks, the LeSabre and the Park Avenue Ultra, the division`s biggest and most expensive offerings. These are very good cars.\n\nOddly enough, however, though the Ultra-as the name implies-is the top- of-the-line model, we favor the LeSabre. Perhaps the main reason is that the LeSabre starts at $20,775 and the Ultra at $28,780, roughly an $8,000 spread. If the Ultra offered $8,000 more car or the LeSabre $8,000 less car, then there would be no contest.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the two cars is that the LeSabre comes with the 3.8-liter, 170-horsepower V-6 engine teamed with 4-speed automatic, and the Ultra comes with the same 3.8-liter V-6 engine and 4-speed automatic, but it has a supercharger to boost h.p. to 205.\n\nThe 3.8 is one of our favorite GM engines in terms of performance. With downsizing and lopping pounds and inches from the big GM cars, the 3.8-liter V-6 was able to handle the task of what had become the full-size car. Some owners still would like to see a 600-h.p. V-8 under the hood, but unless 25- cent-a-gallon gas returns, they`ll have to accept a 170-h.p. V-6. Suffice it to say a V-6 will move 3,000 pounds as well as the V-8 used to move 6,000. Buick helped pioneer turbocharging at GM. Turbos slowly have given way to superchargers. Both systems are designed to drive a turbine that forces an extra fuel/air dose into the combustion chambers. The turbocharger employs exhaust gases to drive that turbine, and the supercharger is belt-driven, meaning no wait for the exhaust gases. With a turbocharger, you experience lag time while the exhaust gases go to work.\n\nThe supercharger kicks in as soon as you hit the pedal and gives you an immediate shot of energy, so you can enjoy the power bursts of a V-8. The supercharger lets you slip away from the light with more authority because once it kicks in, it`s as if the afterburner was lit. You have the ability to kick the pedal and gl ide out quickly into the passing lane, overtake the slowpoke and give the slower traveler a glimpse of your taillights as you move down the roadway looking for another target to overtake. It means the engine won`t sputter or cough midway up the hill because you have power in reserve when needed.\n\nAn added benefit is that the LeSabre without supercharger is rated at 18 miles per gallon city/28 m.p.g. highway, and the Ultra with the supercharger is rated at 17/27, only 1 m.p.g. less in city and highway driving.\n\nPower is one thing, a suspension system that can handle it another. The LeSabre and Ultra pass muster on the ability to coddle the occupants without pampering them.\n\nSoftly sprung suspensions bordering on mushy had been the trademark of Buick luxury cars. After 30 or 40 years behind the wheel, Buick owners were tired of being jostled and wanted to be caressed. Engineers catered to them. Springs and shocks were made of Jell-O.\n\nToday, the LeSabre and Ultra sport dynaride suspension as standard, a combination of the right up-and-down play to keep occupants from jarring their teeth (not necessarily store-bought anymore), with the right side-to-side control to provide almost Pontiac Grand Prix-like grip of the pavement in corners and turns. Safety, after all, means keeping control of the vehicle, and one way to do that is to have the final say in which direction the vehicle travels when you move the steering wheel.\n\nTo the above-average suspension, the LeSabre and Ultra we drove added gran touring suspension with automatic level control and 16-inch wheels, rather than the standard 15-inch, for even more road-holding capability.\n\nThe only problem we experienced in both cars is that they came with leather seats. Leather, as we`ve long said, is cooler in the winter and warmer in the summer and more slippery in making side-to-side maneuvers at any time. LeSabre started at $20,775. Standard equipmentincluded a driver-side air bag, power brakes with anti-lock, power steering, power windows with driver- side express down, electric rear-window defogger, tilt steering, intermittent wipers, pass-key theft deterrent (meaning the key is coded so it works only in the ignition), 15-inch steel-belted radials, deluxe wheel covers, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with digital clock, front and rear reading lights, dual body-color mirrors with left remote/right manual, clearcoat paint and trip odometer.\n\nOur test car came with a prestige option package running $2,611 and including power seats, power door locks, remote keyless entry (press the key fob to lock/unlock the doors), cruise control, dual driver/front seat passenger air-conditioning controls, power antenna, upgraded radio with AM stereo and cassette, dual power mirrors, lighted visor vanity mirrors, bodyside striping, door edge guards, remote trunk release, cornering lamps, locking wire wheel covers, whitewall tires and convenience net in the trunk.\n\nLeather seats added $500, the gran touring suspension and aluminum wheels and leather-trimmed steering wheel (an odd package to say the least) added $484, a compact disc player added $264, and tachometer and gauge package $138. With a $555 freight charge, the sticker read $25,327.\n\nThe Ultra base price is $28,780. It had the same standard equipment as the LeSabre plus cruise control, upgraded electronic air-conditioning controls, power seats, automatic level control, solar tinted glass, electric fuel filler and trunk release doors, upgraded radio with cassette, dual remote mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors and power door locks.\n\nThe test car same with a luxury option package running $1,229 that included power trunk pull-down, automatic power door locks, remote keyless entry, concert sound speakers, illuminated entry, twilight sentinel, cornering lamps, oil level monitors, power antenna, low-fluid and door-ajar reminders, automatic day/night inside mirror, whitewall tires, door edge guards, four- note horn and convenience net in the trunk.\n\nAn upgraded radio with AM stereo and disc player ran $394, the gran touring suspension with 16-inch blackwall tires and leather-wrapped steering wheel ran $86. With a $600 freight charge, the sticker totaled $31,089.\n\nOne final note to the folks at Buick about two changes we`d like to see: Get the headlight switch off the door and back on the dash where it belongs, and please let the stylists design a front end that doesn`t have to use the `81 Century grille. Thank you.\n\n>> 1992 Buick LeSabre\nWheelbase: 110.8 inches Length: 200 inches Engine: 3.8 liter, 170 h.p. V-6. Trhway. Base price: $20,775. Strong point: No longer a car just for the geriatrics. Excellent performance, room and comfort. Above average suspension system. No need to spend $8,000 more on a Park Avenue Ultra. Weak point: Styling, though not deadly, isn`t much better than dull. Place the headlight button back on the dash where it belongs and get it off the door. For $25,000 no passenger side air bag? >>",

      "expert_review": "The Buick LeSabre is not one of autodom’s leading sex objects.\n\nIts styling goes beyond conservatism and achieves yesteryear. The protruding chrome door handles are ’50s fugitives. Ozzie and Harriet would have loved the seats. The dashboard design speaks to us from a fresher grave.\n\nAnd you know what? None of that anachronistic frumpiness has hurt the LeSabre’s popularity one bit. It continues to be America’s best-selling full-size sedan, a title it has held for the last five years.\n\nThe reason for its sales supremacy is that its clientele doesn’t care about the book’s cover. These people buy the car because it is roomy, reliable, comfortable, quiet — and a heck of a value. The LeSabre, which is very well-equipped in base form, starts at $22,465. The test car, a top-of-the-line Limited model loaded to the gunwales, weighed in at $28,386.\n\nOne of the first things you notice about the LeSabre is that it has been rigged for silent running. That quietude is accomplished in several ways: The car is solid and rattle-free, and keeps wind and road noise to a minimum.\n\nThe LeSabre also affords a very comfortable ride, particularly when fitted with the standard suspension.\n\nThe problem with that regular suspension is its excessive softness. It is downright mushy, and that mushiness is not welcome in corners briskly taken.\n\nThe car handles much better when equipped, as the test car was, with the Gran Touring Package. This $337 goodie bag includes a firmer suspension, and substitutes 16-inch touring tires for the standard 15-inch all-season radials. This gear leaves the car much more controlled in the corners with very little ride trade-off.\n\nThe nice ride and respectable handling achieved with the Gran Touring Package are complemented by good engine performance. Indeed, the LeSabre is not a stoplight dragster, but it is a lot livelier than you might expect a large, comfortable American sedan to be.\n\nThe power is courtesy of General Motors’ wonderfully simple and efficient 3.8-liter V-6. Over the years, GM has tweaked and refined this seemingly obsolescent pushrod design to a point where it is very durable, powerful and economical. It is also very inexpensive to build when compared with its four-cam, multivalve counterparts.\n\nThe engine used in the LeSabre is the normally aspirated, 205-horsepower version. The 3.8 is available in other Buicks with a supercharger, which boosts the horsepower harvest to 240.\n\nThe good motivation this engine imparts to the LeSabre is matched by its fuel economy. The LeSabre test car had EPA mileage ratings of 19 city and 30 highway. Imagine that: 30 miles per gallon from a true six-passenger sedan. By comparison, the Mercedes-Benz C280, a much smaller, midsize car, has EPAs of 21 and 27.\n\nIn fairness, the LeSabre’s good mileage doesn’t derive entirely from its engine’s economical nature. The car is also surprisingly light for its size. The Limited model I tested has a curb weight of 3, 465 pounds, which is only 149 pounds more than the Mercedes.\n\nWhile it ain’t heavy, the LeSabre sure is big inside. It has an interior volume of 125.5 cubic feet. That compares with 107.7 in a Chrysler Concorde, 88 in the C280, and 101.5 in the Ford Taurus.\n\nThe spacious cabin is matched by a gargantuan, 17-cubic-foot trunk. Upholstery is standard in this cavernous space. Wall hangings, walk-in closets and a fire escape are extra. One thing I found wanting on the LeSabre Limited was four-wheel disc brakes. I understand this vehicle isn’t intended for spirited driving, but you would expect a car this well-equipped to have discs at all four corners.",

      "expert_review": "During the past couple of weeks, you’ve probably visited or been visited by a senior relative or two. Betcha they drive a Buick LeSabre.\n\nOf course, that wouldn’t be a hard bet to win, since most Buick buyers are somewhere between 62 years old and death. Many are loyal Buick buyers, especially when it comes to full-sized cars and one full-sized car in particular, the Buick LeSabre.\n\nFor more than a decade, it has been the best-selling full-sized car in America and it didn’t get that way by accident. It does so by catering to traditional American car expectations: a bench seat, column shifter, horizontal dashboard, roomy interior and sizable trunk.\n\nMost are probably sold in the same color as the test vehicle: “Light Bronzemist Metallic.”\n\nAs you might expect with a conservative car from a conservative company, the changes are incremental. Last year saw the introduction of the “Celebration Edition,” a package that continues for 2004.\n\nThe package groups embroidered leather seats, blacked-out grille, 16-inch chrome wheels, memory seats/mirrors/climate control/radio presets, outside auto-dimming mirrors, Stabilitrak, heads-up display and a trunk convenience net into a $1,950 option package.\n\nBuick claims the package has been very popular, but it’s the car itself that really appeals to many buyers.\n\nWhy?\n\nEasy. This car is as old-school American as they come.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive LeSabre comes in two trim levels, Custom and Limited. It’s built from the same platform as the Pontiac Bonneville.\n\nPower is courtesy of GM’s ancient, but still virile, 3.8-liter V-6, rated at 205 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. A smooth-shifting four-speed automatic is the sole transmission.\n\nPower is quite sufficient thanks to engine torque with lots of grunt down low. Getaways are quick, but be careful going into corners. The traditional soft, steady Buick ride means that the LeSabre leans heavily in corners. It also means some nose-dive in hard stops. While you won’t scrape the door handles going around corners, you will slow down. (A Gran Touring option will firm up the ride somewhat, but it seems out of place.)\n\nSteering is feather light; brakes are somewhat spongy. It results in a very boring car to drive.\n\nOf course, that means that if you don’t feel the bumps you’ll never know that they’re there.\n\nIf the handling sounds like a traditional Buick luxo-barge, keep in mind that some sophisticated electronics reside underneath. Brakes are four-wheel discs with anti-lock. Suspension is fully independent, with an auto-leveling rear suspension. It helps ensure the front end is pointed skyward when you fill the huge 18 cubic foot trunk with luggage. In addition, GM’s stability control system, Stabilitrak, is available as an option.\n\nWhile that’s all well and good, the LeSabre’s competitors all have better handling. (For the rec ord, that includes the Toyota Avalon, Chrysler Concorde, Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis as competitors.) That said, the Buick has decent grip, better than expected.\n\nInside, GM has done a mediocre job of fitting the interior.\n\nThe dashboard is easy to use, but bland. Fit and finish will not keep the Japanese, European or Korean automakers up at night.\n\nThe split front and rear bench seats allegedly each hold three people, but like other seats of this type, only a masochist would sit in the center. Comfort and support is subpar both front and rear, with the rear seat being too low. There’s also less rear seat space than you’d expect considering the vehicle’s size.\n\nWhen it comes to features, Buick has it covered.\n\nAll LeSabres have power windows and door locks, cruise control, delayed entry and exit lighting, battery rundown protection, lockout prevention, auxiliary power outlet and a theft-deterrent system. Options include a driver’s information center, auto-dimming rearview mirror, upgraded audio system with steering-wheel-mounted controls, aluminum wheels, traction control, and illuminated vanity mirrors.\n\nIt’s worth popping for the Limited for its added content.\n\nYou can get automatic dual climate control, 10-way power front seats, power lumbar control, heated front seats, AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio system, heated mirrors and side airbags. OnStar and XM Satellite Radio are available on both trim levels.\n\nThe test vehicle had a full array of options including a moonroof and XM Satellite Radio. For $9.95 a month, you’ll get 100 channels, including music of the ’40s, which most Buick customers will appreciate.\n\nWhile it felt comfortable and competent, the LeSabre didn’t seem like a very well-rendered version of a typical Detroit full-sized car, especially one labeled a Buick. But Buick has suffered as other divisions at GM have received more attention and development money.\n\nStill, there’s plenty of value here.\n\nPrices start at just $25,745 for a LeSabre Custom, $31,520 for a LeSabre Limited. The test vehicle came in at $34,865. That’s about the same as a mid-sized Toyota Camry, which tops out in the $34,000 range. In other words, mid-sized money, for a full-sized Buick.\n\nThat’s why Buick sells so many LeSabres.\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nTires: P215/70R15\n\nWheelbase: 112.2 inches\n\nLength: 200 inches\n\nWidth: 73.5 inches\n\nWeight: 3,591 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 18 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $31,520\n\nAs tested: $34,865\n\nEPA rating: 20 city, 29 highway\n\nTest mileage: 22 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: Detroit, Mich.",

      "expert_review": "THE VISITS dwindled into convenient absences marked by excuses moreakin to lies. We grew tired of one another, weary of dancing arounddelicate issues: What is it about blacks? What is it about whites?Rather than answer, we let the casual poetry group die.\n\nThat was two years ago, maybe three. It was hard to remember the lasttime I was in the big pink house in Bay Ridge, Md., overlooking theChesapeake Bay. It was a fun destination on any test drive.\n\nThat’s what driving is all about — going somewhere to meet somebody,to be someplace. Otherwise, why bother? That was the question nagging atme as I inexplicably pointed the 1994 Buick LeSabre Limited in thedirection of the big house in Bay Ridge. Surely I wasn’t going to stopthere.\n\nI didn’t. I drove right by, slowing down only when the LeSabre’soptional traction-control system became active, automatically cuttingback on engine power and gently applying anti-lock brakes, thusindicating that I had hit a patch of icy road. It’s a good early-warningsystem that allows the driver to take corrective action and avoiddisaster.\n\nUnfortunately, friendships don’t come with the same equipment.\n\nBackground: For several years, the LeSabre has been America’sbest-selling full-size car, which is puzzling. Not because the car lacksquality. It’s just that the LeSabre and the Oldsmobile Eighty Eight arepractically the same cars, both made by General Motors Corp. Thedifference is that the Olds Eighty Eight has a prettier, moreintelligent instrument panel.\n\nAnyway, for 1994, the LeSabre has all of the other stuff found in theOlds Eighty Eight. That means it comes with standard dual front airbags; standard anti-lock brakes; standard PASS Key II theft-deterrentsystem (meant to thwart the casual car thief); standard ozone-friendly,R134a air-conditioner refrigerant; standard four-speed, automatictransmission; and a standard 3.8-liter, V-6 engine rated 170 horsepowerat 4,800 rpm. Maximum torque in that engine is 225 foot-pounds at 3,200rpm.\n\nThere are two LeSabre models — the reasonably well-equipped Customand the tested, super-plush Limited. Both are front-engine,front-wheel-drive cars capable of carrying six passengers and 17.1 cubicfeet of luggage.\n\nComplaints: The LeSabre shares the instrument panel found in thebigger, super-full-size Buick Park Avenue. That linear, be-buttonedpanel works better in the larger car than it does in the smaller one,where it carries a cluttered, busy appearance.\n\nThe LeSabre’s power-seat buttons on the interior door panels alsoneed work. They are simply too confusing. You can spend all day pushingthem without ever finding the best setting for your back and bottom: Theessence of power-seat hell.\n\nPraise: When you find an acceptable power-seat setting — livable,but by no means perfect — the LeSabre becomes a highway dream car. It’sa smooth, tight sedan with excellent build quality. Anyone shopping fora full-size family or exe cutive sedan should put this one on the list.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Senior sexpot — nice body, a few wrinkles.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and acceleration.I’ve long grown fond of GM’s 3.8-liter V-6, one of the best six-cylinderengines made anywhere.\n\nBrakes include power front discs/rear drums with anti-lock backup.Braking got top marks on slippery roads. Also, the LeSabre Limited’soptional interactive traction control — automatically combininganti-lock braking and engine control systems — won kudos.\n\nMileage: About 26 to the gallon (18-gallon tank, estimated 450-milerange on usable volume of regular unleaded), running mostly highway anddriver only with light cargo.\n\nSound system: Six-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette, GM/Delco.Oops! This one was a little funky on the downbeat. Lots of disturbingvibration in the bass register.\n\nPrice: Base price on the LeSabre Limited is $24,420. Dealer invoiceis $21,368. Price as tested is $ 25,840, including $845 in options and a$575 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Great car, but the comparable Olds Eighty EightLSS, at $2,000 less, is a better buy.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuicks full-size front-drive sedan was redesigned in 2000 and is the top-selling model in its class. The LeSabre is about due for a face-lift, but it probably wont see one for another season or so. Though the styling differs, the LeSabre rides the same front-drive platform and is powered by the same 3.8-liter V-6 engine as the Pontiac Bonneville  though Pontiac also offers a supercharged V-6. Buick aims its traditional full-size sedan at older buyers, and it does so successfully.\n\nThe LeSabre Custom gets new eight-spoke, 15-inch aluminum wheels for 2002, while the Limited model earns 16-inchers. The Limited also gains standard leather upholstery, along with memory seats and mirrors. LATCH child-seat tethers are installed, and the Driver Information Center now works in either English or Spanish.\n\nThe LeSabre is conservative in styling and is distinguished by its familiar wide, oval, vertical-bar grille. It rides a 112-inch wheelbase and measures 200 inches long overall, compared to Buicks largest and most expensive model, the which is nearly 7 inches longer overall and has a 113.8-inch wheelbase. The LeSabre is 73.5 inches wide and 57 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nA standard front bench seat gives the LeSabre full six-passenger capacity. Front bucket seats are optional but have been installed in about 5 percent of LeSabre models. The Limited sedan has a rear center armrest with a pass-thru to the spacious trunk, which holds 18 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nBuick calls the front seat a catchers mitt style because of its operation. In a rear-end collision, the head restraints move up and forward, close to the occupants head, to reduce the risk of whiplash injury. GMs OnStar communication system is standard in the Limited and comes as a factory-installed option for the base Custom sedan.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBuicks familiar 3.8-liter V-6 engine produces 205 horsepower and drives the front wheels via a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard. Dual-stage front airbags inflate at one of two levels depending on crash severity.\n\nDriving Impressions\nNothing like the big Buicks of old, the modern LeSabre offers plenty of passenger space and a satisfying experience. It has reasonable fuel economy and a moderate sticker price. Not only is performance smooth, but it is more satisfying than many shoppers might expect. The LeSabre accelerates eagerly  practically lunging ahead when the gas pedal hits the floor  and takes full advantage of its excellent powertrain. Downshifts are quick and easy, which helps give the sensation of a lighter automobile.\n\nHandling is passable, and the LeSabre feels more secure in corners and curves than some smaller, sportier models. But its soft suspension permits too much body lean and tire squealing to allow spirited driving when the road gets seriously twisty. Then again, most LeSabre drivers arent going to hit the gas pedal that hard anyway.\n\nIn terms of comfort, the suspension cushions small bumps neatly. Occupants might hear an occasional bang from down below in reaction to big imperfections, but they arent likely to feel much at all, as the LeSabre does a good job of keeping the pavement at bay.\n\nSeat bottoms are short but nicely cushioned and supportive, though they lack in side bolstering. Gauges are easy to read, but the dashboard emits a lot of little green lights at night, which can be annoying. The LeSabre runs quietly and is more enjoyable to drive than most big cars, despite its old-fashioned personality.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Ahh, youth.\n\nNo worries, no cares.\n\nTrading baseball cards with friends until the new model year Chevrolet or Ford zipped by, starting an argument about which looked better and moved faster and which each of us would tool around in when the time came.\n\nIf memory serves, no one in the group stood up to defend the Buick LeSabre. And no one, even the guy who eagerly collected Washington Senators cards, admitted to aspiring to own a LeSabre.\n\nThough that was then and this is now, we still don’t hear anyone say that they can’t wait for the mortgage to be paid off and the kids to be out of school so they can sit back, relax and purchase a Buick LeSabre.\n\nNot that it isn’t a fine car–it’s one of the best on the market and the top-selling full-size sedan for a gazillion years–but LeSabre is a machine for OFs–or Old Folks (perhaps you thought something else?).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe you don’t aspire to a LeSabre, but if you find yourself in one, there aren’t a lot of reasons to complain.\n\nWe test drove the 2001 LeSabre Limited. Perhaps old in terms of conservative styling even after its 2000 model-year remake, but certainly reliable. Usually LeSabre returns to the dealership only for oil changes before making the final trek years later to a trade-in on a new one.\n\nLeSabre has more room than one couple can possibly use, even if both bring their luggage and golf clubs.\n\nAnd it has more than enough power to get you going from the light, up the hill, down the merger lane and along the interstate–while getting 19 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway in a full-size sedan powered by a quiet 3.8-liter, 205-horsepower V-6 with 4-speed automatic.\n\nComfort galore front seat and back. Wide supportive seats so you can relax on short- or long-distance trips.\n\nPlenty of amenities, such as dual-zone climate control that allows separate settings for Ma and Pa upfront; AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player; 10-way power, heated seats, though if you aren’t comfy and cozy after about the third way, you should seek medical help; dual-stage air bags that base deployment speed on severity of impact; side-impact air bags; four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and traction control; rain-sensing wipers that go to work on their own without a wake-up call; and an OnStar emergency communications system.\n\nBut then there’s the styling, phoned in by the same outfit that does most full-size General Motors sedans–Bland & Boring. In fairness, B&B must be doing a satisfactory job, because you’ll see the same influence in just about every Japanese family sedan today.\n\nThe LeSabre Limited we tested starts at $28,796. The gamut of comfort and convenience items is standard (including, for some reason, the trunk cargo net designed to help motorists part with buttons, pens and sometimes fingers when trying to load/unload packages). Only a few options are offered because few are needed.\n\nWe’d advise just two–the $235 Gran Touring suspension that’s tuned for smooth ride with very little sacrifice in handling (you have to expect some body lean in a sedan this long and wide) and that comes with 16-inch, all-season radial tires designed to resist road harshness; and the $730 driver confidence package that includes StabiliTrak, the advanced vehicle stability control system that uses engine management and/or ABS to help maintain control in a skid or slide in corners or turns.\n\nForget the $190 optional memory seats/mirrors with power lumbar driver seat unless you switch drivers daily.\n\nAuto Intelligence, an automotive Web site being set up and still not available to the public, says LeSabre, along with Century and Park Avenue, is in for dramatic change in the ’04-’05 time frame. The Century name is slated to be dropped with the car joining the Regal fold, and LeSabre might be renamed Signia; and Park Avenue, LaCrosse. Buick wouldn’t comment, but Ron Zarrella, president of GM’s North American Operations, told us “LeSabre is a name we’ll never walk away from. We have too loyal of a customer base for that car.”",

Or maybe a Regal if not a Century.\n\nOf course, a new Century might not have been all that fitting because it’s scheduled to go away soon as a separate model and become an option package on the next-generation Regal for ’05.\n\nOh well, at least Century made the first century.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nWord is that when Bob Lutz arrived and took over advance product development at General Motors, one of his first tasks was to survey vehicles planned by each division.\n\nWhen Lutz visited the Buick studios to see future products approved by Ron Zarrella, former head of GM’s North American automotive operations, he ordered the designers chained to their computers and locked in their cubicles until their imaginations were resuscitated.\n\nLutz’ philosophy is that a vehicle’s design must have enough emotion to entice a human being to become indebted for 24 to 48 months to satisfy his or her passion.\n\nBefore Lutz arrived, Buick’s advance products stirred emotion, but, it has been said, the emotion was melancholy. So future products, such as the next-generation LeSabre and Regal, were pushed back a year while others, such as the open-top Bengal tribute to Buick ad spokesman/golfer Tiger Woods, were shelved.\n\nSo rather than an all-new vehicle to commemorate 100 years in the business for ’03, you’ll have to settle for a LeSabre with body-colored lower fascias/rocker-panel moldings and chrome-plated aluminum wheels.\n\nDoesn’t get the heart palpitating, but it could be worse. Just ask Oldsmobile.\n\nBut we digress again.\n\nReportedly Buick’s game plan calls for the next-generation LeSabre/Regal due out for the ’05 model year, with Regal up early, LeSabre later in the year. And a final decision has to be made on the LaCrosse concept replacing the Park Avenue after ’05. With Olds going out of business, Buick reportedly will inherit the Silhouette minivan for ’06–with a new name.\n\nStill to be determined is whether Buick will add a new sedan/sport-utility crossover originally dubbed Centurion. The concept, renamed Centieme, French for 100, will be on this year’s auto-show circuit to test public reaction to an all-wheel-drive machine with three rows of seats. First thing showgoers should do is petition GM to hire someone sober to pick new names.\n\nTo give Buick a token new product until reinforcements arrive, a V-8 powered Rainier midsize sport-ute companion to the Rendezvous will bow as an ’04 model next fall. It’s built off the midsize Chevy TrailBlazer, not the extended length EXT version with three r ows of seats.\n\nDigressed enough.\n\nWe tested the ’03 LeSabre Celebration Edition. Styling is Buick conservative. Two-tone seats and chrome plated wheels do little to liven up the look.\n\nBut LeSabre is function over flash.\n\nTo sum up, it is big, roomy, comfortable and quiet, just like it has been year after year after year.\n\nFront- and rear-seat room is cavernous, as is the trunk, which will hold not only the golf clubs, but perhaps even the electric cart as well.\n\nSmooth ride and precise handling, too. Smooth ride isn’t surprising, because you’d expect–no, demand–that in a premium sedan. The precise handling is a pleasant benefit, considering LeSabre is not just a premium sedan, but a really big, full-size premium sedan that you’d expect to float in corners and turns. It stands its ground.\n\nOf course, the addition of StabiliTrak helps. That’s the Cadillac stability-control system that keeps you pointed in the right direction and revents lateral wandering to avoid slip, slide or skid regardless of road surface.\n\nLeSabre is a full-size sedan able to climb inclines, merge swiftly into traffic and pass gray hairs slumbering in the center lane, yet it delivers 20 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway, a rating some vehicles half its size would love to carry on their window sticker.\n\nThe 3.8-liter, 205-horsepower V-6 teamed with 4-speed automatic delivers ample power, though some would argue that a supercharged V-6 would be even more desirable. You have to move up to the Park Avenue to get one.\n\nThe Celebration package also adds a lot of fluff items, such as two-tone leather-trimmed seats, memory seats and mirrors, 16-inch chrome-plated wheels, redundant turn signals in the sideview mirrors, and head-up display to flash such information as vehicle speed in a screen along the bottom of the windshield in front of the driver.\n\nDon’t know how well those redundant turn signals do in warning motorists behind that you are about to turn, but from the driver’s seat, they look like beacons that quickly catch your attention.\n\nThe head-up display allows drivers to keep hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. Though a benefit for old and young drivers alike, Buick said another goal for HUD is to add even more information because it then can eliminate gauges from the instrument panel.\n\nAn extra-cost item on the Celebration is XM satellite radio that offers 100 channels. In keeping with the character of the car being driven, we set the dial to tunes from the ’50s, though you can move up through the ’60s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s or lock into rap, an easy sing-along because nearly all the words are only four letters.\n\nThe LeSabre Limited sedan starts at $30,650. Add $1,885 for the Celebration package.\n\nStandard equipment includes dual-stage front air bags and dual side bags, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, power windows/mirrors/locks/seats, traction control, OnStar, automatic leveling suspension, rear window defogger, remote keyless entry, moisture-sensing wipers, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD changer and heated seats.\n\nOnly item added was the XM radio at $325, plus freight at $710.\n\nLeSabre has a reputation as one of GM’s most bulletproof cars. Change the oil, and it runs forever. Only time you bring it back to the dealership is to trade it in on a new one. You’ll just have to wait a couple more years until that’s possible.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuick’s full-size LeSabre sedan uses the same front-wheel-drive platform and 3.8-liter V-6 as the Pontiac Bonneville. Redesigned for 2000, the LeSabre has been the top-selling model in its class, but will be replaced for the 2006 model year by Buick’s new Lucerne.\n\nA Celebration Edition was introduced in 2003 and continues into 2005, along with Custom and Limited models. All 2005 LeSabres have GM’s OnStar communication system that features upgraded hands-free capabilities. Four new option discount packages and new machine-faced 16-inch aluminum wheels are available. All LeSabres have GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system.\n\nExterior\nLeSabres are known for conservative styling, led by a distinctive, wide, oval vertical-bar grille. Riding a 112.2-inch wheelbase, the sedan measures 200 inches long overall and 57 inches tall. A Gran Touring Suspension Package features 16-inch touring tires and a specially tuned suspension with a rear stabilizer bar.\n\nThe Celebration Edition features a blacked-out grille, body-colored lower fascias and rocker moldings, integrated turn-signal indicators on the outside mirrors and 16-inch chrome-plated wheels.\n\nInterior\nA standard front bench seat lets the LeSabre seat six occupants. Optional front bucket seats are generally installed in only a small number of LeSabre models. The Limited sedan has a rear center armrest with a pass-thru to the spacious trunk, which holds 18 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nBuick describes the front seat as “catcher’s mitt” style because of its operation. In a rear-end collision, each head restraint moves up and forward, close to the occupant’s head, as a means of reducing the risk of whiplash injury. Power windows and locks, cruise control, lockout protection and a theft-deterrent system are standard.\n\nThe Leather & Sound Group of options includes CD and cassette players and XM Satellite Radio. The Leather & Comfort Group adds heated front leather seats and mirrors, moisture-sensing wipers and side-impact airbags.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBuick’s familiar 3.8-liter V-6 produces 205 horsepower and 230 pounds-feet of torque and drives the front wheels via a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on all models. Side-impact airbags are standard in the Limited model and optional in the Custom.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFar removed from the big Buicks of old, the modern LeSabre offers plenty of passenger space, a satisfying ride experience, reasonable fuel economy and a moderate price. Not only is its performance smooth, but this sedan is also more satisfying than many shoppers may expect. The LeSabre accelerates eagerly � practically lunging ahead when the gas pedal hits the floor � and takes full advantage of its excellent powertrain. Downshifts are quick and easy.\n\nHandling is passable, and this car feels more secure in corners and curves than some smaller, sportier models. The soft suspension permits too much body lean and the tires squeal too often to allow spirited driving, but it cushions small bumps effectively.\n\nThe front seat bottoms are short, nicely cushioned and supportive, but they lack side bolstering. The gauges are easy to read, but green lights on the dashboard can be annoying at night.",

      "expert_review": "The 1997 Buick LeSabre Limited is an old folks’ car. It’s big and roomy. When it moves, it galumphs — bounding along highways in a self-satisfied, triumphant manner.\n\nIt’s filled with old stuff, like the awkward, chrome-plated, power-seat controls mounted on the left interior front-door panel.\n\nThe controls include little linear buttons and a small disc, which are used to operate the lateral and vertical motion of the driver’s seat. As presented, they make absolutely no sense. But they’re pretty.\n\nThe LeSabre Limited’s seats are wide, with a 55/45 split bench up front and a long bench in the rear. That means you can carry six people, instead of the usual five able to fit in the passenger cabins of most of today’s cars. Those big seats also mean you don’t have to diet, or bump your head to get into the LeSabre.\n\nLet’s see, there’s so much more, such as “theater dimming” interior lighting. It’s sort of like going to an opera inside of your automobile. You take your seat before the performance, which involves starting the engine in this case. The interior lights fade to black. Kinda neat.\n\nSome of you, by now, think that I’m being cutesy, cynical, maybe engaging in aput-down of old folks. T’aint nothin’ farther from the truth.\n\nThe LeSabre is what the LeSabre is, a big ‘ol front-wheel-drive family sedan, and a lot of people like it that way. I count myself among them. I’m 49. This car is beginning to appeal to me.\n\nBackground: A significant measure of a car is the way it runs in the marketplace, where the LeSabre had been running well — the best-selling full-size sedan in the United States — for four years straight.\n\nThe LeSabre held on to that title in 1996, even though its sales dropped 7.1 percent, to 131,316 cars, from 141,410 sold in 1955.\n\nBy comparison, the comparable Ford Crown Victoria tallied 108,789 in 1996, and the Mercury Grand Marquis garnered 99,770, according to the latest available figures from J.D. Power and Associates, a consumer market research firm in Agoura Hills, Calif.\n\nOh, I know that the rear-wheel-drive Crown Vic and Grand Marquis are mechanically the same cars. But, hey, the auto industry counts product sales by model names, not vehicle platforms.\n\nAnyway, the LeSabre came out on top, and it’s easy to understand why. Despite oddities — its old-fashioned, bulging, chromed exterior door handles come to mind — it is an extremely well-made car.\n\nBuick did little to revamp the LeSabre for 1997. But what was done — a reshaping of the front grille and a reworking of the headlamps — gave the car a more cosmopolitan appearance than its somewhat dowdy-faced predecessor.\n\nFunctional changes include new electronic controls that seem to have eliminated any hint of transmission downshifting during acceleration. Structural upgrades include improved side-impact barrier protection in crashes.\n\nThe LeSabre is offered in two trim levels, the Custom and the more expensive Limited. The standard engine for both cars is General Motors Corp.’s 3.8-liter Series II V-6, which is rated 205 horsepower at 5,200 rpm with torque rated 230 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm.\n\nIt’s a traditional push rod engine — which means its overhead valves are opened and closed by a tubular device. Detractors call that arrangement archaic and inefficient. But the darned thing runs smoothly.\n\nAn electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission is standard in the LeSabre, as are dual front air bags and antilock brakes.\n\nAll and all, the LeSabre is one of the best retirement homes on wheels available in the U.S. auto market.\n\n1997 Buick LeSabre Limited\n\nComplaint: I literally hate the power seat controls in this car. I really do.\n\nPraise: GM’s Delco Electronics group produces the best remote door-lock-entry systems in the business. I am absolutely convinced of this after conducting this experiment:\n\nI stood on the fifth floor of my newspaper building and aimed t e key fob — the signaling device — at the LeSabre, parked downstairs a couple of hundred yards away. The car’s horn sounded and its lights flashed at each push of the button, indicating that it was responding to the signal.\n\nBy comparison, the remote entry systems on cars such as the Mercedes-Benz E420 are duds. You’ve practically got to get on top of the E420’s doors in order for its electronic key fob to have any effect.\n\nHead-turning quotient: You can use all of the Grecian Formula you want, but if you’re running around in this car, everybody’s gonna know that you already have, or you’re waiting for, grandkids.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Soft to moderately hard ride. Quite decent handling in curves and emergency maneuvers. Enough acceleration to get you a ticket on anybody’s highway. Excellent braking.\n\nMileage: Considering that this is a full-size car, an impressive 25 miles per gallon (18-gallon fuel tank, estimated 425-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running driver only and mostly highway with light cargo (17-cubic feet luggage capacity).\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Limited sedan is $25,565. Dealer invoice is $23,392. Price as tested is $26,779, including$609 in options and a $605 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Excellent value for the dollar. Compare with Toyota Avalon, Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville.",

      "expert_review": "The outside door handles tell the tale.\n\nIt’s simple, really. Automobiles are designed for certain markets, and their components are created to attract certain car buyers. The door handles on the Buick LeSabre are a classic example.\n\nToday’s trendy pullout handles are small, flush and painted the color of the body. The handles you’ll find on the LeSabre – on most Buicks, for that matter – are these big, chrome-plated affairs with large, thumb-operated push buttons. They look like something off a car from the ’50s, not the ’90s. Which is right to the point.\n\nThe LeSabre is designed for older drivers, those who piloted big American cars in the ’50s and ’60s, who have no interest in BMW-style performance or Hondalike economy.\n\nThose door handles are a comfortable and friendly reminder of the cars they knew and loved. They’re large and solid, just like those cars. In today’s terms, the LeSabre is a big car, though midsize by definition.\n\nIt takes the place of the humongous rear-drive Roadmaster, which gets the ax after this season, along with GM’s other dinosaurs, the Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood.\n\nThe LeSabre has the feel of those bigger cars – soft and comfy, with big, tufted seats and a plush, isolating ride.\n\nUnlike those cars, which are powered by huge V-8 boat anchors, the LeSabre has plenty of power behind a V-6 – GM’S lovely 3.8-liter engine, which supplies 205 horsepower and significant torque. Decent gas mileage is a definite bonus.\n\nHandling is good, though hardly sporting. The Buick can be driven fairly aggressively, though you might find yourself bounding all over the road on the soft suspension. It does what it’s designed to do, smooth out the rough spots and swallow the bumps without jarring the occupants.\n\nCornering is easy, though accompanied by significant body sway. Steering is light and numb, but direct and easy to get used to.\n\nOverall, the styling inside and out is conservative, traditional and without surprises. The exterior is freshened for ’96. The rounded curves of the fenders and sculpted hood, which blends into the ovoid grill, are attractive but very much classic Buick styling.\n\nYou can squint at it and see Jaguar sedan, but it’s a stretch. Naturally, there’s less space inside than in traditional big cars, though seating for six is provided and the back seat has decent head and leg room.\n\nInterior trim is familiar GM ware, feeling comfortable with old-fashioned chromed switches and such. You can almost hear the strains of soft FM mood music filling the cabin. But I’ll attest to the fact that the fine Delco stereo system handles rock and roll just as well.\n\nThe dashboard needs some work, though. It’s flat and cluttered, and the gauges are remote and squishy looking, and seem almost like an afterthought.\n\nOur LeSabre came laden with luxury features but was still priced in the mid-20s, a bargain compared with most of its competition.\n\nThere is a virtual army of loyal Buick buyers, mostly an older crowd, attesting to the venerable marque’s continuing reputation for reliability and quality construction. Anyone else who craves traditional American values in a car that’s not too big and not too small and can live without sporting aspirations or modern trim should give the LeSabre a serious look. It’s a solid citizen.\n\n1996 Buick LeSabre\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive. Base price: $21,380. Price as tested: $24,000 (estimate). Engine: 3.8-liter V6, 205 horsepower at 5,800 rpm 230 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 3,430 pounds. Length: 200 inches. Wheelbase: 110.8 inches.

      "expert_review": "It’s hard not to think of Detroit or your old Uncle Leo when driving a big Yank tank like the LeSabre. This is the type of vehicle most Americans drove before their dreams and expectations were downsized in the 1970s.\n\nIt’s something they still appreciate. The LeSabre has been America’s best-selling, full-size car for seven years straight. It’s no great mystery why.\n\nIts big-as-Kansas size is comforting; its large persona is worn unabashed. If you think Americans don’t like their vehicles large and expressive, than you haven’t noticed all those large trucks roaming the roads.\n\nWell, okay, so its conservative styling isn’t that expressive, but Buick buyers like it that way. The front seems to resemble the smaller Century, while its beltline and rear more closely resemble the larger Park Avenue. It certainly fits its niche in the line-up in a handsome manner. Certainly, it’s much more modern than the overly dainty styling of the car it replaces.\n\nThe styling covers an all-new platform, which it shares with the upcoming Pontiac Bonneville. As is the GM norm, the new platform is 27 percent stiffer than the old one. This yields benefits in the ride and handling department that are far superior than the previous LeSabre. By stiffening the structure, it allows the suspension to spend more time isolating the car from road shocks and harshness.\n\nThe test vehicle was a Limited with the optional Gran Touring Package. The package includes a 3.05 axle ratio, blackwall tires, touring suspension and speed sensitive power steering. While there’s a hint of float over bumps, the touring suspension dials out the worst behavior, eliminating a bobbing Buick. While it’s not a BMW, it does allow the driver to toss this car around a bit more liberally.\n\nWhat the optional suspension doesn’t tame is body lean; it still has quite a bit of it –kind of like your ol’ Uncle Leo.\n\nBut your uncle would just love the engine. GM’s normally aspirated 3800 V-6 pumping out 205 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. It powers this car strongly off the line, as it does in most GM vehicles. It also emits the same somewhat-gruff engine note. It does mate nicely with the transmission, just like Leo did with your Aunt Edna all those years ago.\n\nBraking is courtesy of four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock. They’re stopping power seems much better than previously, with just a touch of nosedive.\n\nWhile the styling isn’t that large a departure, its interior is, being the largest single improvement on this car.\n\nThe interior is actually modern. Gone is the horizontal strip and tiny buttons and gauges that characterized the previous model. It is replaced by a curvaceous modern dash.\n\nThree round dials house four gauges and assorted lights. They’re large and easy to read. They rest just behind a new steering wheel which houses some of the most artfully designed steering wheel controls I’ve ever seen. These buttons rest naturally in the wheel; they’re not i n the way, they’re illuminated at night and easy to use by touch. Bravo.\n\nThe swoopy dash bulges outward slightly in the center, making the radio and climate controls easier to reach. The radio has really large controls, making it easy to use. Just below it are the climate controls, which are impossible to use without taking your eyes off the road. Their design is a carryover from the last model. The whole dash is accented by test-tube wood that curves naturally into the doors. This year sees the addition of side airbags, as well as seat-mounted seat belts — real safety advances for this sedan.\n\nThe test car came with the optional seating package, which replaces the front bench seat with what Buick calls bucket seats. While they’re just too wide and flat to be called bucket seats, they were upholstered in a good quality leather. The seating also made one of my legs fall asleep. The rear seats aren’t a lot different from the previous model, being low, short a nd slightly reclined .\n\nThe console, while having lots of storage space, has cup holders that, when in use, block the ashtray and another slide-out tray.\n\nThe trunk is roomy and festooned with handy tie-down points for the cargo net.\n\nBut if your Uncle Leo likes tradition, he’ll love this car with its smooth ride, improved handling and brakes, along with a handsomely executed re-style. This first Buick of the new millennium will keep attracting lots of traditional customers who appreciate the big American car attributes of the previous millennium.\n\nA fine ride, even if you’re not as old as your uncle. >> 2000 Buick LeSabre Limited\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter OHV V6\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\nStandard: Front and side airbags, power steering, tilt steering wheel, power locks/windows/mirrors, dual-zone climate control, auto-dimming mirrors, AM/FM/cassette audio system, keyless entry, twilight sentinel.\nOptions: Prestige Option Package (auto-dimming rearview mirror, AM/FM/cassette/CD and steering-wheel mounted audio controls, moisture sensing windshield wipers, traction control, power front seats, leather trim, heated front seats, Gran Touring Package, memory driver’s seat, Seating Package.\nBase price: $26,695\nAs tested: $29,420\nEPA rating: 19 mpg city, 30 mpg highway\nTest mileage: 21.6 mpg\n>>",

      "expert_review": "Buick engineers have done some fine-tuning on the 1993 LeSabre.\n\nIt was just last year that Buick overhauled the LeSabre. But Buick engineers haven’t been given much time off; there are a few improvements in the 1993 model.\n\nThis year, for instance, the seats are top-notch, the engine’s performance has been beefed up and anti-lock brakes are standard on all models.\n\nThe LeSabre exceeds what we’ve come to expect out of American cars in general and from General Motors in particular.\n\nI see no difference between the LeSabre or a Lexus or a Mercedes-Benz in the quality of the way the vehicles are assembled.\n\nIn fact, the LeSabre is one of the most impressive cars I’ve driven this model year.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThere’s a terrific engine under the hood of the Buick LeSabre – a 170-horsepower fuel-injected V-6 of 3.8-liters.\n\nThis engine has gotten better every year. For 1993, some minor tweaking has sharpened low-speed responsiveness and slightly increased fuel economy.\n\nTheLeSabre’s performance is excellent. Its smooth and powerful engine provides crisp acceleration and good all-round performance.\n\nAt 3,454 pounds the LeSabre is a fairly heavy car, but it can easily sail past slower moving traffic. The V-6 is mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that shifts so smoothly you probably won’t notice it.\n\nIn a week of driving, the LeSabre used unleaded fuel at the rate of 22 mpg in city driving and 29 on the highway.\n\nSome four-cylinder import econo-boxes can’t even top that.\n\nHANDLING\n\nOur test car came with the optional Gran Touring Package. If you are interested in a LeSabre, I recommend this option. For $464, you get a stylish set of 16-inch aluminum wheels and high-performance Eagle tires. Those items alone are well-worth the money.\n\nBut you also get an automatic level control, a firmer suspension and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThe test LeSabre, which had a beautiful Polo Green paint job, offered sporty handling – the ride was firm, refined, stable and smooth.\n\nUnderneath there’s an independent suspension system, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and disc/drum anti-lock brakes.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIn the past, I’ve felt that Buick’s interior designers could have done a better job in creating comfortable seats.\n\nThey came through in ’93. Generally, I don’t much care for bench-style seats. But the leather-covered bench seats in the LeSabre are the best I’ve seen in a midsize GM car.\n\nThey were firm, well-padded and, with their six-way power adjustments, able to accommodate a wide range of different-sized bodies. Rear seats also were comfortable, and passengers have plenty of leg and foot room.\n\nThe stylish dash also gets high marks for its sensible layout. Our test car came with a full complement of easy-to-read analog gauges.\n\nBuick also has moved the light switch to the upper edge of the door panel, making it e asy to reach. In past models, it was somewhere behind the steering wheel.\n\nThedual-zone air conditioner, which allows the passenger in the front seat to set the temperature on that side, is a nice touch.\n\nLeSabre is Buick’s best-selling car, and the 1993 model should enhance the car’s sterling reputation for quality, reliability and value.\n\nTruett’s tip: The LeSabre ranks as Buick’s finest sedan to date. It’s a well-equipped car with graceful road manners, and it offers good fuel economy and solid value.",
