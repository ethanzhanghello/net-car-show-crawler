      "expert_review": "Posted on 10/23/2002\nVehicle Overview\nLast reworked for the 1997 model year, Buicks mainstay midsize front-wheel-drive sedan has been the companys most popular model. Older buyers, in particular, tend to like the Centurys front bench seat, which offers space for three occupants.\n\nAntilock brakes are no longer standard for the 2003 model year. The Centurys body gets a fresh look with a new graphite/chrome grille, chrome door-header openings, and new body-colored fascias and side molding. Additional interior trim padding aims to improve head-impact protection. New wood-grain switch plate covers are installed, and two new body colors will be offered.\n\nConstructed from the same basic design as the sportier Regal, the four-door Century is more conservative in appearance, which helps account for its appeal to older buyers. Beneath the hood is a 3.1-liter V-6 engine, which differs from the Regals 3.8-liter power plant.\n\nThe Century has been a long-time rival of the full-size Buick LeSabre in the race to be the most popular Buick model. In its regular form, the Centurys front bench seat provides six-passenger capacity, which is offered on only a handful of midsize models.\n\nExterior\nAlthough its styling is related to that of the jauntier Regal, the Century has a different grille, rear styling features, body trim and wheels. That makes it relatively easy to tell the two apart at a glance. Both Buick sedans are 72.7 inches wide, stand 56.6 inches tall and ride a 109-inch wheelbase, but at 194.6 inches long overall, the Century is a little shorter than the Regal.\n\nInterior\nOther than the Centurys bench seating  vs. the Regals sportier front bucket seats  these cars interiors are very similar. The Century comes in a single trim level, but Custom and Limited option groups are available. All versions of the Century have a three-place front bench seat with a folding center armrest that includes storage space. Trunk capacity totals 16.7 cubic feet.\n\nStandard equipment includes dual-zone air conditioning, a tilt steering wheel, remote keyless entry, an AM/FM radio, and power windows and door locks. The Custom package adds folding power mirrors, cruise control, a cassette stereo and a six-way power drivers seat. The Limited sedan features leather-surfaced seat trim and chrome wheel covers. GMs OnStar communication system is a factory-installed option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.1-liter V-6 engine produces 175 horsepower and drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. The higher-performing Regal, by comparison, holds a 3.8-liter V-6.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with traction control are optional. A side-impact airbag for the drivers seat is optional with a leather-trimmed interior.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOnStar, General Motors satellite-based communication system, is a new standard feature on the Century Limited, the top-shelf version of this midsize sedan. OnStar is now a factory-installed option for the base Custom model.\n\nThe Century vies with the full-size LeSabre in a race to be Buicks most popular model. It is based on the same design as the Regal, also a midsize sedan, but caters to an older crowd with more conservative styling and a front bench seat that gives it six-passenger capacity.\n\nExterior\nThough the Centurys styling is similar to the Regals, a different grille, rear features, trim and wheels give it a unique appearance at first glance. Both ride a 109-inch wheelbase and come in four-door body styles.\n\nInterior\nOnly the bench seats separate the six-passenger Centurys design from that of the sportier Regal, which is available with front buckets. All models come with a three-place front bench seat with a folding center storage armrest.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 175-horsepower 3.1-liter V-6 engine and a four-speed automatic transmission comprise the only powertrain for the Century. The similar Regal comes with a 3.8-liter V-6.\n\nSafety\nIn addition to the federally required dual front airbags, the Century also comes with standard antilock brakes and traction control. A side-impact airbag for the drivers seat is included with leather upholstery, which is standard on the Limited and optional on the special edition version of the Custom.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "With so many historic Buicks at Das Awkscht Fescht, you could get a hankering to try a new one.\n\nWell, you’re in luck: The most popular model is also Buick’s least expensive: the front-wheel-drive Century.\n\nThe name has been around for the best part of the 20th century. It started out as a factory hotrod, sporting Buick’s largest engine in its smallest body. But, for the last three decades or so, the Century has been a mid-sized model.\n\nSince 1997, the Century has shared its body with the Regal. The Regal tries to hide its Buick heritage — with mixed success — by dispensing with chrome, and offering a tighter suspension with bucket seats and a center console. The Century is more handsome, with a classic chrome grille, a bench seat and a column-mounted shifter. Obviously, Buick buyers agree. The Century outsells the Regal by more than 2-1.\n\nThe Buick Century was very popular in 1999, the fourth most-popular mid-sized car in the country after the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus.\n\nSo what’s to like besides the price tag? A lot.\n\nIn an era when cars are getting to feel more and more alike, the Century’s truly retro personality makes it stand apart. This is a purely American car and it doesn’t try to hide it.\n\nThe styling job is one of GM’s finest, with a swoopy beltline and a tasteful application of chrome that doesn’t go overboard. It’s handsome in the classic Buick sense. It doesn’t have the traditional Buick bulk, and most will find the dimensions just right.\n\nFor the turn of the century, the Century comes in three trim levels: Custom, Limited and a special edition 2000 model. The biggest difference between the three is trim. The special edition gets a blacked-out grille treatment (although some chrome remains) body-colored side moldings and fascias, special badges and a leather-trimmed interior.\n\nAll Centurys have the same engine. This 3.1-liter V-6 develops 15 more horsepower (175) than last year, and 10 foot-pounds more torque (195). Hooked to a new four-speed electronic automatic transmission, the engine moves this 3,371-pound car with adequate oomph, although the Regal’s 3800 V-6 is smoother and more responsive. The Century accelerates fine from a stop, but seems to lack power when entering a freeway. However, the engine appears to be quieter than before.\n\nThe transmission upshifts quickly. While this provides few thrills, it nets excellent fuel economy for a mid-sized car with V-6 power. Mostly highway driving yielded 28.5 mpg on regular unleaded.\n\nThe handling calls to mind Buicks of yore: soft. There was plenty of body lean, but the ride was cushy enough to please its audience (like your Aunt Edna). The down side: Rough roads turn the ride turbulent, but that’s typical of the breed.\n\nThe suspension is all independent (although a bump can still send the rear skittering sideways), and anti-lock braking is done with front discs and rear drums. That’s no worse than many domestic and imported competitors. Braking performance was perfectly adequate, with some nose dive in hard stops.\n\nThe cabin is quiet. Features like triple door seals help keep it so.\n\nThe front split bench seat was as comfortable as your living room sofa, but without the bad upholstery. The seats were surprisingly supportive, despite the lack of side bolstering. The storage armrest splits the front seat, and has flip-out cupholders, plus room for cassettes and CDs.\n\nThe rear seats are split and fold to provide access to the trunk. The rear armrest has room for storage. Leg room is a bit tight.\n\nThe sweeping dash is as horizontal as the Midwest. The radio is mounted high, and the special edition model has steering wheel-mounted radio controls. Like the ones on other current Buicks, these controls get hot and their location at the edge of the steering wheel makes it easy to inadvertently increase the volume or change he station on the AM/FM-cassette-CD. Its sound quality was better than some more expensive GM vehicles.\n\nThis year, all models get a dual climate-control system and rear seat heating ducts, a feature shared with more expensive models. The system works well.\n\nThe car was packed with lots of luxury gear that made riding with friends a pleasure. Up front, power seats and a tilt wheel make a good driving position possible. Leather and expertly matched vinyl lend the interior an upscale feel. An electrochromatic rear-view mirror was easy on the eyes. The only real improvement to the interior would be a horizontal strip speedometer — then it would have a retro look to match the retro handling.\n\nThe only real flaw in this otherwise pleasant car occurred on a trip to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Airport. In the middle of nowhere, the “Low Tire” light came on. According to the owner’s manual, this means a tire has lost at least 12 pounds of air. I certainly couldn’t feel any change, despite the Century’s power-numbed steering. A quick stop revealed nothing to be the wrong. Actually, the tires seemed overfilled. Hitting the reset button in the fuse box (accessible only by opening the door) solved the problem and it never recurred. But all four tires were puckered on their sidewalls, possibly a result of their over-inflation.\n\nThe 16.7-cubic-foot trunk is huge and has a convenient cargo net.\n\nA week in this Century showed that it has the same attributes spurring the sales of its more popular competitors: handsome, conservative styling, reasonable fuel economy, a comfortable interior, decent ride and a nice price tag. It’s not exciting for a car enthusiast, but this class of car isn’t meant for car enthusiasts.\n\nWith GM struggling to find its identity with so many other car divisions, it’s good to see the traditional values and handsome styling that come with Buick DNA are still a part of the American car-buying psyche.",

      "expert_review": "Century.\n\nSeems that’s how long Buick’s midsize sedan has been on the market.\n\nTry as it might to drive a stake through the Century’s engine for the last five years, the media has been unable to get Buick to discontinue the front-wheel-drive Century A-body, which first appeared in 1982.\n\nThat’s the same media that tried to send the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird to the hereafter about a decade ago.\n\nThe problem with Century is that though scribes feel the technology is outmoded, the car-buying public loves the machine.\n\nWell, not everybody finds rapture in Century. It’s a car mostly for older folks (OK, 45 and up) who are intimidated by high-tech and whose vocabulary has not expanded to ROMs or bytes or even Madonna.\n\nCentury is admired by conservatives who want basic transportation. A vehicle that will hold four to five adults in comfort, if not style. A sedan whose power is measured not in how quickly you scoot from the light, but how frequently it passes those roadway oases labeled Amoco, Mobil or Speedway.\n\nCentury delivers what its loyalists want-room, comfort, mileage and low price. Maybe the package this comes in isn’t the prettiest on the highway, but while the Bonneville or Taurus owner pulls out the wallet to show pictures of the SSEi or SHO that he or she saved for, the Century owner simply pulls out the wallet and shows off the pictures of Hamilton or Grant that he or she saves by owning a more practical machine.\n\nWe test-drove a 1994 Century Custom sedan here, which for the new model year has undergone significant change by Century standards.\n\nStyling changes are minor-a new vertical bar grille and revised taillamps-but just enough to give an old car a fresher appearance.\n\nAnd those hoping Buick would come up with a touch more power will find the standard 4-cylinder engine and new optional V-6 fractionally livelier.\n\nThe base 2.2-liter, 4-cylinder engine in the Century Custom sedans gets a power boost to 120 horsepower from 110 in 1993 for less sluggish movement from the curb. Fuel injectors also were revised for faster cold starts. It is offered only with a 3-speed automatic, however.\n\nThe mileage rating is 25 miles per gallon city/31 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe 160-h.p., 3.3-liter V-6 that was optional and available only with a 3-speed automatic for 1993 has been replaced by GM’s 3.1-liter, 160-h.p. V-6 teamed with a 4-speed automatic. By switching from multiport to sequential-port fuel injection, Buick boosted the 3.1’s horsepower to 160 from 140 in the current model year.\n\nOur test car came with the 3.1, V-6 and 4-speed automatic and delivered ample punch for the car’s functional character. The move to a 4-speed makes a big difference in terms of performance and seems to have removed the parachute Century had been saddled with from the 3-speed.\n\nRather than focus on 0- to 60-mile-per-hour readi ngs, however, Century owners prefer the 19 city/29 highway rating from this engine/transmission.\n\nWhile Century fans aren’t high-techies who demand the latest in gadgetry, they are safety conscious, and for 1994 Buick delivers what they’ve been begging for-a standard driver-side air bag and standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes, features found more typically on high-price midsize sedans.\n\nWhen you slip behind the wheel, you see the security offered by the “SRS” for supplemental restraint system ( a.k.a. air bag) lettering in the steering wheel hub. All that’s lacking now is an air bag for the passenger.\n\nThankfully we didn’t have to check out how well the air bag works in our test drive, but we had occasion to apply the ABS under simulated panic stops on dry and wet roadways. In both instances, the car stopped in a straight line with hood and deck lid pointing in the same direction without performing a roadway rumba.\n\nWhere Century brings you b ck to reality is when you try some aggressive maneuvers, such as sharp turns or tight corners at speed.\n\nOur test car had Dynaride suspension, which in most Buicks means softness over the bumps but firmness when the road twists. Century shows its age even with Dynaride. Back off from the accelerator when taking that sharp turn or you’ll ride the sidewalls. Sadly, only 14-inch treads are offered because larger 15-inch tires would provide better grip and improved ride and handling.\n\nYou also experience body lean-yours and the car’s-if you try taking the corner as if in a Regal Gran Sport.\n\nInside, Century is strong on room and comfort, with one exception. The power window controls on the upper front of the door are an obstruction for your knee.\n\nIn response to consumers, Buick changed the power door-lock system for 1994. It now offers an automatic lock/unlock/relock feature. In the past when you put the gearshift in “D” (drive), the doors would lock. When you got to your destination and put the lever in “P” (park), the doors would stay locked until you pressed the unlock button. Now, you can have the dealer remove a fuse and when you stop and put the lever in park, the doors will unlock to allow you a speedy getaway.\n\nOther nice touches on the Century for 1994 include a redesign of the so-called prindle, or PRNDL, lettering in the dash so the “P” is far removed from the other gear lettering so older drivers can better see it; positioning of the rear-window defroster button in the center of the dash to the right of the steering wheel, where it is easily seen and used; and designing power-window buttons with one side raised, denoting “open,” and the other side flat, denoting “close,” so you can work the windows at a touch without taking eyes off the wheel.\n\nOther changes to Century for 1994 include consolidating the line by dropping the Custom coupe and wagon and Limited sedan and keepingonly the Special sedan and wagon and Custom sedan; adding tilt wheel, trip odometer, intermittent wipers and door courtesy lights as standard; and adding compact disc player, locking wire wheel covers, adjustable level control and chrome luggage rack on sedans and woodgrain bodyside applique on the Special wagon as new options.\n\nIn addition to the standard equipment mentioned above, all Centurys have air conditioning, power brakes and steering, carpeting, side-window defoggers, tinted glass, dual sideview mirrors (left power), AM-FM stereo with clock and all-season radials tires. The Custom model also adds dual cupholders and visor vanity mirrors.\n\nOther than the knee knocking of the power window housing by the driver’s leg, the other change we’d like to see made is positioning of the power seat controls on the side of the seat, where they’re easier to use, rather than underneath in the front, where they are now.\n\nThe base price of the Century Custo m sedan is $16,695.\n\nTo take advantage of the rising value of the yen against the dollar and the subsequent sharp Japanese price increases, Buick has come up with market value editions of the Century for 1994. The car is loaded with options as standard at a discount. The Century Special sedan will start at $14,995, a $1,500 savings.",

      "expert_review": "THIS IS A city of old things, a place of tradition. It’s the perfectsetting for a test drive of the Buick Century, America’s most aptlynamed car.\n\nFrom its body to its dashboard, the Century is a work of motorizedmoss — so dated, so funky, it could be on display in a museum.\n\n‘Tis a wonder that Buick had the temerity to call the currentCentury a “1995 model.” I mean, look around. What other 1995 car hassuch linear, boxy, uninspired lines? Step inside. That dashboard, withall of its angular weirdness, could fit into a scene in one of AnneRice’s vampire novels.\n\nBut all is not lost. The car has some bright touches, such as thedashboard-mounted map light, illuminated interior door handles, brighterwarning lights and — finally! — an arc-shaped speedometer that’sactually readable.\n\nThere are other good points. But the whole of the Century is quiteunderwhelming — about as exciting as sitting in a dank Bourbon Streetbar, sucking on a bottle of Dixie beer.\n\nBackground: The Buick Century has been around for 14 years. It’s afront-wheel-drive, mid-size sedan, which is also sold as a wagon. It’sdevoid of anything approaching soul or personality.\n\nIf you can accept that, or, if it doesn’t matter, the Century is agood deal. It’s a solidly built machine. It’s reliable, very comfortablefor five people and reasonably comfortable for six.\n\nThe Century comes with one of two engines. There’s a 2.2-liter,inline four-cylinder job rated 120 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, with torqueset at 130 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm. It’s an adequate engine, but it’snot much more than adequate in a car that weighs nearly 3,000 pounds.\n\nBetter to get the optional 3.1-liter V-6 rated 160 horsepower at5,200 rpm, with torque set at 185 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm. It gives theCentury substance.\n\nA three-speed automatic transmission is standard with thefour-cylinder engine, which makes it more of a slug. A four-speedautomatic comes with the 3.1-liter V-6.\n\nThe car comes with one air bag — for the driver.\n\nIt also comes with those ludicrous, door-mounted automatic seatbelts. Egad! Talk about passe!\n\nStandard brakes include power front discs/rear drums with anti-lockbackup.\n\nComplaints: Interior and exterior styling, and those goofy”automatic” seat belts.\n\nPraise: Overall build; improved, more comfortable seats in the 1995car; good luggage space at 16.2 cubic feet; reliable familytransportation.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Zip.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Very good highway ride, especiallyon straightaways. Dicey handling on curves. That is, the front endthreatens to lose composure on any curves taken at speed. Decentacceleration with the V-6 engine. So-so acceleration with theinline-four. Braking was okay — meaning that especially in this car,you have to apply common sense before you hit the brakes. This isn’t aperformance car. Understand?\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with compact disc.GM/Del co. Very good.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon (16.5-gallon tank, estimated365-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), combinedcity-highway, running with one to six occupants and light cargo.\n\nPrice: Base price is $16,360. Dealer invoice is $14,642 on basemodel. Price rises to $17,965 for the Century Custom package; dealerinvoice for that package is $16,079.\n\nThe Custom package includes leather-faced seats, power windows and,um, whitewall tires. Price for the whole Custom shebang is $18,500,including a $535 destination charge. Purse-strings note: It’s wortha look. But there are much more enjoyable, competitively priced mid-sizecars, such as the Mazda 626, the completely revamped 1995 ChevroletLumina, Chrysler Cirrus, Ford Taurus, Ford Contour, Honda Accord, NissanMaxima. But, hey, none of those has the Century’s historical value.",

      "expert_review": "The previous Buick Century went back to the early ’80s and looked it. From its dated dash to its snorific styling, it was an archeological dig into the boring nature of GM family sedans during that decade.\n\nBut people kept buying them in big numbers right up to the end, because the cars were inexpensive, roomy and comfortable — and they didn’t break.\n\nThe 1997 replacement for that midsize sedan is a quantum leap beyond it. It is a more advanced, more refined vehicle with more contemporary styling. It is also a stronger car, which means it has less chance to squeak and rattle.\n\nIndeed, about all it has in common with its predecessor is its drivetrain, soft ride and low price.\n\nThis roomy, midsize family car opens at $17,885, a base price that includes a V-6, a four-speed automatic gearbox, antilock brakes, power windows, and power door locks with keyless entry. The test car, a top-of-line Limited model equipped with everything but a Jacuzzi and a two-story marble foyer, listed for $21,895, including shipping.\n\nNow that, dear friends, is a shrimp appetizer, the lobster main course, and a flaming dessert for the price of a Happy Meal.\n\nStructurally and mechanically, the new Century is a kissing cousin of the all-new Buick Regal, which, in turn, is closely related to the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Pontiac Grand Prix.\n\nBut while it has much in common with the more expensive Regal, it lacks that car’s style, refinement, power and athleticism. The Regal is fitted with the 3.8-liter V-6, which develops 205 horsepower in normally aspirated form, and 240 when fitted with a supercharger. The Century is available only with a 3.1-liter, 160-horsepower V-6.\n\nThe Century also is a less agile car than the Regal, whose sportier suspension tuning gives it more control and poise during rigorous cornering.\n\nThis isn’t at all surprising. Like its predecessor, the new Century is more interested in delivering a soft ride than handling prowess.\n\nWhile I would prefer a firmer suspension, I can’t say the Century is a mushmobile. It does all right in the corners. There’s some body lean, but it’s hardly excessive.\n\nThe Century isn’t wanting in the power department, either. As a matter of fact, it is one of very few under-$18,000 family cars equipped with a V-6 — and turns out to be rather lively business.\n\nLike the popularly priced Japanese midsize sedans, the Century is attractively but conservatively styled. It’s a safe design, a sculpting job that looks nice but doesn’t make enough of a styling statement to call too much attention to itself.\n\nThe interior is more interesting. The design is very graceful and functional, and nowhere is this more obvious than on the flowing, accessible dashboard.\n\nAnd like the Century’s soft ride, its interior reflects the car’s emphasis on comfort rather than performance: The driver’s seat provides little of the lateral support you need for spirited driving.\n\nWhat the interior does have in a bundance, in addition to style and comfort, is roominess and quiet. There’s plenty of room for five adults in this car, and the cavernous, 17-cubic-foot trunk should take care of their luggage with ease.\n\nThe Century does pretty well on fuel for a 3,350-pound sedan. It has EPA mileage ratings of 20 city and 29 highway. I got 21 m.p.g. during mostly city driving.\n\nThe Century is available in a number of attractive colors that, I suspect, were named by people who had smoked too many funny cigarettes. The test car, for example, was painted “Santa Fe Red Pearl.” I don’t remember reading about marine biologists finding red-pearl-bearing oysters in the New Mexico desert, but I suppose it’s possible.",

      "expert_review": "It doesn’t take a whole lot to improve a car with a life span slightly longer than the Ice Age. But the Buick Century attracted its loyal following with a combination of low sticker price and traditional Detroit amenities.\n\nThese drivers like it soft and quiet, and value this over the ultimate in sophisticated engineering.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Buick from creating a much more refined automobile for the latest incarnation of the Century.\n\nThe newest iteration is based on GM’s new mid-size car platform, which also carries the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Intrigue and Buick’s own Regal. The Century has a slightly different character from the Regal, with which it shares most of its visual cues.\n\nThe body shell of both cars differ in details. The Century takes a more liberal approach toward chrome, with a somewhat formal chrome grille up front, and more open-handed use around the body. This is something the Regal avoids. Neither car is trendy; both have conservative baby Buick-like looks.\n\nInside, the interiors are similar but, where the Century uses the all too typical bench seat and column shifter, the Regal uses bucket seats and a console. Certainly the seating is comfortable in the Century. But any thoughts of actually carrying six people in this car will shortly be dashed. Those in the center position up front surely will strangle you the minute the ride is over for sentencing them to ride on this high, uncomfortable perch.\n\nThe storage armrest that serves as a backrest for this uncomfortable center passenger serves as a resting place for the cup holders as well as coins, CDs or tapes. Gaining access to these things can be a problem if someone is using the center position.\n\nRear seating is much improved over the old cars, with chair-height seating and much improved legroom. Front and rear seats could use a little firmer padding and lower back support, though.\n\nAside from the lack of a center console, and its handier storage, the interior is identical to the Regal. This means clear, large instrumentation (sans the Regal’s tachometer). Idiot lights monitor volts, oil pressure and the like. The radio is high on the sensuously curving dash, and the test vehicle included an AM/FM-cassette-CD player. The audio system has good imaging, although overall sound quality was only fair.\n\nWhat’s impressive about the Century is content for the price. It’s available in two trim levels: Custom (base price $18,215) and the upper level Limited (base price $20,270). The test car was a Limited, which is worth springing for if you want such standard features as dual automatic climate control, variable effort power steering, rear center armrest, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, power mirrors, retained accessory power and front seat storage pockets. Available on all Centurys are keyless entry, automatic door locks, automatic headlamps, power windows, air conditioning and rear seat heating du cts.\n\nAn option worth considering is the integrated child safety seat, located in the center of the rear seat. Another one is GM’s OnStar. Hooked to a hands-free cellular phone is a Global Positioning System that can track where your car is and give you directions if you’re lost or it can recommend a nearby restaurant. An option worth skipping is steering-wheel-mounted audio controls. They’re located right where your hands fall, and it’s too easy to change stations or raise the volume inadvertently.\n\nIf you notice that I haven’t talked a whole lot about what this car is like to drive, it’s because this is not really a driver’s car and is inferior to its more expensive sibling, the Regal.\n\nWhile the Regal gets Buick’s smooth, silky 3.8-liter V6, the Century makes do with the corporate 3.1-liter V6. This workhorse engine pumps out an adequate 160 horsepower, 35 less than the Regal’s mill. With a full load, this strains with a hoarse growl that’s pretty unrefined. I ‘s obtrusive. There is no engine option.\n\nHooked to a fairly smooth-shifting four-speed automatic, it makes adequate work of getting around. The suspension is fully independent, but is set for a softer ride. Bump absorption is good in either the Regal or Century. The difference is that the Century has a l-o-t of body lean, and the body rocks long after the bump has passed. All this motion makes one notice the poor condition of some roads in the Lehigh Valley.\n\nThe tires aren’t much help. Asked to do anything beyond a moderate pace and these puppies howl in protest. Fast starts set the tires spinning, and because traction control isn’t available on the Century, this can happen often. Wet-weather grip is better.\n\nAnti-lock brakes and dual air bags are standard.\n\nThe trunk has almost 17 cubic feet of space and features a low lift-over. It’s roomy and flat and has a cargo net standard.\n\nDespite its positioning as a cheaper alternative to the Regal, it comes off more as a shrunken LeSabre. Certainly, the content of the vehicle is generous for the price. At around $20,000, this car offers a lot of little luxuries at a family-bus price. It also modernizes the traditional American sedan, and that should keep Century owners happy until the next one.\n\n1998 Buick Century Limited Standard: 3.1-liter V6, four-speed automatic transmission, dual air bags, anti-locks brakes, keyless entry, daytime running lamps, battery rundown protection, P205/ 70R15 tires with bolt-on wheel covers, speed-sensitive steering, tilt steering column, air conditioning with air filtration system, power windows with driver express down, power door locks, dual power outside heated mirrors, dual visor vanity mirrors, front and rear map pockets, theater lighting, lockout protection.

      "expert_review": "Expect the 1999 Buick Century Limited to get more attention now that Oldsmobile will drop its cousin, Cutlass, which was built off the same platform, after the ’99 model run.\n\nThe only drawback was the wife’s comment, “It’s an old-people’s car,” made when her husband was behind the wheel, not when she took command.\n\nCentury offers more room and more comfortable seats than Sonata or Accord, though a little trickery was used in back. The rear seat butt bowl is very deep. As such, your legs are forced closer to you to provide more rear-seat legroom without being scrunched against the backs of the front seat. Clever.\n\nThe 3.1-liter, 160-h.p. V-6 in Century is livelier, of course, than the Accord’s 4 and even the Sonata’s 170-h.p. V-6 because there is immediate response to the pedal. The mileage rating is 20 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway.\n\nLike Accord, Century offers ABS as standard, but Century adds traction control to help move into the intersection without hesitating when the pavement is covered with slop.\n\nSmoother, quieter ride than Sonata or Accord, with crisper steering response.\n\nBase price is a respectable $20,145, or more than $700 less than Accord.\n\nStandard equipment includes daytime running lamps; remote keyless entry; tire air-pressure monitor; speed-sensitive power steering; tilt steering; 15-inch all-season radials; air conditioning with cabin air filtration system; dual heated power mirrors; power windows/locks; AM/FM stereo with clock; and two features you can quickly grow to appreciate–lock-out prevention in which the power door won’t lock if you leave the key in the ignition and “starter grind prevention,” which disengages the starter if you forget the quiet engine is running and turn the key again, so you don’t experience the embarrassment of listening to metal grind.\n\nUnlike the Accord, there were a number of options, including a prestige package for $1,800 that upgrades the sound system to include cassette/seek-and-scan/controls in the steering column; cruise control; automatic dimming rearview mirror; rear seat armrest with cupholders; dual climate controls; and power driver/passenger seats; $625 for leather/vinyl seats; $375 for aluminum wheels; $75 for a body stripe; and $200 for a CD player with next/last tracking and automatic tone control; plus $560 for freight.\n\nSo, unless you can do without some of the gadgets, Century is a larger, roomier machine with the benefit of traction control, which, in the case of the test cars, ran about $2,000 more than Accord.",
