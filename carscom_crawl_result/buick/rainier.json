      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAs the 2004 model year began, a midsize luxury sport utility vehicle dubbed Rainier joined the Rendezvous “crossover” model in Buick’s lineup. Built with full-frame construction, the Rainier can carry up to five occupants.\n\nRainiers come with rear- or all-wheel drive. All are built on General Motors’ short-wheelbase midsize SUV architecture, which is also used for the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy. An electronically controlled rear air suspension is intended to produce a comfortable ride.\n\nAn inline-six-cylinder engine is standard, and it gains 16 horsepower for 2006. A 5.3-liter V-8 is optional. Woodgrain trim is standard on the instrument panel, doors and center console. Side curtain-type airbags are available.\n\nThough it is intended primarily for driving on regular pavement, the all-wheel-drive Rainier offers offroad capability, according to Buick, and is said to be “very capable on . . . an unpaved, two-track road.”\n\nExterior\nFor 2006, a new front grille and tri-shield emblem are installed. Sculpted wheel flares and shoulders are meant to enhance the Rainier’s appearance.\n\nClear headlights have offset high/low beam fixtures. Fog lamps with chrome surrounds are standard. Two-tone front and rear fascias are body-colored over gray, with the gray portion extending into the rocker panels. The Rainier features 17-inch wheels, power rack-and-pinion steering and Bilstein shock absorbers.\n\nInterior\nPerforated leather upholstery is standard, and heated front seats are optional. The monochromatic interior features chrome accents and dark woodgrain trim. Standard steering-wheel controls operate the stereo. With the 60/40-split rear seats folded, the Rainier has 80.1 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nThe instrument panel features green-needle gauges that are reminiscent of those in the Rendezvous. Dual-zone automatic climate control is standard, and the Rainier is equipped with GM’s OnStar communication system. A navigation system, DVD video system and XM Satellite Radio are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 291-hp, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder is standard, and a 300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 is optional. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission.\n\nSafety\nOptional side curtain-type airbags incorporate a new rollover sensing system for 2006. All seating positions have three-point safety belts, and all-disc antilock brakes are standard. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is also standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAs the 2004 model year began, a midsize luxury sport utility vehicle dubbed Rainier joined the Rendezvous “crossover” model in Buick’s lineup. Built with full-frame construction, the Rainier can carry up to five occupants.\n\nFor 2007, a one-year subscription to General Motors’ OnStar Turn-by-Turn navigation system and a tire pressure monitoring system now come standard. There are also two new exterior colors: Midnight Blue Metallic and Graphite Metallic.\n\nRainiers come with rear- or all-wheel drive. All are built on GM’s short-wheelbase midsize SUV architecture, which is also used for the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy. An electronically controlled rear air suspension is intended to produce a comfortable ride.\n\nAn inline-six-cylinder engine is standard, and a 5.3-liter V-8 is optional.\n\nThough it is intended primarily for driving on regular pavement, the all-wheel-drive Rainier offers offroad capability, according to Buick, and is said to be “very capable on … an unpaved, two-track road.”\n\nExterior\nClear headlights have offset high/low beam fixtures. Fog lamps with chrome surrounds are standard. Two-tone front and rear fascias are body-colored over gray, with the gray portion extending into the rocker panels. Chromed accents outfit the side roof rails and exterior door handles, and the grille features a large Buick tri-shield emblem.\n\nThe Rainier features 17-inch wheels, power rack-and-pinion steering and Bilstein shock absorbers.\n\nInterior\nHeated front seats are optional, and perforated leather upholstery and front bucket seats come standard. The monochromatic interior features chrome accents along with dark woodgrain trim on the instrument panel, doors and center console. Standard steering-wheel controls operate the stereo. With the 60/40-split rear seats folded, the Rainier has 80.1 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nThe instrument panel features green-needle gauges that are reminiscent of those in the Rendezvous. Dual-zone automatic climate control is standard, and the Rainier is equipped with GM’s OnStar communication system. A navigation system, DVD video system and XM Satellite Radio are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 291-horsepower, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder is standard, and a 302-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 is optional. A four-speed automatic is the sole transmission.\n\nSafety\nOptional side curtain airbags incorporate a rollover sensing system. All seating positions have three-point safety belts, and all-disc antilock brakes are standard. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is also standard.",

      "expert_review": "Goodwill Ambassador\n2004 Buick Rainier SUV\n\nIt was a night of beautiful traffic. The sky was clear, the moon full. The roads were salted, and the drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike were kind.\n\nMaybe it was the cold. The nocturnal scene was frigid, 12 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Buick Rainier’s outside temperature monitor.\n\nOnly a committed hothead would raise hell in that kind of deep freeze. Anger needs heat. None was climatically available. This was good.\n\nThe Buick Rainier sport-utility vehicle, new for 2004, is a luxury liner. Although it is built body-on-frame in the manner of traditional SUVs and pickup trucks, it is better suited to peaceful cruising than combat. It is a living room on wheels, best enjoyed at a casual pace, even with the optional 5.3-liter, 290-horsepower V-8 engine in the tested Rainier CXL AWD model.\n\nThat does not mean the Rainier is weak. It shares a platform with the GMC Envoy and Chevrolet TrailBlazer, its ostensibly tougher midsize SUV cousins.\n\nThe difference, especially in comparison with the TrailBlazer, is that the Rainier is more refined and more politically acceptable.\n\nThe TrailBlazer, for example, looks very much like traditional SUVs: square-bodied, rugged, borderline military. It easily could be called the TrailConqueror.\n\nBut the Rainier eschews more-macho-than-thou exterior design. It is sleek, car-like, people-friendly. The trademark oval Buick grille mimics a smile. The Rainier’s overall demeanor, inside and out, bespeaks family — albeit a family with a big household income.\n\nThere is something reasonable about the Rainier’s proportions. Nowadays, car companies have gotten it in their heads that all SUVs must have third-row seats — that such vehicles must be able to accommodate at least seven people. It is a silly notion.\n\nFew of us drive around with six passengers in tow. That being the case, where is the urgent need for stretching midsize SUVs into something larger to carry seven people? Or, worse, for jamming a third-row “seat” into the rear quarters of a midsize SUV?\n\nThe Rainier answers those questions by providing sumptuous seating for five people — no more. It’s an SUV, not a school bus. I like that; and I liked it even more on the drive to Northern Virginia from New York with two family members.\n\nThere is peace in space, and the Rainier offers lots of interior space along with a couple of optional “space heaters,” such as those installed in the driver’s and front passenger’s seats in the tested vehicle.\n\nEquipped properly, the all-wheel-drive Rainier CXL can be taken off road. But why would anyone want to do that? The Rainier has a premium exterior paint job and pretty, 17-inch, brushed aluminum wheels. The interior, though largely a work of top-grade vinyl, has leather-surface seating, thick carpeting, and (in the test model) an optional B ose stereo system. Does anyone really want to take that package through thickets, over rocks and fallen logs? I don’t think so, even though the Rainier has a suspension system — independent front suspension, and air springs with load-leveling capability in the rear — that could handle light-to-moderate off-road tasks.\n\nFrankly, I prefer thinking of the Rainier as an excellent station wagon, one that offers an SUV’s high-riding view of the road along with the stability and grace of a well-tuned, large sedan.\n\nYou aren’t going to win any road races with it. Inasmuch as the Rainier is not the least bit intimidating, you aren’t going to frighten anyone into giving you more than your share of the road either. It’s just a nice, friendly, very useful and enjoyable vehicle — sort of like a good neighbor. Perhaps it should have been called the Buick Ambassador.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Some of my peers in the automotive media complain about the amount f vinyl inside the Rainier. I think that’s nanny-nanny-boo-boo nitpicking. Many car companies, foreign and domestic, use vinyl interiors, especially in SUVs. Buick isn’t doing anything unusual.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Lovers of big sedans will applaud the graceful Rainier in all three categories. Truck lovers won’t — they want something hard. The Rainier is a tad soft.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Rainier is a statesman among SUVs, large or small. It has a dignity and acceptability reminiscent of the Volvo XC90, the first SUV to win a measure of acceptance among the anti-SUV crowd.\n\nLayout/body style: The front-engine Rainier is available as an all-wheel-drive or rear-wheel-drive vehicle. It has traditional body-on-frame construction with four doors and a hatch.\n\nEngine/transmission: Two engines are available: a standard 4.2-liter, inline-six that develops 275 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 275 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm; and the optional, tested 5.3-liter V-8 that develops 290 hp at 5,200 rpm and 325 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nMileage: I averaged 18 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nSafety: Standard four-wheel, heat-dissipating, vented disc brakes with anti-lock system; rear-wheel-electronic traction control; available side-impact air bags.\n\nPrice: Base price is $37,345. Dealer’s invoice price is $33,797. Price as tested is $41,040, including $3,110 in options and a $685 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Watch those options! Compare with Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, Lincoln Aviator, Mercury Mountaineer Limited and Toyota Highlander Limited.",
