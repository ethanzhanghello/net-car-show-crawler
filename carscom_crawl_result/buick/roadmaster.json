      "expert_review": "IT WAS TIME to say goodbye to the man and the car. The man was my father, Daniel T. Brown Sr., who died June 20 at 83. The car was the Buick Roadmaster, which expired this summer.\n\nThe two shared more than season of departure. They were big, conservative and peculiarly American. They had attitude.\n\nA lifelong teacher, my father understood the importance of discipline, work, merit and serving one’s country. For Daddy, that also meant “buy American,” which mostly meant buying General Motors when it came to cars.\n\nMy father and late mother, Lillian, owned a number of GM automobiles, mostly Chevrolets. When they came into a bit more money, Daddy wanted a more substantial car, “a big Buick,” he said. But Mom wanted a Cadillac, and got it.\n\nSo, I figured it only fair to drive the last of the Roadmasters, the biggest of Buicks, to my father’s funeral. That, plus the American flag honoring his Army service in World War II, was a fitting tribute to a life well lived.\n\nBackground: The hard truth is that the Roadmaster is gone because many of its would-be buyers, like my father, are gone — or going. Buick officials said the average age of Roadmaster buyers is 65. Those buyers don’t tend to be repeat customers.\n\nThat’s why Buick this summer ended production of the big, rear-wheel drive Roadmaster, whose name originally appeared in the Buick lineup in 1936 and continued through the 1958 model year. The name was reintroduced on the 1991 Roadmaster Estate Wagon and 1992 Roadmaster sedan.\n\nBut the new Roadmaster’s sales were dismal, falling 19 percent to 6,512 cars sold in the first four months of this year from a skimpy 8,037 sold in the same period last year. A similar fate affected the like-bodied Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham models, which also ended production this summer.\n\nDespite their considerable girth, I’m going to miss these cars. They were as comfortable as they were large. Every one of them, in fact, was a master of the road, especially on leisurely cross-country trips.\n\nAnd, Lordy, they were loaded! Power everything: windows, door locks, front seats, steering, brakes. You only needed a few fingers and right foot to drive these cars.\n\nStandard equipment on all Roadmasters included anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, electronically controlled air conditioning and analog gauges. Also standard was a 5.7-liter V-8 engine rated 260 horsepower at 5,000 rpm with torque rated 330 pound-feet at 2,400 rpm.\n\nAnd, of course, an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission was standard.\n\nComplaints: The bigness of it all — nearly 18-feet-long and seven-feet wide, weighing 4,211 pounds.\n\nPraise: The bigness of it all, plus overall craftsmanship, “roadability” and comfort. If you like big cars, you’ll love this one, which is still hanging around some Buick dealer lots.\n\nHead-turning quotient: A thing of great dignity.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Float, zoom and float. Th e test Roadmaster’s big V-8 took the worry out of lane changes, an often frightening experience in New Orleans traffic. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon (23-gallon tank, estimated 510-milerange on usable volume of recommended premium unleaded), combined city-highway, running with one to six occupants and a fully-loaded trunk (21 cubic feet).\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with compact disc, GM/Delco. Excellent.\n\nPrice: Base price on tested 1996 Buick Roadmaster Limited sedan is $27,490. Dealer invoice on base model is $25,153. Price as tested is $29,025, including $945 in options and a $590 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Prices on leftover 1996 Roadmasters (and companion Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham models) are highly negotiable. Shop carefully. Also consider buying used for an even better deal.",

      "expert_review": "The fat person is nicknamed Slim, the tall man is named Shorty and the Buick is called Roadmaster.\n\nThere’s a word for naming something the opposite of what it is. That word is misnomer, meaning Slim is fat, Shorty is tall and Roadmaster handles as if it needs double blade runners whenever there’s precipitation on the road.\n\nMaster of the road?\n\nHardly. The rear end wanted to go south when the rest of the car was pointed north during acceleration from a light or sharp turns on snowy roads. On dry roads stability was fine, which unfortunately rules out many days of motoring in the Snow Belt.\n\nRoadmaster is a rear-wheel-drive car, an icon from the past, when rear-wheel drive dominated and front-wheel drive was the new kid on the block.We tested the ’94 Roadmaster Limited sedan, which brought back lots of memories-about why front-wheel drive is so welcome.\n\nFour-wheel anti-lock brakes help bring the car under control, but what Roadmaster really needs is traction control and sensors working overtime to keep the wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces.\n\nOne reason the rear end has a mind of its own is that the Roadmaster is oneof the few remaining really big cars. It’s built on a 115.9-inch wheelbase andis 215.8 inches long. It tips the scales at 4,300 pounds.\n\nThe Roadmaster calls to mind the old law of physics about an object in motion tending to stay in motion until acted upon by an outside force. That rule and amo, amas, amat is all that was committed to memory in four years of high school, but it’s a lesson learned well.\n\nWe were surprised that our test vehicle came with a limited-slip differential, which should have prevented rear-end antsiness. Hmm. The car’s reaction to snow without the limited-slip differential?\n\nRoadmaster has tons of room. You could fit amo, amas and amat in the back seat and have room for their luggage and groceries in the trunk. Maybe even their skis or golf clubs, if not both.\n\nIt also has pretty good power from its 5.7-liter, 260-horsepower V-8 engine, teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission. By switching from multiport to sequential-port fuel injection, the 5.7 picked up 80 horsepower for 1994. Considering the limousinelike space and the passing and towing powerfrom the V-8, the 17 m.p.g. city/25 highway fuel-economy rating merits a kudo or two.\n\nDual air bags are standard.\n\nRoadmaster’s base price is $26,399. With a number of options and a $575 freight charge, the sticker topped $28,800.\n\nBuick has thinned its lineup, but in doing so it has improved the remainingmodels. Skylark, Regal, LeSabre and Park Avenue are above-average cars. Century and Roadmaster are the ones showing liver spots.\n\nThere’s speculation that in 1997 a new Roadmaster that owes its heritage toone of the Opel line of cars from GM’s European operations will appear. Cadillac will call on GM-Europe for its new entry-level LSE sedan in 1996 (t hough perhaps as a 1997 model), and Roadmaster is rumored to be another candidate for GM’s new hands-across-the-ocean approach, in which its worldwideoperations will design, develop and perhaps even build a model anywhere needed.\n\nRegardless of the country of origin, a more modern version of Roadmaster isneeded, a slimmer, trimmer model with a purpose other than the ability to tow a boat.\n\nWith the rear-wheel-drive Roadmaster Limited sedan starting at more than $26,000 and the only slightly smaller front-wheel-drive LeSabre Limited sedan starting at $24,640, we’d pocket the difference and buy the LeSabre.\n\nWe vote for LeSabre. Amo, amas and amat do, too.",

      "expert_review": "The Buick Roadmaster station wagon is one of my favorite cars of the ’92 model year.\n\nBefore spending a week with the big Roadmaster, no one could have told me I would like such a huge car and a station wagon at that – without me phoning for the men in white coats.\n\nBut hey, let’s give credit where credit is due. The Roadmaster station wagon is a class act. It is comfortable, powerful and roomy. And it’s loaded with ’90s creature-comfort features, such as a plush leather interior, a sunroof and a CD player. For safety there’s a driver-side air bag and anti-lock brakes.\n\nIf you have a large family and just can’t warm up to a minivan, a big station wagon is probably the next best alternative.\n\nThe Roadmaster and its cousin, the Chevrolet Caprice, are the only two wagons you can buy with V-8 power.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nYou would never guess the Roadmaster Estate Wagon weighs more than 2 tons – 4,508 pounds to be exact – judging by the way it performs.\n\nThe Roadmaster comes with a 5.7-liter fuel injected V-8 that provides 180 horsepower. The car may be big and heavy, but it is not slow. There’s plenty of muscle for passing and plenty for gaining speed to merge onto busy highways.\n\nA computer-controlled four-speed automatic is the only transmission available. In the test car, shifts from first to second were abrupt and a little rough.\n\nThe engine is smooth and quiet, and given the Roadmaster’s girth, the V-8 has a miserly attitude toward unleaded gas.\n\nDriven normally, the Roadmaster Estate Wagon returned 17.5 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway. Once cruising speed is reached, the engine isn’t running much faster than an idle.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Roadmaster’s soft and quiet luxury-car ride is its best trait.\n\nRoad noise is close to non-existent, and the big wagon seems to flatten minor bumps.\n\nThough heavy, the Roadmaster is easy to control, thanks to variable-effort power-assisted steering and front disc, rear drum anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe test car came outfitted with the optional ($325) trailer towing package, which included a limited-slip differential and a heavy-duty cooling system. Buick says this package allows the Roadmaster to tow up to 5,000 pounds.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFor the most part, Buick’s designers got the Roadmaster’s details right. You might consider the Roadmaster an alternative to a luxury minivan.\n\nThe driver’s window has a one-touch button that lowers the window automatically. There’s a wiper for the rear window. The tailgate opens in two ways: it either swings open or folds down.\n\nThe Roadmaster can seat eight people. With rear seat folded down, you can haul full-size sheets of plywood.\n\nThe driver and two passengers have plenty of room on the power-adjustable front bench seat, as do the three passengers in the middle seat.\n\nHowever, the fold-down rear seat would only be comfortable for small children. T here isn’t much leg room back there.\n\nBecauseI own a British car with real wood, I am usually not a fan of fake wood – inside or out. But the simulated wood panels on the outside of the Roadmaster looked nice and they fit well. I could live with it.\n\nThe alloy wheels gave the pewter gray metallic test car a classy look.\n\nThe Roadmaster wagon comes with a non-opening glass sunroof above the middle seat passengers. It’s unusual for a big wagon and a nice touch. The sunroof even comes with pull-out shades.\n\nBuick equips the Roadmaster with a simple, easy-to-read set of analog gauges that includes a tachometer. But the fuel gauge in the the test car was erratic. A sharp curve could make the needle swing from nearly empty to three-quarters of a tank.\n\nIf you’ve test driven the scads of minivans out there and haven’t found one you like, why not try a big wagon?\n\nBuick’s Roadmaster Estate Wagon is a people-mover par excellence.\n\nThe 1993 Roadmaster Estate – on sal now – has been given minor trim improvements but is the same car as the ’92.\n\nTruett’s tip: Buick’s Roadmaster Estate Wagon is an excellent alternative to a minivan. It is smooth, quiet, powerful and loaded with creature-comfort items.",
