      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — We reviewed the previous-generation Buick Regal GS in 2016 and concluded that the GS didn’t do enough to distinguish itself as a performance vehicle when compared with other Regal trim levels. Would that be different with the new one? I hit the road outside of Atlanta to find out if the 2018 Buick Regal GS could live up to its Grand Sport name.\n\nRelated: 2018 Buick Regal Sportback First Drive: Aiming for the Bleachers, Hitting the Infield\n\nWhat’s a Buick Regal GS?\n\nBuick gave the Regal GS more aggressive styling with unique front and rear bumpers, 19-inch alloy wheels, side skirts and a rear lip spoiler. But the changes are far from just cosmetic. There are Brembo brakes up front, a continuous damping control suspension, sport exhaust and three driving modes (Normal, Sport and GS). Sport and GS Buick Regal modes change five elements of the car: shift feel and schedule of the nine-speed automatic transmission, rear-wheel drive bias added to the trick twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system, increased steering effort and the amount of damping, which makes the Buick’s ride stiffer.\n\n2018 Buick Regal GS\n\nPowertrain: 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 and 282 pounds-feet of torque; nine-speed automatic transmission\nDrivetrain: All-wheel drive with torque-vectoring twin-clutch rear axle\nFuel economy: 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined\nKey features: Adaptive damping suspension, Brembo front brakes, head-up display, adaptive cruise control, sport exhaust, 19-inch wheels, Bose audio system\nAs-tested price: $43,510 (including destination charges)\nHow Does the Regal GS Drive?\n\nThe 3.6-liter V-6 in the GS makes more 60 more horsepower than the 250-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the standard Regal, but it weirdly makes less torque than that engine does in AWD Regal models (295 pounds-feet versus 282 pounds-feet with the V-6). The Buick Regal GS adds a nine-speed automatic with its AWD system, while the regular model only gets an eight-speed. The AWD system is the same one found in the Regal Sportback and Regal TourX. It’s an active twin-clutch system (similar to the one found under the Ford Focus RS) that can transfer 100 percent of the engine’s torque from front to rear and left to right rear wheels when conditions call for it.\n\nDoes the jump up in engine size pay off with performance dividends? Not really. I found the powertrain to be the weakest part of the Regal GS’ performance credibility. It seems hesitant to accelerate both off the line and while traveling at speed. This is like the experience that Cars.com reviewer Aaron Bragman noted in his First Drive of the Regal Sportback, saying, “Put your foot down in the AWD model, and the delay between pedal action and downshift is palpable, putting a damper on entertaining sportiness.”\n\nThe Regal GS doesn’t have steering-wheel-mounted transmission paddle shifters, which could really help deal with the engine’s responsiveness. It’s a weird thing to not put into a so-called performance-oriented vehicle. The standard Regal is also missing them, as Bragman noted in his review of the 2018 Buick Regal. Yes, you can use the gear shift to select gears, but it really isn’t the same thing. The V-6 doesn’t make maximum torque until 5,200 rpm, so it exacerbates the issue. Buick, I beg you: Paddles for the next car, please.\n\nOnce it does get moving, though, the Regal GS does have performance strengths. In Normal driving mode, the Buick’s ride is pliant and comfortable, but if you bump the car into Sport or GS mode, the suspension noticeably tightens up and the GS becomes surprisingly proficient in the corners for a 4,270-pound sedan. Both modes also add weight to the steering that gives the driver added confidence with increased resistance. I enjoyed throwing the Regal GS into corners, but when I would try to put power down to maintain momentum I would get a little frustrated again.\n\nOne performance feature I appreciated: The Buick’s Sport driving mode is customizable, so you can add steering weight to the car if you prefer while keeping the suspension in Normal mode, which is more comfortable on longer trips.\n\nOther features the Buick Regal GS does very well are its unique front sport seats, which are excellent, and the auto start-stop system that’s nearly seamless — which is good, because you can’t turn it off. Those front seats are standard on the Regal GS, and come with heating/ventilation/massage features and powered side bolsters and thigh support. They’re seriously comfortable, and I wish they were standard on every car I drive.\n\nHow Much Does the Regal GS Cost?\n\nThe Regal GS starts at $39,990 with destination charge. Our test car added three available packages: the Sights and Sounds Package for $945, with navigation, HD radio and a Bose audio system; the Driver Confidence Package #2 for $1,690 that includes adaptive cruise control, automatic forward emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane keep assist and a head-up display; and the Appearance Package for $485, with wireless charging pad, LED headlights, cornering lamps and automatic high beams. Tack on another $395 for the smoked pearl metallic paint and you reach the $43,510 as-tested price.\n\nIs the Regal GS Grand or Sport?\n\nWhile the Buick Regal GS fulfills the Grand part of its name with a comfortable ride and those wonderful seats, the Sport part still feels unfulfilled to me. That powertrain holds the Regal GS back a bit. I think the 2018 Regal GS is an excellent touring car, and I’d be more than happy taking it on long trips to utilize its ride quality, quiet cabin and cargo room. Now, if Buick could reach over to the Cadillac side of GM to borrow one of those twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engines from the CT6 with maximum torque coming at 2,500 rpm for the Buick Regal, I’d travel back to Atlanta — or anywhere else — to take a peek.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Posted on 10/23/2002\nVehicle Overview\nLike the related Century, Buicks midsize front-wheel-drive (FWD) Regal wont get a redesign for another year or so. For the 2003 model year, antilock brakes and side-impact airbags will be part of an option package rather than offered as standard equipment.\n\nTwo new body colors are available. Additional interior trim padding has been installed in the Regal to enhance head-impact protection. Special Regal models with color and trim by fashion designer Joseph Abboud will still be marketed.\n\nWith its front bucket seats, the Regal is sportier in appearance than the conservatively styled Century, which is equipped with a front bench seat. Both models are built from the same basic design. The Regal offers stronger engines and a racier personality. The Regal comes in base LS trim and performance-oriented GS guise; the GS is equipped with a supercharged engine.\n\nExterior\nThe Regal displays a more aggressive appearance than the comparably sized Century. The Regal has a bolder grille and different rear styling. Both models share the same FWD chassis and have 109-inch wheelbases. Measuring 196.2 inches long overall, the Regal is a little longer than the Century.\n\nThe LS sedan rides on 15-inch tires, and the GS carries wider rubber on 16-inch aluminum wheels. The GS also features a Gran Touring suspension for tauter handling. Abboud-styled sedans have lower bodyside cladding. A power moonroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats are standard in both versions of the Regal, whereas the Century comes with a front bench. A split, folding rear seatback augments the trunk, which has a 16.7-cubic-foot capacity and allows carrying long items such as skis. Standard LS fare includes a cassette player, remote keyless entry, cruise control, fog lamps, a tilt steering wheel, and power windows, door locks and mirrors. Dual-zone ComfortTemp air conditioning has separate controls for the driver and front passenger.\n\nIn addition to larger wheels and a supercharged engine, the GS edition adds leather-trimmed seats, a cassette and CD player, and a Driver Information Center. GMs OnStar communication system is a factory-installed option for both versions. Special club-style front bucket seats with Chestnut leather seating areas, which are reminiscent of those in Buicks LaCrosse concept vehicle, go into the Joseph Abboud special edition.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 200-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine goes into the LS, and the GS benefits from a supercharged version that develops 240 hp. Compared to most of its rivals, thats enough to turn the Regal into a virtual four-door hot rod thats capable of challenging some sports cars. Premium fuel is required for the supercharged engine. Both engines mate with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on the GS and an option on the LS. The GS models include a seat-mounted side-impact airbag for the driver and full-range traction control.\n\nDriving Inpressions\nThe GS isnt quite as refined as some import-brand rivals, but it is a potent road machine. Its acceleration falls short of stunning, but the Regals overall performance stands well above the midsize norm. Even with the Gran Touring suspension, its handling skills cant match those of a sports car, but the Regal can hold its own through curvy, demanding roads.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe basic design of the sporty Regal is similar to that of Buicks conservatively styled Century. Buick markets the midsize Regal sedan to younger buyers, while the Century tends to be favored by an older crowd. The Regal offers stronger engines, front bucket seats and a racier personality. The Regal comes in basic LS trim and performance-oriented GS guise, the latter of which packs a supercharged engine.\n\nFor 2002, a new Joseph Abboud special edition is offered in both LS and GS trims. This is the third model to come out of Buicks partnership with the renowned fashion designer. The Abboud models feature special club-style front bucket seats with Chestnut leather seating areas that are reminiscent of those in Buicks LaCrosse concept vehicle. LATCH child-seat tethers are new for 2002, but little else has changed.\n\nExterior\nThe Regal displays a more aggressive appearance than the similar-sized Century and is led by a bolder grille and different rear styling. Both models share the same front-drive chassis and have 109-inch wheelbases. Measuring 196.2 inches long overall, the Regal is a little longer than the Century, but their widths and heights are identical at 72.7 inches and 56.6 inches, respectively. The LS sedan rides on 15-inch tires, while the GS carries wider rubber on 16-inch aluminum wheels. The LS also features a Gran Touring suspension for tauter handling.\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats are standard in both versions of the Regal, while the Century comes with a front bench. A split, folding rear seatback augments the trunk, which has a 16.7-cubic-foot capacity and allows carrying long items such as skis. Standard LS fare includes a cassette player, remote keyless entry, cruise control, fog lamps, a tire-inflation monitor, a tilt steering wheel, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Dual-zone ComfortTemp air conditioning has separate controls for the driver and front passenger.\n\nIn addition to bigger wheels and a supercharged engine, the GS edition adds leather-trimmed seats, a cassette/CD player and a Driver Information Center. GMs satellite-based OnStar communication system is standard in the GS and comes as a factory-installed option in the LS sedan.\n\nThe Joseph Abboud special edition features a premium audio system, sunroof and steering-wheel stereo controls. Late in the 2001 model year, Tortoise Burl woodgrain trim went on the Regals door switches and gearshift lever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 200-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine goes into the LS, while the GS benefits from a supercharged version that develops 240 hp. Thats enough to turn the Regal into a virtual four-door hot rod  compared to most of its rivals  that is capable of challenging some sports cars. Premium fuel is required for the supercharged engine. Both engines mate with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nCompared to some midsize sedans, the Regal offers a good selection of standard safety features, including all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and a theft-deterrent system. Models with leather upholstery include a seat-mounted side-impact airbag for the driver.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough the GS isnt quite as refined as some import-brand rivals, it is a potent road machine. Acceleration falls short of stunning, but overall performance stands well above the midsize norm. Even with the Gran Touring suspension, handling skills cannot match those of a sports car, but the Regal can hold its own through curvy, demanding roads.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "We left New York City via the Lincoln Tunnel on a Sunday evening threatened by rain. The circumstances brought forth the worst in drivers. People were in a mood to crash.\n\nMotorists jockeyed for position at the tunnel’s entrance, squeezing out the more timid rivals among them, or taking advantage of those naive enough to believe that laws governed the traffic’s movement.\n\nIt would have been good to be in an intimidator-mobile, something brutishly big and ugly. Bullies respect power. But ours was one of Middle America’s favorite chariots — the 2001 Buick Regal GS Olympic Edition. Even worse, it was metallic gold and affixed with Michigan license plates.\n\nNobody respects Michigan in New York, and everybody knows that Buicks and road rage don’t mix. At least it seemed that way. So many people drove at us and cut us off, we felt like crash-test dummies. Some motorists appeared to be laughing as they nudged our rear bumper. But all of that ended after we exited the tunnel.\n\nWe didn’t fight back. We ran — fast.\n\nThe Regal GS is equipped with one of the best internal-combustion engines available, the 3800 SFI Series II supercharged V-6, which develops 240 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute. The supercharger is a pump that packs more air into the engine’s combustion chambers, creating a denser, more powerful air-fuel mix. It effectively turns a family carrier into a high-performance car.\n\nAnd so we ran, trying to stay away from the bumper bandits without falling into the hands of the police. We continued this high-speed balancing act until the rain came.\n\nUnfortunately, though, it was more mist than rain. Mist is bad stuff. It obscures vision and clings to the road, where it mixes with oils to create the practical equivalent of a skid pad. It’s hard to keep your grip on a skid pad, even at slower highway speeds of 55 to 60 mph. I was the driver at that point. I almost lost it.\n\nIt was a lane-change thing. I tried to move to the center lane from the right lane to evade an 18-wheeler crowding my rear. I signaled my intentions and visually checked for center space, but apparently I didn’t check well enough. What appeared to be a Mazda Miata roadster sped up the center out of the mist.\n\nI stomped on the Regal GS’s brake pedal. Power anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes are standard on this front-wheel-drive car. I stayed on the brakes as they went through their automatic pumping routine, electronically apportioning enough braking pressure to slow the car without locking its wheels.\n\nI didn’t hit the Miata, but I went into a skid for what appeared to be forever. The Regal GS was headed toward that right-lane truck, and I thought: This is how people die on the road. I also remembered recent driving instructions — to look for an escape route, to look away from the object you are in danger of hitting and try to steer around it. Luckily, enough space opened up at the right time in the center lane for me to successfully execute that maneuver.\n\nThe Regal GS’s body yawed more than I liked during that frightening event. But it was was ultimately controllable. Credit here goes to the General Motors Corp. engineers who designed a four-wheel independent suspension system capable of handling radical weight transfers in a midsize car of 3,543 pounds. The car’s traction-control system, in conjunction with good 16-inch tires, also helped.\n\nI don’t know how the Regal GS’s dual front and side air bags would have functioned, and frankly, having escaped the crash, I have no regrets about that ignorance. Happiness is not getting hit. But the seat belts worked for me and my front-seat passenger, grabbing us and holding us firmly in place during braking and skidding.\n\nI have an idea of how things might have turned out had we not buckled up, but it’s too scary to contemplate. All I know is that the ne time I drive away from New York, I’m departing by way of the George Washington Bridge — and in good weather.",

      "expert_review": "If you haven’t visited a Buick dealer in a bit, you might be a little surprised at the vehicles General Motors’ luxury-car division has in its lineup.\n\nThe big, bloated soft-riding Buick road monsters of the past have given way to smaller cars with cleaner designs, sharper performance, greater comfort, better handling, and, most importantly, higher quality and more value for the dollar.\n\nBuick has received a complete make-over in the last two years. And now many of its cars are real headturners. It’s as if Buick visited Jenny Craig; the GM division went in as Nell Carter and came out looking like Whitney Houston.\n\nLet’s say you would like a luxurious, sporty sedan – one that doesn’t punish you with a stiff ride, and one that doesn’t resemble some outrageous race car. Also, you’d like to keep the price in the mid-$20s. You would be hard pressed to find a similar-size vehicle with the same level of equipment and performance as the Buick Regal GS, this week’s test car.\n\nThe supercharged sedan is a quick, refined, smooth-riding mid-size car aimed at middle-aged drivers who like civilized performance.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Regal is the Buick that carries the performance torch for the brand. Starting back in 1978 when Buick offered a turbocharged V-6 Regal, there have been some impressive performance-oriented Regals through the years, including the now-classic Grand National and GNX models of the mid-’80s.\n\nWith its powerful supercharged 3.8-liter V-6 engine, there is no doubt the new Regal GS is worthy of the name. Rated at a robust 240 horsepower, the engine in the Regal GS delivers ample thrust when your right foot presses the accelerator. But the power is delivered in traditional Buick fashion – quietly and with finesse.\n\nThe engine makes barely a whisper as the supercharger blasts a denser mix of fuel and air into the engine. The Regal GS is reasonably quick from a stop, but it really delivers strong acceleration from 20 mph all the way to about 80 mph. The front wheels, which drive the car, exhibit no trace of torque steer, a slight pulling to the left or right. This is a common malady exhibited by high-performance front-wheel-drive cars, but it is undetectable on the Regal.\n\nThe Regal is outfitted with GM’s heavy-duty 4T65E electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission – perhaps the best automatic gearbox in any car. The driver can press a button on the shifter that changes the shift timing to the performance mode. This makes the shifts a bit more abrupt, because the engine revs slightly higher before each gear change. In combined city/highway driving, our test car returned 22 1/2 miles per gallon, not bad for a high-performance machine.\n\nAll Regals are built with a very compliant four-wheel independent suspension system. Extreme body rigidity is perhaps the greatest reason the suspension system works so well. Buick’s engineers stiffened the Regal’s bod y by about 40 percent over the1996 model. Many of the body panels now are larger, one-piece components, which eliminates many welds and seams. That, in turn, reduces rattles and squeaks and enhances the stiffness of the body.\n\nYou can feel how well Buick did if you drive the Regal over a rough road, such as a brick-paved street or a dirt road. The suspension system absorbs the energy of the bumps without transferring any of the jarring through the steering wheel or to the interior. In other words, the Regal remains poised, easy to control and very quiet when the going gets rough.\n\nAlthough the suspension is softer than you might expect in a sporty sedan, the Regal competently handled cornering chores. There was a slight bit of body roll when I took a curve quickly, but not enough to have much of an impact on the stability of the car. The power-assisted rack-and pinion steering system worked smoothly but felt somewhat heavy. However, the power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes were excellent. The anti-lock system engaged smoothly and worked quietly without much pulsing in the pedal.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nBuick and the rest of GM suffered during the last 20 years because the company’s interior designers didn’t get the details right. Seats were uncomfortable; dashes were ugly; ergonomics were bad. The Regal is further proof that GM’s interior decorators learned from their mistakes. If your idea of a smartly designed interior includes things such as stylish gauges, excellent seats, easy-to-reach and use controls, good visibility and tasteful trim, you’ll like the Regal.\n\nAlthough the Regal comes with some high-tech items, such as a dual zone air conditioner, sophisticated radio and programmable door locks, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to learn how these things work. In fact, the Regal is one of those cars in which you immediately feel at home. The interior, with its faux wood trim, has a warm ambience. You settle into the leather-covered driver’s bucket seat and feel comfortable with the size and layout of the interior.\n\nBecause the new Regal rides on a slightly longer wheelbase than last year’s car, the interior is a bit bigger, offering more head, leg and foot room, front and rear. I found the dimensions of the new car to be excellent. It’s neither too big nor too small. Four adults can fit inside comfortably, though there’s room for a fifth.\n\nAs you would expect from Buick, the Regal GS has nearly every power accessory, such as power seats, mirrors, windows, door locks, cruise control and rear defroster. A secondary set of controls for the radio is located on the steering wheel, so changing stations or volume is as simple as moving a finger.\n\nThe new Regal is a solid mid-size entry-level luxury car that offers more horsepower and equipment than you’ll find on most imported entry-level sporty luxury sedans.\n\nAlong with the new Century, LeSabre and Riviera, the 1997 1/2 Regal should prove to be a solid competitor, one you would be hard-pressed to fault.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $22,945. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $25,630. EPA rating: 18 mpg city/28 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The all-new Regal is the best one yet. It offers an excellent combination of room, performance, luxury features and style for a very attractive price.",

      "expert_review": "One of the better family- oriented offering’s from Buick Motor Division these days is the 1995 Buick Regal. As a premier mid-sized sedan or coupe, the Regal’s availability runs from Custom to Gran Sport models, with an eye to providing something for everybody.\n\nFor those with a taste for a bit of upstream motoring without bankrupting the family treasury, there is the Regal Limited sedan. This automobile can almost go head-to-head with most of the accouterments found in General Motors’ more expensive cars.\n\nFor ’95, Buick put its designers to work to develop a new interior for all models. The exterior lines have been freshened a bit. And there are numerous comfort, convenience and safety updates.\n\nIt has resulted in a better-class mid-sized motor car that is a blend of performance and utilitarian service in a medium price range. The Regal is not as luxurious as the Cadillac or as fast as the Corvette, but it fits in between those two models quite well as an all-purpose sedan.\n\nIn driving the ’95 Regal Limited that GM’s Terri Phillips provided for a test car, I was struck not by what a difference a day makes but by what a difference an all-new interior makes.\n\nBuick apparently put itself in the driver’s seat on this one, as the division has made a quantum leap forward in improving its previously archaic instrumentation and controls layout.\n\nNow easy-to-read analog gauges are directly in front of the driver, instead of being crammed into a narrow confine. And the power window switches are mounted on the forward section of the door’s armrest rather than being positioned at a rather awkward angle on the door itself.\n\nMost all controls lie virtually within fingertip distance of the steering wheel, and were easily accessible while driving. If we had a gripe about anything, it would be that the ignition switch sort of disappears at night after the delayed interior lighting goes out. Of course, you can always turn on the interior lights to find the thing.\n\nAs a fail-safe piece of family transportation, there wasn’t much more to do than to put it in gear and steer. The transmission of choice — the only one offered — was a smooth- shifting, electronically controlled four-speed automatic.\n\nIt now uses a new Dexron III transmission fluid that Buick says doesn’t require a fluid change for 100,000 miles under normal operating conditions. The fluid also offers a more stable shift feel under extreme conditions.\n\nBuick doesn’t offer a five-speed manual gearbox, which make me wonder why bother with a tachometer in the instrument panel. But then it sure does look impressive.\n\nOne feature about the Regal Limited that is well worth considering is that the standard engine is Buick’s 3800 V-6 instead of its smaller 3.1-liter V-6. This 231-cubic inch motor puts out 170-horsepower, and more importantly for acceleration purposes 225 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe V-6 is pretty much state-of-the-art, two valves per cylinder rocker arm technology that has been ref ined to where it will run forever, given proper maintenance. And the torque made itself felt when you gave it full throttle for a quick pass.\n\nUnless you looked under the hood, you would never know there wasn’t a V-8 lurking there. Down the interstate, the sedan just sailed along without effort.\n\nBuick sedans are not noted for being designed as road-racing vehicles, but this doesn’t mean they have to fall all over themselves going through fast turns.\n\nThe test car certainly didn’t, courtesy of a Gran Touring suspension system that seemed to hit a very happy compromise between ride and control. The Touring system firmed up the ride just enough to give a little extra feel for the road, but without making the ride stiff. It gave a certain enhancement of control to the car’s front-wheel drive.\n\nThis is, however, a $745 option. That puts it in the category of which need comes first, highspeed control or cost of the product.\n\nThe Limited is rated as a five-passenger auto mobile based on a 2/3 front/rear carrying capacity. Interior room in front is excellent and quite ample in the back seat.\n\nThe way the rear seat cushions are contoured, I’d say two people are going to be more comfortable riding any distance than three. But in the Limited, there was a minimum of 36.2 inches of rear leg room, and that is quite sufficient for passengers to sit comfortably.\n\nIn the driver’s compartment, there were a lot of standard touches, that while not entirely new, certainly added to the convenience of driving.\n\nAn example of this is the radio controls on the steering wheel.\n\nThen I think the ladies will like the fact that all the doors automatically lock when the car is put into gear. And unlike some systems where they unlock when the shift lever is moved to park, with this car they stayed locked until the ignition switch was turned off.\n\nWhile the Limited is a couple of thousand dollars upstream in price from the Buick Custom sedan, considering that there are a number of equipment items that are standard in the Limited it makes it a model well worth considering in the mid-sized range.\n\n1995 Buick Regal Limited Base price: $21,235As tested: $24,415Type: Front engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger, mid-sized sedanEngine: 3.8-liters, OHV V-6, 12 valves, fuel-injected, 170-horsepower, 225 foot-pounds of torqueTransmission: Four-speed automaticMileage: 19 mpg city/29 mpg highwayAcceleration: 0-60 mph in 8.0 secondsWheelbase: 107.5 inchesLength: 193.7 inchesWidth: 72.5 inchesHeight: 54.5 inchesCurb weight: 3,463 poundsOptions: Prestige option package, premium stereo/w compact disc, Gran Touring suspension, leather/vinyl bucket seats",

      "expert_review": "The GS is a Regal with an attitude, thanks to 240 supercharged horsepower and a suspension tuned for athletic handling.\n\nThis five-passenger sedan, which starts at $23,890, is a sports sedan for the mature adult who wants above-average performance at a reasonable price. The list of standard equipment includes items such as traction control, anti-lock brakes and leather seats. The test car was black with dark-gray lower-body cladding, set off by chrome 16-inch wheels. The look is subtle, the effect understated.\n\nThe Regal shares its basic platform with other GM products such as the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Pontiac Grand Prix, although it has its own personality. The wheelbase has been stretched to 109 inches, which creates more room inside.\n\nBuick says the new body has a built-in safety cage for occupant protection. The ride is not as firm as the Grand Prix or as supple as the Intrigue. The benefits of a tight, strong body structure show up in a compliant ride and a lack of squeaks because engineers can tune the suspension to soak up bumps without having to compensate for the body flexing. Consequently, the Regal GS has responsive handling without a rough ride.\n\nThe supercharged, 3.8-liter V6 has the throttle response of a small V8. The only penalty for the extra power is extra sound and a few tingles that can be felt through the steering wheel full throttle. By mounting the engine on a separate cradle isolated from the body with rubber mounts, engineers were able to keep noise and vibration from making its way into the cabin. The Buick’s level of noise and vibration, however, seems to be less than in its sister car, the Pontiac Grand Prix.\n\nGetting this kind of power to the ground through the front wheels can be tricky, and occasionally they wiggle and fight for traction when you floor it. Traction control is a blessing, especially in bad weather.\n\nSafety equipment includes dual airbags and side-impact protection.\n\nOnce inside, the light-gray leather seats have vertical seams for comfort, and side bolsters large enough to give lateral support but not big enough to make it hard to get in. Buick’s seats are a source of pride to the company, and these continue that tradition. Longer seat tracks increase the amount of fore and aft travel.\n\nInstruments are legible dial gauges. The trip computer consists of a digital readout in the lower section of the tachometer. The radio is located up high in the center of the dash where it is easy to reach. This is a new unit, but some of its switches are still quite tiny. Soft-touch, remote radio controls are nicely integrated into the wheel where they can be used without the driver ever having to take her hands from the wheel.\n\nThe optional dual-zone heating/cooling system has push buttons instead of rotary-type dials.\n\nThe additional length of the wheelbase, along with sculpted backs of the front seats, improves rear-seat knee room. A lockable pass-thro ugh to the trunk is good for skis or other long things. An integrated child seat is available. Some back-seat passengers might find that the seat tips back too far, making it uncomfortable on long trips.\n\nWhile the GS is not for everyone, its strong acceleration, comfortable leather seats and long list of standard equipment makes it quite competitive with the other cars in its segment.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $23,890. Options included 6-way power passenger seat, dual-zone air conditioning, steering wheel radio controls, compact disc player and chrome wheels.\n\nThe sticker price was $25,805.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Regal GS is a mature sports sedan that has a lot of standard equipment, a reasonable price and lots of power under your foot. In addition, it feels tight a is bigger inside.\n\nCounterpoint: The interior design has been improved over the old model, but there is room for further refinement in terms of how easy secondary controls are to use.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.8-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 109 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,520 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $23,890\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $25,805\n\nMPG RATING: 17 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "We all know that when it comes to the say about buying cars, women rule the roost.\n\nIf you think this only applies to married guys, guess again.\n\nWhen you’re single, the car you drive says a lot about you as a person. And guys, always trying to figure out and impress the fair sex, listen to what they have to say.\n\nThis is what a friend’s sister said about the Buick Regal Grand Sport: “That is a real Harry Highpants kind of car.”\n\nOuch.\n\nMaybe it is, but this is the car that’s supposed to attract a new younger buyer to Buick. I enjoyed this car, but the minute she said it, I checked my chest to see if it had disappeared yet.\n\nNope, the chest is still there. So what makes this car seem so fuddy-duddy?\n\nBeats me.\n\nThe styling is conservative to be sure, but so is most sedan design these days. The exterior is devoid of chrome, the tires wide, the wheels aluminum. It looks as mean as this car could look. Just make sure you order your Regal in GS, rather than chrome-laden LS trim.\n\nOrdering the GS also gets you a firmer suspension and GM’s supercharged version of the 3800 V-6 engine. This powerplant sees duty in the two-sizes-larger Park Avenue, so the 240 horsepower that it produces makes this car move quickly. No, make that very quickly.\n\nThe four-speed electronic automatic clicks off the shifts smoothly. GM thoughtfully equipped it with a performance mode, where downshifts occur even more quickly than they normally would. So you can leave your girlfriend’s Honda in the dust, if you so desire.\n\nAll that power uses fuel at a rate of 20 mpg in mixed driving. This engine requires premium fuel.\n\nThe Regal shares its platform with the Century, Oldsmobile Intrigue and Pontiac Grand Prix. Only the Grand Prix is lighter. While the Olds feels more alive at highway speed, the Buick is a lot stronger off the line and in around-town situations. The Buick also has the softest ride of the three, but it’s not overly soft.\n\nThe steering has been revised, although it felt similar to last year’s, having quite a bit of power boost. But it is fairly quick.\n\nHandling isn’t quite as good as the power. Most maneuvers are handled with ease, although there is a bit of body lean. Trying to hustle this car like a BMW will only yield screaming tires and a screaming girlfriend. (Probably saying something about how much older you seem to be.)\n\nThe four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock are good and the addition of traction control is a reassuring touch. Front heated seats are available as an option.\n\nSpace up front is good, with large bucket seats that are comfy for long-distance cruising. The rear seat has about the space and accommodations you would expect. The leather-trimmed interior gave the car an appropriate air for a Buick.\n\nRoad and tire noise seemed a little intrusive.\n\nThe dash is nicely designed in the current Buick idiom, a sweeping curve that gracefully mimics the coke bottle beltline of the exterior. It f unctions well, with solid-feeling switch gear.\n\nThe radio is typical GM, with good sound and easy to understand controls. The optional electronic climate control is the same one used in other Buicks. The difference here is the optional steering-wheel mounted controls have no adjustment for the climate control as it is in other Buicks. There are only switches for the audio system.\n\nBut the center console is improved from last year. A storage bin door now has a handle grip, so that it no longer pinches fingers when opening it.\n\nThe trunk has good space, all of it usable, as the trunk’s hinges don’t interfere with cargo space.\n\nSo go ahead and laugh at Harry Highpants. But you won’t be able to catch him.\n\n>> 1999 Buick Regal GS\n\nEngine: 3.8 OHV V6\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nTires: 225/60R16\n\nStandard: Four-wheel-disc anti-lock brakes, traction control, tilt steering wheel, Gran Touring suspension, dual air-conditioning with air-filtration, fog lamps, AM/FM Cassette, remote heated side mirrors, rear seat pass-through, power door locks, power windows, auxiliary power outlet, intermittent wipers, electronic information center.\n\nOptions: Heated seats, Luxury Package (Electronic dual zone climate control, electrochromatic rearview mirrors, steering-wheel-mounted radio controls, upgraded stereo)\n\nBase price: $24,395\n\nAs tested: $25,800\n\nEPA rating: 18 mpg city, 27 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 20.7 mpg >>",

      "expert_review": "THE CAR came without gold chains and an open-collar shirt, or a black leather jacket or dark glasses. It also came without the classic male, middle-age paunch. But everything about it said crisis-time, gotta-shake-these-near-50-still-owe-tuition- can’t-afford-a-Porsche blues.\n\nThe 1996 Buick Regal Gran Sport sedan. That’s “Gran” without the “d” — a spelling engineered to give the car more panache. Note the difference between the sound of “Grand” and “Gran.” The d-less “Grand” sounds more sensuous, don’t you think?\n\nAnyway, the test model was black on black with a blacked-out grille and highly polished chrome wheels beneath silver rocker panels — the paneling below the doors of an automobile. It obviously came from the Oakland Raiders School of Design, which was cool, considering the Regal Gran Sport’s intended market.\n\nTo put it kindly, that market is the plateau of American manhood — that psycho-economic flat spot that finds many men not quite failures, not quite successes, but still struggling to add zoom to an extraordinarily ordinary life.\n\nAnd the Regal Gran Sport does just that. The thing can kick butt, which is also cool, as long as that butt isn’t wearing a state trooper’s uniform and sitting inside a big Chevrolet Caprice with flashing lights.\n\nBackground: The Gran Sport sedan is a Buick Regal on testosterone — a deliberately male-oriented machine designed to change from family hauler to hot-rod as soon as it clears the driveway sans spouse, kids and family pets. Buick’s marketers say as much, and the Gran Sport lives up to that billing.\n\nThat’s the problem. As a symbol, the Gran Sport is dreadfully transparent. It allows people to see right through you. Example: A woman in a Northern Virginia shopping mall saw me getting out of the Gran Sport and said: “I guess that’s your toy, huh?” She then smiled and shook her head as if to say: “Don’t worry, honey. You’ll get over it.” I was devastated.\n\nWhat the heck? The Gran Sport is equipped with an extensively revised version of General Motors Corp.’s trusty 3.8-liter V-6 called the 3800 Series II V-6. The new engine is rated 205 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 35 horsepower more than the previous model. Max torque is set at 230 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm.\n\nThe Gran Sport’s suspension has been tweaked to give it a more sporty feel than lesser Regals. But it also shares much with its softer siblings, including front-wheel-drive, standard dual-front air bags, air conditioning, power four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock backup and an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe other Regals include the Custom, the most affordable version; and the Limited, the luxury model. All Regals are available as sedans or coupes.\n\nComplaints: The feel of it, which was something like being trapped in an eternal run of “Saturday Night Fever” with John Travolta.\n\nPraise: Mechanically, the Regal Gran Sport sedan is aces. It has substantially more oomph than say, your everyday “Japanese Chevrolet” — otherwise known as the Toyota Camry.\n\nHead-turning quotient: A motorized leisure suit — superbly stitched, but decidedly out of date.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and handling — in fact, unbelievably good for a car that began life in 1973 as a run-of-the-mill family mobile. Excellent acceleration in terms of highway lane-change competence. Excellent braking.\n\nMileage: About 25 miles per gallon (estimated 409-mile range on usable volume of recommended regular unleaded gasoline), running mostly highway and driver only.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with console-mounted, single-CD disc changer, Concert Sound II speakers, by GM/Delco. Excellent off-the-shelf factory sound. You want better? Spend more money or just go to the danged concert.\n\nPrice: Base Regal price is $21,800. Estimated dealer invoice on base Regal is $18, 80. Add $2,382 for “Gran Sport options package,” including the 3800 Series II V-6. Tack on another $540 for destination charge. Price as tested is $24,722.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Gran Sport has one of the best engines of any car in the mid-size category. It’s far more fun than driving a Camry, Honda Accord, Chrysler Concorde or, for that matter, Ford’s 1996 Taurus. If only Buick could do something about the Gran Sport’s styling.",

      "expert_review": "Rather than promote high speed or low price, Buick has hammered home the top-quality message and, as a result, the midsize Regal continues to be one ofthe more desirable vehicles on the market.\n\nWe test-drove the 1993 Gran Sport SE sedan, the performance version of the midsize Regal family.\n\nDespite the performance tag, it’s not the fastest car around. It’s not meant to be, even though the standard 3.8-liter, 170-horsepower, V-6 engine teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission has more than ample ability toscoot down the expressway and quickly match or surpass the flow of traffic.\n\nThe 19 m.p.g. city/28 highway mileage is a pleasant surprise for a car thatcan seat five people and boasts a trunk that can handle their luggage, golf clubs or groceries.\n\nThe car’s Gran Touring suspension is a combination of luxury soft and sports-car firm to provide just the right amount of cushion over bumps and theproper stiffness in sharp corners and turns so that the car and occupants sit flat and in control of the pavement. With that suspension, the Regal Gran Sport takes on the flavor of a Pontiac Grand Prix or Bonneville.\n\nBut neither the road-conscious suspension nor an aggressive yet mileage-sensitive V-6 are what makes the Gran Sport a bit special.\n\nThe seats set the car apart from its brethren. They are roomy, comfortable and supportive, without the air-filled bladders used in the seats of some carsof Buick’s General Motors sister divisions, such as Chevrolet, which concentrates more on pump-’em-up bucket seats than on pumping up sagging sales.\n\nRegal is the first beneficiary of a new development in seat design that focuses on matching the orthopedic contour of the body. Computers, not ex-contortionists, designed the seats, ensuring a comfortable fit for short and tall, male and female drivers.\n\nThe front end of the seat cushion is rounded to relieve pressure on the backs of the legs of short drivers. Take a look at the seats in your car. Chances are the front end of the seat cushion is raised slightly.\n\nAlso, backrests have been reshaped to provide more support and avoid lower-back pain for all drivers, regardless of height.\n\nChances are there is a rather large gap between your lower back and the seat-back cushion in your car. No cushion, no support. To make up for the discomfort, motorists tend to lean their shoulders and upper body forward to force the lower back to make contact with the seat cushion. That hardly makes for the proper position for long-distance travel or aggressive driving when the need or feeling arises.\n\nKudos and a tip of the hat to the folks from Buick.\n\nWe hope, however, that when taking bows, they will work enough oxygen back up into the cranium to give them the energy to correct the car’s few flaws.\n\nFor starters, our test car came with those automatic door locks that engageonce you put the lever in gear and don’t release until you push the unlock button. We favor automatic locks that engage when you put the car in gear and automatically unlock when you put the lever in park or stop the car and grab the handle to exit.\n\nWe realize some folks prefer those sealed-as-in-a-cell-type locks for addedprotection. Fine. To each his or her own. Our gripe is that you should have a choice of power locks so that you can exit speedily upon arrival at your destination or take a few extra seconds and press the button yourself.\n\nA big plus is the optional remote, keyless entry system. You merely touch the symbol on the key fob to lock or unlock the doors or the trunk after you’ve left the vehicle or as you approach with an armload of groceries. In today’s world, in which parking lots have in some cases been transformed into danger zones, that’s one system you definitely should consider for your next car.\n\nA gripe was that the heating system took an unusually long time to warm thefeet. Twin daughter No. 1 suggested that perhaps it was just old age having aneffect on our circulatory system, a comment that resulted in a definite changein her ability to circulate for the next few weeks. Regardless of how we fiddled with the controls, the upper body was toasting while the toes were still defrosting.\n\nTwo words of warning: Take a pass on the optional leather and vinyl seats ($500), which are a bit cool in winter and can feel like the top of a stove insummer.\n\nAnd please join us in chastising Buick for offering but a single pop-out cupholder in the Gran Sport console. The unit adjusts to a variety of cup sizes if pressed in on the sides-but not so easily that you feel confident theholder and the cup make for a snug fit.\n\nBuick hasn’t promoted Regal as its cheapest car, and for good reason. The Gran Sport we drove starts at $19,310. The SE option package added $1,935 and included power windows with driver’s express down; power seats; electronic cruise control; electric rear-window defogger; dual electric remote mirrors; dual air-conditioning controls; power antenna; convenience trunk net; dual visor mirrors; and keyless entry.\n\nSteering-wheel radio controls added $125 and a compact-disc player $124.\n\nWe would prefer the car offered an air bag, rather than radio controls, in the steering column. In the event of a collision, seek and scan are hardly priorities.\n\nStandard equipment includes anti-lock brakes; air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with digital clock; tilt steering; 16-inch, steel-belted, all-season radial tires; power door locks; power brakes and steering; extendable sun visors; and side-window defoggers.",

      "expert_review": "A year into its rebirth, the Buick Regal adds two versions for 2012. The mild-hybrid Regal eAssist is EPA-rated at 36 mpg on the highway, while the Regal GS reincarnates Buick’s Gran Sport performance label in a car with 270 horsepower and a manual transmission. I evaluated both, and I’ve also driven the mainstream, four-cylinder Regal. Compare all these versions and the 220-hp Regal turbo here.\n\nBoth new trims should expand the car’s draw, but neither one is a slam dunk.\n\nThe 2012 Buick Regal GS could be more fun, while the eAssist has drivetrain gremlins that need ironing out. And below-average reliability hurts its case.\n\nThis review focuses on the eAssist and the GS. For an overview of the regular Regal, read our evaluation of the 2011 model here, or compare the 2011 and 2012 Regal here.\n\nRegal eAssist\nGM’s mild-hybrid eAssist system supplants the conventional alternator to add 15 hp under hard acceleration, but it doesn’t feel much different from the base four-cylinder Regal. Both cars are sluggish in the passing lane, and the eAssist’s tepid initial accelerator response vexed me. More concerning was the drivetrain’s tendency to lurch or clunk at low speeds, whether starting off or slowing down.\n\nIf anything, eAssist should provide smoother acceleration than most hybrids, as the gasoline engine stays on full-time, eliminating the electric-to-gas transition that gives many hybrids their characteristic stair-stepped starts. Instead, the Regal eAssist replaces the stair-step routine with shudders and clunks. On your test drive, note how the drivetrain behaves at low speeds, then click the email link at the end of this review to send me your assessment.\n\nThe eAssist system allows the engine to shut off during certain coasting or braking situations, and, like all hybrids and some conventional cars, it employs regenerative braking and automatic shutoffs at idle. Regenerative brakes that feel natural are a rare find, but the Regal eAssist does well for what it is. The pedal’s a bit mushy at first, but it gets linear farther down.\n\nThe eAssist’s taut ride quality shows the nameplate’s Opel roots — Opel is a GM division in Europe, Buick is a GM division in the U.S. — but its mushy handling falls short. The steering is sharp, but other aspects disappoint. Put the Regal eAssist hard into a corner, and it pitches off-balance as the nose pushes free. Hit a midcorner bump, and the wheels dance outward. A driver’s car, this is not.\n\nPut it all together, and the Regal eAssist delivers an EPA-rated 25/36 mpg city/highway. That’s far better than other trims, which range from 18/29 mpg to 20/32 mpg, so the eAssist’s $2,000 extra cost versus a normally aspirated Regal will recoup itself in reasonable time. All the Regal’s engines run fine on regular gas, but Buick recommends premium to get maximum performance out of the Regal Turbo and GS.\n\nBuick’s devotion to eAssist is clear: The company has announced it will become the standard drivetrain for 2013, eliminating the 2.4-liter four-cylinder. Pricing isn’t yet available.\n\nPerformance Lite\nCourtesy of a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder, the Regal GS packs some heat, but it’s more chipotle than habanero. Endemic of yesteryear’s pint-sized turbo engines, the GS pulls hard only as the tach needle swings past 3,000 rpm. Some of today’s best engines, like the Audi A4 and BMW’s 2012 328i, have plenty of gusto right off the line. Buick claims a hardy 295 pounds-feet of torque at 2,400 rpm, the sort of low-end push that ought to pin you back in your seat. I felt no such excitement, but I do give kudos to the six-speed manual transmission, whose medium throws, precise gates and light clutch are worth spreading to other GM cars. A six-speed automatic will be a no-cost option.\n\nBuick claims the Regal GS makes it to 60 mph in a modest 6.7 seconds. That puts the GS, which has front-wheel drive like other Regals, well short of the all-wheel-drive Regal GS concept car that was shown at the 2010 Detroit auto show. That one was claimed to hit 60 in less than six seconds. As power builds, it comes on in spurts, leaving the tires spinning for traction at higher speeds. Hit the engine’s stride midcorner, and the nose readily pushes wide. Sweeping curves have the Regal GS’ tail sliding out eventually, and the car’s lifelike steering feedback aids the process. The car handles well, but I wish the drivetrain were up to similar snuff.\n\nBuick’s Interactive Drive Control, optional on the Regal Turbo and standard on the GS, adds an adaptive suspension. In the GS, it has regular, Sport and GS settings. The Regal Turbo gets regular, Touring and Sport settings. In the Regal GS, GS mode reduces power-steering assist and stiffens the suspension, but the differences in ride comfort are slim. GS mode improves steering feedback at higher speeds, but no matter the setting the wheel still turns with light effort around town. That’s something I prefer, though driving enthusiasts may want higher-effort steering.\n\nTypical of Buick, road and wind noise are low, but the GS’ sport-tuned suspension gives it a firmer ride than is justified by its modest performance. The suspension isolates well enough on the highway, but potholes and other ruts toss you around, even using Drive Control’s softest settings. Our tester had optional 20-inch wheels and high-performance (summer) P255/35ZR20 tires. The GS’ standard 19-inchers and cushier P245/40R19 tires may improve ride comfort.\n\nThe Inside\nLast year’s review gives a full overview of the interior. Buick’s IntelliLink system, which will roll out in late-issue 2012s, incorporates smartphone applications like Pandora and Stitcher internet radio into a 7-inch dashboard screen. Bluetooth audio connectivity, iPod compatibility and steering-wheel audio controls are also standard.\n\nThe Regal’s center controls take some getting used to. Three knobs — one near the center armrest — control various functions on the dashboard display, which is also a touch-screen. Two of the knobs are redundant, but there are enough nearby functions that you don’t have to reach somewhere else to get something done. Sort through it all, and there’s plenty of functionality. Every navigation system should employ a directional joystick to scroll the map, for example, and Buick’s is in the minority that does.\n\nThe cabin has handsome materials but shoddy fittings. I let panel gaps slide unless they’re really unsightly — and from the glove compartment to the steering wheel hub, our Regal GS had more misfits than a season of “Jersey Shore.” Check out the photos. Buick has work to do.\n\nTrunk volume in most Regals measures 14.2 cubic feet, which is competitive with other entry-luxury sedans. It drops to 11.1 cubic feet in the Regal eAssist, whose lithium-ion battery sits behind the backseat, cutting space and reducing the standard folding backseat to a glorified pass-through. Still, that’s better than some hybrid sedans, whose backseats don’t fold at all.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top scores in front, side and rear crash tests, the Regal is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, plus front and head-protecting side airbags. Side-impact torso airbags for the rear seats are standard on the Regal GS and optional on other trim levels. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the Regal’s first year back, reliability was disappointing. It was below average in a league of reliable competitors: The Audi A4, Acura TSX and Infiniti G25 all have average or above-average reliability records. The Volkswagen CC is the sole competitor in Buick’s below-average camp.\n\nFor around $27,000, the Regal starts with dual-zone automatic climate control, heated leather upholstery and a power driver’s seat. Buick’s IntelliLink system, with its 7-inch touch-screen, will be standard beginning later in 2012. Options include a power passenger seat, a moonroof, Harman Kardon stereo, a navigation system, xenon headlights and upgraded engines — the eAssist, Turbo and GS turbo. Load up the Regal GS, and the price tops $38,000.\n\nRegal in the Market\nThe fastest-growing brand in 2010, Buick is still on a roll. In its first full year of sales, the Regal outsold the TSX, CC and A4. The GS and eAssist expand the car’s potential, but their execution falls short of a slam dunk. Both cars have strong foundations, and their issues could be remedied with an extensive refresh rather than a full redesign. I hope GM can right the ship and improve reliability, because the Regal has a lot going for it otherwise.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA year into its rebirth, the Buick Regal adds two versions for 2012. The mild-hybrid Regal eAssist is EPA-rated at 36 mpg on the highway, while the Regal GS reincarnates Buick’s Gran Sport performance label in a car with 270 horsepower and a manual transmission. I evaluated both, and I’ve also driven the mainstream, four-cylinder Regal. Compare all these versions and the 220-hp Regal turbo here.\n\nBoth new trims should expand the car’s draw, but neither one is a slam dunk.\n\nThe 2012 Buick Regal GS could be more fun, while the eAssist has drivetrain gremlins that need ironing out. And below-average reliability hurts its case.\n\nThis review focuses on the eAssist and the GS. For an overview of the regular Regal, read our evaluation of the 2011 model here, or compare the 2011 and 2012 Regal here.\n\nRegal eAssist\nGM’s mild-hybrid eAssist system supplants the conventional alternator to add 15 hp under hard acceleration, but it doesn’t feel much different from the base four-cylinder Regal. Both cars are sluggish in the passing lane, and the eAssist’s tepid initial accelerator response vexed me. More concerning was the drivetrain’s tendency to lurch or clunk at low speeds, whether starting off or slowing down.\n\nIf anything, eAssist should provide smoother acceleration than most hybrids, as the gasoline engine stays on full-time, eliminating the electric-to-gas transition that gives many hybrids their characteristic stair-stepped starts. Instead, the Regal eAssist replaces the stair-step routine with shudders and clunks. On your test drive, note how the drivetrain behaves at low speeds, then click the email link at the end of this review to send me your assessment.\n\nThe eAssist system allows the engine to shut off during certain coasting or braking situations, and, like all hybrids and some conventional cars, it employs regenerative braking and automatic shutoffs at idle. Regenerative brakes that feel natural are a rare find, but the Regal eAssist does well for what it is. The pedal’s a bit mushy at first, but it gets linear farther down.\n\nThe eAssist’s taut ride quality shows the nameplate’s Opel roots — Opel is a GM division in Europe, Buick is a GM division in the U.S. — but its mushy handling falls short. The steering is sharp, but other aspects disappoint. Put the Regal eAssist hard into a corner, and it pitches off-balance as the nose pushes free. Hit a midcorner bump, and the wheels dance outward. A driver’s car, this is not.\n\nPut it all together, and the Regal eAssist delivers an EPA-rated 25/36 mpg city/highway. That’s far better than other trims, which range from 18/29 mpg to 20/32 mpg, so the eAssist’s $2,000 extra cost versus a normally aspirated Regal will recoup itself in reasonable time. All the Regal’s engines run fine on regular gas, but Buick recommends premium to get maximum performance out of the Regal Turbo and GS.\n\nBuick’s devotion to eAssist is clear: The company has announced it will become the standard drivetrain for 2013, eliminating the 2.4-liter four-cylinder. Pricing isn’t yet available.\n\nPerformance Lite\nCourtesy of a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder, the Regal GS packs some heat, but it’s more chipotle than habanero. Endemic of yesteryear’s pint-sized turbo engines, the GS pulls hard only as the tach needle swings past 3,000 rpm. Some of today’s best engines, like the Audi A4 and BMW’s 2012 328i, have plenty of gusto right off the line. Buick claims a hardy 295 pounds-feet of torque at 2,400 rpm, the sort of low-end push that ought to pin you back in your seat. I felt no such excitement, but I do give kudos to the six-speed manual transmission, whose medium throws, precise gates and light clutch are worth spreading to other GM cars. A six-speed automatic will be a no-cost option.\n\nBuick claims the Regal GS makes it to 60 mph in a modest 6.7 seconds. That puts the GS, which has front-wheel drive like other Regals, well short of the all-wheel-drive Regal GS concept car that was shown at the 2010 Detroit auto show. That one was claimed to hit 60 in less than six seconds. As power builds, it comes on in spurts, leaving the tires spinning for traction at higher speeds. Hit the engine’s stride midcorner, and the nose readily pushes wide. Sweeping curves have the Regal GS’ tail sliding out eventually, and the car’s lifelike steering feedback aids the process. The car handles well, but I wish the drivetrain were up to similar snuff.\n\nBuick’s Interactive Drive Control, optional on the Regal Turbo and standard on the GS, adds an adaptive suspension. In the GS, it has regular, Sport and GS settings. The Regal Turbo gets regular, Touring and Sport settings. In the Regal GS, GS mode reduces power-steering assist and stiffens the suspension, but the differences in ride comfort are slim. GS mode improves steering feedback at higher speeds, but no matter the setting the wheel still turns with light effort around town. That’s something I prefer, though driving enthusiasts may want higher-effort steering.\n\nTypical of Buick, road and wind noise are low, but the GS’ sport-tuned suspension gives it a firmer ride than is justified by its modest performance. The suspension isolates well enough on the highway, but potholes and other ruts toss you around, even using Drive Control’s softest settings. Our tester had optional 20-inch wheels and high-performance (summer) P255/35ZR20 tires. The GS’ standard 19-inchers and cushier P245/40R19 tires may improve ride comfort.\n\nThe Inside\nLast year’s review gives a full overview of the interior. Buick’s IntelliLink system, which will roll out in late-issue 2012s, incorporates smartphone applications like Pandora and Stitcher internet radio into a 7-inch dashboard screen. Bluetooth audio connectivity, iPod compatibility and steering-wheel audio controls are also standard.\n\nThe Regal’s center controls take some getting used to. Three knobs — one near the center armrest — control various functions on the dashboard display, which is also a touch-screen. Two of the knobs are redundant, but there are enough nearby functions that you don’t have to reach somewhere else to get something done. Sort through it all, and there’s plenty of functionality. Every navigation system should employ a directional joystick to scroll the map, for example, and Buick’s is in the minority that does.\n\nThe cabin has handsome materials but shoddy fittings. I let panel gaps slide unless they’re really unsightly — and from the glove compartment to the steering wheel hub, our Regal GS had more misfits than a season of “Jersey Shore.” Check out the photos. Buick has work to do.\n\nTrunk volume in most Regals measures 14.2 cubic feet, which is competitive with other entry-luxury sedans. It drops to 11.1 cubic feet in the Regal eAssist, whose lithium-ion battery sits behind the backseat, cutting space and reducing the standard folding backseat to a glorified pass-through. Still, that’s better than some hybrid sedans, whose backseats don’t fold at all.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top scores in front, side and rear crash tests, the Regal is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, plus front and head-protecting side airbags. Side-impact torso airbags for the rear seats are standard on the Regal GS and optional on other trim levels. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the Regal’s first year back, reliability was disappointing. It was below average in a league of reliable competitors: The Audi A4, Acura TSX and Infiniti G25 all have average or above-average reliability records. The Volkswagen CC is the sole competitor in Buick’s below-average camp.\n\nFor around $27,000, the Regal starts with dual-zone automatic climate control, heated leather upholstery and a power driver’s seat. Buick’s IntelliLink system, with its 7-inch touch-screen, will be standard beginning later in 2012. Options include a power passenger seat, a moonroof, Harman Kardon stereo, a navigation system, xenon headlights and upgraded engines — the eAssist, Turbo and GS turbo. Load up the Regal GS, and the price tops $38,000.\n\nRegal in the Market\nThe fastest-growing brand in 2010, Buick is still on a roll. In its first full year of sales, the Regal outsold the TSX, CC and A4. The GS and eAssist expand the car’s potential, but their execution falls short of a slam dunk. Both cars have strong foundations, and their issues could be remedied with an extensive refresh rather than a full redesign. I hope GM can right the ship and improve reliability, because the Regal has a lot going for it otherwise.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Buick Regal has a just-right blend of a comfortable ride and lively acceleration that make up for its shortcomings in around-town maneuverability.\n\nIt’s easy to be confused about Buick’s sedan lineup; a strong family resemblance helps them blend into one another. The Regal is the middle child, competing for attention in a lineup anchored by the well-appointed LaCrosse at the large end and the perky Verano on the compact side. Can the smallish midsize Regal stand out with a clear identity of its own?\n\nFor 2014, the Regal got a light exterior and interior refresh, revised powertrains and available all-wheel drive. See the differences between the 2013 and 2014 models here. The Regal competes against other vehicles that straddle the compact and midsize sedan classes, including the Acura TSX, Audi A4 and Volvo S60. See them compared here.\n\nExterior\nAlthough the Regal’s exterior style melds into its larger and smaller siblings, they’re all handsome. The Regal wears Buick’s large, classy waterfall grille flanked by upswept LED running lamps.\n\nFor 2014, the Regal is only lightly refreshed, with revised headlights, grille, bumper and air intakes in front. Changes to the rear include a tweaked LED taillamp design, trunk lid and bumper. The sport-oriented GS model distinguishes itself with a more aggressive front and rear bumper and larger standard wheels (19 inches, versus 18 inches on the base Regal).\n\nHow It Drives\nQuiet cabins are a Buick strong suit and the Regal is no exception, with excellent isolation from wind and road noise. The engine note, however, breaks the mold a bit. The turbocharged four-cylinder emits an unrefined, gravelly sound at idle. It’s both unbecoming and unexpected in a near-luxury sedan. It’s pretty quick from a stop, though, with only a bit of turbo lag. Still, I expected more immediate oomph from the turbocharged 259-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, especially because it’s 18 percent more powerful than last year’s turbo. I got it in the form of mid-range power, however, where it pours on the steam for easy passing and merging thanks to smooth and timely shifts from the six-speed automatic; a six-speed manual is available in the GS model.\n\nI did not get to drive the optional engine: GM’s eAssist mild hybrid, which carries over from last year and pairs a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor that’s powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. Its fuel economy gains are modest, at 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined, but it props up the regular Regal’s unimpressive numbers, which come in at 21/30/24 mpg with two-wheel drive. It falls behind the pack when compared with two-wheel-drive four-cylinder versions of competitors like the A4 (24/32/27 mpg) and TSX (22/31/26 mpg), but is matched by the S60 (21/30/24 mpg). Buick recommends premium fuel.\n\nOn the highway is where the Regal feels most at home; the combination of natural-feeling, communicative steering with a compliant, composed ride makes it a comfortable cruiser. Bumps are well damped, but cornering exposes some handling weaknesses. Body lean is noticeable, and the car doesn’t stay very well buttoned-down in corners, especially sweeping highway off-ramps. Around-town maneuverability is another weakness. A fairly large turning circle made navigating city parking lots a chore. The Regal’s turning circle is 38 feet, compared with the TSX’s 36.6 and the S60’s 37 feet.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive is new this year, and it got a workout during our test period. The sedan doesn’t look like it will be robust in the snow, but it didn’t let me down after getting plowed into a parking spot on the street. I was able to climb over a pretty significant ridge of packed snow and ice to make my way out; many drivers on the same street were stuck. Fuel economy takes a hit, however; the all-wheel-drive Regal loses 2 mpg in combined fuel economy versus the two-wheel drive model.\n\nInterior\nBuick calls the interior color palette I tested Cashmere, and though the cabin falls short of delivering the elegance that word conveys, it’s still lovely. The design is classy and the materials have a quality look and feel; panels are well-fitted, and touch points are padded. The Regal’s standard imitation wood trim isn’t very convincing, but it’s still appealing. The standard leather seats are wide and plush.\n\nAt roughly 190 inches long, the Regal is at the large end of the compact class and the short end of the midsize-sedan segment. Headroom and legroom up front are competitive, and I carried three small passengers in the backseat on a couple of short trips without complaint. Rear headroom measures 36.8 inches, which is slightly less than the A4 (37.5), TSX (37.0) and S60 (37.4). All of those sedans are several inches shorter in overall length. The Regal makes up for it with extra rear legroom, however, offering 37.3 inches of space back there — several more inches than the listed competitors.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBuick swapped last year’s crowded and cluttered control panel for a more streamlined design this year. The controls are well-organized and easy to understand and use — though some are easier than others. Just about every type of control you can think of is represented here: traditional knobs and buttons, as well as a touch-screen and touch-sensitive flat panels. The trusty first group worked well, but I had mixed experiences with the second set.\n\nThe IntelliLink multimedia system’s touch-screen worked well for audio functions, with quick response time and logical menu structure. The navigation system, optional on base models and standard on higher trims, was slower to respond to touch inputs, but its menu structure was clear and it was easy to alter voice presets or cancel a route. The touch-sensitive flat panels that control the standard heated seats were annoyingly glitchy, and often required multiple stabs. On the flip side, using the standard Bluetooth streaming audio system was a breeze. I was able to pair my phone and launch Pandora in less than 30 seconds.\n\nI have to give a shout-out here to some cold weather accessories that helped heat up my brutal winter weekend with the Regal. All-wheel drive got me out of a jam, and the available remote start system, the heated front seats and the optional heated steering wheel kept me warm while clawing through the snow and ice.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe center console is very small, but Buick makes up for that by peppering the cabin with lots of small and useful storage cubbies. The trunk is competitively sized, and its non-intrusive hinges don’t steal any luggage space. With 14.2 cubic feet of space, it bests the A4 (12.4), the TSX (14) and the S60 (12).\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Buick Regal performed well in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, with an overall score of five stars, as well as Insurance Institute for Highway Safety evaluations, where it earned the top score of good in all tests it underwent.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and a host of new and optional safety features are available for 2014. The Driver Confidence I package is reasonably priced at $890 and includes forward collision alert, a blind spot monitoring system, lane change alert, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a following distance indicator. Driver Confidence II ($1,695) adds full-speed adaptive cruise control and collision preparation, which can bring the vehicle to a stop. Both packages are available only on higher trims.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nBase two-wheel-drive versions of the Regal start at $30,615, and all-wheel drive kicks that up to $32,790; all prices include destination charges. On paper it looks pricey, but it checks in lower than its competitors (the A4, S60 and TSX). Because the Regal plays in the near-luxury class, it feels appropriately priced. It’s easy to go overboard, however; my test model topped out at $40,445 with extras like those safety packages and a moonroof. That seems like a lot to pay for this small Buick, but if you’re in the market for a near-luxury vehicle, the Regal deserves a look — there’s more to like than dislike about Buick’s middle sister.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2014 about the 2014 Buick Regal. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Buick Regal has a just-right blend of a comfortable ride and lively acceleration that make up for its shortcomings in around-town maneuverability.\n\nIt’s easy to be confused about Buick’s sedan lineup; a strong family resemblance helps them blend into one another. The Regal is the middle child, competing for attention in a lineup anchored by the well-appointed LaCrosse at the large end and the perky Verano on the compact side. Can the smallish midsize Regal stand out with a clear identity of its own?\n\nFor 2014, the Regal got a light exterior and interior refresh, revised powertrains and available all-wheel drive. See the differences between the 2013 and 2014 models here. The Regal competes against other vehicles that straddle the compact and midsize sedan classes, including the Acura TSX, Audi A4 and Volvo S60. See them compared here.\n\nExterior\nAlthough the Regal’s exterior style melds into its larger and smaller siblings, they’re all handsome. The Regal wears Buick’s large, classy waterfall grille flanked by upswept LED running lamps.\n\nFor 2014, the Regal is only lightly refreshed, with revised headlights, grille, bumper and air intakes in front. Changes to the rear include a tweaked LED taillamp design, trunk lid and bumper. The sport-oriented GS model distinguishes itself with a more aggressive front and rear bumper and larger standard wheels (19 inches, versus 18 inches on the base Regal).\n\nHow It Drives\nQuiet cabins are a Buick strong suit and the Regal is no exception, with excellent isolation from wind and road noise. The engine note, however, breaks the mold a bit. The turbocharged four-cylinder emits an unrefined, gravelly sound at idle. It’s both unbecoming and unexpected in a near-luxury sedan. It’s pretty quick from a stop, though, with only a bit of turbo lag. Still, I expected more immediate oomph from the turbocharged 259-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, especially because it’s 18 percent more powerful than last year’s turbo. I got it in the form of mid-range power, however, where it pours on the steam for easy passing and merging thanks to smooth and timely shifts from the six-speed automatic; a six-speed manual is available in the GS model.\n\nI did not get to drive the optional engine: GM’s eAssist mild hybrid, which carries over from last year and pairs a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor that’s powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. Its fuel economy gains are modest, at 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined, but it props up the regular Regal’s unimpressive numbers, which come in at 21/30/24 mpg with two-wheel drive. It falls behind the pack when compared with two-wheel-drive four-cylinder versions of competitors like the A4 (24/32/27 mpg) and TSX (22/31/26 mpg), but is matched by the S60 (21/30/24 mpg). Buick recommends premium fuel.\n\nOn the highway is where the Regal feels most at home; the combination of natural-feeling, communicative steering with a compliant, composed ride makes it a comfortable cruiser. Bumps are well damped, but cornering exposes some handling weaknesses. Body lean is noticeable, and the car doesn’t stay very well buttoned-down in corners, especially sweeping highway off-ramps. Around-town maneuverability is another weakness. A fairly large turning circle made navigating city parking lots a chore. The Regal’s turning circle is 38 feet, compared with the TSX’s 36.6 and the S60’s 37 feet.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive is new this year, and it got a workout during our test period. The sedan doesn’t look like it will be robust in the snow, but it didn’t let me down after getting plowed into a parking spot on the street. I was able to climb over a pretty significant ridge of packed snow and ice to make my way out; many drivers on the same street were stuck. Fuel economy takes a hit, however; the all-wheel-drive Regal loses 2 mpg in combined fuel economy versus the two-wheel drive model.\n\nInterior\nBuick calls the interior color palette I tested Cashmere, and though the cabin falls short of delivering the elegance that word conveys, it’s still lovely. The design is classy and the materials have a quality look and feel; panels are well-fitted, and touch points are padded. The Regal’s standard imitation wood trim isn’t very convincing, but it’s still appealing. The standard leather seats are wide and plush.\n\nAt roughly 190 inches long, the Regal is at the large end of the compact class and the short end of the midsize-sedan segment. Headroom and legroom up front are competitive, and I carried three small passengers in the backseat on a couple of short trips without complaint. Rear headroom measures 36.8 inches, which is slightly less than the A4 (37.5), TSX (37.0) and S60 (37.4). All of those sedans are several inches shorter in overall length. The Regal makes up for it with extra rear legroom, however, offering 37.3 inches of space back there — several more inches than the listed competitors.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBuick swapped last year’s crowded and cluttered control panel for a more streamlined design this year. The controls are well-organized and easy to understand and use — though some are easier than others. Just about every type of control you can think of is represented here: traditional knobs and buttons, as well as a touch-screen and touch-sensitive flat panels. The trusty first group worked well, but I had mixed experiences with the second set.\n\nThe IntelliLink multimedia system’s touch-screen worked well for audio functions, with quick response time and logical menu structure. The navigation system, optional on base models and standard on higher trims, was slower to respond to touch inputs, but its menu structure was clear and it was easy to alter voice presets or cancel a route. The touch-sensitive flat panels that control the standard heated seats were annoyingly glitchy, and often required multiple stabs. On the flip side, using the standard Bluetooth streaming audio system was a breeze. I was able to pair my phone and launch Pandora in less than 30 seconds.\n\nI have to give a shout-out here to some cold weather accessories that helped heat up my brutal winter weekend with the Regal. All-wheel drive got me out of a jam, and the available remote start system, the heated front seats and the optional heated steering wheel kept me warm while clawing through the snow and ice.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe center console is very small, but Buick makes up for that by peppering the cabin with lots of small and useful storage cubbies. The trunk is competitively sized, and its non-intrusive hinges don’t steal any luggage space. With 14.2 cubic feet of space, it bests the A4 (12.4), the TSX (14) and the S60 (12).\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Buick Regal performed well in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, with an overall score of five stars, as well as Insurance Institute for Highway Safety evaluations, where it earned the top score of good in all tests it underwent.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and a host of new and optional safety features are available for 2014. The Driver Confidence I package is reasonably priced at $890 and includes forward collision alert, a blind spot monitoring system, lane change alert, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a following distance indicator. Driver Confidence II ($1,695) adds full-speed adaptive cruise control and collision preparation, which can bring the vehicle to a stop. Both packages are available only on higher trims.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nBase two-wheel-drive versions of the Regal start at $30,615, and all-wheel drive kicks that up to $32,790; all prices include destination charges. On paper it looks pricey, but it checks in lower than its competitors (the A4, S60 and TSX). Because the Regal plays in the near-luxury class, it feels appropriately priced. It’s easy to go overboard, however; my test model topped out at $40,445 with extras like those safety packages and a moonroof. That seems like a lot to pay for this small Buick, but if you’re in the market for a near-luxury vehicle, the Regal deserves a look — there’s more to like than dislike about Buick’s middle sister.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Buick’s high-performance 2016 Regal GS doesn’t do enough to boost its performance credibility over the regular turbocharged Regal with all-wheel drive.\n \nVersus the competition: Despite having the latest multimedia and safety technology, an aging and small interior and an underwhelming engine hold the Regal back from keeping up with more authentic luxury cars.\n\nBuick has done a superb job keeping the midsize Regal fresh throughout the car’s lifespan, which started in 2011 and included a refresh for 2014. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and other notable safety technology joined the features lineup in 2014, while a stout multimedia system offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for 2016. Compare the 2016 to the 2015 Regal here.\n\nThe Regal is nearing the end of its life cycle, however, and rumors suggest a new one will be announced as early as calendar year 2017. Similarly sized competitors include the Acura TLX, Infiniti Q50 and Lexus IS, though realistically it is more a direct competitor on price and feature offerings with the TLX than the others. Compare the Regal with those cars here.\n\nOur engine of choice for the Regal is a 259-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, which pairs with front- or all-wheel drive in Regal Turbo and Regal GS models. A 182-hp, naturally aspirated 2.4-liter four-cylinder is standard and comes only on the entry-level 1SV trim. The trim makeup includes 1SV, Sport Touring (available April 2016), Regal, Premium II and GS. A Regal “eAssist” mild hybrid is available to fleet customers only.\n\nI drove the performance-oriented GS, which for 2016 comes with a six-speed automatic transmission only and includes Brembo brakes, lowered suspension with active adjustable-firmness shock absorbers. Compare a Regal GS with the Turbo Premium II here.\nExterior & StylingThe GS performance trim’s styling adds larger, more aggressive lower grille openings to the front and more cleanly integrated dual exhaust tips at the rear. GS models sit lower than the other Regals and wear 19-inch wheels with all-season tires. The attractive, optional 20-inch wheels on our test car are immediately distinguishable from a non-GS Regal and one of the defining characteristics of the car’s exterior. Those 20-inch wheels normally are wrapped in summer tires sized P255/35WR20, but ours rolled on Pirelli winter tires during January testing. \nHow It DrivesThe Regal GS lost a lot of its special flavor in 2014 when Buick decided to use a nearly identical engine in non-GS trim levels. Where there once was a ratings gap, the other turbo engine makes the same 259 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, though Buick says the GS version’s torque peak comes 500 rpm lower than the non-GS turbo. The earlier torque production is hardly enough of a distinguishing factor to make the GS stand out as a performance car compared with the non-GS turbocharged Regal.\n\nThe GS engine’s responsiveness is mushy and lackluster for a power plant that is claimed to reach max torque at 2,500 rpm. This thing doesn’t come alive until a little over 3,000 rpm. Both the potent V-6 available in the TLX and the turbocharged four-cylinder in the IS 200t are significantly more refined engines with less noise and smoother power delivery.\n\nGS models have Sport and GS driving modes activated by buttons oddly located above the center touch-screen; performance mode buttons typically are closer to the gear selector. GS mode is the more aggressive of the two, though the engine remains poky and slow to respond, lacking any characteristics suggesting there’s a performance engine under the hood.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission doesn’t do the GS any favors. There are no steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters such as you’d expect from a performance package, and when you activate the manual mode using the gear selector, there’s only a small indicator showing which gear is picked. The transmission’s programming is suited well enough to performance driving, but the gear ratios don’t make up for the engine’s sluggishness. Buick dropped the manual transmission option previously available for the GS with front-wheel drive.  \n\nGS-specific tuning of the suspension and all-wheel-drive system are the Regal GS’ more noticeable performance pieces. An active suspension adjusts shock damping to suit road conditions and varies overall firmness in the Normal, Sport and GS modes. With the GS button pressed, the shocks firm up and reduce body motion, helping the GS maximize traction and responsiveness during cornering. There’s a considerable leap in firmness from Sport to GS mode, resulting in a little too much bounciness on the streets of Chicago, which honestly doesn’t take much. The suspension is much more compliant in normal and Sport settings where it drives like an ordinary family sedan. \n\nThe Regal GS all-wheel drive is a highlight of the driving experience. GS mode adjusts how the all-wheel drive reacts and right off the bat transfers 15 percent more torque to the rear wheels. An electronic limited-slip rear differential helps transfer torque between the left and right wheels through braking, and you can feel these systems tugging at the car to cleanly navigate through a corner without losing composure, The GS’ rear end will occasionally step out like a rear-wheel-drive car if driven hard enough. The Regal GS’ all-wheel drive has handling prowess similar to that of Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive in the TLX.\nInteriorUnlike the exterior, the Regal’s interior isn’t aging well. It shows in the inconsistent materials and textures in highly visible areas such as the upper dashboard and door panels. Even subcompact luxury cars priced comparably, such as the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA, offer more luxurious trimmings. And top-of-the-line trims of the mainstream Honda Accord and Mazda6 rival the Regal’s interior quality.\n\nSeating comfort is quite good up front with the standard heated leather seats. Backseat room is tight, and the seat’s stadiumlike height towers over the front occupants. It’s a strange seating position for 6-footers like me, and my head touched the ceiling while sitting in the backseat. Plus, the floor hump for the all-wheel drive takes up a large portion of foot space, crowding your feet even when sitting in one of the outboard seats.\n\nAn 8-inch configurable instrument panel between a few analog gauges is exclusive to the GS trim level, though it’s far from a full digital dashboard. The screen is configurable into Touring and Sport displays. Touring mode displays a digital speedometer along with digital trip, navigation or media functions. In Sport mode, the digital speedometer is replaced by an analog-style display, while a digital speedometer can be displayed in the middle. \nErgonomics & ElectronicsBuick has kept the Regal updated with the latest multimedia offerings, including new-for-2016 standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The latter is available as an update for early 2016 Regal owners;  Android Auto didn’t release until spring 2016.\n\nThe Regal’s volume and tuning knobs provide welcome usability in lieu of seek buttons and touch-sensitive panels, plus the home and back buttons always provide a way out. Another usability perk is the way various functions can have shortcuts installed at the top of the screen: navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, radio and weather, for example.\n\nAll of the above are part of Buick’s IntelliLink system with the 8-inch touch-screen that also includes OnStar’s 4G LTE wireless internet with Wi-Fi capability. A three-month or 3-gigabyte free trial is standard, and subscription packages are available after the trial expires. When activated, the Regal has a fairly stout internet connection that is able to stream high-definition video over a phone if the cellular signal is good enough, which it was in Chicago, though some minor interruptions occurred deep in the city near tall buildings. Once gimmicky, this technology is starting to work well. It has the advantage of an externally mounted antenna for picking up a signal where your phone may not.\nSafetyThe Buick Regal earns five out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rates the Regal good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in moderate overlap front, side, roof strength and head restraints and seat crashworthiness ratings. The small overlap front test had not been performed on the Regal at the time of publishing, which is unfortunate because it’s the only crashworthiness test that distinguishes one model from another in the institute’s large family cars class.\n\nThe Regal has a modern selection of optional safety features. Forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and rear cross-traffic alert are lumped into a package called Driver Confidence Package #1. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking where the Regal applies its brakes to prevent or mitigate a forward collision is not part of the first package and requires a pricier Driver Confidence Package #2 for the full suite, which also includes adaptive cruise control. The forward collision system with auto-braking earned the highest rating of superior in IIHS tests. Its sensitivity even is adjustable through a steering-wheel button, easing the tolerance at which the car flashes and sounds an audible alert if the Regal is closing too quickly on a car ahead. The other driving aids are not adjustable in sensitivity, but they can be turned off. See here for a complete list of safety features, and here to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Regal.\nCargo & Storage The Regal trunk’s 14.2 cubic feet of space compares well with its competitors; the Q50 has 13.5 cubic feet, the IS 200t has 13.8 cubic feet and the TLX has 14.3 cubic feet. Storage space up front is a little lacking with just a few small storage cubbies and slots for a key fob, plus a storage bin under the center armrest that’s smaller than its lid suggests. Perhaps oddest is that the bin itself doesn’t contain the USB ports; they are positioned in the small pocket next to the cupholders. All cables still are out of sight when the armrest is closed, however.\nValue in Its ClassNailing the Regal GS’ competitive set isn’t straightforward. As tested in GS trim, our Regal was pricier than top-of-the-line midsize sedans at $40,650 with destination, but it was less expensive than a similarly equipped Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS or Acura TLX, and for good reason: The Regal doesn’t have the luxury feel of the others and is closer to the quality you’ll find in the top trim level of a midsize family sedan than in a luxury-brand vehicle. Most midsize sedans don’t offer a sport package like the Buick Regal GS, but the Regal GS isn’t much of a sport package anyway.\n\nWithin the luxury segment, the Acura TLX is the Regal’s closest competitor in price and feature offerings. A similarly optioned TLX pushes $45,000 with all of the features the Regal offers for $40,000, such as remote start, forward collision warning, all-wheel drive and an upgraded engine. What’s bad for the Regal is that the TLX’s extra $5,000 feels worth it.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "For 2011, the Regal name has returned to Buick’s lineup in the form of a midsize sedan. The 2011 Regal is a good-looking car that seats five, but I found it wasn’t a good fit for my family of four.\n\nThe Regal felt cramped in the front row, but the backseat offered my boys a little more breathing room. However, they struggled with recessed seat belt buckles that made it impossible for them to buckle up independently.\n\nThe performance category is where the Regal really shined. This little Buick is fast! Without any clues that it would be so spry — no rumbling engine noises or vibrating gearshift — the Regal blasted down the freeway, ramping up to 80 mph before I was even aware it had done so. My test car, the Regal CXL Turbo, had an impressive turbocharged engine, and the Regal’s handling was just as impressive. The CXL Turbo has an optional adaptive suspension that automatically adapts to road conditions and driving style. This system has three modes — Normal, Tour and Sport — and it modifies the suspension, gas pedal, automatic transmission and steering.\n\nThe Regal is a performance car in a Buick body. Once again, it proves that the new generation of Buick is nothing like what your grandpa has been driving.\n\nThe non-turbo Regal base model starts at $26,245, while my test car cost $31,975.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe Regal is not a show-stopper. None of my neighbors, friends or family fawned over the Regal the same way they would a loaded minivan or trouble-inducing coupe.\n\nThe lack of attention made me feel lukewarm about the car. I wanted to tell people how fun Regal is to drive and how surprisingly spacious the trunk is. I wanted to point out the sporty details intended to set the Regal apart from other Buicks. I especially liked the horizontal lines inset near the fog lights, which were even further defined by a chrome perimeter. In the back, the Regal was highly sculpted with scrolling lines created by a shapely trunklid. More chrome touches and the slight slope of an integrated spoiler also made the Regal’s eat-my-dust view more interesting.\n\nLuxury touches like power heated side mirrors, the keyfob’s push-button trunk release and ultrasonic rear parking assist were conveniences that I’d expect to see in a Buick, so they didn’t do much to impress me.\n\nMy two school-age boys had no problems getting in and out of the Regal, which was great because we all had problems once we got settled inside the sedan.\n\nThe Regal’s 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual is optional. The Regal gets an EPA-estimated 18/28 mpg city/highway and uses regular gasoline. Its 18-gallon gas tank made sure that fuel fill-ups wouldn’t cramp my already loaded schedule. The CXL Turbo can also run on E85 ethanol, but it lowers the car’s fuel economy numbers to 13/21 mpg.\n\nThe base Regal has a 182-hp, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder that gets 19/30 mpg and uses regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe Regal’s interior was too close for comfort. Although it had plenty of luxurious touches, I felt claustrophobic in it. Perhaps the wrap-around dash was hugging me a bit too closely.\n\nThe Regal has standard heated leather seats and a dual-zone climate control system with air filtration. I didn’t notice the air filtration system when I was test-driving the Regal, but I did the next week when I test-drove a car that didn’t have a similar system. Without a filtration system, I couldn’t stop sneezing.\n\nThe Regal’s power-adjustable driver’s seat and tilt/telescoping steering wheel helped me customize my driver’s side fit while the XM Satellite Radio kept my hubby entertained. The optional navigation system kept the kids focused on where we were on the map. I was surprised that the nav system didn’t include a backup camera, especially since the LCD screen atop the dash was capable of displaying various bits of vehicle data as well as DVD movies. It certainly could have displayed the rear view just as well. This five-seat sedan also has a power sunroof, but its average size didn’t thrill me.\n\nIt felt like my boys had more space in the backseat than I had in the front row. The Regal has two cupholders and some storage in the fold-down armrest that they put to good use.\n\nWhen I opened up the trunk, I realized where the front row’s space went. There was plenty of room in the never-ending cargo area that looked like it was built for golf bags. This trunk could swallow a lot of kids’ gear without any complaints.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2011 Regal has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests as well as have a standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe Regal also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, front-wheel drive and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows.\n\nBuick offers side-impact airbags for the second row that are optional. The Regal comes with a six-month free trial of OnStar, a communication system. It then becomes a subscription-based service.\n\nThis sedan has five lower Latch anchors with two sets in the outboard seats and one anchor in the middle position. These anchors were buried beneath the seat cushions and really frustrating to use. They were so frustrating that they kept me from using the Latch system with my boys’ booster seats. My boys had problems buckling up independently because of the Regal’s recessed seat belt buckles in the backseat. Recessed seat belt receptors meant I had to revert back to toddler-dom with my older children and help them both buckle in every single time we got in the car.\n\nIn MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check of the 2011 Regal, the testers found that a forward- and rear-facing convertible as well as a rear-facing infant-safety seat fit well in the sedan.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Buick Regal here.",
