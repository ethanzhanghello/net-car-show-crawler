The 3.1-liter, 155-h.p., V-6 is responsive and fairly quiet and deliversvery good fuel economy at 19 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway. Driver-side air bag and ABS standard. Dual air bags and traction controlare coming for 1996 and though that will raise the price, the safety benefitsare worth the investment. Hold off for the ’96. One question: Does Buick needa compact coupe? Base price: $17,230.",

      "expert_review": "After driving the redesigned Buick Skylark, you are tempted to think General Motors hasn’t learned much since it started building cars in 1908.\n\nOf course, we know that’s not true.\n\nAfter a devastating $4.5 billion loss in 1991, GM returned to profitability in the first quarter of 1992. The world’s largest automaker is rebounding quickly because of cost-cutting measures and because of an improved line of cars, trucks and vans that are rapidly closing the gap – and in some cases passing – the competition.\n\nHowever, there are still a few chinks in GM’s armor. The Buick Skylark GS is one of them.\n\nIt seems mind-boggling that GM could miss the mark so widely with this overpriced, under-equipped compact car – especially since the standards for this size vehicle are so clearly defined in cars such as the Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord.\n\nBuick has a strong lineup with the the Park Avenue, Roadmaster and LeSabre, but the new Skylark needs a major rethink. Sales have dropped: 21,142 Skylarks were sold in the first quarter of 1992; 35,807 were sold in the first quarter of 1991.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOn the Skylark, the GS stands for Gran Sport, so that’s why you’ll find some extra muscle under the hood. Standard models come with a 2.2-liter four cylinder, but under the GS model’s wildly curved hood rests a potent, but civilized 160-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 and an automatic transmission.\n\nThe Skylark GS is no muscle car, but it has snappy acceleration and can ease past slower moving traffic with only slight pressure on the accelerator.\n\nPerformance figures are not available for the Skylark, but I would guess 0 to 60 mph comes up in about 10 seconds.\n\nNo company makes better automatic transmissions than GM. The one in the Skylark upholds this notion, but there’s a problem here. It’s only a three-speed automatic. Virtually all other manufacturers have gone to computer-controlled four-speed automatics.\n\nThe lack of afour-speed automatic is one of the Skylark’s major shortcomings. A four-speed automatic usually increases performance and fuel mileage while saving wear and tear on the engine.\n\nStill, the fuel economy is good; the test car averaged 18 miles per gallon in the city and 28 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThere are three buttons on the dash that adjust the electronically controlled shock absorbers.\n\nIn the ”sport” mode, the car is transformed into an agile and capable driving machine that excelled in all areas except quick, panicked turns. That’s when the front wheels lost traction. The two other selections are ”normal” and ”touring.”\n\nThe ride is typical Buick. It’s nimble, comfortable, relaxed and hovering on the edge of sportiness, yet you can never push the car too hard without causing it to lose its composure. The car understeers (the rear tires have more traction than the front tires) when cornering fast.\n\nThe turning diameter is a m anageable 35 feet. The test car came with a fine set of anti-lock front disc and rear drum brakes.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nHere’s where nearly all the mistakes were made. Let’s start with the seats.\n\nThe manually adjustable lumbar support for the front buckets – controlled by a knob on the side of the seats – shoves what feels like a square piece of metal into the small of your back.\n\nThe only way to achieve reasonable comfort is to fully retract the lumbar adjustment. Many other cars use an inflatable bag inside the seat to adjust the lumbar support.\n\nThe rear seats are not bad, but getting into them can be hazardous because the design of the rear do ors makes it difficult to enter or exit without smashing your head.\n\nOn a car costing nearly $20,000, a driver’s side air bag should be standard equipment as it is on most similarly priced cars. You can’t get an air bag in the Skylark.\n\nThe car’s styling drew several negative comments. A passenger said t e Skylark looked like a MardiGras float, and he wondered if there were a button on the dash that changed the appearance to normal.\n\nThere are some funky curves on this car, both inside and out.\n\nThe rounded, swooping dash houses a full complement of analog gauges that would be fine, if they weren’t partially obscured by the steering wheel.\n\nOn the driver’s side, the master window switches are located on the dash. They are difficult to find and use at night. The front passenger’s window switch is on the lower portion of the door panel. It looks as if it were tacked on at the last minute.\n\nTo the car’s credit, there is an easy-to-load trunk with ample space and an elastic net to hold grocery bags and other parcels in place.\n\nVisibility is fine front and rear.\n\nExcept for a few loose pieces of plastic trim on the dash and on the seats, the car seems to be assembled reasonably well.\n\nThere may be other versions of the Skylark worth considering, but the GS model at about $20,000 does not compare well to competitive cars.\n\nTruett’s tip: The sport version of Buick’s compact sedan needs a driver’s side air bag, a four-speed automatic transmission and rear doors that allow easier access. The car falls short of established standards for sporty compact sedans.",

      "expert_review": "There’s a tendency among some consumers and a growing contingent of the automotive media to focus on new sheet metal at the expense of 2-, 3- or 4-year-old body styles with technological improvements.\n\nBased on that, the 1994 Buick Skylark would be overlooked since the body panels are the same as they were for 1993.\n\nBut that wouldn’t do justice to the fact that the compact needed only a fewlittle changes to become more desirable-a 4-speed automatic transmission, a quieter and more fuel efficient V-6 engine, an air bag and an engineer to redothe power locking system so you could open the door without having to push thebutton once you put the car in park.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, Buick addressed each of those aggravations. For the new model year, consumers get a 4-speed automatic and not just the 3-speedthat General Motors foisted on Buick in the Skylark, Pontiac in the Grand Am and Oldsmobile in the Achieva to get rid of a bunch of the transmissions.\n\nAnd they get a driver-side air bag. GM, you may recall, insisted that consumers don’t use air bags as often as they do anti-lock brakes so they offered ABS in most of their cars and procrastinated on air bags. Of course the reason ABS was promoted and air bags were pooh poohed is that GM makes itsown ABS but has to get bags from outside suppliers. It’s called keeping the profit in the family. Anyway, after enough consumer yelping, GM now offers a driver- side bag in the 1994 Skylark (Grand Am and Achieva, too). A passenger-side bag isn’t available, but the driver-side cushion is a good start.\n\nAnother change finds the 3.3-liter, 160-horsepower, V-6 engine discontinuedin favor of a 3.1-liter, 155-h.p., V-6 that has made the rounds at various GM divisions for years. Why give up on the 3.3 and why give up 5 h.p. to boot?\n\nBy switching to sequential-port injection on the 3.1 V-6, Buick was able toboost horsepower to 155 from 140 While 5 h.p. shy of the 3.3’s 160, the mileage rating on the 3.1 went up by 2 miles per gallon in city driving and 3 m.p.g. on the highway. A 22 m.p.g. city/32 m.p.g. highway rating was considered worth a 5 h.p. sacrifice.\n\nWe test drove the 1994 Skylark Gran Sport coupe with the 3.1 V-6 and 4-speed automatic and found one more benefit from dropping the 3.3. The revised 3.1 offers quieter operation and less noise at acceleration from the line. And even with a 5 h.p. difference, the 3.1 delivers more than adequate power to move from the light, pass or merge-more quietly.\n\nAnd having one more forward gear makes a difference. Perhaps it’s only psychological, but that one extra gear seems to get the most out of the 3.1’s horses.\n\nThat 3.1, 4-speed combo is standard on the Gran Sport sedan and Skylark Limited sedan, too.\n\nThe Skylark Custom coupe and sedan offer a 2.3-liter, 115-h.p. 16 valve Quad Four with 3-speed automatic as standard, with the 3.1 and 4-speed as an option. The 2.3 is rated at 23 m. p.g. city/31 m.p.g. highway with 3-speed, 22/32 with 4-speed-the same as with the livelier and quieter 3.1 and 4-speed.\n\nOur test car also came with the standard touring suspension that hugs the road and allows the car to sit flat for better driver control in sharp cornersor turns.\n\nContributing to the gripping capability and helping ensure tight corners atspeed are the Goodyear p205/55R16 Eagle GA radial tires standard on the Gran Sport. The Custom sedan and coupe and Limited sedan have to rely on 14-inch Michelin all-season radials as standard, 15-inch all seasons as optional. The Limited sedan also offers the 16-inch tires as an option. Those who choose a Custom should get the 15-inch tires, those who go for a Limited the 16-inch treads.\n\nWith the touring suspension and 16-inch tires the Gran Sport has very good lateral movement and control. The price you pay is a little stiffness and harshness over the big bumps in the road.\n\nComplementing the lively .1 V-6 and the nimble ride and sure-footed handling is the security you get from knowing an air bag is in the wheelhub and anti-lock is at all four wheels. We stood on the binders on wet pavement and the Gran Sport stopped straight without wavering.\n\nAs for that other change noted above, the one in which owners wanted the power door lock system to let them go once they arrived at their destination, Buick engineers gave in for 1994. It used to be that the doors would lock whenyou started the car and shifted into drive but wouldn’t automatically unlock when you stopped the car and shifted into park. Until you pressed the unlock button, you were held hostage in your own car. They called the system “power” locking, but you were powerless to step into your own driveway until reaching for the button.\n\nWhile the system prohibited swift exit from the car, some motorists demanded it, insisting there are parts of this country where you don’t want the doors to automatically unlock when you pull into a parking space-such as just about anywhere in New York or Detroit between downtown and any of the Pointes or Bloomfield Hills.\n\nFor 1994, a dealer can remove a fuse so that when you stop and put the lever in park the door will automatically unlock so you can make a speedy departure. Thank you, GM.\n\nA couple of other nice touches to the Gran Sport are the cupholder/coinholder that pull out from the lower console and the tissue holder in that console. One change we’d like to make, however, is streamliningthe power window/door lock controls in the upper front of the door where they tend to get in the way of the driver’s knee.\n\nOther changes for 1994 include adding a Polo Green exterior color, shortening the window wiper stalk that was as long if not longer than the gearshift lever, lighting the power window switches for better nighttime visibility, dropping adjustable ride control but adding a new electric power sliding sunroof with shade (midyear) and replacing the power antenna with a rear glass grid antenna (midyear).\n\nAnd when it comes to paying attention to the teenie weenie details, kudos to Buick for placing a pair of blue dots at the opening where the CD disk is inserted into the optional dash mounted player to make it easier for users to see at night.\n\nOther standard equipment in the front-wheel-drive Gran Sport coupe includespower brakes and steering, stainless steel exhaust, non-Freon air conditioning, cruise control, side window defoggers (rear defogger an option),tilt steering, leather-wrapped steering wheel, trunk net, remote trunk release, tinted glass, dual mirrors (power left side), bodyside moldings, power windows and AM-FM stereo with clock.\n\nBase price for the Gran Sport coupe is $18,299, the Gran Sport sedan $18,299. Add $485 for freight.\n\nTo capitalize on the rising value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and the subsequent hefty price increases on those foreign cars, Buick is offering several “market value” editions for 1994. These are models with options made standard at a discounted price.\n\nIn the Skylark line the Custom coupe and sedan will start at $13,995 yet include such options as air conditioning, rear window defogger, cruise controland tilt wheel. That represents a savings of $960 from the price of the car with those items added as options.",

      "expert_review": "The Buick automobile, which bears one of the most storied names on the American automotive scene, continues to adhere to its roots, which were established in 1903 and 1904.\n\nThe first two-cylinder Buick, whose prototype began in 1903, was sold in August 1904.\n\nIt was followed by a four-cylinder car in 1906, and 87 model years later Buick still is offering a four-cylinder automobile.\n\nThis time it is in the form of the 1993 Buick Skylark, a car that was totally redesigned for 1992 and returns in ’93 form with new trim levels and features designed to increase customer satisfaction. As the best-equipped compact the Buick Motor Division ever has offered, the coupe and sedan models carry forward a distinctive styling statement in three versions.\n\nOffered are the Custom, Limited and Gran Sport levels, with all three series available in both two-door and four-door form. The coupes and the sedans have identical specifications and basic styling themes other than that associated with the absence of rear doors on the coupe.\n\nThe Skylark lies right in the middle of compact-car specifications. It’s big enough to provide respectable room, and it can function as a six-passenger when a standard 55/45 split-bench front seat is used with the Custom and Limited series.\n\nOptional in these two models are front bucket seats. Buckets are standard in the Gran Sport.\n\nGran Sport tested\n\nThe ’93 Gran Sport that Gregg Hutchinson, vice president and general manager of Ogle-Tucker Buick, provided for a test car was the sportiest version of the models.\n\nThe car had a standard Gran Touring suspension system, plus an optional adjustable ride control system that gave the ride the best of all worlds. There was a Soft setting for a boulevard-type ride, a Sport setting for tighter control in high-speed corners, and an Automatic setting that automatically adjusts to vehicle speed and the “g” forces acting on the chassis.\n\nAutomatic ride changes the shock absorber’s damping rates, with the system using firm shock valving below 5 miles per hour for a more controlled launch and braking. From 5 to 50 mph, the Soft valving is activated. Above 50 mph, the Sport setting is activated for better control.\n\nEven in the sport mode, however, the system didn’t bind up the suspension movement to where the ride was harsh. The Skylark still rode like a Buick, with the Sport setting virtually negating body roll in hard, fast corners.\n\nControl was further assisted by 16-inch aluminum wheels carrying Eagle GA Touring rubber, and sensitive, pinpoint-accurate steering. The tires put down a big footprint on the pavement for maximum traction, and there was instant reaction to steering wheel movement.\n\nOne of the better features associated with the Gran Sport is its standard V-6 engine, a motor that is an option with the Custom and Limited models.\n\nThe engine is Buick’s own 3300 Series V-6 that is the base for the turbocharged IndyCar Buick V-6; at 204 cubic inches it provided horsepowe r and torque for spirited performance.\n\nI’d say it is quite preferable to the 115-horsepower, single-overhead-cam Quad four-cylinder engine that is standard in Custom and Limited models.\n\nAn automatic transmission is standard on all Skylarks, and when you jump on the power with the V-6, activity begins in a hurry. It doesn’t make a drag racer out of the car. But the Gran Sport is moderately light — in the 2,800-pound range depending upon equipment — and the 3300 brings it off the line with a steady launch.\n\nStyling features\n\nFor the sports types who really would rather just look sporting rather than actually get all that involved with the process, the Gran Sport test car had a lot of individual styling features that set it apart from its sister vehicles.\n\nThere were body side moldings with black inserts, tail lamps with black horizontal bars, leather on the shift handle and steeringwheel, and liberal splashes of leather and cloth upholstery that enhanced the inter ior tri m. In all, the appointments were a class act.\n\nSports-oriented motorists will like the full instrumentation and the way all controls are conveniently grouped around the driver. It’s not necessary to start reaching out for switches and the like to activate them.\n\nThe test car was pretty well equipped, a facet that made driving pleasant but not inexpensive from a purchase standpoint. The bottom line on the sticker read in the mid-$19,000s. However, in exchange about all the comfort and convenience items found in Buick’s big automobiles were contained in a $2,643 prestige option package.\n\nAbout the only thing missing that I thought should be on a car in this price range was a four-speed automatic transmission instead of the Skylark’s three-speed automatic.\n\nSuitable as everyday car\n\nThe Gran Sport cognomen may be a little misleading in that one might expect the car to be more suitable for sports use than utility. Not so.\n\nThe model easily qualifies for an everyday go-to-work automobile that can perform yeoman functions as well as put a little spice in your life.\n\nThere is quite decent legroom in the back seat, and obviously rear entrance with the four-door is much more convenient than with the coupe. It did pay to duck a little when climbing behind the wheel. But on balance entrance and exit was easy, and the overall comfort quotient quite high.\n\n1993 Buick Skylark Gran Sport Base Price: $15,760.As tested: $19,471.Type: Front-engine, front-drive, five-passenger sedan.

      "expert_review": "What is it about the Buick Skylark that gets it no respect?\n\nIt’s never in the front of Buick’s catalog, nor first in the hearts of its buyers. It fills the entry-level niche at luxury-oriented Buick, sharing its underpinnings with the Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Achieva. It sells the fewest copies of the three.\n\nBut there’s plenty to change that for ’96.\n\nTo start with, stylists tamed the Skylark’s bodacious beak, giving it a more conservative look (the swoopy side trim is retained). It’s certainly a more acceptable look for Buick’s mature buyers. The back end is much the same, but the result is an improved set of feathers for Buick’s bird.\n\nTrim levels are the same as last year: entry-level Custom, upscale Limited, and sporty Gran Sport, each available as a two-door or four-dour.\n\nThe four-door is the more practical choice, as the sporting character of this car isn’t overwhelming. The standard engine is GM’s new 2.4-liter Twin-Cam Four, which produces 150 horses. The optional 3.1-liter V-6 is the better choice, not so much for its additional five horsepower, but for 185 foot-pounds of torque that come at a lower point. It works better with the standard four-speed automatic transmission. The result is good acceleration, although the engine has a gruff exhaust note when pushed.\n\nIn the handling department, the snubbed-down sports suspension does an agreeable job, but isn’t sophisticated enough to smother big bumps. It tends to transfer them to the passenger compartment while the front end exhibits some float.\n\nBut that’s the only sour note for handling. The standard front disc-rear drum power brakes with anti-lock brought the car to a halt without fanfare. Traction control also is standard this year, as are dual airbags, bringing this car’s safety up to date with its competitors.\n\nInside, the good news continues. Last year’s flaring, nightmarish interior has flown the coop, replaced by a modern dash that it shares with its Oldsmobile cousin. Three rotary knobs manage the climate control system and have a good feel, as do all the switches. The Skylark is still cursed with GM’s tacky windshield wiper/bright lights/cruise control/turn signal stalk that never gets any easier to use.\n\nWhat is easier to use are the seat belts. No longer anchored to the doors, they’re on the pillar, where they belong. In addition, they’re adjustable.\n\nSkylark’s gauges are marked clearly and are easy to read.\n\nThe biggest improvement is in seating. The front buckets in this car, redesigned this year, are some of GM’s most supportive and comfortable. Long drives didn’t bring out any driver fatigue — rare for an inexpensive car, especially from GM. The power window and lock switches are ideally placed. This year, GM also has switched to a single key for doors, ignition and trunk, making life a little easier.\n\nBut there are still nits to pick. The automatic transmission lever is just tall enough to knock while trying to adjust the stereo. The storage bin’s odd shape renders it almost useless, and its mouse-fur lining sheds. There’s no place for coins, unusual for a newly redesigned car. But these are little things in a car the interior of which is so improved.\n\nGM stylists have tamed the weird, wild nature of the Skylark. But, while gentling this bird, they also gave it a more refined look, bringing it into line with a Buick customer’s expectations. While not outstanding in any area, this baby Buick is a competent choice in a compact car.\n\nNow if they would just improve the suspension, it might finally get some respect….\n\n1996 Buick Gran Sport Standard: Dual airbags, anti-lock front disc-rear drum brakes, power rack-and-pinion steering, tilt wheel, four-speed automatic transmission, P195/70R14 tires, air conditioning, floor mats, rear window defroster, power door locks, dual vanity mirrors with lights, AM/FM stereo, re lining front bucket seats, intermittent windshield wipers, 2.4-literfour-cylinder engine.
