      "expert_review": "Buick goes for glitz with Rendezvous Ultra\n\nMy friend Ted called about a year ago for car advice. Ted’s wife, Karen, was getting rid of her GMC Safari van now that their youngest daughter was off to college and wanted a sportier ride.\n\nTed said Karen was looking at a Buick Rendezvous, and I suggested they also check out the Lexus RX 300 and a few other crossover utility vehicles in the same size and price ranges.\n\nAfter shopping and dickering, they bought the Rendezvous. That didn’t surprise me, considering Ted is an accountant, not to mention something of a cheapskate, and they could pick up the Buick for about $10,000 less than the Lexus. What did surprise me was how much Karen liked the Rendezvous.\n\n“She said it’s the best vehicle she’s ever owned,” Ted confided. “It’s really worked out well for us.”\n\nSince it was year-end tax time last week, I figured Ted was the perfect person to check out the ritzy new 2004 Rendezvous Ultra that Buick had just dropped off for a brief holiday test drive.\n\nAs the name implies, the Ultra is sort of the uber-Rendezvous and is just beginning to reach Buick showrooms this month. Our test vehicle started life as a Rendezvous AWD model priced at $29,855, and came equipped with the Ultra package ($9,840) and a DVD entertainment center ($1,100). That pushed the bottom line to $40,795, making this one of the most expensive Buicks I’ve ever driven.\n\nI didn’t break the economic news immediately to Ted. We took a lunch break, and after a five-mile loop in the Ultra, he pronounced it a pretty nice package. Ted was particularly impressed by the leather seats with suede inserts and the wood-and-leather steering wheel, although he seemed unnerved by the head-up display.\n\nHe also liked the rich-looking monochromatic exterior paint scheme (our test vehicle was finished in dark steel blue metallic).\n\nAnd then I told him the price. Ted’s jaw literally dropped.\n\n“No way,” he sputtered in amazement. “Karen and I paid $25,000 for our Rendezvous, and it’s nicely equipped. How did they come up with 40 grand for this package?”\n\nWell, let me count the ways.\n\nThe basic Rendezvous, as Ted noted, is pretty well-furnished, with such standard hardware as side air bags, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, remote keyless entry and an overhead console.\n\nThe Ultra package bundles just about every other gadget in the Buick parts bin, including the fancy seats and steering wheel and the head-up display, plus 17-inch wheels and tires, a six-disc CD changer, second-row captain’s chairs, third-row bench, heated power front seats with memory, dual-zone climate controls, rear parking aid and XM satellite radio, to mention just a few.\n\nBesides the DVD entertainment center, the only other options available are a navigation radio ($1,555) and sunroof ($885).\n\nThe heart of the Rendezvous Ultra is a new twin-cam 3.6-liter V-6 engine that is shared with the Cadillac CTS. In the Ultra, the engine delivers an ample 245 horsepower and 235 pounds-feet of torque, a nice bump from the 185 horsepower and 210 pounds-feet provided by the overhead-valve 3.4-liter V-6 in the standard Rendezvous.\n\nThe 3.6 in the Ultra is mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, and returns 18 miles per gallon in city driving and a respectable 25 mpg on the highway, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe twin-cam engine is noticeably more lively than the pushrod V-6 in the base Rendezvous. It feels even more responsive than the 3.3-liter V-6 in the recently redesigned RX 330, and nearly as quick as the twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter six in the Volvo XC90, due in no small part to the fact that the Buick is 500 to 600 pounds lighter than the Volvo.\n\nWhile they are less than an inch apart in overall length, the Rendezvous has a much longer wheelbase than the RX 330. Co bined with an all-independent suspension, the result is a smooth and controlled ride that should make new converts out of longtime SUV owners coming from truck-based models like the Mercury Mountaineer or the GMC Envoy. It also sets the Rendezvous Ultra clearly apart from its new SUV sibling, the Rainier (which shares its underpinnings with the Envoy).\n\nBuick is promoting the Ultra’s refinement, particularly in the refurbished cabin. Truth be told, that was one of the weak points of the original Rendezvous. The Ultra does look much glitzier and for the most part is fairly tasteful, with one glaring exception.\n\nFor some reason, Buick designers insisted on applying a massive chunk of fake-looking wood on the center stack that recalls some of the high-end Chinese-made Buick Regals that I’ve driven in Shanghai. It doesn’t even look like the same (and much nicer) wood that.s used on the steering wheel.\n\nThe heavy-handed application has the undesired effect of making the Ultra.s cockpit look cheaper, rather than more elegant. Others in the segment, including Lexus and Volvo, do far more with less, and Buick would do well to study them and apply the lessons to the Ultra in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the gauge package is exquisite. The matte-metal look is accented by turquoise-color match-needle pointers and a sophisticated typeface that appears to have been lifted out of a fashion magazine.\n\nThe seats look and feel rich, and provide excellent support, even for larger posteriors such as mine. There are captain.s chairs in the second row, which make for easier access to the stowable third-row bench seat. But I have to say, and Ted agrees with me, that the third row remains of limited use, even for families with small children.\n\nIn fact, we see more older couples and empty-nesters driving the Rendezvous, which suggests that the third row is rarely used. The bench seat comes bundled with the Ultra package, but Buick should probably consider making it a delete option for those buyers who don’t really need or want it and would prefer the extra cargo space.\n\nBack to the issue of price. Listing for just over $37,000, the all-wheel-drive version of the Lexus RX 330 seems like a much better value than the Rendezous Ultra, especially when you throw in the reputation of the Lexus brand.\n\nBeing a much sharper shopper than me, however, Ted would probably point out that the 2004 Ultra will be eligible for any incentives that Buick is offering on the Rendezvous. As I write this on New Year’s Eve, Rendezvous buyers can choose between a $3,000 rebate or zero-interest financing for up to 60 months, and GM is likely to extend some comparable incentives into the new year.\n\nIf you can get past that big chunk of wood on the instrument panel and minor annoyances like the head-up display, the new Rendezvous Ultra merits serious consideration by any consumer looking for a premium cross over vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuick introduced the Rendezvous crossover vehicle — which blends sedan, sport utility vehicle and minivan characteristics — for 2002. For 2006, the Rendezvous’ available trims have been revised slightly and a new engine is available. Both front- and all-wheel-drive models continue to be offered. CXL Plus editions feature a 242-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 with variable valve timing; this engine is optional in the CXL. The new base engine is a 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nA touchscreen navigation system is optional, and 17-inch wheels are standard. Several features become standard for 2006, including rear park assist and General Motors’ OnStar communication system.\n\nExterior\nDescribed by Buick as having a “refined ruggedness,” the Rendezvous has an overall shape like that of an SUV. Sharp lines take precedence over curves, and Buick gave it a rear slope in contrast to the typically boxy SUV shape. It shares styling elements with other Buicks, and gets a new grille for 2006.\n\nChrome wheels are available on models with the 3.6-liter V-6. Each Rendezvous rides a 112.2-inch wheelbase, measures 186.5 inches long overall and stands 68.9 inches tall. A fully independent suspension is installed.\n\nInterior\nIn standard form, the Rendezvous seats five occupants, but its reconfigurable interior can be equipped with third-row seats that hold two additional people. The second row can have either a three-place split bench seat or two captain’s chairs. The second-row seats flip and fold for access to the rear. Cargo volume totals 108.9 cubic feet when the seats are folded, and a 4-by-8-foot panel can be loaded through the back door. Low doorsills ease entry and exit.\n\nThe standard Ultrasonic Rear Park Assist system can warn the driver of obstacles to the rear. XM Satellite Radio and DVD entertainment are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 develops 201 hp in front-wheel-drive Rendezvous models and 196 hp in all-wheel-drive editions. A 242-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is available. Both engines employ a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and antilock brakes are available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAutomatic-transmission responses are quick and easy in the Rendezvous. Acceleration is good, if not exactly inspiring. The Rendezvous runs very quietly and offers plenty of versatile space. The gauges are notable in appearance, but they’re not the easiest to read at a glance.\n\nThe Rendezvous delivers a generally soft ride, but its suspension hits some bumps rather hard. Handling is reasonably precise with good steering feel and feedback, very much like what drivers might expect from a minivan.",

      "expert_review": "Americans don’t want sport-utility vehicles. They want station wagons. They’ve always wanted station wagons, which is why they started buying sport-utility vehicles in the first place.\n\nSUVs are rolling symbols of federal energy policy gone awry.\n\nLawmakers, afraid to take the political weight for conserving gasoline through higher fuel taxes, shifted the burden to automakers. The lawmakers told the car companies to make more fuel-efficient vehicles or suffer financial penalties.\n\nThe car companies complied by downsizing their new-vehicle fleets, which meant the virtual elimination of big station wagons.\n\nThat put big American families in a bind. They turned to trucks — vans, minivans, pickups and SUVs. Trucks had way more room than downsized cars. They also had lower fuel-economy requirements than automobiles. But the lawmakers didn’t seem to mind that; nor did the buying public.\n\nTrucks now make up 50 percent of the new-vehicle market in the United States. To some, that might seem a repudiation of the theory that Americans really prefer station wagons.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nThe proof is in the 2002 Buick Rendezvous CXL, the latest in a series of station wagons designed to look like trucks.\n\nThe Rendezvous possesses all of the station-wagon characteristics Americans love, including a spacious interior for people and cargo and a smooth ride.\n\nIt has none of the truckiness that consumers have come to hate in SUVs — no dicey handling or bumpety-bump road manners.\n\nThough it shares the same body structure with the abysmally styled Pontiac Aztek, the Rendezvous, by comparison, is an appealing work of art. The look is chic suburban, or what General Motors Corp., the vehicle’s maker, calls “refined ruggedness.”\n\nThat means the Rendezvous looks as if it can go off-road, as long as “off-road” means the gravel parking lot of a country club, or the grassy expanse behind the fence of a steeplechase race.\n\nThat same limited “off-road” ability holds true for the Rendezvous equipped with GM’s optional all-wheel-drive Versatrak system. It’ll get you through snow and shallow mud but nothing more challenging. But surely, no one with common sense would deliberately put the Rendezvous in proximity of anything that could scratch its surface or muddy its interior.\n\nStep inside the tested Rendezvous CXL to see why. There are two-tone leather-faced seats, brushed metallic accents in the door and instrument panel, deep-pile carpeting front to rear, and an optional “new generation” head-up display that projects speed and data on other vehicle functions on the bottom of the windshield. Ah, there’s also an optional audio entertainment system with rear-seat controls and headphones.\n\nThis one is going into the deepest, darkest forest? Hardly!\n\nThe Rendezvous can be equipped to haul a trailer weighing 3,500 pounds, as cou ld any large station wagon of yore.\n\nThe auto industry has been going through great pains to call Rendezvous-like vehicles anything but station wagons. Their fear is that station wagons are pass&eacute; and off-putting to young and restless families who are psychologically opposed to “uncool” family transportation, such as minivans.\n\nAuto marketers say those families want something sporty, hip, versatile. They want a vehicle that supports an “active outdoors life,” marketers say.\n\nBaloney.\n\nYoung American families today want what American families have always wanted: a vehicle big enough to carry their people and things. Covered wagons once served that purpose. Station wagons eventually followed. Trucks began arriving in force in the mid-1980s.\n\nNow, station wagons, albeit in new form, are back. It’s about time.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuicks Rendezvous crossover vehicle was brand-new for the 2002 model year. It blends the virtues of a sedan, sport utility vehicle and minivan and serves as the first truck-based model in Buicks lineup since 1923. With the Rendezvous, Buick hoped to attract more younger buyers and counteract the brands appeal to older motorists. To help in that quest, and long before it went on sale, Buick exhibited the Rendezvous at golf tournaments, the COMDEX computer dealers convention and various public events.\n\nTwo new entertainment options will become available in the 2003 model. An XM Satellite Radio and a DVD-based system that has a 7-inch fold-down screen for video viewing in the rear seats may be installed in the new Rendezvous. At midseason, the Mexican-built SUV will gain an electronic liftgate release.\n\nEither five or seven passengers can ride in the Rendezvous. A fully independent suspension aims to ease the ride quality, which is intended to emulate the Park Avenue Ultra sedan. The Rendezvous comes in two forms: as the front-wheel-drive CX model and as the higher-level CXL trim with Versatrak all-wheel drive (AWD). Versatrak is an optional feature on the CX, and this AWD system gives the Rendezvous extra flexibility in various road conditions.\n\nExterior\nDescribed by the manufacturer as having a refined ruggedness, the Rendezvous has an overall shape like that of an SUV. The crossover model features details that promote a youthful image. Sharp lines take precedence over curves, and a fastback rear slope is said to be less boxy than a typical SUVs back end.\n\nStyling elements that are common on other Buicks are evident on the Rendezvous. The SUVs front features an oval-shaped grille that is painted rather than trimmed in chrome. Chrome is used minimally throughout. An accent ring surrounds the center tri-shield emblem, and headlights with detailing around their lenses sit deep in the front fascia.\n\nThe Rendezvous eight-spoke 16-inch wheels are similar to the ones used on other Buick vehicles, but this SUVs wheel design is aggressive. The top portion of the vehicle is considered more refined. The lower body gets a more rugged blacked-out appearance, which emphasizes the fact that its design combines the attributes of a premium sedan with those of a versatile SUV. Two-tone side cladding wraps around the entire vehicle. The Rendezvous rides a 112.2-inch wheelbase, measures 186.5 inches long overall and stands 68.9 inches tall (not including the roof rack).\n\nInterior\nThe Rendezvous seats five occupants in standard form, and its reconfigurable interior may be equipped with third-row seats that hold two more occupants. The front buckets hold two people, and the second row can have a three-place split bench seat or two captains chairs; footrests are optional. Buick says the second-row seats flip and fold to give access to the optional third-row seats, which results in a seven-passenger capacity. The seats fold down to yield a cargo volume of 108.9 cubic feet, and a 4-by-8-foot panel can be loaded through the back door.\n\nLow doorsills are intended to ease entry and exit. A two-tone interior comes in either leather, flat-woven cloth with leather bolsters or all-cloth with pile fabric. Instrument-cluster detailing is said to produce what Buick calls a look of precious stones set in polished metal, with the needles and numbers set into a silver face. The center console can hold a full-size laptop computer, and it has a special area for stowing a purse.\n\nDriver amenities include an automatic locking and unlocking feature for the doors, a tire-inflation monitor that illuminates if low tire pressure occurs and an ultrasonic intrusion-alert system that can detect movement inside the vehicle while it is locked. An optional Ultrasonic Rear Park Assist system uses sensors to warn the driver of obstacles to the rear while the vehicle is backing up. A driver information center is included in the CXL model. GMs OnStar communication system is a factory-installed option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 185-horsepower, 3.4-liter V-6 engine generates 210 pounds-feet of torque and teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Versatrak on-demand AWD is standard on the upscale CXL model and offered as an option on the CX. No action is needed to engage the AWD system. The Rendezvous can haul up to 3,500 pounds when it is equipped with the available towing package.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and all-disc antilock brakes were standard on the 2002 Rendezvous but are now offered as optional equipment.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDespite structural similarities to the wildly styled, slow-selling Pontiac Aztek, Buicks crossover SUV has an appearance and personality all of its own. The Rendezvous looks essentially like a Buick that happens to have a minivan/SUV type of body behind the familiar-shaped grille.\n\nThe excellent automatic-transmission responses are quick and easy, and acceleration is good, if not exactly inspiring. The Rendezvous runs very quietly and offers plenty of versatile space in a distinctive interior. Its gauges are especially notable in appearance, though theyre not the easiest to read at a glance.\n\nThe Rendezvous offers a generally soft ride, but the suspension hits some bumps rather hard. It tends to overreact to modest undulations in the pavement and causes a little too much motion for its occupants; the SUV creates excessively noticeable responses to bad spots. The Rendezvous handling is undeniably minivanlike; it is reasonably precise with good steering feel and feedback.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/5/03",
