      "expert_review": "The Century is history, and the Regal has been retired … So, if you want a new Buick midsize sedan, LaCrosse is your game. Buick’s all-new 2005 LaCrosse is nothing like the rough-and-tumble game played by racket-wielding, helmet-wearing players on an open field. From bumper to bumper, Buick’s LaCrosse is softer, kinder and gentler.\n\nAnd after a week of driving the CXS, which is the top-of-the-heap LaCrosse of three trim levels offered, I’d say it’s better than the old Buick Century and Regal it replaced.\n\nLet’s start with styling. The Centuryoften was criticized as too vanilla-looking, and the Regal’s edgy looks came off as too over-the-top for some. By comparison, the LaCrosse looks like a happy compromise between the two extremes. A bold, oval-shaped grille is decidedly Buick, but the shape starts rounding off at the LaCrosse headlamps. Fit and finish on the tester were superb, and a practical-size trunklid opened up on a surprisingly roomy trunk – 16 cubic feet. OK, that’s not the 21.2-cubic-foot cavern in the back of the 2005 Ford Five Hundred, but the LaCrosse can comfortably handle the baggage of typical midsize passenger car buyers.\n\nBecause the car wears a Buick badge, you expect a certain level of class and sophistication when you step inside, and you get that with the LaCrosse. The tester had standard leather seating surfaces, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone climate control and a six-speaker audio system that more than filled the cabin with quality sound.\n\nThose shiny, 17-inch wheels with the Buick logo in the center looked pretty sharp, too.\n\nThe CXS also had attractive wood trim appointments and a center stack of controls that could be mastered in minutes. The tester was a five-seater, but Buick is touting the availability of six-seat occupancy in its LaCrosse.\n\nMaybe it works for some, but I had real trouble picturing six adults compressed in the LaCrosse cabin. Better make sure everyone really likes each other if you go the six-passenger route.\n\nThe CXS was dressed up with a somewhat gaudy package of options that included steering wheel-mounted audio/climate controls, power mirrors (with heat and folding capability), a power sunroof and XM Satellite Radio. All this added nearly $5,000 to the window sticker’s bottom line.\n\nAs much as I love XM satellite radio, I asked myself if I could still like this car without all the extra goodies. Yes, I could … especially given its surprising performance characteristics.\n\nThe LaCrosse CXS gets the smaller but more powerful 3.6-liter V-6 engine with 240 horsepower. (The less-costly CX and CXL come with a standard 3.8-liter V-6 with 200 horses).\n\nThe 3.6-liter, all-aluminum power plant gets its extra bite from variable valve timing and a dual-overhead-cam arrangement. It has good pop, but the surprise comes with big-time torque at low revs – an advertised 225 foot-pounds coming in at 2,000 revolutions per minute.\n\nI did not expect this kind of low-end muscle from a Buick midsize sedan, but I quickly got used to slipping into traffic holes on the freeway and easily clearing surface-street traffic when stoplights beamed green.\n\nSo, who lied about the gas mileage? And I mean that in a good way.\n\nThe fuel economy numbers on the LaCrosse sticker read 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. For reasons that remain a mystery, I was getting 3 mpg better than both of those numbers.\n\nThe federal government has been taking a lot of heat on several fronts for conducting outdated fuel economy testing and releasing allegedly inflated gas-mileage numbers. But, at least in the LaCrosse I drove, the numbers went the other way. Go figure.\n\nOh, Buick goes on and on about construction technology and building materials that bounce noise away from the passenger cabin. Acoustic insulation was not one of my strong classes in college, but the LaCrosse did roll along quite quietly.\n\nHere’s a gripe that won’t go away: If I had been the king of Buick, I would have equipped LaCrosse with a five-speed automatic gearbox instead of the four-speed, the better to enjoy the advantages of that robust, 240-horsepower V-6 engine.\n\nSo, it boils down to whether to drop $25,000 to $30,000 on a General Motors Corp. midsize sedan when there are so many tempting, full-size passenger cars out there for only a few dollars more.\n\nThat’s a tough call … and a personal one. But the LaCrosse definitely deserves at least a test drive in any passenger car shopping expedition. You might be pleasantly surprised that less adds up to more.\n\nThat’s the appeal of the new LaCrosse – understated in so many of the right places, but aggressive in performance and handling.\n\nBuick LaCrosse at a glance Make/model: 2005 Buick LaCrosse CXS.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWith the introduction of the LaCrosse sedan last year, Buick replaced both the family-focused Century and the sportier Regal, effectively reducing its midsize lineup from two vehicles to one. The front-wheel-drive LaCrosse features a modern look and an available aluminum V-6 engine. For 2006, several safety features become standard.\n\nThree versions are offered — the CX, the midlevel CXL and the performance-oriented CXS — and two engine choices are available. Three levels of traction control, including General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system, are offered. “QuietTuning” features include acoustical laminate on the windshield and front side glass and “Quiet Steel” laminate in front of the dash. The LaCrosse is the first Buick that can be equipped with both a factory-installed remote starter and remote-operated climate control.\n\nExterior\nA larger, more modern rendition of Buick’s familiar elliptical vertical-bar grille is fitted on the LaCrosse, and it’s flanked by dual headlights. Sculpted forms in the hood sweep back toward the windshield. Jewellike headlights and taillights, along with chrome body accents, are installed. Buick claims that the LaCrosse’s headlight performance is 35 percent greater than the Century’s and Regal’s. Amber side marker lights are integrated into the outer lenses, which taper into the front fenders. CXS models include projector fog lamps.\n\nIn contrast to the Century and Regal, which had rear quarter windows in the back doors, the LaCrosse has these windows in the C-pillars. Buick says these crescent-shaped windows help reduce blind spots in the car. Rocker panels on CX models have a grained graphite finish, while those on the CXL and CXS have a glossy, body-colored finish. Chrome door handles are used on the CXS sedan.\n\nCompared with the departed Regal, the LaCrosse has revised suspension tuning. Rebound damper bumpers are four times longer for improved cushioning, and the power steering has been retuned. With the standard suspension, the springs are about 20 percent stiffer than before, with higher-rate front and rear stabilizers. The CXS comes standard with a Gran Touring suspension.\n\nThe wheels measure 16 inches in diameter on the CX and CXL and 17 inches on the CXS. A power sunroof is optional. Built on a 110.5-inch wheelbase, the LaCrosse is 198.1 inches long overall.\n\nInterior\nLaCrosse sedans come in either a five- or six-passenger configuration. Five-passenger models have a console-mounted gearshift lever and a center armrest. Six-passenger sedans have a column-mounted gearshift and a “flip and fold” seatback cushion that can double as an armrest and storage bin. A 60/40-split, folding rear seatback is standard in the CXL and CXS models and optional in the CX.\n\nCloth seats are installed in the CX, but the CXL and CXS have leather seating surfaces. The steering wheel in the CXS has standard tilt and telescoping adjustments. Trunk capacity is 16 cubic feet.\n\nGM’s OnStar communication system and a PassLock III theft-deterrent system are standard. Other standard equipment includes remote keyless entry, a power driver’s seat, power windows and locks, and a six-speaker stereo with a CD player. Heated seats, XM Satellite Radio, and auxiliary audio and climate controls on the steering wheel are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe CX and CXL models use a 3.8-liter V-6 engine that produces 200 horsepower and 230 pounds-feet of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 with variable valve timing goes into the CXS and delivers 240 hp and 225 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nFor 2006, all-disc antilock brakes and side curtain-type airbags are standard. GM’s StabiliTrak and Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcceleration is pleasantly energetic with the 3.6-liter V-6 in the CXS model. The LaCrosse is a highly traditional Buick, which could be good or bad depending on one’s tastes. This sedan is easy to drive. Overall, the LaCrosse is surprisingly similar in personality to the old Park Avenue.\n\nTransmission shifts are sometimes noticeable, but not annoying. Other than a mild growl when pushed hard, the smaller V-6 is very quiet.\n\nThe ride is generally gentle due to the soft suspension, but the LaCrosse can hit some bumps and holes rather hard. That softness also translates to considerable understeer and imprecise handling.\n\nFront-seat space is bountiful, but backseat headroom and legroom are marginal. Visibility is good due to the amount of glass in this car. The controls are mostly sensible, but some are marked with cryptic icons. Some instruments — especially the fuel and temperature gauges — are somewhat difficult to read at a glance.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2007, several new luxury features become standard on Buick’s midsize sedan, including General Motors’ OnStar Turn-by-Turn navigation system.\n\nThree versions of the LaCrosse are offered — the CX, the midlevel CXL and the performance-oriented CXS — and two engine choices are available. Three levels of traction control, including General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system, are offered. “QuietTuning” features include acoustical laminate on the windshield and front side glass and “Quiet Steel” laminate in front of the dash. The LaCrosse is the first Buick that can be equipped with both a factory-installed remote starter and remote-operated climate control.\n\nExterior\nFour new exterior colors are available in 2007: Midnight Blue Metallic, Stone Gray Metallic, Midnight Amethyst Metallic and Red Jewel Tintcoat. There is also a new steering wheel.\n\nBuick’s familiar elliptical vertical-bar grille is fitted on the LaCrosse, and it’s flanked by dual headlights. Sculpted forms in the hood sweep back toward the windshield. Jewel-like headlights and taillights, along with chrome body accents, are installed. Amber side marker lights are integrated into the outer lenses, which taper into the front fenders. CXS models include projector fog lamps.\n\nThe LaCrosse has rear quarter windows in the C-pillars, which Buick says help reduce blind spots in the car. Rocker panels on CX models have a grained graphite finish, while those on the CXL and CXS have a glossy, body-colored finish. Chrome door handles are used on the CXS sedan.\n\nThe wheels measure 16 inches in diameter on the CX and 17 inches on the CXL and CXS. The CXS now offers 12-spoke chrome aluminum wheels or 12-spoke wheels. Ten-spoke flangeless chrome tech wheels are available on the CXL. A power sunroof is optional. Built on a 110.5-inch wheelbase, the LaCrosse is 198.1 inches long overall.\n\nInterior\nLaCrosse sedans come in either a five- or six-passenger configuration. Five-passenger models have a console-mounted gearshift lever and a center armrest. Six-passenger sedans have a column-mounted gearshift and a “flip and fold” seatback cushion that can double as an armrest and storage bin. A 60/40-split, folding rear seatback is standard in CXL and CXS models and optional in the CX.\n\nCloth seats are installed in the CX, while the CXL and CXS have leather seating surfaces. The steering wheel in the CXS has standard tilt and telescoping adjustments. Trunk capacity is 16 cubic feet.\n\nStandard equipment includes PassLock III theft-deterrent system, remote keyless entry, a power driver’s seat, power windows and locks, and a six-speaker stereo with a CD player. Heated seats, XM Satellite Radio, and auxiliary audio and climate controls on the steering wheel are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nCX and CXL models use a 3.8-liter V-6 engine that produces 200 horsepower and 230 pounds-feet of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 with variable valve timing goes into the CXS and delivers 240 hp and 225 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines team with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side curtain airbags are standard, and GM’s StabiliTrak and Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist are optional.",

      "expert_review": "In answer to all those Buick customers clamoring for a high-performance version of the LaCrosse, we present the 2008 Buick LaCrosse Super.\n\nWhat? You haven’t heard that clamor? Whew! We haven’t either, but we thought we just were listening to the wrong AM radio stations.\n\nRolling out as a 2005 model, essentially replacing both the Century and Regal, the LaCrosse was offered with a 3.8-liter, 205-horsepower V-6, or a more modern, peppier 3.6-liter, 240-horse V-6. A handsome, competent car that neither excels nor fails in any important area, the LaCrosse was a success.\n\nBut sales of the LaCrosse have sagged since its introduction — Buick sold about 6,000 of them last August, down nearly 2,000 from August 2006 — so the company looked for a way to inject a little excitement into a car that no one, even die-hard LaCrosse fans, would categorize as “exciting.”\n\nThis calls for more engine, Buick decided, likely a two-step thought process:\n\nOne: We have a lot of 5.3-liter V-8 engines.\n\nTwo: And they seem to fit!\n\nNever one to look gift horsepower in the mouth, I applaud the addition of the 300-horse V-8, an excellent engine which works just as well in a Buick as it does in a Chevrolet pickup truck, even if the horses are saddled with a four-speed automatic transmission instead of a more up-to-date six-speed. The V-8 in the LaCrosse makes this the LaCrosse Super, sort of a deluxe version of the Chevy Impala SS for about $3,000 more.\n\nIt also makes the LaCrosse Super slightly thirstier: EPA ratings are 16 miles per gallon city, 24 mpg highway. The LaCrosse with the 3.8-liter V-6 is rated at 17/28, and with the 3.6-liter V-6, 17/25. And the V-8 makes the LaCrosse Super heavier by about 200 pounds, most of which is unfortunately on its nose.\n\nThat’s all the bad news. The good news is: Punch the throttle, and the LaCrosse Super feels like your father’s Buick, and I mean that in a good way — authoritative acceleration, nice burbling exhaust note. There is some torque steer under hard acceleration — that’s the tendency, in a front-wheel-drive car, for the engine’s power to steer the wheels slightly — but it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe Super starts at $31,310, which is $4,000 more than the LaCrosse CXL, previously the most expensive model. The Super has lots of standard equipment plus a few exclusive features, such as the “leather-appointed seats with Dream Weave inserts,” and a “rear aero wing” spoiler.\n\nThe LaCrosse Super won’t steal sales from the Chevy Corvette, but it might bring a few former Corvette owners back to the GM fold.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2009 about the 2010 Buick LaCrosse. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nBuick’s goals with each new car seem the same: Get less stodgy and attract younger buyers. The redesigned LaCrosse’s insipid TV ads may not help the cause, but the car they feature should. The LaCrosse is comfortable, luxurious and easily the best-looking Buick since the Clinton administration. More important, Buick didn’t turn it into a sport sedan — something no one ever asked of the brand, and a temptation I’m glad GM didn’t give in to.\n\nSo did the General accomplish its mission? I’d like to think so. I’m in my 20s, and I want one.\n\nTrim levels for the LaCrosse include the base CX, CXL and more-powerful CXS. All-wheel drive is optional on the CXL. With this redesign, the LaCrosse moves to a new platform from last year’s Chevrolet Impala-based model. I test-drove all three trim levels of the 2010 version; you can compare it to the 2009 version here.\n\nA Better-Looking Buick\nDesigned mostly in China, where Buick enjoys strong sales, the LaCrosse is an exercise in well-proportioned grace. The front juts out enough that it should give the car an ungainly, pancaked appearance, but GM still gets away with it. I can’t quite explain how, except to say the car’s face hides the overhang in a way the outgoing LaCrosse’s bulbous nose could not. I’m no aesthete; I just know when a car looks right, and the new LaCrosse does. You might disagree, but 10 bucks says that most of you won’t. (Actually, I make a journalist’s salary. Let’s make that five bucks.)\n\nAll versions of the LaCrosse get chrome accents on the door handles, trunk and grille. Unfortunately, they also get Buick’s signature portholes, moved to an awkward perch atop the hood. Most onlookers agreed — these faux engine vents hurt an otherwise sharp design.\n\nOn the Road\nThe LaCrosse moves out when pushed, but its capabilities stop short of an all-out sport sedan’s — fine by me, seeing as no one ever wanted Buick to build the next BMW. The LaCrosse CXS, which packs the 3.6-liter V-6 from GM’s three-row crossover SUVs, moves about as swiftly from stoplights as Lexus’ ES 350, which is to say its power is strong but not quite effortless.\n\nThe CXS’ six-speed automatic transmission handles upshifts smoothly; it kicks down with a slight delay but picks a gear and stays there, allowing uninterrupted passing power when you need it. In comparison, the ES 350’s automatic seems to hunt for the right gear.\n\nThe LaCrosse CX and CXL get a smaller 3.0-liter V-6, also with a six-speed auto. Highway passing power is similar to what the CXS can muster, but getting up there takes a bit more time, as there’s less immediate power available when the light turns green.\n\nThe more noticeable difference comes with all-wheel drive. It’s available only on the CXL, and it adds just 180 pounds — fairly light, as all-wheel-drive systems go — but that’s enough to reduce passing power noticeably. Buick says the CXL received all-wheel drive at the car’s introduction because it’s the LaCrosse’s top-selling trim level. I’d like to see the CXS and its larger V-6 offer it soon; all-wheel-drive buyers could certainly use the extra oomph.\n\nA four-cylinder engine will be available late this year in the LaCrosse CX. At GM’s media preview, there were no four-cylinders available to test, but once we get one I’ll add my impressions. Buick says EPA gas mileage should work out to about 20/30 mpg city/highway — better than any immediate competitor, though none of them offer four-cylinder engines.\n\nWith front-wheel drive, the 3.0-liter V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 17/26 mpg. That’s comparable to the mileage in an Acura TL or Lincoln MKZ, if a bit short of the ES. On the upside, Buick says its drivetrains run fine on regular fuel. The ES recommends premium, and the TL requires it. This will save drivers money at the pump.\n\nThe EPA hasn’t listed official figures for other trims, but Buick’s estimates have the all-wheel-drive LaCrosse’s mileage dropping to 16/26 mpg (comparable to the all-wheel-drive TL and MKZ) and the 3.6-liter V-6 coming in at 17/27 mpg. Buick also estimated the 3.0-liter at 17/27, though, so don’t be surprised if it comes down to 17/26 when the EPA chimes in with its rating.\n\nCruising, Turning & Stopping\nRide comfort is still king at Buick, and it’s a formula GM shouldn’t change. The LaCrosse leaves manhole covers and steel plates behind with the sort of measured wump that you’ll notice but won’t care much about. Taut suspensions are all the rage these days; cars like the Lincoln MKS, Nissan Altima and Mercury Milan ride on the firm side. It’s nice to see Buick held the line.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with Lexus-like smoothness; in parking lots, turning is a two-fingered affair.\n\nThere’s noticeable steering play at 12 o’clock on the highway, though, so you’ll have to get used to making periodic course corrections. On curvier roads, handling isn’t as razor-sharp as a genuine sport sedan — there’s more steering slop and body roll on curvy roads, for example, than in a TL or Infiniti G37 — but Buick fans may find this a step in the more athletic direction.\n\nThe LaCrosse CXS offers an $800 Touring Package that adds an adaptive suspension and swaps the standard 18-inch wheels for 19s. It also incorporates a Sport mode. While in Drive in a LaCrosse equipped with the Touring Package, ride quality wasn’t noticeably better than non-Touring suspensions. Road noise is more noticeable, going from whisper-silent with the lower trim levels’ 17- and 18-inch wheels to noticeable with the Touring Package’s 19-inchers.\n\nActivate Sport mode in a LaCrosse with the Touring Package, and the suspension dials in firmer settings, the automatic holds low gears longer to maximize acceleration, and the steering reduces power assist. On twisty roads, the LaCrosse stays markedly flatter in corners, but in town you’ll want to move the gearshift back to Drive, otherwise patches of rough pavement will find their way to your backside a bit easier.\n\nThe lessened power-steering assist in Sport mode also alleviates some of that highway steering play, and the effect makes for a more settled, planted sensation, with fewer course corrections needed. The wheel remains easy enough to turn at lower speeds, too. Buick ought to have standardized Sport mode’s steering calibrations across all trims.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but the pedal doesn’t elicit a particularly strong response. Under hard braking, the car’s nose dives excessively.\n\nThe Inside\nLike the pricier CTS sedan from sister brand Cadillac, the LaCrosse’s dashboard is trimmed in a leather-like material with stitched seams and padded finishes. Ambient lighting pipes across the dashboard at night, and the woven headliner material extends down the window pillars. These are small details, but they go a long way toward convincing those with sticker shock that Buick’s midsize sedan’s price premium is deserved. It’s just north of a well-equipped Chevy Malibu, but still well south of the base CTS.\n\nOptions include a heated steering wheel, a rear-window power sunshade, and heated and ventilated front seats. That makes for a lot of center controls to sort through; get all the toys, and the dash has more sprawl than Los Angeles County. There’s still quite a spread even in base models without those options, and their white-on-silver finish washes out in sunlight. On the upside, GM’s stereo setup is as user-friendly as always, with on-screen labels for your favorite radio stations — i.e., “93.1” or “104.3” instead of “preset 1” or “preset 2” — and the ability to program AM, FM and satellite radio stations into the same list of presets.\n\nAs in the CTS, a radio recording system is optional. The version in the LaCrosse buffers up to 30 minutes of AM, FM or satellite radio, allowing you to pause, rewind and fast-forward in TiVo-like fashion. The convenience possibilities are promising — you could pause the game to run into the store, for example — but you’d have to leave the keys in the ignition; Buick says the system resets the buffer when you turn the car off. Bummer. The standard yearly subscription to OnStar’s Directions and Connections plan includes turn-by-turn navigation. If you want a map, the optional in-dash navigation system — it’s GM’s latest generation — has excellent graphics and quick response: Zoom in on the map or jump to a submenu, and it happens now. After all these years, I’d become accustomed to navigation systems taking a second or two to react.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nThe standard eight-way power driver’s seat offers plenty of adjustment range, so spouses of wide-ranging sizes should have no trouble finding their fit. If you’re much taller than 6 feet, avoid the optional dual-pane moonroof, as it cuts headroom significantly. At 5-foot-11, I found the driver’s seat roomy enough, and the optional leather seats have enough side bolstering to provide un-Buick-like levels of curvy-road support without being so sculpted that it’s hard to slide into the car. On the flip side, I found the driver’s seat had too much lumbar support even with it dialed back to zero, and a vertical seam in the backrest kept digging into my spine. The cloth seats in the LaCrosse CX don’t have these issues, and they’re exceptionally comfortable. They’re less expensive, too.\n\nLess comfortable is the backseat: Legroom and headroom are good, but the seat sits too low to the ground to provide adult-sized thigh support. It’s a more generous setup than small luxury cars like the Acura TSX or BMW 3 Series, but others in this price range — particularly the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord — have roomier confines.\n\nThe trunk has a narrow opening, made narrower on both sides by trunklid supports. At any rate, it’s not particularly roomy: Overall volume, at 13.3 cubic feet in the CX and CXL, leads the TL (13.1 cubic feet) but trails the ES 350 (14.7) and MKZ (16.5). Subwoofers for the upgraded stereo, which is standard on the CXS, reduce volume to 12.8 cubic feet.\n\nFeatures & Safety\nThe LaCrosse has yet to be crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and six airbags. Seat-mounted backseat side airbags are optional, raising the airbag total to eight. A blind-spot warning system and adaptive cornering headlights, which automatically swivel a few degrees to illuminate upcoming curves when you turn the steering wheel, are optional. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe V-6-powered LaCrosse CX starts at $27,085, though the introduction of a four-cylinder CX later this year will likely lower that figure. Standard features include a power driver’s seat, single-zone automatic climate control and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack and steering-wheel audio controls. CXL models ($29,645) add leather upholstery, alloy wheels, a power passenger seat, dual-zone climate control and heated front seats; all-wheel drive runs an extra $2,175. The CXS ($33,015) adds the larger V-6, rear parking assist, Harman Kardon audio and a slew of other luxury features. Most of them are optional on the CXL.\n\nAdditional options include a panoramic moonroof, a navigation system with a backup camera, xenon headlights and a backseat DVD system with a screen behind each front-seat head restraint. Load up the LaCrosse, and the sticker ends up around $41,000.\n\nLaCrosse in the Market\nThe LaCrosse isn’t a product of the yesteryear thinking that drove GM to build a competitor to whatever Lincoln was building across town. That’s the sort of culture that got GM into trouble in the first place. Susan Docherty, vice president of Buick, GMC and the soon-to-be erstwhile Pontiac, told journalists at the LaCrosse introduction that the car must make Buick “relevant to people in their 40s and 50s.” Right now, typical Buick buyers are in their 70s, Docherty said.\n\nThe LaCrosse has potential to change this. Let’s just hope it proves dependable: So many promising GM products, from the redesigned CTS to the company’s three-row crossovers, have received sour reliability scores a year or two out of the gate. Others, like the Chevy Malibu, have done better — and the LaCrosse rolls off the Malibu’s Kansas City assembly line. I’m keeping my fingers crossed, because Buick has a heck of a car here.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "As I get older, it’s getting harder and harder to surprise me, so Buick deserves a golf-clap-style round of applause for accomplishing this difficult task. The 2010 Buick LaCrosse wowed me by living up to all its hype. The new design is modern and curvy. Its exterior looks much less geriatric than past models, and it maintains a roomy interior that’s defifnitely about comfort and style. The LaCrosse is a comfortable family midsize sedan that will appeal to parents looking for a little luxury in their lives.\n\nThis car is a game-changer for Buick. It’s loaded with details, from a lovely faux wood trim to an illuminated band, which is visible only at nighttime, that extends across the dash. While it does seem to be a little excessive (as do some other LaCrosse design elements), it indicates that Buick is serious about being a younger, updated brand.\n\nThe LaCrosse has a V-6 engine that seemed a bit lackadaisical when I first started driving this test car. Then I realized I was driving it lackadaisically. Once I put a more aggressive spin on my driving style, the LaCrosse responded in kind.\n\nA base LaCrosse has an MSRP of $26,245. My test car, a CXL with all-whfeel drive, started at $31,820. It had the Comfort & Convenience Package 2 and the Luxury Package, and the price went up to $35,865.00.\n\nEXTERIOR\nBuick’s geriatric look and feel is gone. If you had no prior knowledge of Buick’s reputation as the favorite car of grandparents, you wouldn’t worry about people thinking you like early-bird specials and canasta if they saw you in the 2010 LaCrosse. That’s because this car is a hottie. It’s sleek, with curves in all the right spots, and it strikes a nice balance. It looks good from every angle.\n\nI appreciated this car’s thoughtful details such as the trim on the thresholds, heated (and auto-dimming on the driver’s side) side mirrors and a keyless entry system, which means I only had to have the key fob in my purse or pocket to unlock the car’s doors. There were a few chrome details, such as the chrome portholes on the LaCrosse’s exterior, that felt a little over the top, and the grille struck me as too busy with all the slats and the large Buick logo.\n\nMy kids liked this car because it was so darn easy for them to use. They found the doors to be easy to open and close, but it should be noted that my son grew 2½ inches this year and has turned 8. My daughter is 6 but almost as tall as her brother. A younger child will probably need to be assisted, but you probably aren’t surprised by that.\n\nWith a 252-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, my test LaCrosse could really move. It also had all-wheel drive, so it got an EPA-estimated 16/26 mpg city/highway, which is 1 mpg lower than the front-wheel-drive version.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times-Groove On\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great-Excellent\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe LaCrosse’s interior is terrific. It looks luxurious, and I truly enjoyed being in the car. The quiet cabin was another huge plus for me. When I’m surrounded by kid noise all the time, it’s wonderful to have a quiet retreat where the only noise is silence.\n\nThe leather seats are comfortable and supportive. Between all of the power adjustments and the tilt/telescoping steering wheel, I found my perfect fit in the driver’s seat. My whole family was comfortable in the LaCrosse, with a roomy cabin that felt bright and open. This five-seater is so roomy that it could actually hold three people in its backseat. Also great is the backseat’s legroom. I wouldn’t hesitate to take long trips in this car because even my 6-foot husband was able to spread out in the front passenger seat without squishing anyone in the backseat.\n\nMy favorite feature was the head-up display. I loved being able to see the car’s speed all the time without having to lower my gaze to the instruments. With the push of a button, the display also could show rpm and radio station information. If I changed the station, the display would briefly change to show me what I’d selected and then go back to the speed setting. I could move the display up or down and adjust the brightness to my liking.\n\nThere are faux wood accents across the center stack, and the front row’s cupholders sit under retractable covers. The back row also has two cupholders with knuckles that adjusted to the cup size. They work well with small cups, juice boxes or bottles. However, bottleholders are noticeably absent in this five-seater.\n\nLet’s talk about the trunk. It’s huge. During my test drive, it held a slew of grocery bags without balking. I was impressed. The trunk has a pass-through to the cabin for longer items, and the backseat folds in a 60/40 split for even more room.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2010 LaCrosse has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this award, a car must get the highest score of Good in front, side, rear and rollover crash tests as well as have standard stability control.\n\nThe LaCrosse’s other standard safety features include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include side-impact airbags for the backseat ($350), a backup camera, a blind spot warning system and all-wheel drive.\n\nWhen it comes to child-safety seats, the LaCrosse’s flat bench seat is awesome. There are no seat bolsters to interfere with the car-seat fit. However, the lower Latch anchors were hard to get to because they were wedged under the seat cushions. The backseat’s seat belts also were problematic because the buckles were buried in the seat cushion. This would be tough for little hands and tempers to deal with.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 LaCrosse here.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse’s interior remains firmly in the near-luxury class, rather than taking the next leap in quality, but the LaCrosse drives like a luxury car many times more expensive than it is.\n\nVersus the competition: The LaCrosse’s exceedingly comfortable ride with 18-inch wheels is refreshing considering how many near-luxury competitors want to be the sporty type and end up being neither sporty nor comfortable.\n\nThe 2017 Buick LaCrosse is about as all-new as you can get without slapping a new name on the trunk. The retooling of the platform and everything above it has transformed the 2017 LaCrosse into one of the quietest sedans this side of a Mercedes S-Class. And when properly equipped, the LaCrosse is much more than a wallowing, numb-driving geriatric special; it showcases a surprisingly capable driving experience that matches its sleek new look.\n\nRelated: 2017 Buick LaCrosse: First Look\nExterior & Styling\nThis new LaCrosse looks very different from the snooze-fest it replaces. Longer, lower and wider dimensions give the LaCrosse a considerably sleeker appearance. And, boy, is it long. At 197.5 inches from bumper to bumper, it’s 4.2 inches longer than a Lexus ES 350, 4.7 inches longer than a Nissan Maxima and 7.2 inches longer than an Acura TLX. Compare the LaCrosse’s specs to those of its competitors here.\n\nThe new LaCrosse looks massive driving down the road despite being as much as 297 pounds lighter than the outgoing one (compare the 2017 with the 2016 here). Notable highlights of the exterior redesign include the new Buick “tri-shield” insignia on the grille and trunk. It’s painted red, silver and blue and gives a nice pop of color to an otherwise conservative collection of exterior color choices.\nHow It Drives\nThere are essentially two types of LaCrosse to be had: Sporty Spice and Old Spice. Versions with 20-inch wheels include a unique adaptive suspension for a sportier drive, while cars with the 18-inch combo are the more traditional, comfortable-driving car to which current LaCrosse owners will be accustomed. These 20- and 18-inch wheel packages are the equivalent of Sport and Touring trims, respectively, and both use a new 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. LaCrosse trims include Standard ($32,990 with destination charge), Preferred ($36,990) and Essence ($39,590), which are front-wheel drive, and the top trim, Premium ($41,990), which can be had with front-wheel drive or a new twin-clutch AWD system ($2,200) that’s able to split torque both front to rear and between the left and right rear wheels for improved handling.\n\nGM-Buick invited us to drive both versions in Portland, Ore. — home to some of the loudest pavement in the country, with coarse, sandpaper-like highways that pour gritty road noise into the cabin for miles. The LaCrosse development team targeted the Lexus ES 350 for performance benchmarks in noise levels, and the LaCrosse was the quieter, better-driving car of the two any way they’re sliced. The Buick’s new, stronger platform is 297 pounds lighter than that of the outgoing LaCrosse and has a longer wheelbase and wider track, meaning the 2017 is a thoroughly different car from the outgoing LaCrosse.\n\nThe real surprise of the show is the LaCrosse’s optional 20-inch wheel package ($1,625), which is much more than simply a tire and wheel combo: It pairs with Buick’s Continuous Damping Control adaptive suspension, which is available on Essence and Premium trims. With it, drivers can choose between a comfortable, soft suspension (Touring mode) or stiffer, performance-tuned damping in Sport mode that heightens handling and backroad fun. The ES 350, Acura TLX and Nissan Maxima can’t match that kind of ride-quality customization because they lack adjustable suspension firmness. Lincoln’s MKZ has an adjustable-firmness suspension, however, and it’s standard equipment. \n\nLaCrosses with the 20-inch wheels unleash their most-proficient handling in Sport mode, where increased suspension firmness flattens out handling and increases turn-in responsiveness to the point where it’s entertaining to drive the car spiritedly, even if that’s not something that will come naturally to most owners. Sport mode also increases steering wheel weighting, holds lower transmission gears longer and transfers more lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels in AWD models.\n\nA LaCrosse with 18-inch wheels, though, is a car you can spend hours driving without a flinch of a lower back spasm. There’s no Sport mode — not even for transmission or steering tuning — and the supple ride of the fixed-firmness suspension is specifically tuned to the wheel and tire package. The 18-inch tires have taller sidewalls than the 20-inch wheels to better absorb road imperfections.\n\nWith the 18s, I couldn’t hear a whisper from the engine and caught only a faint, distant whistling of the wind over the side mirrors. Standard active noise cancelling and a host of features in Buick’s “Quiet Tuning” strategy — including an acoustic-laminated windshield and front-door windows — keep the cabin quiet, and a new five-link rear suspension improves road noise isolation over the previous, four-link rear suspension design. Traveling over a freshly paved highway at 60 mph in a car with the 18-inch package, you could have told me I was driving an electric car — that’s how quiet the new LaCrosse can be.\nInterior\nThe LaCrosse’s optional leather-appointed front seats replace the standard leatherette (imitation leather) upholstery and are supportive and plush; their design and stitching are among the interior’s highlights, especially when you choose the classy brandy leather color. Premium trims have a massaging lumbar function, though it’s mostly a novelty, with only a shred of the range that higher-end massaging systems have. For rear passengers, the seatback rests at a slightly reclined angle and provides a comfortable position, with cushioning as soft as the front. At 6 feet tall I didn’t have any problem with headroom or legroom, but a slightly taller editor found backseat headroom limited. \n\nThe rest of the interior quality doesn’t do much to pull the LaCrosse out of the “near-luxury” category Buick shares with Acura and Lincoln. The nicely appointed ES 350 and even the Maxima have an edge over it in materials quality and luxurious styling. Holding the LaCrosse back is faux wood trim plastered in highly visible areas of the interior, plus low-grade paneling and pockets below the door handle that look straight from a non-luxury compact or midsize sedan. \n\nAn even more questionable inclusion is the new electronic gear selector. Like the Cadillac XT5 SUV that shares it, the selector layout takes time to learn. In my opinion, if you have to pause, think about it or get used to it, the setup has unneeded complexity. The space this electronic lever frees up under the center console is useful, but I found the gear engagement unsatisfying and frequently questioned which gear I’d chosen. The slender gear selector also hasn’t narrowed the front center console any, and the LaCrosse’s large, tall console with gear selector, cupholders and storage bin contributes to the car feeling small for front occupants despite its large exterior dimensions and wide backseat.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIf you can look past the fact that the LaCrosse’s materials aren’t as rich as that of a Lexus, you’ll be treated to desirable multimedia features. The large touch-screen is complemented by tuning buttons and a volume knob instead of gimmicky touch-sensitive capacitive buttons, and the always-welcome Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.\n\nIn-car Wi-Fi with an OnStar 4G LTE data plan is ripe for using phones, tablets and laptops in the car. The first three months or 3 gigabytes of data is included before a monthly plan is required to keep the service going. Plans start at $10 a month for 1 GB of data. Two USB ports up front and an AC household outlet in the back on Premium trims supply power for long trips.\nCargo & Storage\nThe LaCrosse has 15 cubic feet of trunk space, which is up from 13.3 cubic feet in the outgoing LaCrosse. The new trunk can fit four bags of golf clubs rather than the old car’s three. Pressing the Buick insignia unlatches the trunk (in lieu of a release near the license plate or under the trunk lip). There’s also a split, folding backseat to fit longer items. While a folding backseat may seem like a no-brainer inclusion, some large sedans, like the Lexus ES 350 and related Toyota Avalon, only offer small pass-through openings in a fixed backseat. Folding the LaCrosse’s backseat is a cinch, with releases in the trunk for either side.\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the LaCrosse hasn’t been crash-tested. Go here to see a full list of standard safety features. Available safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nA standard teen driver feature provides a driving report card for parents: In-car alerts can be set for predetermined speeds, while Bluetooth phone and audio from the stereo can be muted when the front seat belts aren’t fastened.\nValue in Its Class\nThanks to the LaCrosse’s noticeable shortcoming in interior quality, the 2017 isn’t a serious luxury competitor to the Lexus ES 350, but the LaCrosse beats that car in every driving category (quietness, sportiness, comfort) and is a serious value, including the desirable Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, AWD and adjustable firmness suspension that the ES lacks. The two latter options, however, are available only on higher trim levels, so be prepared to look at a $45,000 LaCrosse to get the optimal experience.\n\nAlso limited to the top trim is a precollision system with auto braking on the $41,990 Premium model, which is off-putting when competing vehicles include this safety feature for less money. The Acura TLX with Technology Package and precollision systems is $36,890, the Maxima SL has it for $37,875, and the Lexus ES 350 includes the feature standard for 2017 and runs $39,875.\n\nEven on less-expensive trims, however, the Buick LaCrosse is a delight to drive, hitting the bullseye for comfort and quietness — something a lot of premium cars seem to have forgotten how to do well.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2014 Buick LaCrosse is comfortable, spacious, quiet and well-crafted, but it’s saddled with a few annoying traits.\n\nThe LaCrosse is the largest sedan in Buick’s lineup and is related to GM’s other full-size cars: the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS. Changes to the LaCrosse for 2014 include updated exterior and interior styling, and new technology. To see the 2014 LaCrosse’s specs compared with the 2013 version, click here.\n\nThe redesign doesn’t change the cars that the Buick LaCrosse competes against, which include the Lexus ES 350, Toyota Avalon and Chrysler 300. To see how these cars’ specs compare with the LaCrosse’s, click here.\n\nThe 2014 Buick LaCrosse starts at $34,460 including a $925 destination charge. It comes standard with a mild-hybrid four-cylinder drivetrain; a V-6 engine is a no-charge option. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional for V-6 models. The car comes in base, Leather, Premium I and Premium II trim levels. We tested a well-equipped front-wheel-drive (FWD) Buick LaCrosse Premium I with the 304-horsepower V-6. The as-tested price was $45,595.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Buick LaCrosse’s blend of ride comfort and tightly controlled body motions is great. It doesn’t have the unwavering, planted feel that the Chrysler 300 exhibits, but you’re always firmly in control. The available adaptive suspension lets you feel bumps and other irregularities in the road, but the responses are very refined and appropriately luxurious.\n\nThis suspension offers Normal and Sport modes. The ride is firm but comfortable in Normal. The car rides a little harder and is less forgiving in Sport, but the differences are slight overall. Our test car wore 19-inch wheels, which is the smallest size offered with the adaptive suspension. If anything, larger wheels are likely to firm up the ride even more.\n\nSteering tuning is another highlight. The wheel turns with impressive smoothness, a light feel and welcome steering feedback. It’s well done.\n\nThe available 3.6-liter V-6 moves the nearly two-ton LaCrosse well enough. There’s adequate reserve power for passing at highway speeds, but don’t expect it to shove you back in your seat; the engine gets the job done without feeling underpowered, but nothing more. The V-6 is, however, incredibly silent; you barely hear it, even under full-throttle acceleration.\n\nThe V-6 works with a six-speed automatic transmission. One editor thought the automatic upshifted too soon and didn’t kick down quickly enough, but it never seemed like it was in the wrong gear during my testing. Like the V-6 engine, the transmission emphasizes smooth performance with barely felt shifts.\n\nThe mild-hybrid four-cylinder drivetrain is the gas-mileage leader, with an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined. The front-drive (FWD) V-6 is EPA-rated at 18/28/21 mpg. That trails the Chrysler 300 V-6 and Toyota Avalon, which have combined fuel economy of 23 and 25 mpg, respectively. With available all-wheel drive, the LaCrosse’s gas mileage estimates dip to 17/26/20 mpg.\n\nThe only part of the driving experience that stands out in a bad way is brake-pedal feel. It’s mushy, numb and doesn’t inspire confidence. The brakes have no trouble stopping the car, however.\n\nInterior\nMy strongest memory of the prior-generation Buick LaCrosse is the sore back I had after driving it. There are only a handful of cars I can say that about. As part of its 2014 redesign, the LaCrosse got new front seats and, Buick, my back thanks you; these are much more comfortable. I like to drive with the lumbar support, where adjustable, backed all the way off, and the standard four-way, power-adjustable lumbar support on the driver’s seat accommodates that preference.\n\nThe brown tones in our test car’s cabin — Buick calls the color scheme Choccachino with Cocoa accents — give the interior a rich look that’s different and attractive, but it contributes to significant and distracting windshield reflection. Polarized sunglasses cut the dashboard’s reflection in the glass appreciably, but if this kind of thing bothers you — and you want a better solution than constantly wearing sunglasses — consider the Ebony interior.\n\nRear visibility is another problem. It’s severely limited by the tall trunklid and accompanying slot-like rear window. This poor natural rear visibility makes the optional backup camera a must-have feature. The front roof pillars are thick, too; one editor momentarily lost track of a bicyclist behind one of them.\n\nThere’s ample backseat legroom for taller passengers (I’m 6-foot-1) but little headroom to spare. Rear seat cushioning and the seating position make life comfortable, but the view out the side window is restricted by the sleek roofline.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe dashboard controls have an all-new design centered around a standard 8-inch touch-screen. The new dashboard arrangement is a big usability improvement in all respects except one: the inclusion of touch-pad-style climate controls. The capacitive touch-pads look modern, with brushed-metallic surrounds, and are in easy reach, but we’ve never preferred them over regular buttons, and they’re maddening when wearing gloves.\n\nIt was very cold when I tested the Buick LaCrosse, with temperatures dipping into the single digits. I was constantly wearing gloves, and whenever I tried to adjust the cabin temperature or optional seat heaters, the touch-pads didn’t work. I had to remove my glove, make the adjustment, and then put it back on. It’s inexcusable. Please go back to physical buttons, Buick, like the ones between the touch-pads.\n\nThe head-up dashboard touch-screen runs the latest version of Buick’s IntelliLink entertainment system. The system’s menus are easy to use, and Buick is smart to include physical Back and Home buttons below the screen. The system connected easily to my iPhone via Bluetooth and it automatically downloaded my phonebook and call history. A USB port and MP3 jack provide additional ways to connect portable devices to the car.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe LaCrosse’s trunk measures 13.3 cubic feet with the V-6 engine and 10.8 cubic feet with the mild-hybrid four-cylinder. Both of these measurements are small considering the LaCrosse’s external bulk, but they’re also a bit deceiving. We were able to fit two sets of golf clubs and more than 10 grocery bags into the larger trunk at different times, and in both cases had plenty of room to spare. The standard split-folding rear backrest opens the cargo area to the passenger compartment when you need more room.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Buick LaCrosse hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as of this writing, but it received a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its performance in NHTSA tests.\n\nOptional safety features include rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning, a forward-collision warning system, a collision-mitigation system that can autonomously apply the brakes to reduce crash speed or avoid a crash entirely, and GM’s Safety Alert Seat. The Safety Alert Seat warns the driver of crash threats by vibrating sections of the seat.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how child-safety seats fit in the Buick LaCrosse, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhen you look at what you get for the Buick LaCrosse’s $34,460 starting price, it looks like a good value. There’s a lot of car here for the money, and the driving experience and overall cabin quality help the LaCrosse hold its own against luxury competitors. The midlevel Leather trim adds a number of popular features over the base sedan, including leather upholstery, heated front seats, a backup camera, passive entry, push-button start, a power front passenger seat, and rear parking sensors for around $2,000 more.\n\nEach generation of the Buick LaCrosse has brought steady improvements, and the 2014 update is no exception. With a few more changes, it could go from being a good car to a great one.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2014 about the 2014 Buick LaCrosse. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2014 Buick LaCrosse is comfortable, spacious, quiet and well-crafted, but it’s saddled with a few annoying traits.\n\nThe LaCrosse is the largest sedan in Buick’s lineup and is related to GM’s other full-size cars: the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS. Changes to the LaCrosse for 2014 include updated exterior and interior styling, and new technology. To see the 2014 LaCrosse’s specs compared with the 2013 version, click here.\n\nThe redesign doesn’t change the cars that the LaCrosse competes against, which include the Lexus ES 350, Toyota Avalon and Chrysler 300. To see how these cars’ specs compare with the LaCrosse’s, click here.\n\nThe 2014 LaCrosse starts at $34,460 including a $925 destination charge. It comes standard with a mild-hybrid four-cylinder drivetrain; a V-6 engine is a no-charge option. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional for V-6 models. The car comes in base, Leather, Premium I and Premium II trim levels. We tested a well-equipped front-wheel-drive LaCrosse Premium I with the 304-horsepower V-6. The as-tested price was $45,595.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe LaCrosse’s blend of ride comfort and tightly controlled body motions is great. It doesn’t have the unwavering, planted feel that the Chrysler 300 exhibits, but you’re always firmly in control. The available adaptive suspension lets you feel bumps and other irregularities in the road, but the responses are very refined and appropriately luxurious.\n\nThis suspension offers Normal and Sport modes. The ride is firm but comfortable in Normal. The car rides a little harder and is less forgiving in Sport, but the differences are slight overall. Our test car wore 19-inch wheels, which is the smallest size offered with the adaptive suspension. If anything, larger wheels are likely to firm up the ride even more.\n\nSteering tuning is another highlight. The wheel turns with impressive smoothness, a light feel and welcome steering feedback. It’s well done.\n\nThe available 3.6-liter V-6 moves the nearly two-ton LaCrosse well enough. There’s adequate reserve power for passing at highway speeds, but don’t expect it to shove you back in your seat; the engine gets the job done without feeling underpowered, but nothing more. The V-6 is, however, incredibly silent; you barely hear it, even under full-throttle acceleration.\n\nThe V-6 works with a six-speed automatic transmission. One editor thought the automatic upshifted too soon and didn’t kick down quickly enough, but it never seemed like it was in the wrong gear during my testing. Like the V-6 engine, the transmission emphasizes smooth performance with barely felt shifts.\n\nThe mild-hybrid four-cylinder drivetrain is the gas-mileage leader, with an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined. The front-wheel-drive V-6 is EPA-rated at 18/28/21 mpg. That trails the Chrysler 300 V-6 and Toyota Avalon, which have combined fuel economy of 23 and 25 mpg, respectively. With available all-wheel drive, the LaCrosse’s gas mileage estimates dip to 17/26/20 mpg.\n\nThe only part of the driving experience that stands out in a bad way is brake-pedal feel. It’s mushy, numb and doesn’t inspire confidence. The brakes have no trouble stopping the car, however.\n\nInterior\nMy strongest memory of the prior-generation LaCrosse is the sore back I had after driving it. There are only a handful of cars I can say that about. As part of its 2014 redesign, the LaCrosse got new front seats and, Buick, my back thanks you; these are much more comfortable. I like to drive with the lumbar support, where adjustable, backed all the way off, and the standard four-way, power-adjustable lumbar support on the driver’s seat accommodates that preference.\n\nThe brown tones in our test car’s cabin — Buick calls the color scheme Choccachino with Cocoa accents — give the interior a rich look that’s different and attractive, but it contributes to significant and distracting windshield reflection. Polarized sunglasses cut the dashboard’s reflection in the glass appreciably, but if this kind of thing bothers you — and you want a better solution than constantly wearing sunglasses — consider the Ebony interior.\n\nRear visibility is another problem. It’s severely limited by the tall trunklid and accompanying slot-like rear window. This poor natural rear visibility makes the optional backup camera a must-have feature. The front roof pillars are thick, too; one editor momentarily lost track of a bicyclist behind one of them.\n\nThere’s ample backseat legroom for taller passengers (I’m 6-foot-1) but little headroom to spare. Backseat cushioning and the seating position make life comfortable, but the view out the side window is restricted by the sleek roofline.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe dashboard controls have an all-new design centered around a standard 8-inch touch-screen. The new dashboard arrangement is a big usability improvement in all respects except one: the inclusion of touch-pad-style climate controls. The capacitive touch-pads look modern, with brushed-metallic surrounds, and are in easy reach, but we’ve never preferred them over regular buttons, and they’re maddening when wearing gloves.\n\nIt was very cold when I tested the LaCrosse, with temperatures dipping into the single digits. I was constantly wearing gloves, and whenever I tried to adjust the cabin temperature or optional seat heaters, the touch-pads didn’t work. I had to remove my glove, make the adjustment, and then put it back on. It’s inexcusable. Please go back to physical buttons, Buick, like the ones between the touch-pads.\n\nThe dashboard touch-screen runs the latest version of Buick’s IntelliLink entertainment system. The system’s menus are easy to use, and Buick is smart to include physical Back and Home buttons below the screen. The system connected easily to my iPhone via Bluetooth and it automatically downloaded my phonebook and call history. A USB port and MP3 jack provide additional ways to connect portable devices to the car.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe LaCrosse’s trunk measures 13.3 cubic feet with the V-6 engine and 10.8 cubic feet with the mild-hybrid four-cylinder. Both of these measurements are small considering the LaCrosse’s external bulk, but they’re also a bit deceiving. We were able to fit two sets of golf clubs and more than 10 grocery bags into the larger trunk at different times, and in both cases had plenty of room to spare. The standard split-folding rear backrest opens the cargo area to the passenger compartment when you need more room.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 LaCrosse hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as of this writing, but it received a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its performance in NHTSA tests.\n\nOptional safety features include rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert, a backup camera, a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning, a forward-collision warning system, a collision-mitigation system that can autonomously apply the brakes to reduce crash speed or avoid a crash entirely, and GM’s Safety Alert Seat. The Safety Alert Seat warns the driver of crash threats by vibrating sections of the seat.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how child-safety seats fit in the LaCrosse, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhen you look at what you get for the LaCrosse’s $34,460 starting price, it looks like a good value. There’s a lot of car here for the money, and the driving experience and overall cabin quality help the LaCrosse hold its own against luxury competitors. The midlevel Leather trim adds a number of popular features over the base sedan, including leather upholstery, heated front seats, a backup camera, passive entry, push-button start, a power front passenger seat, and rear parking sensors for around $2,000 more.\n\nEach generation of the LaCrosse has brought steady improvements, and the 2014 update is no exception. With a few more changes, it could go from being a good car to a great one.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "GM’s old mild hybrids, such as the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, delivered all the flashy hybrid badges without the big fuel-economy gains. This time around, things are different.\n\nThe 2013 Buick LaCrosse eAssist offers a comfortable ride and an inviting interior with unobtrusive fuel-saving technology.\n\nAs in 2012, the 2013 Buick LaCrosse comes with a standard electric-motor-assisted eAssist four-cylinder engine or an optional V-6 engine; I tested the eAssist. The only major change this year is that Buick’s IntelliLink multimedia system is now standard. Compare the 2012 and 2013 versions here.\n\nBuick’s largest sedan competes in the near-luxury body-type segment, a limited field that includes the mainstream  Volkswagen Passat and the upscale Lexus ES 300h. The Passat comes in five- and six-cylinder gas and four-cylinder diesel trims; the ES 300h is a four-cylinder hybrid. Compare all three sedans here.\n\neAssist: Refined, Smooth, Efficient\nThe LaCrosse’s most impressive detail is easy to miss: Its mild-hybrid powertrain is so seamless, you barely sense it working. The system conserves fuel with a combination of regenerative braking, electric assist during acceleration and a stop-start function.\n\nIt’s all to good effect: The car is both surprisingly potent and efficient. It felt stronger than expected, especially in a car that weighs close to 4,000 pounds. The powertrain moved the LaCrosse without a problem and never felt lacking, thanks to an assist from a lithium-ion battery pack and a 15-kilowatt electric motor. The motor combines with the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine for 182 horsepower total. The LaCrosse eAssist is EPA rated at 25/36 mpg city/highway, compared with the two-wheel-drive V-6’s 17/27 mpg (all-wheel drive is a V-6-only option, rated 17/25 mpg).\n\nThe Lexus ES 300h, however, delivers 40/39 mpg from its hybrid system, which combines an electric motor with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder for a total of 200 hp. Also more impressive is the Volkswagen Passat TDI’s 31/43 mpg rating, compliments of its satisfying 2.0-liter diesel four-cylinder. Though it only makes 140 hp, 236 pounds-feet of torque at 1,750 rpm make it lively from a stop and strong on the highway.\n\nPower delivery in the LaCrosse is smooth, and shifts around town are well-timed, but the six-speed automatic’s downshifts seem a bit delayed on the highway. At cruising speeds, the LaCrosse has impressive road isolation, making for a pillowy ride and a hushed interior. You pay for the compliant ride in the handling department, however; it’s by no means an agile car. The sedan’s full heft is felt hustling through corners.\n\nThe Buick LaCrosse earns another point in the refinement column for its automatic stop/start engine. In fact, it’s smoother than many similar Mercedes-Benz and BMW systems, which can sound harsher and feel more abrupt. The LaCrosse’s transitions were barely perceptible by comparison.\n\nThe regenerative braking system will give drivers pause, however. The brakes have a non-linear action and a stiff, brick-like feel. The response is mushy initially, then lurchy toward the end of the stop; it makes for an overall unnatural sensation.\n\nIn the Lap of Luxury\nThe Buick LaCrosse may compete in the near-luxury class, but there’s nothing just “near” about the luxury of its interior. The top-of-the-line cabin is richly appointed with wood and chrome trim, and the seats are supportive and cushy. It has the high-class look and feel of a more expensive vehicle, all the way up to the Touring trim level, with the attention to detail you’d expect from a Lexus.\n\nMy test car had leather seats and surfaces and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, which are standard on all but the Buick LaCrosse base model, and the materials felt rich — even the padded plastic. Blue ambient lighting and contrast-color stitching tie the cabin’s design together.\n\nThe newly standard IntelliLink multimedia system is refreshingly intuitive, and its large touch-screen buttons have a quick response time. If that’s not your style, you can use the center dial and traditional push-buttons instead. Setting the radio presets was a no-brainer, as was pairing and connecting my phone with Bluetooth and launching the Pandora internet radio app. Navigation is an $895 option available on all but the base model; it’s a $2,625 option on the ES 300h and an extra $1,660 on base Passat TDIs. It’s standard on the uplevel version of the Passat TDI.\n\nThe Buick LaCrosse Premium’s curved, twin-cockpit setup makes the cabin look and feel expansive, and I had plenty of head- and legroom in front. Although the LaCrosse is the longest sedan of the three, it offers slightly less front headroom than the VW. The Buick is roomier than both in back, however, with 40.5 inches of legroom, compared with the Passat’s 39.1 inches and the ES 300h’s 40 inches.\n\nLow-cut door openings mean taller passengers will have to stoop to get in the back. Once there, the second row is roomy enough for two adults, but the middle seat is kid-only territory. The front cabin’s center console eats up knee space, and a high floor hump steals foot space. Add a stiff cushion and you have the least comfortable seat in the house.\n\nThe LaCrosse’s trunk space also disappoints. Sixty percent of the backseat folds, but the opening is only a narrow pass-through. The battery blocks most of it, eating up a decent part of the trunk’s cargo space. EAssist versions have just 10.9 cubic feet of trunk space (2.4 cubic feet less than V-6 models), which trails the ES 300h’s 12.1 and the Passat’s 15.9 cubic feet. Interior storage is also lacking: The center console is smaller than you’d expect in a sedan this size, and the tiny door pockets are practically useless.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Buick LaCrosse an overall score of five stars. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the LaCrosse has received the agency’s highest rating, Good, in all areas of testing thus far. (The new small overlap front test has not yet been conducted.)\n\nGM’s OnStar safety communication system is standard with six months of free service, as are six airbags: front and side-impact airbags for the front seats and two side curtain airbags that cover both rows. Seat-mounted rear side airbags are a $350 option across the lineup. Other available safety features include a blind spot warning system and adaptive auto-dimming cornering headlights that automatically swivel to illuminate upcoming curves when you turn the steering wheel.\n\nVisibility forward and back is partially obscured due to the sedan’s sloping roofline and its high belt line (with resulting short windows). The LaCrosse’s side mirrors are also a bit small. The reverse-sensing system with backup camera helps, and it’s standard on all but the base model. A camera is standard only on higher Passat trim levels, and it’s a $740 option on the ES 300h. Click here for a full list of safety features and here for our Car Seat Check.\n\nFeatures & Price\nThe 2013 Buick LaCrosse starts at $32,555 (all prices include destination charges) and is available in base, Leather, Premium 1 and Premium 2 trims; the eAssist powertrain can be had only on base and Leather trims. My Leather trim test car started at $34,765 and was well-equipped with standards like heated leather seats, the IntelliLink multimedia system, keyless entry, remote start, a backup camera with park assist and power front seats with lumbar adjustment and memory.\n\nThe LaCrosse splits the difference between the Volkswagen Passat TDI ($27,020) and Lexus ES 300h ($39,745). Leather seats on an ES 300h will cost an extra $1,370, and it will take another $440 to get them heated. Heated leather seats are standard on uplevel versions of the Passat.\n\nThe value leader is clearly the Passat, but diesel power doesn’t appeal to everyone. The fuel-economy champ is the ES 300h, but its higher sticker and lack of standard equipment mean prices can quickly escalate. Again, the LaCrosse splits the difference, carving out a niche as a comfortable, efficient and relatively affordable sedan.\n\nIn the Market\nI keep coming back to the word “pleasant” to describe the LaCrosse. That may sound boring, but here it’s not. Pleasant is what this brand strives for and what Buick’s customers want — both its traditional, comfort-seeking consumers and a new set of shoppers looking for a stylish, comfortable and fuel-efficient sedan. The LaCrosse eAssist delivers in all three areas.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "As a member of Generation X, I’ve never been ready to admit that a midsize sedan would work well for my family, but after spending significant time with the Buick LaCrosse, I just couldn’t deny it anymore.\n\nThe 2012 Buick LaCrosse’s smooth ride transported me in total comfort, and it was so well-equipped with many of my favorite tech and luxury features that I enjoyed driving it much more than I expected.\n\nThe LaCrosse delivers a pleasurable ride, but it does feel a little slow at times, both in acceleration and braking. With such a cushy ride, there’s no need to hurry anyway, but I would’ve preferred a little more power and responsiveness.\n\nBuick’s eAssist technology, which comes standard on the LaCrosse with the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, was designed to increase fuel economy by using a small electric motor to help the gasoline engine. Also, when the car is idle, the engine switches off, and once the driver pushes the gas pedal again, it switches back on. I found the eAssist system to be smooth, and the engine’s stop/start technology was almost unnoticeable when driving unlike when I tested a similar feature in the BMW 5 Series sedan.\n\nThe 2012 LaCrosse base model has a starting price of $31,045, but my test car, a Premium I trim, came in at $36,175.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 LaCrosse is a classy sedan. Sure, you might think that would age it, but it’s quite the opposite. It’s got a sleek, sculpted look, and with lots of shiny chrome accents, the LaCrosse is well-suited to stand up against other luxury sedans in the looks department. At first glance, I thought it looked rather large, but once I drove it, it didn’t feel as big as it looked from the outside.\n\nEase of entry and exit is almost a non-issue in the LaCrosse. The rear roofline has a drastic slope, so I had to be cautious when loading my daughter into her child-safety seat. You’ll have to help smaller children open and close the heavy doors, but overall, there should be no major problems caused by the LaCrosse’s exterior styling. It’s easy to access the cargo area — one push of the button on the key fob and the trunk pops right open.\n\nThe trunk’s size is compromised because the eAssist system’s lithium-ion battery is stored there, so be warned that larger strollers are a tight fit. If you’re headed to the grocery store or are taking a quick jaunt with an umbrella stroller in tow, it’ll be just fine.\n\nThe 2012 LaCrosse comes standard with a 182-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection that’s paired to a 15-kilowatt electric motor. EPA estimates for the LaCrosse are 25/36 mpg city/highway. The eAssist system had a positive impact on my gas mileage during my test drive, especially in the city, and using regular unleaded gasoline made for more budget-friendly times at the pump, as well. A 303-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is optional; it gets 17/27 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe LaCrosse’s interior is luxurious and comes off as upscale. Each time a new passenger saddled into this five-seater they immediately exclaimed how gorgeous things were inside. It was true, and I wholeheartedly agreed each time that praise was awarded.\n\nThe sedan’s displays and graphics are some of the best I’ve seen inside a car to date, and the Ice Blue backlit gauges and accent lighting won me over. The amount of tech in this car will satisfy the savviest of techie moms and dads, especially with its large 8-inch touch-screen and head-up display feature, which really makes things feel futuristic.\n\nBuick’s IntelliLink multimedia system is intuitive and simple to use. The icons make navigating through your music library or even making adjustments to climate controls a piece of cake. Despite the similarities, the IntelliLink system is far superior to (and much less frustrating than) MyFord Touch. One huge surprise, especially with a sticker price of $36K, was the lack of a navigation system and map display. You are provided personalized turn-by-turn directions in the vehicle via OnStar, but I really missed my map, which is an $895 option. This seemed to be a glaring omission, especially at my test car’s Premium trim level.\n\nThe biggest luxuries found in the LaCrosse are the comfortable seats, ample legroom and general roominess in the cabin. There’s lots of space to be comfortable in this five-seater, though with child-safety seats installed in the backseat, you’ll be better off with just four. The LaCrosse can fit another couple in the backseat on double-date night just as easily as it can accommodate space-hogging rear-facing safety seats. My husband had room to stretch in front as well, even with our daughter’s rear-facing safety seat behind him.\n\nOne odd thing about the LaCrosse was that despite its roomy interior, it was skimpy on storage space. Everybody gets a cupholder, but the center console is teeny and the door cutouts are so small that they’re useless.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe LaCrosse received an overall safety score of five stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received five stars in front and side crash tests and four stars in rollover crash tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also named the LaCrosse a Top Safety Pick. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\n\nThe LaCrosse has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, a six-month OnStar subscription, rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional features are all-wheel drive, head-up display, a backup camera, a blind spot warning system, rear side-impact airbags and adaptive, auto-leveling headlights.\n\nThe LaCrosse has the standard two sets of Latch anchors in the outboard seat, but there’s also one additional anchor in the middle seat position. That extra Latch anchor makes it possible to properly install a child-safety seat in the middle of the second row. However, the stiff seat cushions made it somewhat difficult to use the Latch anchors. Once I got the cushions pushed back far enough, installation went quickly. See how the LaCrosse fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Buick LaCrosse here.",
