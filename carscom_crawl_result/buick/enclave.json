      "expert_review": "The verdict: The most opulent of GM’s big three-row SUV trio, the redesigned 2025 Buick Enclave’s luxury trimmings are let down by an uncharacteristically loud cabin and coarse engine.\n\nVersus the competition: The Enclave is nicer inside than luxury-brand competitors like the Lexus TX or Acura MDX, but not when you put your foot down.\n\nThe third installment of GM’s big three-row crossover-style SUVs has finally been redesigned and let loose on the public: the 2025 Buick Enclave. It’s ostensibly the nicest, most opulent of the three (the others being the Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia), and it has styling inspired by the Buick Wildcat EV show car. It sits atop the pantheon of SUVs that now comprise the entire American Buick lineup (Buick still sells actual cars in China for now, at least) and is the biggest, nicest GM SUV you can buy that isn’t a Cadillac. But how nice is it? Is there a big difference from the Chevy and GMC versions given they share a lot of bits under the sheet metal? We flew to Portland, Ore., to drive the new 2025 Enclave from the town to the coast and back, and came away with some thoughts on the most luxurious version of GM’s big SUVs. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2025 Buick Enclave Completes Brand’s Showroom Refresh\n\nThe Carlike One\n\nOf all the variants that use this big SUV platform, the Enclave looks the most carlike. Whereas the Traverse and Acadia are meant to be capable off-road with specific off-road trim levels, the Buick takes a different path. It’s the on-road-only, opulent, luxurious one, and the styling reflects that. The Chevy and GMC are blocky, chunky and rugged-looking, while the Buick flows, full of smooth lines and slim lighting elements. It definitely fits in with the rest of the Buick lineup and appears smaller and sleeker than its siblings despite being longer, wider and taller than its predecessor.\n\nThere are three trim levels to choose from: the base Preferred, which still comes very well equipped (which it had better, given its starting price), the sportier-looking Sport Touring (or ST) and the most luxurious Avenir. It’s meant to compete against higher trim levels of the Hyundai Palisade and Ford Explorer, as well as premium brand offerings like the Acura MDX, Lexus TX, Lincoln Aviator and Infiniti QX60. The Preferred has black plastic moldings and standard 20-inch wheels. The ST blacks out all the chrome, has a larger meshlike grille and wears different standard 20-inch wheels. The Avenir brings all the chrome back, bumps the standard wheel size up to 22 inches and gets body-color trim. There isn’t much obvious exterior differentiation between the trim levels, but the overall look is clean, modern and fairly distinctive.\n\nThe Opulent Interior\n\nThe biggest difference from the Chevy and GMC (and, honestly, from the competition) is the Enclave’s most excellent interior. The Chevy is nice, and the GMC is impressive in terms of quality and design, but the Buick (especially in top Avenir trim) truly impresses. Preferred variants get a choice of a black or black-and-tan interior (that one really pops), while the ST comes only with a rather somber black-with-white-piping look. But the Avenir’s two light-colored interiors (black is the third choice) are what delivers the knockout punch, especially the blue-and-light-tan version that immediately sets it apart from more mundane competitor interiors.\n\nA slick 30-inch curved combination touchscreen and digital instrument panel spans the dash, and it’s a seamless display from edge to edge. Unlike the controls in the Chevy and GMC, however, Buick has put nearly everything in the touchscreen, including some (but not all) of the climate controls, so we’re docking points for this setup versus the excellent 15-inch vertically oriented screen in the Acadia, in particular. But the Enclave’s materials quality is just as good as the Acadia’s and easily as good or better than most of its competitors, including (perhaps most surprisingly) the TX. Materials quality is excellent, the designs are fresh and modern, and the upholstery feels expensive.\n\nThe only issue is that half the digital display is obscured by the steering wheel — the Enclave needs a “squircle” wheel like the ones in the Lincoln Nautilus, Kia EV9 and Chevrolet Corvette. The more amorphously shaped the information display, the better a squared-off-style wheel is for allowing you to see more of it. The Enclave’s round steering wheel is thick and feels good, but it blocks your view of the screen.\n\nFoot-Down Letdown\n\nPowering the ‘25 Enclave is the exact same turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that you’ll find under the hood of the lesser Traverse and Acadia. And I mean the exact same; it puts out the same power — 328 horsepower and 326 pounds-feet of torque — and pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the front or all four wheels.\n\nThe powertrain is the weakest link in the Enclave’s otherwise very lovely driving experience — it’s just as loud and coarse in the Enclave as it is in the Traverse, and while this can be forgiven in the less expensive Chevy, it’s inexcusable in the much more expensive Buick. Like in its sibling SUVs, the engine doesn’t feel like it’s delivering nearly as much power as the company says it is.\n\nDriving the Enclave made me wonder where the whole “Quiet Tuning” ethos of Buick went, because quiet the Enclave is not. Engine noise is prominent, and it’s not a pleasant exhaust note you’re hearing. Road noise is considerable — far more than should be coming through in a Buick that’s had a bunch of specific sound isolation measures added plus active noise cancellation through the Bose audio system. I had to raise my voice significantly to talk to a front-seat passenger when traveling on asphalt highways at just 50 mph.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nRide quality is the best thing about the Enclave — either with the conventional suspension of the ST trim or the computer-controlled electronic shocks in the Avenir. But frankly, I couldn’t tell the two trim levels’ ride and handling qualities apart, and the same ride-quality praise applies to the Traverse and Acadia, as well.\n\nThere’s simply nothing more luxurious, isolating, coddling or calming about the Enclave’s driving experience versus that of the Acadia or Traverse. They’re all loud inside, they all handle beautifully, and they all have ride quality that is truly best in class. The differentiation between the brands comes in the designs, shapes, styles and materials choices (but not necessarily materials quality) — an Acadia Denali with its real wood trim and rich color palette is easily as nice as an Enclave Avenir, but it’s styled to be more industrial chic and less flowy-shaped luxury wagon. The lack of any experiential differentiation beyond that is actually rather disappointing and leads to the question of value at the high end of the price range.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2025 Buick Enclave: A Little Bigger, a Little More Expensive\n2025 Buick Enclave Up Close: Nicer Than You Remember\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\n2024 GMC Acadia Review: Distinctive Looks, Common Personality\nShop for a 2025 Buick Enclave\nAt What Price?\n\nThe new ‘25 Enclave is not cheap — the Preferred trim starts at $46,395 (all prices include destination fee), the ST starts at $48,795 and the Avenir jumps up to $59,395. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option across the board. Load up an Avenir and you can pass $66,000, which is certainly near-luxury pricing. That high pricing puts it up against the Lexus TX, Mazda CX-90, Acura MDX and, of course, the GMC Acadia Denali.\n\nThe new Enclave is indeed a premium product, but it’s not as premium as it should be at this price, let down as it is by its low-rent powertrain and surprisingly noisy cabin. It feels expensive, looks expensive and is expensive at its upper reaches, but Buick needs to keep working at powertrain differentiation in order for it to drive expensive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Crossover utility vehicles are essentially the minivans of the new millennium. If you need to haul seven or eight people, a crossover is certainly more stylish than most minivans.\n\nFrom a fuel economy perspective, a crossover is way more economical than a truck-based SUV.\n\nGM’s new family of crossovers includes the Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia, and they all share the same basic platform. The Enclave has the boldest styling.\n\nThe Enclave combines luxury, handling and performance in a way that puts it on even footing with the best-selling vehicles in the segment. The handsome exterior bulges in all the right places, and the wheels sit out nearly flush with the body sides. The cabin’s greenhouse, or window area, is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, adding to a muscular, well-planted stance. Inside, there is room for seven or eight, depending on the configuration.\n\nThe Enclave comes in front-wheel or all-wheel drive in two trim levels. Base prices start at $32,790 for a front-wheel-drive CX and range to $36,990 for an all-wheel-drive CXL.\n\nThe test vehicle, a front-wheel-drive CX, had a sticker price of $37,045.\n\nThe Enclave is firm and confident on twisting two-lane roads. The body stays admirably flat in turns, and the ride is both comfortable and responsive. A compact independent rear suspension plays a big role in the vehicle’s overall handling prowess, but some credit also goes to the Michelin tires that were designed specifically for the Enclave to provide good grip without sacrificing ride quality or noise. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard and 19s are optional.\n\nQuiet vehicles intrinsically feel luxurious, and Buick engineers have paid a great deal of attention to noise reduction throughout the Enclave. The windshield utilizes glass with a sound-deadening laminate, and portions of the body have laminated steel panels. Expandable foam fills many body cavities to absorb noise. It’s easy to talk inside the vehicle at 70 miles per hour, even from the third row.\n\nThe Enclave’s interior is both warm and welcoming. The level of materials and surfaces is on par with other vehicles in this price segment. The wood-grain trim on the test vehicle was an obvious imitation.\n\nThe front seats have excellent lateral and lumbar support. The optional second-row captain’s seats are not only pleasant to sit in, but they also tip and slide forward to ease access to the third seat. The third seat is not just a penalty box for children, but a seat that is actually usable by adults.\n\nThe Enclave’s 3.6-liter V-6 is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. This transversely mounted powerplant, also used in the Outlook and Acadia, has dual overhead cams, four valves per cylinder and variable valve timing. Horsepower is 275. Fuel economy, rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway, is a bit of an issue given the current price of gasoline.\n\nFor 2009, Buick will offer a direct-injection version of this engine for slightly more power and better efficiency.\n\nOut on the road, this engine is smooth and relatively quiet. Mash the throttle and it responds with good power. I found that cruising through hilly terrain with three persons aboard caused the engine to shift up and down frequently to maintain a consistent speed. More midrange torque would give the Enclave even stronger performance in these situations.\n\nPrice The base price of the test vehicle was $32,790. Options included a Bose stereo and a rear-seat DVD player, machined wheels and special paint. The sticker price was $37,045.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles, with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "The oh-so-beautiful 2009 Buick Enclave has inspired me to create a new television series, “Extreme Makeover: Car Edition.” I’d love for some hunky host to relay my automotive sob-story to the masses, followed by the ultimate pulverization of my eight-year-old, 150,000-mile “piece.” At the end of the show, the bright, shiny Enclave would sit in my garage! Unlike my test car, it’d have all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Enclave exuded class, inside and out. It was adorned with lots of chrome jewelry to put that extra twinkle in the eyes of all the pedestrians as you drove by. On the inside, there were heated seats for the driver and front passenger, and zoned heating and cooling for all three rows.\n\nIts ride felt good. While I was test-driving the Enclave, Michigan was smacked with a few inches of fresh snow on top of the already-compacted snow, which made driving conditions less than desirable. While I really wish I’d had an all-wheel-drive model, the FWD responded well in the snow, and the electronic stability system with traction control kicked in on just about every trip to and from my son’s school. This extra hand made me feel confident that, even without AWD, the car was doing a great job of keeping us safe.\n\nThe Enclave was downright powerful despite its ample size and could quickly pick up speed from a dead stop. Its braking was equally impressive, especially considering the snowy roads. We never skidded into a stop. Inside the roomy cabin, the ride was quiet, which is something Buicks have become known for. I always appreciate a higher vantage point, and the Enclave’s highly maneuverable driver’s seat allowed me to gain a few inches in height that God chose to leave out.\n\nThe only negative I discovered about the Enclave was its less-than-fabulous gas mileage. The Enclave gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway. I averaged 16.7 mpg combined on my country roads. Perhaps there could be a hybrid in the Enclave’s future?\n\nExterior\n\nBuick designers added several exterior features to keep this ride from becoming homogenized. Sporty headlights set off its glorious chrome grille, which is embellished with a sandwich-sized Buick emblem.\n\nSassy hood vents are nestled atop the front end, giving the Enclave a touch of speedster sex appeal. Nineteen-inch chromed aluminum wheels were added to the model I drove, which is like adding some serious jewelry to your car. It gave the Enclave miles and miles o’ shine. Gotta love the shine!\n\nThe second- and third-row windows are tinted for extra privacy. Fully integrated rocker panels protect passengers big and small from the dirt that comes with climbing in and out of SUVs or large crossovers. Optional exterior steps are available and would certainly be added to my customized Enclave wish list.\n\nIn the rear, the chrome-encircled taillights really pop. The Enclave also has my favorite exterior feature – a push-button power liftgate! I cannot tell you how much I love this. Simply push the button on the key fob and the gate opens. To close it, push another button on the door itself. There’s no grunting, reaching or “umph!”-ing to get the gate closed. Yay!\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe Enclave’s interior is luxurious, pretty-looking and within reach. I say within reach because the Enclave is a really big crossover. Normally when I get into a big crossover I can’t reach all the controls, but in the Enclave I was able to both reach items on the center stack and hand gum to my kids in the backseat (while stopped at a red light, naturally). I still don’t know how the latter was possible, because the second-row captain’s chairs seemed so far away from me that I often thought the kids weren’t even in the car at all. Can you imagine the peace?\n\nFrom the driver’s standpoint, all instrumentation was simple and easy to read. Even the electronic systems that told you how much gas you were using and when your next oil change should be were easy to use with the push of a button. I appreciated the little things, like the adorable clock placed in the center of the dash, the armrest that could move fore and aft to accommodate people of different sizes, and the super-sized lumbar support that helped me feel comfortable at all times.\n\nIn the second row, captain’s chairs kept the kids from knocking each other around and provided enough room to easily access the third row. The boys’ booster seats fit nicely into the seats, and my oldest was able to buckle in easily – lemme hear an hallelujah! Seatback pockets gave the kids plenty of storage, and cupholders in the doors kept drinks well within reach. One option I’d liked to have tried was the center console for the second row. My test car wasn’t equipped with it. In photos, it appears to house cupholders, some storage space and more of the shiny faux-wood accents the front-row passengers enjoy.\n\nThe third row was roomier than most I’ve seen, and it also offered cupholders for the outboard passengers. I loved that the seat belt for the third-row center seat was retractable and easily housed in the ceiling when not in use. It showed that Buick’s design team was really thinking when it worked on this crossover, not just throwing in features to suit a corporate checklist.\n\nI tested the Enclave’s cargo space with a trip to the grocery store. With the quick tug of a belt, the third row folded down easily and really opened up the cargo area. It was so huge I could have easily stretched out back there. After emptying all the groceries out of the back, a quick pull on the strap had the row upright again. All that was left for me to do was press the button to close the hatch. Gotta love features that really do make your life easier!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nLike many of the homes created on “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,” the Buick Enclave has all the important features. It scored a Good, the highest score, in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It also nabbed a 2009 Top Safety Pick award from IIHS. To earn this honor, a car must score Good in its crash tests and have electronic stability control.\n\nThe Enclave’s safety features also include antilock brakes; traction control; front and side-impact airbags; side curtain airbags for the first, second and third rows; a Latch system; and a year’s subscription to OnStar with Turn-by-Turn Navigation. Add the optional AWD to this list, and you’ll be all set, even if you live in Michigan!\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The Enclave is great for toting babies and all their gear.\n\nIn School: Children in booster seats will love the captain’s chairs.\n\nTeens: Once they get in, they’re sure to enjoy all the amenities",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2010 about the 2010 Buick Enclave. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA lot of car shoppers link minivans with a terminal case of parental frumpiness, but when it comes to outright utility those vehicles have long beaten more socially acceptable crossovers, hands down. General Motors’ three-row crossovers — the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave — narrow that divide.\n\nThe Enclave combines outstanding utility with premium touches not usually found in such a roomy vehicle.\n\nIntroduced for 2008, the three-row Enclave (most expensive of the three GMs) seats up to eight. All-wheel drive is optional, and trim levels include the CX, CXL-1 and CXL-2. We tested a front-wheel-drive, seven-seat Enclave CXL-2. Click here to compare the 2010 Enclave with the 2009, or here to compare it with its Chevrolet and GMC cohorts.\n\nCapable, Comfortable\nIn its first year on the market, the Enclave’s standard 3.6-liter V-6 felt so burdened by the crossover’s plus-sized weight — it comes in at nearly 5,000 pounds, much more than most minivans — it had a hard time generating good passing power. That’s not the case anymore. Aided by direct-injection technology, today’s Enclave has surprising pep. It moves out from stoplights and makes quick work of uphill on-ramps; the standard six-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and kicks down without too much delay.\n\nWith seven adults in our front-drive test vehicle, getting up to highway speeds took about all the power the Enclave could muster — but the V-6 was up to the task. All-wheel drive adds another 200 pounds, but short of a full passenger load, that extra weight shouldn’t bother the Enclave.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal feels mushy, and even modest stops induce plenty of forward suspension dive. The Enclave’s EPA gas mileage, at 17/24 mpg city/highway, nearly matches most mom-mobiles, and it’s competitive with other large crossovers. All-wheel drive knocks mileage down to 16/22 mpg. The Enclave also runs fine on regular gas; several luxury competitors recommend or require premium.\n\nThough all crossovers employ carlike independent suspensions, that doesn’t always guarantee ride comfort. Buick has done a nice job here. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, but even with my tester’s optional 20-inch wheels and P255/50R20 tires, the Enclave absorbs bumps and masks highway imperfections well. What’s more, it doesn’t come off feeling floaty and uncontrolled, which is a downside of many soft-riding SUVs, in the process.\n\nAt low speeds, the steering wheel turns with light effort and buttery smoothness. The Enclave has numb reflexes and plenty of body roll, but it points where you want easily enough. At highway speeds, the wheel has appropriately low assist and requires few corrections to stay on course.\n\nRoomy, For a Crossover\nWith convincing faux aluminum trim, upholstered window pillars and plenty of low-gloss, padded surfaces, the Enclave’s cabin feels richer than any well-optioned minivan’s — not to mention its GM siblings. Roomy front seats, a high driving position and an easy-access third row, on the other hand, create a similar feeling: “It’s like a minivan in here,” one backseat passenger said.\n\nWell, almost. The Enclave’s seven seats — eight, if you swap the second-row captain’s chairs for a three-seat bench — and 153 cubic feet of passenger space beat other crossovers but fall short of a Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. That becomes apparent in the second row, where adults will find ample legroom but not enough thigh support. The captain’s chairs sit too low to the ground, and their narrow seatbacks could have larger passengers insisting on sitting up front.\n\nProvided those in the adjustable second-row seats can scoot forward a few clicks, third-row passengers should have enough legroom. The bench seat sits very close to the floor, but so do most third rows.\n\nBehind the third row is 23.2 cubic feet of cargo room, which ranks at the top of the crossover class. Fold all the seats down, and the Enclave’s 115.3 cubic feet of cargo volume is similarly impressive. See how it stacks up against a few competitors — as well as a minivan:\n\nCargo Room Compared\n \t2010 Acura MDX\t2010 Volvo XC90\t2010 Buick Enclave\t2011 Toyota Sienna\nBase price\t$42,230\t$37,700\t$35,515\t$24,260\nOverall length (in.)\t191.6\t189.3\t201.5\t200.2\nMaximum seats\t7\t7\t8\t8\nCargo behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\t15.0\t8.8\t23.2\t39.1\nCargo behind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\t42.9\t43.3\t67.5\t87.1\nCargo behind 1st row (cu. ft.)\t83.5\t85.1\t115.3\t150.0\nSource: Automakers\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nIn front, side and rear-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Enclave scored the top rating, Good. IIHS has yet to perform its new roof-strength tests on the SUV. Standard safety features include front, side-impact and three-row curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard; click here to view a full list.\n\nIn nearly three years on the market, the Enclave’s reliability has been average — better than the Acadia but worse than the Traverse. The MDX and Lexus RX fare better; the XC90 and Audi Q7 fare worse.\n\nAt $35,515, the front-wheel-drive Enclave CX has family-friendly features like a power liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate control in front with manual rear controls, power front seats, and a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack and steering-wheel audio controls. The leather-upholstered CXL-1 runs $38,630, while the top-of-the-line CXL-2 runs $41,995. On any trim, all-wheel drive adds $2,000. Available features on higher trims include heated and cooled seats, a moonroof with a fixed second-row skylight, a navigation system, rear parking sensors and a backup camera.\n\nLoad the Enclave up, and an all-wheel-drive CXL-2 tops out at just over $50,000.\n\nEnclave in the Market\nThough today’s minivans have enough options to spiral beyond $40,000, the market never really saw the need for a dedicated luxury model. Instead we have a collection of luxury crossovers and SUVs, many of which give up a big chunk of utility in the name of styling, performance or plain old opulence. The Enclave provides a compelling response to that: For a reasonable price, it combines near-minivan utility with entry-luxury quality. That’s a rare combination.\n\nDo car shoppers want something like this? I’d say so. Enclave sales are up more than 30 percent in 2010, making it one of GM’s rising stars. Some areas — namely styling and cabin design — will impress less as fresh competition arrives over the next few years, but I suspect the Enclave’s inherent qualities will be harder to beat.\n\n \n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "A lot of car shoppers link minivans with a terminal case of parental frumpiness, but when it comes to outright utility those vehicles have long beaten more socially acceptable crossovers, hands down. General Motors’ three-row crossovers — the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave — narrow that divide.\n\nThe Enclave combines outstanding utility with premium touches not usually found in such a roomy vehicle.\n\nIntroduced for 2008, the three-row Enclave (most expensive of the three GMs) seats up to eight. All-wheel drive is optional, and trim levels include the CX, CXL-1 and CXL-2. We tested a front-wheel-drive, seven-seat Enclave CXL-2. Click here to compare the 2010 Enclave with the 2009, or here to compare it with its Chevrolet and GMC cohorts.\n\nCapable, Comfortable\nIn its first year on the market, the Enclave’s standard 3.6-liter V-6 felt so burdened by the crossover’s plus-sized weight — it comes in at nearly 5,000 pounds, much more than most minivans — it had a hard time generating good passing power. That’s not the case anymore. Aided by direct-injection technology, today’s Enclave has surprising pep. It moves out from stoplights and makes quick work of uphill on-ramps; the standard six-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and kicks down without too much delay.\n\nWith seven adults in our front-drive test vehicle, getting up to highway speeds took about all the power the Enclave could muster — but the V-6 was up to the task. All-wheel drive adds another 200 pounds, but short of a full passenger load, that extra weight shouldn’t bother the Enclave.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal feels mushy, and even modest stops induce plenty of forward suspension dive. The Enclave’s EPA gas mileage, at 17/24 mpg city/highway, nearly matches most mom-mobiles, and it’s competitive with other large crossovers. All-wheel drive knocks mileage down to 16/22 mpg. The Enclave also runs fine on regular gas; several luxury competitors recommend or require premium.\n\nThough all crossovers employ carlike independent suspensions, that doesn’t always guarantee ride comfort. Buick has done a nice job here. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, but even with my tester’s optional 20-inch wheels and P255/50R20 tires, the Enclave absorbs bumps and masks highway imperfections well. What’s more, it doesn’t come off feeling floaty and uncontrolled, which is a downside of many soft-riding SUVs, in the process.\n\nAt low speeds, the steering wheel turns with light effort and buttery smoothness. The Enclave has numb reflexes and plenty of body roll, but it points where you want easily enough. At highway speeds, the wheel has appropriately low assist and requires few corrections to stay on course.\n\nRoomy, For a Crossover\nWith convincing faux aluminum trim, upholstered window pillars and plenty of low-gloss, padded surfaces, the Enclave’s cabin feels richer than any well-optioned minivan’s — not to mention its GM siblings. Roomy front seats, a high driving position and an easy-access third row, on the other hand, create a similar feeling: “It’s like a minivan in here,” one backseat passenger said.\n\nWell, almost. The Enclave’s seven seats — eight, if you swap the second-row captain’s chairs for a three-seat bench — and 153 cubic feet of passenger space beat other crossovers but fall short of a Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. That becomes apparent in the second row, where adults will find ample legroom but not enough thigh support. The captain’s chairs sit too low to the ground, and their narrow seatbacks could have larger passengers insisting on sitting up front.\n\nProvided those in the adjustable second-row seats can scoot forward a few clicks, third-row passengers should have enough legroom. The bench seat sits very close to the floor, but so do most third rows.\n\nBehind the third row is 23.2 cubic feet of cargo room, which ranks at the top of the crossover class. Fold all the seats down, and the Enclave’s 115.3 cubic feet of cargo volume is similarly impressive. See how it stacks up against a few competitors — as well as a minivan:\n\nCargo Room Compared\n \t2010 Acura MDX\t2010 Volvo XC90\t2010 Buick Enclave\t2011 Toyota Sienna\nBase price\t$42,230\t$37,700\t$35,515\t$24,260\nOverall length (in.)\t191.6\t189.3\t201.5\t200.2\nMaximum seats\t7\t7\t8\t8\nCargo behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\t15.0\t8.8\t23.2\t39.1\nCargo behind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\t42.9\t43.3\t67.5\t87.1\nCargo behind 1st row (cu. ft.)\t83.5\t85.1\t115.3\t150.0\nSource: Automakers\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nIn front, side and rear-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Enclave scored the top rating, Good. IIHS has yet to perform its new roof-strength tests on the SUV. Standard safety features include front, side-impact and three-row curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard; click here to view a full list.\n\nIn nearly three years on the market, the Enclave’s reliability has been average — better than the Acadia but worse than the Traverse. The MDX and Lexus RX fare better; the XC90 and Audi Q7 fare worse.\n\nAt $35,515, the front-wheel-drive Enclave CX has family-friendly features like a power liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate control in front with manual rear controls, power front seats, and a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack and steering-wheel audio controls. The leather-upholstered CXL-1 runs $38,630, while the top-of-the-line CXL-2 runs $41,995. On any trim, all-wheel drive adds $2,000. Available features on higher trims include heated and cooled seats, a moonroof with a fixed second-row skylight, a navigation system, rear parking sensors and a backup camera.\n\nLoad the Enclave up, and an all-wheel-drive CXL-2 tops out at just over $50,000.\n\nEnclave in the Market\nThough today’s minivans have enough options to spiral beyond $40,000, the market never really saw the need for a dedicated luxury model. Instead we have a collection of luxury crossovers and SUVs, many of which give up a big chunk of utility in the name of styling, performance or plain old opulence. The Enclave provides a compelling response to that: For a reasonable price, it combines near-minivan utility with entry-luxury quality. That’s a rare combination.\n\nDo car shoppers want something like this? I’d say so. Enclave sales are up more than 30 percent in 2010, making it one of GM’s rising stars. Some areas — namely styling and cabin design — will impress less as fresh competition arrives over the next few years, but I suspect the Enclave’s inherent qualities will be harder to beat.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Buick Enclave’s updates are the most significant since the full-size premium crossover SUV emerged as a 2008 model. Even so, the Enclave’s redesign is mild and features new front styling and a revised instrument panel with new technology, as well as ride and handling updates.\n\nWhile the Buick Enclave is slightly nicer inside for 2013, it’s the premium SUV’s roominess and truly usable third row that distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAvailable with seven or eight seats, the Enclave has a $39,340 starting price (including destination charge) and is $3,000 to $7,000 below three-row luxury SUVs like the 2013 Acura MDX, the all-new 2013 Infiniti JX35 and the 2013 Lincoln MKT (compare specifications and features here). The Enclave’s front-wheel-drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) configuration and standard V6 with six-speed automatic transmission carry over from 2012. (See the two model years compared here.)\n\nInterior\nThe 2013 Buick Enclave offers a marginally more luxurious experience than before, with new interior colors and new materials on the instrument panel and doors. Buick is trying to make the Enclave a luxury vehicle, but its puzzle of ill-fitting trim and interior panels isn’t as seamless as what you’ll find in the MDX or JX35. The new Cocoa-colored interior of our tester was cheapened by a sheen and texture that didn’t pop like many luxury interiors featuring a similar color choice.\n\nOverall, Acura’s and Infiniti’s SUVs offer more luxurious materials and finishes for those concerned more about niceness than maximum usability. The 2013 Enclave’s new blue ambient lighting, real chrome accents and detail stitching around the dashboard add flair, though they don’t fully compensate for other lacking details.\n\nThe Enclave is the most premium full-size crossover among its General Motors chassis-mates — the GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Traverse — which were also redesigned for 2013. The 2013 Traverse’s and Acadia’s interior improvements are more notable compared with the Enclave, which takes a skip compared to the others’ jump. A more stylish design, real chrome accents, generous use of convincing faux wood and a chrome-trimmed analog clock differentiate the Enclave’s interior from its siblings. The Traverse and Acadia can have many of the Enclave’s features in the same size package, including a moonroof with a fixed rear skylight, a power passenger seat, heated and cooled front seats, 20-inch alloy wheels and a multimedia system with advanced smartphone integration for Pandora and Stitcher internet radio applications.\n\nThe Buick Enclave is, of course, styled differently and has many more standard features for its higher starting price, like high-intensity-discharge headlights, remote start and a power liftgate. Leather is not included, however; the Enclave’s base Convenience trim level has standard cloth seating. Leather seats come standard in the two higher trim levels, Buick Enclave Leather AWD and Premium (compare the three levels side-by-side here). One glaring omission common in other luxury cars is a smart key system. Smart key systems allow the key to stay in a pocket or purse while the driver unlocks the car through touch and starts it via a button. The Enclave uses a traditional key ignition system with remote locking and unlocking.\n\nWhere Buick keeps up with tech offerings is its standard IntelliLink touch-screen, replacing the 2012’s aging navigation and multimedia offerings. The 7-inch touch-screen pairs with a standard backup camera, Bluetooth telephone connectivity and streaming audio, USB input and satellite radio. Navigation is optional. Internet streaming radio applications pair with compatible smartphones. The system is hampered by having touch-sensitive capacitive controls instead of physical buttons for switching sources and navigation. The traditional tuning and volume dials improve usability.\n\nRoominess\nThe Buick Enclave’s average interior niceness is far from a deal-breaker for those who really need the room. The Acura MDX and Infiniti JX are more opulent, yet neither can comfortably fit an adult in the third row like the Enclave does. The 2013 Enclave dwarfs its competitors with near-minivan spaciousness in all three rows of seats — plus exceptional comfort. Standard seating for seven includes two captain’s chairs in the second row, which is ideal for those who plan to make frequent use of the third row, as the aisle between the seats is wide enough for adults to easily scoot past. The captain’s chairs also recline and slide forward and back, providing ample room for third-row passengers while maintaining sufficient legroom for occupants in the captain’s chairs, even when they’re slid completely forward. A second-row bench seat with room for three is a no-cost option to bump seating capacity to eight.\n\nCargo room is even more impressive, measuring 115.2 cubic feet of maximum volume when the easy-to-fold seats are laid flat. The 2013 MDX rates at 83.5 cubic feet, the JX35 has 76.5 cubic feet and the MKT measures 75.9 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. The Enclave still isn’t as voluminous as a minivan, which typically boasts volume in the 140s.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe updated Enclave is less bug-eyed and features a more prominent grille and LED daytime running lamps, as well as a new hood, fenders and rocker moldings. The look is more cohesive and proportional. The Enclave’s staple two-tone paint with dark lower accents is gone in favor of a single exterior color, which looks classier.\n\nAll Buick Enclaves feature high-intensity-discharge front projector lighting standard while adaptive lighting that turns in the direction of the steering wheel is optional. Changes are less apparent out back, with new LED taillights and tailpipes now integrated into the rear bumper.\n\nOn the Road\nThe 2013’s ride is a more luxurious experience than before. It’s less minivan and more Mercedes, with a new suspension package adding a sense of composure and solidity in how the car absorbs bumps. The Enclave is still a large SUV, but it feels nimbler than before, with fewer similarities to a minivan.\n\nDriving the Buick Enclave is pleasant except for the times when the thick A-pillars and large side mirrors block forward visibility. Cars and pedestrians can hide in the A-pillar blind spot, which is especially troublesome at stop signs where cross traffic doesn’t stop.\n\nThe Enclave’s transmission hadn’t offered much driving confidence before 2013. New transmission tuning helps the car accelerate effortlessly by holding the gears longer and being smarter and quicker about when to downshift for passing. The Buick Enclave’s 3.6-liter V6 makes 288 horsepower. Gas mileage is unchanged from 2012, at an EPA-estimated 16/22 mpg city/highway with AWD and 17/24 mpg with FWD. Until the redesigned 2014 Acura MDX is available in summer 2013, with estimates of 18/27 mpg for AWD models, you won’t find much better mileage among large three-row SUVs. The Enclave can tow up to 4,500 pounds with an available towing package.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Enclave performs well in both Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing. The Enclave was named a Top Safety Pick by IIHS, scoring Good in frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The Buick Enclave earned five out of five stars overall in the NHTSA tests.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes a new style of airbag that deploys from the driver’s seat between the driver and passenger to help protect front occupants who aren’t on the side of an impact. Other airbags include frontal and front-seat side-impact ones, plus side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating. Standard head restraints are four-way adjustable. See more standard safety features here.\n\nNewly available safety features include blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, which are standard on the more expensive Leather and Premium Group trim levels. See how well child-safety seats fit in the Enclave in our Car Seat Check.\n\n2013 Buick Enclave in the Market\nWhat the Buick Enclave lacks in cabin quality, it makes up for in roominess across all three rows of seats. There are more luxurious SUVs and roomier family-haulers, but the Enclave offers an unrivaled blend of premium niceness and family friendliness.\n\nThe combination is working for Buick. The Buick Enclave is the brand’s best-selling model through March 2013, with sales up 55 percent compared with 2012.\n\nemail",

The captain’s chairs also recline and slide forward and back, providing ample room for third-row passengers while maintaining sufficient legroom for occupants in the captain’s chairs, even when they’re slid completely forward. A second-row bench seat with room for three is a no-cost option to bump seating capacity to eight.\n\nCargo room is even more impressive, measuring 115.2 cubic feet of maximum volume when the easy-to-fold seats are laid flat. The 2013 MDX rates at 83.5 cubic feet, the JX35 has 76.5 cubic feet and the MKT measures 75.9 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. The Enclave still isn’t as voluminous as a minivan, which typically boasts volume in the 140s.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe updated Enclave is less bug-eyed and features a more prominent grille and LED daytime running lamps, as well as a new hood, fenders and rocker moldings. The look is more cohesive and proportional. The Enclave’s staple two-tone paint with dark lower accents is gone in favor of a single exterior color, which looks classier.\n\nAll Enclaves feature high-intensity-discharge front projector lighting standard while adaptive lighting that turns in the direction of the steering wheel is optional. Changes are less apparent out back, with new LED taillights and tailpipes now integrated into the rear bumper.\n\nOn the Road\nThe 2013’s ride is a more luxurious experience than before. It’s less minivan and more Mercedes, with a new suspension package adding a sense of composure and solidity in how the car absorbs bumps. The Enclave is still a large SUV, but it feels nimbler than before, with fewer similarities to a minivan.\n\nDriving the Enclave is pleasant except for the times when the thick A-pillars and large side mirrors block forward visibility. Cars and pedestrians can hide in the A-pillar blind spot, which is especially troublesome at stop signs where cross traffic doesn’t stop.\n\nThe Enclave’s transmission hadn’t offered much driving confidence before 2013. New transmission tuning helps the car accelerate effortlessly by holding the gears longer and being smarter and quicker about when to downshift for passing. The Enclave’s 3.6-liter V-6 makes 288 horsepower. Gas mileage is unchanged from 2012, at an EPA-estimated 16/22 mpg city/highway with all-wheel drive and 17/24 mpg with front-wheel drive. Until the redesigned 2014 Acura MDX is available in summer 2013, with estimates of 18/27 mpg for all-wheel-drive models, you won’t find much better mileage among large three-row SUVs. The Enclave can tow up to 4,500 pounds with an available towing package.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Enclave performs well in both Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing. The Enclave was named a Top Safety Pick by IIHS, scoring Good in frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The Enclave earned five out of five stars overall in the NHTSA tests.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes a new style of airbag that deploys from the driver’s seat between the driver and passenger to help protect front occupants who aren’t on the side of an impact. Other airbags include frontal and front-seat side-impact ones, plus side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating. Standard head restraints are four-way adjustable. See more standard safety features here.\n\nNewly available safety features include blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, which are standard on the more expensive Leather and Premium Group trim levels. See how well child-safety seats fit in the Enclave in our Car Seat Check.\n\n2013 Buick Enclave in the Market\nWhat the Enclave lacks in cabin quality, it makes up for in roominess across all three rows of seats. There are more luxurious SUVs and roomier family-haulers, but the Enclave offers an unrivaled blend of premium niceness and family friendliness.\n\nThe combination is working for Buick. The Enclave is the brand’s best-selling model through March 2013, with sales up 55 percent compared with 2012.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Buick Enclave Avenir is a dated boat of a three-row SUV that doesn’t live up to its price or the high-end promises of the Avenir name; it only impresses when it comes to interior room.\n\nVersus the competition: The Enclave Avenir feels behind both the times and its class, despite being on the pricier side in an incredibly competitive segment.\n\nA good three-row SUV should excel at carrying lots of people and their things in relative comfort. According to those criteria, the 2023 Buick Enclave Avenir is a good three-row SUV. Driving one, however, left me frustrated twice over: first with the Enclave Avenir’s basic flaws and inability to live up to its premium pitch or price, and second with the sincere belief that, in nearly every respect, there are better three-row SUVs on the market that Enclave shoppers might not even consider.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2024 Buick Encore GX: Got the Looks, Needs More Guts?\n\nThe 2023 Enclave is available in three trim levels: Essence, Premium and the top-of-the-line Avenir that we tested. Power for every Enclave comes from a 3.6-liter V-6 engine making 310 horsepower, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Buyers can choose front- or all-wheel drive at every trim level; our test vehicle came with AWD.\n\nSo what does the Enclave Avenir get right? What does it get wrong? And why does it frustrate me so much?\n\nThe Good\n\nLet’s start with the good stuff. Pretty much every seat in the Enclave Avenir is a comfortable place to sit; there’s decent cushioning, lots of room in the first two rows and adequate space for adults in the third. The front seats are the place to be, though, especially in the Avenir, which adds a massage function to both front seats, along with seat heating and ventilation. The second row is also spacious and comfortable, and adults should be fine piling into the third row for a trip across town, though I wouldn’t want to be back there on a road trip.\n\nThe Enclave Avenir’s technology is not the most up-to-date, but what’s there works fairly well. An 8-inch dashboard touchscreen is easy to use, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are welcome. The Enclave also has plenty of physical controls for audio and climate functions. If I were feeling charitable, I’d call the control layout “familiar.” If I were feeling less charitable, I might call it “dated,” but at least it all works. The gauge cluster combines traditional and digital readouts, but it’s uncluttered and easy to decipher. The Avenir’s rearview camera mirror is a helpful touch, especially when passengers or cargo block the view out back — although I did get slightly motion sick when using it.\n\nRide comfort is a highlight, as well, with a well-cushioned demeanor that befits the Enclave’s price and flagship status. An optional adaptive damping suspension really pays off; the driver and passengers will be aware of bumps, potholes and other road imperfections, but they’ll rarely be upset by harsh impacts.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe Bad\n\nOur family car needed repairs around 2010, and for some reason the body shop had a late third- or early fourth-generation Mercury Grand Marquis as a loaner car. I recall taking strange delight in how soft its suspension was and how much it rocked and rolled over the unpaved roads leading to our home — and that’s how driving the 2023 Enclave Avenir felt, sans the delight. This time, I was concerned (and occasionally scared) by how wobbly the Enclave felt in corners and how easily it could be unsettled by bumps or evasive maneuvers.\n\nThe Enclave also suffers from poor braking feel. Nonlinear pedal feel and a lack of initial bite in its brakes contribute to making the Enclave feel heavier than even its handling issues did. Anything other than the most sedate driving style will take the Enclave well out of its comfort zone.\n\nThe Enclave’s nine-speed automatic transmission is also clunky, and it wasn’t always up to the tasks I gave it. Rather than rapid, multigear downshifts on hard acceleration, it downshifts slowly from gear to gear. Upshifts are unobjectionable for a large premium SUV.\n\nTogether, the brakes and transmission behavior make the Enclave feel both heavier than it is and underpowered, despite the should-be-adequate 310 hp from its 3.6-liter V-6. EPA-estimated fuel economy is also slightly subpar at 20 mpg combined; other premium SUVs do a bit better.\n\nInside, the issues are legion. While the multimedia system works well, its 8-inch touchscreen is small by today’s standards. In addition, cabin materials don’t live up to the AWD Enclave Avenir’s $62,000-plus price tag. Hard plastics abound, and the physical controls lack a premium feel. Portions of the gauge cluster look at least a decade old, too. The gear selector was redesigned for the 2022 model year and now features a series of buttons that are both slightly unintuitive to use — Reverse and Drive are almost levers but not quite — and save no space.\n\nA specific nit worth picking is the fact that only the passenger-side second-row seat tilts and folds for easy third-row access. The space it leaves to climb in is fine, but why only do this on one side? Granted, the passenger side will be curbside in most street-parking situations, but there are numerous parking scenarios where it makes sense to load from the driver’s side, too, like in a driveway or parking lot. It seems silly and old-fashioned not to have access to the third row on both sides.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Buick Encore GX: Pint-Sized Premium Gets Update, Price Drop\n2023 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\n2023 Buick Envision Gains New Colors and a Price Bump\n2023 Buick Enclave Gains New Color, Small Price Hike\nShop for a 2023 Buick Enclave\nPrice Is a Pain Point\n\nThe most significant issue for the Enclave Avenir is its price. The SUV we drove had a sticker price of $62,090 (including destination), a price that’s competitive with the Infiniti QX60, Acura MDX and Lexus RX, but all three of those vehicles have much nicer interiors, more modern technology and better driving characteristics.\n\nThe same is true of more mainstream three-row SUVs. The Kia Telluride, Hyundai Palisade and Honda Pilot, for example, are all better choices that cost less than the Enclave Avenir — even when fully loaded. Only shopping “domestic” brands? A Ford Explorer King Ranch would be a better — and likely less expensive — choice, too, and its luxury cousin, the Lincoln Aviator, is worth its price premium over the Enclave.\n\nIf the Enclave Avenir were priced in the $40,000 range, it would feel like a good value for the money. At more than $60K, it simply doesn’t. Granted, that’s a suggested price, and buyers may qualify for a variety of discounts (or just be really good at haggling), but without either of those benefits bringing the price way down, I’d steer clear of the Enclave Avenir.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Buick Enclave?\n\nThe 2020 Buick Enclave is a premium three-row SUV with room for up to seven people. It’s powered by a 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Both front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Buick Enclave?\n\nA new 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system is standard, and Premium and Avenir trim levels gain massaging front seats. A new Sport Touring Edition features 20-inch aluminum wheels and a unique grille. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Buick Enclave Are Most Important?\n\nThe second-row SmartSlide seat gives easy access to the third row from the right side of the Enclave, and a rear-seat reminder is designed to help you avoid forgetting anything in the backseat. An available 360-degree camera system ensures optimal visibility, while a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot comes standard to keep you connected on the road (data trial included). \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Buick Enclave?\n\nIf you have a big family and a lot of cargo to haul, the Enclave will likely meet your needs. However, considering the Enclave’s pricing its cabin could be more luxurious, and we wish all trims came with the advanced safety features that go in uplevel Enclaves.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Buick Enclave?\n\nThe 2019 Enclave is a premium three-row SUV with room for up to seven occupants. It has a 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Both front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Competitors include the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Buick Enclave?\n\nThe Enclave is now available in a front-wheel-drive Preferred trim level, and an automatic heated steering wheel is standard on the Premium and Avenir trims.\n\nHow Does the 2019 Buick Enclave Compare to Other Three-row SUVs?\n\nBuick tries to stand out by being more premium than mainstream SUVs but without the prices of high-end luxury brands. Its interior space is a match for any competitor in the class. Third-row space, seating position and overall comfort win out over the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Buick Enclave Are Most Important?\n\nSecond-row SmartSlide seats give easy access to the third row, and a rear-seat reminder is designed to help you avoid forgetting anything in the backseat. An available rear camera mirror and a 360-degree camera system ensure optimal visibility, while a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot comes standard to keep you connected on the road (data trial included).\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Buick Enclave?\n\nIf you’re a big family with a lot of cargo to haul but are willing to miss some of the luxury that comes with a high-end SUV, the Enclave might be a good fit. If you’re looking for an especially elegant design, another luxury SUV may be more appealing.",

      "expert_review": "For 2018, Buick completely redesigned its oldest SUV: the big Enclave, a three-row SUV that seats seven. The premium familyhauler is aimed, Buick says, at buyers with a little more money and a more aspirational outlook than shoppers of, say, its GM sister vehicle, the Chevrolet Traverse — or a minivan.\n\nBuick is also trying to inch a little closer to the luxury brands with the introduction of an upmarket Avenir trim level of the Enclave. Buick plans to introduce Avenir versions across its lineup in hopes of cloning the success GMC has had with dressed-up Denali versions of its vehicles. The Enclave also comes in its base, Essence and Premium trim levels.\n\nThree-row crossovers are an increasingly competitive vehicle class. Buick aims to stand out by being more premium than mainstream SUVs, but without trying to match high-end luxury brands (and their nosebleed prices). The Enclave’s archrival in that space is the Acura MDX, and its competition also includes the Infiniti QX60. Nipping at its heels, meanwhile, are higher trim levels of three-row SUVs from mainstream brands.\n\nI drove the new Enclave on highways and back roads in Georgia and North Carolina at a Buick-hosted launch event. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays its airfare and lodging expenses for such events.) I spent some time in the new Avenir to assess what it brings to the party, but my primary test vehicle was a well-optioned Enclave Premium priced at $56,455 including destination.\n\nLooking Good Is Half the Battle\n\nThe new Buick Enclave resembles its predecessor (a favorite of mine among the related big SUVs from GM), but with some sharper sculpting, a little more drama up front and a trendy “floating roof” look. The grille is bigger and more defined, with separate inserts for regular and Avenir models. A cool signature feature is stretched pods for the standard LED headlights, accented with LED-backlit Acrylite panels (OK, yes, I’m a sucker for light effects).\n\nOne functional aspect of the new design is better visibility to the front. The Buick Enclave still has the fat windshield pillars common to most Buicks, but the positioning of the side mirrors on the front doors, plus a small, extra triangle window in each door, go a long way toward helping with the old model’s blind spots, which could hide a pedestrian or bicyclist.\n\nQuiet Zone\n\nThe most striking feature of the interior is its hush throughout, thanks to extra door sealing and insulation, acoustic windshield and front door glass, and Bose active noise cancelation. Even on gravel back roads, the SUV was quiet enough for normal conversation or enjoying the available Bose premium sound system (it’s standard on the Premium and Avenir).\n\nInterior materials are high-quality, yet they plant the Enclave squarely in just the premium or near-luxury category. The design aims at simplicity but succeeds in being blander than the outgoing Enclave. Sometimes less is more; sometimes it’s just less.\n\nThe Enclave’s interior is a mix of attention to detail and some missteps. The cupholder cover is cleverly designed so things won’t get lost in the gap when it opens, but the cupholders themselves are hard, one-size-fits-all circles that leave some cups loose or rattling.\n\nInterior surfaces are pleasing to the eye and mostly soft to the touch, but they devolve into more mainstream-brand plastic close to the floor and in the back row. There’s also prominent use of faux wood and metal-finish plastic trim. This is not an Audi Q7 luxury hauler, but neither is it priced like one. By comparison, the rival MDX looks a little downscale in terms of design and some materials next to the new Enclave. The Buick also has ample interior storage spaces for a family, including a handy purse-size storage space under the console.\n\nSize Matters\n\nWhile Buick continues to call the Enclave mid-size, it is one big SUV — a little bigger, even, than the outgoing model, with roughly the footprint of the truck-based, full-size GMC Yukon SUV. It’s substantially bigger than the downsized GMC Acadia (formerly a sister, like the Traverse), which now rides a shorter-wheelbase version of this new platform. It wears the “mid-size” label more comfortably.\n\nThe Buick Enclave’s interior space is a match for any competitor short of a minivan. The front seats — leather in all but the base Enclave — are big and well-padded. They were comfortable even for an all-day drive. Other drivers, however, felt the wide center console intruded on their knee space.\n\nThe second row features standard captain’s chairs (heated on the Premium and Avenir) that offer a comfortable seating position, with about 15 inches of seat height, plus recline and slide for more room — or for compromising with third-row passengers.\n\nThe third row — a primary reason to get a big SUV — proved more than acceptable for adults (two, anyway), a fact Buick highlighted by putting journalists back there while shuttling around Atlanta, and even for airport runs that pushed two hours. Our test vehicle’s double moonroof helped alleviate the cave-like feeling common to many third rows.\n\nThird-row space, seating position (height is about 13 inches) and overall comfort beat the MDX and QX60. There’s also better walk-in access thanks to the slightly longer wheelbase, big rear doors and a standard tilt-and-slide captain’s chair, which operates even with a forward-facing child seat in place. Just the passenger side chair moves this way, however, which Buick says is a GM safety edict.\n\nThere was enough leg and shoulder room in the third row for a pair of 6-foot-plus adults seated behind adults in the second row. Headroom, however, was limited by the curve of the roof, a problem not encountered in the more squared-off Traverse or Volkswagen’s new Atlas. My head rested against the sloping headliner. There are seat belts for three in the back, but if you regularly haul three back there, you might want to consider a minivan.\n\nThe big Enclave also excels when it comes to cargo space: 23.6 cubic feet with the third row up and 58 with it folded (power folding optional). With both rows down, there are 97.6 cubic feet. There’s also a useful 3-cubic-foot bin under the rear cargo floor, below which is a cleverly hidden temporary spare tire. If cargo space is important, the Enclave should be your choice over the MDX, which has 15.8/43.4/90.9 cubic feet to hold your stuff. And if the Enclave’s inside space isn’t enough, it can tow 5,000 pounds with the trailer package. The MDX has the same rating.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Enclave’s revised 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is plenty punchy for the kind of driving a vehicle like this will see. The new nine-speed transmission is mostly smooth and responsive; it’s not too quick on the upshift in the service of fuel economy but has quick, positive downshifts for passing. It seemed tuned to be unobtrusive and went about its business mostly without fuss. The only quarrel I had with it was its behavior at lower speeds — where I encountered some hesitation and stumbling with both downshifts and upshifts — and its handling of quick accelerator pedal motions.\n\nThe powertrain (and shedding more than 350 pounds) makes the 2018 feel gutsier than the old Buick Enclave, with an acceptable zero-to-60-mph time of 6.4 seconds (7.1 with all-wheel drive), Buick says. Fuel economy is also significantly better, in part thanks to an engine stop-start system that you can’t turn off. The 2018’s EPA-estimated combined gas mileage rating is up 3 mpg, to 21 mpg, with front-wheel drive; it’s rated 20 mpg combined with all-wheel drive. Compare the 2018 and 2017 here. Those numbers still lag the MDX and QX60; compare them here.\n\nThe transmission includes an “L” position that allows you to limit the range of gears the transmission will use, plus steering-wheel paddle shifters that let you select gears within the range. It’s not a true manual mode, but it proved useful on up-and-down and winding mountain roads. A more questionable feature was the transmission shifter, however: an electronic toggle you’ll get used to but never love. At least the lack of mechanical connection gets you a big storage space underneath.\n\nThe Enclave offers two tiers of all-wheel drive: a simpler system ($2,000) that’s optional on the Essence trim, and a more sophisticated system ($2,300) for Premium and Avenir models. The more sophisticated system adds a twin-clutch rear differential that can shift torque between the left and right rear wheels, in addition to being able to shift up to 40 percent to the rear wheels in most situations. On our Premium model, it proved more than up to dealing with both loose gravel roads and Georgia red clay, as well as providing a handling boost on winding mountain roads. The base model does not offer either AWD system.\n\nThe Buick Enclave Premium I tested did not have GM’s adaptive suspension system with a Sport setting; that’s an option on the Avenir only. The regular suspension, though, with a new multilink design in the rear, combined a very comfortable ride with competent handling — though badly broken pavement could rattle its composure. There was less-than-expected lean in corners for such a tall, heavy vehicle — a departure from the old Enclave, which was comfortable but never let you forget its height. Steering didn’t offer much road feedback, but it was precise and nicely weighted. The Enclave really was in its element on the freeway, where it invites you to run up the miles, but it didn’t feel out of place or control while winding around rural mountain roads. The optional 20-inch wheels ($1,400) didn’t seem to hurt ride comfort, though the 18s that are standard on all but the Avenir would likely be cushier.\n\nTechno Pop\n\nEnclaves come loaded with connections for the tech-intensive family, including two USB ports (both data) in a device bin under the dashboard and a 12-volt outlet below the console. The second row has a pair of USB charging ports and a 12-volt and household outlet, and even the back row has a pair of USB ports. There’s also a 12-volt power outlet in the cargo area.\n\nThe Buick Enclave’s multimedia system is GM’s latest. It continues to be one of the most intuitive, user-friendly systems available, and it includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The 8-inch touchscreen display is crisp, and system response was fast. The system also offers up to 60 quick-access buttons with stored settings, from favorite stations and satellite radio channels to navigation destinations.\n\nAvailable is a rear-seat entertainment system with two 8-inch seatback screens and SD, USB, HDMI and wireless connectivity — with or without a DVD player.\n\nOnStar provides emergency communications as well as a subscription-based 4G LTE connection for the Enclave’s onboard Wi-Fi. The Premier I drove had the available 360-degree camera display, which offers surround, front and rear views. It comes in an $825 option package (it’s standard on the Avenir) that also includes GM’s rearview mirror video system that can switch from a regular mirror to a camera image of a wider, unobstructed view of the traffic behind you even when you’re driving forward.\n\nBuick’s interior designers went with a cleaner, simpler look for the dash, which means fewer buttons and knobs. Thankfully they at least left a large, easy-to-reach knob for audio volume. (But why not a tuner knob, as well?)\n\nInexplicable Safety Exclusivity\n\nThe 2018 Enclave had not been crash-tested by the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as of publication.\n\nThe Buick offers top-of-the-line safety technology, but unfortunately reserves it for high-rollers who opt for the Buick Enclave Avenir — and even then, it’s in a $2,095 option package. The package includes a full-speed front collision prevention system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, as well as adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability. It’s bundled with the adaptive suspension. It’s inexplicable that this level of safety technology is unavailable on other trim levels of a premium SUV given GM’s stated commitment to safety — not to mention the proliferation of similarly competent systems to even compact cars these days.\n\nInstead, you have to move up to the Essence trim level just to get rear cross-traffic warning and blind spot warning with lane change alert; that system looks beyond the blind spot for cars approaching quickly in the next lane. The Premium and Avenir add standard lane-keeping assist, front and rear parking sensors, and a low-speed front collision system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection.\n\nNear-Luxury Value\n\nThe 2018 Buick Enclave starts at a base price of $40,990, but Buick said anyone wanting that rock-bottom price should expect to have to order one; dealers are unlikely to have any sitting on their lots. The Essence starts at $45,210 with front-wheel drive, and the Premium is $49,010. All those prices are up a few hundred dollars from 2017. The new deluxe Avenir model starts at $54,410.\n\nAs a premium-brand product, the Buick Enclave offers value for buyers wanting a step up from mainstream SUVs but not the higher prices or showiness of a luxury one from the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Lexus. In that in-between space, the new Buick Enclave should have no trouble competing on value versus the MDX and QX60. It’s fresher, far more spacious, competitively priced and definitely more up-to-date and user-friendly in terms of multimedia tech and connectivity. Compare it with these rivals here.\n\nIt’s trickier for the Enclave (or the MDX for that matter) to claim status value over higher trim levels of the also-redone Chevy Traverse (which has a new, luxury High Country trim level) or the all-new Volkswagen Atlas in its SEL Premium garb. Both veer into the Buick Enclave’s lane with quality materials and premium features. The Enclave has a classier badge and a higher-style look and feel, but also a bit higher price for a comparably equipped model. Volkswagen also offers significantly longer warranty coverage than GM, at six years/72,000 miles. Buick can, however, claim Top 10 brand reliability in Consumer Reports ratings. That beats Chevrolet and Volkswagen, but all three are solid three-row alternatives to a minivan — it might just come down to the look that appeals to you. Compare these vehicles here.\n\nA separate value question is raised by the new Enclave Avenir. Buick says the vast majority of Enclave buyers already opt for higher trim levels, so it was a no-brainer to come up with a fancier — and profitable — sub-brand like GMC’s Denali. The Avenir does offer a bit nicer interior trim in an exclusive Chestnut Brown color (the only choice), plus other unique design tweaks, such as its own wheels and grille. And it has some more standard features, such as real wood trim on the steering wheel, and safety options (though I’d expect the latter to migrate down the food chain in later years). Still, I’m not convinced Buick put enough into its first Avenir model to justify spending another $5,000 above the well-equipped and satisfying Enclave Premium.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Buick Enclave offers three rows of seats standard, with seating for up to eight people. While its sibling, the GMC Acadia, competes with garden-variety Hondas and Toyotas, Buick says the Enclave will go head-to-head with the Volvo XC90 and Acura MDX, among other crossovers.\n\nNew for 2012\nA hill-hold feature, which keeps the Enclave from rolling backward on inclines, is standard. The Enclave also has an enhanced brake override system, which cuts engine power when the gas and brake pedals are depressed. An accessory power outlet has been added to the center console.\n\nExterior\nThe Enclave is about an inch longer than the Acadia and features some traditional Buick styling bits, including a waterfall grille and portholes on the flanks. Exterior features include:\n\n\nSculpted ellipsoid headlights\nWaterfall grille and louvered gills\nStandard 19-inch aluminum wheels; 20-inch chrome-clad wheels optional\nDual exhaust\n\n\nInterior\nBuick says the Enclave’s interior strives to emulate that of a private jet. The second-row bucket seats slide forward and back, and the second and third rows fold to provide extra cargo room. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard bucket seats in the first and second rows\nThree-passenger third-row bench\nOptional three-passenger second-row bench seat for eight-person seating\nOptional heated and cooled seats for driver, front passenger\nOptional navigation system and Bose 10-speaker stereo\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.6-liter V-6 is the only engine available in the Enclave. It pairs with a six-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Enclave can tow up to 4,500 pounds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n288 horsepower and 270 pounds-feet of torque\nUses regular gas\nOptional all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats\nDuring a rollover, side curtain airbags stay inflated for several moments to provide additional protection",
