      "expert_review": "The boomers have aged to the point where they want the increased comfort and convenience afforded by four doors. So they’ve been buying sedans — and relegating coupe sales to life in the sewers of Paris.\n\nIndeed, the sales figures have sunk low enough to trigger the demise of several coupe models. Toyota has stopped making a coupe version of its popular Camry, and Ford has sent the Thunderbird winging off to that native automobile burial mound on the outskirts of Dearborn.\n\nBut so far, the Buick Riviera has been spared such indignities. Despite the coupe climate — and the fact that the Riv isn’t the import that so many low-end luxury-car buyers want — this big, beautiful Buick keeps on chugging along, selling about 20,000 copies a year.\n\nI suspect there are several reasons for this. For openers, the Riv is easily the most distinctive and dramatically sculpted luxury car to come along in this decade. It is also an exceptional value. Most low-end luxury cars (the Riv starts at $32,500) are midsize, not large. They aren’t this gutsy (240 horsepower), and they aren’t this well-equipped (leather is standard).\n\nBut while the Riv may be a deal, its styling is what makes this car so interesting. The Riviera’s body design pushes the envelope of the acceptable, and creates intense feelings. People either love it or hate it.\n\nI love the way this car looks. It is so sensual and voluptuous. And it has those wonderful front-fender bevels adjacent to the hood that disappear and reappear as your viewing angle changes. So what happens, in effect, is that the car keeps reinventing itself as you walk around it.\n\nThere is something mysterious about this changing state, and that mystery was compounded by the test car’s Slate Green Pearl paint, a new-for-’98 color that changed with the lighting conditions.\n\nBut I must emphasize that my slavish worship is only half of the Riv’s love/hate story. A colleague told me the car looked like a dead fish.\n\nActually, even I must admit that the Riv is not aesthetic perfection. Its otherwise attractive interior is marred by a homely, dated dashboard populated by cheezoid gauges and phony-baloney wood trim.\n\nAs its standard leather and large-car roominess might suggest, the Riv is a comfortable way for four adults to get from point A to point B. And as its grottoesque, 17.4-cubic-foot trunk might suggest, those four folks will be able to bring along plenty of extra socks and undies.\n\nThe Riv’s solidity contributes to a pleasant passage. The Riviera is built on the exceptionally rigid platform used in the Oldsmobile Aurora. That lack of flex encourages squeak and creak to catch a ride in someone else’s car.\n\nThanks to a decree from the marketing molehill, Buick doesn’t build any of that sporty kid stuff that we arrested adolescents like so much. But the Riviera has received some performance improvements for 1998 that make it livelier than you might have guessed.\n\nThe 240-horsepower, supercharged version of General Motors’ 3.8-liter V-6 is no longer an option in the Riv. It is now standard equipment. And with a substantial 280 foot-pounds of torque, it gets this 3,700-pound car off the dime in a big hurry.\n\nThe engineers have also tweaked the Riv’s suspension again to enhance handling. Although the suspension is still too soft for my taste, the car certainly acquits itself well enough in the corners. The steering is responsive, and a reduction in body roll has made the car feel more composed.\n\nThe Riv’s standard equipment list is as long as Wilt Chamberlain’s inseam. It includes several items you’d expect in a luxury car, such as disc brakes and an antilock braking system, and some you might not, such as dual-zone climate control and a cassette/CD player.\n\nYou’re also getting a nicely assembled car that’s surprisingly easy on gas, and doesn’t break very much.\n\nSPECS\n\nBuick Riviera\n\nBase vehicle Front-drive, 3.8-liter engine, magnetic variable-assist power steering, power disc brakes, antilock braking system, 16-inch alloy wheels, P225/60R16 all-season radials, dual air bags, daytime running lights, power locks, keyless entry, electric trunk release, power windows, heated power mirrors, dual-zone climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, tilt steering, cruise control, automatic suspension leveling, rear window defogger, stereo/cassette/CD, power antenna, leather seating, power seats, theft-deterrence system.\n\nTest model: Traction control, cornering lamps, augmented theft-deterrence system, power lumbar supports for front seats, universal transmitter, steering-wheel-mounted radio controls, chrome-plated alloy wheels, driver’s seat heater and memory, automatic rear-view mirror with compass.\n\nBase price: $32,500\n\nTest model: $35,490 (inc. shipping)\n\nEPA city rating: 18\n\nTest mileage: 19\n\nWarranty: Three years/36,000 miles bumper to bumper.",

      "expert_review": "Draw up a list of some of the best-looking coupes on the market, and the 1996 Buick Riviera would be near the top with most car aficionados.\n\nSleek in a way that sets it apart from its competitors, the current Riviera is a worthy descendant of the stunning 1963 Riviera, which helped define the luxury sports coupe genre.\n\nThe good looks have helped put some bright news on Buick’s tally sheet. For 1995, Buick moved more than 25,000 Rivieras — close to its production capacity of about 30,000 units a year.\n\nSuch success flies in the face of Buick’s shrinking market share.\n\nAlthough the General Motors division sold more than 488,000 cars in 1995, that was down from 535,000 in 1994. Market share has slipped from 6 to 5.6 percent.\n\nSome of the weakness in the Buick lineup come as the division, which traditionally ranks just below Cadillac in the GM marketing scheme, struggles to attract younger buyers with less-expensive cars.\n\nTaking on Toyota’s tough\n\nWhile offering solid, well-equipped cars such as the Century and Skylark at list prices well below $20,000 is a worthy goal, Buick has not met with much success going door- handle-to-door-handle with the likes of Toyota.\n\nBuick faces a long haul in getting younger buyers — who often have no tradition of owning GM cars — to give their lower-priced models a spin.\n\nGiven the success of the Riviera, perhaps the division should concentrate more on its upscale products.\n\nThat is not to say that the Riviera is perfect. What it lacks, to some degree, is the performance to back up that cutting-edge look.\n\nThe suspension has been tuned to appeal more to traditional Buick buyers — who apparently appreciate taking the feel of their family room sofa on the road.\n\nIt’s not that the Riviera handles poorly — it’s competent — but it lacks a fun-to-drive feel of, say, a Mazda Millennia or even an Oldsmobile Aurora.\n\nNumb but quiet\n\nThere is a lot of body roll in tight turns, and the power steering feels numb.\n\nOn the plus side, the Riviera is very quiet on the inside, taking on an almost churchlike quality.\n\nSuch hushed tones are befitting a Buick Park Avenue, but seem ill-placed in a Riviera, which should give the driver useful road feedback and a throaty roar from the exhaust pipes during hard acceleration.\n\nOne way in which Buick has perked up the Riviera is by offering an optional 3.8-liter supercharged V-6, which puts out 240 horsepower.\n\nCoupled to the four-speed automatic transmission, the supercharged Riviera can get to 60 mph in about 7.1 seconds, yet squeeze between 17 and 27 miles from a gallon of gasoline.\n\nWhile V-6’s numbers impress, the engine still fails to stir the soul. It gets the job done in about the same fashion as the V-8 powered Olds Aurora, but stabbing the accelerator in the Olds is a far more entertaining exercise.\n\nInterior’s a classic\n\nOne area in which the Riviera gets high marks is interior styling. The dashboard uses flat surfaces with round air vents and instrument clusters to create a classic look. Of all the cars rolling out of Detroit, the Riviera has the most pleasing interior.\n\nSince it’s built on the same front-wheel-drive chassis as the four-door Aurora, the two-door Riviera has a back seat that is unusually large for a coupe.\n\nRear headroom is somewhat compromised by the body’s cigar shape, but two adults can be hauled around in comfort, and a third grown-up can be squeezed back there for short periods.\n\nPrice is also a selling point, which is a theme these days at Buick. The base price of the Riviera is a tad over $30,000; a supercharged model lists for about $34,000.\n\nWhen you consider that a number of sport utility vehicles and minivans list for about the same, it’s easy to see that the Riviera offers a lot of style for the money.\n\nIt’s just a shame that Buick didn’t see fit to push the performance and handling en lope to match the promise of the Riviera’s styling.\n\nSPECS\nBase sticker price: $30,010.\nPrice as tested: $34,450.\nMajor options on test car: Supercharged V-6, $1,195.\nEngine: Supercharged 3.8-liter V-6.\nHorsepower: 240 at 5,200 rpm.\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\nWeight: 3,722 pounds.\n0 to 60 mph: 7.1 seconds.\nSafety: Dual front air bags, antilock brakes, side-impact beams.\nMileage: 17-27 mpg.\nCompetition: Ford Thunderbird, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, BMW 328is, Lincoln Mark VIII, Lexus SC300.",

      "expert_review": "Leftovers anyone?\n\nToday’s menu features an entree from Buick: the ’92 Riviera luxury coupe.\n\nWith its curvaceous rear flanks, smart chrome grille and nicely styled taillights, the Riviera looks spicy.\n\nIn this case, however, appearances are deceiving.\n\nIt turns out that the Riviera is not only mild but a bit stale, too.\n\nThe 1980s probably will not be remembered as a decade loaded with blockbuster automotive designs. In fact, there are few 1980s cars likely to become classics. But the current model Riviera may one day reach that status based solely on its classy styling.\n\nThisbody style Riviera was born in 1986, and though it never really caught on with buyers, the elegant-looking coupe has helped enhance Buick’s image as an automaker that designs cars with character.\n\nBut time has caught up with the Riviera.\n\nThis version of the car should have been closed out with the 1980s.\n\nMechanically, the Riviera feels dated when compared with many other front-wheel-drive GM cars. Its interior also seems to lag far behind the times.\n\nHowever, if you prefer form over function and finesse, you are going to have a tough time finding a better-looking American-made luxury coupe priced in the mid-$20,000s.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nAll Rivieras are built with GM’s best V-6, the durable and economical 3.8 liter (231 cubic inch) engine. A computer-controlled four-speed automaticis the only gearbox available.\n\nFor some reason, the 3.8-liter and automatic transmission didn’t feel smooth and refined in the Riviera. I recently tested a 1993 Pontiac Bonneville SLE with the same drivetrain and felt it offered smoothness and performance on par with Acura and BMW.\n\nThe lack of refinement I detected in the Riviera probably is not a function of the drivetrain. It may be that its body and chassis are outdated. The Bonneville is a modern car designed and engineered with the latest technology. The Riviera is not. Therefore, when you accelerate in the Riviera you can hear and feel the engine a little more than you’d like in a luxury coupe. Through the steering wheel you feel a slight tugging (called torque steer) as power is transmitted to the front wheels.\n\nThis is a trait of many front-wheel cars of the 1980s. Engineers, for the most part, have learned to eliminate the problem.\n\nOn the plus side, the Riviera turned in a stellar performance at the gas pump.\n\nNot many 3,500-pound, five-passenger luxury coupes can give you 28 mpg on the highway and 24 in the city. That’s the fuel economy the Riviera delivered in my one-week, 450-mile test.\n\nHANDLING\n\nAs long as you don’t push the Riviera too hard, you’ll steer clear of trouble.\n\nThe car is very satisfying to drive on long stretches of smooth pavement and through easy, gentle curves.\n\nBut take it on a roughly paved road and you’ll hear a muted roar from the tires that seems to be telegraphed straight to the interior.\n\nTry t o hustle around a curve quickly and you’ll find the Riviera will comply, but not easily. It doesn’t have a taut, athletic feel – it rides like a luxury car. Perhaps that’s well-suited to the Riviera’s mission. The car appeals to an older buyer.\n\nThe power-assisted rack and pinion steering feels somewhat dull. And you can forget about any sharp turns. The steering radius is a wide 39.4 feet.\n\nHowever, the four-wheel power-assisted anti-lock brakes are excellent.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe test car came with a soft, comfortable set of red leather bucket seats and a floor-mounted shifter housed in a console.\n\nI found the seats, which are electrically adjustable, to be comfortable after a two-hour drive. The dash featured an analog speedometer and tachometer that were a bit small.\n\nThe dash is where the Riv really shows its age. It is a hulking chunk of plastic that dominates the interior to the point that it could make the driver feel claustrophobic.\n\nTh automatic air-conditioning system is typical GM: excellent. So was the stereo system, which contained a CD player.\n\nAside from some loose trim around the shifter, the test car seemed to be built well.\n\nAverage-size passengers are likely to be fairly comfortable in the rear seat. There’s ample headroom and legroom, and the seat is as inviting as a soft leather sofa.\n\nAll in all, the Riviera is a decent car. Next year, Buick is rumored to be bringing out a new version.\n\nBut the current model is likely to be remembered as one of the best cars of the 1980s.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Buick Riviera is one of the nicest looking cars of the 1980s. But the 1993 model year is under way, and this car feels old.",

      "expert_review": "Buick Motor Division has gotten a lot of mileage out of that Mediterranean vacation spa known as the Riviera.\n\nIt has been a premium luxury coupe ever since its introduction 32 model years ago. And there’s nothing about the completely redesigned 1995 Riviera to change that.\n\nThe new 2-door is one of those vehicles designed for a multitude of tastes, with something for everybody. Neither a rocket ship nor sedate transportation for the senior set, the Riviera offers speed and handling wrapped in comfort and convenience.\n\nIt follows the bigger is better theory, being almost 9 inches longer and 2 inches wider than the Riviera it replaces.\n\nIt’s also far more aerodynamic, with striking elliptical body forms highlighted by a series of curving surfaces.\n\nIn the Riviera that General Motors Corp.’s Terri Phillips provided for a test drive, this aerodynamic form held wind noise to just above a whisper at speed.\n\nSince the beginning, Rivieras have had all the toys, and the 1995 model is no exception. All major driver assists are standard, with some extras available in a prestige option package.\n\nIncluded in the test car’s prestige package were traction control, automatic mirror controls, wheel-mounted stereo radio controls and the like.\n\nAn option that gave the car extra performance was the 3.8- liter (231 cubic inch) supercharged 3800 Series II V6. The package includes half-inch wider aluminum wheels and speed-rated Eagle GA tires.\n\nThe $1,100 package only adds 20 horsepower over the non-supercharged 3800 engine. However, it ups the torque some 45 foot-pounds, and when that comes on line when pulling away from a light, it makes you forget about the money.\n\nThe V6 is a proven power producer, as evidenced by its participation in the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race. But I still think that from an image standpoint, a Riviera ought to have a V8.\n\nThe transmission, of course, is a four-speed automatic that shifts with impressive smoothness. The only thing wrong with it is the shift points are set to low. The transmission shifts gears before the engine speed gets high enough to show some muscle.\n\nIf you really want to go, you shift the four-speeder manually. That will put 0-60 mph into the seven-seconds bracket. Letting the computer do it lands you in the eights. Still, that’s better than the standard V6, which takes just a tick under 10 seconds.\n\nThe Riviera’s other performance characteristics tend to fall under the heading of a continental tourer rather than a sports coupe.\n\nThe ride was great and the road manners quite predictable. It’s an excellent example that you really don’t need a rally suspension unless you want to emulate Formula I types through the hairpins.\n\nIn traffic, the car was highly maneuverable. Thanks to a speed- sensitive power-steering system, it took only minute movements to change lanes. And to pass, just punch the throttle and you’re gone.\n\nUnlike the lag associated with a turbocharger, the Riviera’s positive displacement Roots -type supercharger gave instant throttle response.\n\nThe interior of the coupe is designed more for fine motoring than high performance.\n\nThe decor was on the elitist side. And the wide, front individual seats and spacious leg and head room mean you could ride all day with minimum fatigue.\n\nAccess to the rear seats wasn’t as convenient as with a four- door.\n\nThe 1995 Riviera is more than the equivalent of Rivieras of the past. I’d say it’s better, and probably will be better still the day they put a V8 in it.\n\n1995 Buick Riviera Base price: $27,632. As tested: $31,743.Type: Front-engine, front-drive, five-passenger, luxury coupe.Engine: 3.8 liters, supercharged OHV V6, 12 valves, 225 horsepower, 275 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Mileage: 17 mpg city, 27 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 8.2 seconds.Wheelbase: 113.8 inches.Length: 207.2 inches.Width: 75.0 inches.Height: 55.2 inche s.Curb w eight: 3,610 pounds.Options: Radio with stereo, compact disc player, supercharged 3800 V6, prestige option package, leather with operating console, heated driver’s seat with memory positions, memory mirrors.",

The industry beliefis that empty-nesters and aging Boomers are lined up outside dealershipswaiting for coupes, that empty-nesters and Boomers travel alone and not withother couples and that empty-nesters and Boomers don’t have grandkids they’dlike to slip in the back seat.

      "expert_review": "Maybe it’s because I grew up with big cars, road-faring dinosaurs that sucked up the fossil fuel of their four-footed relations, but I’ve always had a soft spot for large Detroit iron and soggy suspensions.\n\nFun to drive? Only if your idea of fun is trying to parallel park a car the size of Texas into a spot meant for Rhode Island. Then there’s the challenge of the “how many gas stations can I pass by before I have to stop?” game.\n\nBut it’s the uninhibited American-sized brash, but confident, nature of these beasts that I adore. It’s the same feeling that most of today’s car-buyers find in trucks, but won’t admit it. And the descendents of these Detroit sea-vessels get much better mileage than any tree-tromping sport ute.\n\nSo, it’s with more than a twinge of sadness that it’s time to bid farewell to another long-lived nameplate.\n\nThe last few years have not been kind to old names. Chrysler axed the LeBaron and the New Yorker; Ford axed the Thunderbird and GM has axed the Tornado, 98, Skylark and will soon end production on the 88 and Riviera.\n\nIt’s sad to see the Riv set sail, for it was a stylish coupe for most of its life. The name harks back to 1949 and the Roadmaster Riviera hardtop. Although Buick trotted out the name throughout the ’50s, it wasn’t until 1963 that it became a distinct model line.\n\nIn an age where every vehicle name represents either some rugged place the vehicle will never go or some marketer’s misconception of the English language, it’s almost quaint to remember that automakers used to name their cars to give it a clear image. In this case, it’s a French vacation spot where the local countrymen would never drive a crass American car.\n\nThe first Riviera was one of the ’60s finest moments style-wise, and one of GM styling-boss Bill Mitchell’s finest designs. It had clean, knife-edge styling and perfect proportions that were widely lauded and still look timelessly modern today. If the second generation wasn’t as highly praised as the first, the third generation boat-tail Rivs debuted to decidedly mixed reviews. I always liked looking at these boat-tailed Rivs, as long as I didn’t have to drive one.\n\nIt was downhill from there, only to be rescued in 1979, when the model was switched to the chassis it shared with the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Tornado. That meant front-wheel-drive and a popular body style that even yielded a stunning — albeit it rare –convertible. Buick downsized the car for 1986 and saw sales sink accordingly.\n\nIn 1995 the Rivera once again became a style leader for the rest of the Buick line with its swooping belt-line and pinched round grille — a hallmark of Buicks since the Park Avenue and Regal/Century.\n\nWhile the first Riviera used a 401 cubic-inch engine that pumped out a healthy 325-horsepower, the current iteration uses the tried-and-true supercharged 3.8-liter V-6, good for 240 horsepower fed through the front, rather than rear, wheels.\n\nStabbing the th rottle brings the beast to life and quite quickly one can propel this massive Buick down the road. The steering is light, so is brake effort. But this is a Buick in the classic sense.\n\nBut it has traction control and anti-lock brakes. Dual airbags and automatic headlamps come standard. There’s even a CD player, CD storage and even heated seats. The chassis is ultra stiff, giving the car a measure of handling one wouldn’t expect. It’s no sports sedan, but it will tackle corners without plastering passengers against the door.\n\nIt’s just that its mission is classic Detroit. And it’s big, really big.\n\nSinking into the front bucket seats make you feel insignificant in this machine with its large doors, swooping rear window and large trunk. The wide flat dash, pock-marked with round gauges that recall a ’60s design are spread out in front of the driver.\n\nThe seats are soft and wide. The ride is soft, the car is wide. It made me feel as if my body should b e soft and wide to drive the thing. But gobbling up interstate highway is its mission. And it’s about to set sail for the last time.\n\nIt would be easy to say that no one wants cars like this, but that isn’t true. The Riviera was finding buyers, despite the lack of marketing and, according to Automotive News, the line it was built on was profitable. But building three cars an hour won’t win prizes with efficiency experts. So like the Reatta before it, GM seems only too willing to kill a decent car.\n\nFor its final drive, Buick will produce 2,000 1999 Rivieras to join the one million Rivieras produced since 1963. The final 200 will be named Riviera Silver Arrows, with any color, as long as you like silver.\n\nAnd then, who knows. Buick may use the name in the future. According to press reports, currently on the drawing board is a vehicle similar to the Buick Signia show car that drives like a car with minivan-like space. Further down the line is a car equipped with satellite navigation and on-board internet access.\n\nBut sheet metal sells cars. And Buick needs sizzle. Where it used to sell over a million cars in 1985, it now sells less than 450,000. While cars like the Regal and Century are just what Buick needs, so are cars that buyers can feel passionate about.\n\nIs cutting the Riviera the answer?",
