      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nBuick has already proven itself adept at luxury on a large scale with the three-row Enclave SUV, and now the brand plans to foray into the compact luxury SUV market with its new Envision. Already on sale in China, the Envision will slot below the Enclave and above the tiny Encore in the automaker’s lineup.\nExterior\nOutside, the Envision is instantly recognizable as a member of the Buick family with the brand’s signature grille front and center flanked by upswept, winged headlights. Plenty of chrome trim makes the elegant face pop, and chiseled body lines add some drama to its profile.\nInterior\nBuick said it put the focus on soft-touch surfaces in the Envision for a premium look and feel. One unique feature is the large center console storage bin’s dual-wing doors. Buick says they provide easier, less-obstructed access for the driver as well as front and rear passengers.\n\nThe focal point of the cabin is a floating instrument panel that houses the standard IntelliLink multimedia system’s 8-inch touch-screen; it features a built-in Wi-Fi hot spot with 4G LTE connectivity. Four USB ports, four 12-volt outlets and a 120-volt outlet are also standard.\n\nOther standard luxury creature comforts include heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, eight-way power-adjustable front seats with four-way power adjustable lumbar, tri-zone climate control with rear-seat controls and a Bose premium sound system. Options include a panoramic moonroof and cooled front seats.\n\nIn back, there’s seating for three passengers on sliding, 60/40-split seats. Buick didn’t release specs but said the Envision offers more passenger and cargo room than the Acura RDX and Lincoln MKC.\nUnder the Hood\nPower comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 252 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. It uses an automatic stop/start feature to save fuel, though EPA estimates have not been released. The Envision is the first application of the stop/start system on this engine. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, as is all-wheel drive. Buick says its active twin clutch all-wheel-drive system is an automatic, on-demand system that delivers sure-footed handling in low-grip conditions and provides minimal torque to the rear wheels when all-wheel-drive traction isn’t required.\nSafety\nStandard safety features include lane keep assist, front park assist, lane change alert, rear cross-traffic alert, a rearview camera and the Safety Alert Seat, which pulses to alert the driver about a possible crash. Available features include full-speed range adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation braking, automatic park assist and a surround-vision camera system.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Buick Envision?\n\nThe Buick Envision is a compact SUV with seating for five. Under the hood is a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional. Rivals include the Acura RDX, Cadillac XT4, BMW X3, Genesis GV70, Lexus NX and Lincoln Corsair. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Buick Envision?\n\nThe Envision gets an exterior styling refresh that brings its looks in line with Buick’s other SUVs. Inside, the dashboard gets a dramatic 30-inch screen that encompasses a digital instrument display and infotainment touchscreen. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Buick Envision Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n30-inch digital instrument and infotainment display\nLED headlights\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Bose stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHands-free power liftgate\nMoonroof\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 Buick Envision?\n\nThe 2024 Buick Envision looks a lot sportier than before, and the cabin’s high-tech dashboard design is another commendable update for this model year. Acceleration is fine for daily driving, but the turbo four-cylinder lacks the grunt found in a number of rivals. To its credit, the Envision is priced thousands less than competing models from Audi, BMW, Genesis and Mercedes-Benz. If you’re looking for an easygoing luxury SUV at a more mainstream price, the Envision is worth your consideration.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Buick Envision?\n\nThe Buick Envision is a compact SUV with seating for five. Under the hood is a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional. Rivals include the Acura RDX, Cadillac XT4, Lexus NX and Lincoln Corsair. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Buick Envision?\n\nRemote start and additional safety features are now standard on all Envision trims for 2025. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Buick Envision Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n30-inch digital instrument and infotainment display\nLED headlights\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Bose stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system \nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHands-free power liftgate\nMoonroof\nWireless device charging\nHead-up display\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 Buick Envision?\n\nThe exterior styling refresh and high-tech dashboard design the Buick Envision received last year added to its appeal. Acceleration is fine for daily driving, but the turbo four-cylinder lacks the grunt found in a number of rivals. To its credit, the Envision is priced thousands less than competing models from Audi, BMW, Genesis and Mercedes-Benz. If you’re looking for an easygoing luxury SUV at a more mainstream price, the Envision is worth your consideration.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2021 Buick Envision premium compact SUV is stylish and refined, and has easy-to-use tech features, but poor brake-pedal feel degrades the driving experience.  \n\nVersus the competition: Sized like a compact SUV but priced below subcompact luxury models, the 2021 Envision gives shoppers who aren’t concerned with having a traditional luxury badge a lot of value for their money. \n\nThe 2021 Buick Envision newly shares its platform with the Cadillac XT4 compact luxury SUV, and it’s wider, lower and slightly shorter than the model it replaces. Despite the redesign, it remains one of the few vehicles sold in the U.S. that’s built in China.\n\nRelated: Power, Trim Details Emerge for 2021 Buick Envision\n\nThe 2021 Envision is also less expensive than its predecessor; a base Preferred trim level with front-wheel drive starts at $32,995 (including a $1,195 destination charge), which is $1,700 less than the starting price of the 2020 Envision. Our test vehicle was a mid-level Essence trim with front-wheel drive, and its as-tested price of $41,315 included a $2,500 Technology Package and a $1,325 Sport Touring Package, the latter featuring black exterior accents and 20-inch aluminum wheels. All-wheel drive is available on any trim for an extra $1,800. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nAll Envisions are powered by a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a standard nine-speed automatic transmission. The engine is smooth, refined and delivers adequate acceleration, and it produces a bit of a growl when you really step on the gas pedal. With nine forward gears, the automatic makes frequent upshifts when accelerating from a stop. The shifts are smooth, but there’s a short pause between gear changes. Part- and full-throttle kickdowns, however, happen without delay.\n\nThe SUV steers with a light touch, and the suspension deals swiftly with impacts from broken pavement. Body motions are well controlled overall, but the suspension tuning is on the firm side. This was especially noticeable on one stretch of road with small buckles in the asphalt, one after the other, that resulted in a choppy ride. Our test vehicle’s 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires likely didn’t help matters, and it’s possible the standard 18-inch wheels with taller-sidewall tires offer more comfort. Ditto for the top Avenir trim level’s available adaptive suspension, though experience has revealed that advanced suspensions don’t always compensate for large wheels.\n\nThe Envision’s brake-pedal feel was disappointing on a number of fronts. Pedal feel is numb, and it suffers from poor linearity on top of that. We’ve experienced this unpleasant combination in certain gas-electric hybrids, but it’s less common in conventionally powered vehicles like the Envision. Like many hybrids and a growing number of conventional vehicles, however, the Envision has a brake-by-wire system with electric assist rather than traditional vacuum-assisted power brakes. (We reported similarly disappointing braking feel in our review of the XT4, the Envision’s platform mate.)\n\nThe front-drive Envision is EPA-rated at 24/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined, while all-wheel-drive versions are rated 22/29/25 mpg. More powerful compact luxury SUVs like the Acura RDX and Lincoln Corsair get slightly worse estimated gas mileage, but the smaller BMW X1 has slightly better ratings (see fuel economy estimates for front- and all-wheel-drive versions of these SUVs). \n\nThe Interior\n\nInterior quality is good overall with soft-touch surfaces closer to eye level and hard plastic near your feet. Our test vehicle’s all-black color scheme, however, looked a bit dour to my eyes. A beige interior is also offered.\n\nFrequently used controls are within easy reach of the driver, and the center of the dash is dominated by the optional 10.2-inch touchscreen (an 8-inch touchscreen is standard in the Preferred trim). The big screen is responsive, has an intuitive interface and looks great. There are also handy volume and tuning knobs to the left of the screen. \n\nBoth touchscreen systems include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, but only the Avenir trim includes wireless device charging. Connecting my iPhone to the multimedia system was easy, and the wireless CarPlay connection seemed just as responsive as the more common wired setup.\n\nOne of the more unique elements of the interior is the gear selector, which consists of a column of buttons and pull switches that go where a conventional shifter channel otherwise would. It didn’t take long to get accustomed to the system, but the design doesn’t result in any additional storage space on top of the front center console; there’s a small forward bin, two cupholders to the right of the shifter and a storage bin under the front center armrest. The design does, however, eliminate the obstruction a lever would represent, and its electronic nature allows for an open lower storage area below the console. \n\nThe Envision’s front bucket seats are comfortable, and they’re finished in cloth and simulated leather (Preferred) or perforated real leather (Essence and Avenir). The seats have modest side bolsters that don’t hold you in place when taking a corner quickly, however. \n\nThere’s surprisingly good rear-seat space for adult passengers. The bench seat is comfortable and there’s good headroom. The standard 60/40-split backrest folds flat with the cargo floor, extending the luggage area, but the seatback doesn’t recline. \n\nSafety\n\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had crash-tested the 2021 Buick Envision as of publication. The list of standard active-safety features includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist and automatic high-beam headlights. A head-up display, 360-degree camera system and adaptive cruise control are optional. \n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Envision doesn’t fit neatly into the mainstream or luxury compact SUV classes, but to hear Buick tell it, that’s an opportunity. Rob Peterson, the brand’s marketing manager, said Buick serves shoppers moving up from mainstream brands and has both the Envision and the smaller and less expensive Encore GX to offer small SUV shoppers.\n\nThere are still some mainstream elements like cloth upholstery and manual air conditioning in base Envisions, but the mid-level Essence trim swaps them and more for upscale amenities without significantly ballooning the price tag. It’s a value recipe that seems right for the times. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Compact SUVs are, to borrow a phrase from the “Zoolander” movie, so hot right now, and Buick is looking to capitalize with a refreshed 2019 Envision, a vehicle first sold in the U.S. as a 2016 model. The updates are modest, offering some slight drivability and styling changes. I road-tested a loaded 2019 Envision Premium II, but first let’s take a look at what’s changed.\n\nRelated: Our View: 2017 Buick Envision\n\nWhat’s New\n\nUp front, there are new headlight clusters incorporating updated headlights across the trim levels: bi-xenon headlights on 2.5L models and LED headlights with the optional turbo engine. Buick also changed the grille and fascia, including different foglight housings. The rear also gets updated styling, including new squared-off dual exhaust ports. The styling differences on both sides are rather minor, and the dimensions and overall shape are untouched.\n\nUnder the hood, the base powertrain is also untouched, a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 197 horsepower and 192 pounds-feet of torque mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all trim levels up to the Premium and Premium II, on which the 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder takes over, mated to standard all-wheel drive. Though the engine’s horsepower rating is the same as in the 2018, a new nine-speed automatic transmission that Buick says can handle extra torque allowed engineers to retune the engine for 295 pounds-feet of torque rather than the previous 260 pounds-feet.\n\nThere’s one final mechanical addition for 2019: an auto stop-start switch in the interior, marking the first Buick to have one. The function isn’t new, but the ability to disable it is.\n\nThe change that most piqued my interest was a drop in price. Each trim level of the Envision sees a price reduction, listed in parentheses (prices include destination charges):\n\nEnvision: $32,990 ($2,000)\nPreferred: $34,495 ($2,370)\nEssence: $36,795 ($1,920)\nPremium: $41,695 ($1,620)\nPremium II: $44,595 ($1,360)\n\nThe as-tested price on the 2019 Envision Premium II that I drove was $48,030 after the addition of a panoramic moonroof and a Driver Confidence Package, which included adaptive cruise control, forward automatic emergency braking and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI drove a 2018 Envision for a week last year with the turbocharged powertrain and all-wheel drive, and felt the powertrain was a highlight. Buick says that with the added torque and new transmission, the zero-60-mph time for the Envision is cut down by almost half a second. Did it really feel more powerful? Not really, but that’s fine. I thought the powertrain in last year’s model was the highlight, and that continues. The Envision accelerates quickly and the accelerator is pretty responsive even without the assistance of different selectable drive modes.\n\nThe addition of a stop-start defeat button will please folks who don’t like those systems, but I found the Envision’s system to be rather seamless, with no jarring starting noises or hesitation when you get going again — to be honest, I forgot it was there (which is the goal), so I ended up leaving it on pretty much the entire time.\n\nOur review of the 2017 Envision highlighted its ride quality and comfort, and those areas remain positives as well on the updated vehicle. The pliant suspension continues to make ride quality a highlight, and its smoothness also helps to keep the interior quiet, which driver and passengers alike can appreciate. When the road gets twistier the Envision is less settled, with a fair amount of body roll anytime you take a corner with pace. It will never be considered a sporty SUV, but if that’s the trade-off for the added comfort, I think that’s a compromise Buick is happy to make.\n\nInterior Highs and Lows\n\nThe interior has not really changed. There were no discernible updates to the multimedia system or cabin materials. The backseat continues to be a plus, with an excess of both headroom and legroom, so those who sit back there will be comfortable on longer trips.\n\nI’m still not a fan of the Envision’s climate controls, which are a mix of physical buttons and touch-sensitive controls. The touch controls that change the temperature and activate the seat heating and ventilation are slow to respond — so slow that it can be hard to tell if you touched the right spot or not. A dial or physical button would be a better solution here.\n\nSafety Not Standard\n\nEven though I was testing the 2019 Envision’s most expensive trim level, forward automatic braking didn’t come standard, and that’s alarming on a car that costs nearly $45,000. Buick does offer forward collision warning, lane keep assist and blind spot warnings as standard on both Premium trims, but the automatic braking is the feature you want to help prevent crashes. What’s worse is that in the 2018 model, the Driver Confidence Package is offered only on the top trim level, which means that if you want these safety features on an Envision, you’ll have to pony up for the most expensive version.\n\nAgainst the Competition\n\nThe Envision isn’t left wanting for competitors, as the popularity of this class would suggest. Like-priced options include the Acura RDX and Lincoln MKC, and I’d even throw a luxurious mainstream competitor like the Nissan Murano into the mix. Both the RDX (full redesign) and MKC (refresh) get updates for 2019 as well, and while we don’t have pricing for those models yet, the 2018 versions started at more than the 2019 Envision: $36,995 for the RDX and $34,280 for the MKC.\n\nExterior dimensions for the 2019 Envision are within a few inches of those two vehicles on all sides, and the same goes for the interior where the three vehicles share similar cargo and passenger room. The 2018 Murano however, presents a different kind of competition: It’s a mid-size crossover, so there’s added size inside and out (it’s about 9 inches longer and has just over 5 extra cubic feet of cargo room), and it starts at $1,215 less.\n\nMore of the Same\n\nThe refreshed Envision reminded me a lot of the old Envision, and that’s OK (especially because it’s a little cheaper now).  The updates don’t move the needle, but it was in a comfortable spot for Buick already. In the three years since its introduction, the Envision has grown to become the third-highest-selling model in the Buick lineup as of the end of 2017, and it’s had a 73 percent increase in sales over the second half of its life.\n\nThe previous Envision had found its lane as a solid premium offering with a good powertrain (the turbocharged one at least), plenty of room for occupants and a quiet, comfortable interior that has impressive isolation. The 2019 edition doesn’t mess with that formula and should continue to yield positive results for Buick, especially with its aggressive pricing updates that lead it to further undercut its main competition.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Buick Envision competes with crossover SUV’s like the the Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and Lincoln MKC (see them compared).\n\n$$Image- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$$\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Buick Envision doesn’t break any new ground in the styling department. It’s got a conventional SUV/crossover body shape that’s more rounded and soft than the angular features of the RDX. There are holes in the hood that echo past Buick models, as well as a grille with a very large Buick badge.\n\nIt’s a good thing those styling features were there, though, because in a crowded parking lot it would have been otherwise hard to find the Envision. If blending into the background is your thing, the Envision is right up your alley.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIts ride is the Buick Envision’s best feature. It’s comfortable. It was never designed to be sporty, and that shows, with a luxury-class ride that’s good over rough roads and potholes. At the same time, it doesn’t feel too soft at highway speeds. That’s a tough thing to get right, and Buick nailed it with the Envision.\n\nThe rest of the driving isn’t as great. There’s a mushy brake pedal and acceleration that is, at best, on par with the rest of the class. Overall, the RDX is the most agile of the comparison group, with the Q5 somewhat behind in terms of driving enjoyment. The MKC and Envision are at the other, cushier end of the spectrum.\n\nThere’s a few available GMC drivetrains, and your choice affects mileage. We tested a Buick Envision Essence front-wheel-drive (FWD) model with a 197-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that got an EPA-estimated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined. That same engine is available with all-wheel drive (AWD), which earns a 21/28/24 mpg rating. AWD can also be had with a 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s rated 20/26/22 mpg.\n\n$$Image- 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20$$\n\nInterior\n\nThe Buick Envision’s materials and overall build quality are good, but at this price and against its competitors, there’s really no excuse for it not to be. The available wood trim and leather-appointed surfaces all look good and the panel gaps are consistent. Overall, it looks like time and care went into building the Envision, but a few generic/holdover GM switches in a few key places dampen the mood. In a luxury car, the last thing you want to think is, “I believe I’ve seen those climate controls on a non-luxury brand I drove recently… .”\n\nThe Q5 has the best interior of the group both in terms of materials and in terms of quality. While all the Envision’s switches and buttons feel substantial and nice, I can’t rank it significantly better than the rest of the group.\n\nSetting that aside, the Envision is roomy both front seats and back. For such a small SUV, backseat room in particular is quite good.\n\nHowever, I personally could not find a comfortable driving position in the FWD Envision. The steering wheel does telescope, but it didn’t telescope close enough for my needs. So I could either sit close enough to the wheel and have my legs crammed in tight, or have my legs comfortable but feel like I was reaching too far with my arms.\n\nIt also didn’t help that I didn’t find the seats supportive at all. I always felt like I was sitting on top of them as if I were sitting on a board rather than something sculpted, like a car seat usually is.\n\nFinally, outward visibility is good in all directions. That’s surprising because the windshield pillars rake back toward the driver at a shallow angle, yet it was never hard for me to see out the Envision, either when parking or while driving on the highway.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the Envision is built in China, making it the first China-built car from an American brand sold in the U.S. Despite my discomfort and the climate switches, overall it’s a good, but not spectacular, effort.\n\n$$Image- 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26$$\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThis is one area where the front-wheel Buick Envision stands head and shoulders above the competition. It’s not that the controls are revolutionary, they just do what they do very well. They make your life easier.\n\nAn easy example is the powered rear hatch on our test model. It’s got a height adjustment, as many do, but unlike others that bury that adjustment in a submenu on the multimedia screen, this one is a simple knob you turn. It’s a small thing, but it makes that small thing so much easier to do, you might actually use it.\n\nIt’s the same for the multimedia system. Our test model came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but the standard GM system for switching from radio to a different audio input and so forth worked well.\n\nThe only odd thing — though it was something I liked — was the touch-sensitive adjustment for both the interior temperature and the heated seats. It seemed out-of-place considering the amount of physical buttons throughout the cabin, but it was easy and intuitive to use, so it was fine for me.\n\n$$Image- 27, 28$$\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Buick Envision is a compact SUV, and you’ll be reminded of that when you see the cargo area. I used the Envision for a camping trip and found it to be tighter than comparable SUVs I’ve tested lately. If you’re the sort of person who’s a heavy packer and/or usually carries people in the backseat, you’ll want to look at the cargo area. Especially with the rear seats slid back to offer the most legroom, the cargo area is tight.\n\nThe rest of the cabin is OK but not great. There’s a medium-sized center console, but that’s it for interior storage. It was large enough for my iPhone 6 and several other items, so the lack of other storage options wasn’t as problematic, but there certainly wasn’t a lot of room to spare.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Buick Envision received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick Plus rating for earning the highest rating of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, fair and poor) in all crashworthiness tests and a score of advanced (out of a possible not available, basic, advanced and superior) in front crash prevention with optional equipment.\n\nOur test vehicle didn’t include the available front crash prevention equipment but did include a backup camera, a rear cross-traffic alert system and blind spot monitoring.\n\n$$Image- 29$$\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe more I drove the Buick Envision the more I thought it was a worthy competitor to other small SUVs, such as the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and others in our 2016 Compact SUV Challenge. What’s bad for the Envision is that our test model cost roughly $8,000 more than those competitors — and even at that, I’m not convinced the Envision would win the Challenge. The Buick Envision is larger than it’s sister SUV, the Encore.\n\nConsider the Envision against comparably priced models — MDX, Q5 and MKC — and it starts to look worse for the Buick. While it does have a very good ride, it just can’t measure up to the interior quality of the Acura or Audi. The MKC and Envision are close, but in terms of materials and quality, I still give the edge to the Lincoln.\n\nIt’s a shame, because the Buick Envision is a comfortable little SUV. Buick just needs to figure out a way to bring the price down, or spruce up the interior, to make it competitive.",
