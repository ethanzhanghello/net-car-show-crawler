      "expert_review": "Just in time for $3-a-gallon gas: a small wagon from Jeep with decent fuel economy.\n\nIt’s the 2007 Compass, an all-new vehicle from Jeep, based on the design of the Dodge Caliber.\n\nWhile these two vehicles are nearly identical underneath, including the same drivetrain, the Compass actually looks like a Jeep, even though it’s not intended for serious off-road use.\n\nThis is a vehicle for people who like the looks of a Jeep, including the signature seven-slot grille, but who don’t intend to go rock-climbing or desert-running. Like the slightly larger Liberty, the Compass also is aimed at female buyers. There is a second new Jeep built on the same chassis as the Compass and Caliber that is intended for male consumers – the Patriot.\n\nIt has the more-traditional squared-off Jeep styling, quite similar to the Cherokee model that was discontinued after 2001, while the Compass has a more-rounded exterior that is supposed to be more appealing to women.\n\nBoth vehicles begin under $16,000 and come with the same drivetrains, and the Compass is available with all-wheel drive. But only the Patriot has a four-wheel-drive system that earns the vehicle Jeep’s “Trail Rated” designation. The all-wheel drive in the Compass is intended primarily for on-road driving, especially on snow, ice or wet pavement.\n\nWhy build a Jeep that can’t go off road? Some Jeep purists have posed that question, and the answer is simple: to grow the Jeep brand so owner Chrysler Group can make money on it. That’s important for off-road aficionados because it gives Chrysler financial justification to keep developing niche vehicles such as the venerable Wrangler.\n\nFor those who have no intention of going off-roading, but who want Jeeplike styling in an affordable package, the Compass is a good choice. I’m not convinced that the exterior styling is so feminine that men would be embarrassed to drive the Compass, either. It looks pretty good to me, and I have a Wrangler in my driveway. Chrysler predicts that about 60 percent of buyers will be women, and that the median age of the buyer will be 40, and that median household income will be $60,000 annually. Half of buyers are expected to be college graduates, and 55 percent will be married.\n\nAlthough it’s more like a small wagon, Jeep calls the Compass a “compact SUV.” That’s a market segment that is growing rapidly as gasoline prices continue to climb. Chrysler says compact SUV sales are expected to nearly double by 2010 from their 2005 sales of 368,000 units.\n\nThe Compass offers “the packaging and functionality of an SUV with the performance, handling, fuel economy and price of a compact car or small pickup,” Chrysler says.\n\nBase price is $15,425 plus $560 freight, which brings the two-wheel-drive Sport model with a five-speed manual gearbox. Our tester, though, was the Sport with a few upgrades, including the continuously variable automatic transmission, a $1,000 option.\n\nMost Compass sales will be of the automatic transmission model, which is EPA rated (using the 2007 formula) at 24 miles per gallon city and 27 highway. While there are cars that get better fuel economy, this is pretty good for a small crossover utility vehicle/wagon that can haul five adults (and their luggage) quite comfortably.\n\nUnder the hood of all Compass models is Chrysler’s new 2.4-liter, inline four-cylinder “world engine,” rated at 172 horsepower and 165 foot-pounds of torque. This is considerably more power than you would get with one of the new small hatchbacks/wagons on the market this year, such as the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa, Suzuki SX4 and Kia Rondo.\n\nThe Compass is roomier than all of those, as well.\n\nAnd even at the base price, there is a fairly long list of standard equipment, including some key safety features that are either optional or not offered on some less-expensive or smaller competitors. Those include side-curtain air bags, electronic stability control, traction control, electronic roll mitigation, four-wheel disc antilock brakes, and hydraulic brake assist.\n\nOther standard features include cloth seats, outdoor-temperature display, AM/FM single-disc CD radio with an auxiliary input jack for an iPod or other MP3 player, a vinyl load floor, a center console with sliding armrest, manual windows/door locks/mirrors, 60/40 split fold-flat rear seat, tilt steering column, theft-deterrent system, rear wiper/washer/defroster, fog lights, and 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAir conditioning is option, but was included on our test vehicle in a “customer preferred package” ($2,600), which also brought power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, a reclining rear seat, a height-adjustable driver’s seat, a 115-volt power outlet, a removable dome light/rechargeable flashlight, map/reading lights and passenger-assist handles.\n\nA “driver convenience group” ($425) tacked on a self-dimming rearview mirror, tire-pressure monitoring system, driver-information center, outdoor temperature/compass display, and a universal garage/gate opener.\n\nOur vehicle also came with the optional YES Essential cloth seats ($150), a patented fabric that resists stains – especially the kinds of stains that small children might inflict on regular cloth seats. Chrysler says it has tested this fabric with ketchup, mustard and even red wine, and all of these clean up easily without leaving stains. The low price of this upgrade makes it well worth the money.\n\nOther extras on our test vehicle included green metallic clearcoat exterior paint ($150), premium floor mats ($30), and Sirius satellite radio with one year of service ($195).\n\nWith all of the options, the sticker of our vehicle totaled $20,535, including freight. I’m not sure all of the extras are necessary. I could live with the base model plus just air conditioning, stain-resisting seats and automatic transmission. The air conditioning isn’t offered as a standalone option, however – it comes only in that $2,600 package.\n\nThose who don’t mind using a clutch and shifting manually can save the $1,000 cost of the automatic transmission – and get better fuel economy as well. Ratings for the manual model are 26 mpg city/30 highway.\n\nChrysler says the Compass is the first Jeep front-wheel-drive vehicle with a fully independent suspension, designed to help give the vehicle a smooth on-road ride. The optional four-wheel-drive system is called Freedom Drive I. It is a full-time system with a lockable center coupling. Four-wheel-drive models begin at $17,585 (including freight).\n\nOther available options include a sunroof, upgraded audio system with six-disc CD player and MP3 CD playback, cruise control, and a Boston Acoustics premium 458-watt sound system with two flip-down speakers in the tailgate.\n\nThe top-of-the-line Limited model ($20,140 for two-wheel drive; $21,740 with four-wheel drive) includes such premium features as leather seats, 18-inch aluminum wheels, driver lumbar support, and bright exterior trim. Options on the Limited include the automatic transmission, 18-inch chrome wheels, and a hands-free communications system.\n\nChrysler builds the Compass on the same assembly line with the Patriot and Caliber at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., which was completely renovated to accommodate these new vehicles.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2006 about the 4×4 version of the 2007 Jeep Compass. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nJeep is billing the Compass as a competitor for small SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. That’s a lofty comparison, and even though the Compass costs as much as those vehicles when given just a few options — like a continuously variable transmission and 4×4 — it is not a small SUV. Even with the Jeep name on the front, the Compass is clearly a car. Yes, you heard me, a car.\n\nIt might look like an SUV, but its dimensions, suspension, ride height and driving personality are all car. Why is this important? Two reasons: Consumers are being sold one thing and getting another, and when you make the right comparisons, the Compass doesn’t hold up to its real-car competition.\n\nWhile the Compass is adequate and in some regards above average, it isn’t going to set the world on fire. It’s a gamble by Chrysler, which is not in the best financial position right now. It’s interesting to note that when the Compass was given the green light — along with its more handsome sibling, the upcoming Jeep Patriot, and Dodge’s already released Caliber — Chrysler was awash in profits. Company execs were so giddy that instead of green-lighting one Jeep car/SUV to be built alongside the Caliber, they approved two. Now that decision is coming back to haunt them.\n\nExterior\nMost debate about the Compass will come from its exterior; no one will say it isn’t daring. My black test vehicle made the most of all the Compass’ jutting edges and odd exterior light placements. Around front — where cars used to have bumpers — an odd lower lip juts out. Black thankfully hides this design element, but other colors do not. This is where many people find fault with the look.\n\nOtherwise, the side glass that tapers off toward the rear of the Compass looks contemporary, as does the sporty spoiler above the rear liftgate. A tough stance adds Jeep authority from afar, but there isn’t much to back it up underneath.\n\nThe Inside\nChrysler can no longer get by on flashy exterior designs alone. Over the past few years, as good-looking vehicles like the Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled out, everyone overlooked their relatively bulky and, let’s just say it, cheap plastic interiors. In this $15,995 Compass, the interior is even more plasticky.\n\nHere’s where that Jeep nameplate helps out; because Jeep, unlike Dodge, is known as an offroad brand, there are rugged cues that make the plastic less offensive than in the more street-oriented Caliber. Meaning, if a car looks like it’s going to get muddy, you don’t want it to look too nice.\n\nThere are also convenient cubbies and cupholders in all the right places. There’s even a slot above the glove box that’s perfect for a run to the post office.\n\nMy tester’s cloth seats were supportive and felt good to the touch, as did the roof lining. The steering wheel also felt great; it was made of soft plastic and was just the right size for any driver. An oversized shift lever was kind of bulky, but it didn’t impair drivability. The gauges — with little cardinal points to play up the Compass name — were pretty cool and looked more expensive than the rest of the interior.\n\nThat said, I just couldn’t get over the rough seams where one plastic part met another. They can scratch the skin — they were that unfinished. When my wife got into the car for the first time she used the word “cheap” immediately. I told her it cost a lot less than her 2004 Grand Cherokee, though. About $10,000 less. She quickly changed her tune, saying, “It’s not that bad.”\n\nEven after a week, though, I’m sure I could only live with the Compass’ interior if I got a version of the car that was closer to the $15,985 base price and not the $21,185 tester price.\n\nRide & Handling\nBefore this review starts sounding like a bash fest, there is some good news. For an entry-level product, the Compass handles a lot better than it should. Steering feel is light without giving up any accuracy. You can zip through traffic and around corners just like you can in any sporty compact car.\n\nThere was a fair amount of road noise on the highway, which can be expected in the compact segment, but it wasn’t as noticeable as in the Dodge Caliber. Wind noise was light, and the ride over a torn-up highway of grooved pavement was much better than I imagined. An above-average driving feel like this is much harder to attain than a quality interior, so it’s a good thing Jeep got this right.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nWant a thrilling driving experience? This Jeep doesn’t have one, but that’s OK; you don’t need to peel out at traffic lights if you’re driving a Compass. What you need to know is that at highway speeds, the Compass doesn’t waver. With some heavy boxes in the back and my wife in the passenger seat I was doing more than 80 without noticing it on the highway (this one was well-paved).\n\nNow here’s where we have to talk about the CVT. The three-lettered transmission option might be a mystery to car buyers, but it shouldn’t be. Just think of it as an advanced automatic transmission that transitions between gears very smoothly — so smoothly that most people wind up missing the jolts a standard automatic delivers when shifting from one gear to the next. The CVT is also supposed to aid in fuel economy. I was very disappointed, though, with the 23/26 mpg city/highway of the Compass. Even with all-wheel drive, it barely contends with a much more outdated Subaru Impreza. It might compare to those compact SUVs we mentioned before, like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, but it doesn’t come close to compact hatchbacks like the Mazda3 and Toyota Matrix.\n\nThe 172-horsepower engine was pretty hum-drum and nowhere near as exciting as the same setup in the Caliber. It was driving at highway speeds that made me enjoy the Compass as a competent commuter, not the launches from stoplights.\n\nBraking wasn’t nearly as acceptable; during one real-life emergency braking maneuver there was significant shudder from the brakes that had me a bit tense. Brake feel in day-to-day driving, however, was solid.\n\nSafety\nFor an entry-level vehicle the Compass comes stacked with safety features. Side curtain airbags, traction control, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes all come standard at the $15,985 entry price.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety just released crash-test results for the Compass’ sibling, the Dodge Caliber. It received a Good rating, the best possible, in the frontal crash test, but got a Marginal score, the second worst possible, in both side-impact and rear-impact tests. While the two vehicles aren’t identical, the results should be similar for the Compass.\n\nCargo\nThe Compass boasts a hard-floor cargo area as a plus. Personally I prefer carpet back there, mainly because my dog — a boxer — hates standing on the slick plastic when the back seats are flipped forward. Otherwise the cargo area size and height were ideal for her. The rear windows were right at her head level, and she could stick her face out the window all day long if she wanted.\n\nThe Compass is just adequate for cargo, and here’s where those comparisons to the CR-V and RAV4 fall apart. The Compass has 21.9 cubic feet of cargo room with the seats up and 52.5 with the seats folded. The RAV4 is significantly larger at 36.4 cubic feet and 73 cubic feet, respectively. The CR-V has 33.5 cubic feet and 72 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nThat’s why consumers should compare the Compass to other car-based hatchbacks, like the Mazda3 or Toyota Matrix; in this category the Compass easily bests them. If cargo is a major concern, the Compass has to be ruled out of a shopping comparison with small SUVs. But if you just want the utility, it’s better than most hatchbacks. Just go into the dealership in the right frame of mind.\n\nFeatures\nThere are a few spiffy features in the Compass. An optional Musicgate stereo system is also a must, not because the rear speakers flip outward when the tailgate is lifted, transforming the Compass into an impromptu boom box, but because the sound inside when the rear is closed is far superior to the stock system. It’s the one option I’d opt for.\n\nThere’s also a holder built into the armrest for iPods or other MP3 players. I found this awkward to use with my iTunes-enabled cell phone and not at all comfortable as an armrest while driving. Instead I just dropped the cell phone into a handy cubby below the shifter and left iTunes on shuffle. There it was out of sight and out of mind, and that wasn’t even the intended use.\n\nA standard rear dome light pops out of the roof lining for use as a flashlight. I honestly can’t remember the last time I needed a flashlight while looking around my trunk, and during the week of testing nothing came up that needed such illumination.\n\nCompass in the Market\nJeep is going to have a tough time selling the Compass. Sure it’s the least expensive vehicle on the lot, but it doesn’t deliver as an SUV, even a small one. Its price and just-average fuel economy keep it out of the compact car debate. In the end, it’s this weird limbo that makes it hard to justify the Compass to a real-world buyer. If someone wants economy and utility, they’ll stick with a Mazda3 or another hatchback. If they want an SUV for higher ride height and more cargo room, they’ll get a RAV4 or even the Jeep Liberty. Trying to be all things to all people, the Compass ends up not winning over any segment.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe Jeep Compass is a five-seat compact SUV that competes with rivals like the Ford Bronco Sport, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4. All Compass trims — of which there are eight — come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 200 horsepower and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard across the board. An available Trailhawk trim delivers exceptional off-road capabilities.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jeep Compass?\n\nAfter a refresh for the 2022 model year and a new turbo four-cylinder engine for 2023, the Compass is little changed for 2024. The front grille insert treatment has been updated, and new wheel designs are available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jeep Compass Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nThree USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nRear-seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n25-inch digital instrument display\nWireless device charging\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHands-free power liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHill descent control\nFront and rear tow hooks\nAmazon Alexa\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe 2024 Jeep Compass has a lot going for it, especially in terms of its intuitive infotainment system, all-terrain capability and lengthy roster of standard active-safety features. The problem is the Compass competes in the five-seat compact SUV arena, where it faces a wide range of competitors that excel when it comes to engine refinement, cargo space, steering agility and ride comfort. While few of its rivals can match the Compass when the road ahead is rocky or muddy, this Jeep gets pretty expensive when you start climbing to higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe Jeep Compass is a five-seat compact SUV that competes with rivals like the Ford Bronco Sport, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4. All Compass trims come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 200 horsepower and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard across the board. An available Trailhawk trim delivers exceptional off-road capabilities.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe Compass carries over mostly unchanged for 2025. A new limited-edition paint color called Joose will be available later in the model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Compass Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nThree USB ports\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nRear-seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\nWireless device charging\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHands-free power liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nHill descent control\nFront and rear tow hooks\nAmazon Alexa\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe 2025 Jeep Compass has a lot going for it, especially in terms of its intuitive infotainment system, all-terrain capability and lengthy roster of standard active safety features. The problem is the Compass competes in the five-seat compact SUV arena, where it faces a wide range of competitors that excel when it comes to engine refinement, cargo space, steering agility and ride comfort. While few of its rivals can match the Compass when the road ahead is rocky or muddy, this Jeep gets pretty expensive when you start climbing to higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuilt on a new car-based platform shared with the Dodge Caliber, the Compass is one of two front-wheel-drive models from Jeep — the other being the compact Patriot. Both cars are examples of why so-called crossover vehicles are supplanting traditional truck-based SUVs. Trim levels include the Sport and better-equipped Limited.\n\nJeep’s compact, car-based Compass lacks the offroad chops its larger siblings boast, but it can tread lightly off the beaten path thanks to optional all-wheel drive. Compass competitors include the Honda Element and Ford Escape.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Compass gets a redesigned instrument panel, door trim panels and center console. Jeep says there is a retuned suspension and improved sound deadening to provide a smoother and quieter ride. Option packages have also been simplified.\n\nExterior\nThe Compass looks like the child of the previous-generation Liberty and the current Grand Cherokee. The doors have matching moldings that dress up a deliberate accent groove. All models have black mirrors and door handles, not body-colored.\n\nThe Compass is 173.4 inches long and 71.3 inches wide; that’s about the same as the Escape, but the Element is shorter.\n\nStandard body-colored front and rear bumpers and grille (moldings on Limited models are also body-colored)\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard side roof rails\n17-inch aluminum wheels (Sport)\n18-inch aluminum wheels (Limited)\n18-inch chrome-clad wheels (optional on Sport)\nOptional sunroof\n\nInterior\nFor 2009, the Compass gets a revised interior. The dashboard gets an all-new instrument panel that’s smoother and features chrome accents that brighten the new round interior vents, shift bezel and cluster rings (on Limited editions). There are also all-new door trim panels, and the center console features padded armrests.\n\nInterior dimensions are rather large for the segment, coming in at 123.5 cubic feet of passenger volume, which beats the competitors by a good margin. Cargo volume, though, comes in at 22.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 53.6 cubic feet with the second-row bench folded. That’s less cargo volume than both the Escape and Element.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard illuminated cupholders\nAvailable cloth, stain-resistant cloth or leather upholstery\nOptional power locks, windows and mirrors (standard on Limited)\nOptional hands-free communication system\nOptional voice-activated navigation and/or audio system (including touch-screen, voice commands, 30GB hard drive and navigation radio)\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Compass and Patriot are Jeep’s first models with four-wheel-independent suspensions. The brand’s other SUVs retain a solid rear axle, which offers advantages in some offroad situations.\n\nFor 2009, the Compass gets improved floor and engine-compartment silencers and a revised exhaust resonator that Jeep says will provide a quieter ride. Revised suspension tuning on Sport models is designed to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride.\n\n172-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 165 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission\nFront- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\n\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with electronic roll mitigation\nStandard antilock braking system\nStandard traction control\nStandard smart key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt\nOptional seat-mounted side-impact airbags (front only)\nOptional alarm system",

Trim levels include the Sport and better-equipped Limited.\n\nJeep’s compact, car-based Compass lacks the off-road chops its larger siblings boast, but it can tread lightly off the beaten path thanks to optional four-wheel drive. Compass competitors include the Honda Element and Ford Escape.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no significant changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nThe Compass looks like the child of an older Liberty model and the current Grand Cherokee. The doors have matching moldings that dress up a deliberate accent groove. Body-colored door handles are available, in addition to standard black handles.\n\nStandard body-colored front and rear bumpers and grille\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard side roof rails\n17-inch aluminum wheels (Sport)\n18-inch aluminum wheels (Limited)\n18-inch aluminum chrome-clad wheels (optional on Limited)\nOptional sunroof\nOptional bright overlays for bumpers\n\nInterior\nFor 2010, interior changes are minor, with the Compass gaining optional automatic climate control. The interior features a 60/40-split folding rear seat, plus an optional power driver’s seat, optional fold-flat front passenger seat and optional power windows.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard illuminated cupholders\nAvailable cloth, stain-resistant cloth or leather upholstery\nOptional hands-free communication system\nOptional navigation\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Compass and Patriot are Jeep’s first models with four-wheel-independent suspensions. The brand’s other SUVs retain a solid rear axle, which offers advantages in some off-road situations.\n\nThe Compass has floor and engine-compartment silencers and an exhaust resonator that Jeep says will provide a quieter ride. Suspension tuning on Sport models is designed to provide a smoother, more comfortable ride.\n\n158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 141 pounds-feet of torque\n172-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 165 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission\nFront- or four-wheel drive\nOptional remote start\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard hill-start assistance with manual transmission\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with electronic roll mitigation\nStandard antilock braking system\nStandard traction control\nStandard Smart Key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt\nOptional seat-mounted side-impact airbags (front only)\nOptional alarm system",

      "expert_review": "There’s probably a good master’s thesis to be written for someone’s MBA on the Jeep marketing strategy – or lack of it. Obtaining the iconic brand, with a favorable worldwide reputation, was undeniably a central reason why Fiat bought into Chrysler.\n\nBut Jeep’s reputation has been diluted this past decade by opportunism. As recently as 2005, it could be argued that the Jeep brand was underrepresented in the market, with just three models — the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and Liberty. But within a few years, sensing opportunity in a tough market, Jeep overpopulated dealer lots, still offering the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and Liberty, plus the Compass, Patriot and Commander. And really, the four-door Wrangler Unlimited is different enough from the regular Wrangler that it could almost be considered the seventh model.\n\nThe big Commander didn’t survive, and several Jeep models aren’t selling that well, though the iconic Wranger and the all-new Grand Cherokee are as good as anything on the market. But one of the challenges for the brand has been the two entry-level models, the Compass and the Patriot. Certainly there’s an identity crisis there – the Compass and Patriot are very similar vehicles, both based on the same front-wheel-drive platform used by the useful but aging Dodge Caliber. In very early marketing clinics, Jeep claimed that men seemed to like the Patroit, women seemed to like the Compass. Rather than select one, Jeep decided to build both.\n\nOstensibly, the Patroit is the more macho of the two vehicles, but that’s sort of like trying to select the most macho member of the Glee cast. And now that the Compass has just been redesigned as a late-2011 model, the Patriot seems even more extraneous.\n\nWisely, Jeep designers patterned the new Compass after the Grand Cherokee, which provides a suitable sense of family. The exterior makes the Compass look like a smaller-scale Grand Cherokee, and upgrades to the interior definitely qualify as an improvement. The test Compass, a deluxe Limited model, was loaded with standard features ranging from heated seats and exterior mirrors to a removable, rechargable LED flashlight. The Compass also has plenty of safety features, including front and rear side-curtain airbags, stability control and active head restraints.\n\nThere were also quite a few options, including high-quality “Deep Cherry Red Crystal Pearl” paint ($225), a premium, 11-speaker audio package for $650, a $685 “media center” that included a DVD player, custom chromed aluminum wheels for $825, and a $750 package that added an alarm, remote starting, an alarm, Bluetooth, front seat-mounted side airbags and a few other, smaller features.With a $700 destination charge, the Limited’s $24,295 base price swelled to $28,130. Add a four-wheel-drive package to our front-drive test vehicle, and you could easily top $30,000, which is pretty optimistic on Jeep’s part.\n\nMechanically, the Compass isn’t that different from last year’s model. The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 158 horsepower, mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. But the majority of Compass models you are likely to see on dealer lots will have the same engine-transmission combination the test model has:An optional 2.4-liter, 172-horsepower four-cylinder, and a CVT, which stands for Continuously Variable Transmission. A CVT works like an automatic, but rather than use a set number of four, five or six gears, it has an infinite ratio and doesn’t really shift from one gear to the next.\n\nThe 2.4-liter engine isn’t as smooth-running as the best four-cylinders in this class, a characteristic not helped by the CVT. Power is certainly adequate, though, and EPA-rated mileage, 21 mpg city, 27 highway, is about what we’d expect.\n\nOn the road, the five-passenger Compass rides well, but the suspension seems surprised by medium- to large-sized potholes. Handling is average. Though Jeep says the Compass can be “trail-rated” with a four-wheel-drive off-road package, it’s no Wrangler, and tackling anything more ambitious than a cow trail or mildly muddy road might be taxing its ability.\n\nAs a capable, small-family SUV, though, the restyled Compass will do everything you ask, and the new exterior and interior add plenty of appeal. It may be a bit light on its feet to suit diehard Jeep fanatics, but they don’t represent the Compass’ mainstream target audience.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com.\n\n2011 Jeep Compass Limited\n\nBase price: $24,295\n\nPrice as tested: $28,130\n\nEPA rating: 21 miles per gallon city driving, 27 mpg highway.\n\nPowertrain: 2.4-liter, 172-horsepower four-cylinder engine with a continously variable automatic transmission.\n\nLength: 173.4 inches\n\nWheelbase: 103.7 inches\n\nParting shot: Competent sport-ute with improved styling that at least makes it look like a real Jeep.",

      "expert_review": "The new third-generation 2026 Jeep Compass debuted today with a choice of electrified powertrains — one hybrid, one plug-in hybrid and one full-electric — along with a massive elephant in the room: the U.S. tariff situation. It’s unclear whether the Compass will come to the U.S. given that retooling for its production in Canada was one of the first things to be put on hold after the Trump administration announced sweeping new tariffs that affect the auto industry.\n\nRelated: Affordable Cars Under $30,000 Face the Biggest Threat From Trump’s Tariffs\n\nIf it doesn’t become one of the first new vehicles pulled from the U.S. market due to tariffs, the new Compass looks like a rugged little runabout, with a roomier interior than the outgoing model, semi-autonomous driving capabilities and available four-wheel drive.\n\nWhat’s New for the Next-Gen 2026 Jeep Compass?\n\nThe biggest change coming to the new Compass are its three powertrain options with varying levels of electrification: a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and a full-electric. Buyers can choose from front- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThe hybrid powertrain includes a turbocharged three-cylinder 1.2-liter engine mated to a 48-volt hybrid system, per Automotive News, making a combined 145 horsepower (European horsepower figures are typically slightly higher than U.S. numbers). Moving to the 1.6-liter four-cylinder plug-in hybrid drivetrain ups output to 195 hp. Three all-electric versions offer between 213 hp in the entry-level, single-motor FWD version up to 375 hp with the most powerful 4WD version. That 375-hp 4WD Compass EV features a new, more powerful rear electric motor offering an extra 66 hp and 171 pounds-feet of torque, and Jeep claims it can climb a 20% grade without any traction on the front wheels. Additionally, a mid-level Compass noted by Automotive News offers 228 hp and FWD.\n\nThe new Compass EV is capable of 160-kilowatt DC fast charging, which isn’t as fast as many of its all-electric peers, but Jeep claims it can refill the SUV’s battery from 20% to 80% in 30 minutes. The entry-level 213-hp variant packs a 74-kilowatt-hour battery, while Automotive News reports that the two more powerful versions will have a larger 96-kWh battery.\n\nWe only have the European range figures for the Compass EV, but Jeep claims it’s capable of going up to 311 miles with both its entry-level 74-kWh version and its 4WD dual-motor version and up to 404 miles with the single-motor 96-kWh version. It’s worth noting that, as with output, the European test cycle tends to produce larger range figures than the U.S. EPA test cycle, so expect to see a slightly smaller figure if the Compass comes stateside even if the powertrains are unchanged. Jeep claims the new Compass’ improved aerodynamics help achieve that impressive range, with active grille shutters in the front bumper, air ducts on the wheels and a fully flat underbody.\n\nEven with the significant changes under the hood, the Compass remains unmistakably a Jeep on the outside, complete with a seven-slot grille, trapezoidal wheel arches and antiscratch tough-guy cladding to safeguard it from trail branches and shopping carts alike. Jeep boasts that its compact SUV will still be capable if you head off-pavement even in FWD guise with its 7.8-inch ride height and 18.5-inch fording depth. Selectable modes suited for different kinds of terrain come standard.\n\n4WD versions get more ground clearance, which in turn increases their approach, departure and breakover angles, and fording depths. These variants feature hill descent control as standard, as well.\n\nA More Spacious Interior With Plenty of Extras\n\nThe other big change is the embiggening of the interior, which Jeep says boasts an extra 2.2 inches of legroom in the rear seats along with a larger 1.2-cubic-foot storage compartment in the front and 1.6 extra cubic feet of space in the rear cargo area, bringing the total cargo space up to 19.4 cubic feet, per Jeep’s measurements. A 40/20/40-split, folding rear bench gives buyers several more options for fitting even larger items in the back. All of this comes in a package that’s still less than 15 feet long on the outside.\n\nThe new Compass includes a 10-inch digital gauge cluster and a 16-inch infotainment screen capable of receiving over-the-air updates, as well as a Level 2 semi-autonomous driving system, likely similar to the one offered on the Grand Cherokee and other upmarket Jeeps. A head-up display, LED matrix headlights and lane change assist are also available.\n\nWhat Trim Levels Are Available at Launch?\n\nAt least in Europe, the new Compass is being offered as the First Edition at launch, which comes with FWD only but offers a choice of either the 145-hp hybrid or 213-hp electric powertrain. It comes equipped with 20-inch wheels, a hands-free power liftgate, Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities, front and rear parking sensors, a rear parking camera and LED matrix headlights. Inside, it has a cloth-and-vinyl interior with six-way manually adjustable heated front seats and a two-way driver lumbar adjustment. Optional upgrades include ventilated and massaging seats, a moonroof and automated lane-changing capabilities.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Are Automakers Responding to Trump’s Tariffs?\nHow ‘American’ Are the Bestselling Vehicles Made in the U.S.?\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\nHow Trump’s 25% Tariffs on Automobiles, Automotive Parts Will Affect You\nIf Tariffs Increase Car Prices, How Else Can You Save Money?\nWill the New Jeep Compass Come to the U.S.?\n\nThe short answer: We don’t know.\n\nThe wider situation for frugal U.S. customers is a bummer given that the Compass is currently the lone Jeep model priced under $30,000, and even more so given that the new Compass’ electrified powertrains could make it even easier on fuel costs. Cars priced under $30,000 are particularly vulnerable to price increases or discontinuations due to the increased costs of production and importation under the Trump administration’s new tariffs, as many of them are currently assembled outside the U.S. to take advantage of lower labor costs.\n\nJeep parent company Stellantis has been building the current-gen Compass in Mexico, and this new generation was set to be assembled in Canada at the automaker’s Brampton, Ontario, plant. The Ontario plant was set to begin production of the new Compass in early 2026, but with retooling having been on hold since late February, per The Detroit News, it’s increasingly unlikely that Jeep will make that deadline. A Jeep representative confirmed to Cars.com that plans to bring the new Compass to the U.S. market remain on hold as the company “reassess[es] its product strategy in North America,” while also reaffirming the company’s investments in its Brampton production facility.\n\nThe European-market Compass that debuted yesterday will be assembled in Italy, which is also subject to steep import tariffs, so it’s unlikely that Jeep will import its entry-level model from there, either. We’ll simply have to wait and see if and how Jeep decides to bring the new Compass to the U.S.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When we first drove the redesigned 2022 Jeep Compass, Cars.com reviewer Brian Normile noted that the compact SUV’s high-quality cabin and upscale tech features were among its only redeeming attributes. I agreed in a subsequent review, placing much of the blame on its slow, awkward powertrain. Now it’s time to triple down: Even though the Compass got a new standard engine for 2023, this is still what’s holding it back from being good.\n\nRelated: 2022 Jeep Compass Review: Still Finding Its Way\n\nFor 2023, the previous 177-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine has been replaced with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 200 hp. The new engine pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission instead of the previous six- and nine-speed automatics. The 2023 Compass has standard four-wheel drive, and a 10.1-inch infotainment screen, drowsy-driver monitor and rear-seat reminder are also newly standard.\n\nOn paper, all of these extra standard features sound impressive, and you’d think they’d help the Compass stand out in the compact SUV class — but not so fast.\n\nThe Little Engine That Couldn’t\n\nI had high hopes for the Compass’ new engine, which adds an extra 23 hp and 49 pounds-feet of torque over the SUV’s previous lethargic powertrain, but it’s not enough. Weirdly, the new 2.0-liter engine manages to feel both peppy and sluggish.\n\nFrom a stop, acceleration is definitely livelier than the outgoing setup. The new powertrain’s responsiveness is a big step up from the old one, but power delivery is a problem. It lacks smoothness; after a bit of lag, takeoffs feel abrupt and are tough to modulate. The combination of that lag and the Compass’ hair-trigger gas pedal makes it hard to accelerate smoothly. Stopping is no better thanks to a touchy brake pedal. The result is an unsettling jerkiness that’s compounded by the Compass’ shuddering engine stop-start system.\n\nThe previous Compass I drove had an unpredictable nine-speed automatic transmission, with shifts that were sometimes lazy and sometimes hasty. At no time, however, were they smooth. Like a bad case of deja vu, the new eight-speed automatic echoes this behavior. After rushing through the lower gears at takeoff, midrange power delivery was inconsistent and often left me waiting. The new eight-speed transmission sometimes holds gears too long, and its delayed shifts made me wonder if I was accidentally in manual-shift mode. (I wasn’t.)\n\nWhat’s more, this new engine sounds very strange. At idle, there’s an unrefined clatter and vibration that’s reminiscent of a diesel. It quiets down once you get up to speed, but when you decelerate, it burbles like a wounded sports car.\n\nOne bright spot is the Compass’ fuel economy, which is improved for 2023. The new powertrain gets an EPA-estimated 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined, up from the 4WD 2022 Compass’ 22/30/25 mpg.\n\nThose new gas mileage estimates put the Compass more in line with competitors, including base AWD versions of the Honda CR-V (27/32/29 mpg) and Toyota RAV4 (27/34/30 mpg). However, the 2023 Compass’ fuel economy is still well below the Nissan Rogue’s EPA-estimated 28/35/31 mpg with AWD.\n\nIt’s Not All Bad\n\nAs with the 2022 version, there’s a lot to like inside the 2023 Compass. I tested the Latitude trim level, and its cabin was lovely, with convincing imitation-leather upholstery and classy gray fabric trim with blue contrast stitching on the doors and dash. Everything looks and feels high-quality.\n\nThat carries over to the infotainment system, which has long been a favorite of mine. As with the 2022 model, the 2023’s Uconnect 5 touchscreen system is easily the best thing about the Compass. The bigger 10.1-inch screen is now standard, and it’s highly customizable, responsive and straightforward to use. What’s more, the standard wireless smartphone connection was seamless, and the system can connect multiple devices via Bluetooth for extra flexibility.\n\nThe Compass’ other controls are still refreshingly simple, with on/off buttons for the SUV’s safety systems placed under the screen and large climate-control buttons below them.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nWith the new turbo 2.0-liter engine for 2023 after significant updates for 2022, it’s unlikely the Compass will see any more big changes in the short term. That said, the addition of an EV to the Compass lineup could help its powertrain woes, and there are signs that one might be in the works.\n\nChrysler, one of Jeep’s sibling brands under parent automaker Stellantis, has announced plans to electrify its lineup in the coming years. Though nothing specific had been announced as of this writing, there is a Compass 4xe plug-in hybrid available in Europe.\n\nAn electrified Compass would make sense; many competitors are adding hybrid and all-electric powertrains to their compact SUV lineups: The CR-V is available as a hybrid, the RAV4 can be had as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, and a Chevrolet Equinox EV is coming for 2024.\n\nThe previous Compass’ powertrain was long overdue for an overhaul, but the 2023’s new engine only creates more problems. This Jeep continues to lag its compact SUV competitors when it comes to drivetrain responsiveness and refinement, sending this Compass spinning in the wrong direction.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2022 Jeep Compass a Good SUV? 5 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\n2022 Jeep Compass Quick Spin: Not What We Wanted, But That Interior Helps\nUp Close With the 2022 Jeep Compass: Charting an Upmarket Course With New Interior, Technology\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Jeep Compass?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The old Jeep Compass is dead. An unloved creation birthed from the DaimlerChrysler days, it was based on the Dodge Caliber and shared showroom space with the equally reviled Jeep Patriot. Now in its place is a shiny new 2017 Compass, slotting in Jeep’s lineup above the diminutive Renegade and below the V-6-powered Cherokee. (The Patriot remains dead.)\n\nThe new Compass is nothing like the old one — only the name is shared. The new Compass rides on a Fiat-derived chassis that has a lot in common with other Fiat Chrysler Automobiles products. Jeep wants to put the Compass up against successful compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox. The old one couldn’t hold a candle to any of these competitors; is the new a worthy entry into a highly competitive and crowded field?\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe new Compass certainly looks the business. Its exterior styling may be its best attribute, with a baby-Grand-Cherokee look that keeps with one of the two known Jeep styles (the other being the round-eyed, chunky Wrangler look that’s also worn by the Renegade). The seven-slot grille up front is traditional but not functional (the holes aren’t open), and the headlights look like Grand Cherokee units. The wheel openings are the squarish Jeep style, as well.\n\nThe roofline is the biggest departure, with the “floating roof” look that’s starting to be much too common among new automotive designs these days. At least you can get it in either a body color or contrasting hue, so if you want the roof to blend into the body, you can.\n\nThe Trailhawk is the top-of-the-line trim, off-road-ready and Trail Rated. Opt for it and you’ll get some beefier parts, including a different front bumper for better approach angles; an inch higher ride height for better obstacle clearance; the ubiquitous red tow hooks; and blacked-out trim and hood decals for visual distinction.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOnly one engine powers the new Compass: the 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder found under the hood of a number of FCA products, including the Jeep Renegade. In the Compass, it’s mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission, in Sport and Latitude trims, or a six-speed automatic that’s standard on the Latitude 4×2 (but not the 4×4) and optional on the Sport 4×2. All other 4x4s and trims get a nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe engine makes 180 horsepower and 175 pounds-feet of torque but unfortunately does little to move the Compass with any urgency — the new Compass is slow, slow, slow. Part of the blame for that centers on the nine-speed automatic models I drove, which are tuned more for fuel economy than for acceleration.\n\nFrom a standing start, you’ll will the Compass to go faster but the engine just won’t cooperate. From a rolling start, you’ll put your foot down and not much will happen. Push through the accelerator’s travel and eventually you’ll get a kickdown from the transmission, but even then, the 2.4-liter motor sings its heart out without providing much in the way of sprightly motion. The Honda CR-V feels much more nimble, and the Kia Sportage SX Turbo would embarrass the Compass in a race up a freeway on-ramp. I’m hoping the six-speed automatic and manual transmissions are tuned to provide better acceleration, because the nine-speed matchup is a dog.\n\nHandling isn’t the Compass’ strong suit, either. I drove it on twisting, forested roads, and while the steering felt light for the first 30 degrees of travel, it firmed up considerably past that, resulting in overall feel that was both too light and too heavy. The Compass is also softly sprung, so while ride quality is good, the Compass tips and tilts in corners, with pronounced body roll. Handling isn’t much better, with prominent understeer through corners that has the little SUV pushing and scrubbing through tight sweepers.\n\nWhile the Compass may not be entertaining on the road, it shines as soon as the pavement ends. I drove Latitude and Trailhawk models, and the Trailhawk is definitely the one to have. An additional inch of lift to its suspension smooths out the ride on washboard dirt roads astonishingly well, and the way the four-wheel-drive system electronically sets all aspects of the powertrain to match the terrain is likewise astonishing.\n\nThe Trailhawk is the trail-rated version of the Compass, and it’s no joke. It felt just as capable off-road as the last Grand Cherokee Trailhawk I tested. Two four-wheel-drive systems are available on the Compass, and the Trailhawk gets the second, more advanced one, which comes with a rock-crawling mode and a 20:1 crawl ratio.\n\nThe Compass’ Selec-Terrain system allows drivers to twist a dial through Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud modes, and the Trailhawk adds a Rock mode. The Trailhawk even gets Hill Descent Control.\n\nThe problem, of course, is how many compact SUV owners are really going to take their trucks off-road? Sure, the Compass can do things the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 can only dream of, but unless you live on a dirt road, or drive one every day, the trade-offs with the rest of the Compass’ performance aren’t worth it.\n\nJeep says the Compass will have a fuel economy rating of up to 30 mpg combined, but full EPA ratings were not yet available at press time. My brief drive in the Compass was insufficient to gather real fuel economy numbers.\n\nInterior\n\nA stronger selling point for the Compass is its all-new interior, which closely mimics the insides seen on the rest of the Jeep lineup — to the point that if you didn’t know which Jeep you were sitting in, you might not know which Jeep you were sitting in. The front seats are comfortable, with decent support and plenty of room in every dimension.\n\nVisibility is also good and includes a fun Easter egg when you look in the rearview mirror, out the back window, to find something looking back at you — I won’t spoil the surprise. Material quality of the various surfaces is good, but the colors are dull. There’s none of the pizzazz in the color selections that we’ve seen before, and nothing like what’s offered in the smaller Renegade. The Trailhawk brings some touches of color to the trim, but it feels like Jeep is going conservative on its interiors again after having experimented a bit with more unique combinations.\n\nBackseat room is surprisingly good as well, with decent legroom, but headroom is curtailed by the optional moonroof. There is some road and wind noise at speed, but no more than might be found in any of the Compass’ competitors. There’s not much engine noise, either, until you floor the gas pedal, at which point the four-cylinder creates more sound than speed. My biggest quibble with the interior is a near total lack of front storage space. Cubbies and storage pockets are few, with only the front cupholders to hold a larger smartphone, and then not very securely.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe Compass benefits from having the latest FCA Uconnect technology, including a new, optional higher resolution 8.4-inch touchscreen with the latest and greatest software. The new Uconnect builds upon the goodness of the old one, with easy-to-use icons, simple menus, excellent legibility and quick functionality. A 5.0-inch touchscreen is standard, while a larger 7.0-inch and the 8.4-inch screens are optional. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now also offered on the 7.0- and 8.4-inch systems, with navigation also offered on the 8.4.\n\nThe gauge cluster features a 3.5-inch digital display; a larger 7-inch display is optional. Both are reconfigurable and customizable to the driver’s whims, as seen in other FCA products.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Compass’ overall footprint is nearly as big as the larger Cherokee; the biggest difference between the two is that the Compass comes only with a four-cylinder engine. Inside, the Compass actually has more cargo room than the Cherokee: 27.2 cubic feet of room behind the backseat and 59.8 cubic feet with it folded. That’s almost 3 cubic feet more behind the backseat than the Cherokee has, and nearly 1 cubic foot more overall room. It’s still smaller than the Kia Sportage, though, which has 30.7 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 60.1 cubic feet. The spacious Honda CR-V is also bigger, with 39.2 cubic feet in back that’s expandable to 75.8 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nAlong with the new platform comes a host of safety upgrades for the Compass. Newly featured are forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking; lane departure warning and lane keep assist; blind spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection; and automatic distance-keeping cruise control with full autonomous stop. Also available are items like automatic parallel and perpendicular park assist, and trailer sway control for towing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPricing for the new Compass had not been released as of publication, but it is expected to be competitive with other vehicles in its class. And a crowded class that is: The compact SUV segment has seen massive growth in recent years.\n\nThe Compass will fill an interesting place in the Jeep showroom. It’s not as powerful as the V-6-optional Cherokee, but it’s marginally bigger inside and should be less expensive. It does allow for the next Cherokee to get a little bit bigger, further differentiating Jeep’s offerings.\n\nCompared with its competition, the Compass falls short in on-road drivability, seating utility and cargo room. It fares quite well, however, when compared on style, amenities, comfort and available safety systems. And it absolutely spanks every other compact competitor in off-road ability, but that’s a dubious victory in this class, where on-road behavior is, frankly, far more important.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Newly available premium leather and a proper six-speed automatic transmission make the 2014 Jeep Compass the best yet, but the compact SUV continues to struggle with its cheap roots.\n\nJeep’s compact Compass was a hard sell in the burly off-road automaker’s lineup — until a redesign in 2011 brought fitting styling that casual onlookers could easily mistake for its bigger brother, the Grand Cherokee. Sales thrived. Updates sprinkled throughout the Compass’ history — in lieu of a major redesign — make the Compass you see today a mismatch between the good quality we’ve seen from Jeep in recent years and the old Jeep that lingers inside the Compass.\n\nFor 2014, Jeep adds a high-quality leather interior option and replaces a troublesome continuously variable automatic transmission with a new six-speed automatic. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 Compass here. I tested a 2014 Compass in its most expensive, Limited trim level with the optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive (one of two systems, called Freedom Drive I) that stickered at $29,375 with destination charge.   \n\nThe Compass is the more expensive relative of the similar and more traditionally styled Jeep Patriot; a base Compass costs $19,490 and the base Patriot is $16,990. For 2014, another small Jeep comes to market: the all-new Cherokee ($23,990). The modern Cherokee offers roughly the same passenger and cargo volume as the Patriot. Compare the Cherokee, Compass and Patriot’s specifications here.\nSix Welcome Improvements\nSeemingly only Nissan and Honda (in its four-cylinder 2013 Accord) have figured out how to do continuously variable automatic transmissions well. Jeep’s previous CVT was a bad experience in the Jeep Compass. It’s almost gone for 2014, replaced in most models with a conventional six-speed automatic as the optional upgrade to the standard five-speed manual. The old CVT responded slowly when passing — scratch that, when accelerating altogether — and a CVT’s nature of revving the engine to the sky made for a bad combination. The coarse-sounding engine would fill the cabin with noises foul enough for passengers to ask, “Is it supposed to sound like that?” \n\nThe $1,200 six-speed automatic costs $100 more than the CVT but is well worth the cost of admission. It’s available with the base 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder as well as the optional 172-hp, 2.4-liter I tested. The transmission isn’t an example of flawlessness, but the Compass now drives like a real SUV instead of an experiment. The transmission got the job done without much drama, though one editor wasn’t pleased with the six-speed’s gear-hunting and inconsistent downshifting while using cruise control.\n\nWith the 2.4-liter, six-speed and all-wheel drive, the 2014’s gas mileage barely increases — it’s up 1 mpg on the highway, at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined — but, honestly, I could accept taking a gas mileage hit with the six-speed, given its superior drivability over the CVT (21/26/23 mpg with Freedom Drive I all-wheel). The Compass is EPA rated at 21/28/24 mpg with standard front-wheel drive, the 2.4-liter engine and an automatic transmission, while the standard five-speed manual transmission with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter carries estimates of 23/30/26 mpg. With the automatic, the 2.0-liter is 21/28/24 mpg. The smaller engine isn’t available with all-wheel drive.  \n\nThe CVT lives on in the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package that uses the gearless transmission for its off-road-friendly, low-range crawling gear.\nNew Leather Outshines Old Interior\nThe Compass Limited, at the top of the Jeep Compass trim line, offers an attractive Saddle Brown perforated leather-wrapped interior with accent stitching for $195. It’s the only part of the interior with the quality and substance of the Jeep Grand Cherokee it tries so hard to emulate on the outside. The rich material covers the seats, door panels and center storage lid. However, the leather is out of character for the rest of the interior.\n\nWhile the new leather impresses, the rest of the interior shows its age despite a rework in 2009 that brought in much-needed softer-touch materials. There’s still no telescoping adjustment for the tilt steering wheel, the switches and buttons look and feel ancient, and the outdated, low-resolution multimedia system and gauges scream “Old Jeep.” It’s far from the exemplary quality and refinement that is the modern Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Compass having leather this nice is like Fred Flintstone wearing Armani. \n\nSignificant redesigns in recent years have kept the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape up to date. Compare the Compass against its competition here.\n\nLike the Grand Cherokee, however, front-seat comfort is good for my 6-foot-tall frame. Backseat room is on the smaller side compared with many small SUVs, which isn’t helped by a cramped rear floor. A medium-sized hump and narrow footwell take up space, while seating brackets from the front seats intrude on available foot room for rear passengers. Stepping into the Compass’s comfy seats may not be easy for everyone; its high, 8.1 inches of ground clearance comes with higher seats as well. Lower-riding SUVs like the CR-V have as little as 6.3 inches of ground clearance and lower step-in heights.\nOn the Road\nThe Compass is one of the only small SUVs with dedication to off-roading. High ground clearance, multiple all-wheel-drive systems, available off-road tires and much more give the Compass off-road credibility and a Trail Rated badge when equipped with the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package. What works off-road isn’t always a success on-road, though. The previous 2012 Compass I drove with the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package, all-terrain tires and extra inch of ride height made a three-hour road trip unpleasant, as the SUV was a wandering mess on the highway.\n\nThe 2014 Compass I tested without the off-road package surprised me with how well it handled. Its ride was comfortable, plus it wasn’t offended in corners and showed agility for an SUV.\n\nThough it’s quiet around town, the wind noise shooting past the Compass’ A-pillars was persistent and loud enough to make me check the window switches to make sure all the windows were closed at 65 mph. Other editors and passengers noticed the noise as well. The 172-hp engine provides decent acceleration, especially with the new transmission, but its coarse-sounding engine at higher engine speeds is off-putting. Luckily, the Compass is not a sports car that needs to be revved out too often.  \nCargo & Towing\nThe Compass has a skimpy 22.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 53.6 cubic feet of available space with the rear seats folded; there’s an available 62.7 cubic feet with a flat-folding front passenger seat on Latitude and Limited trim levels. Space behind the rear and front seats is fairly puny compared with the CR-V (37.2/70.9), Escape (34.3/67.8) and RAV4 (38.4/73.4). Frequent cargo loaders may also find the task inconvenient: The load-in height is high because of the SUV’s high ride height and tall rear bumper.\n\nThe longer and wider Cherokee doesn’t offer much improvement over the Compass, measuring in at 24.8/54.9 cubic feet.\n\nA towing capacity of 2,000 pounds is available with the optional Trailer-tow Prep Group for $250, which includes an engine oil cooler, a full-size spare tire and a trailer wiring harness. Without the package, the Jeep Compass’ towing maximum is rated at 1,000 pounds. The Patriot is rated with the same figures while the Cherokee has a maximum 2,000 pounds capacity standard.\nSafety\nThe 2014 Jeep Compass doesn’t have full crash-test ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. What ratings do exist are shared ones with the similar Jeep Patriot, and those are only for side-impact crash tests. The Patriot and Compass are rated Good in IIHS’ side-impact testing. Ratings for rear crash protection are also Good. The Compass has not gone through the institute’s frontal, small overlap or roof-strength testing.\n\nNHTSA reports only frontal and rollover ratings for the Compass, resulting in three out of five stars in frontal tests and a rollover result of four out of five stars.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes the federally mandated electronic stability system, antilock brakes and frontal airbags. Standard safety features also include side-curtain airbags for front and rear occupants and side-impact torso airbags for front occupants. A backup camera is optional on Sport and Latitude trims and standard on Limited models. More safety features are viewable here.    \n\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the 2014 Compass in our Car Seat Check.\n2014 Jeep Compass in the Market\nWith a $19,490 base price, including destination, the Compass is less expensive than competitors. While the Compass remains inexpensive and small, other small SUVs are growing not only in price, but also in size and feature content. Considering the base Compass has no telescoping steering wheel or USB input, and that it comes with a manual transmission, front-wheel drive and a less-powerful 2.0-liter engine, it’s not difficult to add enough equipment to raise the Compass’ price to the level of better-equipped competitors.\n\nThe Jeep Compass’ value factor is quickly lost when comparing it with other small SUVs at the same price — unless you’re someone who geeks out on low-range gears, approach angles and tow hooks.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The old Jeep Compass is dead. An unloved creation birthed from the DaimlerChrysler days, it was based on the Dodge Caliber and shared showroom space with the equally reviled Jeep Patriot. Now in its place is a shiny new 2017 Compass, slotting in Jeep’s lineup above the diminutive Renegade and below the V-6-powered Cherokee. (The Patriot remains dead.)\n\nThe new Jeep Compass is nothing like the old one — only the name is shared. The new Compass rides on a Fiat-derived chassis that has a lot in common with other Fiat Chrysler Automobiles products. Jeep wants to put the Compass up against successful compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox. The old one couldn’t hold a candle to any of these competitors; is the new a worthy entry into a highly competitive and crowded field?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe all-new Jeep Compass certainly looks the business. Its exterior styling may be its best attribute, with a baby-Grand-Cherokee look that keeps with one of the two known Jeep styles (the other being the round-eyed, chunky Wrangler look that’s also worn by the Renegade). The seven-slot grille up front is traditional but not functional (the holes aren’t open), and the headlights look like Grand Cherokee units. The wheel openings are the squarish Jeep style, as well.\n\nThe roofline is the biggest departure, with the “floating roof” look that’s starting to be much too common among new automotive designs these days. At least you can get it in either a body color or contrasting hue, so if you want the roof to blend into the body, you can.\n\nThe Trailhawk is the top-of-the-line trim, off-road-ready and Trail Rated. Opt for it and you’ll get some beefier parts, including a different front bumper for better approach angles; an inch higher ride height for better obstacle clearance; the ubiquitous red tow hooks; and blacked-out trim and hood decals for visual distinction.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOnly one engine powers the new Jeep Compass: the 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder found under the hood of a number of FCA products, including the Jeep Renegade. In the Compass, it’s mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission, in Sport and Latitude trims, or a six-speed automatic that’s standard on the Latitude 4×2 (but not the 4×4) and optional on the Sport 4×2. All other 4x4s and trims get a nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe engine makes 180 horsepower and 175 pounds-feet of torque but unfortunately does little to move the Compass with any urgency — the new Compass is slow, slow, slow. Part of the blame for that centers on the nine-speed automatic models I drove, which are tuned more for fuel economy than for acceleration.\n\nFrom a standing start, you’ll will the Jeep Compass to go faster but the engine just won’t cooperate. From a rolling start, you’ll put your foot down and not much will happen. Push through the accelerator’s travel and eventually you’ll get a kickdown from the transmission, but even then, the 2.4-liter motor sings its heart out without providing much in the way of sprightly motion. The Honda CR-V feels much more nimble, and the Kia Sportage SX Turbo would embarrass the Compass in a race up a freeway on-ramp. I’m hoping the six-speed automatic and manual transmissions are tuned to provide better acceleration, because the nine-speed matchup is a dog.\n\nHandling isn’t the Compass’ strong suit, either. I drove it on twisting, forested roads, and while the steering felt light for the first 30 degrees of travel, it firmed up considerably past that, resulting in overall feel that was both too light and too heavy. The Compass is also softly sprung, so while ride quality is good, the Compass tips and tilts in corners, with pronounced body roll. Handling isn’t much better, with prominent understeer through corners that has the little SUV pushing and scrubbing through tight sweepers.\n\nThe Jeep Compass’ Selec-Terrain system allows drivers to twist a dial through Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud modes, and the Trailhawk adds a Rock mode. The Trailhawk even gets Hill Descent Control.\n\nThe problem, of course, is how many compact SUV owners are really going to take their trucks off-road? Sure, the Jeep Compass can do things similar body types like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 can only dream of, but unless you live on a dirt road, or drive one every day, the trade-offs with the rest of the Compass’ performance aren’t worth it.\n\nJeep says the Compass will have a fuel economy rating of up to 30 mpg combined, but full EPA ratings were not yet available at press time. My brief drive in the Compass was insufficient to gather real fuel economy numbers.\n\nInterior\n\nA stronger selling point for the Jeep Compass is its all-new interior, which closely mimics the insides seen on the rest of the Jeep lineup — to the point that if you didn’t know which Jeep you were sitting in, you might not know which Jeep you were sitting in. The front seats are comfortable, with decent support and plenty of room in every dimension.\n\nVisibility is also good and includes a fun Easter egg when you look in the rearview mirror, out the back window, to find something looking back at you — I won’t spoil the surprise. Material quality of the various surfaces is good, but the colors are dull. There’s none of the pizzazz in the color selections that we’ve seen before, and nothing like what’s offered in the smaller Renegade. The Trailhawk brings some touches of color to the trim, but it feels like Jeep is going conservative on its interiors again after having experimented a bit with more unique combinations.\n\nBackseat room is surprisingly good as well, with decent legroom, but headroom is curtailed by the optional moonroof. There is some road and wind noise at speed, but no more than might be found in any of the Compass’ competitors. There’s not much engine noise, either, until you floor the gas pedal, at which point the four-cylinder creates more sound than speed. My biggest quibble with the interior is a near total lack of front storage space. Cubbies and storage pockets are few, with only the front cupholders to hold a larger smartphone, and then not very securely.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Jeep Compass benefits from having the latest FCA Uconnect technology, including a new, optional higher resolution 8.4-inch touchscreen with the latest and greatest software. The new Uconnect builds upon the goodness of the old one, with easy-to-use icons, simple menus, excellent legibility and quick functionality. A 5.0-inch touchscreen is standard, while a larger 7.0-inch and the 8.4-inch screens are optional. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now also offered on the 7.0- and 8.4-inch systems, with navigation also offered on the 8.4.\n\nThe gauge cluster features a 3.5-inch digital display; a larger 7-inch display is optional. Both are reconfigurable and customizable to the driver’s whims, as seen in other FCA products.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Compass’ overall footprint is nearly as big as the larger Cherokee; the biggest difference between the two is that the Compass comes only with a four-cylinder engine. Inside, the Compass actually has more cargo room than the Cherokee: 27.2 cubic feet of room behind the backseat and 59.8 cubic feet with it folded. That’s almost 3 cubic feet more behind the backseat than the Cherokee has, and nearly 1 cubic foot more overall room. It’s still smaller than the Kia Sportage, though, which has 30.7 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 60.1 cubic feet. The spacious Honda CR-V is also bigger, with 39.2 cubic feet in back that’s expandable to 75.8 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nAlong with the new platform comes a host of safety upgrades for the Jeep Compass. Newly featured are forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking; lane departure warning and lane keep assist; blind spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection; and automatic distance-keeping cruise control with full autonomous stop. Also available are items like automatic parallel and perpendicular park assist, and trailer sway control for towing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPricing for the new Compass had not been released as of publication, but it is expected to be competitive with other vehicles in its class. And a crowded class that is: The compact SUV segment has seen massive growth in recent years.\n\nThe Jeep Compass will fill an interesting place in the Jeep showroom. It’s not as powerful as the V-6-optional Cherokee, but it’s marginally bigger inside and should be less expensive. It does allow for the next Cherokee to get a little bit bigger, further differentiating Jeep’s offerings.\n\nCompared with its competition, the Jeep Compass falls short in on-road drivability, seating utility and cargo room. It fares quite well, however, when compared on style, amenities, comfort and available safety systems. And it absolutely spanks every other compact competitor in off-road ability, but that’s a dubious victory in this class, where on-road behavior is, frankly, far more important.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2014 Jeep Compass. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\nNewly available premium leather and a proper six-speed automatic transmission make the 2014 Jeep Compass the best yet, but the compact SUV continues to struggle with its cheap roots.\nJeep’s compact Compass was a hard sell in the burly off-road automaker’s lineup — until a redesign in 2011 brought fitting styling that casual onlookers could easily mistake for its bigger brother, the Grand Cherokee. Sales thrived. Updates sprinkled throughout the Compass’ history — in lieu of a major redesign — make the Compass you see today a mismatch between the good quality we’ve seen from Jeep in recent years and the old Jeep that lingers inside the Compass.\nFor 2014, Jeep adds a high-quality leather interior option and replaces a troublesome continuously variable automatic transmission with a new six-speed automatic. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 Compass here. I tested a 2014 Compass in its most expensive, Limited trim level with the optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive (one of two systems, called Freedom Drive I) that stickered at $29,375 with destination charge.\nThe Compass is the more expensive relative of the similar and more traditionally styled Jeep Patriot; a base Compass costs $19,490 and the base Patriot is $16,990. For 2014, another small Jeep comes to market: the all-new Cherokee ($23,990). The modern Cherokee offers roughly the same passenger and cargo volume as the Patriot. Compare the Cherokee, Compass and Patriot’s specifications here.\nSix Welcome ImprovementsSeemingly only Nissan and Honda (in its four-cylinder 2013 Accord) have figured out how to do continuously variable automatic transmissions well. Jeep’s previous CVT was a bad experience in the Compass. It’s almost gone for 2014, replaced in most models with a conventional six-speed automatic as the optional upgrade to the standard five-speed manual. The old CVT responded slowly when passing — scratch that, when accelerating altogether — and a CVT’s nature of revving the engine to the sky made for a bad combination. The coarse-sounding engine would fill the cabin with noises foul enough for passengers to ask, “Is it supposed to sound like that?”\nThe $1,200 six-speed automatic costs $100 more than the CVT but is well worth the cost of admission. It’s available with the base 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder as well as the optional 172-hp, 2.4-liter I tested. The transmission isn’t an example of flawlessness, but the Compass now drives like a real SUV instead of an experiment. The transmission got the job done without much drama, though one editor wasn’t pleased with the six-speed’s gear-hunting and inconsistent downshifting while using cruise control.\nWith the 2.4-liter, six-speed and all-wheel drive, the 2014’s gas mileage barely increases — it’s up 1 mpg on the highway, at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined — but, honestly, I could accept taking a gas mileage hit with the six-speed, given its superior drivability over the CVT (21/26/23 mpg with Freedom Drive I all-wheel drive). The Compass is EPA rated at 21/28/24 mpg with standard front-wheel drive, the 2.4-liter engine and an automatic transmission, while the standard five-speed manual transmission with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter carries estimates of 23/30/26 mpg. With the automatic, the 2.0-liter is 21/28/24 mpg. The smaller engine isn’t available with all-wheel drive.\nThe CVT lives on in the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package that uses the gearless transmission for its off-road-friendly, low-range crawling gear.\nNew Leather Outshines Old InteriorThe Compass Limited, at the top of the Compass trim line, offers an attractive Saddle Brown perforated leather interior with accent stitching for $195. It’s the only part of the interior with the quality and substance of the Jeep Grand Cherokee it tries so hard to emulate on the outside. The rich material covers the seats, door panels and center storage lid. However, the leather is out of character for the rest of the interior.\nWhile the new leather impresses, the rest of the interior shows its age despite a rework in 2009 that brought in much-needed softer-touch materials. There’s still no telescoping adjustment for the tilt steering wheel, the switches and buttons look and feel ancient, and the outdated, low-resolution multimedia system and gauges scream “Old Jeep.” It’s far from the exemplary quality and refinement that is the modern Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Compass having leather this nice is like Fred Flintstone wearing Armani.\nSignificant redesigns in recent years have kept the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape up to date. Compare the Compass against its competition here.\nLike the Grand Cherokee, however, front-seat comfort is good for my 6-foot-tall frame. Backseat room is on the smaller side compared with many small SUVs, which isn’t helped by a cramped rear floor. A medium-sized hump and narrow footwell take up space, while seating brackets from the front seats intrude on available foot room for rear passengers. Stepping into the Compass’s comfy seats may not be easy for everyone; its high, 8.1 inches of ground clearance comes with higher seats as well. Lower-riding SUVs like the CR-V have as little as 6.3 inches of ground clearance and lower step-in heights.\nOn the RoadThe Compass is one of the only small SUVs with dedication to off-roading. High ground clearance, multiple all-wheel-drive systems, available off-road tires and much more give the Compass off-road credibility and a Trail Rated badge when equipped with the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package. What works off-road isn’t always a success on-road, though. The previous 2012 Compass I drove with the Freedom Drive II Off-road Package, all-terrain tires and extra inch of ride height made a three-hour road trip unpleasant, as the SUV was a wandering mess on the highway.\nThe 2014 Compass I tested without the off-road package surprised me with how well it handled. Its ride was comfortable, plus it wasn’t offended in corners and showed agility for an SUV.\nThough it’s quiet around town, the wind noise shooting past the Compass’ A-pillars was persistent and loud enough to make me check the window switches to make sure all the windows were closed at 65 mph. Other editors and passengers noticed the noise as well. The 172-hp engine provides decent acceleration, especially with the new transmission, but its coarse-sounding engine at higher engine speeds is off-putting. Luckily, the Compass is not a sports car that needs to be revved out too often.\nCargo & TowingThe Compass has a skimpy 22.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 53.6 cubic feet of available space with the rear seats folded; there’s an available 62.7 cubic feet with a flat-folding front passenger seat on Latitude and Limited trim levels. Space behind the rear and front seats is fairly puny compared with the CR-V (37.2/70.9), Escape (34.3/67.8) and RAV4 (38.4/73.4). Frequent cargo loaders may also find the task inconvenient: The load-in height is high because of the SUV’s high ride height and tall rear bumper.\nThe longer and wider Cherokee doesn’t offer much improvement over the Compass, measuring in at 24.8/54.9 cubic feet.\nA towing capacity of 2,000 pounds is available with the optional Trailer-tow Prep Group for $250, which includes an engine oil cooler, a full-size spare tire and a trailer wiring harness. Without the package, the Compass’ towing maximum is rated at 1,000 pounds. The Patriot is rated with the same figures while the Cherokee has a maximum 2,000 pounds capacity standard.\nSafetyThe 2014 Jeep Compass doesn’t have full crash-test ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. What ratings do exist are shared ones with the similar Jeep Patriot, and those are only for side-impact crash tests. The Patriot and Compass are rated Good in IIHS’ side-impact testing. Ratings for rear crash protection are also Good. The Compass has not gone through the institute’s frontal, small overlap or roof-strength testing.\nNHTSA reports only frontal and rollover ratings for the Compass, resulting in three out of five stars in frontal tests and a rollover result of four out of five stars.\nStandard safety equipment includes the federally mandated electronic stability system, antilock brakes and frontal airbags. Standard safety features also include side-curtain airbags for front and rear occupants and side-impact torso airbags for front occupants. A backup camera is optional on Sport and Latitude trims and standard on Limited models. More safety features are viewable here.\nSee how well child-safety seats fit in the 2014 Compass in our Car Seat Check.\n2014 Jeep Compass in the MarketWith a $19,490 starting price, including destination, the Compass is less expensive than competitors. While the Compass remains inexpensive and small, other small SUVs are growing not only in price, but also in size and feature content. Considering the base Compass has no telescoping steering wheel or USB input, and that it comes with a manual transmission, front-wheel drive and a less-powerful 2.0-liter engine, it’s not difficult to add enough equipment to raise the Compass’ price to the level of better-equipped competitors.\nThe Compass’ value factor is quickly lost when comparing it with other small SUVs at the same price — unless you’re someone who geeks out on low-range gears, approach angles and tow hooks.\n\n\n\n          email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Jeep Compass — especially in off-road-ready Trailhawk trim — has the potential to be one of the spiciest models in a bland compact SUV class, but with an anemic powertrain and embarrassing fuel economy, it has lost its way. \n\nVersus the competition: The Compass’ multimedia system is among the easiest to use in the class, but the SUV lags rivals in power, standard safety features and fuel economy.   \n\nThe Jeep Compass is in the popular and ever-expanding compact SUV class. It goes against the likes of the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4; see them compared. \n\nThe Compass comes in Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk trim levels. I tested the Trailhawk, and aside from its more aggressive styling (mine had a two-tone black and Spitfire Orange exterior), it’s loaded with off-road goodies: Trailhawks get a lifted suspension, off-road tires, skid plates, tow hooks, hill descent control and Jeep’s Active Drive Low four-wheel-drive system, which adds a low range.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV of 2019?\n\nThe Slow Lane\n\nIf you’re off-roading in a Compass Trailhawk, slow is your speed — and the Trailhawk delivers. Anyone not driving off-road will be left wanting: The sole engine is a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s adequate at best. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and six- and nine-speed automatics are available. My test model had the nine-speed and it was unpredictable, with shifts that were at times lazy and at other times hasty. At no time, however, were they smooth.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to take the Trailhawk off-road, but it proved to be comfortable on-road, with a compliant, bump-absorbent ride and clean, composed handling.\n\nIts road manners are fine overall, but its lack of character doesn’t help it stand out in the class. \n\nIts automatic engine stop-start system is a weak point, with rough and obtrusive shuddering on both shutdown and restart. Even more annoying is that it doesn’t appear to help in the fuel-economy department: In base front-wheel-drive guise with the six-speed automatic, the Compass is rated 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined — much lower than its competitors’ base front-drive versions: The Honda CR-V is rated 28/34/30 mpg, the Toyota RAV4 is 27/35/30 mpg and the Escape is 27/33/30 mpg. What’s more, these vehicles all offer some type of hybrid powertrain (hybrid or plug-in hybrid) for those who want even higher mileage; the Compass doesn’t.\n\nCabin Comforts \n\nThe Compass I drove had a cabin dressed in a sharp black and red leather combo, and everything felt appropriately cushy and padded. The front seat was comfortable for people, but once we were in there, our stuff didn’t fit; you’ll have to fight with your front passenger to store small items. There’s a small but deep center console storage box but no room under the controls to stash a phone. There are two teensy netted storage areas near each front occupant’s knees, but they’re not easy to reach.  \n\nThe highlight of the cabin is the Uconnect 4 touchscreen multimedia system, which has long been a favorite of ours for its large, clear screen and straightforward menus and controls. A 7-inch touchscreen is standard on the Compass; my car was equipped with the larger 8.4-inch screen. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard. The screen’s placement on the dash is easy to reach and one of the most drama-free systems I’ve used. The Uconnect 4 system has stayed current thanks to frequent updates, and another update is coming for the 2021 model year that will include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  \n\nIn back, legroom is comfortable for two adults; by the numbers, the Compass is mid-pack in the segment with 38.3 inches of legroom. Rear headroom trails competitors slightly, but at 5 foot, 6 inches, I had ample space. Two car seats fit fine and were easy to install thanks to accessible lower Latch anchors.  \n\nBehind the backseat, there’s 27.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The opening is wide, but the amount of space falls well short of the CR-V (39.2), Escape (37.5) and RAV4 (37.6). The seats fold down in a 60/40 split to create 59.8 cubic feet of maximum space — again, much less than rivals. \n\nSafety and Value\n\nWhere it looks like the Compass stands out over the competition is in price, but that’s not exactly accurate. The 2020 Compass starts at $23,775, but that’s for a base model with a manual transmission. Most competitors come with standard automatics, and the Compass costs $27,120 when equipped that way (all prices include destination). The Escape starts at $26,130, the base CR-V at $26,270 and the base RAV4 at $27,125. \n\nSafety features are another caveat. For 2020, Jeep made more advanced safety features available on the base Sport trim level, but it didn’t go far enough. Many active safety features that are standard on other compact SUVs, such as the CR-V and RAV4, are still optional on the base Compass. If you want active safety features like automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning on a base Compass, you’ll have to opt for a $945 Advanced Safety Group option package. Blind spot monitoring is in a different safety package that costs an additional $945. \n\nThe Jeep Compass, especially in Trailhawk trim, has one of the most robust off-road setups in the compact SUV class. Only the Toyota RAV4 Adventure model can match it, but the RAV4 does many other things better than the Compass. And if you’re not looking to go off-road, the Compass’ weaknesses mount quickly. As competitors continue to add more standard safety features and increase fuel efficiency, it’s apparent the Compass needs to head in a new direction.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Jeep Compass: What’s Changed\nWhat Is Uconnect and Is Uconnect Worth It? \n2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee: What’s Changed\nWinter Is Coming and Jeep Is Ready\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A reboot elevates the 2022 Jeep Compass with updated tech and much-needed cabin refinement, but it’s not enough: The compact SUV’s slow, inefficient and awkward powertrain is a major letdown.\n\nVersus the competition: The Compass’ slick, modern multimedia system and high-quality interior excel, but the SUV continues to lag rivals in engine refinement, fuel economy and cargo space.\n\nFor 2022, Jeep’s Compass compact SUV gets a revamped interior, updated tech and a new Latitude Lux trim level. The number of trims has been reduced from seven to five, with that new Latitude Lux slotting right in the middle. More safety features are now standard, and some new convenience features are available. Compare it with the outgoing model year and the most similar vehicles in Jeep’s lineup, the smaller Renegade and larger Cherokee.\n\nRelated: Jeep Compass: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n\nThe Compass competes against the likes of the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue, which earned the top spot in Cars.com’s Compact SUV Challenge in 2021; see them compared.\n\nUconnect Wins (Again)\n\nEasily the best thing about the Compass is its next-generation Uconnect 5 touchscreen system. It’s an upgrade over the previous version, adding over-the-air updates and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. With this new version, Chrysler has raised the bar on an already great system.\n\nChief among its perks for 2022 are larger screens. An 8.4-inch touchscreen is standard, up from 7 inches in the outgoing model. A 10.1-inch touchscreen is also available, as is a color 10.25-inch frameless digital gauge cluster with customizable menus, which can be had in the Limited and Trailhawk trim levels. Lower trims can have either the standard 3.5-inch gauge cluster or an available 7-inch full-color cluster.\n\nI tested the larger unit, and the screen sits high on the dash for easy reach and visibility. Using it was delightful; each time I drove the Compass, it took me from silence to my favorite podcast in seconds thanks to a seamless wireless Android Auto connection. What’s more, the system has enhanced customizability via user profiles, and it can connect multiple devices via Bluetooth for extra flexibility. It’s responsive, quick and straightforward to use. A wireless charging pad is optional.\n\nThe Compass’ other controls are refreshingly simple, with on/off buttons for the car’s safety systems displayed under the screen, plus large climate buttons and dials below them.\n\nNice Digs\n\nThe tech-focused cabin gives the new Compass a much more upscale feel than the old version — and big improvements in design and materials help, too. The cabin of my top-of-the-line Limited four-wheel-drive trim was lovely — and a big contrast over the outgoing model’s bland, plastic-heavy interior.\n\nOf course, plastic is prevalent here, too, but there’s more of the softer-touch stuff now, and it’s incorporated with more of an eye for design; the overall result is less utilitarian. There’s a handsome two-tone color theme, and nice touches including dashboard stitching and supple leather seats combine to make one of the nicest cabins in the class.\n\nThe new cabin also benefits from added creature comforts and improved storage — an area that needed work in the 2020 Compass. Newly available niceties include heated rear seats and a hands-free, foot-activated power liftgate. The new Latitude Lux trim gets extras like wireless charging and a dual-pane panoramic moonroof.\n\nMore cabin space for small items is another welcome addition. A revised parking brake helped make way for a large front bin under the touchscreen, which the old model lacked but sorely needed.\n\nWhen it comes to cargo space, however, the Compass continues to fall short. By Cars.com’s measurements, the Compass has 16.04 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats — considerably less than the Honda CR-V (21.46), Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (20.69) and Nissan Rogue (17.12 in the base trim or 19.29 with an available cargo management system). There’s still a lot to like, though: The cargo opening is wide, and the Limited trim’s big cargo mat helps mitigate messes. I found the space adequate for a large grocery run.\n\nThe Compass is mid-pack in terms of backseat legroom and headroom; my 5-foot-6-inch self fit comfortably on the supportive, bolstered seats. The compact SUV earned mostly high grades in our Car Seat Check thanks to easy-access Latch anchors and ample space for two car seats.\n\nAll Aboard the Struggle Bus\n\nWhat hasn’t changed in the Compass is what needs the most work: Its wonky, weak powertrain carries over for 2022, and it’s long overdue for an overhaul. It continues to lag competitors in both responsiveness and refinement.\n\nThe 2.4-liter four-cylinder plods on as the only available engine, with the only change being a slight drop in horsepower — 180 to 177, thanks to a move toward efficiency (more on that below). Lower-level Sport and Latitude trims have standard front-wheel drive and optional four-wheel drive, while Latitude Lux, Limited and Trailhawk versions all get standard 4WD. Once again this year, the Trailhawk is the most off-road-capable trim level thanks to Jeep’s Active Drive Low 4×4 system with hill descent control, Selec-Terrain Rock mode and 8.6 inches of ground clearance.\n\nNot much feels particularly quick in this class, but the Compass is especially slow, with responsiveness that’s hampered by a clunky engine stop-start system and a clumsy transmission.\n\nPower is adequate from a stop, but on the highway — especially on-ramps and during passing maneuvers — it struggles and complains while getting up to speed louder than my 11-year-old on a Monday morning.\n\nFront-wheel-drive models use a six-speed automatic transmission again for 2022, with 4WD versions using a nine-speed automatic. The Compass I drove was equipped with the unpredictable nine-speed, featuring shifts that were at times lazy and at other times hasty. At no time, however, were they smooth.\n\nThe vehicle gets yet another demerit for fuel efficiency: The Compass is EPA-rated 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined with 4WD. That’s the same rating as 2021 despite efforts to improve it, and it’s much lower than AWD versions of the Honda CR-V (27/32/29 mpg) and Toyota RAV4 (27/33/29 mpg). It’s also considerably lower than this segment’s big fuel economy winner: the Nissan Rogue, which gets an EPA-estimated 28/35/31 mpg with AWD.\n\nMany automakers are adding hybrids and electric powertrains to their compact SUV lineups, but the Compass has none. The CR-V is available as a hybrid, and the RAV4 can be had as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid. More models are coming, too: Chevrolet is adding an electric variant to the Equinox lineup, and new small electric SUVs are due soon from Toyota and Subaru.\n\nJeep affiliate brand Chrysler has announced plans to electrify its lineup in the coming years. This bodes well for the Compass, but nothing specific has been announced as of this writing.\n\nYes, there’s a lot to dislike about the Compass, but it’s not all bad. One high point is its road manners, which are better than average in this class. It has pretty soft tuning, with a ride that’s overall compliant and bump-absorbent, and clean, composed handling. Other small SUVs have firmer rides and don’t deal with impact harshness as well as the Compass does. Although I felt the steering was tuned too lightly and required a lot of corrections, I found the Compass to be maneuverable and comfortable to drive (once the transmission settled down and we managed to get up to speed).\n\nSafety and Value\n\nOne other big complaint about the outgoing Compass has been addressed for 2022: safety features. For 2022, all Compass trims have standard forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection; lane departure warning with lane keep assist; and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. Adaptive cruise control, park assist and a 360-degree camera system are optional on mid-level trims and standard on top ones. Traffic sign recognition is also available on upper trims. A semi-autonomous driving system is slated to arrive later in the model year.\n\nThe addition of those standard safety features — which the Compass’ main competitors also include — brings a roughly $1,900 price bump compared with the outgoing model. That said, the Compass is still priced competitively.  The 2022 model starts at $27,615 for the base Sport trim with 2WD; AWD adds $1,500. That’s roughly on par with base versions of the CR-V ($27,625), RAV4 ($27,740) and Rogue ($27,875). All prices include destination.\n\nThe Compass plays in a tightly packed field of competent compact SUVs, and its balance of on-road comfort and off-road chops (particularly the Trailhawk trim) helps it stand out — as do its top-notch multimedia system and quality cabin. Its problem areas, however, remain large, and they’re tough to overlook. Although the updates for 2022 were a good effort, they fail to address some of the Compass’ weakest points.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The old Jeep Compass is dead. An unloved creation birthed from the DaimlerChrysler days, it was based on the Dodge Caliber and shared showroom space with the equally reviled Jeep Patriot. Now in its place is a shiny new 2017 Compass, slotting in Jeep’s lineup above the diminutive Renegade and below the V-6-powered Cherokee. (The Patriot remains dead.)\n\nThe new Compass is nothing like the old one — only the name is shared. The new Compass rides on a Fiat-derived chassis that has a lot in common with other Fiat Chrysler Automobiles products. Jeep wants to put the Compass up against successful compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox. The old one couldn’t hold a candle to any of these competitors; is the new a worthy entry into a highly competitive and crowded field?\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe new Compass certainly looks the business. Its exterior styling may be its best attribute, with a baby-Grand-Cherokee look that keeps with one of the two known Jeep styles (the other being the round-eyed, chunky Wrangler look that’s also worn by the Renegade). The seven-slot grille up front is traditional but not functional (the holes aren’t open), and the headlights look like Grand Cherokee units. The wheel openings are the squarish Jeep style, as well.\n\nThe roofline is the biggest departure, with the “floating roof” look that’s starting to be much too common among new automotive designs these days. At least you can get it in either a body color or contrasting hue, so if you want the roof to blend into the body, you can.\n\nThe Trailhawk is the top-of-the-line trim, off-road-ready and Trail Rated. Opt for it and you’ll get some beefier parts, including a different front bumper for better approach angles; an inch higher ride height for better obstacle clearance; the ubiquitous red tow hooks; and blacked-out trim and hood decals for visual distinction.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOnly one engine powers the new Compass: the 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder found under the hood of a number of FCA products, including the Jeep Renegade. In the Compass, it’s mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission, in Sport and Latitude trims, or a six-speed automatic that’s standard on the Latitude 4×2 (but not the 4×4) and optional on the Sport 4×2. All other 4x4s and trims get a nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe engine makes 180 horsepower and 175 pounds-feet of torque but unfortunately does little to move the Compass with any urgency — the new Compass is slow, slow, slow. Part of the blame for that centers on the nine-speed automatic models I drove, which are tuned more for fuel economy than for acceleration.\n\nFrom a standing start, you’ll will the Compass to go faster but the engine just won’t cooperate. From a rolling start, you’ll put your foot down and not much will happen. Push through the accelerator’s travel and eventually you’ll get a kickdown from the transmission, but even then, the 2.4-liter motor sings its heart out without providing much in the way of sprightly motion. The Honda CR-V feels much more nimble, and the Kia Sportage SX Turbo would embarrass the Compass in a race up a freeway on-ramp. I’m hoping the six-speed automatic and manual transmissions are tuned to provide better acceleration, because the nine-speed matchup is a dog.\n\nHandling isn’t the Compass’ strong suit, either. I drove it on twisting, forested roads, and while the steering felt light for the first 30 degrees of travel, it firmed up considerably past that, resulting in overall feel that was both too light and too heavy. The Compass is also softly sprung, so while ride quality is good, the Compass tips and tilts in corners, with pronounced body roll. Handling isn’t much better, with prominent understeer through corners that has the little SUV pushing and scrubbing through tight sweepers.\n\nWhile the Compass may not be entertaining on the road, it shines as soon as the pavement ends. I drove Latitude and Trailhawk models, and the Trailhawk is definitely the one to have. An additional inch of lift to its suspension smooths out the ride on washboard dirt roads astonishingly well, and the way the four-wheel-drive system electronically sets all aspects of the powertrain to match the terrain is likewise astonishing.\n\nThe Trailhawk is the trail-rated version of the Compass, and it’s no joke. It felt just as capable off-road as the last Grand Cherokee Trailhawk I tested. Two four-wheel-drive systems are available on the Compass, and the Trailhawk gets the second, more advanced one, which comes with a rock-crawling mode and a 20:1 crawl ratio.\n\nThe Compass’ Selec-Terrain system allows drivers to twist a dial through Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud modes, and the Trailhawk adds a Rock mode. The Trailhawk even gets Hill Descent Control.\n\nThe problem, of course, is how many compact SUV owners are really going to take their trucks off-road? Sure, the Compass can do things the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 can only dream of, but unless you live on a dirt road, or drive one every day, the trade-offs with the rest of the Compass’ performance aren’t worth it.\n\nJeep says the Compass will have a fuel economy rating of up to 30 mpg combined, but full EPA ratings were not yet available at press time. My brief drive in the Compass was insufficient to gather real fuel economy numbers.\n\nInterior\n\nA stronger selling point for the Compass is its all-new interior, which closely mimics the insides seen on the rest of the Jeep lineup — to the point that if you didn’t know which Jeep you were sitting in, you might not know which Jeep you were sitting in. The front seats are comfortable, with decent support and plenty of room in every dimension.\n\nVisibility is also good and includes a fun Easter egg when you look in the rearview mirror, out the back window, to find something looking back at you — I won’t spoil the surprise. Material quality of the various surfaces is good, but the colors are dull. There’s none of the pizzazz in the color selections that we’ve seen before, and nothing like what’s offered in the smaller Renegade. The Trailhawk brings some touches of color to the trim, but it feels like Jeep is going conservative on its interiors again after having experimented a bit with more unique combinations.\n\nBackseat room is surprisingly good as well, with decent legroom, but headroom is curtailed by the optional moonroof. There is some road and wind noise at speed, but no more than might be found in any of the Compass’ competitors. There’s not much engine noise, either, until you floor the gas pedal, at which point the four-cylinder creates more sound than speed. My biggest quibble with the interior is a near total lack of front storage space. Cubbies and storage pockets are few, with only the front cupholders to hold a larger smartphone, and then not very securely.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe Compass benefits from having the latest FCA Uconnect technology, including a new, optional higher resolution 8.4-inch touchscreen with the latest and greatest software. The new Uconnect builds upon the goodness of the old one, with easy-to-use icons, simple menus, excellent legibility and quick functionality. A 5.0-inch touchscreen is standard, while a larger 7.0-inch and the 8.4-inch screens are optional. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now also offered on the 7.0- and 8.4-inch systems, with navigation also offered on the 8.4.\n\nThe gauge cluster features a 3.5-inch digital display; a larger 7-inch display is optional. Both are reconfigurable and customizable to the driver’s whims, as seen in other FCA products.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Compass’ overall footprint is nearly as big as the larger Cherokee; the biggest difference between the two is that the Compass comes only with a four-cylinder engine. Inside, the Compass actually has more cargo room than the Cherokee: 27.2 cubic feet of room behind the backseat and 59.8 cubic feet with it folded. That’s almost 3 cubic feet more behind the backseat than the Cherokee has, and nearly 1 cubic foot more overall room. It’s still smaller than the Kia Sportage, though, which has 30.7 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 60.1 cubic feet. The spacious Honda CR-V is also bigger, with 39.2 cubic feet in back that’s expandable to 75.8 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nAlong with the new platform comes a host of safety upgrades for the Compass. Newly featured are forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking; lane departure warning and lane keep assist; blind spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection; and automatic distance-keeping cruise control with full autonomous stop. Also available are items like automatic parallel and perpendicular park assist, and trailer sway control for towing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPricing for the new Compass had not been released as of publication, but it is expected to be competitive with other vehicles in its class. And a crowded class that is: The compact SUV segment has seen massive growth in recent years.\n\nThe Compass will fill an interesting place in the Jeep showroom. It’s not as powerful as the V-6-optional Cherokee, but it’s marginally bigger inside and should be less expensive. It does allow for the next Cherokee to get a little bit bigger, further differentiating Jeep’s offerings.\n\nCompared with its competition, the Compass falls short in on-road drivability, seating utility and cargo room. It fares quite well, however, when compared on style, amenities, comfort and available safety systems. And it absolutely spanks every other compact competitor in off-road ability, but that’s a dubious victory in this class, where on-road behavior is, frankly, far more important.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Jeep Compass — especially in off-road-ready Trailhawk trim — has the potential to be one of the spiciest models in a bland compact SUV class, but with an anemic powertrain and embarrassing fuel economy, it has lost its way. \n\nVersus the competition: The Compass’ multimedia system is among the easiest to use in the class, but the SUV lags rivals in power, standard safety features and fuel economy.   \n\nThe Jeep Compass is in the popular and ever-expanding compact SUV class. It goes against the likes of the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4; see them compared. \n\nThe Compass comes in Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk trim levels. I tested the Trailhawk, and aside from its more aggressive styling (mine had a two-tone black and Spitfire Orange exterior), it’s loaded with off-road goodies: Trailhawks get a lifted suspension, off-road tires, skid plates, tow hooks, hill descent control and Jeep’s Active Drive Low four-wheel-drive system, which adds a low range.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV of 2019?\n\nThe Slow Lane\n\nIf you’re off-roading in a Compass Trailhawk, slow is your speed — and the Trailhawk delivers. Anyone not driving off-road will be left wanting: The sole engine is a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s adequate at best. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and six- and nine-speed automatics are available. My test model had the nine-speed and it was unpredictable, with shifts that were at times lazy and at other times hasty. At no time, however, were they smooth.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to take the Trailhawk off-road, but it proved to be comfortable on-road, with a compliant, bump-absorbent ride and clean, composed handling.\n\nIts road manners are fine overall, but its lack of character doesn’t help it stand out in the class. \n\nIts automatic engine stop-start system is a weak point, with rough and obtrusive shuddering on both shutdown and restart. Even more annoying is that it doesn’t appear to help in the fuel-economy department: In base front-wheel-drive guise with the six-speed automatic, the Compass is rated 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined — much lower than its competitors’ base front-drive versions: The Honda CR-V is rated 28/34/30 mpg, the Toyota RAV4 is 27/35/30 mpg and the Escape is 27/33/30 mpg. What’s more, these vehicles all offer some type of hybrid powertrain (hybrid or plug-in hybrid) for those who want even higher mileage; the Compass doesn’t.\n\nCabin Comforts \n\nThe Compass I drove had a cabin dressed in a sharp black and red leather combo, and everything felt appropriately cushy and padded. The front seat was comfortable for people, but once we were in there, our stuff didn’t fit; you’ll have to fight with your front passenger to store small items. There’s a small but deep center console storage box but no room under the controls to stash a phone. There are two teensy netted storage areas near each front occupant’s knees, but they’re not easy to reach.  \n\nThe highlight of the cabin is the Uconnect 4 touchscreen multimedia system, which has long been a favorite of ours for its large, clear screen and straightforward menus and controls. A 7-inch touchscreen is standard on the Compass; my car was equipped with the larger 8.4-inch screen. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard. The screen’s placement on the dash is easy to reach and one of the most drama-free systems I’ve used. The Uconnect 4 system has stayed current thanks to frequent updates, and another update is coming for the 2021 model year that will include wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  \n\nIn back, legroom is comfortable for two adults; by the numbers, the Compass is mid-pack in the segment with 38.3 inches of legroom. Rear headroom trails competitors slightly, but at 5 foot, 6 inches, I had ample space. Two car seats fit fine and were easy to install thanks to accessible lower Latch anchors.  \n\nBehind the backseat, there’s 27.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The opening is wide, but the amount of space falls well short of the CR-V (39.2), Escape (37.5) and RAV4 (37.6). The seats fold down in a 60/40 split to create 59.8 cubic feet of maximum space — again, much less than rivals. \n\nSafety and Value\n\nWhere it looks like the Compass stands out over the competition is in price, but that’s not exactly accurate. The 2020 Compass starts at $23,775, but that’s for a base model with a manual transmission. Most competitors come with standard automatics, and the Compass costs $27,120 when equipped that way (all prices include destination). The Escape starts at $26,130, the base CR-V at $26,270 and the base RAV4 at $27,125. \n\nSafety features are another caveat. For 2020, Jeep made more advanced safety features available on the base Sport trim level, but it didn’t go far enough. Many active safety features that are standard on other compact SUVs, such as the CR-V and RAV4, are still optional on the base Compass. If you want active safety features like automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning on a base Compass, you’ll have to opt for a $945 Advanced Safety Group option package. Blind spot monitoring is in a different safety package that costs an additional $945. \n\nThe Jeep Compass, especially in Trailhawk trim, has one of the most robust off-road setups in the compact SUV class. Only the Toyota RAV4 Adventure model can match it, but the RAV4 does many other things better than the Compass. And if you’re not looking to go off-road, the Compass’ weaknesses mount quickly. As competitors continue to add more standard safety features and increase fuel efficiency, it’s apparent the Compass needs to head in a new direction.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Jeep Compass: What’s Changed\nWhat Is Uconnect and Is Uconnect Worth It? \n2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee: What’s Changed\nWinter Is Coming and Jeep Is Ready\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
