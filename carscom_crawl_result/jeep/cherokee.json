      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Cherokee?\n\nThe Jeep Cherokee compact SUV has seating for five and comes standard with a 180-horsepower four-cylinder engine in the base Altitude Lux trim; a 270-hp turbo-four is in the range-topping Trailhawk. All-wheel drive is standard on both trims. The Cherokee comes standard with a wide range of comfort, tech and active safety features. While it’s excellent when it comes to venturing off-road, especially in the rugged Trailhawk trim, there’s no hiding the fact that the current Cherokee is roughly 10 years old and due for replacement. Rivals include the Ford Bronco Sport, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Cherokee?\n\nThe previously available 271-hp V-6 engine has been dropped, and Jeep has trimmed the Cherokee range to two trim levels: Altitude Lux and Trailhawk. With the previous base front-wheel-drive models no longer available, the Cherokee’s base price has risen considerably from the 2022 model year. AWD is now standard on every 2023 Cherokee, however, and newly standard features include leather seating and adaptive cruise control.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jeep Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSubscription-based Wi-Fi hot spot\nLeather seating\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFour USB ports\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nUnderbody skid plates (Trailhawk)\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nPanoramic moonroof\nLow-speed crawl mode\nAll-terrain tires\nNappa leather seating surfaces\nLocking rear differential\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Cherokee?\n\nThe 2023 Jeep Cherokee is probably best in its go-anywhere Trailhawk trim. It endows this compact SUV with all-terrain driving prowess that leaves most of the competition in the dust (or whatever type of terrain they happen to be traversing). While the level of standard equipment is high, so is the Cherokee’s base price, and cargo room ranks toward the bottom of the segment, too. A completely new Cherokee featuring some kind of fuel-saving electrified powertrain is likely coming next year.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nWe had our first chance to see the all-new 2026 Jeep Cherokee compact SUV in person.\nThe 2026 Cherokee is an all-new design that is the first Jeep in North America to use a traditional gas-electric hybrid powertrain.\nThe boxy design results in a comfortable interior with solid outward visibility, and the upscale interior is reminiscent of the Jeep Wagoneer S.\nWe’ll have to wait until we get to drive the new Cherokee to see how the hybrid performs.\n\nThe curtain lifted on the all-new 2026 Jeep Cherokee — with a new hybrid powertrain — back in August, and we recently got our first chance to see the new compact SUV in person at the 2025 edition of Chicago Drives Electric, a Chicago-area event for consumers who are curious about electrified vehicles, to see and test-drive the latest all-electrics, hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\n\nCars.com previously owned a 2014 Cherokee back when the Cherokee returned to Jeep’s North American lineup after a decade-plus hiatus. Our ownership experience was … not great. What about the all-new Cherokee?\n\nRelated: 2026 Jeep Cherokee Returns as High-Mileage Hybrid\n\nLess Polarizing Exterior\n\nTakeaways:\n\nThe 2026 Cherokee has a boxy exterior design that draws from the iconic XJ Cherokee of the ‘90s.\nIt’s less polarizing than the previous-generation Cherokee’s design.\nA large front air dam looks set to cause problems.\n\nWhen the previous-generation Cherokee debuted, opinions were mixed. I think the 2026 model looks like, well, a Jeep, which seems like it should be the goal for every model in the brand’s lineup. The 2026 design is said to be inspired by the boxy and iconic XJ Cherokee, and you can see that in its look, though the 2026 is also more rounded at the edges and more sculpted, likely to improve aerodynamic efficiency.\n\nTwo things stood out from my exterior inspection. First, the cargo load floor seemed low to me (I’m 6-foot-1), which would be helpful for those loading the Cherokee up with gear, pets, groceries or anything else. Second, the model on display had a large front air dam; we’ve had experience with these in some of our non-Jeep long-term test vehicles, and it’s been unfavorable. Jeep says the new Cherokee has 8 inches of ground clearance, but those looking to do off-roading with their Cherokee might want to consider removing the air dam ahead of leaving the pavement.\n\nFamiliar, Comfortable Interior\n\nTakeaways:\n\nMaterials quality and interior space both seem good for a compact SUV.\nSome controls felt a bit cheap, but this was a preproduction model.\nBeware of glare on the touchscreen, and the wide center console design may affect manspreaders.\n\nWe previously noted that the new Cherokee’s interior largely mimics the all-electric Wagoneer S, and that’s (mostly) not a bad thing. There’s ample room in the front and rear seats, though my knees were more elevated than I prefer when sitting in the back.\n\nAesthetically, the Cherokee’s interior is suitably stylish and upscale — important considering its roughly $37,000 starting price (all prices include destination) — and the gear selector knob has a premium feel to it. Other controls have a less-than-premium feel, however, though that may be because this was a preproduction model. The large controls on the squircle-shaped steering wheel and the climate-control bar are single pieces; when I pushed a specific function, the entire piece moved. Materials seem fine for the class and maybe even a little upscale (which makes sense with pricing starting at around $37,000 and going up to $46,000), but we’ll wait for a production version to confirm quality.\n\nAbout that squircle-shaped steering wheel: Some of the editors here, including myself, find that shape a bit frustrating to use. The positive here is that, from the driver’s seat, it appeared perfectly formed to allow me to see the digital instrument panel.\n\nThere were some potential issues in the interior. The angled center touchscreen looks just as susceptible to glare as touchscreens we’ve seen in other Jeeps, and the grated design on the top of the dashboard can be reflected in the windshield, which could be distracting while driving. The wide center console design may also cut into knee room for the driver and front passenger.\n\nMore News From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Hybrid Vehicles Have All-Wheel Drive?\n2026 Toyota RAV4 Goes All-Hybrid, Gets Upgraded Tech\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nWhich Compact SUV Has the Best Real-World MPG?\nWhich Compact SUV Has the Most Cargo Room?\nHow Will It Drive?\n\nTakeaways:\n\nThe biggest question mark is how the new Cherokee drives.\nJeep estimates the Cherokee will achieve 37 mpg combined.\n\nCompetition in the compact SUV class is always fierce, and with a new Toyota RAV4 arriving soon, it will likely only intensify. Jeep claims the 2026 Cherokee will achieve an estimated 37 mpg combined, which would be competitive with some of the most popular hybrid compact SUVs currently on sale. We’ll have to wait and see if it can deliver that kind of efficiency, as well as what it’s like to drive, so stay tuned for more. The upscale Limited and Overland trims should go on sale late in the year, with the base and Laredo versions following in early 2026.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The release of an all-new Jeep model is not an everyday occurrence. The radical-looking 2014 Cherokee, which replaces the Liberty, has a simple formula: It looks crazy on the outside and upscale on the inside, makes the most of its interior space and has perfectly acceptable on-road performance and mileage.\n\nThe fact that a version of the 2014 Jeep Cherokee can handle extreme off-roading is a bonus, but everyday drivers will find the well-rounded new model a tough crossover to pass over.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nWhile the Jeep Cherokee’s price puts it up against the entire compact crossover class, at 182 inches in length it’s sized between the likes of Honda’s CR-V and Ford’s Escape, both of which come in at roughly 178 inches in length, and Chevrolet’s Equinox, at 187.8 inches. See the Cherokee compared side-by-side against key competitors here.\n\nPerformance\nDuring a day of testing, I drove the new Cherokee on twisty mountain roads and pockmarked streets, as well as a brief highway stint, and it performed about as well as any SUV in the class. Sandwiched between that testing were a few hours of slow-speed rock-climbing and off-road trails in Moab, Utah, renowned for its adventurous terrain.\n\nThere are two engine options: the standard 184-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and an optional 271-hp, 3.2-liter V-6. Both are teamed to a 9-speed automatic transmission, a first for Jeep and its Chrysler parent.\n\nI tested both in a variety of trim levels and found the 2.4-liter to be competent but a bit slow, while the V-6 was impressive and had me pushing it as fast as allowable.\n\nUnfortunately, it will be the four-cylinder that most shoppers settle on. I was able to test the engine only in the off-road-focused Trailhawk trim level, which is the worst-case scenario for acceleration. The Trailhawk’s extra equipment adds significant weight, even compared with an all-wheel-drive non-Trailhawk trim, let alone a front-wheel-drive model.\n\nWeight was definitely an issue during my test on surface streets. The four-cylinder Trailhawk lumbered from a dead stop and had trouble accelerating up inclines, uttering unpalatable groans as it went. At highway speeds, however, passing maneuvers were adequate, and the Jeep Cherokee didn’t seem underpowered.\n\nThe V-6 is another story entirely. The Trailhawk V-6 accelerated through the mountains with little struggle, kicking down a gear aggressively when needed, and didn’t make me think the added four-wheel drive and off-road equipment was a hindrance.\n\nOnce I shed the Trailhawk’s heavy equipment for a Limited and its simpler all-wheel drive, low-rolling-resistance tires and lower ride height, the V-6 Jeep Cherokee felt like a different car — sporty and exceptionally fast on the open road.\n\nThe 9-speed transmission felt relatively ordinary, certainly not extraordinary versus a continuously variable transmission or more common six-speed automatic. Shifts weren’t whip fast in the four-cylinder model, and with the V-6 I wasn’t able to shift among the higher gears manually. Jeep representatives say that the manual feature only allows for shifts within a threshold of maximum efficiency.\n\nAll versions of the Cherokee I tested handled well in corners, with crisp steering. There was some body lean on the tightest corners, but nothing beyond what the rest of this class exhibits in similar scenarios.\n\nThe Jeep Cherokee is nevertheless heavier than most other compacts by 200 pounds in some cases; it is nearly 100 pounds lighter than the Equinox.\n\nSo while the four-cylinder engine’s specs compare favorably with smaller crossovers, it is definitely at a disadvantage due to its weight. The four-cylinder Equinox similarly lacks thrills in the acceleration department.\n\nFuel ratings for the entire Cherokee lineup have not been released yet, but the all-wheel-drive version of the four-cylinder is rated at 21 mpg city, 28 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined. Those numbers come in behind all-wheel-drive versions of the CR-V, Subaru Forester and RAV4 but ahead of the Equinox.\n\nThere aren’t many V-6 options in the class, and the Cherokee surpasses the Chevy with a more fun-to-drive experience; it’s neck and neck with the Escape’s sprightly, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.\n\nFuel economy for the all-wheel-drive versions of the V-6 Jeep Cherokee are rated at 19 mpg city, 27 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. Again, that bests the V-6 version of the Equinox while coming in behind the turbocharged four-cylinder options of the Escape and Forester.\n\nOff-Road Performance\nThis being a new Jeep, the company wanted to make sure journalists put the Trail Rated Trailhawk version through a trail worthy of the badge. That we did.\n\nI took both the four-cylinder and V-6 Trailhawks through more than an hour of trails made of sand, rock and obscenely large rocks that were unlike any off-roading I had done before. Incline grades of well more than 30 degrees were common, and the Trailhawk handled them just fine as long as I exhibited deft control of the accelerator.\n\nThere aren’t rock rails on the Trailhawk, which would add even more weight, and a few “crunches” were heard. They can be added as a dealer accessory. Some journalists’ vehicles showed slight signs of damage along the front lower bumper.\n\nThe fact that an automaker’s vehicles can take on such challenges to earn a “trail rating” isn’t that significant. It’s when a relatively untrained driver can step into a Cherokee Trailhawk, drive it for just an hour or so on the road and then simply take it up the side of a giant boulder without any alteration to the vehicle, even tire pressure, that I sit in awe.\n\nThe Cherokee is available with three all-wheel-drive systems (which Jeep calls 4×4 in traditional fashion): Jeep Active Drive I, Jeep Active Drive II and Jeep Active Drive Lock for the Trailhawk models. All three feature selectable terrain modes, and the Active Drive Lock adds more modes for off-road situations, like sand and rock.\n\nIt’s likely that serious off-roaders will still frown upon the Jeep Cherokee. They see nothing wrong with the Wrangler and its even more capable nature. The Trailhawk Cherokee will likely be sold to outdoorsy types looking for a little extra capability. And let’s be honest; some people are going to buy it just for the looks.\n\nInterior\nThere’s no denying the Cherokee is a polarizing car to look at from the outside. It has stirred debate on our site for months. But inside there’s nothing that should cause controversy.\n\nIf anything, the Jeep Cherokee’s interior is perhaps Chrysler’s best-executed one to date. The materials in even the second-tier Latitude trim level were top-notch for the class. The look and padding of the dash are beyond what you find in a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, while the overall design of the interior is stylish instead of rugged.\n\nTouches of metallic flash exude luxury, and in fact nothing inside really speaks to this being a Jeep in the traditional sense. There was no attempt to make the inside look like it belongs in a military vehicle.\n\nBeyond the design, the seats are comfortable, the backseat roomy for the class at 40.3 inches of rear legroom, and all the controls are laid out in the straightforward fashion we’ve come to appreciate in other new Chrysler products, like the Dodge Dart and the latest Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nCargo\nWhere the Cherokee comes up short against the competition is in cargo space. Even with the sliding second row moved to its forward-most position, cargo volume is rated at 29.7 cubic feet. That’s less than the Equinox, at 31.5 cubic feet, as well as the Subaru Forester at 33.5, Escape at 34.3, CR-V at 37.2 and RAV4 at 38.4 cubic feet. \n\nWith the rear 60/40-split seats folded, the Cherokee’s cargo volume extends to 54.9 cubic feet, again slightly behind the Equinox, at 63.7 cubic feet, but farther behind the rest of the field.\n\nI still think most shoppers will find the cargo area spacious enough for most needs, and there is enough space for a full-size spare tire under the floor on Trailhawk models. The 4×4 versions of the other trims get a compact spare, while the rest get a large storage compartment underneath along with a tire inflator kit.\n\nThere’s also a standard cargo management system that features a rail installed on the side of the cargo area that serves as an attachment point for hooks and other items shoppers can buy through the dealer, like removable grocery bags, a cargo bin, a cooler, a first aid kit and an off-road accessory kit for Trailhawk models.\n\nI’m not sure many people will take advantage of this system, but I have de facto “storage” bags in my own wagons at home that prove invaluable. The Cherokee’s look much nicer.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe 2014 Jeep Cherokee comes relatively well-equipped at a starting price of $23,990, including destination, for the 4×2 and $25,990 for the 4×4. That gets you the base Sport trim with cloth seats and 17-inch steel wheels, as well as a six-speaker stereo with a 5-inch touch-screen, Bluetooth and USB.\n\nMost buyers will opt for the Latitude model, which is next up the chain at $25,490 and adds more content. The Limited has even more convenience features, while the Trailhawk is the “performance” model. You can see a detailed explanation of features and trim prices here.\n\nSafety\nAs an all-new model, the Cherokee has not yet been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Cherokee comes with 10 standard airbags including driver and front passenger knee bolster airbags. The rear seats also have side, seat-mounted airbags as well as curtain airbags.\n\nThere are a number of optional active safety systems, like lane departure warning, forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection.\n\nCherokee in the Market\nThe ability of the Jeep Cherokee to scale a small mountain/very large boulder won’t be tested every day, but it does cement the slick crossover as a Jeep in capability as well as in name.\n\nIgnore that ability, and you’re still left with one of the most competitive crossovers on the market in terms of price and features. We’ll see how many people fall for the looks, because that’s one of the few X factors on one well-executed car.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Consolidation to four total trims for 2022, starting with the new base X; base 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine dropped; Uconnect 4C with 8.4-inch touchscreen standard; additional standard equipment for Latitude Lux\n\nPricing: The 2022 Cherokee starts at $35,590 for an X or Latitude Lux model, a significant $6,105 increase over the base 2021 starting price for an erstwhile Latitude trim with front-wheel drive. Prices for the Trailhawk and Limited trims increase slightly for 2022.\n\nOn sale: Now, with X trim arriving later in 2022\n\nWhich should you buy, 2021 or 2022? Shoppers looking for the most affordable Cherokee should look for a 2021; prices are up for 2022 on the base model, but you also get more features, including a standard V-6 engine. Those shopping for higher trims may also want to consider a model-year 2021 since prices are also up, but not as significantly.\n\nJeep’s Cherokee SUV sees some minor changes for 2022, including a trim level shake-up that moves the Latitude Lux to the base trim instead of 2021’s Latitude. In addition, there’s more standard equipment for the Latitude Lux and the Uconnect system with the 8.4-inch touchscreen is now standard; the 2021 base model used a 7-inch display.\n\nRelated: 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review: Grander Across the Board\n\nFor 2022, the new Cherokee X trim joins the lineup. It adds more rugged-looking graphics outside as well as upgraded cloth and vinyl seats with a trim-specific pattern inside. The X has standard four-wheel drive, rides on a 1-inch-taller suspension and uses the 3.2-liter V-6 engine. Also new for 2022, the base Latitude Lux trim gets additional standard equipment such as a power liftgate, 7-inch color display, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a 115-volt power outlet.\n\nThe 2022 Jeep Cherokee in base Latitude Lux with front-wheel drive trim and the V-6 engine starts at $35,590, a significant $6,105 increase over the 2021’s $29,485 starting price for a lower Latitude trim with FWD and the previous base four-cylinder engine (prices include a $1,595 destination).\n\nThat base 2.4-liter four-cylinder has been dropped entirely for 2022. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is an additional $695 across the lineup. For 2022, the Latitude Lux is the only model with FWD; 4WD costs an additional $1,500.\n\nThe new Cherokee X trim, like the Latitude Lux, starts at $35,590. The 4WD-only Trailhawk trim starts at $38,640, up slightly from 2021’s $38,135. At the top of the list, the 4WD-only Limited starts at $40,340, also more than a model-year 2021 Limited 4WD’s $38,935 price.\n\nThe 2022 Jeep Cherokee is on sale now; Jeep said the new X trim will be out later.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\nLife With the Jeep Grand Cherokee: What Do Owners Really Think?\nLoaded 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Vs.

      "expert_review": "When it made its debut in 1984, the Jeep Cherokee was in a class by itself. It was the only four-door sport utility vehicle.\n\nFast forward to 1997 and the Cherokee is surrounded by usurpers to the throne. But one drive in a 1997 Cherokee will convince you that the others are merely traveling a well-worn path.\n\nStill, even a pioneer needs a new set of duds now and then. For 1997, Chrysler has shed some of the gremlins built into the vehicle by Jeep’s former owner, AMC. That means a smoother one-piece grille up front and rounded-off front quarter panels. The vent windows have been banished to the scrap heap of history. The back end gets a new look as well, giving it a family resemblance to its bigger sibling, the Grand Cherokee.\n\nUnless you own one, you’ll be hard-pressed to spot the exterior changes. Instead, take a peek inside.\n\nHere, where a square dash once faced the driver, a new contemporary dash resides, with fewer sharp corners. That 1976-era interior is gone.\n\nThe center of the dash, housing radio and climate controls, now bulges forward in a manner more akin to the Jeep Wrangler. The door trim gracefully resembles the Grand Cherokee, as does the center console. The dash also gets a passenger-side air bag, which joins the driver’s side air bag added in 1995.\n\nOnly a current owner would appreciate other changes, such as an improved ventilation system, new electrical systems, and improvements to overall refinement.\n\nChrysler also claims to have upped build quality, although the test vehicle had a non-functioning CD player and a center console that never latched as tightly as it should have. But there were no squeaks and rattles, and otherwise this Jeep performed superbly.\n\nThank the gutsy 4.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine for that. This power plant delivers 190 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque. This optional engine is a far better choice than the standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine — 125 horsepower isn’t enough for this rig.\n\nWhat makes this old vet so appealing is that, despite the leather seating surfaces, you never forget this is a truck. That honest character is evident from the engine’s roar to the truck-like ride. You won’t forget that this is a JEEP.\n\nYet there’s enough civility and manners to make it tolerable. The numb steering is relatively quick. Combined with the Cherokee’s compact size, that makes this vehicle a fun one to scoot around town in. You never feel like you’re in a bus or van.\n\nIt only sounds that way. The Cherokee isn’t the quietest in its class, either, but again, this gives the vehicle character, setting it apart from its overly mannered competitors. This is a truck.\n\nThe spare tire eats up some cargo space and there’s no cargo cover. But there is sufficient space for most hauling chores. The rear seat folds to accommodate long cargo, but it’s a one-piece unit, not split.\n\nThe Cherokee gets points not only f or having a muscular drive train and feel, but a price tag that’s closer to terra firma.\n\nThere are three trim levels: bottom-level SE, mid-level Sport and top-notch Country. SE and Sport are available in both two- and four-door models. A 2WD two-door SE starts at slightly less than $16,000. The cheapest 4WD four-door starts at $18,375. The test vehicle was a four-door, 4WD Country with a base price of $23,420. That’s a lot less than most competing models for a real 4WD vehicle that will get you through anything at any time.\n\nThe only thing competitors can’t copy is the Jeep’s value and feel for the money. Standard: 4.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine, four-speed automatic transmission, dual air bags, Command-Trac part-time shift-on-the-fly 4WD system, power steering, front and rear stabilizer bars, roof rack, P225/70R15 tires with aluminum wheels, reclining front bucket seats, folding rear seat, wood-grain accents, four-speaker AM-FM stereo-cassette, consol with cup holders and storage bin, intermittent wipers, rear window wiper-washer with intermittent and defogger, spare tire cover, floor mats, light group, cargo tie-down loops. Optional: Leather-vinyl seats, Country Package 26H (air conditioning, tilt wheel, cruise control), trailer tow group, Up Country Suspension (Trac-Lok Differential, P225 OWL A/ T Tires, full-size spare, skid plates, tow hooks, special shock absorbers, heavy-duty radiator), for-wheel anti-lock brakes, overhead console, Select Trac full-time 4WD, dual heated mirrors, fog lamps, upgraded stereo, CD player. Base price: $23,420 As tested: $27,920 EPA rating: 15 mpg city, 21 mpg highway Test mileage: 16 mpg",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2014 Jeep Cherokee. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model.

The radical-looking 2014 Cherokee, which replaces the Liberty, has a simple formula: It looks crazy on the outside and upscale on the inside, makes the most of its interior space and has perfectly acceptable on-road performance and mileage.\n\nThe fact that a version of the 2014 Jeep Cherokee can handle extreme off-roading is a bonus, but everyday drivers will find the well-rounded new model a tough crossover to pass over.\n\nWhile the Cherokee’s price puts it up against the entire compact crossover class, at 182 inches in length it’s sized between the likes of Honda’s CR-V and Ford’s Escape, both of which come in at roughly 178 inches in length, and Chevrolet’s Equinox, at 187.8 inches. See the Cherokee compared side-by-side against key competitors here.\n\nPerformance\nDuring a day of testing, I drove the new Cherokee on twisty mountain roads and pockmarked streets, as well as a brief highway stint, and it performed about as well as any SUV in the class. Sandwiched between that testing were a few hours of slow-speed rock-climbing and off-road trails in Moab, Utah, renowned for its adventurous terrain.\n\nThere are two engine options: the standard 184-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and an optional 271-hp, 3.2-liter V-6. Both are teamed to a nine-speed automatic transmission, a first for Jeep and its Chrysler parent.\n\nI tested both in a variety of trim levels and found the 2.4-liter to be competent but a bit slow, while the V-6 was impressive and had me pushing it as fast as allowable.\n\nUnfortunately, it will be the four-cylinder that most shoppers settle on. I was able to test the engine only in the off-road-focused Trailhawk trim level, which is the worst-case scenario for acceleration. The Trailhawk’s extra equipment adds significant weight, even compared with an all-wheel-drive non-Trailhawk trim, let alone a front-wheel-drive model.\n\nWeight was definitely an issue during my test on surface streets. The four-cylinder Trailhawk lumbered from a dead stop and had trouble accelerating up inclines, uttering unpalatable groans as it went. At highway speeds, however, passing maneuvers were adequate, and the Cherokee didn’t seem underpowered.\n\nThe V-6 is another story entirely. The Trailhawk V-6 accelerated through the mountains with little struggle, kicking down a gear aggressively when needed, and didn’t make me think the added all-wheel drive and off-road equipment was a hindrance.\n\nOnce I shed the Trailhawk’s heavy equipment for a Limited and its simpler all-wheel drive, low-rolling-resistance tires and lower ride height, the V-6 Cherokee felt like a different car — sporty and exceptionally fast on the open road.\n\nThe nine-speed transmission felt relatively ordinary, certainly not extraordinary versus a continuously variable transmission or more common six-speed automatic. Shifts weren’t whip fast in the four-cylinder model, and with the V-6 I wasn’t able to shift among the higher gears manually. Jeep representatives say that the manual feature only allows for shifts within a threshold of maximum efficiency.\n\nAll versions of the Cherokee I tested handled well in corners, with crisp steering. There was some body lean on the tightest corners, but nothing beyond what the rest of this class exhibits in similar scenarios.\n\nThe Cherokee is nevertheless heavier than most other compacts by 200 pounds in some cases; it is nearly 100 pounds lighter than the Equinox.\n\nSo while the four-cylinder engine’s specs compare favorably with smaller crossovers, it is definitely at a disadvantage due to its weight. The four-cylinder Equinox similarly lacks thrills in the acceleration department.\n\nFuel ratings for the entire Cherokee lineup have not been released yet, but the all-wheel-drive version of the four-cylinder is rated at 21 mpg city, 28 mpg highway and 24 mpg combined. Those numbers come in behind all-wheel-drive versions of the CR-V, Subaru Forester and RAV4 but ahead of the Equinox.\n\nThere aren’t many V-6 options in the class, and the Cherokee surpasses the Chevy with a more fun-to-drive experience; it’s neck and neck with the Escape’s sprightly, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder.\n\nAll-wheel-drive versions of the V-6 Cherokee are rated at 19 mpg city, 27 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. Again, that bests the V-6 version of the Equinox while coming in behind the turbocharged four-cylinder options of the Escape and Forester.\n\nOff-Road Performance\nThis being a new Jeep, the company wanted to make sure journalists put the Trail Rated Trailhawk version through a trail worthy of the badge. That we did.\n\nI took both the four-cylinder and V-6 Trailhawks through more than an hour of trails made of sand, rock and obscenely large rocks that were unlike any off-roading I had done before. Incline grades of well more than 30 degrees were common, and the Trailhawk handled them just fine as long as I exhibited deft control of the accelerator.\n\nThere aren’t rock rails on the Trailhawk, which would add even more weight, and a few “crunches” were heard. They can be added as a dealer accessory. Some journalists’ vehicles showed slight signs of damage along the front lower bumper.\n\nThe fact that an automaker’s vehicles can take on such challenges to earn a “trail rating” isn’t that significant. It’s when a relatively untrained driver can step into a Cherokee Trailhawk, drive it for just an hour or so on the road and then simply take it up the side of a giant boulder without any alteration to the vehicle, even tire pressure, that I sit in awe.\n\nThe Cherokee is available with three all-wheel-drive systems (which Jeep calls 4×4 in traditional fashion): Jeep Active Drive I, Jeep Active Drive II and Jeep Active Drive Lock for the Trailhawk models. All three feature selectable terrain modes, and the Active Drive Lock adds more modes for off-road situations, like sand and rock.\n\nIt’s likely that serious off-roaders will still frown upon the Cherokee. They see nothing wrong with the Wrangler and its even more capable nature. The Trailhawk Cherokee will likely be sold to outdoorsy types looking for a little extra capability. And let’s be honest; some people are going to buy it just for the looks.\n\nInterior\nThere’s no denying the Cherokee is a polarizing car to look at from the outside. It has stirred debate on our site for months. But inside there’s nothing that should cause controversy.\n\nIf anything, the Cherokee’s interior is perhaps Chrysler’s best-executed one to date. The materials in even the second-tier Latitude trim level were top-notch for the class. The look and padding of the dash are beyond what you find in a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, while the overall design of the interior is stylish instead of rugged.\n\nTouches of metallic flash exude luxury, and in fact nothing inside really speaks to this being a Jeep in the traditional sense. There was no attempt to make the inside look like it belongs in a military vehicle.\n\nBeyond the design, the seats are comfortable, the backseat roomy for the class at 40.3 inches of rear legroom, and all the controls are laid out in the straightforward fashion we’ve come to appreciate in other new Chrysler products, like the Dodge Dart and the latest Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nCargo\nWhere the Cherokee comes up short against the competition is in cargo space. Even with the sliding second row moved to its forward-most position, cargo volume is rated at 29.7 cubic feet. That’s less than the Equinox, at 31.5 cubic feet, as well as the Subaru Forester at 33.5, Escape at 34.3, CR-V at 37.2 and RAV4 at 38.4 cubic feet.\n\nWith the rear 60/40-split seats folded, the Cherokee’s cargo volume extends to 54.9 cubic feet, again slightly behind the Equinox, at 63.7 cubic feet, but farther behind the rest of the field.\n\nI still think most shoppers will find the cargo area spacious enough for most needs, and there is enough space for a full-size spare tire under the floor on Trailhawk models. The 4×4 versions of the other trims get a compact spare, while the rest get a large storage compartment underneath along with a tire inflator kit.\n\nThere’s also a standard cargo management system that features a rail installed on the side of the cargo area that serves as an attachment point for hooks and other items shoppers can buy through the dealer, like removable grocery bags, a cargo bin, a cooler, a first aid kit and an off-road accessory kit for Trailhawk models.\n\nI’m not sure many people will take advantage of this system, but I have de facto “storage” bags in my own wagons at home that prove invaluable. The Cherokee’s look much nicer.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe 2014 Cherokee comes relatively well-equipped at a starting price of $23,990, including destination, for the 4×2 and $25,990 for the 4×4. That gets you the base Sport trim with cloth seats and 17-inch steel wheels, as well as a six-speaker stereo with a 5-inch touch-screen, Bluetooth and USB.\n\nMost buyers will opt for the Latitude model, which is next up the chain at $25,490 and adds more content. The Limited has even more convenience features, while the Trailhawk is the “performance” model. You can see a detailed explanation of features and trim prices here.\n\nSafety\nAs an all-new model, the Cherokee has not yet been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Cherokee comes with 10 standard airbags including driver and front passenger knee bolster airbags. The rear seats also have side, seat-mounted airbags as well as curtain airbags.\n\nThere are a number of optional active safety systems, like lane departure warning, forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection.\n\nCherokee in the Market\nThe ability of the Cherokee to scale a small mountain/very large boulder won’t be tested every day, but it does cement the slick crossover as a Jeep in capability as well as in name.\n\nIgnore that ability, and you’re still left with one of the most competitive crossovers on the market in terms of price and features. We’ll see how many people fall for the looks, because that’s one of the few X factors on one well-executed car.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Jeep’s flagship, the Grand Cherokee Limited, drives like a tall-riding luxury sedan, is loaded with creature comforts and has one whale of a V8 engine.\n\nIn a time when buyers seem to snap up all the luxury SUVs automakers can build, the Limited has glove-soft leather seats, wood trim and an automatic dual-zone climate control on top of an off-road pedigree that gives it serious off-road capability.\n\nRealistically, not many owners soil their Grand Cherokee in off-road excursions, and I don’t blame them. It’s too nice, and too expensive, to knock around even though it is capable of performing quite well in the rough. Back in 1999, when this model was first introduced to journalists, I drove one over a very rugged off-road course and it was most impressive.\n\nThe heart of the Limited is the SOHC, 4.7-liter V8 with the soul of a sports car and the obseqiousness of a maitre d’. This engine is as smooth as frozen yogurt, yet when called upon, it can flex its muscles impressively. One weekend I drove the test car to a friend’s country cabin, and the brawny V8 absolutely shined on two-lane highways. I passed slow-moving 18-wheelers in the blink of an eye, courstesy of the 235 horsepower.\n\nFor 2001, Jeep has added a five-speed automatic transmission whose extra gear allows more relaxed highway cruising. Because it was quiet on the highway, I could easily hear the rear axle whine, and that was bothersome after a while. I have heard about this from other Jeep owners, too.\n\nAnother new item for 2001 is a hydraulic cooling system that replaces electric and mechanical fans. This is a first for a DaimlerChrysler vehicle, and it results in improved air conditioning and a quieter idle.\n\nThe test vehicle was equipped with Jeep’s Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system that uses a speed-sensitive, torque-transfer system that allows drive to be distributed from front to rear or from side to side, as conditions require, with no driver involvement. Quadra-Drive will pull the vehicle when only one wheel has grip.\n\nWhen Jeep redesigned the Grand Cherokee for 1999, it kept the same 105.9-inch wheelbase but made the vehicle taller, longer and wider. The spare tire was mounted under the rear floor and that freed up interior space. There is more hip room in the back seat and back doors are wider, too.\n\nThe second seat has new child-seat tether anchorages. No third seat is available, but Automotive News reports one will be offered on a future model. The lack of a third seat could be a negative when most of the competition has one.\n\nInside, ergonomics and aesthetics are quite good. The Limited has light-faced gauges that look sporty and are easy to read. Auxiliary switches and controls are grouped logically and are easy to reach. The radio is mounted up high in the center of the instrument panel, and climate controls are similar to those from the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid.\n\nThe dual-zone climate contr ol system uses infrared sensors to measure the air around the driver and passenger, and temperature adjustments are then made accordingly.\n\n“His” and “her” keys are linked to memory functions so that unlocking the vehicle automatically sets seats, mirrors and radio to one person’s preferences. There are 13 functions that the driver can program simply using the overhead console.\n\nMuted colors and soft textures throughout the interior mimic those of a luxury sedan.\n\nIn urban driving, handling is quite good. The ride is smooth and compliant and corners are dispatched without excessive body lean. The 17-inch wheels enhance grip and look great.\n\nThe brakes, with 12-inch rotors and an integrated anti-lock system, are powerful enough to stop strongly.\n\nFor those who tow, the 2001 has a standard connector under the instrument panel for use with aftermarket electric trailer brakes, and a wiring pigtail is packaged with the trailer towing option.\n\nIt’s true hat the Grand Cherokee Limited is a pricey package, but then so are most of its comparably equipped competitors. The Jeep shines in three areas: The engine’s power is pleasing, it looks terrific and the interior is as well-finished as a luxury sedan.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the Grand Cherokee Limited was $35,095. Options included AM/FM/cassette player with 10-disc CD changer, Quadra-Drive, power 10-way heated seats, 17-inch wheels, Up Country suspension and the five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe sticker price was $38,230.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Grand Cherokee Limited has the style and panache of a luxury sedan and the rugged pedigree of a serious off-roader. It looks great, has a smooth and powerful 4.7-liter V8 engine and is loaded with creature comforts.\n\nCounterpoint: Compared to competing SUVs, the Grand Cherokee is not as big inside as some of its competitors, and there is no optional third seat as yet.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 4.7-liter V8\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nFour-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 105.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,134 lbs.\n\nBase price: $35,095\n\nAs driven: $38,230\n\nMpg rating: 14 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "A no-frills, four-cylinder Jeep Cherokee SE has all the appeal of a well-worn pair of hiking boots: Fancy it isn’t, but when you hit the trail there’s nothing else like it. Plus, it won’t wreck your wallet.\n\nIt’s somewhat ironic that the original Cherokee, which bowed in 1984, has been engulfed by the sport-utility vehicle (SUV) boom it helped create. Today’s SUVs are bigger, softer, more civilized; as cozy as a campfire and as comfy as your favorite chair. Most live in suburbia where they serve as family transport, and few turn a wheel off-road. The Cherokee, while updated last year with a new dash and other refinements, remains true to its roots as a rugged, functional vehicle that puts utility ahead of fashion, and that is clearly evident in the basic model I drove. Purists will prefer it for its simplicity.\n\nIt was refreshing to slide behind the wheel of a four-wheel-drive SUV that costs less than $20,000, has room for four people and gets reasonable gas mileage. It’s true that crank windows aren’t that handy, and manual door locks make it easy to leave a door unlocked by accident, but value-conscious customers will appreciate what they get for their dollar.\n\nThe 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine is adequate for chugging around town or puttering off-road. It only makes 125 horsepower, and if you want to do some towing it isn’t big enough, but it has a city rating of 18 mpg. You can keep up with traffic as long as you make good use of the manual gearbox, which is not the easiest to shift. The engine is fairly noisy and the transmission whines considerably, reminding the driver that this vehicle is much closer to a truck than a car.\n\nThat can be felt easiest on the highway, where the noise level rises in proportion to your speed. At 70 mph it lets you know that you are going fast enough.\n\nWhile the optional three-speed automatic transmission would be quieter, it can only be ordered on four-cylinders with two-wheel drive.\n\nUsing four-wheel drive is simple: Yank the floor-mounted lever into four-wheel high or four-wheel low gear.\n\nLast year the Cherokee’s interior was revamped to accomodate dual airbags, which means it got a new dash. The instruments in our test vehicle were as basic as the rest of it. There were only two dials, a speedometer and fuel gauge, and both were about the same size. Everything else is handled with a warning light, which makes it hard to know when the water is warm enough to turn the heater on. With the transmission in fifth gear the shift lever blocks the heater’s temperature control knob.\n\nThe front seats offer moderate support. They are separated by a console with dual cupholders and an ashtray. Room in front is not generous, but adequate.\n\nIn back, things are a bit tighter. Passengers have to wriggle through narrow doors and over the back wheels to get in. Once seated, legroom is limited because of the 101.4-inch wheelbase. The short wheelbase, on the other hand, enhances off-road mobility, so the trade-off is yours to make.\n\nOf course, the back seat folds down, but the full-size spare intrudes on cargo space.\n\nIf a flat black grille, steel wheels and manual window cranks means less to you than a sub-$20,000 price (with air conditioning and AM/FM cassette), and if you want an SUV that has genuine off-road capability, then Jeep’s Cherokee SE deserves a look. It may be an old shoe, but it has a lot of trails left in it.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $17,990. Options included air conditioning, power mirrors, rear washer/wiper, roof rack, rear defroster, AM/FM cassette, limited-slip differential and skid plate group.\n\nThe sticker price was $19,625.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Cherokee SE is plain, simple and effective It holds four people, can travel off-road and is priced at less than $20,000.\n\nCounterpoint: The manual gearbox and small four-cylinder engine are fairly noisy and the back seat is snug.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, 4-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 101.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,181 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $17,990\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $19,625\n\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 20 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe vehicle that most in the auto industry credit with starting the stampede to SUVs gains a handful of styling tweaks for the top-of-the line model. The design for the Cherokee dates to 1984, when it was downsized and introduced as the first modern compact sport utility. Cherokee received a major update in 1997, but the basic design remained intact.\n\nProduction of the current Cherokee was scheduled to end in November 2000 to make way for a new 2001 model, but strong sales in 1999 earned the current model a new lease on life. Jeep will continue building the current Cherokee for the 2001 model year, and it will be sold alongside the new model for an unspecified period.\n\nInterior\nCherokee holds five people, though the rear seat is cramped compared to some rivals’ and the narrow rear doors can be tight for adults to negotiate. The spare tire is mounted upright in the cargo area, eating up some luggage space. An outside tire carrier is available from Jeep dealers, but then there is the theft potential.\n\nExterior\nCherokee comes in two- and four-door styling, with the latter far more popular. The top-line Limited model gets chrome grille and headlamp accents, new side trim and bright silver 16-inch wheels.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAn inline 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 125 horsepower remains the base engine, and an inline 4.0-liter six-cylinder with 190 horsepower is optional. Cherokee comes with 2WD, part-time 4WD (slippery surfaces only) or full-time 4WD (can be used on smooth, dry pavement).\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "American Motors Corp., or AMC as it was known, usually was good for a laugh, as evidenced by the fact that this is the outfit that brought out the Gremlin and Pacer, a pair of styling oddities.\n\nGremlin, you may recall, was designed on the back of an airline burp bag by AMC’s chief stylist Richard Teague, which caused some to joke that the amiable Teague could have put the bag to better use.\n\nAMC was the minority member of what then was called the Big Four, which was abbreviated to the Big Three when Chrysler purchased the tiny automaker in 1987 to acquire the Jeep line of sport-utility vehicles. It was one of then Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca’s finest moments-entry to the sport-utility market without having to spend the time or money to design, develop and build one from scratch. With Jeep he had an instant rival to Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Bronco (which would become the Bronco II and, finally, the Explorer).\n\nJeep, together with Iacocca’s other stroke of genius, the mini-van, allowed the once struggling Chrysler to fill its coffers to overflowing.\n\nIacocca is gone, but the Jeep Cherokee is still around and will continue in its present form until the 1997 model year. Time not only heals all wounds, it allows an automaker to amortize its costs. Not fooling with Cherokee sheet metal is one reason the vehicle has been so profitable for Chrysler. But some say Cherokee has been around a bit too long in its present form. We agree.\n\nIn the 1993 model year, Chrysler brought out the Grand Cherokee, a larger, more stylish member of the Jeep family, but chose to keep the older, smaller Cherokee as a price leader-a wise move, especially considering a Grand Cherokee can set you back $30,000 or more.\n\nWe test drove a 1995 Jeep Cherokee Sport, and age has obviously caught up with it-a box in a world of balloons, square lines instead of rounded ones.\n\nOn the open highway you’ll get buffeted when the breeze slaps against those square slab sides. Cherokee’s chief rivals, Blazer and Explorer, feature rounded edges that slip through the turbulence; Cherokee bounces around in it.\n\nCherokee features a 4-liter, 190-horsepower, inline 6-cylinder engine compared with a 4.3-liter, 190-h.p., V-6 at Chevy, a 4-liter, 160-h.p., V-6 at Ford. The Chevy engine is peppier, and Chevy and Ford V-6s are quieter than the in-line Chrysler 6.\n\nOur test vehicle was equipped with a 5-speed manual, the trans of choice if you do a lot of off-roading. A 4-speed automatic will run $897.\n\nRather than push-button four-wheel-drive, as in Blazer and Explorer, our vehicle required pulling on a transfer case lever, another reminder of its age.\n\nIn the early days of sport-utility vehicles, owners didn’t expect a utility to coddle them like a Lincoln because, after all, these were built off truck platforms.\n\nTo today’s sport-utility buyer, it ‘s a substitute for a sedan or coupe and rarely, if ever, leaves the pavement. He or she demands car-like ride and handling.\n\nThe Cherokee Sport comes with large P225/75R15 tires that are designed to look sporty but tend to have a mind of their own at speed and in corners. You feel as if the tires have lifted the vehicle’s center of gravity a bit higher than you’d like for total stability.\n\nBowing to the demand for safety, Cherokee offers a driver-side air bag as standard. No passenger-side bag is available, however. Anti-lock brakes are offered-as an $595 option.\n\nFour-wheel-drive, of course, means never having to stay home when the roads are covered with goop. You’ll probably be able to count on your thumbs how often you use 4WD, but having it provides a great deal of assurance.\n\nWith age, of course, comes wrinkles that need to be smoothed out when that all-new 1997 Cherokee appears. Those wrinkles include the parking brake handle, which r sts in the center console, robbing you of storage room; and a regular-size spare tire in the rear, eating up cargo room.\n\nAnother annoyance is the confusing power-window buttons on the driver’s door panel that, in the dark, can have you opening every window but the right one.\n\nYet another grievance is that in keeping with the square design, the windows open on a horizontal plane from the top, not in an arc from the front, as in aero-styled vehicles. That means more wind noise and trouble for those who smoke. An ash flicked from the top of the window often blows back into the cabin. Cherokee has a side vent, but it’s a decoration.\n\nThe Cherokee Sport starts at $18,606. Standard equipment includes power brakes and steering, front and rear stabilizer bars as well as front and rear gas-filled shocks, 20.2-gallon fuel tank, dual manual mirrors, all-terrain 15-inch tires, AM/FM stereo and clock, tinted glass, trip odometer, childproof rear door locks and intermittent wipers.\n\nCherokee may be a price leader, but you’ll have to load it with options to get the common conveniences such as air conditioning and power windows and locks.\n\nOur tester started at $18,606 but topped $22,000 with options that excluded ABS and automatic transmission, which would have added $1,492 more to the sticker.\n\nAt $22,000 to $23,000, Cherokee might be a way to avoid a $30,000 to $32,000 Grand Cherokee, but you’d have to seriously consider the Blazer, with better ride and handling, peppier engine, quieter operation, increased room and comfort and more modern styling, or Explorer, which may be lacking in performance, but does have standard dual air bags.\n\n>> 1995 Jeep Cherokee 4WD Sport Wheelbase: 101.4 inches Length: 166.9 inches Engine: 4-liter, 190-h.p., inline 6-cylinder Transmission: 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic optional EPA mileage: 17 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway Base price: $18,606 Add $1,469 for sport option package consisting of air conditioning, tilt steering, center floor console, rear wiper/washer, roof rack, leather-wrapped steering wheel and front floor mats (sport option?); $582 for power windows/door locks and keyless entry; $203 for overhead console; $285 for locking differential; $122 for dual electric mirrors; $110 for fog lamps; $201 for AM/FM with cassette; $116 for spare tire cover; $245 for aluminum wheels; $72 for cargo area cover shade and $495 for freight; bringing total to $22,506. Strong points: Driver-side air bag standard. Four-wheel ABS available as an option, four-wheel-drive security. Weak points: Not exactly a cheap Jeep after you add the options. ABS runs $595, automatic transmission $897. Only a driver-side air bag. Sheet metal in need of surgery and square body means wind gusts will buffet ve hicle. Full size spare in rear eats into cargo room. Confusing control button layout for power windows. Parking brake handle lies in center console to cheat storage space. Oversized tires result in some ride wobble. >>",

      "expert_review": "We had high hopes for the 2019 Jeep Cherokee. We’re very fond of it overall — in spite of the fact that after a year’s ownership of a 2014 model, we unanimously concluded that we wouldn’t buy another. Somehow, our affection for the Cherokee was strong enough that we were able to overlook the engine replacement it mysteriously required; what we couldn’t overlook was the bad behavior of its only transmission, a nine-speed automatic — especially when paired with the base 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Despite numerous changes to its programming both in our early model and in subsequent model years, the transmission would hesitate too long when a downshift was called for. (At least the hard upshifts improved somewhat over the years.)\n\nThe 2019 Cherokee has a few things going for it, starting with its first substantial refresh since 2014, which is an opportunity to make improvements. On the flip side, the Jeep Compass was completely redesigned for 2017 and was a disappointment, partly due to the same transmission. The 2019 Cherokee could go either way. How did Jeep do?\n\nOne Step Forward, Technically\n\nBoth of the 2019 Cherokees we drove, a Trailhawk and an Overland, were equipped with an engine that’s new to the lineup: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Its 270 horsepower rating is 1 hp lower than the V-6 that’s standard in these two high trim levels, but it has more torque — and it’s accessible at lower engine speeds: a peak of 295 pounds-feet at 3,000 to 4,500 rpm, versus the 3.2-liter Pentastar V-6’s 239 pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm. The difference is very noticeable in off-the-line starts, and the transmission lag is somewhat better.\n\nMore power and torque tend to make automatics perform better, primarily because they don’t have to downshift as frequently in order to make the vehicle step out, and downshifting is where transmissions usually introduce lag. But this nine-speed’s lag problem is far from cured by the new engine; it’s merely less frequent and less noticeable at lower speeds. It’s enough better that you can drive normally and not even notice it — until you attempt a passing maneuver at highway speeds and find yourself waiting a staggering 2 to 3 seconds for the Cherokee to accelerate after you floor the pedal.\n\nThe efficiency goal has produced some frustrating transmissions of late, and we can’t say we’re fans of the droning sounds or so-so responsiveness of continuously variable automatic transmissions, which competitors like Subaru and Honda use, but that doesn’t excuse the Cherokee’s gearbox. CVTs have improved over time and the Tiguan’s conventional eight-speed, to cite one example, does a fine job. All vehicles must pass the stomp-and-go test, and the Cherokee’s lag tests the limits of what’s safe and reasonable.\n\nAs I laid out in our Edge of Glory article, this nine-speed transmission is supplied by Germany’s ZF, and though it works well enough when teamed with the larger 3.6-liter V-6 in our Best of 2017 Chrysler Pacifica, it drags down several lower-powered models from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other automakers, including Honda and Jaguar Land Rover.\n\nYou’ll have to decide if the transmission is a deal-breaker for you regardless of the engine you prefer. The new turbo power plant absolutely helps, but you’ll pay for it: Optional on all trim levels but the base Latitude, it’s a $2,245 option versus the standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder, more expensive than the V-6, which is $1,745 on the Latitude through Limited FWD versions. The turbo is a $500 option on trim levels that include the V-6 standard. Another strike against it: Though the turbo can run on regular gasoline, it prefers 91-octane premium for its rated output and mileage. Also note that the turbo four, when equipped with the Trailer Tow Package, raises the Cherokee’s towing capacity from 2,000 to 4,000 pounds, but the V-6 is still tops at 4,500 pounds.\n\nThe cost of premium gas undermines the turbo engine’s otherwise decent EPA-estimated mileage of 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive. The combined figure drops to 24 mpg with the simplest of the three four-wheel-drive systems the Cherokee offers, Active Drive I, and to 23 mpg with Active Drive II, which adds a low gear for off-roading; further off-road enhancements for the Trailhawk trim lower its combined estimate to 22 mpg. For comparison, the V-6 engine is rated 23, 22, 21 and 21 mpg combined, respectively. The base four-cylinder is rated 25 mpg combined with FWD and 24 mpg combined with Active Drive I.\n\nHow the Cherokee’s mileage compares to competitors depends on how you classify it. Its base trim is priced to compete with compact SUVs, but it’s almost 10 inches longer than Jeep’s version of a compact, the Compass. It’s wider than the 2018 Subaru Forester and Outback and the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, which is among the larger compact competitors, but the Outback and Tiguan are both several inches longer than the Cherokee.\n\nThe Forester carries an EPA rating of 28 mpg combined with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and 25 mpg with a turbocharged 2.0-liter. The Outback is also rated 28 mpg combined with the 2.5-liter and 22 mpg with a 3.6-liter six-cylinder. (Both Subarus have standard all-wheel drive.) The Tiguan is rated 24 mpg combined with front-wheel drive and 23 mpg with AWD on regular gas; stepping up to the Limited trim shaves 1 mpg off both ratings and requires premium.\n\nPeerless Off-Roading\n\nWhere the Cherokee has no peers in its price class is its off-road capability, which is best realized in the Trailhawk trim level. It combines different front and rear bumpers — for improved approach and departure angles — with Active Drive Lock 4WD (which is Active Drive II four-wheel drive plus a locking rear differential) and Selec-Terrain traction modes including Auto, Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock.\n\nI tested the Cherokee Trailhawk alongside Jeep’s ultimate off-roader, the redesigned 2018 Wrangler Rubicon, and the Cherokee can go almost anywhere the Wrangler can. Its approach and departure angles aren’t as steep (though its breakover angle is better than the four-door Wrangler’s), and the Cherokee Trailhawk’s 8.7-inch ground clearance doesn’t match the Rubicon’s 10.8 inches, but just the fact that the two can be compared shows how far ahead of direct competitors the Cherokee is. Foundationally, the Wrangler’s use of solid front and rear axles allows for more wheel articulation and more assured traction than the Cherokee’s four-wheel independent suspension, but the latter provides better on-road performance.\n\nSo Much Good\n\nThe Cherokee’s transmission stands out as such an Achilles heel because the model is otherwise so good. It rides comfortably and handles well enough (few compact SUVs stand out for sportiness). It’s reasonably quiet, though the off-road tires of the Trailhawk trim are noticeable, as were the relatively aggressive Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza Plus tires on our Overland. The brakes feel strong and linear on both application and release.\n\nJeep made a few upgrades to the cabin for 2019, such as more piano-black finishes and a larger bin at the front of the center console, but very little needed attention. The touchscreens are well-executed, starting with a 7-inch display in the Latitude trim level and stepping up to an 8.4-inch version, with or without built-in navigation, in higher trims. The new fourth-generation Uconnect adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility regardless of screen size. Our test models had the 8.4-inch touchscreen, which remains among the best systems on the market for controlling various aspects of the vehicle. Android Auto was super buggy for me, but we’ve found these glitches to depend as much or more on the make, model and operating system of the phone attached as they do the vehicle in question. By the time we returned the Cherokee, an app update had already improved performance somewhat.\n\nEase of use is no small feat in today’s cars, and it’s one of the Cherokee’s strengths. In addition to the favorable Uconnect, the dashboard has simple mechanical buttons and knobs and is gloriously free of touch-sensitive panels, remotely positioned control interfaces and other such claptrap. The only shortcoming of the traditional PRND gear selector lever is that it’s connected to such a disappointing gearbox. One of the Cherokee’s triumphs is that there’s nothing flat-out stupid about it. That’s how low the bar can be these days.\n\nAs in other areas, the Cherokee’s cabin dimensions are somewhere between compact and mid-size. According to the specifications, it has more front legroom than the Tiguan but less than the Forester and Outback, yet it has at least a couple of inches more backseat legroom than those models (see them compared) as well as the mid-size Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and large-compact Nissan Rogue (see them compared). Having a split, folding backseat that can be adjusted forward and back is another benefit in the Cherokee, as it allows you to give more space to occupants or to cargo based on your need.\n\nAgain, by the numbers, the Cherokee has less backseat headroom than the other models mentioned except the Rogue, which it equals, but at 6 feet tall, I was perfectly comfortable back there despite the presence of a headroom-robbing panoramic moonroof.\n\nModest Cargo Space\n\nJeep scooped out the walls of the cargo area for 2019, adding more than 3 inches of width and 1.2 cubic feet overall, but cargo volume isn’t the model’s strongest suit. Bearing in mind that the sliding backseat grants flexibility and seems to favor the backseat legroom specification detailed above, the Cherokee’s 25.8 cubic feet of volume behind the backseat trails the Forester (34.4 cubic feet), Outback (35.5), Santa Fe Sport (35.4), Rogue (39.3) and Tiguan (33 cubic feet behind the second row).\n\nRemoving the backseat from the equation, the Cherokee’s maximum, seats-folded volume is 54.9 cubic feet; most other models provide 70 cubic feet or more. Raise the cargo floor and you’ll find a few inches’ more depth even with the temporary spare tire in place. Overall, the relatively high cargo area is well-designed and versatile, but its size is no leader even among compact competitors. The Compass is larger at 27.2 and 59.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and maximum, respectively.\n\nSafety Questions\n\nAs of publication, the refreshed 2019 Cherokee had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though the organization plans a test for sometime this summer. The earlier generation earned a disappointing score of marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the driver-side small overlap front crash test, which was its only substandard rating and definitely below average among competitors. Jeep says it has made changes that could improve the 2019’s score, but we won’t know until test results are posted. Look for the 2019 Cherokee on the Institute’s mid-size SUVs page in place of the 2018 report.\n\nThe Cherokee’s safety report card is otherwise very good. It now offers a slew of advanced safety and driver-assist features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control that works down to a stop, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring with cross-traffic detection, rain-sensing wipers, automatic high-beams and active parallel/perpendicular parking assist. Unfortunately, the optional Technology Group that includes these features isn’t available on Latitude trim levels. A backup camera is standard.\n\nThe 2019 Cherokee also earned straight A’s for child-safety seat accommodation, a rarity even among large five-seat SUVs. See the details in our Car Seat Check. For offspring of driving age, the subscription-based Family Connect can alert parents if the driver exceeds preset speed, curfew or geographic limitations.\n\nAbout the Styling …\n\nI’m one of the few oddballs who liked the old Cherokee’s oddball styling, which positioned bright LED daytime running light eyebrows up high and headlights rather low, where people didn’t realize that’s what they were. I was in the minority, and Jeep not only resisted extending this design to other models but has abandoned it altogether with the 2019 Cherokee, which now groups the DRLs and standard LED headlights higher up in more conventional clusters. (Hyundai has already adopted this design — less deftly, if you ask me — in the Kona and redesigned 2019 Santa Fe.) Additionally, the waterfall grille that formerly began above a crease in the leading edge of the hood and then cascaded down — you know, like a waterfall — now has a more conventional look on a more vertically oriented nose.\n\nI admit this design will appeal to more shoppers, and it looks fine on the Trailhawk version of the Cherokee with its gray bumper, but to me, the body-colored versions look doctored rather than holistic, with a too-broad swath of bumper where the headlights once were. That’s my parting shot.\n\nHonor Student Breaks Bad\n\nIn addition to all the other upsides, the Cherokee is built in the U.S. in Belvidere, Ill., and the 2018 model ranked No. 1 on the Cars.com American-Made Index. (The 2019’s rank will depend both on its criteria and the rest of the 2019 field, to be determined in June 2019.) If we seem overly harsh about the Cherokee’s transmission, it’s for the same reason you’re hard on an honor student who does something really stupid: It’s otherwise really, really good. I believe that someday this transmission will be abandoned, and industry folk who are currently mum will talk openly about it as a known problem that couldn’t be replaced quickly enough. Or maybe the same will be said about me and my animosity toward this gearbox. But my money’s still on the ZF nine-speed dying a welcome and overdue death first. It’s 2018; we can do better, and many transmissions do.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Life is good at Jeep. An all-SUV brand at a time when interest in SUVs is surging, Jeep is stocked for the hot small SUV segment with the likes of the subcompact Renegade, the redesigned Compass compact SUV and the Cherokee, which is on the larger end of the compact SUV spectrum. Cherokee competitors include the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue; see their specs compared here. \n\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the Cherokee — which returned to the Jeep lineup in its current form as a 2014 model — was highly polarizing when it debuted due to its radical styling. It was such an intriguing vehicle that Cars.com decided to buy one as a long-term test car, and we spent the next year reporting on our experiences with it.\n\nThe 2017 Cherokee starts at $24,790 for a front-wheel-drive Sport trim level. Our top-of-the-line Overland test vehicle, however, cost considerably more. It came with the 3.2-liter V-6 engine; a more sophisticated four-wheel-drive system with a selectable Low range; active safety and off-road features; an upscale interior with a leather-wrapped dashboard; Berber floormats; and heated and ventilated leather front seats. The as-tested price was $41,975.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe Cherokee is a good example of how designs tend to seem less extreme the more you see them. Apart from the seven grille slats that are a Jeep hallmark, the Cherokee’s face was different from everything else in the lineup when it debuted — and it still is today. With thin LED running lights perched above the headlights, there’s still an edginess to the Cherokee’s design, but it’s become familiar to the point that it’s no longer jarring when you see one on the road.\n\n$$IMAGE-2,3,4,5,$$\n\nHowever, it doesn’t appear that the Cherokee is going to usher in a new look for the Jeep brand; it’s the only model that’s adopted such a radical aesthetic. The Renegade’s front end is comparatively traditional, and the redesigned Compass takes after the popular Grand Cherokee.\n\nDriving It\n\nAutomatic transmissions aren’t typically a deal-breaker, but the Cherokee’s nine-speed automatic transmission had a detrimental effect on our long-term Cherokee’s driving experience — so much so that many editors, myself included, wouldn’t buy it again. Our long-term tester had the base four-cylinder engine, but after testing other Cherokees with the optional V-6 — including this one — it’s become clear that it’s better suited to the nine-speed automatic.\n\nStill, there are shortcomings. For one, the transmission still suffers from sometimes-clunky responses, particularly when shifting from Park or Reverse into Drive. This is something modern automatic transmissions just don’t do anymore with any regularity, which is why it sticks out here.\n\nA big problem with early versions of the nine-speed was its tendency to lunge from 2nd to 3rd gear with an unrefined shift. That wasn’t evident in this Overland model, which shifted smoothly for the most part, but the transmission is intent on keeping engine rpm low. It’s good for gas mileage but not for when you need more power, like when passing at highway speeds.\n\nThe 271-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6 is a refined, strong engine that accelerates the Cherokee easily. Yet even with nine forward gears to work with, gas mileage isn’t great: With the Overland’s optional low-range four-wheel-drive system, it’s rated 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The same engine with the base four-wheel-drive system is rated 23 mpg combined. The all-wheel-drive four-cylinder Cherokee is rated as high as 21/28/23 mpg. Popular compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 get up to 27/33/29 mpg and 22/28/25 mpg, respectively, with all-wheel drive, but both are powered by four-cylinder engines and don’t offer a V-6.\n\nThree four-wheel-drive systems are available: Jeep Active Drive I, Jeep Active Drive II and Jeep Active Drive Lock. Jeep Active Drive I is a single-speed system, while Jeep Active Drive II includes a Neutral setting in addition to a low range. Jeep Active Drive Lock is only available for the Trailhawk trim level, where it adds a mechanically locking rear axle and a Rock mode for the Selec-Terrain system.\n\nEven though our Cherokee Overland test car had the low-range four-wheel-drive system and various skid plates to protect vulnerable components off-road, it was civilized on the street. The ride is firm but comfortable, and though you feel bumps and other road imperfections, the suspension manages them in a refined way that’s as good as what you get in many luxury-badged compact SUVs.\n\nInterior\n\nEven in lower trim levels, the Cherokee has a nice interior, with materials that lend a high-quality look. The Overland steps things up by adding luxury features such as a leather dashboard, a heated wood and leather steering wheel, and perforated Nappa leather upholstery.\n\n$$IMAGE-6,7,8,9,10,11,12,$$\n\nLike the Honda CR-V, the Cherokee’s cabin is roomy. Front-seat comfort and space are good for taller drivers, and the backseat is very spacious for adults, with legroom and headroom to spare. Rear-seat thigh support is also good, and the seat slides forward and backward and reclines.\n\nIt’s easy to get in and out of the Cherokee, too; even though it’s an SUV, you step down when getting in as opposed to stepping up.\n\nJeep’s Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system is optional. The system has easy-to-use menus and a line of system-selection icons at the bottom of the screen. It’s easy to pair your phone using Bluetooth, and the screen responds quickly to selections. It also works when you’re wearing gloves.\n\nCertain versions of Uconnect 8.4 come with a built-in navigation system. It works fine and includes traffic data, but the map graphics look too low-tech for an embedded system. The onscreen image from the optional backup camera is similarly unimpressive; it’s low-resolution and looks blurry.\n\nAt the same time, traditional (but still useful) interfaces have been preserved. There are big volume and tuning knobs, and the secondary climate controls below the screen are nice to have if you’d rather not use the screen to control the ventilation system.\n\n$$IMAGE-13,14,$$\n\nThe Cherokee’s cargo area measures 24.6 cubic feet with the rear seat up and at its rearmost position, and there’s 54.9 cubic feet of space when the rear seat is folded flat and level with the cargo floor. Both the CR-V and RAV4 have more cargo room: The CR-V has 39.2 cubic feet with the backseat up and 75.8 when it’s folded, while the RAV4 has 38.4 cubic feet behind the backseat and 73.4 when it’s folded.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Cherokee its top crash-test rating, good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal and poor), in all tests but the difficult small-overlap front crash test, where it received a marginal rating. The IIHS has also rated the Cherokee’s optional collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, judging it superior — the highest rating possible.\n\nOther available active safety features include a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning and prevention. Lane departure prevention is active at midrange speeds and will gently steer you back to the center of your lane if it senses you’ve drifted toward lane markings without signaling.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nFrom its refined ride and upscale interior to its easy-to-use multimedia system, the Cherokee has a lot going for it in a competitive part of the SUV market. The nine-speed automatic transmission, however, remains this SUV’s biggest weak spot — especially when paired with the standard four-cylinder engine. The $1,745 V-6 helps with some but not all of the transmission’s issues.\n\nBut there’s a bigger issue here: When you can’t realistically consider a car’s base drivetrain because of how poorly it performs, as I can’t with the Cherokee, can you trust other versions of it? Even though the V-6 Cherokee drives better, there are still too many issues for me to say yes.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We had high hopes for the 2019 Jeep Cherokee. We’re very fond of it overall — in spite of the fact that after a year’s ownership of a 2014 model, we unanimously concluded that we wouldn’t buy another. Somehow, our affection for the Cherokee was strong enough that we were able to overlook the engine replacement it mysteriously required; what we couldn’t overlook was the bad behavior of its only transmission, a nine-speed automatic — especially when paired with the base 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Despite numerous changes to its programming both in our early model and in subsequent model years, the transmission would hesitate too long when a downshift was called for. (At least the hard upshifts improved somewhat over the years.)\n\nThe 2019 Cherokee has a few things going for it, starting with its first substantial refresh since 2014, which is an opportunity to make improvements. On the flip side, the Jeep Compass was completely redesigned for 2017 and was a disappointment, partly due to the same transmission. The 2019 Cherokee could go either way. How did Jeep do?\n\nOne Step Forward, Technically\n\nBoth of the 2019 Cherokees we drove, a Trailhawk and an Overland, were equipped with an engine that’s new to the lineup: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Its 270 horsepower rating is 1 hp lower than the V-6 that’s standard in these two high trim levels, but it has more torque — and it’s accessible at lower engine speeds: a peak of 295 pounds-feet at 3,000 to 4,500 rpm, versus the 3.2-liter Pentastar V-6’s 239 pounds-feet at 4,400 rpm. The difference is very noticeable in off-the-line starts, and the transmission lag is somewhat better.\n\nMore power and torque tend to make automatics perform better, primarily because they don’t have to downshift as frequently in order to make the vehicle step out, and downshifting is where transmissions usually introduce lag. But this nine-speed’s lag problem is far from cured by the new engine; it’s merely less frequent and less noticeable at lower speeds. It’s enough better that you can drive normally and not even notice it — until you attempt a passing maneuver at highway speeds and find yourself waiting a staggering 2 to 3 seconds for the Cherokee to accelerate after you floor the pedal.\n\nThe efficiency goal has produced some frustrating transmissions of late, and we can’t say we’re fans of the droning sounds or so-so responsiveness of continuously variable automatic transmissions, which competitors like Subaru and Honda use, but that doesn’t excuse the Cherokee’s gearbox. CVTs have improved over time and the Tiguan’s conventional eight-speed, to cite one example, does a fine job. All vehicles must pass the stomp-and-go test, and the Cherokee’s lag tests the limits of what’s safe and reasonable.\n\nAs I laid out in our Edge of Glory article, this nine-speed transmission is supplied by Germany’s ZF, and though it works well enough when teamed with the larger 3.6-liter V-6 in our Best of 2017 Chrysler Pacifica, it drags down several lower-powered models from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other automakers, including Honda and Jaguar Land Rover.\n\nYou’ll have to decide if the transmission is a deal-breaker for you regardless of the engine you prefer. The new turbo power plant absolutely helps, but you’ll pay for it: Optional on all trim levels but the base Latitude, it’s a $2,245 option versus the standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder, more expensive than the V-6, which is $1,745 on the Latitude through Limited FWD versions. The turbo is a $500 option on trim levels that include the V-6 standard. Another strike against it: Though the turbo can run on regular gasoline, it prefers 91-octane premium for its rated output and mileage. Also note that the turbo four, when equipped with the Trailer Tow Package, raises the Cherokee’s towing capacity from 2,000 to 4,000 pounds, but the V-6 is still tops at 4,500 pounds.\n\nThe cost of premium gas undermines the turbo engine’s otherwise decent EPA-estimated mileage of 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive. The combined figure drops to 24 mpg with the simplest of the three four-wheel-drive systems the Cherokee offers, Active Drive I, and to 23 mpg with Active Drive II, which adds a low gear for off-roading; further off-road enhancements for the Trailhawk trim lower its combined estimate to 22 mpg. For comparison, the V-6 engine is rated 23, 22, 21 and 21 mpg combined, respectively. The base four-cylinder is rated 25 mpg combined with FWD and 24 mpg combined with Active Drive I.\n\nHow the Cherokee’s mileage compares to competitors depends on how you classify it. Its base trim is priced to compete with compact SUVs, but it’s almost 10 inches longer than Jeep’s version of a compact, the Compass. It’s wider than the 2018 Subaru Forester and Outback and the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, which is among the larger compact competitors, but the Outback and Tiguan are both several inches longer than the Cherokee.\n\nThe Forester carries an EPA rating of 28 mpg combined with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and 25 mpg with a turbocharged 2.0-liter. The Outback is also rated 28 mpg combined with the 2.5-liter and 22 mpg with a 3.6-liter six-cylinder. (Both Subarus have standard all-wheel drive.) The Tiguan is rated 24 mpg combined with front-wheel drive and 23 mpg with AWD on regular gas; stepping up to the Limited trim shaves 1 mpg off both ratings and requires premium.\n\nPeerless Off-Roading\n\nWhere the Cherokee has no peers in its price class is its off-road capability, which is best realized in the Trailhawk trim level. It combines different front and rear bumpers — for improved approach and departure angles — with Active Drive Lock 4WD (which is Active Drive II four-wheel drive plus a locking rear differential) and Selec-Terrain traction modes including Auto, Snow, Sport, Sand/Mud and Rock.\n\nI tested the Cherokee Trailhawk alongside Jeep’s ultimate off-roader, the redesigned 2018 Wrangler Rubicon, and the Cherokee can go almost anywhere the Wrangler can. Its approach and departure angles aren’t as steep (though its breakover angle is better than the four-door Wrangler’s), and the Cherokee Trailhawk’s 8.7-inch ground clearance doesn’t match the Rubicon’s 10.8 inches, but just the fact that the two can be compared shows how far ahead of direct competitors the Cherokee is. Foundationally, the Wrangler’s use of solid front and rear axles allows for more wheel articulation and more assured traction than the Cherokee’s four-wheel independent suspension, but the latter provides better on-road performance.\n\nSo Much Good\n\nThe Cherokee’s transmission stands out as such an Achilles heel because the model is otherwise so good. It rides comfortably and handles well enough (few compact SUVs stand out for sportiness). It’s reasonably quiet, though the off-road tires of the Trailhawk trim are noticeable, as were the relatively aggressive Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza Plus tires on our Overland. The brakes feel strong and linear on both application and release.\n\nJeep made a few upgrades to the cabin for 2019, such as more piano-black finishes and a larger bin at the front of the center console, but very little needed attention. The touchscreens are well-executed, starting with a 7-inch display in the Latitude trim level and stepping up to an 8.4-inch version, with or without built-in navigation, in higher trims. The new fourth-generation Uconnect adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility regardless of screen size. Our test models had the 8.4-inch touchscreen, which remains among the best systems on the market for controlling various aspects of the vehicle. Android Auto was super buggy for me, but we’ve found these glitches to depend as much or more on the make, model and operating system of the phone attached as they do the vehicle in question. By the time we returned the Cherokee, an app update had already improved performance somewhat.\n\nEase of use is no small feat in today’s cars, and it’s one of the Cherokee’s strengths. In addition to the favorable Uconnect, the dashboard has simple mechanical buttons and knobs and is gloriously free of touch-sensitive panels, remotely positioned control interfaces and other such claptrap. The only shortcoming of the traditional PRND gear selector lever is that it’s connected to such a disappointing gearbox. One of the Cherokee’s triumphs is that there’s nothing flat-out stupid about it. That’s how low the bar can be these days.\n\nAs in other areas, the Cherokee’s cabin dimensions are somewhere between compact and mid-size. According to the specifications, it has more front legroom than the Tiguan but less than the Forester and Outback, yet it has at least a couple of inches more backseat legroom than those models (see them compared) as well as the mid-size Hyundai Santa Fe Sport and large-compact Nissan Rogue (see them compared). Having a split, folding backseat that can be adjusted forward and back is another benefit in the Cherokee, as it allows you to give more space to occupants or to cargo based on your need.\n\nAgain, by the numbers, the Cherokee has less backseat headroom than the other models mentioned except the Rogue, which it equals, but at 6 feet tall, I was perfectly comfortable back there despite the presence of a headroom-robbing panoramic moonroof.\n\nModest Cargo Space\n\nJeep scooped out the walls of the cargo area for 2019, adding more than 3 inches of width and 1.2 cubic feet overall, but cargo volume isn’t the model’s strongest suit. Bearing in mind that the sliding backseat grants flexibility and seems to favor the backseat legroom specification detailed above, the Cherokee’s 25.8 cubic feet of volume behind the backseat trails the Forester (34.4 cubic feet), Outback (35.5), Santa Fe Sport (35.4), Rogue (39.3) and Tiguan (33 cubic feet behind the second row).\n\nRemoving the backseat from the equation, the Cherokee’s maximum, seats-folded volume is 54.9 cubic feet; most other models provide 70 cubic feet or more. Raise the cargo floor and you’ll find a few inches’ more depth even with the temporary spare tire in place. Overall, the relatively high cargo area is well-designed and versatile, but its size is no leader even among compact competitors. The Compass is larger at 27.2 and 59.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and maximum, respectively.\n\nSafety Questions\n\nAs of publication, the refreshed 2019 Cherokee had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though the organization plans a test for sometime this summer. The earlier generation earned a disappointing score of marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the driver-side small overlap front crash test, which was its only substandard rating and definitely below average among competitors. Jeep says it has made changes that could improve the 2019’s score, but we won’t know until test results are posted. Look for the 2019 Cherokee on the Institute’s mid-size SUVs page in place of the 2018 report.\n\nThe Cherokee’s safety report card is otherwise very good. It now offers a slew of advanced safety and driver-assist features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control that works down to a stop, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring with cross-traffic detection, rain-sensing wipers, automatic high-beams and active parallel/perpendicular parking assist. Unfortunately, the optional Technology Group that includes these features isn’t available on Latitude trim levels. A backup camera is standard.\n\nThe 2019 Cherokee also earned straight A’s for child-safety seat accommodation, a rarity even among large five-seat SUVs. See the details in our Car Seat Check. For offspring of driving age, the subscription-based Family Connect can alert parents if the driver exceeds preset speed, curfew or geographic limitations.\n\nAbout the Styling …\n\nI’m one of the few oddballs who liked the old Cherokee’s oddball styling, which positioned bright LED daytime running light eyebrows up high and headlights rather low, where people didn’t realize that’s what they were. I was in the minority, and Jeep not only resisted extending this design to other models but has abandoned it altogether with the 2019 Cherokee, which now groups the DRLs and standard LED headlights higher up in more conventional clusters. (Hyundai has already adopted this design — less deftly, if you ask me — in the Kona and redesigned 2019 Santa Fe.) Additionally, the waterfall grille that formerly began above a crease in the leading edge of the hood and then cascaded down — you know, like a waterfall — now has a more conventional look on a more vertically oriented nose.\n\nI admit this design will appeal to more shoppers, and it looks fine on the Trailhawk version of the Cherokee with its gray bumper, but to me, the body-colored versions look doctored rather than holistic, with a too-broad swath of bumper where the headlights once were. That’s my parting shot.\n\nHonor Student Breaks Bad\n\nIn addition to all the other upsides, the Cherokee is built in the U.S. in Belvidere, Ill., and the 2018 model ranked No. 1 on the Cars.com American-Made Index. (The 2019’s rank will depend both on its criteria and the rest of the 2019 field, to be determined in June 2019.) If we seem overly harsh about the Cherokee’s transmission, it’s for the same reason you’re hard on an honor student who does something really stupid: It’s otherwise really, really good. I believe that someday this transmission will be abandoned, and industry folk who are currently mum will talk openly about it as a known problem that couldn’t be replaced quickly enough. Or maybe the same will be said about me and my animosity toward this gearbox. But my money’s still on the ZF nine-speed dying a welcome and overdue death first. It’s 2018; we can do better, and many transmissions do.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just one week after the updated 2019 Jeep Cherokee made its debut at the 2018 Detroit auto show, I got the chance to get behind the wheel to see how those changes translate to the road.\n\nRelated: Jeep Puts Best Face Forward With 2019 Cherokee Redesign\n\nOur preview has a more detailed rundown of the 2019 Cherokee’s changes, which are comprehensive. The exterior styling has been reworked to make the Cherokee appear more conventionally Jeep-esque, similar to the Compass and Grand Cherokee. There is also updated technology, improved cabin materials and a brand-new optional engine.\n\nThe changes are nice, but what held the previous model back in my mind was value. It was just too expensive to compete with like-sized and -featured competitors. Along with a chance to get behind the wheel, Jeep also announced pricing for the Cherokee’s five trim levels (Latitude, Latitude Plus, Limited, Overland and Trailhawk).\n\nEngine Upgrade\n\nThe Cherokee’s most exciting addition is under the hood. Joining the two carryover engines from last year is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (out of the Alfa Romeo Giulia) that makes 270 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The other two engines are a 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder making 171 pounds-feet of torque and a 271-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 making 239 pounds-feet of torque. All three engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nJeep has greatly expanded the Cherokee’s engine availability for 2019: The 2.4-liter four-cylinder serves as the base engine for the Latitude, Latitude Plus and front-wheel-drive versions of the Limited. The V-6 is optional on all those trim levels and standard on the all-wheel-drive Limited, Overland (4×2 and 4×4) and Trailhawk. And the new turbocharged four-cylinder is optional on all trim and drivetrain configurations except for the Latitude.\n\nI drove models with the V-6 and the turbo-four, and there was a stark difference between the two. The torque advantage of the turbo-four is apparent; it’s much quicker and more responsive than the V-6 (which admittedly felt muted to me when I drove it in the previous-generation Cherokee as well).\n\nIt’s too bad that the transmission doesn’t keep up with the engine; the nine-speed is a wet blanket and forms a fun-barrier between the driver and the quick acceleration the engine is capable of providing. After a year of 2014 Cherokee ownership by Cars.com, it was the balky transmission that soured our staff on the model, though it was clear the base four-cylinder was part of the problem and the V-6 made the transmission at least tolerable.\n\nThe transmission, combined with a good amount of body roll and fairly numb steering, prevent the Cherokee from being a solid on-road performer (a la the Mazda CX-5). I’d rate it as par for the course in this vehicle class.\n\nHowever, take things off-road…\n\nStill Good Off-Road\n\nThe Trailhawk trim level still exists for those who demand more off-road capability of the Cherokee. It is the only one of the Cherokee’s trim levels to earn a “Trail Rated” designation and the only one with standard all-wheel drive. Jeep offers three different AWD systems for the Cherokee: Active Drive I; Active Drive II, which adds a low-range gear; and the Trailhawk-exclusive Active Drive Lock, which adds an electronic locking rear differential. Trailhawks also sit an inch higher than the other trim levels, have additional underbody protection and get red tow hooks and a hood decal.\n\nJeep set up an off-road course as a part of our testing, which included rock climbing, controlled ascents and descents over loose surfaces, a mud pit and a grooved section that put different wheels in the air so show how the AWD could move power around. The Trailhawk is truly ahead of the rest of the pack of compact SUVs; it can make it through rough terrain that competitors wouldn’t dare to even look at.\n\nThe Selec-speed control system, which works for both ascents and descents, is also impressive. You can engage the system, select a speed with the shifter and the Cherokee works out the rest — only the steering is left to you.\n\nTechnology and Interior Updates\n\nThere are welcome improvements to the Cherokee’s technology offerings. A fourth-generation Uconnect system is standard; it comes with standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The standard touchscreen has been enlarged to 7 inches, and a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen is optional. Behind the center console, two USB charge ports and a 115-volt household outlet offer a variety of charging options for backseat passengers.\n\nJeep has also expanded the Cherokee’s safety and driver-assistance options, which now include active parallel/perpendicular parking assist, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nIn the cargo area, Jeep has pushed the side panels outward so there is now a claimed 27 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat that can hold a golf bag sideways. There is also a reversible rear cargo floor — one side carpeted and the other rubberized — so if you have to carry around dirty or wet items you don’t have to worry about the carpet soaking it up.\n\nValue Still a Weakness\n\nThe 2019 Cherokee has a base price that is $400 less than last year’s model, but that’s partially offset by a $100 increase in the destination charge. So, a front-wheel-drive Latitude will start at $25,190 (all prices include destination charges). That jumps up to $27,690 for Latitude Plus, $31,570 for the Limited, $34,315 for the Trailhawk and $37,270 for the Overland. The Trailhawk includes the robust standard all-wheel drive, but for the rest, AWD costs another $1,500. The V-6 adds $1,745 and the new turbocharged four-cylinder engine adds $500 on top of that.\n\nThe Cherokee Overland I drove came with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, a dual-pane moonroof and the Technology Group with all of the advanced safety features for $42,755.\n\nThe competitors that Jeep had on hand (Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4) don’t come close to that high a price. I tried to build a 2018 Honda CR-V as expensive as my test Cherokee (without adding dealer extras) and I got only as far as $35,553.\n\nThe Cherokee also hits one of my pet peeves — it’s hard to add safety equipment! Forward collision warning with automatic braking isn’t standard on any trim levels. You can’t even get it (or adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist) on Latitude or Latitude Plus, and to get it on the other trims requires the whole Technology Package. These features are standard on all RAV4s and every CR-V trim level except the base one.\n\nI found the Cherokee to be a solid, well-rounded compact SUV with decent interior comfort, and the new engine is a very solid performer. However, unless the Trailhawk’s capability is a must for you, the 2019 Cherokee doesn’t offer a compelling case over its competitors for the extra cost.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
