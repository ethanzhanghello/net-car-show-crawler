      "expert_review": "The Jeep Grand Cherokee is getting a mild update for the 2026 model year — extremely mild, if the first images the brand has released are anything to go by. The tight front three-quarter exterior shot shows slightly updated forms in the headlight, grille and front bumper, but nothing appears to be a dramatic departure from the current SUV.\n\nRelated: What’s New for the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDitto the interior, which shows the Jeep retaining its basic layout of the dash, including the available passenger-side touchscreen. A pair of knobs flanking the center display are a welcome sight, presumably resurrecting physical controls for the audio volume and radio tuning. The climate control knobs below the touchscreen are gone, however, replaced by touch-capacitive buttons. But otherwise, control placements appear to be largely the same, with a row of piano-key buttons above the infotainment touchscreen.\n\n2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee | Manufacturer image\nAn Up-to-Date Foundation\n\nJeep has confirmed that it will continue to offer the Grand Cherokee in the standard-wheelbase, two-row configuration with five seats and the long-wheelbase, three-row Grand Cherokee L. The Grand Cherokee 4xe, one of the bestselling plug-in hybrids in the country, will also remain on the roster.\n\nVehicles undergoing face-lifts like this are typically brought up to date with their manufacturer’s newest technology features, but the Grand Cherokee is already among the most technologically advanced Jeeps. It is one of just a small handful of Stellantis products to offer the conglomerate’s Hands-Free Active Driving Assist, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering, and the latest version of the brand’s infotainment software, Uconnect 5, is standard on the 2025 model.\n\nWhat Is the Release Date for the 2026 Grand Cherokee?\n\nWe’ll find out exactly what sort of enhancements Jeep has worked up for the updated SUV soon. The 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee will make its debut later this year.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review: Grander Across the Board\nHow ‘American’ Are the Bestselling Vehicles Made in the U.S.?\nWhat’s It Like Owning a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk for 2 Years?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe?\nResearch the Jeep Grand Cherokee\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Why are people buying so many sport utility vehicles? It’s a trend that happened way before the current round of winter storms recast the Northeast into Antarctica.\n\nNo, it’s the overall driving experience that makes them so appealing. And one of the most popular is the original, the Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nWith its squarish stance, the Grand Cherokee has a solid, distinctive look that inspires confidence when climbing into it.\n\nIt also has the power to back up the image.\n\nThe standard power train is Jeep’s long-running 4.0-liter in-line six-cylinder. This 242-cubic-inch power plant churns out 185 horsepower at 4,600 rpm and a whopping 220 pound-feet of torque at a low 2,400 rpm. This kind of power renders the optional 220 horsepower 5.2-liter V-8 a luxury, not a necessity.\n\nGrand Cherokees come in two flavors, base Laredo and the dressier, uptown Limited. Drive trains include a base rear-wheel-drive version, full-time shift-on-the-fly Selec-Trac, and full-time Quadra-Trac, a transparent four-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe Limited is more for those seeking status than an honest-to-goodness four-wheel-drive vehicle. The Laredo, with its standard six, provides plenty of power across a wide range of speeds. With a mighty roar, you’ll be propelled across a field, whether it be blacktop or of the green and gooshy variety. Acceleration is instant and gratifying. Refinements make this engine quieter than previous editions. Although not as quiet as a luxury cruiser, the noise levels were satisfyingly low.\n\nThe handling was better than you would expect. With its quick steering and good pulling power, the handling is as sporting as you get in a truck. Corners can be taken with confidence, mostly because of the width of the vehicle. It never felt tippy in turns.\n\nThe test vehicle featured the Up-Country suspension group. If you’re serious about off-roading, the fatter tires, skid plates and one-inch higher ride height will help you plow through the fjords. But without running boards, it will be hard for the missus to climb in for a night on the town.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no snow on the ground for this road test, but the Grand Cherokee handled inclement weather with ease. The shift-on-the-fly Selec-Trac was easy to use, allowing the flexibility of just rear-wheel drive when desired. The four-speed electronic automatic transmission shifted unobtrusively. Braking was short and assured.\n\nOf course, the biggest news for ’96 is the new interior, which is much improved over the original interior. The dash has the squared-off feel of last year, but the ergonomics have been improved. Dual air bags are now standard, and the center console is now color-keyed with integrated cup-holders. Power window, locks and mirror switches are now illuminated at night. An auxiliary 12-volt power outlet and driver’s left foot rest are new features as well.\n\nThe steering whee l is thick and feels good to the touch. The rear seats are split. Keyless entry is standard, the AM/ FM cassette CD provided hours of entertainment, and the optional power leather seats with lumbar support were comfortable over long distances.\n\nOverall, the feel of the new interior is one of spaciousness and convenience. Other sport utilities might feel more luxurious, but they’re no more convenient.\n\nUltimately, what might be the reason is this Jeep has a brawny character and all-weather abilities that is lacking in many of today’s bland blob-mobiles. It can cart the groceries across town or a snow-packed highway. And it can do it with comfort and style. Add to that Jeep’s increasing refinement, and you have a vehicle that continues to improve with each generation.\n\n1996 Grand Cherokee Laredo Standard Equipment: 4.0-liter six-cylinder, Selec-Trac four-wheel drive, dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, dual heated mirrors, ro f rack, aluminum wheels, P215/75R15 tires, split folding rear seats, AM/FM cassette stereo, rear seat heating ducts, speed-sensitive steering, leather-wrapped steering tilt wheel, cruise control, rear defogger and wiper, power windows and door locks, keyless entry.

      "expert_review": "Jeep Grand Cherokee started the revolution toward stylish, upscale sport-utility vehicles in 1992, just as the original Cherokee popularized the whole sport-ute segment a decade earlier.\n\nBut for ’99, the all-new Grand Cherokee is playing catch-up in a world crowded with Navigators, Escalades, Land Cruisers, ML430s and other cushy high-end utes that have taken the place of luxury cars in ritzy driveways.\n\nNo doubt the erstwhile Grand Cherokee needed updating. Despite its rugged good looks and abilities, it was noisy, gobbled gas and suffered from spotty reliability. That, and the interior, needed some attention.\n\nAnd in redesigning the Grand Cherokee, DaimlerChrysler (nee Chrysler Motors) faced the dilemma it did a couple of years back when updating the classic Jeep Wrangler: make it better and make it modern without losing its distinctive Jeep character.\n\nIt took an amazing $2.65 billion to accomplish that feat. But as they did with the Wrangler, the engineers and designers hatched a successful and favorable update of a modern classic, the second generation of the Grand Cherokee.\n\nSo, was the money well spent? I think so, even though the makeover treads no new ground. A lot of it has to do with refinement – a better dashboard, nicer interior, slicker drivetrain – resulting in an all-around upgrade of the Grand Cherokee.\n\nNow I can say some nice things about the Grand Cherokee that never applied before: It’s quick on the highway, handles great, has a roomy cargo area, a comfortable interior, and a dashboard that actually makes sense. The look is more angular and aggressive, but not so very different from the former version. You have to look twice to see the difference.\n\nIts compact size takes out some interior space, but its performance is first-rate, especially with the new, optional V-8, which is smaller in displacement than the former V-8 but nearly identical in performance. And considerably smoother, quieter and cleaner-running. The old 5.9-liter V-8 was a rough, noisy throwback in comparison.\n\nGas mileage is still a problem, though. Just look at the figures.\n\nThe standard engine is still the 4-liter in-line six, but it, too, has been refined, according to press reports, including a 10 percent horsepower upgrade to 190.\n\nDaimlerChrysler says the reliability question has been researched and addressed, and the sins of past Grand Cherokees will not be visited upon its offspring. Time will tell.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is still a champ on the rocky trail. Although few of these Jeeps will ever get off-road, statistically speaking, this is the element in which they shine.\n\nNear Black Canyon City, on a winding torture trail that seems to get worse every time I crawl over it, the Grand Cherokee easily traversed boulders, sharp inclines, steep descents, washed-out areas and loose surfaces, showing off its Jeep roots with easy competence.\n\nAnd while the Jeep was hard at work, the occupants were comfortable and re latively unaware of the action under the wheels (other than the steep tilts). The V-8 showed off its muscle, accelerating up hills with just a touch on the gas pedal, the Jeep feeling like some kind of four-wheeler hot rod.\n\nStandard on the V-8-powered Grand Cherokee, and optional on six-cylinder models, is Jeep’s Quadra-Trac II system. This unique setup transfers torque front to rear and side to side so the Jeep will continue chugging along if at least one wheel has traction.\n\nOn pavement, all four wheels stay engaged, helping to negotiate wet or icy turns, or slog through snow or mud. Off the highway, when the trail gets tough, there’s a low range just like regular four-wheel drive. The system makes four-wheeling a piece of cake.\n\nThe interior is fairly roomy, relative to the compact dimensions, though back-seat passengers may feel cramped. The new dashboardis cleaner and clearer and more befitting an upscale vehicle, losing some of its flat surfaces and square edges in favo r of a more carlike look.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee designers also came to their senses and removed the bulky spare tire from the luggage area. And they didn’t stick it underneath the truck or hang it off the rear door.\n\nThey created a stowage area under the rear-deck floor, keeping the spare out of sight and safe from harm. That required making the Jeep 3 inches longer overall, but those are inches well spent.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is not cheap, but you get a lot of ute for your money. If it’s too much, try the original Cherokee, which continues to soldier on at a budget price. A good deal for a still-stylin’ vehicle.\n\nThe new Grand Cherokee is better looking, better performing and more comfortable, yet it continues to be what it set out to be.\n\nThe best sport ute for the money? Maybe. At least it’s the real thing.\n\n1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sport-utility vehicle, four-wheel drive. Base price: $33,890. Price as tested: $35,755.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRedesigned for the 1999 model year, Jeep’s flagship model only receives minor changes this year. The 1999 Grand Cherokee received several awards, including North American Truck of the Year, an annual award from a panel of more than 45 automotive journalists.\n\nAs one would guess from its moniker, the Grand Cherokee is larger, more luxurious and more expensive than the Jeep Cherokee. Though both are considered compact sport utility vehicles, Grand Cherokee is positioned at the higher end of the market and comes close to a mid-size SUV.\n\nInterior\nFront seat-belt pretensioners, which cinch the belts in a collision, are a new standard feature. Both the Laredo and Limited models seat five, but the ritzier Limited comes with standard leather upholstery (optional on the Laredo). Unlike the Cherokee, with its spare tire in the cargo bay, the Grand Cherokee’s spare is under the cargo floor, increasing cargo area.\n\nExterior\nYou know it’s a Jeep by the bold, upright grille, a trademark of the brand. Grand Cherokee comes in four-door styling and is 14 inches longer than the Cherokee. Unlike many of its competitors, which have gravitated toward a more rounded, sometimes bulbous look, the Grand Cherokee has for the most part retained the harder-edged look that makes it instantly recognizable.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 195-horsepower, 4.0-liter, inline six-cylinder is the base engine, and a 230-horsepower, 4.7-liter V-8 is optional. This year, the V-8 is available with 2WD as well as 4WD.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nJeeps top-shelf model adds a five-speed automatic transmission for its V-8 engine but sees no major changes this year. Grand Cherokee, which is larger and more expensive than the Cherokee, was redesigned for the 1999 model year.\n\nAs Jeeps highest-volume SUV, it competes with the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Blazer, Toyota 4Runner and other midsize rivals, as well as luxury models such as the Infiniti QX4 and Lexus RX 300.\n\nExterior\nGrand Cherokee comes in classic four-door SUV styling highlighted by a bold, upright grille that is a Jeep trademark. At 181 inches bumper to bumper, it is 14 inches longer than the Cherokee and 9 inches shorter than the Ford Explorer. The rear liftgate has a window that swings up separately.\n\nInterior\nBoth the Laredo and Limited models seat five, but the ritzier Limited comes with standard leather upholstery (an option on the Laredo). Unlike the Cherokee, whose spare tire is in the cargo bay, the Grand Cherokees spare is underneath the rear cargo floor. Cargo volume is 72 cubic feet with the rear seat folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 195-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 is the base engine and comes with a four-speed automatic transmission. This year, a 230-hp 4.7-liter V-8 is optional and comes with a five-speed automatic transmission instead of the four-speed.\n\nBoth engines are available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and there is a choice of 4WD systems. Selec-Trac is a full-time system that can be left in 4WD on dry pavement or turned off. Quadra-Trac is a permanently engaged system that distributes power among the wheels as needed for traction.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe V-8 is a smooth, potent engine that generates neck-snapping passing power. Its only drawbacks are high fuel consumption and excessive engine fan noise when it is first started.\n\nDespite being smaller on the outside than some key rivals, the Grand Cherokee doesnt seem short of passenger or cargo room, and the Limited model treats occupants to first-class accommodations. Neither the Laredo nor the Limited is cheap, so it may be worthwhile to shop other brands before making a decision.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "To paraphrase one of Lee Iacocca’s televised pep talks: In the sport-utility business, you either lead, follow or get out of the way.\n\nThe new and very adroit Jeep Grand Cherokee seems capable of completing all three moves.\n\nLead. It carries a definite promise of leadership, with sales of the base Cherokee and up-market Grand Cherokee creeping up on first-place Ford Explorer in the sport-utility stakes. In a rare, total rout of the Asian competition, these two product lines account for about 60% of the domestic market for sod bruisers.\n\nFollow. Jeep-Chrysler clearly has pursued customer demands for a quality-built four-wheel-drive vehicle with elegant appointments and neat mechanical luxuries without uncouth pricing.\n\nAnd the Grand Cherokee certainly has enough performance to get out of the way–then quietly motor ahead of–Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, Pathfinder, Range Rover, Oldsmobile Bravada and other five-door, 4WD vehicles that weigh much more and consequently get up and go just that much slower.\n\nTo maintain all this fresh superiority, the three varieties of Grand Cherokee–base model, mid-range Laredo and top-of-the-line Limited–have several other things going for them. They are the only sport-utility vehicles with a driver’s-side air bag. It is standard equipment. So are four-wheel, anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee’s in-line, six-cylinder engine develops 190 horsepower for another first in class–also more oomph and torque than the prestigious and horribly expensive Range Rover gets from its V-8.\n\nThere are three separate transfer cases to choose from. Options range from part-time 4WD–with shift on the fly–to a full-time 4WD where the only manual responsibility is shifting into low range when off-road conditions are boulders in pudding.\n\nOf critical importance and another triumph: The center console cup holders yawn wide enough for two Big Gulps or a couple of Gatorade bottles.\n\nThe price isn’t bad either: $19,000 for the base Grand Cherokee with a five-speed manual, to $28,000 for a fully loaded Limited with leather seats, automatic headlights, anti-theft system and other urban luxuries.\n\nBut the ultimate proof of this particular pudding-crosser is its switches. Seriously.\n\nAnyone who has spent time shuttling between domestic and imported vehicles knows that a Detroit product can be identified blindfolded. Its wiper, turn, headlight and climate switches usually rattle, clack, flop and feel quite remote from whatever their functions happen to be.\n\nOn the Grand Cherokee, all switches, whether on stalks or dashboard, have a whispering solidness attached to what they do. Tolerances are close. Everything fits palm or fingertips with no coarse edges–the unmistakable feel of some committee’s thoughtful attention to tactile quality.\n\nErgonomically, the vehicle is superb. Door latches are precisely where they sho uld be at that first, instinctive grope. Opening the tailgate wouldn’t be a wincing heave for a sleepy 10-year-old. Nothing in the Grand Cherokee requires a body to have triple joints or rubber bones to operate from any station.\n\nAnd the keys fit easily and logically. Hallelujah. Another giant step for Detroit.\n\nThe first new Jeep unveiled since Chrysler purchased the nameplate in 1987–although by then, this particular design had been completed by American Motors–the Grand Cherokee is longer, wider and higher with more hip, shoulder, leg and headroom than the Wonderbread Cherokee.\n\nExternally, the styling, if not up to the moment, is certainly up to the model year and the looks of the competition.\n\nBut fog lamps mounted atop the front bumper are an afterthought that should never have been allowed.\n\nEdges have been softened and the truck look diminished. Fat slots for a grille tell all observers this definitely is a Jeep. Lace-alloy wheels, col r highlighted to match body striping, say this vehicle is expensively dressed for dinner anywhere.\n\nIn fact, in this era of the $45,000 sedan–with apparent retaliation being a 16% jump in sport-utility sales during the first quarter of 1992–arriving at Chardonnay in a Grand Cherokee will be considered a tribute to one’s sense of high fashion and fiscal sanity.\n\nFrom a split-bench rear seat that folds flat to open up 79.2 cubic feet of cargo space to mounting those seats ahead of the wheel wells for greater hip room, the interior of the Grand Cherokee is a dream.\n\nVision is that of a large goldfish bowl. Front seats are huge buckets with sufficient support from padding and shoulder-lap safety belts to prevent floating bodies when the terrain turns lumpy. And the steering wheel, by appearance, tilt setting and heft once under way, has lost that blue-collar feel of sitting at the wheel of a dump truck.\n\nBut the wood accents are faux and tend to push out and separate from the dash. Those paying close to $30K for the best possible Jeep deserve a little better.\n\nThe spare wheel is stored inside the Grand Cherokee, which removes cargo space. Nor does Jeep offer a rear-door rack for the spare. That might irritate owners more interested in the utility, rather than in the sporting potential, of the vehicle.\n\nA traditional challenge for makers of Jeeps, Blazers, Troopers et al., has been to combine in one vehicle the mechanical skills for bridging extremes of getting from here to there. That is to say, being able to build a vehicle capable of carrying soft people over smooth suburban asphalt while remaining ready to jounce across hectares of rural gludge without leaving a litter of bolts and broken shock absorbers.\n\nThe result has been a generation of suburban cowboys; heavily padded and lightly disguised trucks said to have “the feel of a car.” Truth is, no short-wheelbase, high profile vehicle with a quivering center of gravity and mechanicals geared for heaving and bouncing in the dirt can have the precise feel of a car. They usually weigh too much. Off-road and on-road suspension requirements are incompatible.\n\nTo fully provide that car feel would mean sacrificing the rugged, thick-wristed look and heft of the vehicle. And if that image wasn’t of paramount importance among the sport-utility set, they’d all be out buying Saturns.\n\nIn its search for the middle ground, however, the Grand Cherokee probably is the best there has been in replicating the motion and propulsion of a passenger car.\n\nIt will accelerate alongside such proven people carriers as Honda Accord, Volvo 960, Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Caprice. With a top speed of 110 m.p.h., Grand Cherokee rolls faster than Buick Regal, Ford Crown Victoria and Pontiac Grand Am.\n\nIt has been built lighter with a stiffer chassis. That allows a firmer, more precise suspension setup. The track–the distance be tween the Grand Cherokee’s wheels–has been widened for a touch more flatness and stability.\n\nSo body roll when cornering is down to a minimum–unless that cornering is borderline brutal. Driving straight and level produces little float–until speeds start approaching big-time illegal.\n\nBut do beware of this relatively high performance. It may suck a driver into situations in which quick recoveries can become a handful. A heavier steering feel would be a huge assist. Sadly, the vehicle’s directional control has been lightened a little too close to the unfeeling and vapid.\n\nOff-road–although it is estimated that far less than 10% of sport-utility owners ever tackle terrain worse than a dirt parking lot–the Grand Cherokee will climb just about everything except Eagle Rock.\n\nThanks to a unique system of damping suspension movements–where the vertical travel of the engine absorbs opposing movements of the wheels–the vehicle soaks up hefty potholesan ruts without bringing motion queasies to anyone in the passenger compartment.\n\nStill, some things can never change.\n\nSport-utilities remain thirsty for gas.\n\nThey are not quiet vehicles.\n\nNor would they be a popular choice for some really extended touring.\n\nAnd with gullies to straddle and boulders to hurdle, all sport-utility vehicles ride high off the ground and tall in the saddle.\n\nSo for every passenger who steps down from a Grand Cherokee, expect three to fall out.\n\n1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited\n\nThe Good Feels more like a car than other sport utilities.

      "expert_review": "Sure sounded like a good idea at the time, a V-8-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee that would wait for no other machine.\n\nNeed to tow a boat? The V-8 Grand Cherokee can pull the Queen Mary strapped to the back of the Titanic.\n\nNeed to climb a hill? Take the V-8 Grand Cherokee up Mt. Everest, where the full-time four-wheel-drive and anti-lock brakes come in handy too.\n\nNeed to move quickly from the light? Tap the pedal and you leave all other SUVs, and most sedans and coupes, in your fumes as the V-8 roars down the pavement as if awaiting a checkered flag at the other end.\n\nUnfortunately, the 5.9-liter, 245-horsepower V-8 in the Jeep Grand Cherokee for 1998 requires you stop as quickly as you start–each time you spot a filling station. The 13-m.p.g. city/17-m.p.g. highway rating is abysmal.\n\nAt a time when some folks are questioning how fashionable it is to be seen in an SUV, with the V-8 Grand Cherokee, you’ll be seen a lot–alongside it, with a lead-free gas nozzle in your hand. Dress nicely.\n\nOf course, those who buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with the 5.9-liter V-8 are going to have the funds to be fashionable. The homeless certainly can’t afford $38,175, before options and freight.\n\nChrysler boasts that the Grand Cherokee with its new 5.9-liter V-8 is the “fastest, most powerful Jeep vehicle ever built, with a 0- to 60-m.p.h. time of 7.3 seconds.”\n\nWow! But so what?\n\nWho pays $41,000 for a 4WD off-road-capable machine to take it to the drag strip? At 13 m.p.g. city/17 highway if you baby the machine, what does it obtain when you’re checking out the 7.3-second claim?\n\nOK, gas prices are relatively cheap, so who cares about the cost of fuel when the 5.9-liter V-8 can blow the wheels off just about every other vehicle on the road except those with Italian names and those that travel banked tracks on Sundays?\n\nThe 5.9-liter V-8 was added for ’98 because the 5.2-liter V-8 was judged a bit under powered. Yet the 5.2 develops 220 h.p. and 300 foot-pounds of torque at 2,800 r.p.m. How much more power do you need? The answer seems to be the 245 h.p. and 345 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 r.p.m. the 5.9 develops.\n\nOf course, the pros and cons of the 5.9-liter V-8 become moot in a few months when Chrysler brings out its redesigned 1999 Grand Cherokee with a new 4.7-liter V-8 to replace the 5.2-liter V-8. The 5.9-liter also will be dropped from the Jeep then.\n\nWhy a 4.7-liter V-8? Because Chrysler figured it needed far better mileage from its big Jeep Grand Cherokee than 13 m.p.g. in the city and 17 m.p.g. on the open highway.\n\nWhile 13/17 might not bother those wanting the fastest SUV on the road, those aren’t numbers that make the Environmental Protection Agency, keeper of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, ratings, cheer.\n\nWith the arrival of the 4.7, Chrysler als o will revise the big SUV’s suspension to one similar to that at Cadillac, which reads road surfaces and calculates engine speeds to provide more control and stability on flat, rolling, curved or winding surfaces.\n\nThe suspension on the ’98 Grand Cherokee we tested isn’t bad. If anything, based on the 5.9-liter V-8 under the hood, you would expect it to be a bit firm, and somewhat harsh, for more aggressive driving. It turned out to be on the soft, cushy side so you barely feel road abrasions.\n\nYou can expect that the more sophisticated computer-controlled electronic suspension for ’99 will improve ride and handling, and by becoming more in tune with the pavement, make you feel as if the 4.7 is developing more horsepower than it does.\n\nAn optional air suspension also will let the driver raise the chassis for off-roading or lower it for better mileage on the interstate.\n\nSUV heights are coming into question, especially when it comes to the fr nt bumper, which, on most SUVs, doesn’t line up with the bumper on many sedans and coupes. So, i n an impact, the SUV overrides the other car.\n\nOutside this office, a subcompact Plymouth Neon parked nose-to-nose with the Grand Cherokee, made it clear that in a collision, the Grand Cherokee’s bumper would meet the Neon’s headlamps.\n\nThe concern, of course, is for those in the Neon. The automakers have two options–lowering the SUVs or raising sedans and coupes. Anyone who has enjoyed the ability to see down the road in an SUV might vote for taller cars.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nLooking to this fall, Chrysler also will focus more on Grand Cherokee ride and handling by stretching the wheelbase of the current 105.9-inch version. Should help, as would widening the track to add to road stability.\n\nThough the Grand Cherokee could use a mileage boost, the vehicle we tested had several noteworthy features, such as huge outside mirrors for excellent side and rear visibility; a spot inside against the side wall in back for the spare tire, where it took up very little cargo room; a plastic shade that slides out from the back seat and around the spare to hide items in the cargo hold; large plastic lower bodyside cladding to keep the body panels from bearing the brunt of misguided doors or grocery carts; and split folding rear seats that allow one or both to be lowered to enable you to toss in skis or 2-by-4s.\n\nThe vehicle also comes with full-time 4WD, one reason the mileage rating is so low. A transfer lever lets you shift into four-wheel low when needed for off-roading, heavy snow or deep sand.\n\nThough the chassis is raised for off-road usage, you can enter or exit the Grand Cherokee without having to take a running leap.\n\nOther nice touches include two power plugs for accessories such as a phone; solid dual cupholders built into the center console; an armrest between the two frontseats that serves as a top for a stowage bin; pull-out storage bins in the doors; a rear hatch with a window that opens on its own (with a button so you don’t have to fiddle with a key) or as part of the hatch; and well-designed dash and instrument panel controls that are easy to see and use.\n\nThe only controls not within easy sight or reach are those for the heated leather seats that are behind the steering wheel. And it sure seemed a long time before the heat kicked in.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited comes loaded, as it should for that $38,175 base price. There are dual depowered air bags; rear window washer/wiper/defroster; a much-needed 23-gallon fuel tank; air conditioning; power windows and door locks; tilt steering; cruise control; garage door opener; AM-FM stereo with compact-disc player/cassette/10 speakers; leather-wrapped steering wheel; front and rear floor mats; power sunroof; automatic on/off headlamps; roof rack; power foldaway mirrors; an d 16-inch radial tires.\n\nOur test vehicle came with a preferred-equipment package that added little in comfort or convenience for $2,645 other than sun-screen tinted glass, all-season radials and heated mirrors.\n\n>> 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Wheelbase: 105.9 inches Length: 177.2 inches Engine: 5.9-liter, 245-h.p.

      "expert_review": "A Jeep with a Hemi?\n\nNow that’s a novel idea, particularly a 330-horsepower Hemi V-8 with cylinder displacement, which allows it to shut itself down to just four cylinders to save gasoline during highway cruising.\n\nThe latest rendention of Chrysler’s legendary Hemi-type engines is offered as the top upgrade for the redesigned Grand Cherokee, which made its debut this past fall as a 2005 model.\n\nThe newest Grand Cherokee, available with not only the 5.7-liter Hemi but also a base V-6 or a midlevel 4.7-liter V-8, represents the third generation of the modern, unibody SUV that Chrysler introduced in 1992.\n\nThe most radical change is the addition of the Hemi to the lineup. (Even more power is coming this fall with the introduction of the 2006 Grand Cherokee SRT-8 model — with a 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 cranking out 415 horsepower.)\n\nFor 2005, the Grand Cherokee’s styling has updated, but the changes are subtle so the vehicle still looks like a Grand Cherokee. Still missing, though, is a third row of seating, which has become almost a requirement for SUVs in this class.\n\nInstead, Jeep will introduce an all-new SUV later this year that is a bit larger than the Grand Cherokee, and which has a third seat. Based on the current Grand Cherokee, but with boxier exterior styling, that vehicle will be called the Commander.\n\nThe new Grand Cherokee’s Hemi V-8 engine is similar to the ones used in other DaimlerChrysler vehicles, rated at 330 horsepower and 375 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nIn our test vehicle, the 2005 Grand Cherolee Limited model with four-wheel drive (base price $34,045 plus $645 freight), the Hemi engine was a $1,245 upgrade, which also included electronic limited-slip front and rear axles, and an upgrade to Jeep’s Quadra-Drive II four-wheel-drive system from the midlevel Quadra-Trac II system that is included in the base Limited price.\n\nThe limited-slip differentials are part of a package designed to help make this Grand Cherokee as off-road capable as it can be — the hallmark of a real Jeep.\n\nFor serious off-roading, the Quadra-Drive II system is best. It includes a full-time transfer case with electronic limited-slip differentials in the front, center and rear. The midlevel system, Quadra-Trac II, has an electronic-locking center differential in the two-speed transfer case (the same one used in the Quadra-Drive system), but no locks for the front and rear axles.\n\nFor those who live in snow country and just need basic four-wheel drive there is the Quara-Trac I system, which is full-time four-wheel drive but with no two-speed transfer case. This one can’t be put into low range for serious off-roading.\n\nThose who don’t care about four-wheel drive — such as most consumers in Texas — can opt for two-wheel-drive versions of the Grand Cherokee, which are less-expensive but not as versatile.\n\nChrysler says the Quadra-Drive II system on our Hemi test vehicle combines the NV245 full-time transfer case from the Quadra-Trac II system with those electronic limited-slip differentials “for best-in-class tractive performance.”\n\nThe system is designed to detect when a drive wheel begins slipping, and then to re-distribute engine torque to whichever wheels still have traction. In some cases, Chrysler says, the system will even anticipate low traction and adjust itself accordingly.\n\nWith the Quadra-Drive II system, there is a lever on the shift console that puts the vehicle into low range. And here is a plus for those with motorhomes: The transfer case can be shifted into “neutral” so the Grand Cherokee can be towed behind the motorhome with all four wheels on the ground.\n\nChrysler says the Quadra-Drive II system uses electronically controlled clutch packs to lock each axle automatically, as needed.\n\nThese electronic lockers aren’t quite as good as the simple locking front, center and rear differentials found in many modified Jeep CJs and other serious off-road vehicles, but for a car equipped at the factory, it’s a very good arrangement.\n\nTo address one of the biggest complaints with the prior Grand Cherokee models — that they were too cramped inside — the new generation is bigger and roomier, although not drastically so.\n\nThe new model is 3.3 inches longer than before, and an inch wider. But there is some loss of headroom, as the new one is 1.7 inches shorter. It has what Chrysler calls a “reduced glass-to-body” ratio, which means there is less glass area. That comes primarily from lowering the roof.\n\nThis has more to do with stability that esthetics, however. Lowering the roof brings the car closer to the ground and reduces its propensity to roll in a sharp turn.\n\nThe new Grand Cherokee’s base engine is the same 3.7-liter V-6 used in the compact Jeep Liberty SUV, which has 210 horsepower — up 15 from the 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder that served as base engine in the previous Grand Cherokee, including the one in my garage.\n\nThat inline six-cylinder had been a mainstay of the Grand Cherokee from the beginning, carried over from the Cherokee. The Liberty’s V-6 has proven itself to be more reliable.\n\nCarried over from the previous model was the midlevel 4.7-liter V-8 engine, rated at 235 horsepower. Most Grand Cherokee owners probably will choose this engine, as it will offer the best value for the money.\n\nTo help with fuel economy, the Hemi comes with a system the Multi-Displacement System, which deactivates half of the cylinders during cruising and light acceleration to increase fuel economy by up to 20 percent, depending on driving conditions, Chrysler says.\n\nFuel-economy ratings for our Hemi model were 14 miles per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the highway, compared with 15 city/20 highway for the smaller 4.7-liter V-8. Surprisingly, the V-6 doesn’t do much better; the ratings are 16 city/21 highway.\n\nAn all-new five-speed automatic transmission comes with the 3.7-liter V-6, while the five-speed automatic from the previous model carried over to the new models with V-8 engines. Chrysler had to use different transmissions because the one for the V-6 wasn’t able to handle the torque of the two V-8s.\n\nThese transmissions feature electronic range-select shift control, Chrysler says, which shifts automatically in the “drive” position, but allows the driver to shift manually by moving the shifter left and right from the “drive” position (no clutch, though). Although our test model started at nearly $35,000 and, with options, carried a sticker price of $41,385 (including freight), V-6 base Laredo models begin as low as $26,775 (including freight). That is $1,780 less than the starting price of the 2004 model.\n\nThe Laredo models come with the V-6 engine, while the Limited models get the 4.7-liter V-8. The Hemi can be added only to the Limited model, and only with four-wheel drive. The big engine isn’t offered in two-wheel-drive models.\n\nStandard features on the Laredo include 17-inch satin-silver wheels, power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, cruise control, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, four-way power driver seat with driver and passenger lumbar adjustment, and a tire-pressure monitoring system.\n\nWith the Limited model, extras include power adjustable pedals with memory; rain-sensing automatic windshield wipers; leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel;\n\nelectrochromatic rearview mirror; six-way power driver and four-way power front passenger seat; dual-zone automatic climate control; AM/FM/compact-disc audio system with six-disc in-dash changer and MP3 playback, along with a Boston Acousics premium six-speaker system and 276-watt digital amplifier; and leather interior.\n\nOptions on our test vehicle, besides the Hemi engine and locking axles, included a “preferred package” ($1,925), which added electronic stability control, power sunroof, hands-free communications, and SmartBeam headlights; an electronic information group ($1,200), which tacked on an overhead rear console and rear entertailment system; a four-by-four equipment package ($595), which brought underbody skid plates, tow hooks and off-road tires; a navigation system with six-disc MP3-capable CD changer ($1,245); Sirius satellite radio ($195); rear back-up alarm system ($255); and a tire-pressure monitoring system display ($85).\n\n– – –\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Posted on 12/9/02\nVehicle Overview\nThe Grand Cherokee was last redesigned for the 1999 model year. This top-of-the-line model from DaimlerChryslers Jeep division has been its highest-volume seller by far. As reported by Automotive News, sales dipped by 17.7 percent during 2001, but the 223,612 units sold still helps in keeping the Jeep brand strong in market share.\n\nThe four-door Grand Cherokee is larger than its Liberty sibling. It competes against the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner and other midsize models, as well as luxury sport utility vehicles like the Infiniti QX4 and Lexus RX 300.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee comes in Laredo and Limited trim levels. A four-wheel-drive (4WD) Premium Overland model with a new high-output 4.7-liter V-8 engine and standard curtain-type airbags debuted in the 2002 model year. The high-output engine delivers 260 horsepower rather than the usual 235 hp. Overland editions also feature unique front and rear styling and a redwood-accented interior. Curtain-type airbags and a tire-pressure monitor became optional in 2002. Details on changes for the 2003 model year have not yet been released.\n\nExterior\nFeaturing the bold upright grille that Jeep is known for, the Grand Cherokees classic four-door SUV styling is evident even if it is more rounded than some rivals. The SUV measures 181.6 inches long overall, rides a 105.9-inch wheelbase, stands 70.3 inches tall and stretches 72.6 inches wide. The rear liftgate features a window that swings up separately. A roof rack is standard.\n\nInterior\nAll Grand Cherokee models seat five occupants. Leather upholstery is standard in the snazzier Limited Edition and optional in the Laredo. Cargo volume is 72 cubic feet with the rear seat folded. The Grand Cherokees spare tire is mounted underneath the rear cargo floor. Standard Laredo equipment includes a CD player, rear privacy glass, and power windows, door locks and mirrors. Stepping up to the Limited model adds such features as automatic dual-zone temperature control, power front seats, heated mirrors and an Infinity audio system. The Overland models have a 10-CD changer, rain-sensing wipers, heated front seats, and a wood- and leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard engine in the Grand Cherokee is a 195-hp, 4.0-liter inline-six-cylinder that drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. The optional 235-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 engine teams with a five-speed automatic. For peak performance, the Overland gets a high-output 260-hp version of the V-8, which is also optional in the Limited.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee comes with either rear-wheel drive or one of two 4WD systems, which depends on the model. Selec-Trac is a full-time 4WD system that can be left in 4WD mode on dry pavement; it is standard on the Laredo. Quadra-Trac offers on-demand 4WD that distributes power among the four wheels as needed for traction; it is available on the Limited and Overland models. Both systems have a two-speed transfer case.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Curtain-type airbags are standard in the Overland and optional in the other models.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "So why is everyone getting so excited about the coming “luxury” sport-utility vehicles when Chrysler has a vehicle decked out with every creature comfort and amenity known to man at $32,631.\n\nHmmm. $32,631. When did sport-utility vehicle’s window stickers equal-and surpass-many people’s annual incomes? OK, the price is steep, but here’s a utility that rides and handles like a Cadillac Seville.\n\nThe optional ($616) 5.2-liter, 220-h.p., V-8 (a 4-liter, 190-h.p., in-line 6 is standard) is smooth and quiet, though like the Trooper LS the price you pay is in never being able to venture far from a gas pump. The rating is 14 m.p.g. city/18 m.p.g. highway.\n\nWhen the snow gets deep, the Grand Cherokee gets going. Our test vehicle came with Quadra-Trac all-time four-wheel-drive that automatically adjusts to changing road conditions to ensure traction. Four-wheel ABS is an added benefit.\n\nLeather seats are nice and cushy, but the first time you slip onto them in mid-August after three days of 100 degree weather, you might wish you got the cooler cloth.\n\nAmple room to carry people and cargo-in style. Power steering almost as silky as that on any Honda, the industry benchmark for quick yet accurate response to wheel input from the driver.\n\nNotable standard equipment includes dual air bags, remote heated mirrors, rear window washer/wiper/defroster, fog lamps, roof rack (a needless creator of screw holes in the roof), AM/FM stereo with cassette, tinted glass, tilt steering, cruise control, air conditioning, power seats/windows/locks, keylessentry, rear seat heat ducts and trip odometer. Add $170 for a compact disc player and $495 for freight. An integrated child seat that pops out of the rear seat when needed or stays hidden when not, is an option.",

      "expert_review": "Cruising down the highway best reveals what is so good about Jeep’s Grand Cherokee. It may be as rugged as a truck, but it has the soul of a car.\n\nWith dirty mountain bikes stowed in back, a friend and I were engaged in animated conversation as I drove, and I found myself constantly exceeding the speed limit unless I used the cruise control because this big Jeep rides with the smoothness of a family sedan.\n\nEven though it is capable of four-wheeling, as I experienced on an indoor off-road course at the Michigan State Fairgrounds during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the Grand Cherokee is an outstanding blend of car comfort and sport-utility toughness. It is built with a carlike unibody structure instead of a separate body-on-frame construction derived from a truck.\n\nComfort and versatility are why sport-utility vehicles (SUV) continue to sprout like Topsy, although some doomsayers are predicting that sales are topping out and heading for a plateau. Most manufacturers, however, are predicting strong sales.\n\nThe dual-purpose nature of SUVs such as the Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer gives rise to their appeal. They aren’t quite as “suburban” as minivans, yet they are almost as versatile when it comes to accommodating the paraphernalia of active lifestyles and young families. Their passenger space is generally not much greater than a mid-size sedan, but easy access to a large and usually square cargo hold gives adequate space for hauling large objects. I hauled two bikes simply by removing their front wheels.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the luxurious Orvis package, which included the Up-Country suspension, more ground clearance, different springs, gas shock absorbers, tow hooks, 3.73 rear axle ratio, transmission oil cooler and a full-size spare tire. The only drawback to the indoor-mounted full-size spare tire is that it takes up a meaningful chunk of cargo space.\n\nThe metallic green paint with gold metallic undertone was beautiful, but the light tan and dark green two-tone interior seemed a bit too bright for my taste. Otherwise, the interior was a most pleasant place to be. The seats are comfy, steering easy and a whole host of convenience equipment made our Orvis edition as lavish as a luxury sedan. It had heated seats, automatic climate control, compact disc player, trip computer, sunroof and steering-wheel-mounted controls for cruise control and radio.\n\nThe radio controls mounted on the backside of the steering wheel spokes were among the most usable I have encountered.\n\nPower for our test car came from its optional 5.2-liter V-8. This engine has 220 horsepower, lots of torque and beefy throttle response, making it ideal for towing trailers or boats. The downside to the V-8 is its thirst. The EPA fuel economy rating is 14 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on the highway.\n\nComplementing the off-road suspension of our test vehicle was the full-time, four-wheel-drive Quad ra-Trac system that sends most of the power to the rear wheels until it detects some wheel slippage, at which time it seamlessly transfers power to the front to restore traction. This system works in the background, and its only giveaway is a slight tightening of the steering in parking maneuvers. A separate low range exists for rugged off-road conditions.\n\nWhile the SUV segment continues to expand, the Grand Cherokee is one of the key players responsible for the segment’s popularity. If civility and comfort are important to you, this Jeep has them in abundance.\n\nPrice\n\nConsistent with equipment on par with a luxury sedan, our Grand Cherokee had a base price of $33,790. Options included the Orvis package, trailer towing package, V-8 engine, limited-slip differential and power sunroof.\n\nThe sticker price was $37,567.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are provided by auto manuf turers.\n\nPoint: The Grand Cherokee brings a quiet ride, smooth highway manners and plush interior to the SUV segment.\n\nCounterpoint: The full-size spare tire intrudes on cargo space, and the V-8 is thirsty.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.2-liter, V-8\n\nTRANSMISSION: Automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 105.9 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,926 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $33,790\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $37,567\n\nMPG RATING: 14 city, 17 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "We recently had the chance to drive the most high-tech Jeep yet. It was a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland model with four-wheel drive and some neat features like the brand’s first navigation system and a new hands-free optional wireless phone system called UConnect.\n\nAnita was impressed with the Detroit-built Jeep’s goodies and classic good looks, especially the striking midnight blue pearl coat exterior paint job. Paul begged to differ, especially after seeing the hefty $41,120 price tag on this top-of-the-line offering.\n\nSHE: I’ll bet you had a shock when you saw our home phone number flash on the audio system’s screen in the Jeep. In-vehicle caller ID is a part of that fancy UConnect system, which can be dealer or factory-installed for under $300. I think it’s terrific because you can keep your cell phone in your purse or your briefcase and it doesn’t matter. One push of a button makes your call, while you keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel. Very sensible and easy to use. But it took you a long time to fumble around and press the button on the instrument panel to talk to me, though. What was going on?\n\nHE: I almost drove off the road. Can you say, “Electronic tether for husbands?” I mistakenly thought I’d have some peace and quiet in the Jeep. Wrong. Seeing your phone number come up on the screen made me want to use the Jeep’s new navigation system to plot out a long fishing trip — out of cell-phone reach.\n\nSHE: I don’t think you’d enjoy using the factory-installed $1,200 navigation system. It combines a 4.9-inch color display with an AM/FM stereo and CD player. The screen is pretty small and the controls aren’t easy to use. But you still have to give Jeep credit for stepping into the 21st century at last. You now can order things like $185 power adjustable pedals with memory, a wonderful convenience feature that I love. The top-of-the-line Overland model is a solid offering. They’ve freshened up the face a bit, while keeping much of the classic Grand Cherokee styling. Plus, you get a comfortable ride — among the best in class for truck-based vehicles — and decent safety features, including standard side air bags and anti-lock brakes. Another $150 will buy you a tire-pressure monitoring system to help keep you out of trouble. So why are you being so stingy with your stars?\n\nHE: It could have something to do with the fact that our Jeep’s instrument panel was not properly installed. There was a gap wide enough to shove your fingers into between the edge of the instrument panel and the front pillar. That’s unacceptable quality in a $41,000 vehicle — something you’re not likely to experience on similarly priced competitors like the BMW X5 or the Mercedes-Benz ML350. But there were other issues, too. The Grand Cherokee’s brakes required higher-than-average pedal pressure — not a confidence-inspiring feeling in emergency stops. The power steering is over-assisted and too isol ated, requiring constant corrections at highway speed. The handling is sloppy. Sure, I liked things like the classy white-face gauges and the supportive driver’s seat. But those things weren’t enough to compensate for what I feel are major concerns.\n\nSHE: I had a few gripes after my drive. The Grand Cherokee has a limited rear cargo area and a surprising lack of room in the rear seat. But there’s no criticism in the power department. Our Jeep came equipped with a high-output 4.7-liter V-8 mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. This engine is standard on the Overland and cranks out an impressive 260 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque. Jeep says the five-speed provides a second overdrive gear for increased fuel efficiency, yet our test vehicle only got 15 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. Off-roaders will appreciate the Overland’s capabilities. This model comes equipped with a Quadra-Drive system as a standard feature. This sophisticated system is able to send nearly 100 percent of the developed engine torque to just one wheel, which basically means even a single wheel can pull you out of trouble.\n\nHE: Jeep lovers will applaud the Overland’s attention to cabin details, like a standard sunroof and his-and-hers climate controls. You also get a wood-and-leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry and Infinity speakers. There are heated 10-way power seats and power accessories. But even though this is the most high-tech Jeep we’ve been in, it won’t be a success in my book until they get the basics right. And for that, we may have to wait another year, until an all-new Grand Cherokee arrives for model year 2005.\n\n2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger sport utility vehicle\n\nPrice (Includes $645 destination charge): $38,595; as tested, $41,120\n\nEngine: 4.7-liter V-8; 260-hp; 330 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city / 20 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: BMW X5, Chevrolet TrailBlazer, Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer, GMC Envoy, Honda Pilot, Infiniti QX4, Isuzu Axiom, Kia Sorento, Land Rover Freelander, Lexus RX 330, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz M-Class, Mercury Mountaineer, Mitsubishi Endeavor, Mitsubishi Montero, Nissan Pathfinder, Oldsmobile Bravada, Toyota 4Runner, Volvo XC90\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan.

Lacks sufficient room, especially in rear seat. Navigation system screen too small, controls not easy to use. Fuel economy only average.\n\nPaul’s rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes: Gobs of torque from high-output 4.7-liter V-8. Supportive driver’s seat. Classy white-face gauges.\n\nDislikes: Way too expensive at $41,000. Instrument panel not properly installed, with unsightly gaps. Brakes require higher-than-average pedal pressure.

      "expert_review": "I thought a hot rod Jeep Grand Cherokee would be a bit like the Dodge Ram SRT10 – power overkill just for the heck of it. Driving the Grand Cherokee SRT8 for 800 miles in three days, however, really opened my eyes.\n\nWhat I discovered is that the Grand Cherokee SRT8 is not a four-wheeled caricature, but a delightfully impressive road car of the first magnitude. Of course I expected the 420-horsepower Hemi V-8 to be a giggle, but I was totally surprised by its ability to unload its power in such a sophisticated way. Acceleration was awesome. Jeep says the SRT8 hits 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds, and that makes the SRT8 quicker than a Porsche Cayenne Turbo or a BMW X5. It is priced lower than either.\n\nSo the power was a given, but the road holding, and ride quality, was not at all what I expected. Zinging down the interstate or roaming back-country two lanes, the SRT8 felt as solid as if it were carved from a billet of aluminum. The suspension was firm without the kind of harshness one expects from 20-inch wheels and a low-to-the-ground stance. The SRT8 felt more like a car from its sister company Mercedes-Benz than a Jeep.\n\nHuge Brembo brakes, a deep front spoiler and bucket seats complete the transformation from standard Grand Cherokee to SRT8.\n\nBest of all, the SRT8 has a base price of $39,995, and the nicely optioned test car still only listed for $45,630. That’s thousands less than its European competitors.\n\nThe 6.1-liter version of the Hemi is the same engine used in the Chrysler 300 SRT8 and Dodge Magnum SRT8. This brute has a wonderful sound and even more satisfying manners. The dual exhausts that exit in the center of the rear fascia not only look cool, but they emit a lovely burble that is loud enough to be enjoyable yet not all all intrusive after hours at highway speeds.\n\nOne drawback to an engine with this much power is less-than-exciting gas mileage. The EPA numbers are 12 miles per gallon in the city and 15 on the highway. I beat that average while cruising at 70 or more.\n\nIt’s natural to categorize a Jeep as an off-road vehicle, and while most certainly have that capability, the only dirt the SRT8 will see is from a dusty road. The full-time four-wheel drive system is tailored for pavement use, and it does a fantastic job of putting all 420 horsepower to the pavement with very little drama. Floor the throttle from a stop and the SRT8 squirts ahead.\n\nFind a twisty country road and the SRT8 carves the turns with the grace of a figure skater. Never did I sense that I was driving a tall, heavy SUV. Rather, the SRT8 felt like a hunkered-down European sedan.\n\nThe SRT8’s cabin looks racy, but in an understated way. The light gray leather seats were deeply sculpted for great support, and the suede inserts do a nice job of holding you in place during spirited driving. The seats had a wide range of adjustment, including additional lumbar support for long drives.\n\nThe Jeep SRT8 is one of the nicest road cars in the Chrysler Group. Sometimes the biggest surprises are the ones we least expect, and I didn’t expect the SRT8 to be so terrific.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $39,995. The test car was equipped with the optional power adjustable pedals, navigation system, satellite radio, heated seats, side-curtain airbags, dual-zone air-conditioning and power sunroof. Options brought the sticker price to $45,630.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "Here’s a simple lesson in physics. The bigger and heavier the vehicle, the more fuel it takes to move it even if you choose a smaller, more fuel-efficient engine. I’m not sure how a physicist might write the formula. Maybe something like: mass plus wind resistance times the weight of your right foot equals an empty wallet at the speed of light squared. My recent experiences with a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo illustrated this lesson. Last year, I drove the revamped Grand Cherokee powered by a 4.7-liter V-8, the smaller of two V-8s offered. Gas prices already had reached $3, so I was sensitive to what this midsize SUV was guzzling. According to the EPA, the mileage rating for this vehicle is 15 mpg city and 20 highway. My results, during a week of fairly conservative driving mostly on the freeway, was a paltry 15 mpg overall, according to the on-board computer. So I wanted to compare a similar Grand Cherokee with the less powerful V-6, rated by EPA at 17 city and 21 highway. My results, according to the computer: 16 mpg. Which tells me that when you’re driving a truck that weighs quite a bit more than two tons (4,665 curb weight for the V-8 Limited and 4,441 for the V-6 Laredo), you pay through the nose for gas. Simple physics. Don’t blame the Jeep; the formula holds true for any vehicle. The Laredo proved to be a super-nice SUV in most respects, from its refined restyling to its comfortable maneuverability. The interior is really nice and everybody who rode in it liked it. I liked it, too, until it came time for another stop at the gas pump.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The newly minted 3.7-liter V-6 is a nice unit, quiet and vibration free, but it works hard to motivate this 4,400-pound SUV. Around town, it pulls well enough, but it feels sluggish at highway speeds. As noted, gas mileage is not much better than with the 4.7-liter V-8, which is considerably stronger and will tow 6,500 pounds. That’s 3,000 more than the V-6’s maximum. There’s also a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, with loads more power and worse mileage. For 2007, Grand Cherokee will be offered with a diesel engine, which typically gets improved fuel mileage. There also will be a high-performance SRT8 version, which should be fun, but don’t even ask about gas mileage.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Grand Cherokee drives and handles well, with a slightly rubbery feel to the suspension to accommodate its superior off-road abilities. The Laredo came standard with antilock disc brakes and brake assist, electronic stability program, enhanced accident response system, tire-pressure monitor and four-wheel traction control. The four-wheel drive was upgraded to Quadra-Trac II active full-time four-wheel drive. Off-road performance was impressive.\n\nSTYLING: Carrying over from 2005, Grand Cherokee shows greater styling refinement, especially in the front-end treatment.\n\nINTERIOR: Much nicer than past Grand Cherokees, with a luxury look to the dashboard and gauges and every system easy to operate and understand. The seats are comfortable and supportive, though back-seat riders are cheated on legroom. The test Jeep came with optional side airbags and curtains, definitely worth the extra cost.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Drivers of truck-based SUVs, not just those with Grand Cherokees, have to put up with the gas-mileage compromises inherent in these capable vehicles. Grand Cherokee has been greatly improved, but like all of them, still struggles with the mileage issue.\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee Laredo\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door SUV, four-wheel drive. Engine: 3.7-liter V-6, 210 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 235 pound-feet torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic. Wheelbase: 109.5 inches. Overall length: 186.6 inches. Curb weight: 4,441 pounds. Towing capacity: 3,500 pounds. EPA rating: 17 city, 21 highway.\n\nHighs: Nice interior, good drivability, off-road ability. Lows: Sluggish, mediocre gas mileage, pricey with options.",

      "expert_review": "The Jeep Grand Cherokee came to our offices in the middle of winter, and it did a very good job tackling the subzero temperatures and mounds of snow on the ground. Still, it left me wondering if I would enjoy it in the summer — or over the long term, as its reliability has been judged to be poor. That’s enough to cross most vehicles off my list right there.\n\nAlso, I must point out that this is a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and we’re well into the 2009 model year. It’s OK: The switch to digital TV isn’t messing up your internet, too. It’s just that between the 2008 and 2009 model years, the only things that changed were a new leather interior package and a redesigned Hemi, which the Jeep I drove didn’t have; my test car had the 215-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 diesel engine. So when we got a 2008 in the driveway, we thought, “We can make this work.”\n\nThink of it this way: If you want a 2009 model, all you need to do is remember those few things that have changed. If you’re looking at a 2008 model, well, we’re happy to help.\n\nExterior\nThe previous-generation Grand Cherokee always struck me as having a too-short body on a too-high chassis — sort of like someone who stands 6-foot-4 and has a 54-inch inseam. The body was just too short. The new look is much better because it’s more proportionate.\n\nStill, it is an SUV, so one would expect it not to stray beyond the standard two-boxes-stacked-on-top-of-each-other shape, and it doesn’t. It does have the traditional Jeep grille and roundish headlights, so it looks like a real Jeep, not a Johnny-come-lately imitator (that would be you, Hummer).\n\nAlso, for urban-dwellers, while it has a nice, high 8-inch ground clearance, it only stands a little more than 5 feet, 6 inches, so you don’t have to worry about it fitting into most garages.\n\nInterior\nAs noted, one of the changes this got from 2008 to 2009 was what Jeep calls an optional Leather Appearance Group on Limited and Overland models.\n\nWe had an Overland model with the old leather interior, and I have to say I was satisfied with it. Make no mistake — it’s not the interior I would choose. I don’t like light-colored interiors and I don’t like wood trim, and as you can see from the photos, this SUV had both. I’m sorry, but wood trim almost always looks like plastic to me, especially when it’s got a high-gloss finish.\n\nWhat made me like the interior was that it seemed to be good quality. The brushed-metal trim in particular looked very nice, and it also had a tasteful amount of chrome accents. Since we had the top-of-the-line model, we had three 12-volt power outlets (there are two in the base model), auto-dimming rearview and driver’s side mirrors, and an audio system with more gewgaws than I care to go into.\n\nThe cargo area deserves mention because it was large with the rear seats up, and when they were flopped over I had plenty of room for my cross-country skis. There’s also a handy “load to this line” marking, so you know just how much room you have — no gently closing the hatch and hoping/praying you don’t crush something. Finally, neither the cargo floor nor the height to which the rear hatch opens is so high that shorter people should have issues.\n\nSpeaking of the height-challenged, they’ll love the rear seat, as it’s sized just for them. Adults or long-legged children will have a hard time sitting behind a taller driver or front-seat passenger. That’s not a big deal in my blissfully unmarried state, but the married folk will want to check that out.\n\nOverall, like the exterior, what you have with the Grand Cherokee is a car that doesn’t really look like anything but what it is. There’s no faux-Euro styling, no slick, uber-technical holographic display, just simple gauges. I think it fits with the rough, tough image that Jeep likes to present.\n\nMedia\nThere are things about the Grand Cherokee I didn’t like, but the touch-screen that controls the navigation and radio was the only source of outright frustration and rage I felt. So it gets its own, brief section.\n\nThe executive summary is this: Make sure you get the optional steering-wheel audio controls and learn how to use them. Otherwise, carrying out mundane tasks, such as switching from AM to FM, requires you to take your eyes off the road and punch at least two buttons on the touch-screen. It doesn’t get easier the more often you do it.\n\nIf you’ve got the navigation system going, more touches are required to move from navigation to audio to what you wanted to do in the first place.\n\nThe steering-wheel controls, on the other hand, were extremely intuitive — I never had to look at the owner’s manual to figure them out — and I was clicking through the various audio menus quickly. I only touched the screen when I wanted to fiddle with the navigation. That was a much better way to handle things.\n\nStill, fiddling with anything on the touch-screen can be difficult because of one of the other issues with the Jeep: Its ride. The ride is stiff, so if you hit a bump it’s almost a given that your finger will slip from one tiny button on the touch-screen to some other button you don’t want. Sigh.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAs I say, the ride is an “issue,” but I can’t really fault the Grand Cherokee for it because it was only a pain when using the touch-screen. Even when driving over rough roads, it didn’t present itself as an annoyance.\n\nAlso, I think it’s fair to say that the ride is stiff because the Grand Cherokee is a fully offroad-capable SUV. So, yeah, it ain’t supple, but it is the way it is for a reason. If one wants a cushy ride, there are many, many other vehicles to try for that, but they won’t carry you through much more than a gravel driveway.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee also feels heavy, but in a good way — like it’s firmly planted on the road. That’s a welcome sensation when you’re driving through the snow, but it was the No. 1 thing whose potential annoyance I wondered about if I were to drive the Grand Cherokee when it was sunny and dry. I kept wondering if I’d want something lighter and more nimble on a nice day, or if I’d just tell myself, “Wait until winter. Things are always better with snow on the ground.” There’s just no way to answer that.\n\nAnother thing that made driving in snow easier was the fact that when you lifted off the accelerator, the Jeep slowed down. That may sound obvious, but trust me, most of the vehicles I drive these days don’t; you lift off the pedal and the car doesn’t slow, forcing you to brush the brakes. Is that the end of the world? Obviously not, but not having to touch the brakes on a snow-covered road is nice.\n\nIt should also be noted that it’s common for diesels to provide more of this so-called engine braking than gasoline versions do, so this characteristic might not be present on gas-powered Grand Cherokees.\n\nThe enhanced engine braking was one of the few ways you’d notice this SUV was a diesel. Well, yes, you’d better notice when you go to fill up at a gas station, and, yes, if you’re stopped at, say, a drive-thru or a tollbooth you will notice that the engine sounds a bit different. But it’s nowhere near as loud or annoying as most heavy-duty truck diesel engines are, and nobody is going to mistake you for an 18-wheeler. There was a bit more noise in the extreme cold, but that died down once the engine warmed up. Either way, it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nThere was a wonderful amount of torque both pulling away from lights and passing on the highway. Unlike vehicles that have to downshift, wind out the engine and scream to pass, this thing just pulls. I loved that. The diesel engine is available on all trims except the SRT8 for 2008.\n\nA final word about diesel that, if you’re experienced, you may skip: When your fuel gauge indicates you need to fill up, it’s not like you have to look for a needle in a haystack in order to find diesel fuel. I found that the farther away I got from a major metropolitan area, the more likely I was to find it. What it boils down to is this: If you’re down to a quarter tank and you see a sign that indicates the next station has diesel, pull in. Don’t push on and hope the next station will have it, too. Pick the correct pump. Now fill up. Simple as that.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the Jeep Grand Cherokee a Good rating in frontal-offset crash tests and a Marginal one in side-impact tests. (IIHS ratings are Good, Acceptable, Marginal and Poor.)\n\nSide-impact airbags that protect the torso are not present for the front seats. The Grand Cherokee does comes with side curtain airbags for both the front and rear seats, as well as a standard electronic stability system and adjustable pedals.\n\nGrand Cherokee in the Market\nBecause we had the top-of-the-line trim with all the gadgets, our Grand Cherokee was priced at $44,545, which is getting way up there in the midsize-SUV price range. That included the diesel engine option, which adds anywhere from $1,010 to $3,235 to the price, depending on what trim level you choose.\n\nI think comparing this Grand Cherokee to crossovers such as the less expensive Lexus RX 350 or Mazda CX-7 misses the boat, because neither of them is offroad capable. Compared to more offroad-capable SUVs such as the Volkswagen Touareg 2 and Nissan Xterra, however, the Jeep feels like what a Jeep should be — a bit more rugged, a bit more, well, American. It’s hard to describe, but basically you could strip away the branding, sit in this and say, “I bet this is a Jeep.” I think that kind of distinct flavor is a good thing in the market. It’s up to you if that “distinct flavor” is worth the $44,545 sticker price, especially when you consider the Xterra tops out at around $30,000.\n\nAlso — and this is a huge stumbling block for me — reliability for this model has been poor and is predicted to remain poor, according to Consumer Reports. With that in mind, the price looks much, much worse, especially given the fact that many of its cheaper competitors are more reliable. For instance, the Xterra is predicted by Consumer Reports to have better than average reliability. (Interestingly, the Touareg 2 tops out at nearly $49,000 and is also predicted to have much worse than average reliability.)\n\nI guess what it comes down to is this: Are you willing to chance the poor reliability to get the offroad capability and personality? I’m pretty sure I’m not, especially in light of the Jeep’s $44,000-plus price. A car that goes well in winter is only good if it actually goes.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "There’s little doubt about the power of the Jeep name.\n\nDuring World War II, foreign correspondent Ernie Pyle described the U.S. Army vehicle as being “faithful as a dog, as strong as a mule and as agile as a goat.” Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, Allied Supreme Commander in Europe, said after the war “the Jeep, the Dakota airplane and the landing craft were the three tools that won the war.”\n\nThe 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland edition may be the SUV that wins over luxury import buyers. With a sticker price of nearly $40,000, the Overland is aimed at such popular foreign brands as the Mercedes-Benz ML320, Lexus RX300 and Acura MDX.\n\nHe: Funny that Jeep should resurrect the Overland name, which even predates Willys, the original manufacturer of the World War II Jeep. I suppose that the Overland brand is so old, nobody remembers just what it stood for, so when Jeep wanted to create a new premium trim package for the Grand Cherokee above the Limited, that name worked as well as any. I just think it’s ironic that DaimlerChrysler is trying to stretch the Jeep brand and position it against luxury imports, considering Jeep’s blue-collar roots as a military vehicle that helped the Americans win the war. Ironic, too, that one of its potential competitors, the ML320, is owned by the same parent company in Germany. What would Ernie Pyle say about THAT?\n\nShe: I’m far too young to remember Overland or World War II. But I’ll tell you what. I felt like a rich woman driving this Jeep. And it’s a head-turner, with that new Inferno Red Pearl exterior paint job and the deluxe cabin with redwood trim and perforated leather. I’m a little less impressed with the front seats. They almost have a bit of a ’70s Barcalounger look to them. The hardest task for DaimlerChrysler will be convincing import buyers to take this high-priced Jeep seriously.\n\nHe: You know Jeep is serious when they put the new high-output 4.7-liter V-8 into the Overland. It kicks out 260 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque — output figures that dwarf much of the import competition in this price segment. I was even a bit surprised at the EPA fuel-economy figures — 14 miles per gallon in city driving and 19 on the highway — which are not spectacular, but still impressive for a big V-8 that churns out this kind of power. The Grand Cherokee’s quadra-coil suspension also is one of the most compliant in the class, although you still won’t feel as comfortable as you will in a car-based crossover like the MDX or the RX300.\n\nShe: This Jeep is still a truck that’s capable of serious off-road use. You have to climb up into it, so if ease of entry is a major consideration, a crossover-type vehicle like the RX300 is probably a better choice. But the Overland is worth a close look if you want a vehicle that’s nice enough to take your friends out to a fancy dinner, but you still want to do some serious outdoorsy stuff like camping or towing a boat. The ride on the Jeep is a bit bo uncy and we both noticed some wind noise at highway speed and really excessive driveline noise at lower speeds.\n\nHe: I didn’t really have many other complaints with the Grand Cherokee, which is assembled right here in Detroit and looks to be up to pretty high quality standards. One of my biggest problems was forward visibility. You sit high in the driver’s seat, and the top of the windshield is low enough that taller persons will find their vision cut off — a big concern when you pull up to a traffic light. A minor annoyance is the location of the 10-CD changer, way back in the cargo bay, which makes it inaccessible even to your passengers until you pull over and lift the tailgate. That’s a dumb design.\n\nShe: I was impressed with the safety features, especially the $185 power adjustable pedals with memory. That’s a safety feature because it gets women and smaller people away from the driver’s air bag. You’re not on top of the steering wheel. The pedals move forward as much as three inches using a switch. And there’s a new $150 tire-pressure monitoring system that warns you if your pressure is low.\n\nHe: If you have 40 grand to spend on an SUV and you’re into the Jeep’s all-American legacy — and don’t have a problem with its current German parentage — the Grand Cherokee Overland is well worth considering.\n\nAnita’s rating: (Above average)\n\nPaul’s rating (Above average)\n\nLikes: Terrific new high-output 4.7-liter V-8 delivers 260 hp. Plush luxury-car cabin with perforated-leather upholstery and redwood trim. Relatively smooth ride for an SUV (Paul). New power adjustable pedals with his-and-her memory settings. Good safety features include side air curtains, rain-sensitive wipers and optional tire-pressure monitoring system. Love the electro-luminescent gauges with stylish ecru background (Anita). Handsome chromed aluminum wheels.\n\nDislikes: For nearly $40,000, you could own a Mercedes ML320, a Lexus RX300 or an Acura MDX. Ride feels too bouncy (Anita). Barcalounger-type seats remind me of parents’ den (Anita). Felt like I was perched on front seat, rather than being enveloped (Anita). 10-CD changer is in the cargo bay. Excessive driveline noise and wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger utility vehicle.\n\nPrice: Base, $36,905; as tested, $39,205 (inc. $600 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 4.7-liter V-8; 260-hp; 330 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 mpg city/19 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,437 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Detroit",

      "expert_review": "I think of the Jeep Grand Cherokee as the original SUV; it’s the SUV everyone had before everyone had SUVs. It’s still popular today with plenty of moms. The Grand Cherokee provides ample room for a family of four without being too cumbersome. It’s comfortable and stylish without being obnoxiously overloaded, and it has a reassuring steadiness under the toughest road conditions.\n\nI do have one major issue with the 2009 Grand Cherokee, though, and that’s its fuel economy, estimated at 14/19 mpg city/highway (and realistically below that). I had to fill ‘er up twice in one week, and that did not make this mama happy. My test car was flex-fuel capable – meaning you can fill it with E85 ethanol – but even that didn’t inspire warm fuzzies. When using ethanol, the Grand Cherokee’s fuel economy is an EPA-estimated 9/13 mpg. Not good. The whole ethanol situation needs to be tweaked a few hundred times before we consider it as the savior to our fossil-fuel dependency. I’m not counting it out entirely, I’m simply suggesting that some work needs to be done.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 2009 Grand Cherokee’s exterior doesn’t look much different from the 1999 Grand Cherokee that my husband drove when I first met him. Apparently, my taste in cars and men hasn’t changed, as I liked the look of both back then and still do today (one might argue that my husband might even look better, since the love of a good woman is bound to make any man shine).\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has that classic seven-slot grille that’s become a Jeep trademark, and a relatively compact body (at least compared to others in this segment, like the Ford Explorer or Toyota 4Runner). It fit into my garage easily, offering plenty of room to get myself and the kids in and out of the car, even with my husband’s SUV parked there. A word of caution: The doors are really heavy. It’s almost guaranteed that one of your kids will bonk their head on them, so watch out for your little ones.\n\nThe 4.7-liter V-8 engine gives the Grand Cherokee some punch, but it’s that same engine that hungrily eats gas. I’m always conflicted about powerful engines: I get the allure of power and I enjoy being behind the wheel of such a powerful engine, but I really hate the gas-guzzling. I don’t like having to fill up my tank very often, and I prefer to be a bit more green in my car choices.\n\nI’m totally into the cool things manufacturers are doing with headlights these days, and the Grand Cherokee is no exception in this arena. The SmartBeam headlights that come standard on the Grand Cherokee Limited automatically adjust the high-beams’ brightness when oncoming traffic approaches. With my horrible night vision, these smart headlights are immensely useful.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nCompared with other cars I’ve tested recently, the 2009 Grand Cherokee seemed almost barren on the inside. It’s not that the variety of accoutrements isn’t sufficient, it’s just that they aren’t presented in a flashy way. Your eyes aren’t immediately blinded by a large and glowing nav/entertainment system, which gives you the freedom to look elsewhere – like the road, for instance. What a novel idea.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, every techie thing you need is there, it’s just packaged in a more Spartan manner than seems to be the fashion these days. There’s Bluetooth connectivity; Sirius Satellite Radio and traffic service included for one year; a universal garage door opener; and the ever-handy navigation system with a screen that’s just the right size. You also can opt for the second-row 9-inch overhead TV, although my test car wasn’t equipped with it.\n\nThe front seats are reasonably comfortable, with a standard eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a four-way power-adjustable passenger’s seat. The two-tone leather that covered the seats in my test car was stylish and soft to the touch. They were so pretty that it left me wondering how easily they’d clean if someone, say, spilled a drink or left a lollipop to melt on them. Fortunately, my son didn’t offer me the opportunity to find out, but I was able to easily remove a teeny, tiny speck of chai that found its way onto the driver’s seat.\n\nSpeaking of two-toned things, the Grand Cherokee has a two-tone instrument panel with a darker top portion that not only creates an elegant look, it also reduces glare from the sun. That was very useful here in sunny Colorado.\n\nPower-adjustable pedals are also featured on the Grand Cherokee, which is a brilliant feature for those of you who are on the petite side. The second row is roomy, and I was able to easily fit between my kids’ car seats. I found the SUV to have plenty of cargo space.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nJeep began including side-impact airbags as standard on the Grand Cherokee beginning in 2007. There appears to be some room for improvement, however, because the Grand Cherokee received a Marginal score in crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. I’d love to see Jeep improve upon those results so they can achieve the highest safety rating in the side-impact category. There’s no reason a car this large and seemingly sturdy shouldn’t protect its passengers completely.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system, electronic stability system and traction control all work together to make the Grand Cherokee a sturdy ride. I always felt safe driving it, even in the ice and snow that greeted us one day. Added to this sturdy extravaganza are Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, which come standard with all-wheel drive and are designed to keep the Grand Cherokee slow and steady when traversing difficult terrain, and keep it from rolling backward on an incline, respectively.\n\nAntilock brakes and a tire pressure monitoring system are standard, as is a smart key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt. My test car also had a rear backup camera, which is optional, but something I’m beginning to think should one day be standard.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers, In School, Teens: There’s plenty of room in the backseat for kids of all sizes.",

      "expert_review": "The following is a true story: While trying to access the lower Latch anchors in the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, my favorite sunglasses fell off my head and onto the ground; in the heat of my efforts — hands trying unsuccessfully to clip my daughter’s car seat in and feet stomping in frustration — I stepped on my favorite sunglasses and smooshed them. They’re ruined. I’m sad.\n\nMoral: Latch anchors need to be easier to access and use. Jeep isn’t the only manufacturer guilty of producing almost-impossible Latch anchors, so my apologies for singling Jeep out, but the 2011 Grand Cherokee has the misfortune of being the one that led to the broken sunglasses.\n\nAside from the Latch issue, the 2011 Grand Cherokee is a stylish, roomy, comfortable and practical SUV. It’s also rather luxurious. Given my troubles with the Latch anchors, I might recommend it more for folks who don’t need to use the Latch system, lest any other favorite sunglasses get smooshed.\n\nThe 2011 Grand Cherokee has been redesigned, and it now has a crossover-like feel due to a new four-wheel-independent suspension. There’s also more room for folks in the backseat and for cargo in the rear, both of which are always a good thing. A Selec-Terrain system that helps you and the car adapt to different driving conditions is new this year as well as an optional 5.7-liter V-8 engine.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee starts at $30,215. I tested the midlevel Limited trim with all-wheel drive, which starts at $39,215. In addition to the larger 5.7-liter engine, my test car had some other near-necessary options like a blind spot warning system, a power liftgate and cooled front seats, bringing the total price up to $43,885. \n \nEXTERIOR\n\nAt first sight, I thought the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee was a Porsche Cayenne. With a second glance, I noticed the distinctive front grille and realized that this was indeed a Grand Cherokee. It just looked better than ever. The softened exterior lines, sparkly chrome trim and large wheels housed under conspicuous fenders work together for a “wow” factor that I’ve never previously gotten from a Jeep. The 2011 redesign makes the Grand Cherokee look more like a crossover than an SUV, and crossover looks good on this Jeep.\n\nBecause of this redesign my children had an easier time getting in and out of the Grand Cherokee. It sits lower to the ground than a traditional SUV. Another bonus was the doors weren’t unusually heavy, which worked well with the children.\n\nI don’t want to get too girly here, but the Blackberry Pearl paint color of my test car is worth mentioning. In a word: gorgeous. It was a deep, dark greenish-blue that resembled the deepest depths of the ocean (as I imagine them).\n\nMy test car had the optional 5.7-liter V-8 engine ($1,495), which includes a slick pair of rear exhaust tips with it. This engine produces 360 horsepower and moved the SUV around easily. The standard engine is a 3.6-liter V-6 that delivers 290 hp. The Grand Cherokee Limited I tested had all-wheel drive, but it’s also available in rear-wheel drive.\n\nWith the addition of the larger 5.7-liter engine and all-wheel drive, fuel economy in my test car was a less-than-impressive EPA-estimated 13/19 mpg city/highway using regular gas. With rear-wheel drive, the V-8 engine gets 14/20 mpg. When equipped with the standard V-6 and all-wheel drive, the Grand Cherokee gets 16/22 mpg. It gets 1 mpg better on the highway with the V-6 and rear-wheel drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe 2011 Grand Cherokee’s cabin is easy on the eyes and soft to the touch. The wood-grain and chrome trim is sexy and the leather-trimmed seats are comfortable. Front and rear seats and the steering wheel are all heated, which makes any Colorado family like mine happy. My test car even had the optional ventilated front seats, which would be a welcome blast of fresh air during the hot summers.\n\nMy test SUV had the Rear DVD Entertainment Center package with Sirius Backseat TV that features kids’ channels including Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. While I may be conflicted about the necessity of in-car television, my children thought it was beyond cool. The entertainment package also includes wireless headphones so you can enjoy the silence and try to forget that you could be creating couch potatoes on wheels. In the realm of other family-friendly entertainment features, the 2011 Grand Cherokee also comes with Jeep’s user-friendly Uconnect system that allows you to navigate, call your friends and play your favorite tunes from the comfort of the driver’s seat.\n\nThere are cupholders for everyone — in the center of both the front and rear seats as well as on the doors — and a generous center storage cubby up front.\n\nThere’s plenty of room for your gear as rear cargo volume clocks in at more than 35 cubic feet with the second row up and almost 69 cubic feet with the second row down. There’s also a built-in flashlight in the rear cargo area that’s a welcome addition to any family car — no matter if you end up using it to fix a flat at night or simply entertain the kids with ghost stories during a long road trip.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2011 Grand Cherokee has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests as well as have a standard electronic stability system.\n\nIn addition to the electronic stability system, the Grand Cherokee also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, anti-roll control, traction control, active head restraints, rear-wheel drive, a backup camera with rear sensors and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seat and side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional safety features include a backup camera with front and rear sensors, all-wheel drive and an Adaptive Warning/Adaptive Cruise Control package that includes a blind spot monitoring system, adaptive cruise control, collision alert and Cross Path detection, which alerts the driver about oncoming traffic when pulling out of a parking spot.\n\nI’m not a fan of the Grand Cherokee’s two sets of lower Latch anchors for obvious reasons. Two words: smooshed sunglasses. They’re difficult to use. I wasn’t able to fit my three car seats into the SUV, but the car seat testers in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check were able to fit their three car seats in it, which shows you that you should take your car seats with you if you’re planning to take a test drive.\n\nAccording to Jeep, backseat legroom has been upped by more than 3 inches this year, but I found the legroom to be a bit tight with car seats installed. Thankfully, my children have little legs, so it wasn’t a problem.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee here.",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler’s 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee pretty much saved the company’s bacon as it struggled to pull itself out of a demoralizing bankruptcy. Now Jeep is presenting a refreshed 2014 Grand Cherokee even as the old one is still propelling the brand to record sales numbers, and the problem is this: How do you improve on what is already a good thing?\n\nThe 2014 Grand Cherokee is a subtle refresh, with money spent simply on what needed improvement, and the result is now one of the best vehicles Jeep has ever made.\n\nI tested multiple trim levels and all four available engines, including the high-performance SRT Grand Cherokee.\n\nMore Power, More Choices\nThe biggest changes to the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee over the previous model are mechanical (click here to compare 2013 to 2014 models). Two engines are carried over from 2013: a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 making 290 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque and a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 pumping out 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque. Now added to the mix is a new 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6, making only 240 hp but churning out a huge 420 pounds-feet of torque. All engines are now teamed with Chrysler’s increasingly common 8-speed automatic transmission, replacing the earlier six-speed. Both the EcoDiesel and the Hemi are tow-rated to 7,200 pounds in 4×4 versions or 7,400 pounds with rear-wheel drive, but the diesel’s advantage will be fuel economy. Preliminary estimates put Hemi mileage at 14/22 mpg city/highway (4×2) and 14/20 mpg (4×4), but the diesel is expected to turn in a stunning 22/30 mpg (4×2) and 21/28 mpg (4×4) with a range of more than 730 miles.\n\nAs with the current Grand Cherokee, the 2014 model boasts three optional four-wheel-drive systems, an available adjustable air suspension and a traction management system. Quadra-Trac I provides full-time all-wheel drive; Quadra-Trac II adds a two-speed transfer case with a low range; and Quadra-Drive II builds on that by adding an electronic limited-slip differential. The Quadra-Lift air suspension raises the Grand Cherokee’s ground clearance by 3.9 inches from its normal height to 11.3 inches for off-road use or down 0.6 inch for high-speed aerodynamic improvement. It can come down another full inch when parked to allow easier entry, exit and loading.\n\nThe Selec-Terrain system has five driver-selectable terrain modes that correspond to potential conditions: Sand, Mud, Auto, Snow or Rock. Each electronically activates the appropriate combination of 12 different powertrain, brake and suspension settings to optimize traction and ground clearance.\n\nHow It Goes, Stops and Climbs\nI sampled both the EcoDiesel and Hemi V-8 on-road and drove the V-6 Pentastar in Jeep’s off-road testing route at a press introduction in the hill country around Austin, Texas. The Hemi is powerful, throaty and smooth with the new eight-speed automatic. But the diesel is the one to have — as an option on the Limited, Overland or Summit trim levels only — despite a hefty upcharge: $4,500 more than the V-6 and $2,300 more than the Hemi option. The immediacy of the diesel’s torque is impressive. One never forgets that this is a diesel; while Jeep has done a commendable job damping the distinctive clatter from the motor, full-throttle applications sound like a tractor-pull at the county fair. The thing is, in a big SUV like this, that diesel rumble actually puts a grin on your face. In highway cruising situations, the diesel is whisper quiet and unobtrusive. Combined with its best-in-class highway fuel economy, it could prove to be a popular option for buyers interested in efficient towing or highway commuting.\n\nIn normal driving, there’s a fair degree of body roll, and the heavy truck tends to understeer through corners. The Grand Cherokee in its Normal mode is tuned more for a comfortable ride than for athletic moves. But Sport mode is now available across the lineup, engaged with a pull on the transmission handle. In Grand Cherokees equipped with the air suspension, Sport mode wakes up the truck and transforms it significantly, changing shift patterns, suspension settings and ride height to minimize body roll and create a more surefooted performance in fast twisties. In models without the air suspension, only the transmission behavior and throttle response change. Steering-wheel paddle shifters are also present. The Grand Cherokee exudes a quiet solidity regardless of trim level; even in our preproduction test vehicles, nothing squeaked, rattled or otherwise felt misassembled. If these early build vehicles are an indication, quality should be top notch.\n\nOff-road, the Grand Cherokee remains one of the most capable all-terrain-vehicles ever made — not that 99% of Grand Cherokee owners will ever experience this. The V-6 proved plenty powerful, and the selectable-mode four-wheel drive enabled me to drive up and down a 43-degree rock face, not to mention other terrain you would have trouble even walking over.\n\nA No-Excuses Interior\nThe biggest gripe about the previous model’s interior has been quashed — gone is the old, unloved touch-screen system, and in its place is the Chrysler family Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen that has won our praise in other applications like the Dodge Dart (see an evaluation) and Charger. It remains one of the best systems on the market: big, easy to use, quick and uncomplicated. This is how to do in-vehicle connectivity right. Surrounding that screen is an updated instrument panel with even nicer materials, including some pretty adventurous color options. Check out the copper metallic trim. Or how about Indigo Blue leather? Available in the newest top-of-the-line trim level, called Summit, these options lend a high-quality look to an already impressive interior covered in stitched leather and open-pore wood trim. Another carryover from the Dart is the reconfigurable center gauge cluster with a 7-inch LCD display screen and fully digital speedometer, which displays far more information than the typical driver is likely to need.\n\nThe seats are all-day comfortable, front and rear, available in top-quality premium leather, with more optional stitched leather covering the dash in higher trims. The rear seats feature a 60/40 fold-down split to create a flat load floor, with 68.7 cubic feet of cargo room with the seats folded and 35.1 cubic feet with the rear seats in place. There are no flimsy controls or stalks, no complicated or cluttered buttons and, frankly, very little to criticize. The Summit trim even has a suedelike headliner and a phenomenal 19-speaker Harman Kardon sound system that ranks as one of the best I’ve ever heard in an automobile. These are seriously nice trucks, even in base Laredo trim, raising the benchmark for affordable SUV interiors yet again.\n\nSRT: The Wild Child\nAs much fun as the new Jeep Grand Cherokee is off-road, there’s also a new SRT high-performance street version arriving just one month after the more conventional versions hit the streets. The 2014 SRT Grand Cherokee (the “8” has been dropped from the name) is just plain wicked. Its styling is subtle with a blacked-out grille and smoked headlights and taillamps, optional black chrome wheels, a lower stance and wider wheels and tires. Its tuning makes it one of the most outrageous American performance vehicles on the market. Power comes from a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 engine making 470 hp and 465 pounds-feet of torque delivered through the eight-speed automatic to all four wheels. Jeep rates the SRT Grand Cherokee at 4.8 seconds from zero to 60 mph, but I discovered that this is a conservative figure: Using the SRT’s onboard software and a special launch button, I was able to consistently rip off 4.5-second zero-to-60 times, and SRT engineers say that they’ve been able to achieve 60 mph in 4.2 seconds under perfect conditions.\n\nOn public roads, SRT Grand Cherokee’s presence and swagger are formidable. Its bulldog stance and fat tires combine with the absolutely primal bellow from its Hemi engine to make every routine errand an event. The suedelike sport seats are amazingly comfortable and grippy yet not rock solid and unyielding or too narrow and overbolstered like so many other high-performance vehicles. Wood trim is replaced by decent carbon fiber, and a special suite of SRT applications for the 8.4-inch touch-screen bring all sorts of special gauges, timers and G-force meters to the SUV to allow drivers to monitor and even wirelessly upload and share their achieved performance numbers. Jeep rented out the Circuit of The Americas Formula 1 track in Austin and brought a dozen SRT Grand Cherokees for journalists to flog, proving that the massive SUV can handle itself quite well should its owners want to use their truck both for towing a car to the track and racing the tow vehicle itself.\n\nSafety\nThe new Jeep Grand Cherokee scored five stars in the side-impact crash test by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but its rollover-resistance rating is three stars for the two-wheel-drive version, which is one star below most SUVs, and four stars in the four-wheel-drive version. A full list of electronic safety aids is standard, including antilock brakes with stability control, hill start assist and trailer-sway control. Full-length side-curtain airbags are standard, as are front-seat-mounted side thorax airbags. The list of optional features is also long: ParkSense detector systems, blind spot warning with rear cross-path detection, forward collision warning with automatic braking and 911 crash detection with the Uconnect system. See all the safety features listed here.\n\nIn the Market\nJeep has not yet found the upper limit for what it can charge for the Grand Cherokee, as customers have been snapping up the loaded Overland trim level at an astonishing rate. For 2014, the Summit trim level has been added above that, which really piles on the luxury trimmings. Four trim levels are available, starting with the Laredo at $29,790, moving up to the Limited at $36,790, then the Overland at $43,990, and topping things off is the new Summit at $48,990 (all prices include a $995 destination charge). A loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit is expected to easily top $53,000, and the entry price to get a diesel-equipped model would be a Limited for $41,290. To get in the fire-breathing SRT, however, you must shell out $63,990, but it is unlikely that this lofty sum will put a damper on sales, and Jeep is capping production at just 5,000 units per year.\n\nPricing like this pits theJeep  Grand Cherokee against competitors like the Ford Explorer, albeit with a seating deficiency – the Grand Cherokee seats only five to the Explorer’s standard seven. The Grand Cherokee makes up for it in other ways, however, such as off-road prowess, interior comfort, a much easier to use touch-screen and the unique addition of the diesel engine. The rear-wheel-drive layout of the Grand Cherokee would naturally pit it against Toyota’s trucklike 4Runner, but its sales volume and popularity make it more of a match for the Highlander crossover. The Grand Cherokee comes out ahead here as well, with a higher quality interior and more advanced equipment. For roughly the same price as the Highlander Hybrid, the Grand Cherokee Limited EcoDiesel achieves an estimated 2 mpg better highway mileage with a far more powerful engine able to tow more than twice the Highlander Hybrid’s 3,500-pound limit. See how Grand Cherokee stacks up against competitors here.\n\nFor many customers, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a second vehicle to complement their much more expensive luxury car, meaning Jeep has to hold its SUV to a higher standard than some of its lesser models in order to maintain its cachet. With this latest 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep has successfully done exactly that.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "We’ve all known someone who seems to have it all. Remember your school pal who was attractive, affable and athletic? You wanted to hate him, but it was impossible because he was just too charismatic. Of course, forgoing resentment was easier when you found out he had one shortcoming … his marks in school weren’t top-notch. Nonetheless, poor grades weren’t the sort of thing you’d hold against this guy because he was too great to have around.\n\nLike that friend, the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 seems to have it all — it’s attractive, spacious, athletic and incredibly likable. However, the Grand Cherokee SRT8 gets low marks in fuel economy.\n\nBecause it’s a high-performance SRT8 trim, this Grand Cherokee goes from zero to 60 mph in a mere 4.8 seconds, which is only a bit longer than it takes many fancy sports cars and the SRT offers a lot more space. In addition to having a multitude of family-friendly attributes, this is a two-row crossover that demands to be driven, and its 6.4-liter V-8 roars with delight when you step on the gas. Road and engine noise are kept to a minimum, and if you want to hear the roar of the V-8, simply roll down your window. There are steering-wheel paddle shifters in case you decide to get sporty while driving the kids to and from school, and trust me, you might.\n\nBeing friends with the guy who had it all always came with perks, whether it was access to his mountain house or getting into the best parties. The 2012 Grand Cherokee SRT8 comes with perks as well. One of the best of those is the SRT Track Experience, which is a day at a high-performance driving school where you get to develop your own set of skills on the track.\n\nThe 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee base starts at $28,120, including a $925 destination charge. The top-of-the-line SRT8 trim has a starting price of $55,595. With the addition of a few options packages that added a DVD entertainment system, performance audio and extra safety features, my test car’s price was $65,275.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Grand Cherokee has always possessed an attractive exterior. The 2012 SRT8 trim augments that with a more aggressive front grille and bumper as well as a hood that’s as sculpted as your old school chum’s muscles. A couple of heat extractors on the hood are a telltale sign of the car’s fiery engine and beastly 20-inch forged aluminum wheels add to its athletic charm.\n\nIn the rear, there’s a body-colored spoiler, fierce-looking dual exhaust and a power liftgate. My test car was equipped with the available towing package that enables towing of up to 5,000 pounds. The cargo area has 35.1 cubic feet behind the second row and nearly 69 cubic feet with the 60/40-split backseat folded flat.\n\nThe SRT8 sits slightly lower than other Grand Cherokees. This matters for form and performance, but not necessarily for function. The SRT8 has a step-in height on the tall side, so you’ll have to give small children a boost to climb in. You’ll also have to help them with the doors as they’re quite heavy and tossed even my 5-year-old around.\n\nThe entry-level Grand Cherokee has a 3.6-liter V-6 engine that produces a healthy 290 horsepower, but the SRT8 puts you in control of a 6.4-liter V-8 that makes a glorious 470 hp and uses premium gas. The SRT8’s engine is matched to a five-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. The Grand Cherokee SRT8 gets an EPA-estimated 12/18 mpg city/highway. Grand Cherokees with the V-6 and four-wheel drive get 16/23 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nLike your old pal, the Grand Cherokee SRT8 possesses both inner and outer appeal. One of the things I like most about the SRT8’s interior is the Nappa leather and faux-suede seats. These supple seats have grip without stick and offer comfort in every seating position. Both front and rear seats are heated, and ventilation is standard on the front seats.\n\nAs for the remainder of the cabin, elegant touches like subtle-looking wood panels trim the doors, and the optional leather-wrapped dash creates a softer look and feel than expected from such a sporty car. Italicized numbers in the circular gauges are a reminder that this is no ordinary family hauler, though it’s a fast one.\n\nThe five-seater comes with a 6.5-inch touch-screen that acts as central command for Jeep’s Uconnect system with smartphone, music and navigation integration. I find Uconnect easy to use, which means I never have to reference the owner’s manual or pull over to figure things out. My test car came with an upgraded 19-speaker audio system and 825-watt amplifier and an available DVD entertainment system.\n\nWhile everyone can sit comfortably for long stretches in the SRT8, there isn’t quite enough space to fit three child-safety seats across the back row, but you can fit a larger child, who’s out of his booster seat, between two convertible seats comfortably. Additionally, the installation of a rear-facing infant seat won’t compromise front legroom.\n\nStorage is plentiful. The front center console and rear center armrest also have interior storage for smaller things, and a large glove box comes in handy for other odds and ends. There are four cupholders and four in-door bottleholders throughout the cabin.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Grand Cherokee has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This means it received the top score of Good across the front, side, rear and roof-strength crash-test categories. The Grand Cherokee received an overall safety score of four stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It also earned four stars in front and rollover crash tests and five stars in side-impact crash tests.\n\nThe SRT8 comes equipped with all the standard safety features that you’d expect such as four-wheel drive, an electronic stability system with antiroll control and traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags.\n\nBut there are other safety features that deserve mention both for their practical and performance-related applications. For the practical-minded and those of us with children, there’s standard rear park assist, a backup camera and keyless entry. A blind spot warning system, rear cross-path detection and collision alert are available. For the performance-minded, features like electronic limited slip rear differential and Brembo-brand four-wheel-disc antilock brakes make sure things stop and go as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has two sets of lower Latch anchors, but they’re difficult to use because they seem too close together. This means that a child’s car seat covers them, making it tough to get everything properly installed. The tether anchors’ placement are also puzzling as they’re covered by a snapping (as in ouch! if it snaps at you) flap cover whose movement is hindered by the monstrous rear wheel wells. The snappy flaps are there to ensure everything is nice and flat when you fold the rear seats. They work well for that, but more thought to tether-anchor placement in the future would be appreciated since there are folks who would love to have a car that accommodates their children as well as their lust for power. After all, we parents have to take power wherever we can get it.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2013 about the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nChrysler’s 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee pretty much saved the company’s bacon as it struggled to pull itself out of a demoralizing bankruptcy. Now Jeep is presenting a refreshed 2014 Grand Cherokee even as the old one is still propelling the brand to record sales numbers, and the problem is this: How do you improve on what is already a good thing?\n\nThe 2014 Grand Cherokee is a subtle refresh, with money spent simply on what needed improvement, and the result is now one of the best vehicles Jeep has ever made.\n\nI tested multiple trim levels and all four available engines, including the high-performance SRT Grand Cherokee.\n\nMore Power, More Choices\nThe biggest changes to the 2014 Grand Cherokee over the previous model are mechanical (click here to compare 2013 to 2014 models). Two engines are carried over from 2013: a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 making 290 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque and a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 pumping out 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque. Now added to the mix is a new 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6, making only 240 hp but churning out a huge 420 pounds-feet of torque. All engines are now teamed with Chrysler’s increasingly common eight-speed automatic transmission, replacing the earlier six-speed. Both the EcoDiesel and the Hemi are tow-rated to 7,200 pounds in 4×4 versions or 7,400 pounds with rear-wheel drive, but the diesel’s advantage will be fuel economy. Preliminary estimates put Hemi mileage at 14/22 mpg city/highway (4×2) and 14/20 mpg (4×4), but the diesel is expected to turn in a stunning 22/30 mpg (4×2) and 21/28 mpg (4×4) with a range of more than 730 miles.\n\nAs with the current Grand Cherokee, the 2014 model boasts three optional four-wheel-drive systems, an available adjustable air suspension and a traction management system. Quadra-Trac I provides full-time all-wheel drive; Quadra-Trac II adds a two-speed transfer case with a low range; and Quadra-Drive II builds on that by adding an electronic limited-slip differential. The Quadra-Lift air suspension raises the Grand Cherokee’s ground clearance by 3.9 inches from its normal height to 11.3 inches for off-road use or down 0.6 inch for high-speed aerodynamic improvement. It can come down another full inch when parked to allow easier entry, exit and loading.\n\nThe Selec-Terrain system has five driver-selectable terrain modes that correspond to potential conditions: Sand, Mud, Auto, Snow or Rock. Each electronically activates the appropriate combination of 12 different powertrain, brake and suspension settings to optimize traction and ground clearance.\n\nHow It Goes, Stops and Climbs\nI sampled both the EcoDiesel and Hemi V-8 on-road and drove the V-6 Pentastar in Jeep’s off-road testing route at a press introduction in the hill country around Austin, Texas. The Hemi is powerful, throaty and smooth with the new eight-speed automatic. But the diesel is the one to have — as an option on the Limited, Overland or Summit trim levels only — despite a hefty upcharge: $4,500 more than the V-6 and $2,300 more than the Hemi option. The immediacy of the diesel’s torque is impressive. One never forgets that this is a diesel; while Jeep has done a commendable job damping the distinctive clatter from the motor, full-throttle applications sound like a tractor-pull at the county fair. The thing is, in a big SUV like this, that diesel rumble actually puts a grin on your face. In highway cruising situations, the diesel is whisper quiet and unobtrusive. Combined with its best-in-class highway fuel economy, it could prove to be a popular option for buyers interested in efficient towing or highway commuting.\n\nIn normal driving, there’s a fair degree of body roll, and the heavy truck tends to understeer through corners. The Grand Cherokee in its Normal mode is tuned more for a comfortable ride than for athletic moves. But Sport mode is now available across the lineup, engaged with a pull on the transmission handle. In Grand Cherokees equipped with the air suspension, Sport mode wakes up the truck and transforms it significantly, changing shift patterns, suspension settings and ride height to minimize body roll and create a more surefooted performance in fast twisties. In models without the air suspension, only the transmission behavior and throttle response change. Steering-wheel paddle shifters are also present. The Grand Cherokee exudes a quiet solidity regardless of trim level; even in our preproduction test vehicles, nothing squeaked, rattled or otherwise felt misassembled. If these early build vehicles are an indication, quality should be top notch.\n\nOff-road, the Grand Cherokee remains one of the most capable all-terrain-vehicles ever made — not that 99% of Grand Cherokee owners will ever experience this. The V-6 proved plenty powerful, and the selectable-mode four-wheel drive enabled me to drive up and down a 43-degree rock face, not to mention other terrain you would have trouble even walking over.\n\nA No-Excuses Interior\nThe biggest gripe about the previous model’s interior has been quashed — gone is the old, unloved touch-screen system, and in its place is the Chrysler family Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen that has won our praise in other applications like the Dodge Dart (see an evaluation) and Charger. It remains one of the best systems on the market: big, easy to use, quick and uncomplicated. This is how to do in-vehicle connectivity right. Surrounding that screen is an updated instrument panel with even nicer materials, including some pretty adventurous color options. Check out the copper metallic trim. Or how about Indigo Blue leather? Available in the newest top-of-the-line trim level, called Summit, these options lend a high-quality look to an already impressive interior covered in stitched leather and open-pore wood trim. Another carryover from the Dart is the reconfigurable center gauge cluster with a 7-inch LCD display screen and fully digital speedometer, which displays far more information than the typical driver is likely to need.\n\nThe seats are all-day comfortable, front and rear, available in top-quality premium leather, with more optional stitched leather covering the dash in higher trims. The rear seats feature a 60/40 fold-down split to create a flat load floor, with 68.7 cubic feet of cargo room with the seats folded and 35.1 cubic feet with the rear seats in place. There are no flimsy controls or stalks, no complicated or cluttered buttons and, frankly, very little to criticize. The Summit trim even has a suedelike headliner and a phenomenal 19-speaker Harman Kardon sound system that ranks as one of the best I’ve ever heard in an automobile. These are seriously nice trucks, even in base Laredo trim, raising the benchmark for affordable SUV interiors yet again.\n\nSRT: The Wild Child\nAs much fun as the new Grand Cherokee is off-road, there’s also a new SRT high-performance street version arriving just one month after the more conventional versions hit the streets. The 2014 SRT Grand Cherokee (the “8” has been dropped from the name) is just plain wicked. Its styling is subtle with a blacked-out grille and smoked headlights and taillamps, optional black chrome wheels, a lower stance and wider wheels and tires. Its tuning makes it one of the most outrageous American performance vehicles on the market. Power comes from a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 engine making 470 hp and 465 pounds-feet of torque delivered through the eight-speed automatic to all four wheels. Jeep rates the SRT Grand Cherokee at 4.8 seconds from zero to 60 mph, but I discovered that this is a conservative figure: Using the SRT’s onboard software and a special launch button, I was able to consistently rip off 4.5-second zero-to-60 times, and SRT engineers say that they’ve been able to achieve 60 mph in 4.2 seconds under perfect conditions.\n\nOn public roads, SRT Grand Cherokee’s presence and swagger are formidable. Its bulldog stance and fat tires combine with the absolutely primal bellow from its Hemi engine to make every routine errand an event. The suedelike sport seats are amazingly comfortable and grippy yet not rock solid and unyielding or too narrow and overbolstered like so many other high-performance vehicles. Wood trim is replaced by decent carbon fiber, and a special suite of SRT applications for the 8.4-inch touch-screen bring all sorts of special gauges, timers and G-force meters to the SUV to allow drivers to monitor and even wirelessly upload and share their achieved performance numbers. Jeep rented out the Circuit of The Americas Formula 1 track in Austin and brought a dozen SRT Grand Cherokees for journalists to flog, proving that the massive SUV can handle itself quite well should its owners want to use their truck both for towing a car to the track and racing the tow vehicle itself.\n\nSafety\nThe new Grand Cherokee scored five stars in the side-impact crash test by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but its rollover-resistance rating is three stars for the two-wheel-drive version, which is one star below most SUVs, and four stars in the four-wheel-drive version. A full list of electronic safety aids is standard, including antilock brakes with stability control, hill start assist and trailer-sway control. Full-length side-curtain airbags are standard, as are front-seat-mounted side thorax airbags. The list of optional features is also long: ParkSense detector systems, blind spot warning with rear cross-path detection, forward collision warning with automatic braking and 911 crash detection with the Uconnect system. See all the safety features listed here.\n\nIn the Market\nJeep has not yet found the upper limit for what it can charge for the Grand Cherokee, as customers have been snapping up the loaded Overland trim level at an astonishing rate. For 2014, the Summit trim level has been added above that, which really piles on the luxury trimmings. Four trim levels are available, starting with the Laredo at $29,790, moving up to the Limited at $36,790, then the Overland at $43,990, and topping things off is the new Summit at $48,990 (all prices include a $995 destination charge). A loaded Grand Cherokee Summit is expected to easily top $53,000, and the entry price to get a diesel-equipped model would be a Limited for $41,290. To get in the fire-breathing SRT, however, you must shell out $63,990, but it is unlikely that this lofty sum will put a damper on sales, and Jeep is capping production at just 5,000 units per year. See full Grand Cherokee pricing and trim specifications here.\n\nPricing like this pits the Grand Cherokee against competitors like the Ford Explorer, albeit with a seating deficiency – the Grand Cherokee seats only five to the Explorer’s standard seven. The Grand Cherokee makes up for it in other ways, however, such as off-road prowess, interior comfort, a much easier to use touch-screen and the unique addition of the diesel engine. The rear-wheel-drive layout of the Grand Cherokee would naturally pit it against Toyota’s trucklike 4Runner, but its sales volume and popularity make it more of a match for the Highlander crossover. The Grand Cherokee comes out ahead here as well, with a higher quality interior and more advanced equipment. For roughly the same price as the Highlander Hybrid, the Grand Cherokee Limited EcoDiesel achieves an estimated 2 mpg better highway mileage with a far more powerful engine able to tow more than twice the Highlander Hybrid’s 3,500-pound limit. See how Grand Cherokee stacks up against 2013 model competitors here.\n\nFor many customers, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a second vehicle to complement their much more expensive luxury car, meaning Jeep has to hold its SUV to a higher standard than some of its lesser models in order to maintain its cachet. With this latest 2014 Grand Cherokee, Jeep has successfully done exactly that.\n\n \n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2012 about the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhen I first started driving 20 years ago, I had a few classmates whose parents bought them Jeep Grand Cherokees. That was at the very beginning of this vehicle’s life, and it was quite the status symbol back then. While today’s version is masked by a pretty exterior and upscale finishes, the Grand Cherokee has sadly failed to evolve its ride quality enough to compete with others on the market. It’s lost some of its modern relevance, especially for the families among us.\n\nWhen it comes to driving character, the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee seems to thumb its nose at most of the population, who spend more time on asphalt than they do crossing dry river beds.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee had a total overhaul for 2011, and not much has changed with the 2012 model year. See the two compared side by side here. For the 2012 model year, there are four trim levels available: the Laredo in two- and four-wheel drive, the Limited in two- and four-wheel drive, the Overland in two- and four-wheel drive and the high-performance SRT8 4X4. (See the 4×4 versions side by side.) I tested a Limited 4×4.\n\nIn size and amenities, the Grand Cherokee competes with models like the Volvo XC90, Audi Q7 and VW Touareg. (See them compared.) Its price starts markedly lower, but higher trim levels are priced on par with these premium models. The Jeep and VW have five seats and the other two offer seven in three rows.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Grand Cherokee’s exterior is refined, even upscale-looking, while still sporting definite Jeep characteristics. It has traditional Jeep lines that have been slightly smoothed out to appeal to a more upscale buyer.\n\nThe 20-inch step-in height of the doorsills and lack of running boards were a challenge for my kids climbing in and out of the Grand Cherokee. While they enjoyed the challenge, boasting about their mad indoor rock-climbing skills, I was cursing the car the day I opted to wear a long dress. My husband loved smirking at me as I tried to discreetly hike my dress up high enough I could step up and over the sill and into the car. I was just grateful I didn’t have any work events requiring me to sport a pencil skirt during my weeklong test drive.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThere’s just enough storage throughout the Grand Cherokee’s cabin to function well for families. There are in-door storage bins and bottleholders in all four doors. The kids in the back also have access to seatback storage pockets. When the center rear seat is unoccupied, the seatback folds down to become an armrest with two cupholders in it.\n\nStorage hooks on the back of the front seats were a great spot for my daughters (ages 7, 9 and 12) to hang their kiddie-sized purses. However, grocery bags and adult-size purses hang down far enough that they rest on the floor.\n\nThe backseat passengers had plenty of lateral space and weren’t too cramped even when packed in side by side. Legroom was fine as well, at least with the driver’s seat pulled forward to accommodate my 5-foot, 3-inch stature. My daughter sitting behind the passenger seat — which was pushed back to make room for my tall husband — was a little less lucky, but not uncomfortably so.\n\nBeing that the Grand Cherokee seats a total of five, there’s plenty of space leftover for a large cargo area, 36.3 cubic feet. A power liftgate was standard on my test car, though the button to operate it from the cargo area is located on the cargo doorjamb (rather than on the door itself). This requires you to stand underneath the door to press the button, then duck and weave to get out of its way as it closes. You can also operate it via the keyfob or from the front seat.\n\nWith the rear seats folded flat, the Grand Cherokee’s cargo space expands to 68.3 cubic feet, transforming this SUV into a cargo-hauler capable of stashing huge rolls of pink insulation for my kids’ awesome (and well insulated) tree-house. This is a bit larger than the VW Touareg’s 64.0 cubic feet, but less than the maximum cargo space available when you fold the second and third rows of both the Volvo XC90 (85.1 cubic feet) and Audi Q7 (72.5 cubic feet).\n\nThe $1,495 Luxury Group II option package in my test car offered a few refined features that teased and taunted me, making me want to enjoy driving this car more than I otherwise did. The ventilated front seats worked in an instant to cool my husband and me during the summer heat. Although I didn’t get a chance to test them out, my test car’s heated front seats, heated steering wheel and heated outboard rear seats would have gotten audible cheers from the whole family on chilly fall- and winter-morning treks to school. Even more cheer-worthy was the remote start system, allowing me to start and cool (or heat) the Grand Cherokee before even setting foot in it.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee’s cabin was initially a positive experience, chock-full of premium, even luxurious, features. Driving it, however, was when my initial enthusiasm deflated quicker than a latex helium balloon on a cold day.\n\nThe ride quality and height are adjustable with the optional Quadra-Trac II four-wheel-drive system with which my test car came equipped. You can choose among Sport, Auto, Snow, Sand/Mud and Rock modes, and the car adjusts the drivetrain and air suspension to best fit current conditions. I toggled between Sport and Auto on the dry pavement I drove on for the week. I found the Grand Cherokee to be trucky (which makes sense, given its heavy-duty construction and full off-road capability) and unrefined. It bumped along on the highway almost to the point of vibrating. Not only did I notice this as the driver, but also my kids complained about the backseat being very bumpy. They even demonstrated this by humming the same note and the car’s bumpiness made that note jump and jerk.\n\nAcceleration was quick and responsive, but not smooth, with the optional 360-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 — a $1,695 upgrade over the standard 290-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. It took some practice to get the car to drive along smoothly in the stop-and-go of suburban driving. Despite the V-8’s cylinder-deactivation “fuel-saver technology,” the Grand Cherokee I drove still only gets an EPA-estimated 13/20 mpg city/highway. These numbers bump up as high as 17/23 mpg in the rear-wheel-drive 3.6-liter V-6. Four-wheel drive robs 1 mpg in the city from either engine. These results compare well with the 2012 competition, whose best showing with gas engines are 16/22 mpg in the Q7, 16/23 mpg in the XC90 and 17/23 in the Touareg. The Grand Cherokee SRT8 is a beast all its own, with estimated mileage of 12/18 mpg city/highway.\n\nWind and road noise are both prevalent inside the cabin, adding to driver fatigue and sensory overload after extended highway driving.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee was named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That means it gets the top rating of Good in front, side, rear and rollover tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Grand Cherokee four out of five stars overall (four stars in front impact, five stars in side crash and four stars for rollover resistance in four-wheel-drive versions; two-wheel-drive Grand Cherokees get just three stars in the rollover category).\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Grand Cherokee has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. There are six standard airbags: front- and side-impact bags up front, as well as side curtain airbags that extend from the front to the back row.\n\nA standard backup camera on my test car was much appreciated, as were the standard rear park-assist sensors. The available rear cross detection system saved my test car while pulling out of a parking spot at the grocery store when a vehicle outside my line of vision sped along behind me. The Grand Cherokee “saw” it first and beeped to alert me to stop and wait.\n\nThe seat belt buckles for the backseat’s two outboard seating positions are recessed slightly into the seat bottom. While this creates a cleaner, more streamlined look, they were extremely difficult for my two youngest daughters to buckle from their booster seats. The boosters tended to inch their way sideways just enough to prevent the belt from sliding easily into the buckle. And since the buckles are recessed, kids can’t adjust their angle to buckle up. After much frustration, the two younger ones just resorted to waiting for my 12-year-old to climb into the center seat, push each booster seat toward the door with one hand and then buckle the belt with her other hand.\n\nAnother safety feature I loved was the automatic high-beam headlights. In my neck of the woods, we have deer, bears and porcupines wandering around, so I often drive at night with my brights on. When approaching another vehicle, the brights dimmed on their own without additional intervention from me.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV with five seats in two rows. It’s powered by a 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 or a 375-hp 4xe plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and two electric motors. The PHEV uses a 17.3-kilowatt-hour battery and has an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 26 miles. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Models fitted with the V-6 can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, while the plug-in hybrid comes solely with 4WD.\n\nThe extensive tech and comfort features offered in the Grand Cherokee are impressive, especially in high-end trims like the Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve. True to Jeep tradition, the Grand Cherokee excels at all-terrain adventuring when equipped with options like an adaptive air suspension, off-road camera system, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Rivals include the Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is unchanged for 2025, but Jeep has lowered starting prices across the model lineup.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Alpine audio system\n19-speaker McIntosh audio system\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive air suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDepending on the trim, the Grand Cherokee can be a nicely appointed family runabout or a luxury SUV loaded with features like leather seats, real wood trim and a premium audio system. Keep in mind, though, that the price of the Grand Cherokee just about doubles once you scale the highest reaches of Summit and Summit Reserve trims fitted with the optional PHEV powertrain. If you’re considering a Grand Cherokee but need additional passenger room, the larger Grand Cherokee L has three rows of seats.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A redesign that brings the latest tech and standard advanced safety features is just what the doctor ordered for the aging Grand Cherokee.\n\nVersus the competition: With such a broad range of trim levels, powertrains and prices (even without designated performance models), the Grand Cherokee’s competition ranges from relatively affordable mid-size SUVs to established luxury players — and it goes toe-to-toe with all of them.\n\nThe previous generation of the two-row Jeep Grand Cherokee lasted from the 2011 model year until 2021, but a new-for-2021 three-row Grand Cherokee L heralded the imminent arrival of new styling and updated comfort, convenience and safety tech for the two-row version.\n\nThat’s certainly what we get in the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nRelated: 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Goes High-Tech, Gets Hybrid\n\nI drove a Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve. It’s the most luxurious trim level of the new Grand Cherokee, adding an extra $4,000 worth of opulent options. Total sticker price: $73,085 (including $1,795 destination fee). Unfortunately, we haven’t driven any other versions of the new Grand Cherokee, be they lower trims, the off-roading Trailhawk or the new plug-in hybrid 4xe version.\n\nNew but Familiar\n\nJeep says the new Grand Cherokee has all-new architecture: It’s longer, taller and wider, with a wider track to boot. Non-PHEV powertrains remain the previous 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 and 357-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, but power for both is down a few horsepower versus the previous generation. It’s not particularly noticeable, and the vehicle has shed more than 300 pounds. The Grand Cherokee still feels more substantial on the road compared with some of its mass-market competitors, and the driving experience feels largely unchanged. That, unfortunately, includes some forward visibility problems from my seating position, where both the A-pillars and the rearview mirror interfered with my line of sight.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee isn’t quick with the V-8 under the hood, but it does feel more than adequately powered — and it sounds lovely, with a nice, deep rumble. The eight-speed automatic transmission is responsive and had no problem finding the right gear for a given situation. Handling characteristics are pleasant, if not sporty, thanks to the rear-wheel-drive platform; other competitors use front-wheel-drive architecture and can be prone to understeer, even with optional all-wheel drive. The Grand Cherokee navigates corners pleasantly, if not eagerly. Perhaps eagerness will be reserved for future performance versions to replace last generation’s SRT and Trackhawk trim levels, but none have yet appeared — and federal fuel economy standards and a move toward electrification by Jeep parent company Stellantis may change what those versions look like.\n\nSpeaking of fuel economy, that’s still a weak point in the V-8 Grand Cherokee — even with what Jeep calls aerodynamic improvements in the name of efficiency for the new model. The V-8 is rated 14/22/17 mpg city/highway/combined by the EPA, while the V-6 fares somewhat better with a 19/26/22 mpg rating. Interestingly, that rating applies to both RWD and 4WD versions. (Four-wheel drive is standard on V-8 Grand Cherokees.)\n\nThe Grand Cherokee we tested was equipped with a top-of-the-line Quadra-Lift air suspension, which now features electronic semi-active damping. I’ve always found the ride in air-suspension-equipped Jeeps (and other Stellantis products) to be a bit stiffer overall, but with better isolation from bumps and less body roll in corners than I’ve felt in models with coil-spring suspensions, and that continues here. I would’ve preferred smaller wheels than the 21-inchers on our test vehicle, however, as they created a bit of impact harshness over road imperfections.\n\nThis Is the Height of Luxury\n\nBeing inside the Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve is mostly a delightful experience — as long as you’re sitting up front. High-quality Palermo leather (none of that Capri or Nappa leather you’ll find on the lower trims, no sir) wraps the seats, and there’s real wood and metal everywhere. Maybe too much real metal, in fact: The metal rotary gear selector gets cold in the winter (and, presumably, hot in the summer). The Grand Cherokee also uses a number of faux touch-sensitive controls that are actually piano-black physical buttons with illuminated icons. While almost all of the controls feel high-quality, those faux ones trade some quality feel for the sake of being physical controls — mostly because they’re plastic and other frequently used controls are real metal.\n\nThe massaging front seats were a nice luxurious touch. Another luxury touch in our test vehicle was an optional 10.25-inch front passenger display, which allows the passenger to control the audio, watch videos via Amazon Fire TV for Auto and control the navigation system (and even send navigation to the main center screen). The screen has a privacy filter to keep it from distracting the driver, as well.\n\nThe 19-speaker McIntosh stereo was also a delight to my ears even if its aesthetics don’t quite scream luxury; gothic fonts just aren’t where it’s at. My chief complaint up front, though, is that the centrally located controls are occasionally at odd angles, and the piano-black background can make it difficult to see the button labels.\n\nThe backseat, however, is still not the place to be in the Grand Cherokee. The seat sits very low to the floor, leading to awkward knee positions for occupants. To make up for it, our test vehicle came with an almost $2,000 Rear Seat Video Group I Package that adds displays for rear passengers, also with Amazon Fire TV for Auto.\n\nOverall, the interior of the Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve feels as impressive as anything a more established luxury manufacturer might produce. Are Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz shoppers really going to consider a Jeep? They certainly should.\n\nPositive Tech Updates, But Not an Entirely Positive Experience\n\nTwo more good things happened to the Grand Cherokee with this new generation: It gained Uconnect 5, which is the latest version of the Stellantis brands’ infotainment system, and it got a host of now-standard advanced driver-assist technologies that were optional in the last generation.\n\nUConnect 5 is intuitive, with clear and crisp graphics. For the most part, it was a delight to use on the Summit trim’s larger 10.1-inch touchscreen (an 8.4-inch touchscreen is standard on lower trims). I did encounter some minor instances of lagginess, and at one point I couldn’t get my phone to connect to Apple CarPlay, either wirelessly (wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard) or via a USB cable, but it was an isolated incident.\n\nAs for the safety tech, making features like adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection standard is a big leap forward for Jeep. Previously, features like these were optional on the Grand Cherokee, and only on higher trims.\n\nMore minor driver-assistance features were aggravating, however. I quickly turned off a speed-limit warning that chimed for far too long when the vehicle’s speed exceeded the limit by just a few mph. (You try driving in a city like Chicago and staying under the limit without antagonizing your fellow drivers.) And while warnings for things like school zones and red-light or speed cameras are helpful, the reason for those alerts’ chimes was hidden while using Apple CarPlay. I didn’t turn those warnings off, but I shouldn’t have had to consider it.\n\nRegarding actual safety ratings, neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has yet crash-tested the new Grand Cherokee.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV Priced to Start Around $60K\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 2-Row’s Updates Come at a Cost, But No 4xe Pricing Yet\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2022?\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Brings a Family Pack of Screens, New Appearance Packages\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Vs. 2022 Wagoneer: Which Has the Better Row Setup?\nFor Your Consideration?\n\nGiven its overall improvement without sacrificing its strengths, the new Grand Cherokee is worth a look from luxury shoppers. The factors that made the ultra-luxe version of the Grand Cherokee that I drove better than its predecessor are also present in lower trims, so it’s likely there’s a new Grand Cherokee worth looking at for all sorts of mid-size SUV shoppers.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV with five seats in two rows. It’s powered by a 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 or a 375-hp, “4xe” plug-in hybrid powertrain consisting of a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and two electric motors. The PHEV uses a 17.3-kilowatt-hour battery and has an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 26 miles. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Models fitted with the V-6 can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, while the PHEV comes solely with four-wheel drive. \n\nThe extensive tech and comfort features offered in the Grand Cherokee are impressive, especially in high-end trims like the Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve. True to Jeep tradition, the Grand Cherokee excels at all-terrain adventuring when equipped with options like an adaptive air suspension, an off-road camera system, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Rivals include the Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee was completely redesigned for 2022. As such, the Grand Cherokee sees only minor cosmetic changes for 2024, such as new wheels on a few trim levels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning \n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Alpine audio system\n19-speaker McIntosh audio system\nPanoramic sunroof\nAdaptive air suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDepending on the trim, the Grand Cherokee can be a nicely appointed family runabout or a luxury SUV loaded with features including leather seats, real wood trim and a premium audio system. Keep in mind, though, that the price of the Grand Cherokee just about doubles once you’ve scaled the highest reaches of the Summit and Summit Reserve trims when fitted with the optional plug-in hybrid powertrain. If you’re considering a Grand Cherokee but need additional passenger room, the larger Grand Cherokee L has three rows of seats.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review for the 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT was written in August 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the the two model years, click here.\n\nJeep’s Grand Cherokee has been around a few years in its current form and is due for an update in the not-too-distant future. The current version won our $38,000 Midsize SUV Challenge three years ago and not much has changed since aside from the addition of an EcoDiesel model and a fancy, range-topping Summit model. \n\nI drove the fire-breathing SRT trim, complete with a massive 6.4-liter Hemi V-8, 20-inch black chrome wheels and an electronic sport suspension with a Track mode. There was even a special button on the console labeled “Launch.” It’s about as far from being trail-rated as you can get, making it an awkward idea for the Jeep brand — but we’re not going to complain about brand purity when 475 hp is rumbling out the back through massive quad pipes. \n\nFor 2016, the Grand Cherokee SRT gets a couple of new colors, a lighter aluminum suspension, a new instrument cluster, a revised Performance Pages app and a new set of selectable drive modes. Compare it with the 2015 model here. I took a spin in the new 2016 Grand Cherokee SRT to see if the latest version is as much fun as the first one I drove on the track many years ago.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIt’s hard to make what is essentially an enormous box look sexy. You can’t play much with shapes or sheet metal, but Jeep’s stylists have done a decent job of turning the rugged, sleek, functional Grand Cherokee into a passable approximation of a muscle car. \n\nThe flared fenders, scoops on the bumper, bulges in the hood and dark glossy wheels with thin rubber all suggest this is not a rock-crawling Jeep but something far more sinister. LED running lamps and taillights are standard, as are bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with headlamp washers. Dual exhaust advertises the power under the hood and completes the whole package. If there’s any complaint, it’s that the changes are just a little too subtle: Despite the flared fenders, it looks a lot like other top-trim Grand Cherokees.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDriving the SRT reveals some impressive engineering accomplishments. It’s a beast of a machine, no doubt, but it never feels harsh, unrefined or coarse in its moves. Power comes from a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 pumping out 475 hp, channeled to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. \n\nThe engine growls to life at the push of a button and delivers both an amazing roar and formidable forward momentum at the push of the accelerator, yet it’s not overly loud or intrusive. In fact, I wouldn’t have minded if it had been a little bit louder than it was. Perhaps the upcoming 2017 Trackhawk version, with the supercharged Hellcat V-8, will rectify that situation. \n\nThe throttle can be a bit jumpy, so leaving it in Eco mode around town isn’t a bad idea; it softens power delivery to a more usable level. That means you won’t alarm your passengers when you put your foot into it accelerating from a stoplight at what you had expected would be a gentler pace. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee SRT’s handling is impressive, as well, with excellent feel and a tight turning ratio, but there’s really no disguising this truck’s mass. It feels a bit top-heavy and rolls aplenty in spirited driving, but you can firm everything up thanks to Jeep’s drive modes. Just twist the selector on the center console to the setting that best describes your current activity: Auto, Sport, Track, Snow or Tow. There’s also a Custom mode that allows you to individually tailor the all-wheel-drive system, transmission shifting behavior, paddle shifter operation, stability control intrusion, suspension firmness and steering assist to whatever combination suits your fancy. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee also has an Eco mode button on the center console that softens responses to improve fuel economy. Leaving the Jeep in Auto is a good idea, but popping it into Sport now and then to disable cylinder deactivation (and the odd, dissonant tone it brings to the engine note) and quicken its response can be a lot of fun. Track mode is truly best for the track, as it stiffens the ride to an uncomfortable degree for around-town use.\n\nResting next to the selector knob is a Launch button that has a drag-strip Christmas tree graphic. Pushing it activates the launch control setting, so when you put your left foot on the brake and floor the accelerator with your right, the Jeep will hold in place and rev the engine to a predetermined level. Then just slip your left foot off the brake and off you go, on a maximum acceleration run. Jeep says the Grand Cherokee SRT goes from zero to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, but according to the onboard Performance Pages app that measures acceleration times, I beat that by 0.3 seconds. \n\nHauling all the Grand Cherokee SRT’s 5,104 pounds down to a stop is an easy job for the big Brembo brakes. If you want even more stopping power, opt for the two-piece high-performance brake package. \n\nThe other high-performance SUVs out there are all more powerful than the Grand Cherokee, but they’re also considerably pricier. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 features a powerful twin-turbo, 5.5-liter V-8 pumping out 550 hp, but its power advantage is mitigated slightly by an additional 134 pounds of curb weight. The BMW X5 M is available with an even more powerful 567-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. It’s 156 pounds heavier than the Grand Cherokee, but that’s not likely to be noticed with that much more power on tap. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo can be had with a V-8, as well, and while it offers up 520 hp, it also weighs 287 pounds less than the Grand Cherokee.\n\nWe can talk about fuel economy, I suppose, but in these trucks it’s an afterthought at best. The Grand Cherokee SRT is EPA-rated 13/19/15 mpg city/highway/combined and my week of testing saw the truck return about 15.3 mpg in mixed use. That’s OK, though, as the competition isn’t any better. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 is rated 13/17/15 mpg, while the BMW X5 M is rated 14/19/16 mpg. The lighter Porsche Cayenne Turbo comes in at 14/21/17 mpg — a comparably impressive highway number. All these trucks’ manufacturers recommend premium gasoline.\n\nInterior\n\nWe’ve been fans of the Grand Cherokee’s interior since its last update; we rated its luxurious feel as one of its best features in our 2013 comparison test. \n\nThere’s a good reason for this: According to Jeep, the Grand Cherokee often shares garage space with luxury-brand vehicles, as many shoppers consider it a premium vehicle. The SRT trim amps things up to even more luxurious standards: My test vehicle came with an optional Laguna Leather Package, which uses beautiful premium cowhide on the seats, doors, dash and other surfaces that occupants touch. \n\nThe seats themselves are big, heavily bolstered and very comfortable. They are rather bulky, however, and eat into backseat legroom and knee room a bit. The front seats are heated and ventilated, and the rear outboard seats are heated. Outward visibility is only fair; it’s compromised somewhat by thick A-pillars that can obscure the road ahead when negotiating fast, sweeping corners. Things are plenty airy inside the cabin, though, if you add an optional dual-pane, panoramic moonroof, which lets light into both rows of seats.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe SRT’s new gauge cluster has rearranged things like the tachometer and speedometer, but it’s still one of the most highly configurable gauge clusters in the business. It looks pretty slick. \n\nThere’s also an updated version of Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s Uconnect touch-screen, which works even better than before. It remains one of the easiest multimedia systems to use, with a clean design and quick functionality, and now it’s configurable, as well. Using a drag-and-drop icon tray, you can rearrange it for faster access to things you use more frequently. \n\nThe rest of the buttons and switches inside the Grand Cherokee are high-quality, logically placed and easy to find on the fly. The updated Performance Pages app is also a lot of fun, providing all kinds of timers, supplementary gauges, meters and adjustable controls for people looking to use their SRT for more than just getting groceries.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has never been the biggest midsize SUV, but this latest version scores midpack in terms of cargo room. There’s adequate room in the cargo area: 36.3 cubic feet, expandable to 68.3 cubic feet with the backseat folded. In contrast, the Mercedes-Benz GLE has 38.2/80.3 cubic feet, while the BMW X5 offers up 35.8/76.7 cubic feet. The Porsche Cayenne is a bit smaller, with only 23.7/60.2 cubic feet, due in part to a swoopy roofline over the cargo area.\n\nSafety\n\nThe SRT has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the basic 2016 Grand Cherokee has. It was rated five stars in front- and side-impact testing but only four stars in rollover protection. Its overall rating is five out of five stars. The Grand Cherokee scored a rating of good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s various crash tests, with one exception: It was rated marginal in the small overlap front test. See all its safety test results here. \n\nThe latest Grand Cherokee offers most of the top electronic safety systems you could possibly need. The SRT includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, a backup camera, blind spot and cross-traffic alerts, and front and rear parking sensors — all standard. Surprisingly, there is no lane departure warning or lane departure prevention system offered, though there is a trailer sway control feature as part of the stability control system. See all the Grand Cherokee SRT’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nCompared with competing high-performance SUVs, the Grand Cherokee SRT is a relative bargain. It starts at just $66,690, including destination, and comes fully equipped with just about everything that’s optional in lower-trim Grand Cherokees. You can fancy it up even more by adding the Laguna Leather Package, a rear-seat entertainment system, a trailer tow group, a high-performance Harman Kardon 19-speaker audio system, a dual-pane panoramic moonroof and 20-inch black chrome wheels. My test car had all of them, pushing its sticker price to $76,260.  Tick every option box by adding special paint, a performance brake package, an SRT Night appearance package and more, and you can top out just north of $81,000. \n\nCompetitors are more expensive and only slightly more capable than the SRT. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 (formerly known as the ML63) starts at $100,875. That’s nearly 50 percent more than the Grand Cherokee SRT, but you don’t get much more power or capability for the extra cash. You do get standard lane departure warning in the Mercedes, but the other safety features standard on the SRT — including adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, and cross-traffic alert — are optional on the GLE63. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee SRT also represents a much better performance bargain than the BMW X5 M, which starts at $99,795 and, like the Mercedes, doesn’t include much in the way of standard electronic safety features. \n\nThe Porsche Cayenne, meanwhile, can be had for less than the Grand Cherokee SRT: Its starting price is $59,350, but that’s for a base Cayenne with a 300-hp V-6. A GTS model with a 440-hp, twin-turbo V-6 runs $96,550. To match V-8 versus V-8, you’ll have to spring for the Cayenne Turbo, for $115,750. And at that price, you won’t even get a standard backup camera. Compare the Grand Cherokee SRT with its competition here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV with five seats in two rows. Available powertrains include a standard 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6; a 357-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; and a 375-hp plug-in hybrid consisting of a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and two electric motors known as the 4xe. The plug-in hybrid uses a 17.3 kilowatt-hour battery and has an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 26 miles. All engines are coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Models fitted with the standard V-6 can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, while V-8 and plug-in hybrid versions come solely with four-wheel drive. \n\nThe extensive tech and comfort features offered in the Grand Cherokee are impressive, especially in high-end trims like the Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve. True to Jeep tradition, the Grand Cherokee excels at all-terrain adventuring thanks to options like an adaptive air suspension, an off-road camera system, underbody skid plates, and a limited-slip differential. Rivals include the Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nFollowing a complete redesign for the 2022 model year, changes to the Grand Cherokee for 2023 are minimal. The off-road-ready Trailhawk trim is now offered exclusively with the plug-in hybrid powertrain, and a 10.1-inch infotainment system replaces the previous 8.4-inch unit in Limited and Overland trims.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning system\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Alpine audio system\n19-speaker McIntosh audio system\nPanoramic sunroof\nAdaptive air suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDepending on trim, the Grand Cherokee can be a nicely appointed family runabout or a luxury SUV loaded with features like leather seating, real wood trim and premium audio systems. Keep in mind, though, that the price of the Grand Cherokee just about doubles once you’ve scaled the highest reaches of the Summit and Summit Reserve trims fitted with the optional plug-in hybrid powertrain. In the middle of the range, the punchy V-8 delivers swift acceleration and uncorks this Jeep’s maximum tow rating of 7,200 pounds — though this version has a hefty appetite for fuel. If you’re considering a Grand Cherokee but need additional passenger room, the larger Grand Cherokee L (covered separately in Cars.com’s Research section) has three rows of seats.",

      "expert_review": "The Jeep Grand Cherokee gets only very mild updates for 2017, but it does add an exciting new trim level that raises the level of the mid-size SUV’s off-road capability: the Trailhawk.\n\nA five-seater, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is sold in six trim levels: Laredo, Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and SRT. Compare the 2017 Grand Cherokee with the 2016 model here. \n\nJeep’s goal with the Trailhawk was to make the most off-road-capable mid-size SUV on the market, a title that probably already belonged to one of the model’s other trim levels. The Grand Cherokee’s competition, such as the Nissan Murano, Ford Edge and Kia Sorento, are much more pavement-oriented. Compare the Grand Cherokee with those models here.\n\nIn fact, the 2016 version of the Grand Cherokee recently took on these three SUVs (as well as the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport) in our 2016 Midsize SUV Challenge at the end of last year. And it finished… dead last. One of the reasons was its more truck-like ride, but that isn’t something I mind in an SUV — especially if it comes with added capability. And the Trailhawk takes that concept even further, adding a slew of mechanical upgrades that make it an off-road savant — plus rugged styling touches to match.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n$$IMAGE-1,3,4,5,6,7$$\n\nThe Grand Cherokee stands out from the rest of its class with its old-school, rugged styling, and the Trailhawk takes that motif further still with a few unique styling touches. Each Trailhawk features flat-black appliques on the hood, plus front and rear tow hooks that are painted bright red. There are also gray side mirrors and roof-rack accents.\n\nTo protect its underbody, the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk has standard skid plates front and rear. Mopar rock rails are optional if you require rocker panel protection. The front air dam is removable for added clearance when traversing obstacles.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n$$IMAGE-8,9,10,11$$\n\nUnder the hood, the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk I tested came with the standard Jeep Grand Cherokee engine: a 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 260 pounds-feet of torque. A 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 that makes 390 pounds-feet of torque is available, as well. Jeep says that a 240-hp, 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 that makes 420 pounds-feet of torque will be an option on Trailhawk and Summit models, but it wasn’t available as of publication; according to the EPA, it violates the Clean Air Act and has not been certified for use in 2017 models (though the latest word is that it will be). An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission option.\n\nJeep outfitted the Trailhawk with Quadra-Drive II full-time all-wheel drive with an electronic limited-slip rear differential and an adjustable air suspension that’s unique in this price range. It takes the Grand Cherokee to another level of off-road prowess, raising the Trailhawk as needed for added ground clearance and greater suspension travel. The all-wheel drive also includes an advanced traction control system called Quadra-Trac II, which can anticipate wheel slippage and send more torque to the wheels with traction. It also adds a Low range suitable for slower crawling. \n\nA control panel behind the shift lever gives the driver full control over off-road settings, including hill ascent and descent control, raising and lowering the air suspension, Low range and a knob for the Selec-Terrain traction control system, which has five settings for types of terrain (Snow, Sand, Auto, Mud and Rock).\n\nThese changes all pay huge dividends off-road, where the Trailhawk truly shines, especially with its smart traction control system. There was a point where the Trailhawk was up on three wheels, and the system immediately halted power to the wheel that was up in the air and directed it to the other wheels, helping pull the Trailhawk over the obstacle.\n\nWe took the Trailhawk out with a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon on the same trails and obstacles. Though it wasn’t as naturally suited to the exercises as the Wrangler was, the Trailhawk made it through everything with its combination of ground clearance, excellent traction control, all-wheel drive and plenty of power from the V-6, delivered in a linear fashion that was easy to control.\n\nThere are tradeoffs to the Trailhawk’s emphasis on capability, however. The unique suspension is great off-road but offers a worse ride on pavement. The suspension, with its extra travel and softer tuning, didn’t really feel settled on the highway — much less so than other Grand Cherokee trims I’ve driven. It was prone to rebounding on road imperfections, which gave the ride an undulating quality.\n\nFuel economy figures vary by engine choice. Our Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk with the V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined on regular gas, while the V-8 is rated 14/22/17 mpg on mid-grade fuel. The potential EcoDiesel engine had been the mileage champ, rating as high as 30 mpg in the city with rear-wheel drive; that would make it as attractive as its high torque rating should it be cleared for sale.\n\nInterior\n\n$$IMAGE-12,13$$\n\nOther than some Trailhawk badging on the seats and steering wheel, the interior is what you’ll find in most other Grand Cherokee trims — good materials and plenty of room, front and rear.  \nAnd even though there’s a beefy all-wheel-drive system, there isn’t a floor hump, so three passengers can fit more comfortably across the rear seat and won’t be forced into playing footsie. \nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n$$IMAGE-14$$\n\nThough Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren’t offered, their absence is mitigated by Uconnect, which is a solid multimedia system in its own right. The system hasn’t changed much throughout the years and remains one of my favorites to use, with intuitive operation. The optional, larger 8.4-inch screen in our test vehicle was easily visible and reachable from both front seats. The standard screen is 5 inches.\n\nOne part of the Grand Cherokee’s interior design that I really appreciated was the back of the center console, which houses not only vents for air circulation but also a pair of easily accessible USB charge ports and a 110-volt household outlet. This provides plenty of charging options for backseat passengers, and the outlet means a larger mobile device or laptop can be charged while on the go, as well.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Grand Cherokee Trailhawk has 36.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its 60/40-split folding backseat, which expands to 68.3 cubic feet when the seats are dropped. That places the Grand Cherokee in the middle of the pack compared with other members of this class, ahead of the Murano (32.1/67.0 cubic feet) but trailing the Edge (39.2/73.4 cubic feet).\n\nWith standard towing capacity of 6,200 pounds (up to 7,200 or 7,400 pounds with the other engines, depending on driveline), the Trailhawk obliterates the Murano, Edge, Sorento and Explorer, which can tow only 1,500 or 2,000 pounds in their standard forms.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Grand Cherokee received a score of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in each of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s tests except the small overlap front test, where it’s rated marginal. This makes it one of the lower performers in the Institute’s mid-size SUVs class.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee includes a standard backup camera. The Trailhawk I drove also came with the Active Safety Group option package ($1,495) that adds adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking that operates at all speeds; lane departure warning; and parallel/perpendicular park assist that will steer the Grand Cherokee into a parking space while the driver controls the gas and brake. It also came with optional blind spot warning ($595).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n$$IMAGE-15,16$$\n\nThe Trailhawk has a base price of $44,990 including destination charge and comes standard with many convenience features in addition to the mechanical upgrades mentioned previously: heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, an 8.4-inch touchscreen display with Uconnect, 18-inch off-road wheels, a heated steering wheel and power front seats.\n\nOur test vehicle came with several option packages not already mentioned, including the Trailhawk Luxury Group (automatic high beams, panoramic moonroof, LED daytime running lights and a power-adjustable steering column, among other options) for $2,695. Rock rails ($900) and navigation ($450) gave it a final price of $50,125 as tested.\n\nConsidering that the price cap for our 2016 Midsize SUV Challenge was $45,000, the Trailhawk would be in the higher echelon of that class. But then again, it’s much more capable, and for a consumer who puts a priority on off-road capability, the Trailhawk is a welcome addition to the field.\n\nIt may be more apt to compare the Trailhawk to two other SUVs with more of that focus — the Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock (which starts at $43,240 but was $48,120 in the configuration we tested against the Trailhawk) and the Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro, which starts at $43,340. Neither offers the same towing capacity as the Grand Cherokee, with the Wrangler Unlimited towing just 3,500 pounds and the 4Runner 5,000 pounds.\n\nIt should be noted that the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk is much better on pavement than these two, plus it offers extra creature comforts and safety features that justify its price premium.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If you think that the Grand Cherokee SRT with its 475-horsepower, 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 is bonkers in all the right ways, then the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk will have you in stitches. It stretches the concept of a performance SUV to its absolute maximum and will go on sale late in 2017.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe name Trackhawk might sound familiar — Jeep released an off-road-oriented version of the Grand Cherokee last year called the Trailhawk. That one was designed to go further off-road than any other Grand Cherokee before it. This one is designed to go faster on the road (or the track).\n\nExterior\nThe front of the Trackhawk features Jeep’s signature seven-slot grille and has extensive modifications to feed air to the thirsty engine and cooling systems, such as removing the foglights to optimize airflow. On the sculpted hood are dual heat extractors that both look cool and aid with cooling.\n \nOther unique styling touches beyond the hood include side sill cladding, body-colored wheel flares and a gloss-black rear valence that houses the black chrome exhaust tips.\n \nTwenty-inch wheels are standard, with a satin chrome center cap; optional low-gloss black alloy wheels are 12 pounds lighter. The Trackhawk also gets all-new rubber: Pirelli 295/45ZR20 Scorpion Verde tires are standard, with Pirelli P Zero three-season tires (with an increased speed rating to match) also available.\n \nInterior\nThe cabin is accented in carbon fiber and metal, while the seats are wrapped in standard Nappa leather and suede. Also available is a Signature Leather Interior Package, seen in these photos, with an embossed “Trackhawk” logo on the front seats.\n \nThe Trackhawk’s in-cabin technology is geared toward performance as well. The instrument panel has a center mounted tachometer, flanked by the speedometer on the left, which reaches all the way up to 200 mph.\n \nIn the center console is an 8.4-inch touchscreen that has been customized to add Trackhawk-exclusive Performance Pages, which can display information like real-time engine output, four-wheel-drive configuration, a gear reader and various track timers (zero-to-60 mph, zero-to-100 mph and braking distance). The pages also allow the driver to activate launch control and setup custom drive modes.\n \nUnder the Hood\nThe Trackhawk features the same engine found in the Dodge Challenger and Charger SRT Hellcats, a 707-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 645 pounds-feet of torque. The supercharger provides up to 11.6 psi of boost and spins at a maximum speed of 14,600 rpm. An eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters is standard, as is 4WD. The 4WD system features a single-speed active transfer case and an electronic limited-slip rear differential, along with a stronger rear axle to handle all that power.\n \nThe numbers from Jeep are jaw-dropping: zero-to-60 mph in 3.5 seconds, quarter-mile sprint in 11.6 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph. Then you remember that this is also a 5,000-plus-pound mid-size SUV, and all of those college physics courses make even less sense. To help hit these numbers, launch control is standard, along with a Torque Reserve system that provides a quicker initial response to boost acceleration even more.\n \nThere are five selectable drive modes, each offering unique transmission, 4WD torque split, steering and adaptive shock absorber settings: Auto, Sport, Track, Tow and Snow.\n \nSafety\nThe list of standard safety technology is long, with adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection, autonomous forward emergency braking at all speeds, front and rear parking sensors, and a trailer hitch camera view, which lets the driver check on a trailer through the backup camera while traveling at speed.\n \nThere is also a (necessary) Valet mode, which locks out first gear and significantly reduces power and torque. It won’t allow manual shifting through the shifter or the paddle shifters, and it disables launch control while leaving the stability control in “Full-on” mode. This mode can be turned on and off using a four-digit PIN.",

Where it lags is in areas that are more important to most buyers, such as interior refinement, fuel economy and standard safety tech.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Mid-Size SUV of 2019?\n\nFew vehicles give shoppers such diverse choices as the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The flagship SUV’s seven available trim levels include stylish premium offerings, a capable four-wheel-drive off-roader, two high-performance variants and a few more affordable all-around SUVs.\n\nWe tested a Grand Cherokee Limited X, which is a mid-level version of the SUV. The Limited X takes a regular Limited and adds a performance appearance package, giving it the look of its much faster — and much more expensive — siblings. (Sort of like when owners of the Dodge Challenger, a Grand Cherokee platform-mate, add Hellcat badging to their V-6 cars — and it’s always a V-6.)\n\nHow does an SUV that hasn’t seen much more than aesthetic tweaks keep up with the changing times, especially in a crowded field that features a number of new (old) names like the Honda Passport and Chevrolet Blazer? Compare them here, and read on for the answer.\n\nThe Good\n\nLet’s start with the good news. The Grand Cherokee has been Jeep’s flagship SUV for decades, and it still mostly looks and feels the part. It’s aesthetically pleasing and has a feeling of solidity, backed up by ride quality that’s rarely — if ever — flustered by bumps or road imperfections. Some of that feeling is due to a suspension that, in non-performance models, is focused on giving the driver the opportunity to go off-road with confidence. An optional four-corner air suspension adds up to 4.1 inches of lift at the touch of a button for when the going gets extra-tough.\n\nThat’s backed up on most versions by three available four-wheel-drive systems (SRT and Trackhawk models get a fourth, entirely different 4×4 system that’s more track- than trail-focused). The base 4×4 system is the basic full-time Quadra-Trac I system, found on the base Laredo. Next is Quadra-Trac II, which adds a two-speed transfer case and hill descent control, then another version of Quadra-Drive II that adds an electronic limited-slip rear differential.\n\nThe parts bin at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has done wonders for the Grand Cherokee’s powertrain. Standard equipment for most models is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that’s good for 295 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The numbers don’t blow you away, but in our test vehicle, the engine provided solid, linear power when paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. There wasn’t any noticeable hesitation during passing maneuvers or lag from a standing start. An available 5.7-liter V-8 boasts 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet, and a 6.4-liter V-8 with 475 hp and 470 pounds-feet is standard in the SRT performance model. If you want an absolutely nutty SUV, opt for a Trackhawk and its Hellcat-derived 6.2-liter supercharged V-8, which is good for 707 hp. All are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions tuned for their respective engines.\n\nThe parts bin also contributes to a familiar and well thought-out interior, with a user-friendly control layout for everything from the four-wheel-drive system to the climate controls. There’s also a Uconnect multimedia system with a 7-inch touchscreen standard on the Laredo (every other trim level gets an 8.4-inch touchscreen). Uconnect has long been one of my favorite multimedia systems for its graphics quality and ease of use, and that hasn’t changed with the current generation. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with either display.\n\nWe didn’t test the Grand Cherokee’s towing prowess, but its maximum towing capacity — 6,200-7,200 pounds, powertrain depending — is significantly higher than most vehicles in its class.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNow for the bad news: The Grand Cherokee was the lowest-scoring model in our recent 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge, for which I was a judge. The Grand Cherokee tied for last in fuel-economy and noise rankings, and it was next to last in the cargo test and our judges’ value ranking. In eight other categories, the Grand Cherokee was average or below average. We called it “death by a thousand cuts” when discussing its finish.\n\nFuel economy is an issue. The EPA rates the V-6 Grand Cherokee at 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive (rear-wheel-drive models get the same combined rating but a 1-mpg boost in city and highway numbers). Our mileage test came in slightly higher than its combined rating at 22.2 mpg, but still near the bottom of our field of six. The V-6 model is also the only Grand Cherokee that Jeep recommends running on regular 87-octane gasoline. The 5.7-liter V-8 can run on regular, but Jeep recommends mid-grade 89-octane gas, and the SRT and Trackhawk require premium juice. The 2019 Nissan Murano was our mileage test champion, and it has an EPA rating of 20/28/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. The overall winner of our test was the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, which has similar EPA ratings to the Grand Cherokee at 19/24/21 mpg but finished our testing with an average of 25.1 mpg.\n\nNoise is also a problem with the Grand Cherokee, though not from outside factors. All three of our judges noticed a low-frequency hum while driving that can be extremely grating; it caused me more than one headache. Fortunately, other noises don’t intrude at levels noticeably greater than in the Grand Cherokee’s competitors.\n\nGrand Cherokee interiors are also something of a mixed bag. Along with the praiseworthy control layout and multimedia system, the leather in our test vehicle felt nice. But the dashboard looks like a sheet of black plastic, the backseat doesn’t recline or slide, making it feel extra cramped (the hard front seatbacks don’t help), and there are no cargo-area releases to fold the backseat (like all five of the Jeep’s competitors in our Challenge had).\n\nLastly, driving dynamics pay the price for the off-road capabilities of most Grand Cherokee models. Whatever handling benefits are gained by the rear-wheel-drive nature of the Grand Cherokee’s platform — most competitors have front-wheel-drive platforms — are negated by the significant body roll our Grand Cherokee exhibited in spirited driving; it felt like a Toyota 4Runner with slightly better manners. For better or worse, there’s an inescapably trucklike feel to the Grand Cherokee, at least without the optional air suspension.\n\nSafety Ratings and Features\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is rated five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated it marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the driver’s-side small overlap front crash test. Most of the Jeep’s IIHS class rivals earned a rating of good in this test. (The Grand Cherokee has not yet been subjected to the passenger-side test.)\n\nIn our own Car Seat Check of the Grand Cherokee, we praised its ability to fit three child-safety seats side by side in the backseat, but it managed no more than a B grade in any of our seat-specific tests.\n\nSome advanced safety features — forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning, but not things like lane-centering steering or 360-degree camera systems that others in the class offer — are available on all but the lowest Laredo trim for 2019 (all 2020 models can be equipped with these features regardless of trim), but the key word here is “available.” As competitors move to make advanced safety tech standard, Jeep continues to charge shoppers more for it.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room\n\nValue is where the Grand Cherokee struggles, especially with its ostensible competitors sometimes costing thousands — if not tens of thousands — less. Our Grand Cherokee stickered for more than $52,000 but came in last in our Challenge (won by a Hyundai Santa Fe that didn’t even total $40,000). The Grand Cherokee may start out around $30,000, but to get a “nice” trim that competes with premium offerings from, say, Lexus, shoppers might have to spend $55,000 to $60,000 or more. Meanwhile, the SRT is nearly $70,000 and a Trackhawk will run you close to $90,000 — before options.\n\nWeirdly, the two most expensive Grand Cherokees are also likely the best value propositions, as similar performance from an SUV usually involves letters like AMG (from Mercedes-Benz) or M (from BMW), along with exorbitant six-figure prices. It’s the mid-level and luxury trims of the Grand Cherokee that will most benefit from a full redesign to make them more competitive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a solid, stylish SUV that’s starting to show its age — no surprise, given the current generation has been around since 2011, with only a cosmetic refresh in 2014.\n\nVersus the competition: The Grand Cherokee offers a heavy-duty four-wheel-drive system — a rarity for mid-size SUVs — and significantly higher maximum towing capacity than most of its competition. Where it lags is in areas that are more important to most buyers, such as interior refinement, fuel economy and standard safety tech.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Mid-Size SUV of 2019?\n\nFew vehicles give shoppers such diverse choices as the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The flagship SUV’s seven available trim levels include stylish premium offerings, a capable four-wheel-drive off-roader, two high-performance variants and a few more affordable all-around SUVs.\n\nWe tested a Grand Cherokee Limited X, which is a mid-level version of the SUV. The Limited X takes a regular Limited and adds a performance appearance package, giving it the look of its much faster — and much more expensive — siblings. (Sort of like when owners of the Dodge Challenger, a Grand Cherokee platform-mate, add Hellcat badging to their V-6 cars — and it’s always a V-6.)\n\nHow does an SUV that hasn’t seen much more than aesthetic tweaks keep up with the changing times, especially in a crowded field that features a number of new (old) names like the Honda Passport and Chevrolet Blazer? Compare them here, and read on for the answer.\n\nThe Good\n\nLet’s start with the good news. The Grand Cherokee has been Jeep’s flagship SUV for decades, and it still mostly looks and feels the part. It’s aesthetically pleasing and has a feeling of solidity, backed up by ride quality that’s rarely — if ever — flustered by bumps or road imperfections. Some of that feeling is due to a suspension that, in non-performance models, is focused on giving the driver the opportunity to go off-road with confidence. An optional four-corner air suspension adds up to 4.1 inches of lift at the touch of a button for when the going gets extra-tough.\n\nThat’s backed up on most versions by three available four-wheel-drive systems (SRT and Trackhawk models get a fourth, entirely different 4×4 system that’s more track- than trail-focused). The base 4×4 system is the basic full-time Quadra-Trac I system, found on the base Laredo. Next is Quadra-Trac II, which adds a two-speed transfer case and hill descent control, then another version of Quadra-Drive II that adds an electronic limited-slip rear differential.\n\nThe parts bin at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has done wonders for the Grand Cherokee’s powertrain. Standard equipment for most models is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that’s good for 295 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The numbers don’t blow you away, but in our test vehicle, the engine provided solid, linear power when paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. There wasn’t any noticeable hesitation during passing maneuvers or lag from a standing start. An available 5.7-liter V-8 boasts 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet, and a 6.4-liter V-8 with 475 hp and 470 pounds-feet is standard in the SRT performance model. If you want an absolutely nutty SUV, opt for a Trackhawk and its Hellcat-derived 6.2-liter supercharged V-8, which is good for 707 hp. All are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions tuned for their respective engines.\n\nThe parts bin also contributes to a familiar and well thought-out interior, with a user-friendly control layout for everything from the four-wheel-drive system to the climate controls. There’s also a Uconnect multimedia system with a 7-inch touchscreen standard on the Laredo (every other trim level gets an 8.4-inch touchscreen). Uconnect has long been one of my favorite multimedia systems for its graphics quality and ease of use, and that hasn’t changed with the current generation. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with either display.\n\nWe didn’t test the Grand Cherokee’s towing prowess, but its maximum towing capacity — 6,200-7,200 pounds, powertrain depending — is significantly higher than most vehicles in its class.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNow for the bad news: The Grand Cherokee was the lowest-scoring model in our recent 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge, for which I was a judge. The Grand Cherokee tied for last in fuel-economy and noise rankings, and it was next to last in the cargo test and our judges’ value ranking. In eight other categories, the Grand Cherokee was average or below average. We called it “death by a thousand cuts” when discussing its finish.\n\nFuel economy is an issue. The EPA rates the V-6 Grand Cherokee at 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive (rear-wheel-drive models get the same combined rating but a 1-mpg boost in city and highway numbers). Our mileage test came in slightly higher than its combined rating at 22.2 mpg, but still near the bottom of our field of six. The V-6 model is also the only Grand Cherokee that Jeep recommends running on regular 87-octane gasoline. The 5.7-liter V-8 can run on regular, but Jeep recommends mid-grade 89-octane gas, and the SRT and Trackhawk require premium juice. The 2019 Nissan Murano was our mileage test champion, and it has an EPA rating of 20/28/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. The overall winner of our test was the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, which has similar EPA ratings to the Grand Cherokee at 19/24/21 mpg but finished our testing with an average of 25.1 mpg.\n\nNoise is also a problem with the Grand Cherokee, though not from outside factors. All three of our judges noticed a low-frequency hum while driving that can be extremely grating; it caused me more than one headache. Fortunately, other noises don’t intrude at levels noticeably greater than in the Grand Cherokee’s competitors.\n\nGrand Cherokee interiors are also something of a mixed bag. Along with the praiseworthy control layout and multimedia system, the leather in our test vehicle felt nice. But the dashboard looks like a sheet of black plastic, the backseat doesn’t recline or slide, making it feel extra cramped (the hard front seatbacks don’t help), and there are no cargo-area releases to fold the backseat (like all five of the Jeep’s competitors in our Challenge had).\n\nLastly, driving dynamics pay the price for the off-road capabilities of most Grand Cherokee models. Whatever handling benefits are gained by the rear-wheel-drive nature of the Grand Cherokee’s platform — most competitors have front-wheel-drive platforms — are negated by the significant body roll our Grand Cherokee exhibited in spirited driving; it felt like a Toyota 4Runner with slightly better manners. For better or worse, there’s an inescapably trucklike feel to the Grand Cherokee, at least without the optional air suspension.\n\nSafety Ratings and Features\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is rated five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated it marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the driver’s-side small overlap front crash test. Most of the Jeep’s IIHS class rivals earned a rating of good in this test. (The Grand Cherokee has not yet been subjected to the passenger-side test.)\n\nIn our own Car Seat Check of the Grand Cherokee, we praised its ability to fit three child-safety seats side by side in the backseat, but it managed no more than a B grade in any of our seat-specific tests.\n\nSome advanced safety features — forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning, but not things like lane-centering steering or 360-degree camera systems that others in the class offer — are available on all but the lowest Laredo trim for 2019 (all 2020 models can be equipped with these features regardless of trim), but the key word here is “available.” As competitors move to make advanced safety tech standard, Jeep continues to charge shoppers more for it.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room\n\nValue is where the Grand Cherokee struggles, especially with its ostensible competitors sometimes costing thousands — if not tens of thousands — less. Our Grand Cherokee stickered for more than $52,000 but came in last in our Challenge (won by a Hyundai Santa Fe that didn’t even total $40,000). The Grand Cherokee may start out around $30,000, but to get a “nice” trim that competes with premium offerings from, say, Lexus, shoppers might have to spend $55,000 to $60,000 or more. Meanwhile, the SRT is nearly $70,000 and a Trackhawk will run you close to $90,000 — before options.\n\nWeirdly, the two most expensive Grand Cherokees are also likely the best value propositions, as similar performance from an SUV usually involves letters like AMG (from Mercedes-Benz) or M (from BMW), along with exorbitant six-figure prices. It’s the mid-level and luxury trims of the Grand Cherokee that will most benefit from a full redesign to make them more competitive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a solid, stylish SUV that’s starting to show its age — no surprise, given the current generation has been around since 2011, with only a cosmetic refresh in 2014.\n\nVersus the competition: The Grand Cherokee offers a heavy-duty four-wheel-drive system — a rarity for mid-size SUVs — and significantly higher maximum towing capacity than most of its competition. Where it lags is in areas that are more important to most buyers, such as interior refinement, fuel economy and standard safety tech.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Mid-Size SUV of 2019?\n\nFew vehicles give shoppers such diverse choices as the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The flagship SUV’s seven available trim levels include stylish premium offerings, a capable four-wheel-drive off-roader, two high-performance variants and a few more affordable all-around SUVs.\n\nWe tested a Grand Cherokee Limited X, which is a mid-level version of the SUV. The Limited X takes a regular Limited and adds a performance appearance package, giving it the look of its much faster — and much more expensive — siblings. (Sort of like when owners of the Dodge Challenger, a Grand Cherokee platform-mate, add Hellcat badging to their V-6 cars — and it’s always a V-6.)\n\nHow does an SUV that hasn’t seen much more than aesthetic tweaks keep up with the changing times, especially in a crowded field that features a number of new (old) names like the Honda Passport and Chevrolet Blazer? Compare them here, and read on for the answer.\n\nThe Good\n\nLet’s start with the good news. The Grand Cherokee has been Jeep’s flagship SUV for decades, and it still mostly looks and feels the part. It’s aesthetically pleasing and has a feeling of solidity, backed up by ride quality that’s rarely — if ever — flustered by bumps or road imperfections. Some of that feeling is due to a suspension that, in non-performance models, is focused on giving the driver the opportunity to go off-road with confidence. An optional four-corner air suspension adds up to 4.1 inches of lift at the touch of a button for when the going gets extra-tough.\n\nThat’s backed up on most versions by three available four-wheel-drive systems (SRT and Trackhawk models get a fourth, entirely different 4×4 system that’s more track- than trail-focused). The base 4×4 system is the basic full-time Quadra-Trac I system, found on the base Laredo. Next is Quadra-Trac II, which adds a two-speed transfer case and hill descent control, then another version of Quadra-Drive II that adds an electronic limited-slip rear differential.\n\nThe parts bin at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has done wonders for the Grand Cherokee’s powertrain. Standard equipment for most models is a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that’s good for 295 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The numbers don’t blow you away, but in our test vehicle, the engine provided solid, linear power when paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. There wasn’t any noticeable hesitation during passing maneuvers or lag from a standing start. An available 5.7-liter V-8 boasts 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet, and a 6.4-liter V-8 with 475 hp and 470 pounds-feet is standard in the SRT performance model. If you want an absolutely nutty SUV, opt for a Trackhawk and its Hellcat-derived 6.2-liter supercharged V-8, which is good for 707 hp. All are mated to eight-speed automatic transmissions tuned for their respective engines.\n\nThe parts bin also contributes to a familiar and well thought-out interior, with a user-friendly control layout for everything from the four-wheel-drive system to the climate controls. There’s also a Uconnect multimedia system with a 7-inch touchscreen standard on the Laredo (every other trim level gets an 8.4-inch touchscreen). Uconnect has long been one of my favorite multimedia systems for its graphics quality and ease of use, and that hasn’t changed with the current generation. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with either display.\n\nWe didn’t test the Grand Cherokee’s towing prowess, but its maximum towing capacity — 6,200-7,200 pounds, powertrain depending — is significantly higher than most vehicles in its class.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNow for the bad news: The Grand Cherokee was the lowest-scoring model in our recent 2019 Mid-Size SUV Challenge, for which I was a judge. The Grand Cherokee tied for last in fuel-economy and noise rankings, and it was next to last in the cargo test and our judges’ value ranking. In eight other categories, the Grand Cherokee was average or below average. We called it “death by a thousand cuts” when discussing its finish.\n\nFuel economy is an issue. The EPA rates the V-6 Grand Cherokee at 18/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive (rear-wheel-drive models get the same combined rating but a 1-mpg boost in city and highway numbers). Our mileage test came in slightly higher than its combined rating at 22.2 mpg, but still near the bottom of our field of six. The V-6 model is also the only Grand Cherokee that Jeep recommends running on regular 87-octane gasoline. The 5.7-liter V-8 can run on regular, but Jeep recommends mid-grade 89-octane gas, and the SRT and Trackhawk require premium juice. The 2019 Nissan Murano was our mileage test champion, and it has an EPA rating of 20/28/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. The overall winner of our test was the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe, which has similar EPA ratings to the Grand Cherokee at 19/24/21 mpg but finished our testing with an average of 25.1 mpg.\n\nNoise is also a problem with the Grand Cherokee, though not from outside factors. All three of our judges noticed a low-frequency hum while driving that can be extremely grating; it caused me more than one headache. Fortunately, other noises don’t intrude at levels noticeably greater than in the Grand Cherokee’s competitors.\n\nGrand Cherokee interiors are also something of a mixed bag. Along with the praiseworthy control layout and multimedia system, the leather in our test vehicle felt nice. But the dashboard looks like a sheet of black plastic, the backseat doesn’t recline or slide, making it feel extra cramped (the hard front seatbacks don’t help), and there are no cargo-area releases to fold the backseat (like all five of the Jeep’s competitors in our Challenge had).\n\nLastly, driving dynamics pay the price for the off-road capabilities of most Grand Cherokee models. Whatever handling benefits are gained by the rear-wheel-drive nature of the Grand Cherokee’s platform — most competitors have front-wheel-drive platforms — are negated by the significant body roll our Grand Cherokee exhibited in spirited driving; it felt like a Toyota 4Runner with slightly better manners. For better or worse, there’s an inescapably trucklike feel to the Grand Cherokee, at least without the optional air suspension.\n\nSafety Ratings and Features\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is rated five stars overall by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated it marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the driver’s-side small overlap front crash test. Most of the Jeep’s IIHS class rivals earned a rating of good in this test. (The Grand Cherokee has not yet been subjected to the passenger-side test.)\n\nIn our own Car Seat Check of the Grand Cherokee, we praised its ability to fit three child-safety seats side by side in the backseat, but it managed no more than a B grade in any of our seat-specific tests.\n\nSome advanced safety features — forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning, but not things like lane-centering steering or 360-degree camera systems that others in the class offer — are available on all but the lowest Laredo trim for 2019 (all 2020 models can be equipped with these features regardless of trim), but the key word here is “available.” As competitors move to make advanced safety tech standard, Jeep continues to charge shoppers more for it.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room\n\nValue is where the Grand Cherokee struggles, especially with its ostensible competitors sometimes costing thousands — if not tens of thousands — less. Our Grand Cherokee stickered for more than $52,000 but came in last in our Challenge (won by a Hyundai Santa Fe that didn’t even total $40,000). The Grand Cherokee may start out around $30,000, but to get a “nice” trim that competes with premium offerings from, say, Lexus, shoppers might have to spend $55,000 to $60,000 or more. Meanwhile, the SRT is nearly $70,000 and a Trackhawk will run you close to $90,000 — before options.\n\nWeirdly, the two most expensive Grand Cherokees are also likely the best value propositions, as similar performance from an SUV usually involves letters like AMG (from Mercedes-Benz) or M (from BMW), along with exorbitant six-figure prices. It’s the mid-level and luxury trims of the Grand Cherokee that will most benefit from a full redesign to make them more competitive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
