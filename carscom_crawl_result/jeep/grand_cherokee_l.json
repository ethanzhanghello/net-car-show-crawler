      "expert_review": "Updating an icon is a tricky job for any automaker, and it’s especially challenging when your brand has more than one icon. But Jeep’s been in that situation before, and it’s always a momentous occasion when the Grand Cherokee SUV gets an update, and that day is upon us. This is the new 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L, something new from the Jeep brand — a Grand Cherokee with seating for six or seven. It’s not Jeep’s first three-row SUV (that would be the unloved, unlamented Commander from a decade ago), but it is the first three-row version of the Grand Cherokee (a two-row, five-seat model will be following soon). \n\nRelated: 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L: Three Rows and Grand, but Not the Wagoneer\n\nJeep expects the explosion of big, three-row SUVs to drive a lot of people into the Jeep showroom when this new model arrives this summer, and invited us to the company’s Chelsea, Mich., proving grounds to drive the new Grand Cherokee L through the rural countryside and over some tough off-road obstacles to prove that despite its newfound family orientation, this all-new Grand Cherokee is still, at heart, a Trail Rated Jeep.  \n\nSmart, Evolutionary Styling\n\nThere are a few distinctive elements that make any Jeep a Jeep, and those elements are maintained on the new Grand Cherokee L. The seven-slot grille will always be there, as will the squared-off wheel arches. But there are new elements that are fresh for 2021, like the big, upright front end with standard LED headlights and active grille shutters for improved aerodynamics (and fuel economy). There’s also a “floating” roof look with a neat piece of brightwork trim that starts at the tips of the side mirrors and extends up and over the side windows and down around the liftgate glass in one seamless, flowing arc. It gives some models the option of having a contrasting two-tone black roof, which looks pretty fantastic on a light-colored vehicle (but even Jeep’s designers wondered out loud if it might be “the next [generation] vinyl roof” styling affectation).\n\nI think it looks fantastic, and the extra length of this extended-wheelbase Grand Cherokee L model to accommodate a third row doesn’t seem out of place, unusual or ill-proportioned at all. The rear-wheel-drive platform that underpins the Grand Cherokee L is longer, taller and slightly wider than the Grand Cherokee, and the emphasis on horizontal lines definitely gives it a wider look and feel. From the short front overhang to the well-proportioned, upswept lines in the rear (also a nod to the SUV’s improved aerodynamics), this new Grand Cherokee L is instantly identifiable as a Jeep SUV but also doesn’t feel retro or staid in the slightest. Opt for the top-of-the-line Summit trim with the Summit Reserve Package and you can spec 21-inch wheels that look tremendous. So Jeep most definitely didn’t ruin the way the new Grand Cherokee looks. \n\nPremium Feel, On-Road and Off\n\nJeep says that the new Grand Cherokee L sits on an entirely new platform, one created specifically for the model (it’s not a modified version of an Italian Fiat platform, as was originally considered). That means Jeep engineers could tune the new chassis and suspension specifically for duty as a Grand Cherokee, albeit one that is intentionally aimed at more family duty than overlanding duty. Jeep believes that this three-row version is going to be popular with families, but as my drive in the thing proved, it still wears many hats quite well: luxury SUV, highly capable rock crawler, excellent highway road-trip companion, even a decent towing rig.\n\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n\nGrand Cherokee L models will be offered with rear- and four-wheel drive, with three different four-wheel-drive systems to choose from, depending on trim level. The standard engine across all four trims (Laredo, Limited, Overland and Summit) is the familiar 3.6-liter V-6 making 293 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The optional motor, available only in the 4×4 Overland and Summit, is the venerable 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, pumping out 357 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but four-wheel drive is an option — the Laredo and Limited get the Quadra-Trac I full-time four-wheel drive, but the more off-road-oriented Overland gets the Quadra-Trac II with a two-speed transfer case. The top Summit trim gets the Quadra-Drive II system that adds an electronic limited-slip differential, also available on the Overland as part of an option package. \n\nI sampled two versions of the Grand Cherokee L: a V-6-powered Overland and a V-8-powered Summit. The V-6 provides adequate punch off the line, but its job is more about smoothness and efficiency than brute power. The Grand Cherokee L felt like the big SUV that it is around town and out on the highway, but the new steering and suspension tuning do give it a very buttoned-down feel. It feels like a big, substantial SUV, because that’s exactly what it is — but it’s not floaty, not tippy, and it exhibits outstanding body control. Even the brakes feel excellent, with firm, progressive action that isn’t grabby or soft. You can hustle the big SUV around on twisty back roads to levels that would make the family protest in nausea, if you’re so inclined, but it really is happiest just being a big, plush station wagon that can scale impressive boulders if need be. \n\nGraduating up a few more kilodollars to the Summit trim level equipped with the Hemi V-8 brings an entirely different perspective. This is the one that feels like a Land Rover Range Rover competitor … because it is. The V-8’s riverine power delivery is boundless and smooth, with acceleration coming quickly and effortlessly whenever you want it. The bigger wheels and tires don’t affect the ride at all, and in fact, the Summit actually felt smoother and even more well damped than the Overland did, despite both of those trim levels coming with standard air suspension and active electronic shock absorbers. \n\nOverall, every level of the new Grand Cherokee L’s driving dynamics feels top-notch, sophisticated and more refined than the previous model, which wasn’t exactly a slouch in this department to begin with. The biggest improvement might be in steering feel — Jeep engineers have managed to make an SUV that provides both ease of use and sufficient responsiveness and feedback so as to not feel like you’re using a video game steering wheel, something that can’t be said for other big three-row SUVs. \n\nStill Does Jeep Things\n\nOf course, no update to a Jeep Grand Cherokee — new long wheelbase or not — would be appropriate without a demonstration of its continued off-road prowess, and this model is certainly no slouch in that department either. Jeep set up an off-road course in Chelsea with the help of the fine folks at the Jeep Jamboree USA and sent us through it in Overland models, currently the best-equipped trim to handle such activities until a Trailhawk arrives (if it even does for the Grand Cherokee L). All models except the Laredo get a variant of the new Selec-Terrain system that adjusts things like throttle, braking, all-wheel-drive engagement, torque split and other systems per the environment being traversed. There’s honestly not much to say here except that the new Grand Cherokee L scales anything you throw it at with a level of posh, air-conditioned comfort that honestly feels like cheating — going over a hill of boulders is supposed to be challenging, rough work, but you can sit back, turn on the massaging seats, enjoy the available lush McIntosh-branded premium audio system and let the Jeep do all the work. The new Grand Cherokee L has more ground clearance than the old Grand Cherokee, and still features the requisite underbody skid plate protection and outstanding approach and departure angles that help it scale terrain that you’d have trouble walking over.\n\nDid You Say Massaging Seats?\n\nYep, I sure did. Jeep (and all the brands at parent company Stellantis, formerly known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) has been producing some amazing interiors in recent years, even leading us to declare the Ram 1500 our 2020 Luxury Car of the Year. With the designers setting their sights on the new Jeep Cherokee, you’d expect that the next-generation model would be something special, and you’d be right.\n\nEverything inside is new, with a new design theme, too — a kind of wing that extends from side to side, again emphasizing the width of the cabin. Panels slope away from the driver to aid in that feeling of expansiveness, and in higher-trim levels, large digital screens are seemingly everywhere. The new Uconnect 5 multimedia system measures 10.1 inches (a smaller 8.4-inch screen is standard in lesser trims), and it’s a joy to use. The optional 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster is reconfigurable to a few different looks including a full-screen navigation option. The optional 10-inch head-up display features the duplication of a lot of other information, allowing you to reconfigure things like the gauge cluster for navigation, the central screen for audio or other apps, and leaving all your relevant driving information on the HUD.\n\nMaterials quality is outstanding across the board. Even the basic Laredo has fine cloth seats, stitching on the dash and doors (even the rear ones) and high-quality soft-touch plastics throughout. The top-of-the-line Summit trim with the Summit Reserve Package is outright stunning, especially in its exclusive Tupelo brown-and-black interior. Leather quality is excellent, the metal trim looks and feels like metal trim, the steering wheel is chunky and hefty in your hands and all the controls are logically laid out. Of the interior concerns, there are only two obvious ones: First, there’s a lot of shiny black plastic surfaces on the center console. The touchscreen, the cupholder doors, the console buttons — everything is shiny black plastic, and that’s going to be a fingerprint magnet in a family vehicle like this. The other quibble is the positioning of the climate control buttons — they’re low and angled such that they’re almost vertical, making some of them hard to see from the driver’s seat. \n\nHow’s That Third Row?\n\nBut the point of the “L” in Grand Cherokee L is the fact that this is a three-row Grand, the first ever. Jeep engineers did a decent job of putting room for two in the cargo area, with a seat that’s wide enough and tall enough to fit two full-size humans in it in a pinch, and it’s easy to get into and out of thanks to the tilt-and-slide second row. The fact that the second row slides is also key because it will be necessary for second- and third-row passengers to negotiate legroom between them. There isn’t much foot room in the third row for adults, and the high floor in the rear does result in a knees-up seating position, not unlike that in the Ford Explorer (another rear-wheel-drive three-row SUV). It’s not as spacious in that third row as it is in a Volkswagen Atlas or Hyundai Palisade, but neither of those front-wheel-drive car-based SUVs has the capability that the Grand Cherokee L delivers for towing, off-roading or even flat-out luxury appointments.\n\nPick Your Price\n\nWhile the top-spec versions of the Grand Cherokee have increasingly been seen as viable luxury vehicles and status symbols, it’s good to know that Jeep hasn’t completely abandoned the lower end of the family spectrum with this latest update. The entry level for the Grand Cherokee L will be the Laredo trim with rear-wheel drive, starting at $38,690, including an increasingly obscene $1,695 delivery fee (included in all prices here). Add $2,000 for 4×4 across the board to all prices. From there is the slightly nicer 4×2 Limited for $45,690, while the 4×2 Overland off-road oriented trim starts at a heftier $54,690. The most luxurious version is the Summit, which starts at $58,690 for a 4×2 version, while the fully loaded 4×4 Summit Reserve Package with the V-6 will run you $63,690; with the V-8 it’s $66,985. This one, as I mentioned before, is Land Rover territory. \n\nThat’s quite a spread in pricing between the topmost and lowest trims: nearly $30,000. But it’s not all that different from the range the Grand Cherokee commands today. The Grand Cherokee L maintains the Cherokee’s status as an excellent off-roader and luxurious SUV but now adds a greater dash of practicality as a family vehicle thanks to the expanded seating. And lest you think $67,000 is a lot of money for a Jeep SUV, don’t forget that the new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are also on the way: bigger body-on-frame truck-based SUVs that will hit the $100,000 mark, fully optioned up. But if you don’t need something quite so big and ostentatious, the new 2021 Grand Cherokee L is easily a match for the latest Ford Explorer or nearly any of the rear-wheel-drive SUVs still out there — and better than a lot of the front-wheel-drive ones, too. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for Jeep in 2021?\n2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe Plug-In Hybrid Launch Editions Priced Just Under $50,000\nIt’s the 2021 Model Year, but Jeep Anniversary Editions Are Celebrating the 80s\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Will Cost More Than Two-Row Siblings\nWhat Is Stellantis?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The three-row Jeep Grand Cherokee L was introduced for 2021 to give families more passenger space than the standard two-row Grand Cherokee, but with a more affordable price tag than the all-new, super-sized Grand Wagoneer. The Grand Cherokee L offers seating for up to seven and a standard V-6 or optional V-8 engine with rear- or four-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L First Drive Review: A Benchmark Just Got Better (and Bigger)\n\nAlthough the Grand Cherokee L is a standalone model, it bears a family resemblance to the redesigned 2022 Grand Cherokee, sharing many styling elements with its two-row sibling. For 2022, Jeep says the Grand Cherokee L will also share the new Grand Cherokee’s tech-packed cabin, with a plethora of screens to keep passengers informed, connected and entertained — or just quiet. In addition to upgraded technology, the 2022 Grand Cherokee L will offer new exterior appearance packages and, eventually, hands-free lane centering on select trims.\n\nMore Screen Time\n\nThe Grand Cherokee L’s front passenger will get an available 10.25-inch touchscreen in the dashboard ahead of them that makes it easier to stay connected to the trip, monitor backseat entertainment or, for all you introverts, avoid conversations with the driver. Standard on Summit Reserve models and available on the Limited, Overland and Summit, the screen displays co-pilot assistance with navigation, camera viewing and entertainment features. Jeep says the passenger screen will be available later in 2022.\n\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L | Manufacturer image\n\nTo make family road trips more bearable — or even enjoyable at all — the 2022 Grand Cherokee L gains an available rear-seat entertainment system. The dual 10.1-inch displays have built-in Amazon Fire TV that can stream videos through the vehicle’s Wi-Fi or a mobile hot spot, similar to an offering in the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Passengers can also watch downloaded content without a connection through the system’s built-in storage.  The dual screens can display individual content or a mirror view, and grown ups stay in control of the rear-seat entertainment through the new front passenger screen.\n\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L | Cars.com photo by Jennifer Geiger\nNew Exterior Packages\n\nThe Grand Cherokee L also gains two appearance packages for 2022: Limited Black and Summit High Altitude. Both packages add gloss-black aluminum wheels (20 inches for the Limited and 21 inches for the Summit), distinct accents and badging, roof rails and a unique grille design. Grand Cherokee L shoppers will have three new exterior colors to choose from on select trims: Ember, Hydro Blue and Midnight Sky.\n\nHands-Free Steering\n\nThe current Grand Cherokee L is packed with safety and driver-assist features, including  Active Driving Assist, a system that combines adaptive cruise control with hands-on lane centering. A spokesperson for Jeep confirmed that an upgrade to hands-free lane centering will be available for the Overland and Summit with late availability for 2022. The more advanced system, called Hands-free Active Driving Assist, allows for hands-free lane centering at all speeds on designated roadways. That reads similar to the core capabilities of advanced systems offered by BMW, Ford, GM, Toyota and, soon, Nissan. All of them employ devices to monitor the driver and ensure they’re paying attention to take back over at any time, a protocol that’s all but certain with Jeep’s Hands-free Active Driving Assist. The system will also automatically slow the vehicle on tight curves and resume control once the driver verifies that he or she is paying attention.\n\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L | Manufacturer image\nTrims and Pricing\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee L is currently available in six trims: Laredo, Altitude, Limited, Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve; a 4xe plug-in hybrid model will be available in early 2022.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nAn extended-length version of the two-row Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Grand Cherokee L is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seating and space for up to seven; should you prefer the optional second-row captain’s chairs, seating capacity drops to six. A 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is standard, with a 357-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 optional. Both can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Jeep offers several adventure-ready options, including an air suspension with driver-selectable ride height, a choice of three four-wheel-drive systems, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Explorer, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride and Subaru Ascent.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee L rolls into the 2024 model year with no significant changes. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nCloth upholstery\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning \nSatellite radio\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\n19-speaker audio system\nPanoramic sunroof\nAir suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nIf you like the five-seat Grand Cherokee but need more space, the Grand Cherokee L is worth a test drive. Smaller and less expensive than the Jeep Wagoneer, the Grand Cherokee L has an optional V-8 that gives the added punch you need for quick passing maneuvers. It also bumps this SUV’s maximum towing capacity to 7,200 pounds versus 6,200 pounds with the V-6. Scaling up to higher trims sends the price soaring, but in those uplevel models, the Grand Cherokee L’s cabin looks and feels every bit as luxurious as many premium-brand SUVs. Options like a front-passenger touchscreen, rear-seat entertainment system and higher-end leather trim give this Jeep a definite wow factor when you step inside.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nAn extended-length version of the two-row Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Jeep Grand Cherokee L is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seats and space for up to seven. Should you prefer the optional second-row captain’s chairs, seating capacity drops to six. A 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain; it can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive. Jeep offers several adventure-ready options, including an air suspension with driver-selectable ride height, a choice of three 4WD systems, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Its cabin really sets the Grand Cherokee L apart; it’s extremely spacious, and the upper trims are downright luxurious. Competitors include the Kia Telluride, Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Traverse, Hyundai Palisade and Subaru Ascent. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee L carries over unchanged for 2025, though Jeep has lowered starting prices across the board. The previously available 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 was discontinued during the 2024 model year, leaving the current lineup with only the V-6 engine.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\nSatellite radio\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\n19-speaker audio system\nPanoramic moonroof\nAir suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nIf you like the five-seat Grand Cherokee but need more space, the Grand Cherokee L is worth a test drive. Smaller and less expensive than the Jeep Wagoneer, the Grand Cherokee L has a maximum towing capacity of 6,200 pounds — most three-row rivals, including the Honda Pilot and Toyota Grand Highlander, max out at 5,000 pounds. Scaling up to higher trims sends the price soaring, but in those uplevel models, the Grand Cherokee L’s cabin looks and feels every bit as luxurious as many premium-brand SUVs. Options like a front-passenger touchscreen, rear-seat entertainment system and upmarket leather trim give this Jeep a definite wow factor when you step inside.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nAn extended-length version of the two-row Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Grand Cherokee L is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seating and space for up to seven; should you prefer the optional second-row captain’s chairs, occupancy drops to six. A 290-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is standard, with a 357-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 optional. Both can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Jeep offers several adventure-ready options, including an air suspension with driver-selectable ride height, a choice of three four-wheel-drive systems, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. The cabin really sets the Grand Cherokee L apart; it’s extremely spacious, and the upper trims are downright luxurious. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Explorer, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride and Subaru Ascent.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee L rolls into the 2023 model year with only minor changes related to feature availability. Overland and Limited trims now come standard with a 10.1-inch touchscreen and navigation, and the available premium audio systems can now be had as stand-alone options rather than part of pricier option groups.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nCloth upholstery\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nTri-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning system\nSatellite radio\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\n19-speaker audio system\nPanoramic sunroof\nAir suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L?\n\nIf you like the five-seat Grand Cherokee but need more space inside, the Grand Cherokee L is worth a test drive. Smaller and less expensive than the Jeep Wagoneer, the Grand Cherokee L has an optional V-8 that gives the added punch you need for quick passing maneuvers. It also bumps the SUV’s maximum towing capacity to 7,200 pounds versus 6,200 pounds with the V-6. Scaling up to higher trims sends the price soaring, but the Grand Cherokee L’s cabin looks and feels every bit as luxurious as many premium-brand SUVs. Options like a front-passenger touchscreen, rear-seat entertainment system, and upmarket leather trim trim give this Jeep a definite “wow” factor when you step inside.",
