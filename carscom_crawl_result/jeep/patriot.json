      "expert_review": "For the money, the all-new Jeep Patriot just might be the best SUV bargain on the market.\n\nWith a 2008 starting price of $16,035, including freight, you’ll get a nicely styled Sport model that looks a lot like the old Jeep Cherokee, and is even about the same size. This vehicle was introduced for 2007 at a price just over $15,000, but the base price has grown $925 after a year on the market. (Our tester was the 2007 base model, whose sticker price was $15,110.\n\nAt the base price, the Patriot lacks a few of the amenities that more-expensive vehicles offer, such as power windows, mirrors and door locks.\n\nBut it does include a lot more standard equipment than you would expect for such a great price, including air conditioning, an AM/FM/compact-disc player with iPod connection, and great safety features such as electronic stability control, antilock brakes, traction control, and even side-curtain air bags for both rows of seats.\n\nThe starting price brings the Patriot with front-wheel drive, so it’s not suitable for rugged off-roading. It also has a five-speed manual gearbox.\n\nYou can tack on a continuously variable automatic transmission for an additional $1,100. Extras such as power windows, mirrors and door locks (with remote) come in a $2,225 package that also brings tinted glass, reclining front bucket seats, a 60/40 split-folding rear seat, illuminated entry, front map lights, cruise control, and even Chrysler’s new Yes Essentials stain-resistant cloth seats.\n\nAdd the automatic transmission and options package to the base price, and you’ll get a downright fancy Patriot for $19,350, which still is a bargain in a market where the typical midsize SUV starts in the mid-$20,000s. Even some compact models about the size of the Patriot – or smaller — begin well above $20,000.\n\nOur test vehicle was the base model with the manual gearbox and crank windows, and I was fine with that – especially at a price comparable to that of a much smaller car such as a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic.\n\nFor everyday city driving, I probably would add just the automatic transmission, making the total price $17,135.\n\nYou can get a base four-wheel-drive Sport model for $17,785, including the amenities standard on the two-wheel-drive Sport model. It comes with the Freedom I drive system, which is suitable for foul-weather and limited off-road driving. Adding the automatic and options package to this would take the price up to $21,110, but you would have a vehicle equipped as well as some of the other compact crossover-style SUVs that cost in the mid-$20,000s.\n\nFor serious off-roading, you can upgrade to the Freedom Drive II system, which has low-range gearing that allows the Patriot to receive Jeep’s coveted Trail Rated designation.\n\nUnlike other Jeep off-road systems, though, the Patriot’s Freedom Drive II does not have a separate transfer case that allows the transmission to operate in low range. Instead, the special off-road automatic transmission has a low first gear (19:1 ratio) that is similar to the first gear of a Jeep Wrangler operating in low range. With the Patriot shifted into this low gear, it will crawl at less than 5 mph. This transmission is $1,050, and comes in place of the one offered on two-wheel-drive models.\n\nAdding this off-road system, along with some required upgrades, will tack on about $3,600 to the base price. But then the Patriot can be driven on such routes as the Rubicon Trail, the legendary off-road course through the Sierra Nevada range in Northern California. This is where all off-road-capable Jeep vehicles are tested to make sure they can qualify for the Trail Rated designation.\n\nThe top Patriot model is the Limited, priced at $20,755 for two-wheel drive and $22,505 with the Freedom Drive I four-wheel-drive system. This model includes most of the items that are optional on the Sport, although the automatic transmission is still an add-on, as it the Freedom Drive II system ($745). Leather upholstery is standard.\n\nWith the Freedom Drive II upgrade, you’ll get some other extras that help with off-roading, such as a locking differential, underbody skid plates, full-size spare tire, tow hooks, all-terrain tires, 17-inch alloy wheels, and hill-descent control. Patriot models with the Trail Rated designation come with a one-inch higher ground clearance (9 inches), which helps negotiate rocks and other obstacles on the trail.\n\nAs an off-road explorer, I’d prefer the Freedom Drive II system, but I could live without the other extras, such as power windows and door locks. The only item on that $2,225 options package that I would miss would be the cruise control, which is nice for long highway trips.\n\nThe styling of the Patriot is quite Jeeplike, even though this vehicle is built on the same architecture as that of the Dodge Caliber and Jeep Compass hatchbacks. Chrysler has taken this platform and turned it into a vehicle that is every bit as good as the original Cherokee, which debuted in the early 1980s and hung around until it was replaced by the Liberty for 2002.\n\nThe second-generation Liberty, new for 2008, has styling quite similar to that of the Patriot, but is slightly larger and more powerful, not to mention more expensive – with a starting price nearly $4,000 more than that of the Patriot. The Liberty has a 3.7-liter V-6 engine with 210 horsepower.\n\nUnder the hood of the Patriot is the same 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine found in a variety of Chrysler products, including the Caliber, Compass, midsize Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring sedans, and the Chrysler PT Cruiser wagon.\n\nIt’s Chrysler’s new “world engine,” and is rated at 172 horsepower and 165 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings, using the new, more-realistic 2008 formula, are 23 miles per gallon in the city and 27 highway with two-wheel drive and the manual transmission, and 21 city/25 highway with the automatic. Four-wheel-drive models are rated at 22/27 (manual) and 20/24 (automatic).\n\nThe Compass and Patriot come standard with front-wheel drive, while two-wheel-drive versions of the Liberty, Jeep Grand Cherokee, seven-passenger Jeep Commander, and Wrangler Unlimited come with rear drive.\n\nSome off-road purists complain that Chrysler is weakening its Jeep brand by introducing models that aren’t what they would call real Jeeps, and they include both the Patriot and Compass in their argument. But as I’ve said before, anything that helps keep the Jeep brand financially healthy, such as volume sales of different Jeep-branded vehicles, is a good thing.\n\nThe Patriot and Compass are designed to help move the Jeep brand into the mainstream, so Chrysler can continue to develop and produce niche vehicles such as the Wrangler and the new four-door Wrangler Unlimited model that arrived for 2007. The slightly smaller Compass is not Trail Rated in any form, but it does offer a basic all-wheel-drive system that is useful for limited off-road driving, such as on improved dirt roads in our national and state parks.\n\nBecause of both its pricing and styling, the Patriot should appeal to those who once bought the Cherokee. A lot more people will be able to afford a Patriot than a similarly equipped Liberty.\n\nThe Patriot has the traditional round Jeep headlights and seven-slot grille, the boxy Jeep side view with trapezoidal wheel openings, a clamshell hood, and what Jeep calls “robust” bumpers. It is, Jeep says, the “latest iteration of the Jeep classic design.” Its styling also is similar to that of the full-size, seven-passenger Commander, whose own styling was based on that of the Cherokee and the earlier Jeep Wagoneer models.\n\nThe Patriot seats five, and even rear passengers have decent legroom.\n\nPower is more than sufficient for a vehicle of this size, although consumers who like to accelerate quickly and drive fast probably wouldn’t be satisfied. For my own tastes, though, the 2.4-liter engine is just fine.\n\nThe Patriot is built in the same Chrysler factory as the Compass and Caliber, in Belvidere, Ill.\n\nAt a Glance: 2008 Jeep Patriot\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder, front- or four-wheel-drive crossover utility vehicle.\n\nHighlights: This is all-new vehicle joined the Jeep lineup for 2007, with styling and a size similar to the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. It is based on the architecture of the Dodge Caliber and Jeep Compass hatchbacks, and has good power, decent fuel economy, a roomy interior, and great Jeeplike styling.\n\nNegatives: No engine upgrade offered for those who want more power.\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder.\n\nTransmissions: Five-speed manual; choice of two continuously variable automatics (on- and off-road versions).\n\nPower/torque: 172 HP/165 foot-pounds.\n\nLength: 173.6 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,108-3,326 pounds.\n\nCargo volume: 23 cubic feet (behind rear seat); 53.6 cubic feet (rear seat folded).\n\nTrailer towing capacity: 2,000 pounds (with factory tow package); 1,000 pounds (without tow package).\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard.\n\nSide air bags: Side curtain standard, both rows.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 13.6 gallons/unleaded regular (13.5 gallons with all-wheel drive)/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy (2008 formula) : 23 miles per gallon city/27 highway (manual, 2WD); 21 city/25 highway (CVT, 2WD); 22 city/27 highway (manual, 4WD); 20 city/24 highway (CVT, 4WD).\n\nMajor competitors: Scion xB, Subaru Forester, Suzuki SX4, Kia Rondo, Nissan Versa five-door.\n\nBase price range: $15,475-$21,945 plus $560 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $16,035 including freight (2WD, manual).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "I suppose you can’t blame Jeep for wanting to make hay while the sun shines. After years of being limited to only a few models, we now have the Jeep Commander, Jeep Compass, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Wrangler, and now the latest addition, the Jeep Patriot.\n\nWe are, then, looking at some narrowing niches, especially with the Patriot and the Compass. Beneath the skin, they are near-twins, both based on the Dodge Caliber platform. When I asked a company representative why they thought they needed both the Compass and the Patriot, he said that in early consumer clinics, women seemed to like the Compass, men preferred the Patriot. Rather than choose one, Jeep decided to build both.\n\nThe central difference, aside from the Patriot’s slightly more macho, squared-off styling, is that while the Compass makes no pretense about the fact that it is strictly a car-based “crossover” SUV with no real off-road talent, Jeep suggests that the Patriot, properly equipped, is at least moderately “trail-rated,” which is the Jeep term for backwoods ability. To be trail-rated, you need to opt for the “Off-Road Group” on the Patriot options list, which gives you all-wheel-drive, underbody skid plates, low-range gearing, different tires and wheels and other rugged accouterments.\n\nOur test Patriot was strictly a city slicker, with front-wheel-drive and plenty of comfort features. Not a poser, exactly, but for a Jeep, it was pretty mild-mannered. It was the base Sport model, with the Limited being the more upscale version.\n\nStill, the Patriot was nicely appointed, but its sticker price, $20,215, was a long way from the starting price of $14,425. For that, you don’t even get air conditioning, but you do get antilock brakes, side and side curtain airbags, electronic stability control, traction control, a tilt steering wheel and a decent AM/FM stereo with CD player.\n\nOur Patriot had a “preferred” package that, for $2,350, added air conditioning; power mirrors, locks and windows; keyless entry; and a few other features. Seventeen-inch tires and wheels were $580, a towing preparation group was $130 — that didn’t include a hitch — and another package combined a lot of small items such as daytime running lights, a trip computer, a garage-door opener and a security alarm for $830. Floor mats were $30, the CVT transmission, which replaces the standard five-speed manual, was $1,050, and with $560 in shipping, we’re a little over $20,000. See how quick that happens?\n\nThe CVT, or continuously variable transmission, works like an automatic, but doesn’t have a set number of four, five or six gears. You just shift into drive, press the accelerator, and the 2.4-liter, 172-horsepower four-cylinder engine goes to work with the mild drone that we’ve become accustomed to hearing with CVTs. Certain manufacturers, such as Chrysler and Nissan, are sold on CVTs, but I still prefer a transmission that shifts. Of course, someone who was raised on the never-shifting CVT might hop in a regular automatic transmission-equipped car and wonder, “Why is it jerking like that?” To each his own.\n\nThe test Patriot, a 2007 model, is essentially identical to a 2008, but for one thing: Our 2007 still carried the old EPA mileage rating of 24 mpg city, 27 highway. The 2008 model is rated at 21 mpg city, 25 mpg highway. There’s no difference in the vehicle, only in the ratings method. The Patriot is offered with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but I haven’t driven one with that engine — the majority you’ll find on dealer lots will have the 2.4.\n\nOn the road, the Patriot is pretty much what you’d expect: A reasonably roomy, nicely conceived SUV that seats four adults in moderate comfort, five in less comfort. The interior, with lots of faux-aluminum trim, is handsome and functional. Instruments and controls look and feel like the ones on the Dodge Caliber, as they should, since they’re the same. The cloth-covered bucket seats were a little on the thin side, but otherwise supportive and comfortable. Upgrade to the Patriot Limited and you can deck out the interior with a navigation system, leather upholstery and a power sunroof, but you could also find the sticker price nudging $25,000.\n\nThe problem with the Patriot is not the vehicle itself, but with its competition. It plays in one of the toughest leagues in the business, as lots of manufacturers have solid small SUVs in the $20,000 range. The Jeep name carries more than its share of cache, and that should help give the Patriot a leg up.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSharing a platform with the Jeep Compass, the Patriot is supposed to be more rugged. It seats five people. To give its macho looks some teeth, the Patriot is available with two four-wheel-drive systems. The more capable of the two gets Jeep’s Trail-Rated designation, meaning it can meet certain off-road standards for traction, water fording, ground clearance and more. Patriot competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester.\n\nNew for 2013\nFront-wheel-drive models equipped with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission now get an EPA-estimated 30-mpg highway, up 1 mpg.\n\n\nExterior\nThe Patriot has a seven-slot grille, round headlights and trapezoidal wheel openings. Other exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard side roof rails\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels; 17-inch aluminum rims optional\nStandard fog lights\nOptional power heated side mirrors\nOptional power sunroof\n\nInterior\nTwo rows of seats provide room for five. All Patriot models have a rechargeable flashlight. Other interior features include:\n\n\nStandard cloth upholstery; leather optional\nStandard 60/40-split folding backseat\nStandard outside temperature gauge\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional flat-folding front-passenger seat\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional air conditioning\nOptional power windows, locks and side mirrors\nOptional touch-screen stereo with 28-gigabyte hard drive\nOptional Boston Acoustics audio with speakers that swing down from the liftgate\nOptional Garmin-based navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo four-cylinder engines are available for the Patriot. Both come standard with a five-speed manual transmission. A continuously variable automatic transmission is optional.\nBuyers have three drivelines to choose from: front-wheel drive; Freedom Drive I four-wheel drive with lock mode; and Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package, a Trail-Rated four-wheel-drive system. Freedom Drive II has a CVT that incorporates a low range for off-road driving. The package also includes 17-inch all-terrain tires, a full-size spare tire and tow hooks. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nBase 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\nAvailable 172-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder\nBoth engines use regular gas\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with electronic roll mitigation\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard traction control\nOptional side-impact airbags for the front seats",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSharing a platform with the Jeep Compass and Dodge Caliber, the Patriot is supposed to be the most rugged of the three. It seats five people. To give its macho looks some teeth, the Patriot is available with two four-wheel-drive systems. The more capable of the two gets Jeep’s Trail-Rated designation, meaning it can meet certain off-road standards for traction, water fording, ground clearance and more. Patriot competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Jeep Patriot’s continuously variable automatic transmission has been refined for 2012, offering smoother deceleration, better initial acceleration, reduced engine noise and a more responsive gas pedal, Jeep says.\n\nExterior\nThe Patriot has a seven-slot grille, round headlights and trapezoidal wheel-well openings. Last year, the crossover got a new front bumper that repositioned the standard fog lights. Other exterior features include:\n\nStandard side roof rails\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels; 17-inch aluminum rims optional\nOptional power heated side mirrors\nOptional sunroof\n\nInterior\nTwo rows of seats provide room for five. All Patriot models have a rechargeable flashlight. Other interior features include:\n\nStandard cloth upholstery; leather optional\nStandard 60/40-split folding backseat\nStandard outside temperature gauge\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nStandard illuminated cupholders\nOptional flat-folding front-passenger seat\nOptional heated front seats\nOptional air conditioning\nOptional power windows, locks and side mirrors\nOptional touch-screen stereo with 28-gigabyte hard drive\nOptional Boston Acoustics audio with speakers that swing down from the liftgate\nOptional Garmin-based navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo four-cylinder engines are available for the Patriot. Both come standard with a five-speed manual transmission. A CVT is optional.\nBuyers have three drivelines to choose from: front-wheel drive; Freedom Drive I four-wheel drive with lock mode; and Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package, a Trail-Rated four-wheel-drive system. Freedom Drive II has a CVT that incorporates a low range for off-road driving. The package also includes 17-inch all-terrain tires, a full-size spare tire and tow hooks. Mechanical features include:\n\nBase 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\nAvailable 172-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder\nBoth engines use regular gas\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with electronic roll mitigation\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard traction control\nOptional side-impact airbags for the front seats",

      "expert_review": "Everyone deserves a do-over.\n\nThat’s not to make excuses or not to hold a company accountable for misdeeds, but do-overs are as American as apple pie. Few places in the world offer the chance to make amends and reinvent yourself like America.\n\nSo if that’s our United States, why shouldn’t a Patriot deserve a second shot?\n\nThe 2009 Jeep Patriot is the off-roader Jeep should have introduced when it debuted at the trailhead in December 2006.\n\nIt was the right idea: a little SUV that could get groceries while crossing the Rubicon Trail; that 2007 model was just poorly executed. What Jeep tried to sell as austere was just incomplete. Hey, they screwed up: Vinyl floors, chunks of hard plastic, poor craftsmanship and crank windows don’t cut it these days.\n\nThe 2009 compact SUV, which is really a crossover built on the same platform as the Jeep Compass and Dodge Caliber, has been upgraded throughout. This wasn’t a mid-cycle refresh, it was an apology.\n\nLittle details make a design, and the previous Patriot was still a first draft.\n\nNow, it’s vastly improved. Chrome accents are now around the dash vents, softer armrests are on the overhauled door panel and illuminated cup holders make the trip a little more bearable.\n\nReally, you don’t know what you’re missing inside a Patriot until you park a 2008 model next to a 2009. Then when you look inside, you say things like, “wow, the ’08 really bites.” Improvements were necessary\n\nThe problems with the Patriot were never about performance, but that’s improved too.\n\nIt’s quite capable. My test vehicle, the high-end Limited, was powered on the 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder engine. It pounds out a respectable 172 horsepower and 165-pound-feet of torque. (That’s an upgrade over the base 158 horsepower, 141-pound-feet torque 2-liter engine.)\n\nIt buzzes along the highway quite nicely. It’s quieter now that Jeep has installed sound dampening materials on the floor and inside the engine compartment. It’s also retuned the exhaust. It’s not silent in the cabin when you’re going 70 mph, but it’s easy enough to hold a conversation.\n\nThe ride is fairly smooth, but still feels more truck-like, which fits a Jeep’s character.\n\nJeep’s Continuously Variable Transmission also seems to have lost its bipolar disorder in which it would jump around and run at only highs or lows. Jeep has made its partial zero emission vehicle powertrain option available on front-wheel drive-only models too, something that wasn’t available before.\n\nOne area Jeep didn’t have to improve was the vehicle’s gas mileage. While there are five different drivetrain configurations, all of the mileage numbers are good — spanning from 20 miles per gallon city/22 mpg highway for the top of the line 4×4 to 23 mpg city/27 mpg highway for a front-wheel drive with a five-speed manual.\n\nWhile I did not test the 2009 model’s off-road abilities this time, I have driven the Patriot on some extremely tough terrain in the past without any problems. The Freedom II off road package can handle almost everything a person can throw at it.\n\nHowever, I imagine the toughest course most Patriot drivers will tackle are dirt roads or heavy snow. The locking differential will gobble those up without a problem. Driving experience enhanced\n\nSince the Patriot is so new, restyling a perfectly good exterior wasn’t needed. In many ways, it looks like a baby Grand Cherokee — that’s not a bad thing to have in your DNA. The two-box design, seven slot grille and distinctive trapezoidal fenders all give the Patriot a Jeep-tough look. The curvy Compass shows you what can happen when non-Jeep people start designing Jeeps.\n\nBut the problem with the Patriot was always the interior, and that’s where the bulk of the upgrades are.\n\nWinning over Jeep enthusiasts was never a problem. They love Jeeps, so they’ll buy Jeeps. But anyone not accustomed to some of the idiosyncrasies of the Jeep life may not enjoy cutting their fingers while adjusting the heater vent or catching a cold from a windy draft from a bad seal.\n\nThe Patriot needs more to find new people to rally around the brand.\n\nThe starting price may be low at $18,170, but people won’t stay in a vehicle long if they think they paid too much. The competition — the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV 4 — cost more but have much more refined interiors. They’re comfortable, quiet and enhance the driving experience. The original Patriot’s interior forced drivers to endure a trip, not enjoy it.\n\nNow, it’s more respectable, but there’s still some room for improvement. Jeep may have closed the gap with its major competition but it has not caught up.\n\nThe new instrument panel is easy to read and cleaner. There’s a nice curve along the dash and the chrome-outlined vents add a nice touch to the other splashes of chrome in the cabin. The redesigned center console is much better with more padding on the armrests and more space inside.\n\nI don’t like the setup of the new My Gig system. Burning CDs from the driver’s seat is out of fashion and working navigation system is difficult. Additionally, the auxiliary jack on the stereo face is so 2007. Place that plug and the USB adapter into the center console. The nine-speaker stereo system, however, will rock louder than you’ll ever need, and the articulating speakers on the tailgate — they fold down when the liftgate is open — is a neat surprise.\n\nNice surprises are what win customers and the 2009 Patriot offers a few. It’s one thing to poorly build a product and then try to act as if everything is fine. It’s another to measure your mistakes and fix them.\n\nThe new Patriot reinvents itself in a much better light. In the land of second chances, it’s not always what you do with the first opportunity, but the character you show to admit you’re wrong and try again.\n\nIf Jeep really wanted to make excuses, it could point out that the original Patriot was built while the company was under German rule. “You vill save Der Vater Kompany’s money.”\n\nAnd look how many do-overs that country has gotten through the years.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nSharing a platform with the Jeep Compass and Dodge Caliber, the Patriot is supposed to be the most rugged of the three. It seats five people. To give its macho looks some teeth, the Patriot is available with two four-wheel-drive systems. The more capable of the two gets Jeep’s Trail-Rated designation, meaning it’s capable of meeting certain off-road standards for traction, water fording, ground clearance and more. Patriot competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester.\n\nNew for 2011\nMinor front and rear styling tweaks distinguish the 2011 Patriot from its predecessor, and maximum ground clearance increases to 9.5 inches, when properly equipped. The Patriot’s steering and suspension systems have also been upgraded for better ride and handling, according to Jeep.\n\nExterior\nThe Patriot has a seven-slot grille, rounded headlights and trapezoidal wheel-well openings. The crossover gets a new front bumper that repositions the standard fog lights. Around back, there’s new rear bumper styling. Other exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard side roof rails\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels; 17-inch aluminum rims optional\nOptional power heated side mirrors\nOptional sunroof\n\nInterior\nTwo rows of seats provide room for five. The 2011 Patriot has a new steering wheel, new climate controls, padded upper front-door trim and a new center armrest.

      "expert_review": "I get why people love their Jeeps: They’re rough and tumble and go anywhere from a weekend at the beach to an extreme off-roading adventure. However, the 2010 Jeep Patriot feels cheap, sluggish and plastic-y, making it seem more like a toy Jeep than a real one (and not even a cute one like the miniature electric pink Barbie Jeep the neighbor girls have).\n\nUpon starting the Patriot for the first time, I realized pretty quickly that this wasn’t a toy electric Jeep. The rumbling engine actually made me wonder for a moment if my test Patriot had a diesel engine. Nope, no diesel, just a really loud cabin.\n\nI was not only underwhelmed with the Patriot but actually annoyed by the continuously variable automatic transmission in it, which was part of the Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package. It felt slow to get up and running from a stop, and if I tried to coax it to go any faster it would rev loudly as if to say, “The kids’ll get to school when I’m damn well ready to get them there.” Sheesh! On top of stressing about getting the kids out the door on time, I hated having my car bark at me every morning.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 2010 Patriot looks exactly like a Jeep and can’t possibly be mistaken for anything else. It has the bold, square lines that are associated with this brand. A vertically striped grille with the unmistakable Jeep lettering above it grabs your attention as does the big, bug-eyed headlights. It reminded me a bit of the old Jeep Cherokee that my dad drove when I was little, only without the retro wood paneling.\n\nWhat did seem kind of retro about the Patriot was the Sunburst Orange paint my test car came dressed up in. I can’t say I’m a fan of orange cars, but apparently plenty of people are.\n\nOne feature that certainly didn’t exist back when my dad was driving his Jeep was a remote start function. This would be an absolute dream in extreme weather, allowing you to stay inside the comfort of the coffee shop while you start up your Jeep and warm it (or cool it) to the optimal temperature before even stepping one foot outside the door. That might even be worth paying the extra $1,235 to get the feature as part of the Security and Cargo Convenience Package.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nInterior\n\nMy kids complained all week about the Patriot’s lack of legroom in the backseat. The rear seats seem stuck in the olden days since they don’t slide back and forth like many crossovers do these days. I ended up pulling the front passenger seat all the way forward to make room for the girls’ backpacks in the second row.\n\nOn top of that, the rear seats’ backrest sat nearly upright. Although they reclined slightly, it wasn’t enough to make my daughters’ booster seats rest comfortably against the seatback. This caused their heads to flop forward when they napped in the car (see picture in photo gallery). Anyone know a good pediatric chiropractor?\n\nAs if trying to make up for the lack of thought elsewhere, there are a few gadgety features thrown into the Patriot such as a rear overhead light that pops out for use as a flashlight (wait till the kids lose it) and rear speakers that flip down from the open liftgate to blast music outward for tailgating (part of the optional $1,295 Sun and Sound Package). These features are clever-ish, but not enough to make up for all of the plastic trim in the interior, which is kind of surprising for a $30,000 car. What did make me smile a bit was the optional stain- and odor-resistant seat upholstery and carpeting in the Patriot. Now we’re getting somewhere for those of us with kids.\n\nI also liked the leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls included in the Sun and Sound package. I’ve come to believe that steering-wheel-mounted controls are a safety feature and should be standard on every vehicle.\n\nThe Patriot has several standard storage options including a sliding armrest on the center console with a shallow tray on top, two cupholders in the front and two for the kids at the bottom rear of the center console (although they were tricky to reach while the kids were buckled in), and 60/40-split folding rear seats for an expandable cargo area.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Patriot’s Latch connectors were wedged between the seat cushions and a little tough to access, but with some elbow grease they were doable. The seat belt buckle receptors were on stable bases, making it easy for kids using booster seats to buckle on their own. The lack of legroom in the second row would make it difficult to fit a rear-facing child-safety seat in the backseat; however, a forward-facing convertible car seat should fit easily.\n\nThe Patriot has all of the standard safety features you’d expect to find, including antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. It also has front-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows. However, the Patriot doesn’t have standard side-impact airbags for the front row. They’re available as part of the $1,235 Security and Cargo Convenience Package. Without the side-impact airbags, the Patriot received a score of Marginal in side-impact crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. With the side-impact airbags, the Patriot scored the top score of Good.\n\nMy test car also came equipped with the $825 Freedom Drive II Off-Road Package, which includes four-wheel-drive off-road mode, an extra inch of ground clearance and hill descent control. I tried the hill descent control with a friend of mine who’s a professional driver, and … it works! Although, she commented about the “strange, chunky, hollow sound” it makes, much like the noise you’d hear when ABS kicks in.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Rear seats are behind the times and don’t slide front and back to make room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat.\n\nIn School: Tight legroom is tricky for little ones with backpacks to maneuver.\n\nTeens: Make sure to opt for the optional side-impact airbags if you’re going to put a teen driver behind the wheel.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Jeep Patriot compact crossover SUV shares its platform with the Jeep Compass and is the less expensive model. It seats five and comes with a choice of four-cylinder engines and front-wheel drive or one of two full-time four-wheel-drive systems. The more capable four-wheel-drive system gets Jeep’s Trail-Rated designation, meaning it can meet certain off-road standards for traction, water fording, ground clearance and more. Patriot competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester. The Patriot and Compass are due to be replaced by a new crossover SUV for the 2017 model year.\nNew for 2016\nThe Limited trim level is gone, leaving Sport and Latitude models. Bluetooth with hands-free calling and SiriusXM satellite radio with a one-year free subscription are now standard. A new Sport SE Package due in late 2015 includes steering-wheel audio controls, heated front seats, 17-inch aluminum wheels and unique exterior trim. A backup camera is a new option.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nSeats five\n60/40-split folding backseat\nFog lights\nBluetooth connectivity\nCruise control\n158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine\nRequired in every new car: front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\n172-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine\nFive-speed manual, six-speed automatic or continuously variable automatic transmission\nOff-road package with upgraded four-wheel-drive system\nAir conditioning\nPower windows\nBackup camera\nPower sunroof\nHeated leather front seats\nHeated power-adjustable side mirrors",
