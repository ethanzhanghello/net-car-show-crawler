      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Jeep Commander is the first Jeep to have three rows of seats; it seats up to seven people. Sport and Limited trim levels are available, as are three four-wheel-drive systems. The Commander’s competitors include the Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer.\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Commander dropped its 4.7-liter V-8 engine and the Overland trim.\n\nExterior\nThe Commander features an upright windshield and rear window. Its angular sheet metal and vertical side glass give it a classic Jeep profile and a rugged, upright, military look.\n\nStandard body-colored door handles and front/rear bumpers\nStandard power, heated mirrors\nStandard remote keyless entry\n17- or 18-inch wheels\nOptional xenon headlamps\nOptional dual-panel sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe SUV holds up to seven occupants on two or three rows of seats. Each row is slightly higher than the one ahead of it, enhancing forward visibility for rear occupants. The second- and third-row seats fold forward to create a flat load floor. A stepped roof provides headroom for rear occupants.\n\nCloth, leather or perforated leather upholstery\nWood-grain and leather-wrapped center console\nStandard air conditioning\nOptional dual-zone automatic climate control\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard steering-wheel-mounted cruise control\nStandard eight-way power driver seat and optional four-way power passenger seat\nOptional second-row overhead TV monitor and satellite television\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree full-time four-wheel-drive systems and two transfer cases are available. In ascending order of ruggedness, Jeep calls its four-wheel-drive systems Quadra-Trac I, Quadra-Trac II and Quadra-Drive II.\n\nHill descent control, which is designed to keep the SUV’s speed to a crawl when traversing difficult terrain, is optional. Hill start assist is also optional; it keeps the Commander from rolling backward on an incline. The 5.7-liter engine has a multi-displacement system that alternates between four-cylinder and V-8 mode for higher fuel efficiency.\n\n210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 with 235 pounds-feet of torque\n357-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 with 389 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed automatic transmission\nRear- and four-wheel-drive systems available\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nAvailable rear backup camera\nStandard side curtain airbags for all rows\nStandard antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nStandard Smart Key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt\nStandard rear park assist\nAvailable rain-sensing wipers and automatic headlamps",

      "expert_review": "Just ask the drivers of Scion xB or Honda Element or the nearest delivery van, and they’ll tell you they can cram a lot of stuff into their vehicles. In the cases of xB or Element, the interiors are surprisingly roomy compared with the diminutive exteriors.\n\nCommander is designed for the same effect, with its upright cabin and vertical tailgate. Simply put, Commander is a taller, boxier version of Grand Cherokee designed to maximize interior space and add a third road of passenger seats.\n\nThe third row has become a major selling point for midsize SUVs. Everything from Ford Explorer to Suzuki XL-7 offers a third row, even if sometimes, they’re only roomy enough for toddlers.\n\nBy the way, Jeep guys certainly remember the brawny Commando of the ’60s and ’70s, but despite the similarity of name, Commander is a totally different trip.\n\nCommander is an accommodating vehicle with a comfortable ride and an airy interior, thanks to the high roofline and upright windows. Even a tall guy could drive without doffing his 10-gallon cowboy hat.\n\nBut because of extra height and weight, Commander is a fairly ponderous vehicle to drive. The handling is responsive enough, but this truck feels bulky around town, with its soft suspension allowing too much wallow and body sway.\n\nAlso, the base-model test truck had only two-wheel drive, which would appear to limit its possibilities as a “trail-rated” Jeep.\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door SUV, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 235 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, 305 pound-feet torque at 3,600 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 109.5 inches.\n\nOverall length: 188.5 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,709 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 15 city, 19 highway.\n\nHighs: Comfortable ride, engine power, retro design.\n\nLows: Soft handling, poor fuel mileage, cramped rear seat.",

      "expert_review": "If you’re thinking about buying an old-school SUV like the Jeep Commander, I can only hope you’ve vetted the alternatives — crossovers, minivans, wagons — and discounted criteria like gas mileage and space efficiency. Your priorities should include romping about the backwoods and towing 7,000-plus pounds to Grandma’s house.\n\nThen, and only then, might the Commander be the vehicle for you. Mildly revamped for 2008, it offers a few more kid-friendly features and a more powerful V-8, and its reliability of late has improved to respectable levels. Still, if you just like the Commander’s styling but don’t need its abilities, it’s probably best to warm up to something else.\n\nThis is the Jeep Commander’s third year on the market; it comes with rear- or four-wheel drive in Sport, Limited and Overland trim levels. Click here to see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model. A V-6 and two V-8s are offered, and most models seat seven. I tested a four-wheel-drive Jeep Commander Sport with the 4.7-liter V-8, but I’ve driven the other trims in past years.\n\n \n\nGoing & Stopping\nOutput for the V-6 and V-8 engines ranges from 210 to 330 horsepower. All three engines work with a five-speed automatic transmission. Here’s how they compare:\n\nCommander Engines\nEngine\tAvailability\tHorsepower (@ rpm)\tTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\n3.7-liter V-6\tstandard on Sport\t210 @ 5,200\t235 @ 4,000\n4.7-liter V-8\toptional on Sport, standard on Limited\t305 @ 5,650\t334 @ 3,950\n5.7-liter Hemi V-8\toptional on Limited, standard on Overland\t330 @ 5,000\t375 @ 4,000\n\n \n\nThe V-6 is strong enough for most situations, particularly if you drive solo, but it loses some steam on the highway. Last year’s 4.7-liter V-8 delivered appreciably more off-the-line grunt. This year’s version has been tweaked to raise output from 235 hp to 305 hp, and the improvement is noticeable. My test car accelerated easily to highway speeds, with smooth, linear power and a burly exhaust sound well into the upper revs.\n\nI’m not so keen on the automatic transmission. It shifts quite early in most situations, and around town there’s a discernable lag as it moves from gear to gear. I found its highway manners much more agreeable, however, with hassle-free kickdown for easy passing. Even with three passengers and enough gear for a weekend away, there was ample power to accelerate from 60 to 70 mph in fourth gear.\n\nWhen you experience the 4.7-liter engine in such moments, it’s hard to see why anyone would spring for the 5.7-liter Hemi. Though that engine’s high-speed passing power is impressive — and it emits an authoritative rumble when pushed — it doesn’t feel all that much gutsier starting out. Where that extra power might come in handy is easing the transmission’s shifting fussiness, but I haven’t driven that engine back-to-back with the revised 4.7-liter V-8, so be sure to do so if you’re comparing the two.\n\nThanks to its fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation system, the Hemi’s mileage penalty versus the 4.7-liter engine is just 1 mpg in the city. Note that Jeep recommends midgrade fuel for the Hemi, though, while it recommends regular fuel for the other engines.\n\nAll told, the Commander’s mileage is disappointing when compared to its trucklike competitors. (I didn’t compare crossovers and minivans here, but suffice it to say they’re considerably more fuel-efficient.)\n\n \n\nMileage & Towing Compared (4×2 models)\n \tV-6 mileage (recommended gas)\tV-8 mileage (recommended gas)\tMax. towing capacity w/V-8 (lbs.)\nToyota 4Runner\t16/21 (regular)\t15/19 (regular)\t7,300\nNissan Pathfinder\t15/22 (premium)\t13/18 (premium)\t7,000\nFord Explorer\t14/20 (regular)\t13/20 (regular)\t7,310\nJeep Commander\t14/19 (regular)\t4.7-liter: 14/19 (regular); 5.7-liter: 13/19 (midgrade)\t7,400\nSource: EPA, automaker data\n\n \n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal delivers linear response, but it never feels particularly strong. As you might expect, loading up the Commander with people and cargo diminishes its braking performance even more.\n\n \n\nRide & Handling\nThe Commander uses Jeep’s rugged Uniframe architecture — it’s technically a unibody SUV, though the independent front and non-independent rear suspension are more like those of body-on-frame trucks. The underpinnings preserve a comfortable ride: Road and wind noise stay in check on the highway, but the Commander’s poor aerodynamics mean crosswinds can catch drivers off-guard. Serious potholes produce lingering echoes as the suspension bounces around, but the Commander manages to isolate drivers from most of the lighter disruptions.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with an appropriately light touch, stopping short of the lifeless, artificial feeling that can come from too much power assist. Prolonged curves induce plenty of body roll, and the SUV feels especially top-heavy if it’s loaded with people and cargo.\n\nExterior & Offroad Abilities\nThe Commander’s shape made it instantly recognizable as a Jeep when it arrived in early 2005, and it remains fresh today. Jeep says it drew on the long-lived Cherokee for inspiration, and it shows in the Commander’s slab-sided body and boxlike hood. I find the styling fits Jeep’s tough-guy credo much better than the Grand Cherokee or Compass SUVs do, and its continuation in the Patriot and Liberty is probably a good thing.\n\nThe tall stance enables some serious offroad abilities. I won’t delve too much into the hardware, as I suspect hardcore enthusiasts will buy a vehicle tailored just for the trail. But for a seven-seat SUV, the Commander has formidable talent. Three four-wheel-drive systems are available, and all three earn Jeep’s “Trail Rated” designation. The most rugged of them, Quadra-Drive II, has a low-range transfer case and automatically locking front, center and rear differentials. That’s particularly impressive because it allows all four wheels to be powered independently, enabling you to move forward even if three of them are stuck in the mud or up in the air. (A simpler 4×4 system, in contrast, might continue channeling power to a wheel that’s spinning hopelessly.)\n\nThe Inside\nThough the cabin doesn’t raise the bar in any specific area, I found its overall refinement acceptable. Jeep designers went the rugged route: The dashboard’s upper sections have exposed Allen-head screws, there’s no shortage of A/C vents (I counted eight up front), and most surfaces are hard to the touch. Storage areas, too, are abundant. A pocketed shelf sits above the glove compartment, and there are several nooks around the gearshift to stash cell phones or parking stubs. The silver plastic surrounding the center controls and window switches is respectable in quality, but my test car’s all-black interior could have used more of it to lighten things up.\n\nFit and finish is good, with no gaps visible around the radio or steering wheel hub. Upper and lower dash panels are tightly fit, but some controls didn’t get the same attention to detail: The gated shifter stumbles from Park to Drive with sloppy uncertainty, and the stalks for the turn signals and windshield wipers have an unsettling amount of wiggle room.\n\nI found the cloth seats in my test car well-cushioned and durable, and the standard eight-way power driver’s seat has lots of travel. Leather seats and a power passenger seat are optional. One quibble — the hefty steering wheel telescopes but doesn’t tilt very high, so it can get in the way of entry if you have the seat elevated much past its lowest position.\n\nThe stadium-style seats are positioned slightly higher for each successive row, and a stepped ceiling yields nominally more room as you go back, creating excellent headroom and a decent view of the road even from the third row — good news for those prone to carsickness (and anyone charged with cleanup). Unfortunately, legroom isn’t nearly as good; I’m about 6 feet tall, and I found it tight in the second row and untenable in the third.\n\nThe second row folds in a 40/20/40 split, allowing you to create two separate chairs to keep squabbling kids apart. The outboard chairs fold and tumble forward for third-row access, but the opening they leave is tight, and the narrow rear doors make getting back there even harder.\n\nParents will appreciate a few new kid-friendly options this year. Among them are Sirius Satellite TV, which debuted in Chrysler’s redesigned minivans not long ago; it streams mobile content from Nickelodeon, The Disney Channel and Cartoon Network to the Commander’s rear flip-down screen. Chrysler’s MyGIG infotainment system incorporates a hard drive that can store some 1,600 songs — enough that you can leave your iPod at home. A navigation system can be coupled with it, and the system includes real-time traffic monitoring, provided you subscribe to Sirius Satellite Radio, which streams the data in. Although my test car didn’t have the system, I’ve tested it out in the Town & Country; its graphics are first-rate, but the screen’s 6.5-inch size can hamper usability a bit. Many systems have 7- or 8-inch displays.\n\nA third row is optional on the Jeep Commander Sport and standard elsewhere. It stores easily and has tall seatbacks with integrated head restraints, so when the seats are up, visibility out the rear window all but disappears. There’s just 7.5 cubic feet of luggage space behind the seats, which is less than half what you’ll get in a Nissan Pathfinder. Fold all the rear seats down, and the Commander still disappoints: The high cargo floor limits maximum cargo room behind the first row to 68.5 cubic feet. That’s a bit short of other trucklike SUVs and far behind most comparable crossovers.\n\nRoominess Compared\n \tCargo area behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)*\tCargo area behind 1st row (cu. ft.)*\nNissan Pathfinder\t16.5\t79.2\nFord Explorer\t13.6\t83.7\nToyota 4Runner\t12.1\t72.4 — 75.1**\nJeep Commander\t7.5\t68.5\n*Models with three rows of seats.\n**72.4 with double-decker cargo system; 75.1 without.\nSource: EPA, automaker data\n\n \n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Commander has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety features include side curtain airbags for all three rows, with tip sensors so they’ll deploy during a rollover. An electronic stability system, traction control and four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are also standard. The stability system uses Chrysler’s Electronic Roll Mitigation, which attempts to intuit an imminent rollover and trigger preventative braking measures. ERM doesn’t detect when a rollover is occurring, as Ford’s Roll Stability Control does.\n\nThe second row comes with Latch child-seat anchors for all three positions; most cars have specific provisions for the outboard seats only. Top-tether anchors for the outboard positions are conveniently located midway down the backside of the seats, but the anchor for the middle seat — the safest spot for kids — is in the more traditional (and harder to reach) location at the base of the seatback.\n\nFollowing a poor start in 2006, the Commander’s reliability is on the upswing. Consumer Reports gave the 2007 Jeep Commander V-8 Above-Average marks for reliability (the V-6 model was not rated; it scored Average in 2006). The publication predicts overall reliability of Average for new Commanders.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout Jeep’s $730 destination charge, a two-wheel-drive Commander Sport starts at $27,415. Standard features include the V-6 engine, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, 17-inch alloy wheels and ultrasonic rear parking sensors. The Limited ($36,305) includes the 4.7-liter V-8, a power passenger seat, heated leather upholstery and a moonroof, while the Overland ($39,485) comes loaded with the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, a backup camera, a navigation system and more. Adding four-wheel-drive costs anywhere from $2,000 to $3,645, depending on the type of system added, and lower trims can option up to the next engine choice.\n\nExpect a fully loaded, four-wheel-drive Commander Overland to cost around $45,000.\n\nCommander in the Market\nGraded against a narrow class of competitors, the Jeep Commander seems like a solid choice. Its offroad prowess is a force to be reckoned with, it tows a stout 7,400 pounds and it can be packed with plenty of family-friendly gadgets. If that’s exactly what you’re looking for, look no further.\n\nI suspect most shoppers are open to alternatives within the general SUV field, though, and here’s where a crossover would win out. They’re more space- and fuel-efficient, and most handle with carlike grace. The hype is true, folks: If you possibly can, consider one of those before you buy one of these.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "In the cheap muck that defines many Chrysler interiors – the dull, flimsy plastics, the ’80s-inspired rectangular cutouts and build quality – Jeep has kept its head above the goo.\n\nClimb into a Commander, a Grand Cherokee platform with an identical wheelbase but lengthened 1.8 inches and widened 0.6 inches in track, and you’re treated to Land Rover luxury without the Land Rover brittle plastics.\n\nBurl wood trim surrounds the attractive center stack on our top-level $48,210 Overland, which also includes two-tone leather and microfiber seats (also known as Alcantara). Allen-head screws are at all corners, and the squarish, upright presentation matches the Commander’s instantly recognizable brick exterior.\n\nYou can tell on the outside – from the chrome 18-inch wheels, xenon headlamps, and D-pillar grab handles – that this is a luxury Jeep. You can’t tell it’s from the same people who make the Dodge Durango.\n\nThe driving experience is just as luxurious, far above the smaller Land Rover LR2 HSE which costs almost as much. Considering its non-aero proportions, the Commander exhibits Lexus-like levels of wind noise on the highway, and runs with a library hush around town. The 5.7 liter Hemi V-8 has gobs of torque – and its sound prompts you to open all the windows to take it in – but it’s very, very thirsty, as expected from a vehicle weighing 5,239 pounds (more than a Hummer H3T). The window sticker lists an EPA estimated 13 miles per gallon in the city, and that’s dead-on accurate. Don’t drive the Commander in the city like I did. The fuel gauge drops almost as fast as the temperature needle rises from cold.\n\nThe suspension is plush with a fair amount of dive and pitch under cornering and braking. While the Commander stays cool under normal driving, remember that this is a big, body-on-frame truck, and you’d best treat it like one. This is also a serious four-wheel-drive SUV, though certainly not as adventurous as a Wrangler, despite all the skid plates shielding the fuel tank, front suspension, and transfer case. There’s a low-range button near the shifter, but everything else is automatic, including the operation of the limited-slip differentials.\n\nThe rest of the goodies exist to coddle and comfort: heated front and rear seats, a backseat multimedia center with a flip-down LCD screen, backseat “skylights,” power adjustable pedals, tri-zone climate control, Bluetooth, Sirius radio, auto highbeams, rain-sensing wipers, and auto-dim mirrors. At this price point, you’re still $10,000 away from a Range Rover Sport, which delivers the same terrible gas mileage but with no backseat entertainment and poor company reliability ratings.\n\nHas Jeep one-upped the British SUV experience? If having “RANGE ROVER” on the front of your vehicle is important, the answer is no. But for shoppers who still crave large luxury SUVs and want value (not to mention a cramped but usable third-row seat), the Commander is the one.",

      "expert_review": "The 2007 Jeep Commander’s interior is roomy, handsome and well-designed. The SUV’s 3rd-row seat is fine for kids but marginal for adults.\n\nIt does not seem that long ago that Jeep had only three models — the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and Liberty.\n\nIn fact, it wasn’t that long ago. Just 2005. Now, we have the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and Liberty, plus the Compass, Patriot and Commander. And really, the four-door Wrangler Unlimited is different enough from the regular Wrangler that it could almost be considered the seventh model.\n\nSome would argue that Jeep has gone from having too few models to too many. But that’s Jeep’s problem — and the problem of Jeep dealers trying to move them off the lot.\n\nOne of those not moving too quickly is the Commander. Currently there’s a $3,500 rebate on the 2007 model.\n\nThis is the second model year for the Commander. Back in 2006, Jeep had nothing in its lineup bigger than the Grand Cherokee. The company was convinced it was losing sales to competitors who made SUVs with three rows of seats. So Jeep introduced the Commander, with styling that resembles the old Cherokee.\n\nChanges for 2007 are modest, and that’s fine, because Jeep got the Commander pretty much right the first time around. Big, but not Chevrolet Suburban big, the Commander is about 2 inches longer and 4 inches taller than the Grand Cherokee, which shares a platform with the Commander.\n\nStill, that’s enough room for that third-row seat, which really is the whole point of the Commander. That third row is fine for kids, pretty marginal for adults. Otherwise, no complaints about the Commander interior: It’s roomy, handsome and thoughtfully designed.\n\nThree engines are offered: The smallest is a 3.7-liter, 210-horsepower V-6, and the largest is a 5.7-liter, 330-horsepower Hemi V-8. The middle engine, a 4.7-liter, 235-horsepower V-8, was in the test Commander. This engine will run on ethanol, if you can find an ethanol pump. Transmission is a five-speed automatic.\n\nCommanders have rear-wheel drive as standard, but this being a Jeep, four-wheel drive is offered. In fact, there are three four-wheel-drive systems: The simplest, and cheapest, is the basic Quadra-Trac I, which is mostly for on-road use. Quadra-Trac II, which the test Commander had, is more sophisticated and has low-range gearing for off-roading. Quadra-Drive II is the most sophisticated, using lots of electronic aids to maximize traction.\n\nThe test Commander was a Sport, which is the least expensive of the three models, the other two being the Limited and the luxurious Overland. Even so, our Sport started at $29,915, and with options that include a navigation system, a backup camera, a power sunroof with two rear nonopening “skylights,” a premium stereo and leather upholstery, the list price was $38,925.\n\nI liked the Commander from the start, and the styling has grown on me — in certain colors, white and black in particular, I think it’s downright handsome. Road manners have never been a problem: The Commander is capable off-road, and on-pavement ride and handling are excellent.\n\nBut the Commander is a late arrival to an already-crowded field. At its base-price level, the Commander — still offering plenty of standard equipment — is a very good buy, but the more deluxe it gets, the better the competition looks. After all, the $3,500 rebate applies to the $29,915 model, as well as to the $45,015 Overland, but it makes more of an impression at the lower end of the lineup.\n\nOf course, if the Commander doesn’t appeal, Jeep has other products that might. Suddenly, a lot of them.",
