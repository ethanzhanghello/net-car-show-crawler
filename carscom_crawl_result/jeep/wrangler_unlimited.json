      "expert_review": "If there was any doubt a four-door Jeep Wrangler makes sense, you need only look at the numbers.\n\nAfter selling Wrangler with just two doors for decades, Jeep added a four-door for the 2007 model year. Sales of the SUV icon now run 60 percent four-door.\n\nThe adventuresome want to go anywhere, any time, with everyone. That was possible with the two-door but not without a squeeze to get into and out of the equally minuscule rear seat. Space and easier access were sorely needed.\n\nEnter the Unlimited.\n\nUnlimited is offered with a softtop standard and a removable hardtop, a $1,585 option, making it a four-door convertible SUV with adult seating front and rear. And it’s a blast to pilot in fair weather or foul. Wrangler looks like it was created for adventure and shares its go-anywhere, any-time attitude with those who drive it.\n\nIt was created by stretching the two-door 20 inches, wheelbase and length, to add the doors and space to accommodate butts and legs in back.\n\nWe tested the 2009 Wrangler Unlimited with four-wheel-drive and removable hardtop in Sahara trim.\n\nIts rugged good looks sport the signature Jeep round headlamps and seven-slot grille.\n\nHinges, bolts and fasteners are exposed to add to the only-in-a-Jeep mystique. But you have to provide the splatters of mud.\n\nNot only is the hardtop removable, but so are the doors. How much more free-spirited can you get? Windows in all doors lower completely, and rear doors open 90 degrees to ease entry/exit.\n\nEven with adults in back, cargo room is ample for gear or groceries. Without passengers, the split rear seats, and headrests, fold to hold even more.\n\nThe 4WD transfer case isn’t as smooth in going from two- to four-wheel-drive or 4WD low as a dial-up system, but once in 4WD, Wrangler is at its best-on pavement or field. A few 4WD runs cleared a path to the mailbox for the postal truck.\n\nSeats are well padded to minimize bouncing and beating off-road, but on clear pavement the suspension tends to impersonate a buckboard. The body leans a little in corners, a lean that’s exaggerated at speed.\n\nWrangler offers only a 3.8-liter, 205-horsepower V-6. It’s no screamer, which is just as well because so much road noise filters into the thinly insulated cabin, it’s hard to hear the engine rev, much less the passenger shout or radio blare.\n\nRated at 15 m.p.g. city/19 m.p.g. highway, the V-6 begs the question, where’s a high-mileage 4?\n\nDespite uncertain gas prices, Wrangler has none and no plans to add one.\n\nChrysler created a Wrangler Unlimited EV, an extended-range hybrid that can go 40 miles on its lithium-ion battery pack before recharging. Need to keep driving after those 40? A small gas engine burns about 8 gallons to power a generator to produce electricity for 400 more miles.\n\nIn addition to the Unlimited EV, Chrysler has a Jeep Patriot, Dodge minivan and Chrysler 200C sedan with the same 40/400-mile range. Then there’s a battery-only Dodge Circuit sports car with a 150-200 mile range before recharging.\n\nCircuit and 200C are concepts; Wrangler, the minivan and Patriot prototypes. One will be built for North America in 2010, three others in 2013. No date for the fifth. Chrysler won’t divulge the order, but it does say the hybrid ends the need for a 4-cylinder gas Wrangler.\n\nBut we digress. The Unlimited’s cabin is built for simplicity with big, easy-to-see, reach and use controls to adjust climate and audio systems along with power windows/mirrors. Missing are the dozens of buttons that tell the weather next week or the number of road barricades a mile ahead.\n\nThe Wrangler tested starts at $28,320 with traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes, trailer-sway control that activates stability control to keep what’s being towed in line, Hill Start Assist to prevent rollback on inclines, air conditioning, AM/FM/CD/MP3 capable audio system, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, stain-free seat fabric, temperature gauge and compass, floor mats, fog lamps, tow hooks, satellite radio, 18-inch aluminum wheels and tubular side steps.\n\nOne option worth considering is remote start ($185) to warm the SUV up outside while you warm up inside.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "After years of waiting, spy photos galore, leaked documents and owners manuals appearing online, Jeep has finally lifted the veil on the all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler. This is the \"JL\" in Wrangler-speak, as opposed to the previous \"JK\" version.\n\n\nThe new Wrangler will be arriving in dealerships in a matter of weeks, but beware: While Jeep is labeling this a 2018 model, they'll still be selling the old JK model alongside it — also as a 2018.\n\n\nLike before, there's a two-door version and the Unlimited four-door version. Like before, the top and doors are all removable, and the windshield folds flat against the hood. But while the Wrangler may look the same, Jeep has gone over every system in the thing with an eye toward addressing customer concerns.\n\nExterior\nFrom the outside, the changes from JK to JL Wrangler are subtle, indeed. It’s slightly longer and the hood is more level, as well. The grille is slightly reshaped, and the Jeep logo has been moved from the grille to the side of the front fenders — “Where God intended it to be,” according to Jeep Chief Designer Mark Allen.\n\nLED headlights are optional, as are LED taillights. The fenders are higher and reshaped, and can accommodate a 33-inch tire without any modification (or a 35-inch tire with a 2-inch lift kit). There’s more window glass, as well, and the rake of the windshield is slightly greater.\n\nAlong the side, the doors still have exposed external hinges, but the doors themselves now open on struts and no longer swing free. But don’t fret: Removing the doors is only slightly more complicated, with the user now needing to unbolt the strut as well as the two hinge pins. Lifting the doors off should be easier, too — they’re aluminum and weigh considerably less than the outgoing model’s doors, and the interior of the door panel is designed to allow someone to easily grip and carry the doors around.\n\nThe windshield folds flat by simply unscrewing four bolts at the top of the windshield panel. The rearview mirror and sun visors are now mounted to the Wrangler’s frame, meaning they stay in place when you lower the windshield. It takes 28 bolts and an hour to drop the windshield on a JK Wrangler. The new design is a massive improvement — just make sure you bring some goggles or big sunglasses to avoid debris in your eyes while in motion.\n\nOut back, the tailgate and rear window are wider, and the windshield wiper on the hardtop is now integrated into the lower part of the tailgate instead of on the window itself, improving rear visibility. But perhaps the biggest exterior difference is one that’s going to make a serious change in how people use their Wrangler.\n\nThe tops are all new, totally redesigned — and none of them use zippers. There are three tops available: the standard Freedom Top hardtop, which no longer uses those difficult-to-twist manual fastener screws; a full Sunrider soft top (available in black or tan); and a new Sky One-Touch power top that features a panoramic roll-back top and removable rigid side panels.\n\nUnlike the soft top and Freedom Top, the Sky One-Touch power top is not meant to be completely removable without a lot of work and several tools. But that’s OK; you can still get the totally topless experience with either of the other two tops. The soft top uses a system of sliding rubber tracks and gaskets instead of zippers, eliminating one of the biggest obstacles owners face in raising or lowering a top quickly.\n\nInterior\nThe Wrangler’s cabin gets a full redo, as well, with better sightlines and more attention to comfort. A new horizontal instrument panel is up front, and it takes inspiration from the round dials of the CJ-5 and the long row of gauges on the YJ. Front seats are still in the same position, but visibility is improved thanks to taller glass all around.\n\nMany of the instrument panel’s surfaces are rubberized now, especially the touch points around the stereo. Grab handles have moved from the dash to the A-pillars, and new premium trim options bring leather wrapping to the dash for the first time. The door panels also get some attention, with longer armrests for improved comfort. The center locking console is also 50 percent bigger and contains a USB port.\n\nBackseat comfort is addressed with 1.1 inches more rear legroom in the Unlimited, a benefit of the new JL’s longer wheelbase. Seatback recline has also been improved, while two USB ports and climate-control vents keep passengers mollified. A new cupholder armrest has also been added to the Unlimited’s backseat. In the two-door Wrangler, the backseat features integrated head restraints now that fold down for stowage and better rear visibility when not in use.\n\nThe interior electronics have gotten a complete overhaul, as well. Three multimedia-screen options are available: a 5.0-, 7.0- or 8.4-inch touchscreen that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a pinch-to-zoom feature. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ latest Uconnect adorns the dash, complete with the Off Road Pages function that has previously been seen on other Jeep models.\n\nA new gauge cluster features an optional 7-inch reconfigurable digital display, including a dedicated transfer-case display to tell you what mode you’re in. A new feature for 2018: Four optional auxiliary switches can be had low on the center console, programmable buttons that can be used to wire up accessories like a winch, external lights or a CB radio quickly and easily, and without the need to drill into the vehicle’s panels.\n\nUnder the Hood\nPowering the Wrangler is a familiar motor — the 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 carries over unchanged, still making 285 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. It’s joined by a new premium option, however, in a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that Jeep has adapted for use from an Alfa Romeo program. It makes 270 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, and it’s technically a mild hybrid system in that it uses a small electric motor to engage stop-start and add a little initial torque to the system when you start moving.\n\nA 3.0-liter turbo-diesel engine is coming for the Unlimited model only, making 260 hp and a whopping 442 pounds-feet of torque, but it won’t arrive until the 2019 model year. The V-6 is mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission or a new eight-speed automatic, while the turbo four-cylinder and diesel are automatic only.\n\nTwo four-wheel-drive systems are offered: the standard part-time 4×4 that current Wrangler owners enjoy, or a new full-time all-wheel-drive system available only on the Sahara trim level (only Sport, Sport S, Sahara and Rubicon models will be available at first, with the two-door only getting Sport, Sport S and Rubicon).\n\nIt will behave like a traditional “set-it-and-forget-it” all-wheel-drive system, transferring torque to wheels that need it most. The crawl ratio has been improved in low range, as well, now looking at an 84.2:1 ratio for a Rubicon with a manual transmission and 77.2:1 for automatic-equipped Rubicons. The standard axles will be the next-generation Dana units, while the Rubicon gets beefier heavy-duty Dana 44 axles with electronic locking front and rear differentials, as before.\n\nThe chassis and structure have been updated significantly, partly for weight savings, partly for aerodynamics and efficiency. In addition to the aforementioned aluminum doors, the tailgate is also now a combination of aluminum outer skin with magnesium inner. Between the frame optimization and new lightweight materials, the Wrangler has dropped about 200 pounds, according to Jeep. Tow ratings remain 3,500 pounds maximum for the four-door and 2,000 pounds for the two-door.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler has always been a bit of a throwback, and this isn’t changing too much with the new model. You only get four airbags (side-impact front-seat airbags are now standard), with no overhead bags. A host of new safety features are available however, including optional blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic detection and a standard backup camera with dynamic guide lines. Forward emergency braking will become available later in the model year, according to Jeep.",

      "expert_review": "I’ve long thought that if a car enthusiast fell into a coma, say, 60 years ago and just awoke, he or she might recognize only two vehicles: The Porsche 911, and the Jeep Wrangler. Sure, both those models have undergone extensive and dramatic updates, but they still retain the general appearance, and certainly serve the same audience, as they have for decades.\n\nThe original Jeep evolved into the CJ-5, then the longer CJ-7, then became the Wrangler. In 2004, Jeep made one of the biggest changes in the vehicle’s history – it added a lengthened four-door model called the Unlimited. Jeeps have long be available with a rear seat, but some gymnastics were required to climb back there, and riding in the back wasn’t much better than walking. With the Unlimited, no one would confuse the rear-seat accomodations with a luxury car, but it’s comfortable for two adults, passable for three.\n\nJeep still, of course, offers the regular Wrangler, at a starting price of just over $22,000, or $23,885 with air conditioning, Sirius satellite radio and shipping. The Wrangler Unlimited starts at $25,545, and the price rises quickly as options are added. The test Unlimited was the Saraha model, which started at $29,945, and ended up at $35,305 with shipping and options that ranged from a touch-screen navigation system to remote starting.\n\nAbout that remote starting: To crank the engine, press the top button on the key fob twice. For plenty of vehicles, this top spot is the lock-unlock button, and walking away from the Wrangler Unlimited in the dark, I accidentally started it. It only happened once, but I’d still prefer the remote start feature be a little more difficult to engage.\n\nEven at over $35,000, our Sahara isn’t the most expensive Wrangler Unlimited – that would be the Rubicon model, which has a few more sophisticated off-road components than the other models. Unless you are a dedicated off-roader, you won’t care. The test Sahara, with its old-school but dependable manual four-wheel-drive, high-low activation, is as good as anything you can buy off-road. Well, not quite as good as a regular Wrangler; the Unlimited is more than 20 inches longer, so it isn’t as nimble on tight, winding trails.\n\nThat extra length and weight – about 300 pounds’ worth – makes a huge and very positive difference on the road. The regular Wrangler’s ride is abrupt and choppy on rough roads, but the Unlimited smooths out the pavement and makes genuine long-distance travel effortless. There’s also a generaous 43 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, compared to 17.5 cubic feet for the regular Wrangler. Handling on the highway is quite good, due in part to the big 18-inch Bridgestone radials mounted on handsome five-spoke alloy wheels.\n\nInside, the Unlimited gets a handsome, and long overdue, interior redesign for 2011. It’s still traditional and functional, but it’s much more accommodating. The test Sahara had the complex, multi-part removable hardtop, which, when in place, makes the ride quiet and cool – soft tops do little to keep sound out, and air-conditioned air in. But plenty of dedicated Jeepsters want the open-air option, and for them, the soft top makes more sense, and it’s cheaper. Even with the hardtop, though, there’s some road noise from the tires, and some wind noise. Jeep engineers are proud to point out the Wrangler’s aerodynamic improvements, but let’s face it: With that grille and upright windshield, aerodynamices are closer to a cracker box than a Dodge Viper.\n\nAll Wranglers have the capable but unremarkable 3.8-liter, 202-horsepower V-6 under the hood, with your choice of a six-speed manual or, as in the test Sahara, a four-speed automatic transmission, which adds a bargain $825 to the price. Regardless of the model or the transmission, all Wranglers are EPA-rated at 15 mpg city, 19 mpg highway on regular gas. The V-6 engine is a little noisy but adequate, and the four-speed automatic transmission works hard to maximize its power. Still, another gear would be nice – almost all vehicles have at least a five-speed automatic.\n\nThe test Sahara, painted an appropriate “Sahara tan,” was one of the best-looking Jeeps I’ve seen, inside and out. It isn’t cheap, but Jeeps have stellar resale value. Like all Jeep Wranglers before it, the Unlimited Sahara has personality, but it’s a pleasant one I could live with every day.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com.\n\n2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited\n\nBase price: $25,545\n\nPrice as tested: $35,305\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter, 202-horsepower V-6\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nEPA rating: 15 miles per gallon city driving, 19 mpg highway\n\nLength: 173.4 inches\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches\n\nIn a nutshell: Jeep brings the Wrangler into the, um, 20th century.",

      "expert_review": "I have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nRecent upgrades make the 2013 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hardtop is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions, the fender flares and removable hardtop are body-colored.\n\nChanges for 2013 include redesigned seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, new wheel designs for Rubicon and Sahara trim levels, an optional Alpine premium stereo and a new optional premium soft-top that has nicer material than the regular top and three layers for better noise isolation (or when it’s too hot and you just need air conditioning). See the 2012 and 2013 models compared here.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Wrangler comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 engine and five-speed automatic transmission that replaced a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and four-speed in the 2012 model year. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: more power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nThe rough, old 3.8-liter V-6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe current Wrangler hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me.\n\nThe Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus off-road capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (as on the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Wrangler illustrates the trade-offs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the Unlimited Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader trade-off, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 21 competitors.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser, are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nOverall, we found the Wrangler Unlimited accommodates three different types of child-safety seats well. See the Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages …\n\nI’ll buy a Jeep Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: A new 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 engine with 260 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque available on four-door models; new special edition trims, including the return of the Willys trim; LED headlights and foglights now available on the Sport trim level; optional Advanced Safety Group package now adds automatic high-beam headlights when also opting for the 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia display with built-in navigation\n\nPrice change: $250 more for both two- and four-door Sport versions, plus four-door versions of the Sport S, Sport Altitude, Sahara and Sahara Altitude; $445 more for two-door Sport S models; and $580 more for two- and four-door versions of the Rubicon.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? For a greater variety of choices, you’ll have to opt for a 2020. But if you’re sticking to a carryover trim, particular the pricey Rubicon, try for a 2019.\n\nJeep updated its venerable Wrangler for 2020 with multiple new trim levels, including the return of the Willys trim from the previous-generation JK Wrangler. Other new trim levels include the Willys Sport, Black & Tan, Freedom and North Edition. A high-end High Altitude trim debuted at the 2020 Chicago Auto Show as a 2020 model — as did a Jeep Performance Parts edition — but neither is available as of this writing. The Moab trim level has been discontinued for 2020.\n\nRelated: 2020 Jeep Wrangler: Everything You Need to Know\n\nThe new EcoDiesel engine is a $4,000 option (but also requires the $2,000 automatic transmission, so opting for one ups the price by $6,000). It improves the Wrangler’s efficiency from bad to middling, with a combined mpg rating of 25, up from 19-20 mpg for the V-6 or 21-23 mpg for the four-cylinder. It also doesn’t negatively impact the Wrangler’s off-road performance, thankfully, with a powertrain that can handle the added weight and throttle responsiveness that rivals a gasoline powertrain.\n\nBesides the trim levels and the diesel engine, the remaining updates are minor, with upgraded LED head- and foglights available on the Sport trim and automatic high beams included with the Advanced Safety Group option package when combined with the optional 8.4-inch Uconnect multimedia system with built-in navigation.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel Review: Efficiency You Can Feel (and Hear)\n2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel: 7 Pros and 4 Cons\nJeep Wrangler JPP 20: Accessories Included\n2020 Jeep Wrangler, Gladiator High Altitude: From Off-Road to On-Fleek\n2020 Most Fun-to-Drive Car of the Year\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nA new drivetrain and recent upgrades make the 2012 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hard top is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions, the fender flares and removable hard top are body-colored.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Wrangler now comes with a new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, replacing a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6. Like the engine, the five-speed automatic comes from the Grand Cherokee, replacing the 2011’s four-speed. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions. See the two model years compared.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: More power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nJeep Wrangler Mileage\n(EPA-estimated city/highway – combined)\n \tManual\tAutomatic\n2011 Wrangler and\nWrangler Unlimited\t15/19 – 16\t15/19 – 17\n2012 Wrangler\t17/21 – 18\t17/21 – 18\n2012 Wrangler Unlimited\t16/21 – 18\t16/20 – 18\n\nThe rough old 3.8-liter V-6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher, at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe regular Wrangler now hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me … .\n\nThe Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus offroad capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (see the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Wrangler illustrates the tradeoffs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the Unlimited Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader tradeoff, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 24 competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages … .\n\nI’ll buy a Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "As parents we mark milestones that show our kids are growing (not fast enough some days and way too fast on others). Just like some people mark their kid’s height on a wall or doorjamb, a MotherProof.com reviewer’s kids grow in and out of cars. Case in point: the 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara. I reviewed the 2007 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, which has four doors, and found it difficult for a mom with younger kids to manage. Back then, I had wished that my kids were older so I could embrace that SUV, and like a parent who couldn’t wait for that first day of kindergarten, that day is here. And here I am, wishing I owned a 2010 Wrangler Unlimited because it was so much fun for my whole family.\n\nMy test car, the Wrangler Unlimited Sahara, had a V-6 engine that was plenty powerful, if not peppy. This Jeep isn’t made for massive acceleration on the highway; where it really shines is off-road. It also performs well with city driving. If you’re a serious off-roader you’ll want to skip the four-door Wrangler Unlimited and go for the two-door Wrangler.\n\nThe base model, the Wrangler Unlimited Sport, starts at $23,410. The Sahara trim level starts at $28,905, but my test car cost $37,080. The $8,175 price difference comes from a variety of options packages. I liked my test car’s Mopar Chrome Edition package ($1,035), which added a chrome exhaust tip, fuel filler door, taillamp guards and side steps. This added a little flash to this usually quiet vehicle. In addition to all the bling, there was yet another chrome package that added a chrome grille and side mirrors. That was another $485.\n \nEXTERIOR\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is definitely a fun vehicle to look at, and I like to think that other people wished they had as fun a car as I did. Well, for a week anyway. This SUV has a distinctive look, with squared-off edges, and I loved the Rescue Green Metallic paint of my test SUV. It was bright and fun without being overly trendy or weird.\n\nHowever, the Wrangler Unlimited isn’t the easiest SUV to live with because it takes effort to make it work well. The doors don’t prop open because they’re only held on to the body with nylon straps, so watch where you park this SUV if your kids like to throw car doors open.\n\nIt’s also hard for shorter ones to climb in with ease. Yes, my Wrangler Unlimited had the standard tubular side steps, aka running boards, but let’s face it, the Jeep is made to have some serious ground clearance of at least 10.2 inches. Three-year-olds will struggle to get in this SUV. My kids, who are 6 and 8, actually had the hardest time pushing the button on the outside door handle. Once they mastered it, they liked everything about the Wrangler Unlimited.\n\nIt was so good that the kids never complained one iota about going anywhere. They hopped in as soon as I asked them to and were excited to go. That’s worth something, isn’t it?\n\nOne more thing that contributed to their vehicular bliss was the Wrangler Unlimited’s Freedom Top. The Freedom Top is a set of three roof panels that you can remove to bring the outside in. There are two panels over the front seat and one large panel over the back seat and cargo area. I liked the versatility of the panels; they let in more light and air than a sunroof but didn’t take too long to remove or replace when the elements got too crazy. This feature helped the Jeep shine as a premier fun machine.\n\nIn addition to the Freedom Top, my test Jeep came with a soft-top, which was redesigned for the 2010 model year and supposedly easier to remove than before. I didn’t remove the soft-top because I didn’t have a Torx wrench.\n\nIn addition to the removable roof, the doors are also removable, and the windshield can be folded down. While I didn’t get to removing and folding, I did note that it would be easy to do. It’s pretty amazing how versatile the Jeep is, and I wish I’d had it for a longer test to completely transform it.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited has a 205-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine. A six-speed manual is standard. My test SUV had the available four-speed automatic ($825). The Wrangler Unlimited takes regular gas and gets 15/19 mpg city/highway with either transmission.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great (for older kids)\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is rugged, with an extra side of rugged, and its interior is sturdy and can take a beating. If you can’t get those Freedom Top panels on in time to beat the rain, a little won’t hurt the interior. Likewise, melted chocolate and spilled drinks wiped off with ease. Not that I actually experienced this – ahem – I’m just saying that if somebody happened to make a mess in the Jeep, there’d be few worries.\n\nThe seating is stiff, but I didn’t mind them because this is a Jeep and should feel like it’s rough and tough. Besides, I got so distracted by the fun drive and the amazing sound system blasting my favorite tunes that I didn’t pay much attention to the seats. However, over the course of my test week I could see how a person might tire of them.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited has some lockable storage, which would be handy when the soft-top has been removed. The center console locks and you can get a couple items in there like a wallet, a cell phone or whatever. If you’re carrying a lot of valuables I recommend you leave the doors and the soft-top on.\n\nAs for other interior amenities, this SUV has two front cupholders and two rear cupholders that sit on the floor on the back of the center console. This location wasn’t a big deal for my big kids, but smaller kids could become bummed out when they can’t reach them.\n\nYou also might be bummed out at the cargo space in the Wrangler Unlimited. You’ll have to be conscientious of what you put back there. Don’t be surprised if you have to pare down a little. There’s a 60/40-split folding backseat if you need some extra cargo room.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. The outer Latch anchors were easy to use, but the inner anchors in both positions sat right behind the seat belt buckles, which made them difficult to use.\n\nThe good news for me was my kids’ booster seats fit safely and securely in the backseat. For those of you with younger kids, beware. The rear seats are angled, making convertible child-safety seats tricky to fit properly because as the bench is narrow and the fixed rear head restraints don’t accommodate the back of the convertible seat very well. A rear-facing infant seat was a tight fit.\n\nJeep has made all kinds of safety features standard in the 2010 Wrangler Unlimited, but there are some features that are not. For example, it has standard front airbags, but side-impact airbags for the front row are optional ($490). Side curtain airbags are not available in the Jeep, which is not surprising when you consider that the Wrangler Unlimited’s top is removable.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited’s standard safety features include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, all-speed traction control and electronic stability control with rollover mitigation technology that pulses individual brakes to prevent impending rollovers.\n\nIt should be noted that in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Wrangler Unlimited received a Marginal score in side-impact and rear crash protection tests. Vehicles are scored using a Good, Acceptable, Marginal and Poor grading system. The Wrangler Unlimited scored Good in the frontal-offset tests. The SUV hasn’t been tested using the agency’s new roof-strength tests. As a mom, these scores give me pause. You’ll have to decide for yourself if the fun factor outweighs the crash-test results.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara here.",

      "expert_review": "There’s really nothing quite like a Jeep Wrangler. That’s not an exaggerated claim, either; it’s the only body-on-frame SUV on the market with two live axles and doors that not only come off, they’re easily removable. We’re about to see an all-new Wrangler introduced for 2018, so we figured one last hurrah in the outgoing model was warranted.\n\nWe drove the top-of-the-line 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock. Loaded with every conceivable piece of off-road equipment on the options list, it is utterly unlike anything on the market. But while its off-road abilities are well-established, what is it like to live with every day? Lots of people buy a Wrangler for its looks and image alone, but does it make a decent daily driver?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler looks as the Jeep Wrangler has for decades. Take a look at an original 1941 Willys and you can immediately see the lineage. It’s a shape and design philosophy as old and revered as the Porsche 911, Volkswagen Beetle or Ford Mustang. While it has varied some over the years (including a brief stint with square headlights in the 1980s), the chunky, blocky, purposeful styling has stayed much the same.\n\nSo has the body’s functionality. All four doors are completely removable via just two bolts and a fabric door-check strap. The hardtop comes off with a few more bolts and a friend to help you lift it. If you want only a little bit of sun, the Freedom Top front panels can be removed separately, or you can opt for the finicky manual soft-top for alfresco motoring whenever the mood strikes. It’s not the easiest soft-top to put up and down, requiring the removal of side panels and the rear window, but owners put up with such hassles in exchange for an open-air sensation like no other.\n\nThe Hard Rock package adds some visual flair, too, with a custom leather interior and special hood, bumpers, wheels, badges and some top content as well, like an Alpine premium audio system and heated front seats.\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of the Jeep Wrangler’s styling: If you don’t like it, you can change it. Myriad aftermarket companies offer everything from fenders to bumpers to auxiliary lights. All it takes is money.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nJudging how the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited drives depends entirely on where you’re driving it. Take it to your local off-road park, through the California desert, over towering coastal sand dunes or through a forest full of mud holes and two-track ravines, and it’s brilliant.\n\nThe list of parts that help the Jeep Wrangler go anywhere unpaved is long: There’s part-time four-wheel drive with a 4:1 creeper gear; a 4.10 final drive ratio; electronically lockable front and rear differentials on heavy-duty Dana 44 solid axles; beefy off-road shocks and springs; skid plates protecting various underbody components; electronically disconnecting front sway bar links; super-chunky BFGoodrich M/T Mud-Terrain tires; and 10.5 inches of ground clearance. It soldiers along broken, boulder-strewn, rutted dirt hard-pack trails like a champ, soaking up terrain that would set your teeth rattling and kidneys bruising in just about any other vehicle. It’s made to be off-road, and that’s where it excels like no other.\n\nGet back on the street, however, and you’ll be singing an altogether different tune. The engine — a 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 — is the only one offered, mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic. Many enthusiasts get excited when they see that a manual is still available, but they shouldn’t be; it’s awful, with a rubbery feel and a shift lever so long you’ll feel like you’re shifting an oar. The automatic works much better for everyday driving on- or off-road, but you’d never call the Wrangler quick. It’s geared for off-road torque, not brisk acceleration or highway cruising comfort.\n\nOn the street it’s poky and ponderous, and the Rubicon suspension that was so amazing in the rough is soft and marshmallowy on tarmac. Accelerate, and the truck squats on the back wheels thanks to the soft off-road shocks. Hit the brakes, and the nose dips noticeably. Crosswinds are a nightmare on the highway (or even around town) because of the Wrangler’s slab sides and tall off-road tires. The soft brakes don’t work with any sense of immediacy, either. Simply put, the Wrangler makes an awful daily driver, family vehicle or first-time ride for a teenage driver.\n\nThe Wrangler’s one true saving grace, however, is enough for hundreds of thousands of buyers every year to overlook all that: You can take the top and doors completely off, immediately turning your car into an open-air beach buggy that provides a sense of freedom unlike anything short of a motorcycle.\n\nFuel economy is terrible, but that’s not unexpected given the Jeep Wrangler has all the aerodynamic efficiency of a single-family bungalow. The automatic-equipped Wrangler is EPA-rated 16/20/18 mpg city/highway/combined. That figure gets 1 mpg better on the highway in the manual version thanks to its extra gear. My 260 miles of mixed driving netted 18.9 mpg combined, so I’d say the ratings are pretty much spot-on. Of course, if you take the top and doors off, what little aerodynamic efficiency the Wrangler has goes right out the window and you might see your mileage drop — but then, the Jeep will be lighter, so maybe it’s a wash.\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s a climb up into the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon’s cabin thanks to its 10.5-inch ground clearance and big tires. Once you’re there, it’s throwback time. The last time the Wrangler got an interior update was in 2011, when it received a curvier, more carlike dashboard, as opposed to the blockier, cheaper one that preceded it. Nothing has changed in the intervening six years, with the switches, controls and materials still reminiscent of Chrysler’s freshly post-bankruptcy days.\n\nThe front seats are decently comfortable but not terribly big or very adjustable by modern standards. The backseat can fit three people in a pinch, but it’s low to the floor, putting passengers in a knees-up position and not giving them much in the way of legroom.\n\nThe beauty of this interior is its customizability. Don’t like the silver trim color? You can replace it with a Mopar colored trim kit, paint the removable bits yourself or go to any number of aftermarket parts sites for all kinds of embellishments. There are seat covers in just about any color you can imagine and varieties of fabrics — there’s even colored leather replacement upholstery. There are dozens of aftermarket tops, replacement tube doors and custom holders for all kinds of accessories, from fire extinguishers to flashlights to coolers. The resources available to make a Wrangler your own are immense, limited only by your imagination and wallet. The only real problem is that the inexpensive standard interior in my test car came in a vehicle costing nearly $50,000. For that much money, it should be decidedly better than it is.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Wrangler’s gauges are small, but they’re easy to read and don’t overload the driver with all kinds of information. In many ways, the Jeep Wrangler’s vintage nature carries through to its electronics — there isn’t much in the way of fancy technology in here, as you wouldn’t really want much in an interior that’s meant to get wet. The Wrangler’s controls are simple and easy to use, with switches that are easy to find, including those that activate the locking axles and sway-bar disconnect.\n\nThe multimedia system itself is positively ancient by Chrysler’s own standards — now that the old minivans have been retired in favor of the new Pacifica, the Jeep Wrangler remains the only vehicle in the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stable that features this style multimedia system, which dates back to the previous decade. Yet while it isn’t the latest Uconnect system, there’s something to be said for its dead-nuts simple operation and design. It’s not flashy, but for audio and multimedia files, it works quite well.\n\nThe optional Alpine premium audio system is a must-have. It’s designed specifically for the Jeep Wrangler’s horrible acoustics and speaker placement, and its more robust speakers, dedicated amp and floor-mounted rear subwoofer make a huge difference. If you opt for the regular stereo, you won’t be able to hear it if you remove the top and doors. The Alpine system knows when you’ve got the top down and adjusts output accordingly.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited features 31.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which fold flat to open up a cavernous 70.6 cubic feet of total cargo room. If you opt for a two-door Wrangler you don’t get nearly as much space. That model features a two-passenger bench in the back that folds forward but not much out of the way. It is removable, however, allowing for 55 cubic feet of total cargo room, but then you’ll have reduced your Jeep Wrangler to a two-seater.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Wrangler Unlimited has not been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in any crash test except a rollover, where it scored three out of five stars, making it one of the last few passenger vehicles on the market rated below four stars. Test results from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety are decidedly mixed: The Jeep Wrangler four-door scored good (out of a possible good, acceptable, fair and poor) for small and moderate overlap front tests, but only marginal for side-impact and head restraint tests. There are no crash avoidance technologies available on the Jeep Wrangler — like forward collision warning or autonomous braking — or even parking sensors, blind spot monitors or a backup camera.\n\nTo top it all off, the Jeep Wrangler’s headlights are abysmal. The incandescent bulbs cast a tragically weak beam and are rated poor by IIHS. Optional LED headlights are available for 2017, but the standard headlights are truly terrible (and one of the first things most new owners swap out for aftermarket units upon purchase).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is an expensive vehicle, especially considering the level of technology and refinement you get. Even base models cost more than you might expect, but they do have one benefit: They hold their resale value better than nearly any other vehicle on the market. Still, a basic 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport starts at $28,690 including destination fee, and it goes up from there. There are often special editions each year and always a unique color or two. The price for my tester, a top-trim Rubicon with the Hard Rock package, began at $37,990 but ended up at an eye-watering $48,120 — and there were still options to be had.\n\nAll competitors have fallen by the wayside over the years as safety regulations and fuel economy requirements have taken all the true off-roaders, well, off the road in the U.S. The Ford Bronco, Nissan Xterra, Toyota FJ Cruiser, Hummer H3, Suzuki Samurai and even the Land Rover Defender have all come to an end while the Jeep Wrangler soldiers on.\n\nThere are still a few competitors that might be comparable, one of which comes from Jeep itself. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk has many of the same abilities as the Wrangler but is wrapped in a much more civilized package. That package is also heavier, lacks a removable top and doors, and isn’t as happy off-road as the Wrangler, relying on electronic systems instead of mechanical force to get the job done. You could also head over to a Toyota dealer to grab one of the last old-style SUVs around, the Toyota 4Runner, which is available in a very capable TRD Pro trim that has a good deal of off-road equipment. Like the Grand Cherokee, the 4Runner offers those abilities in a much more civilized SUV wrapper than you’ll find in the Wrangler. Finally, the least expensive model from the only other all-SUV brand offers some off-road abilities in a much more compact model: The Land Rover Range Rover Evoque goes off-road in the same way the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk does, through electronic traction manipulation. Compare all four here.\n\nIn the end, the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon offers buyers a singularly unique experience. It does only two things well, but it does those things supremely well: go off-road through extremely rough terrain and look incredibly cool just about anywhere it pulls up. Many owners love it despite the driving experience, not because of it.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nRecent upgrades make the 2013 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hardtop is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions, the fender flares and removable hardtop are body-colored.\n\nChanges for 2013 include redesigned seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, new wheel designs for Rubicon and Sahara trim levels, an optional Alpine premium stereo and a new optional premium soft-top that has nicer material than the regular top and three layers for better noise isolation. See the 2012 and 2013 models compared here.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Wrangler comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 engine and five-speed automatic transmission that replaced a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and four-speed in the 2012 model year. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: more power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nThe rough, old 3.8-liter V-6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe current Wrangler hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me.\n\nThe Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus off-road capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (as on the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Wrangler illustrates the trade-offs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the Unlimited Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader trade-off, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 21 competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser, are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nOverall, we found the Wrangler Unlimited accommodates three different types of child-safety seats well. See the Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages …\n\nI’ll buy a Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s wildly popular 4×4. It’s available as a two- or four-door SUV, the latter known as the Wrangler Unlimited. The two-door model has room for four people, while the Unlimited version seats five. \n\nA standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine pairs with a six-speed manual transmission; an eight-speed automatic is available. There’s also an optional 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that delivers 295 pounds-feet of torque; it pairs with the eight-speed automatic. A turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 that works with an eight-speed automatic is also available for the Wrangler Unlimited. Finally, a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that makes 375 hp and offers around 25 miles of all-electric range is new for 2021. \n\nFour-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for serious off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Land Rover Defender, Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nJeep has broadened the Wrangler’s powertrain lineup with a newly available plug-in hybrid drivetrain, found in the 4xe model. Featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, two electric motors, a 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack and an eight-speed automatic transmission, Jeep says the Wrangler 4xe is still fully capable off-road. \n\nOther Wrangler updates include an available forward-facing camera on models with the 8.4-inch touchscreen, plus new 80th Anniversary and Islander models with unique features and trim. Rubicon models gain Off-Road Plus, which adjusts throttle, transmission and traction-control settings.\n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nFour-wheel drive\nFolding soft-top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower locks, windows and mirrors\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nRemote start\nAir conditioning\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nAlpine premium stereo\n7- or 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\n2021 Jeep Wrangler Vs. 2021 Toyota 4Runner: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Wrangler and 4Runner are legends among fans of off-roading, but there are some major differences between these two SUVs. To start, the Wrangler is available in two- and four-door form, while the 4Runner is only available as a four-door SUV. With four- and six-cylinder engines, along with diesel and plug-in hybrid powertrains, the Wrangler also offers more choices under the hood; the 4Runner’s sole engine is a 270-hp V-6. The 4Runner can seat up to seven with an available third row, and it does offer a rear-wheel-drive version if you don’t plan on venturing off-road. In terms of ride and handling, these SUVs are fairly evenly matched, but both are less comfortable and don’t handle as well as similarly sized SUVs. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model lacks creature comforts like standard power windows and power locks, but still starts around $30,000 — and the Wrangler Unlimited is even pricier. For your money, you’ll get a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road. Better still, the latest Wrangler is better behaved than its predecessor on paved roads.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s long-serving 4×4. It’s available as a two- or four-door SUV, the latter known as the Wrangler Unlimited. The two-door model has room for four people, while the Unlimited version seats five.\n\nA standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine works with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. Other available engines include a 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 260-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 and a 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. The Wrangler Unlimited 4xe has a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that lets the SUV travel up to 21 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for serious off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Ford Bronco, Toyota 4Runner and Land Rover Defender. The Wrangler Unlimited offers 18.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nA 4.88:1 axle ratio is optional for Rubicon models with the gas V-6, and Jeep says the cabin air filter can remove 95% of particulates. The Sahara 4xe adds blue tow hooks.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFolding soft top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower locks, windows and mirrors\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nRemote start\nAir conditioning\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAlpine premium stereo\n7- or 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model lacks creature comforts like power windows, air conditioning and power locks, but it still starts around $31,000. The more practical Wrangler Unlimited is even pricier. For your money, you get a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road. Better still, the latest Wrangler is better-behaved than its predecessor on paved surfaces.",

      "expert_review": "Several words describe the Jeep Wrangler: boxy, iconic, fun, capable. But a word I wouldn’t associate with Jeep’s off-road specialist is efficient. The Wrangler has always suffered in the fuel economy department in part because it’s hard to make a brick aerodynamic. That, however, is about to change for the 2020 Wrangler four-door, called the Unlimited, which adds a diesel powertrain as an option that delivers big gains in fuel economy and torque.\n\nRelated: 2020 Jeep Wrangler Adding Diesel Engine Option to Four-Door Models\n\nThe diesel joins the turbocharged four-cylinder and V-6 gasoline engines to give the Wrangler Unlimited three engine options. Jeep plans to offer the diesel only on the Unlimited for now, so those who want two doors will have to stick with the gas engines.\n\nI took a trip to Zion National Park in Utah to test out a pair of Wrangler Unlimiteds with the new powertrain to see what it might change, fuel economy aside. I spent time in both the street-friendly Sahara and the off-road-specialist Rubicon on pavement, and the Rubicon on a robust off-road course. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own transportation and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nHefty Powertrain\n\nThe turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 produces 260 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque, which is a big helping of additional torque. That figure far bests the numbers from the gasoline engines, which make 260 pounds-feet (V-6) and 295 pounds-feet (turbo four), respectively. The diesel is also paired with a reworked eight-speed automatic transmission designed to handle the extra torque.\n\nThe diesel engine is very similar to the one found in the Ram 1500, having virtually identical hardware, though some of it has been moved around in the Wrangler to accommodate its off-road needs. For example, the alternator has been moved to the top of the engine so the Wrangler’s fording depth can remain the same.\n\nChecking the box for the diesel adds two kinds of heft to the Wrangler Unlimited: about 400 pounds of weight and $4,000 to the price tag (in addition to $2,000 for the automatic transmission, because the manual isn’t offered). According to Jeep, the 400-pound gain is in comparison to both the gas four-cylinder and V-6 (somehow those two engines weigh the same), and most of that weight comes from the engine itself. But if you take a peek below the Wrangler Unlimited, you’ll see some extra skid plates to protect  the water/fuel separator and diesel exhaust fluid tanks. Sound deadening was also added around the engine bay to try to keep the diesel growl out of the cabin.\n\nJeep also made suspension changes to help account for the added weight, increasing the shock tuning and spring rates on EcoDiesel models. It’s those changes that seem to change the Wrangler’s road manners the most with this engine.\n\nResearch the 2020 Jeep Wrangler now.\n\nOn the Road\n\nRegardless of engine, there’s a fair bit of difference between the Sahara and the Rubicon on pavement. It’s usually favorable in the direction of the Sahara with its street-oriented tires versus the knobby all-terrain tires found on the Rubicon. In this case, however, given the changes to the suspension, I actually found the opposite to be true.\n\nWe’ve highlighted this JL generation of the Wrangler’s much improved ride quality, particularly in the longer-wheelbase Unlimited models. The EcoDiesel seems to roll back that positivity. The suspension tweaks designed to better handle the added weight produce a ride that feels brittle on the road, as if the Wrangler has just awakened and its joints are creaky.\n\nThis is especially true in the Sahara, which feels busy as the front chatters along, highlighting any imperfections in the pavement. The Wrangler’s nose also feels noticeably heavier under braking and turning, which takes away some handling confidence. These changes give the advantage on the road to the Rubicon, where its larger, knobby tires seem to do a better job of smoothing the ride out, making it feel closer to the gas versions than the Sahara does. I admit I did not see that coming.\n\nThough the ride disappoints, the diesel engine itself does not. Maximum torque is available starting at 1,400 rpm, and good off-the-line responsiveness reflects that. The power delivery is smooth and easy to control, there isn’t much jumpiness to the throttle, and it’s easy to pull the exact amount of acceleration you want. The engine also offers consistent performance at speed; some diesel engines struggle to provide even passing power, but there are no such problems here.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of engine noise, which overwhelms the added sound deadening around the engine compartment and fills the cabin with that unpleasant, grainy diesel sound anytime you start to press on the throttle. It was so loud that my drive partner and I quickly got accustomed to waiting for the engine to finish accelerating to continue our conversation. This forms a weird contrast with the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel, which has a roughly identical engine but a very quiet cabin that filters all of that noise out. From the outside, the two engines have roughly the same loudness when idling next to each other, so it’s curious that it would feel so much more overbearing in the Wrangler.\n\nJeep has stated that the EcoDiesel will have a range of “over 500 miles” with its 18.3-gallon fuel tank. Fuel economy estimates from the EPA are not yet available, but over a 104-mile drive loop of mostly highway, the Wrangler’s trip computer reported 31.2 mpg. Even if you take that figure with a grain of salt, that’s a significant jump over the highway mpg number for the gasoline engines — 22 mpg for both the V-6 and the turbocharged four-cylinder (with the automatic transmission).\n\nFind a 2020 Jeep Wrangler near you.\n\nOff the Road\n\nThis portion of the testing was where I most feared for the diesel engine for a couple of reasons. First, when driving off-road, throttle dexterity takes on premium importance, especially if you’re doing any kind of rock crawling, and the off-road course contained two or three tricky crawl sections. Second, I thought that the added poundage might have a detrimental impact on the Wrangler’s mobility.\n\nSo, with the tires aired down to 20 pounds per square inch for some added traction, I set out in a Rubicon EcoDiesel to see if my fears were misplaced — and they were. The EcoDiesel remains a fantastic off-road vehicle. The throttle mapping with four-wheel drive in 4-Low or in 4-High is spot on. You have use of all of that yummy torque, but it’s easy to modulate the throttle to get the exact amount you want. With maximum torque kicking in so early, I was wary of jerkiness from going just a bit too far on the accelerator pedal, but that wasn’t the case. This aspect of the powertrain was nearly telepathic.\n\nMy second fear was also misplaced. The added weight is no match for the added torque from the engine, and the Wrangler was as easy to manipulate as ever. From a steering and balance perspective, there was no discernible difference between the gasoline versions and the diesel. And that extra torque with the even delivery arguably gives the EcoDiesel a better experience after the pavement ends.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nJeep, Ram Diesel Emissions Scandal: What Owners Need to Know\nAll the Pickup Truck News: 2021 Chevy Colorado, Ram EcoDiesel MPG, Dirt on the 2020 Tacoma and More\nFord Bronco Bustin’ Outta the Corral at Last\n2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review: Good Old Dog Running Out of Tricks\n2020 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon EcoDiesel | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nAt What Cost\n\nThere’s no way around it: Adding the diesel engine is expensive. If you were going to get an automatic gasoline-powered model, it’s an extra $4,000, but if you’re jumping up from the manual transmission, you tack on another $2,000 for the mandatory eight-speed automatic. To make up that difference in price with the added fuel economy gains of the diesel, if it comes at all, would take a long time considering that diesel is currently more expensive than the regular fuel the gasoline engines use (the turbocharged four-cylinder will run on regular fine, though Jeep recommends premium for maximum performance).\n\nI’m glad to see the EcoDiesel will be available across all Wrangler Unlimited trim levels, which means the cheapest version you can get will be a Sport model with only the diesel and automatic checked, and that costs $39,200 (including destination charges). The vehicles I tested, however, were nowhere close to that: $55,125 for the Sahara and $63,145 for the Rubicon.\n\nThe good news, though, is that if your heart is set on the diesel, it does seem to offer significant range and efficiency advantages, and the Wrangler’s off-road capability carries on uncompromised — not to mention all of that added torque, which makes for easy acceleration. But the drawbacks in noise, ride quality and price also make it difficult for me to say that the EcoDiesel is better, just different.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited EcoDiesel is available for order now and will arrive in dealerships starting in December.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review for the 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock was written in December 2016. For 2017, Jeep has added a new trim level above the Rubicon, the Rubicon Recon Limited Edition, with beefier axle and differential components, plus new graphics inside and out. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or click here to compare the two model years.\n\nThere’s really nothing quite like a Jeep Wrangler. That’s not an exaggerated claim, either; it’s the only body-on-frame SUV on the market with two live axles and doors that not only come off, they’re easily removable. We’re about to see an all-new Wrangler introduced for 2018, so we figured one last hurrah in the outgoing model was warranted.\n\nWe drove the top-of-the-line 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock. Loaded with every conceivable piece of off-road equipment on the options list, it is utterly unlike anything on the market. But while its off-road abilities are well-established, what is it like to live with every day? Lots of people buy a Wrangler for its looks and image alone, but does it make a decent daily driver?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Wrangler looks as the Wrangler has for decades. Take a look at an original 1941 Willys and you can immediately see the lineage. It’s a shape and design philosophy as old and revered as the Porsche 911, Volkswagen Beetle or Ford Mustang. While it has varied some over the years (including a brief stint with square headlights in the 1980s), the chunky, blocky, purposeful styling has stayed much the same.\n\nSo has the body’s functionality. All four doors are completely removable via just two bolts and a fabric door-check strap. The hardtop comes off with a few more bolts and a friend to help you lift it. If you want only a little bit of sun, the Freedom Top front panels can be removed separately, or you can opt for the finicky manual soft-top for alfresco motoring whenever the mood strikes. It’s not the easiest soft-top to put up and down, requiring the removal of side panels and the rear window, but owners put up with such hassles in exchange for an open-air sensation like no other.\n\nThe Hard Rock package adds some visual flair, too, with a custom leather interior and special hood, bumpers, wheels, badges and some top content as well, like an Alpine premium audio system and heated front seats.\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of the Wrangler’s styling: If you don’t like it, you can change it. Myriad aftermarket companies offer everything from fenders to bumpers to auxiliary lights. All it takes is money.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nJudging how the Wrangler Unlimited drives depends entirely on where you’re driving it. Take it to your local off-road park, through the California desert, over towering coastal sand dunes or through a forest full of mud holes and two-track ravines, and it’s brilliant.\n\nThe list of parts that help the Wrangler go anywhere unpaved is long: There’s part-time four-wheel drive with a 4:1 creeper gear; a 4.10 final drive ratio; electronically lockable front and rear differentials on heavy-duty Dana 44 solid axles; beefy off-road shocks and springs; skid plates protecting various underbody components; electronically disconnecting front sway bar links; super-chunky BFGoodrich M/T Mud-Terrain tires; and 10.5 inches of ground clearance. It soldiers along broken, boulder-strewn, rutted dirt hard-pack trails like a champ, soaking up terrain that would set your teeth rattling and kidneys bruising in just about any other vehicle. It’s made to be off-road, and that’s where it excels like no other.\n\nGet back on the street, however, and you’ll be singing an altogether different tune. The engine — a 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 — is the only one offered, mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional five-speed automatic. Many enthusiasts get excited when they see that a manual is still available, but they shouldn’t be; it’s awful, with a rubbery feel and a shift lever so long you’ll feel like you’re shifting an oar. The automatic works much better for everyday driving on- or off-road, but you’d never call the Wrangler quick. It’s geared for off-road torque, not brisk acceleration or highway cruising comfort.\n\nOn the street it’s poky and ponderous, and the Rubicon suspension that was so amazing in the rough is soft and marshmallowy on tarmac. Accelerate, and the truck squats on the back wheels thanks to the soft off-road shocks. Hit the brakes, and the nose dips noticeably. Crosswinds are a nightmare on the highway (or even around town) because of the Wrangler’s slab sides and tall off-road tires. The soft brakes don’t work with any sense of immediacy, either. Simply put, the Wrangler makes an awful daily driver, family vehicle or first-time ride for a teenage driver.\n\nThe Wrangler’s one true saving grace, however, is enough for hundreds of thousands of buyers every year to overlook all that: You can take the top and doors completely off, immediately turning your car into an open-air beach buggy that provides a sense of freedom unlike anything short of a motorcycle.\n\nFuel economy is terrible, but that’s not unexpected given the Wrangler has all the aerodynamic efficiency of a single-family bungalow. The automatic-equipped Wrangler is EPA-rated 16/20/18 mpg city/highway/combined. That figure gets 1 mpg better on the highway in the manual version thanks to its extra gear. My 260 miles of mixed driving netted 18.9 mpg combined, so I’d say the ratings are pretty much spot-on. Of course, if you take the top and doors off, what little aerodynamic efficiency the Wrangler has goes right out the window and you might see your mileage drop — but then, the Jeep will be lighter, so maybe it’s a wash.\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s a climb up into the Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon’s cabin thanks to its 10.5-inch ground clearance and big tires. Once you’re there, it’s throwback time. The last time the Wrangler got an interior update was in 2011, when it received a curvier, more carlike dashboard, as opposed to the blockier, cheaper one that preceded it. Nothing has changed in the intervening six years, with the switches, controls and materials still reminiscent of Chrysler’s freshly post-bankruptcy days.\n\nThe front seats are decently comfortable but not terribly big or very adjustable by modern standards. The backseat can fit three people in a pinch, but it’s low to the floor, putting passengers in a knees-up position and not giving them much in the way of legroom.\n\nThe beauty of this interior is its customizability. Don’t like the silver trim color? You can replace it with a Mopar colored trim kit, paint the removable bits yourself or go to any number of aftermarket parts sites for all kinds of embellishments. There are seat covers in just about any color you can imagine and varieties of fabrics — there’s even colored leather replacement upholstery. There are dozens of aftermarket tops, replacement tube doors and custom holders for all kinds of accessories, from fire extinguishers to flashlights to coolers. The resources available to make a Wrangler your own are immense, limited only by your imagination and wallet. The only real problem is that the inexpensive standard interior in my test car came in a vehicle costing nearly $50,000. For that much money, it should be decidedly better than it is.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Wrangler’s gauges are small, but they’re easy to read and don’t overload the driver with all kinds of information. In many ways, the Wrangler’s vintage nature carries through to its electronics — there isn’t much in the way of fancy technology in here, as you wouldn’t really want much in an interior that’s meant to get wet. The Wrangler’s controls are simple and easy to use, with switches that are easy to find, including those that activate the locking axles and sway-bar disconnect.\n\nThe multimedia system itself is positively ancient by Chrysler’s own standards — now that the old minivans have been retired in favor of the new Pacifica, the Wrangler remains the only vehicle in the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stable that features this style multimedia system, which dates back to the previous decade. Yet while it isn’t the latest Uconnect system, there’s something to be said for its dead-nuts simple operation and design. It’s not flashy, but for audio and multimedia files, it works quite well.\n\nThe optional Alpine premium audio system is a must-have. It’s designed specifically for the Wrangler’s horrible acoustics and speaker placement, and its more robust speakers, dedicated amp and floor-mounted rear subwoofer make a huge difference. If you opt for the regular stereo, you won’t be able to hear it if you remove the top and doors. The Alpine system knows when you’ve got the top down and adjusts output accordingly.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited features 31.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which fold flat to open up a cavernous 70.6 cubic feet of total cargo room. If you opt for a two-door Wrangler you don’t get nearly as much space. That model features a two-passenger bench in the back that folds forward but not much out of the way. It is removable, however, allowing for 55 cubic feet of total cargo room, but then you’ll have reduced your Wrangler to a two-seater.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Wrangler Unlimited has not been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in any crash test except a rollover, where it scored three out of five stars, making it one of the last few passenger vehicles on the market rated below four stars. Test results from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety are decidedly mixed: The Wrangler four-door scored good (out of a possible good, acceptable, fair and poor) for small and moderate overlap front tests, but only marginal for side-impact and head restraint tests. There are no crash avoidance technologies available on the Wrangler — like forward collision warning or autonomous braking — or even parking sensors, blind spot monitors or a backup camera.\n\nTo top it all off, the Wrangler’s headlights are abysmal. The incandescent bulbs cast a tragically weak beam and are rated poor by IIHS. Optional LED headlights are available for 2017, but the standard headlights are truly terrible (and one of the first things most new owners swap out for aftermarket units upon purchase).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Wrangler is an expensive vehicle, especially considering the level of technology and refinement you get. Even base models cost more than you might expect, but they do have one benefit: They hold their resale value better than nearly any other vehicle on the market. Still, a basic 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Sport starts at $28,690 including destination fee, and it goes up from there. There are often special editions each year and always a unique color or two. The price for my tester, a top-trim Rubicon with the Hard Rock package, began at $37,990 but ended up at an eye-watering $48,120 — and there were still options to be had.\n\nAll competitors have fallen by the wayside over the years as safety regulations and fuel economy requirements have taken all the true off-roaders, well, off the road in the U.S. The Ford Bronco, Nissan Xterra, Toyota FJ Cruiser, Hummer H3, Suzuki Samurai and even the Land Rover Defender have all come to an end while the Wrangler soldiers on.\n\nThere are still a few competitors that might be comparable, one of which comes from Jeep itself. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk has many of the same abilities as the Wrangler but is wrapped in a much more civilized package. That package is also heavier, lacks a removable top and doors, and isn’t as happy off-road as the Wrangler, relying on electronic systems instead of mechanical force to get the job done. You could also head over to a Toyota dealer to grab one of the last old-style SUVs around, the Toyota 4Runner, which is available in a very capable TRD Pro trim that has a good deal of off-road equipment. Like the Grand Cherokee, the 4Runner offers those abilities in a much more civilized SUV wrapper than you’ll find in the Wrangler. Finally, the least expensive model from the only other all-SUV brand offers some off-road abilities in a much more compact model: The Land Rover Range Rover Evoque goes off-road in the same way the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk does, through electronic traction manipulation. Compare all four here.\n\nIn the end, the Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon offers buyers a singularly unique experience. It does only two things well, but it does those things supremely well: go off-road through extremely rough terrain and look incredibly cool just about anywhere it pulls up. Many owners love it despite the driving experience, not because of it. It’s sloppy, loud, uncomfortable, slow, ponderous, wallowy, inefficient, cheap-feeling, questionably safe and not particularly reliable — and on top of all that, it’s expensive. But nothing else out there delivers the playful feeling a Wrangler does, nor the instant community you join when you buy one. Never has there been a vehicle where the phrase, “either you get it or you don’t” applies more.",
