      "expert_review": "The 1998 Jeep Wrangler isn’t perfect, but it is much better than the previous generation, which was phased out in 1996.\n\nAt highway speeds the engine revs high and guzzles gas, returning a shameful 11 miles per gallon at 70 mph (with the air conditioner running). That is nowhere near the EPA estimate of 18 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe test vehicle seemed to be running fine, so I don’t think the poor fuel economy can be blamed on a mechanical failure.\n\nStill, I can’t gripe about the Wrangler’s performance. This small Jeep is not just fast, it’s powerful too.\n\nChrysler engineers gave the Wrangler an all-new suspension system. They tossed out the old leaf-spring suspension and mated a version of the Grand Cherokee’s Quadra Coil system to the Wrangler’s rugged steel frame.\n\nThe result is a vehicle that can take a tremendous pounding off-road while still offering an almost carlike ride on smooth pavement.\n\nThe suspension is still firm, but rolling over a big bump won’t make the Wrangler buck and lurch like a wild bronco.\n\nThe vehicle’s new dash is attractive and user-friendly. I particularly liked the high-quality feel of the switches for the turn signals and windshield wipers. The AM/FM stereo came with a CD player and a cassette deck.\n\nHowever, all these strong points are canceled out by problems, such as cheap carpet and poorly positioned window cranks.\n\nThe Wrangler we tested was a ’97, but the 1998 model is virtually identical. Wrangler has a unique character and a real personality. There’s nothing bland about this machine. It has a cool, macho all-American image. And I really like that. The brawny Wrangler makes the imports look like Tonka toys.\n\n1998 Jeep Wrangler Sport\n\nBase price: $17,140.\n\nPrice as tested: $22,628.\n\nSafety: Dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes.\n\nEngine and transmission: 4.0-liter six-cylinder, four-speed automatic.\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city/18 mpg highway.\n\nIncentives: None.",

      "expert_review": "A two-inch layer of ice is covering Hades this morning.\n\nMust be, because a few years ago after driving a Jeep Wrangler and commenting that even Mother Teresa would find fault with this vehicle, Chrysler Corp. vowed that it would be a cold day down below before this scribe laid hands on the automaker’s smallest sport-utility vehicle again.\n\nChrysler relented, motivated by the fact that the ’97 Wrangler has been redesigned (modestly) and re-engineered (a major technological revamp).\n\nAfter test driving the 1997 version of this relic of World War (feel free to argue I, II or Civil), we found ourselves relenting, too.\n\nWe were harsh on the Wrangler in the past because it was so unforgiving on the driver and any other occupant who dared venture inside.\n\nIt was rude and crude. The engine was under powered, suspension abysmal, ride rough and handling unpredictable at best. Cold in the winter, noisy in any season. Safety systems were limited to a St. Christopher statue (optional) hung from the rearview mirror because there was no dash to rest it on.\n\n“Only in a Jeep” referred to the amount of abuse and suffering that you had to tolerate.\n\nYouth, however, loved the vehicle as only youth can, because Wrangler was a symbol of freedom, bravado, derring-do–and the fact that youth didn’t have enough money to buy a real sport-utility so it had to settle for the bottom of the barrel.\n\nThat was then and this is now.\n\nFor 1997, Wrangler has been civilized without being sanitized.\n\nNo longer can you pick Wrangler owners out from the crowd because they’re the ones carrying pillows and blankets to the parking lot–pillows for seat cushions, blankets for heat.\n\nBut the Wrangler Sport we tested is still a bit Third World. You still are burdened with plastic zippered windows that make every stop at the toll booth or drive up window an adventure in dexterity; step-in height requires you reach into the pocket or purse and shell out $73 for the optional steps for any chance of entry or exit decorum; and with the optional, oversized all-terrain radial tires, Wrangler is a bit skittish in sharp corners or along winding merger ramps at speed. You must remember to keep one eye on the road, one on the signs with those squiggly arrows that advise you to turn the wheel.\n\nOn the civilized side, the teeth-rattling, buckboard ride is gone and you now can leave the mouth guard home.\n\nAlso, cabin decibel levels that made the radio simply an ornament in the dash have been muffled–not eliminated, but no longer at the blast-the-wax-out-of-your-ears level.\n\nAnd as a sign that Wrangler’s war years are behind it, dual air bags are standard, anti-lock brakes an option. ABS is offered only with the 4-liter engine in the Sport and Sahara and only as an option, which means youth and those on a tight budget might take a pass on it to save $599. Better you sacrifice fo g lamps and aluminum-spoke wheels than ABS.\n\nThe appearance of the bags is significant because it makes this vehicle a viable choice in the sport-ute market to those who had argued that small SUVs were unsafe.\n\nThe ’97 Wrangler looks a lot like each generation before it, which Chrysler officials insist was the No. 1 demand of loyalists surveyed in 1993 to determine what they wanted from a 1997 redesign.\n\nThe most visible change is upfront as round headlamps return to replace the rectangular ones favored by the spandex crowd.\n\nRefinements include a stiffer chassis with less bending and therefore less noise; leaf springs replaced by Quadra coil suspension similar to that in the Grand Cherokee with 7 inches more play so you don’t feel like you are traveling off-road when you are on road; a closed glove compartment rather than an open glove box; a flip-over rear seat to increase cargo room; a 6-inch widening of that seat so cheek to cheek refers to dancing nott avel in the back of a Wrangler; and repositioning and integrating the fuel filler door into the side of the body rather than behind the rear license plate carrier, where it had been a chore to use.\n\nOther noteworthy features include a quicker to raise/lower soft top; a light and, therefore, quicker-to-use, optional hardtop; an easy swing-out rear door with full-size spare attached; more ergonomically designed clutch/brake/gas pedals and steering column, which means they all are in front of you and not off to one side; two more miles per gallon in the city and three more on the highway with the standard 5-speed manual, though mileage is still nothing to write home about (17 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway) unless it’s to beg for an increase in the gasoline allowance.\n\nThe base Wrangler is offered with a 2.5-liter, 120-horsepower, 4-cylinder and a choice of 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic; the Sport and Sahara a 4-liter, in-line, 6-cylinder rated at 181-h.p. and available with the 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.\n\nOur test vehicle came with the 4-liter and very smooth-shifting 5-speed. The 4-liter has been tweaked a bit so though horsepower is about what it had been, maximum torque kicks in at 2,800 r.p.m. rather than 4,000 r.p.m. as it had. That means you move more quickly from the light.\n\nAnother Wrangler strength is the standard power steering that allows you to maneuver with unusual dexterity through the parking-lot maze and into that tiny opening between the two luxury sedans. There’s a lightness to the wheel without it being sloppy.\n\nOff-roaders and Snow Belters will appreciate Command Trac, the ability to shift on the fly into four-wheel-drive high (you must stop to engage low) when the sand gets deep or the snow gets thick.\n\nThe Wrangler Sport starts at $16,682, and with Toyota’s new RAV4, gives consumers a choice of two excellent, though smaller, sport-utility vehicles for less than $20,000.\n\nWrangler, as with the RAV4, however, can be dressed up with an extensive and expensive array of options–$599 for ABS, $530 for automatic transmission, $755 for a hardtop, $878 for air conditioning, $423 for AM/FM stereo with cassette.\n\n>> 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport Wheelbase: 93.4 inches Length: 151.8 inches Engine: 4-liter, 181-h.p., in-line6-cylinder Transmission: 5-speed manual (4-speed automatic optional) EPA mileage: 17 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway. Base price: $16,682 Price as tested: $20,281. Includes $107 for Pueblo cloth seats; $528 for Sport package, including full console with cupholders and lockable storage, courtesy lights, engine compartment light, extra-capacity fuel tank (19 gallons versus 15 gallons), tilt steering, intermittent wipers and conventional spare; $599 for four-wheel ABS; $18 for floor mats; $278 for r ear locking differential; $878 for air conditioning; $110 for fog lamps; $73for bodyside steps; $423 for AM/FM stereo with cassette; $308 for p225/75R15 all-terrain radial tires; $237 for aluminum spoke wheels; $40 for front tow hooks. Freight runs $510. Pluses: Freshened–though modestly–design. Dual air bags, ABS, four-wheel-drive. Ride as smooth as it once was bumpy. Not just another $25,000 to $30,000 SUV. Minuses: ABS optional. Extensive and expensive options. Mileage not real impressive. Zippered plastic windows. >>",

      "expert_review": "Talk about retro. The Jeep Wrangler is about as retro as you can get – a vehicle with direct lineage to World War II – and it still stands out as the ultimate in fun-to-drive, go-anywhere vehicles.\n\nIn a world overburdened with luxury sport-utility vehicles, the Wrangler stands apart with a distinctive image – adventurous and macho, maybe even a little risky.\n\nThe handling may be skittish, and there may be a cacophony of noises from the tire tread, engine and drive line, but what the Wrangler lacks in comfort and drivability is made up in style and spirit. Plus, it’s the most fun for the dollar of any new vehicle that comes to mind, especially one with a canvas roof and a windshield that can be folded flat.\n\nThis new generation of Wrangler, unveiled in 1998, is much improved over its square-headlight predecessor. Improved suspension with coil springs and a better front end, beefier chassis, much-better dashboard and styling that succeeds in capturing the old look of the CJs – these are some of the changes that brought new life to the old military-Jeep formula.\n\nWrangler still feels old-fashioned with its separate front fenders, long-handled shifter and flat windshield. This is all part of the fun stuff, the Jeep image.\n\nThe ride is rough and tumble, although tumbling is one thing that’s seriously warned against on the sun visor. A wider track and the upgraded suspension are designed to fight the rollover threat of the old CJs. A heavy, rill-cage armament adds protection.\n\nBut it’s still a high-profile vehicle with a short wheelbase, so you can’t zip around like a sports-car driver, even though it might feel like a sports car.\n\nOn the freeway, the noise level can get intense, including the rustling of the fabric top. The Wrangler just sails along, though, the smooth-running, tried-and-true straight six humming competently.\n\nBut you have to keep on top of the steering or the Jeep will wander all over the road. And the short wheelbase – the rear wheels are just behind your ears – creates a choppy ride over the expansion joints. Around town, the Jeep is loads of fun because you sit high above the crowd in this tough little critter. Unlike the big, clumsy sport utes, the Jeep slips ably through traffic.\n\nOf course, the Jeep is best appreciated off the asphalt, where the short wheelbase is a definite plus and the mountain-goat characteristics of the Command-Trac four-wheel-drive system shine. On a difficult, boulder-strewn trail, the Wrangler climbed over the rough stuff effortlessly, easier than just about anything else I’d had up there. But a front-seat passenger felt buffeted by the stiff suspension.\n\nNaturally, the best way to enjoy the Wrangler is with the top down. But taking down the top, loaded with zippers and plastic parts that clip unto the body, is a chore. As tough as getting it down may be, putting it back up is worse. It’s like setting up the Ringling Bros. circus tent. My fi ngers are still healing. Wrangler veterans assure me it gets easier with practice.\n\nThe test Wrangler was the top-end Sahara edition, fully equipped at $21,105, which is pretty affordable these days. The entry-level model starts at just $15,020. The Sahara includes such beneficial items as the 4-liter engine, fog lamps, fender flares, side steps, stereo with CD player and four speakers, and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels shod with off-highway tires. Plus, a handsome tan and green upholstery that matches the classic green of the body and tan of the top.\n\nParked in the desert, the Wrangler presented a picturesque scene that no sport-utility vehicle could hope to match. It’s a true American classic, maybe more so than anything else on the road.\n\n2000 Jeep Wrangler\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door utility vehicle, rear/four-wheel drive.\nBase price: $20,545.\nPrice as tested: $21,105.\nEngine: 4.0-liter in-line 6, 181 hp a t 4,60 0 rpm, 222 lb.-ft. of torque at 2,800 rpm.\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\nCurb weight: 3,333 lbs.\nWheelbase: 93.4 inches.\nEPA mileage: 16 city, 19 highway.\nHighs: Off-road prowess.

      "expert_review": "One would never expect to need a four-wheel drive vehicle unless snow is flying. But, this case tested that theory.\n\nI needed to travel to Philly to attend to some family business when the heavens opened. Rumbling thunder, blinding lightning and a torrential downpour made the going tricky. Ponding on the roadway made travel treacherous.\n\nSo, I threw the Jeep Wrangler into four-wheel-drive and watched the miles go by.\n\nThis tough little buggy outlived a few wars, in addition to a few car companies that weren’t as rugged as the Wrangler (American Bantam, Willys, Kaiser-Frazer and AMC). So, I knew it would get through the storm.\n\nThis bouncy little buggy is still the top-seller in its class, outselling many newer rivals. It’s easy to see why. While many trucks try for comfort, civility and class, this truck doesn’t. It’s basic and proud of it.\n\nAvailable in SE, Sport and Sahara trim levels, this little 4×4 comes with a 120-horsepower 2.5-liter OHV 4-cylinder engine standard, hitched to a part-time four-wheel-drive system. Optional is a 180-horsepower 4-liter OHV 6-cylinder engine. A three-speed automatic is optional.\n\nNeedless to say, the 6-cylinder is the way to go. It furnishes the power needed to haul around 3,267 pounds of Jeep. It also helps when you opt for the ancient three-speed automatic.\n\nJeeps are about basic, rugged transportation, so sound insulation is non-existent. That means the agricultural grunts of the engine make it through with roaring clarity to the passenger compartment. So does road, wind and tire noise. So does the standard soft top, whose zip up side windows rattle annoyingly all the time. Maybe this is why so few Jeeps have their side curtains in place.\n\nJeep uses live axles front and rear, so the ride is lively. You’ll feel bumps in the road you never knew existed. The flip side is superb agility off-road, or even on-road, when conditions approach those off-road.\n\nBut the noise and the ride make this a vehicle for truly rugged souls.\n\nThe Wrangler’s tidy 93.4-inch wheelbase gives it terrific maneuverability, something that can’t be said of most 4x4s. It also calls for care in cornering, although the Wrangler never felt tippy, despite 8.5 inches of ground clearance. But the soggy steering never imparted a feeling of confidence.\n\nBraking was good, thanks to anti-lock brakes, standard with 4-liter engine. They stopped the vehicle quickly, but accompanied by some nose-dive.\n\nWith only 153 inches of overall length, you wouldn’t expect a lot of room inside, but it’s more than sufficient for four people. The driving position has chair height seating, although lower back support was minimal. The rear seat is the perfect spot for two kids. They love this type of vehicle and won’t mind the body contortions necessary to get back there.\n\nIf you do carry four people, there will be only 11 cubic feet of cargo space, most of it vertical. So leave the steamer trunk at home.\n\nThe Wrangler comes with a soft top that takes quite a while to remove or replace. If you’re planning to do either, it’ll take a while. A hard top with roll-up windows and tinted glass is optional on all models. A dual-top package with both hard and soft tops is also optional.\n\nIt’s a tall step up into the Wrangler’s interior, but once there, the demeanor is as basic as its chiseled exterior. Doors swing open, retained only by fabric straps. Screw heads are visible everywhere, as well as an assortment of clamps and arms that hold the top in place. A pair of radio speakers are located in the roll bar in the middle of the passenger compartment. The only power-assisted items are steering and brakes. Everything else is manual. To most new sport-ute buyers, this is roughing it, especially if you commute on toll roads and have to constantly zip and unzip the windows.\n\nThe instrument cluster is easy to read and is complete with oil and voltage readouts. The AM/FM/ CD player sits atop th e center of t he dash where it’s easy to reach.\n\nRemarkably, for all the body motions in this vehicle, the CD player never skips. Yet, with the inexpensive nature of the interior, it would be nice if Jeep could spend more money on the speakers, whose tinny sound is remarkably poor.\n\nJust as bad is the radio, whose pulling power is non-existent and which has interference from electrical lines in places where almost any other audio system is clear. This really needs work, especially considering the young age of the Jeep’s enthusiastic audience.\n\nOf course, with all the noise in the interior, you may not notice the radio at all.\n\nDual airbags are standard; a kidney belt is not.\n\nBut even with all the advances in automotive technology, some things remain constant. The basic, rugged nature of the Jeep Wrangler persists, outselling a host of imitators. For this iconic little truck is the real thing. Nothing can stop it — not the death of car companies, world wars or even Consumer Reports (who rates it last among small utes).\n\nThe original is still the greatest.\n\n>> 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sahara 4WD\n\nVehicle type: Small 4WD Sport utility\n\nEngines: 2.5-liter OHV V-4, 4-liter OHV V6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic\n\nWheelbase: 93.4 inches\n\nLength: 153 inches\n\nCargo volume: 11.1 cubic feet\n\nTires: P225/75R15 OWL A/T\n\nBase price, base model: $14,345\n\nBase price, test model: $20,135\n\nAs tested: $23,710\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city, 18 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 15 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular >>",

      "expert_review": "The Jeep Wrangler is like a four-wheeled mountain bike.\n\nThe name itself embodies good ol’ American toughness because it is rooted in World War II. A Jeep has a rugged aura that appeals to outdoor folks, the ones who dig hiking boots, wool socks, strong coffee and roads that are as rough as a cow track through the tallgrass prairie.\n\nThere is a loyal and hardy contingent of Wrangler owners who take their vehicles off-road, and each year DaimlerChrysler puts on 40 two-day Jeep Jamborees at a number of locations around North America so drivers can learn to perfect their off-highway driving skills under supervision. Camp Jeep is a three-day fun fest of outdoor activities targeted at Jeep owners who want to learn more about the capabilities of their vehicles while participating in outdoor activities.\n\nThat said, however, a majority of Wrangler drivers use them in everyday driving. When the Wrangler was redesigned in 1997 it retained all of its off-road capability yet it got safer, more civilized and more suitable for road use. It got a new frame, a wider wheelbase and improved creature comforts, such as dual front airbags, power steering and a ride that is not as punishing on the pavement as the older models.\n\nThere are three Wrangler models: the base SE with a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine starts at just under $15,000; the Sport with a 4.0-liter, six-cylinder begins at $19,055; and the top-of-the-line Sahara is roughly $21,000.\n\nI drove a Wrangler Sport with the 4.0-liter engine and a five-speed manual transmission. This engine has strong mid-range torque, or pulling power, and it responds with little prodding. An automatic transmission is optional.\n\nThe Command-Trac part-time four-wheel-drive system is good for off-road use. Our test vehicle also had the Trac-Lok rear differential for even tougher challenges.\n\nFor 2001, changes continue. The cloth top is thicker and quieter, although the wind noise at highway speeds still drowns out the radio. The tilt steering wheel has greater adjustability, and tether anchors have been installed for child safety seats. The anti-lock brake system is new and an optional full-length console has cupholders for rear-seat passengers.\n\nWranglers are fun to drive because they are the personification of basic transportation. They turn on a dime, have a canvas top (a metal one is optional) and make no pretense toward luxury despite the fact that options include air-conditioning, metal doors with roll-up windows, anti-lock brakes and an AM/FM/CD stereo. A Wrangler is a go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle.\n\nThe same no-nonsense ride and the short, 93.4-inch wheelbase responsible for off-road maneuverability also bounce passengers around in daily use. Although the ride quality wasn’t intolerable, I certainly wouldn’t want to drive one from here to Colorado. (A friend of mine does.) Freeway pavement joints never pass unnoticed.\n\nYou won’t find much room in the back seat and the only way to secure valuables is with the add-a-trunk lockable storage compartment.\n\nDespite the Wrangler’s rough edges, it is appealing because it is simple and forthright.\n\nPrice: The base price of our test vehicle, a Wrangler Sport, was $19,055. Options included high-back bucket seats, floor console, tilt steering wheel, full-size spare tire and matching wheel, anti-lock brakes, Trac-Lok differential, metal doors with roll-up windows, air conditioning, storage trunk and side steps. The sticker price was $23,985.\n\nWarranty: Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Jeep Wrangler is a rugged, off-road-capable vehicle that has been civilized for street use. The big six-cylinder engine has oodles of oomph, the steering is cat-quick and the top comes off if you have a hankering for open-air rock crawling.\n\nCounterpoint: The ride is choppy, the canvas top noisy and gas mileage is poor.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.0-liter, 4-cyl.\nTransmission: Five-speed\nFour-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 93.4 inches\nCurb weight: 3,316 lbs.\nBase price: $19,055\nAs driven: $23,985\nMpg rating: 16 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "The Jeep Wrangler is Chrysler’s long-running edition of the classic World War II military vehicle. Years ago, the civilian Jeep left the foxhole for Friends territory, where it continues to attract a loyal following, especially among teen-aged drivers.\n\nWe’re no longer teen-agers and we don’t watch Friends. Perhaps that explains why we found the 2002 Wrangler X, priced at $23,680, so contentious.\n\nShe: I can see by our star ratings on the Wrangler X that we didn’t do a Vulcan Mind Meld on this one.\n\nHe: Boy, you’re really giving away your age with that one, Ms. Trekkie.\n\nShe: I know we’re not totally on the same wave-length here. I had some problems with the X, which is the mid-level, six-cylinder Wrangler. But they largely had to do with the fact that when I was running errands, I was only able to fit 24 cans of dog food in the rear cargo hold. And I had nowhere to hang my dry-cleaning. But for the most part, this is an adorable little SUV, complete with neat seats that have fuzzy fabric on the bottom and leather-like material on top. The Wrangler is a snap to park. You just wedge it in wherever you feel like it. And every time you get in it, you feel like you’re going on an adventure, not to work.\n\nHe: Then why does it feel like it takes so much work just to climb in and out of the Wrangler? I’m surprised that those high sills and ground clearance don’t bother a 5-3 shrimp like you. And outside of parking, it IS a lot of work to operate this Jeep. Imagine, for nearly $24,000, you don’t get power windows. Or power mirrors. Or power door locks. That’s not only inconvenient, but it’s also a potential safety and security issue, when you can’t reach over easily to adjust the passenger-side mirror or lock the door. Those seem like basic amenities that you get even on the least expensive economy cars that cost half as much as this Jeep. In fact, this probably would be a decent $14,000 vehicle, but for $23,680, I’m not sure what teen-ager could even afford to think about owning this Wrangler.\n\nShe: And yet, we see lots of kids driving Wranglers all over southeastern Michigan, so there must be a powerful attraction there. I’ve talked with enough Jeep owners and lovers, too, to know that the Wrangler is something of an icon with the off-road set. But you can also take the top down on a sunny day and drive one of the most unique convertibles on the road. That kind of versatility has to be worth something.\n\nHe: I see the Wrangler as a limited-use vehicle that I wouldn’t recommend to a friend or to a friend’s son or daughter. You mentioned how easy it is to park the Wrangler, which is partly a function of its short wheelbase. But that same short wheelbase — the distance between the front and rear wheels — makes the Wrangler feel like a bucking bronco on rough pavement, and combined with the higher center of gravity, makes it feel tippy if you take corners too fast. I would feel really uncomfortable to have my k ids riding in a Wrangler, especially when you consider the doors are so thin, there’s not much metal between you and the vehicle next to you. Nor can you get side air bags. You even have to pay $600 extra to get antilock brakes.\n\nShe: You’re always lecturing me, but I think you’re missing the point here. Younger drivers like the authentic look of the Wrangler, and they probably don’t mind the bouncy ride all that much. I know they’ll probably appreciate the big 4.0-liter, six-cylinder engine that comes in the Wrangler X and makes 190 horsepower. Be forewarned that with the optional three-speed automatic, you’re going to get pretty dismal mileage — 15 miles per gallon in city driving, according to the EPA, and only 17 on the highway. And that’s for a compact sport-ute that really can seat only four adults.\n\nHe: A few more complaints. The driver-side visor kept knocking the rear-view mirror out of whack when I lowered it. The interior pieces didn’t fit together well, and the exposed metal seams had some very sharp edges. And the wind noise at moderate speeds is pretty bad, even for a convertible. Bottom line — one star. This is one of the least impressive vehicles I’ve tested in the past several years.\n\n2002 Jeep Wrangler\n\nAnita’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Subpar)\n\nLikes: Easy to park. Classic military Jeep design. Strong visual appeal to teens. Nimble offroad capability. Unique among convertibles.\n\nDislikes: Primitive in nearly every respect. Ridiculously overpriced at nearly $24,000. Excessive wind noise. High sill makes entry/exit difficult. Hard to climb in and out of rear seat. Miniscule cargo bay. Tippy in corners. ABS costs $600 extra. Visor hits rear-view mirror. Extremely rough and bouncy ride. No power mirrors, windows or locks. Sub-par quality, including sloppy trim, exposed metal seams.\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, 4-passenger utility vehicle\n\nPrice: Base, $18,410; as tested, $23,680 (inc. $585 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 4.0-liter I-6; 190-hp; 235 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/17 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,134 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Toledo, Ohio",

      "expert_review": "It used to be that the idea of buying a Wrangler was always tempered by “yeah, buts.” “Yeah, it looks like a lot of fun, but I have a family.” So Jeep added a four-door model in 2007. “Yeah, I can take more people now, but the powertrain is terrible.” So Jeep gave it a new engine for 2012. “Yeah, it’s smoother and more powerful now, but it’s awful on-road.”\n\nNo more “yeah, buts” for the Jeep Wrangler with this all-new 2018 redesign. The new Wrangler “JL” has been thoroughly reworked from the ground up, and the guys in charge of doing it are themselves Jeep fans who interact frequently with die-hard, loyal Wrangler owners and enthusiasts. They had a list of more than 30 items that needed redoing, according to Wrangler’s chief engineer, so the team set about refining and redesigning the icon without reimagining it. The Wrangler’s mission remains as it was: to be the most capable, go-anywhere off-road vehicle that is still affordable and everyday-usable. With the last of the “yeah, buts” removed, the Jeep Wrangler now comes with a hefty dose of refinement inside and out, making it a more civilized, more approachable vehicle than ever before.\n\nVery Wrangler to Look At\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking not much has changed, stylistically. But you’d be wrong — park the new JL side by side with the old JK and you’ll realize that it’s considerably revised. The front end is smoother and higher, with taller fenders and a more trapezoidal shape to the grille. The windshield is also more raked and flatter than before — meaning it sits more level with the hood if you fold it down, which is easier than ever to do: Removing just four bolts at the top of the windshield, plus yanking off the wiper arms, allows you to tilt the windshield frame forward against the hood and secure it with a provided strap. This gives new meaning to the idea of open-air motoring, but it also is something of a mixed blessing.\n\nI drove the new Jeep Wrangler off-road, up some steep rocky inclines, with the windshield down and didn’t care for the lack of glass in front of me. The problem: It adds a good 4 to 5 inches to the hood’s height, making visibility off-road even more difficult. In areas where seeing over the hood is most important, you’ll want to leave the windshield in place. If you’re just bumming around on a beach or want to feel more wind in your teeth, don some goggles and head down the highway.\n\nThere are optional LED headlights for Sahara and Rubicon trim levels, optional LED taillights and standard LED turn signals in the fenders. Those fenders are now an inch higher to allow buyers to mount 33-inch tires without needing to install a lift kit — Rubicon fenders are higher still, allowing for 35-inch optional tires without a lift kit. The new Wrangler comes in fewer trim levels: base Sport, nicer Sport S and rock-crawling Rubicon for the two-door. The four-door Wrangler, no longer called Unlimited, adds the more luxurious Sahara between the Sport S and Rubicon.\n\nVery Un-Wrangler to Drive\n\nClimb up into the taller driver’s seat (an inch higher than the old one) and push the new standard starter button to fire up one of two engines available at launch: A carryover 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, making 285 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, will be familiar to any Fiat Chrysler Automobiles fans, although it now features a standard stop-start fuel-saver system. It’s mated to either a vastly improved six-speed manual transmission — which no longer rattles and vibrates the shifter as it trundles along — or a new optional eight-speed automatic that’s also out of FCA’s corporate parts bin. The optional engine on the two-door or four-door is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder mild-hybrid engine. It uses what is essentially a heavy-duty 48-volt alternator that’s attached to the crankshaft via a belt, which aids in low-speed initial starts and other conditions to improve fuel economy. The turbo four is only available mated to the automatic transmission. A turbocharged 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 is coming, but not until the 2019 model year.\n\nI sampled both powertrains in my drive in, over, around and through the wilds of Tucson, Ariz., and during a week with a two-door Rubicon model back home. I found the V-6 to be adequately smooth and powerful, and the slick redesigned manual transmission is a far cry from the sloppy, imprecise older version. But the new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is better than the V-6. Mated only to the automatic transmission, it makes 270 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque but feels amazingly torquey, punchy and quick around town. I drove a four-door model loaded up with a hardtop, three full-size humans and a lot of camera gear, and the turbo engine felt responsive and zippy, with the eight-speed auto shifting seamlessly and smoothly through the gears. Only on some low-speed corners did I find it in a gear lower than I wanted, but the transmission’s quick-shifting nature and utter lack of turbo lag poured on speed with remarkable ease. As much as the addition of the 3.6-liter Pentastar engine transformed the Jeep Wrangler into a usable daily driver in 2012, that’s how much better the new 2.0-liter is for 2018.\n\nRide and handling have also received a massive shot in the arm thanks to a revised suspension, wider axles, improved tires and a new electrohydraulic steering system (with an electric motor-driven pump). The Jeep Wrangler still drives like a light truck — you won’t confuse this for a car-based Toyota RAV4 or Jeep’s own Cherokee — but no longer does it feel ponderous or sloppy around turns. The Sport and Sahara models were well-controlled, provided acceptable steering feedback and even had a decently comfortable ride over rough pavement. It feels like a modern mid-size pickup truck, such as a Chevrolet Colorado or Toyota Tacoma, in that it’s no longer a penalty box, but it’s still not quite the smooth and well-damped environment of a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Only so much can be done to hide the fact that there are still two solid live axles front and rear, and in stiff crosswinds, you’ll still get blown all over the highway (you are driving something with the aerodynamic profile of a small single-family home, after all). But the Wrangler’s on-road behavior is dramatically better than it used to be and is no longer a reason for shoppers to disqualify it from consideration.\n\nTowing ability might be, however. The two-door Wrangler is rated to tow just 2,000 pounds, the four-door 3,500 pounds. That means a pair of personal watercraft for the two-door and maybe a small pop-up camper for the four-door. Anything more than that wouldn’t be safe.\n\nFuel economy is rated better than the outgoing model, but not much. Only the 3.6-liter V-6 will be available when the Wrangler goes on sale, with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder a late arrival in 2018. For the V-6, the official EPA rating is 18/23/20 mpg for the automatic transmission regardless of two- or four-door model, while the manual transmission version is rated at 17/25/20 mpg for the two-door and 17/23/19 mpg for the four-door. My week with a manual transmission two-door Rubicon model returned an average of 16 mpg, more on par with the outgoing 2017 model. A brief drive of the four-door 2.0-liter Sahara model returned an mpg number in the high 20s driving around town, and if that proves to be accurate, it will be a massive improvement from the old Wrangler V-6 powertrain.\n\nStill Climbs Like a Champ\n\nDespite the on-road improvements, the Wrangler has lost none of its off-road prowess. While models like the Sahara are tuned more for on-road driving with their all-season tires, the Rubicons are still pure rock crawlers. Featuring new heavy-duty Dana axles, electronic locking front and rear differentials, improved crawl ratios for either manual or automatic transmissions, and new BFGoodrich All-Terrain tires, there’s little that can stop the Rubicon: My test loop included an off-road portion in both two- and four-door versions over massive boulders, steep grades and slippery rock surfaces — all of which the Rubicons handled with nary a complaint. Underbody skid-plate protection is standard on the Jeep Rubicon, as are side rock rails, and both received some scraping thanks to the “most aggressive off-road course we’ve ever set up for a demo,” according to Jeep Jamboree staff on-hand at the Wrangler’s launch event.\n\nWhat makes the Jeep Wrangler unique these days is that the SUV does what it does mechanically — there’s no “rock/mud/sand” setting for the Wrangler, merely a part-time four-wheel-drive system that you shift into yourself, a low-range that you engage when you need to, locking differentials that lock when you tell them to. Unlike the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, the technology controlling the vehicle’s four-wheel-drive system is the gray meat between your ears — the Jeep Wrangler is a tool meant for drivers who know what they’re doing off-road, and as such, isn’t appropriate for the average amateur. That said, there is a new feature for the Wrangler in 2018 on the Sahara model: a new full-time four-wheel-drive mode that constantly sends power to both axles as needed, letting drivers select a “set it and forget it” mode. (The part-time 4WD must be turned off on dry pavement to prevent driveline binding.) This will be far more useful to people who want extra traction on-road, but it doesn’t sacrifice the dual-range transfer case or 4WD Low setting.\n\nFar Easier to Use\n\nThe interior might be the biggest change from the old Jeep Wrangler. The dash is more horizontally oriented, and much more expensive-feeling materials adorn the entire cabin. Controls are completely revised and now in line with the rest of the Jeep showroom, right down to the new availability of an 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen, one of three multimedia center options. The overhauled gauge cluster features easy-to-read gauges and a new digital display between them — but the display has an issue: If you’re over 5-foot-10, the top half-inch of the display will be obscured by the gauge hood even with the seat at its lowest setting, meaning you’re losing the compass, outside temperature display and menu headings. It seems that the seats have been raised and cannot be lowered to the extent of the previous model’s. This makes it awkward for taller drivers, obscuring the view upwards out of the windshield. That’s the only blemish on what has become an inviting, well-laid-out and attractive interior. It builds big-time on the Jeep heritage in there, with added premium details throughout (look at the industrial artistry of the manual transmission’s shifter, for instance).\n\nBackseat comfort has gotten a lot of attention, as well. There are now climate control vents for the backseat passengers in the four-door, as well as USB ports and cupholders in the backseat armrest. The rear seatback also reclines at a more natural angle, and there’s about an inch more legroom. While it’s still a small seat with a short cushion, it’s now a much more tolerable place than it has been.\n\nThe Wrangler’s biggest improvement may be the operation of the convertible tops, of which there are several: the Sunrider soft top, the three-piece hard Freedom Top and a new power-actuated Sky One-Touch top that’s a combination of both. The soft top is a completely new design that eliminates all the infuriating zippers. It’s a four-piece affair, with the rear and sides removable via channel sliders and snap-fit attachments that include integrated pillars in the side panels. Take off the back and sides, and the top acts as a boating-style Bimini top. It folds down and to the rear with just a few clicks and a yank, and goes up just as easily. It should take all the apprehension out of lowering the Wrangler’s top and is the result of Jeep listening to owners who said they never put the top down due to the complexity of the process.\n\nThe now-lighter hardtop is the least changed from the previous model — it operates mostly as before, but the front two panels are removable with just a few latches (the difficult hand bolts are gone), and the back part is removable with several Torx-head bolts.\n\nThe most intriguing new top is the Sky One-Touch power top, available only on the four-door. It’s essentially a full-length powered sliding canvas sunroof with a fixed rear window and removable rigid side quarter panels. At the touch of a button, it slides open or closed at speeds up to 60 mph. Open the back doors and flip two levers, and the side panels come out, ready to be carefully stored in the cargo area. It’s simple to use, seems tight and quiet at highway speeds, and allows for super-quick transitions from enclosed SUV to open-air one. I expect it’s going to be a very popular (and expensive) option.\n\nAll of the Modern Amenities\n\nA new vehicle means a new electrical architecture, and Jeep made the most of it with the Wrangler. Finally, the Uconnect multimedia system arrives in the Wrangler — the latest generation of it, too, which is FCA’s best. It’s clear, it’s reconfigurable and it’s even easy to see in bright sunlight, which is important in a vehicle that has a removable top and doors. There are only four airbags available, but they’re standard now — two in the dash and two “pelvic-thorax” airbags in the front seat sides (suggesting that they provide no side-impact head protection). Overhead bags are not available, because where would you put them? What is available is a new suite of safety systems, including blind spot detection, a standard backup camera, parking sensors and rear cross-traffic alert. Forward collision alert and autonomous braking are not yet available.\n\nNo Surprise: It Didn’t Get Any Cheaper\n\nI’d like to personally thank the Jeep sales and marketing team for protecting the resale value of my own 2015 Wrangler by pricing the new 2018 in such a way that old ones are still going to retain ridiculous value. In other words, the new one gets a hefty price jump: The base two-door Sport starts at $28,190 including a sizeable $1,195 destination fee, representing a $3,100 jump over the outgoing base two-door. The Rubicon two-door starts at $38,190, a $3,450 jump over the outgoing model. The four-door Sport starts at $31,690, a $2,700 jump over the old base model Unlimited Sport. The new 2018 Sahara four-door checks in at $38,540 (a jump of $3,200), while the top-spec Rubicon four-door is now $41,690 to start, an increase of $3,150.\n\nDespite the average $3,120 price increase depending on trim level, the new Jeep Wrangler’s refinements and newfound user-friendliness are still set to make it as popular as ever. Add the new powertrains, expected improved fuel efficiency, more top options, refined interior appointments and more civilized daily-driver suitability, and the new JL Wrangler looks set to keep its iconic status — and huge customer demand.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2008 about the 2008 Jeep Wrangler. This year’s Wrangler gets standard Hill Start Assist. To see what else is new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nJust as Jeep has expanded its lineup, it’s also expanded its classic Wrangler. It gains two more doors, better road manners and more creature comforts, but remains a capable offroad vehicle.\n\nWhat’s good about the Jeep is its cargo area, offroad capability and Spartan interior, plus the fact that it’s unique. What’s bad about this Jeep is that it comes with a variety of interior features that might discourage some from really getting it dirty.\n\nExterior\nThe Unlimited is longer — almost 10 inches longer — than the regular Wrangler; two extra doors will do that to a car. It doesn’t look unnaturally long or oddly proportioned, though, which is interesting because it’s only about a quarter-inch wider than the two-door version. Usually when a car gets longer but not wider it looks goofy, but the Wrangler doesn’t. Thanks to the standard offroad tires on our Rubicon model, though, it rides quite high.\n\nTraditional Jeep styling remains. The grille has the same seven slots as the two-door model, and the fenders flare widely out from the sides. Our test vehicle came with a soft-top and the subsequent array of zippers required to remove it. That zip-off roof is probably the feature that most clearly says “Wrangler”; thanks to consistent rain, I never had a chance to drop the top, but it’s the same multi-step process Wrangler devotees are used to.\n\nInterior\nAs with past Wranglers, the Unlimited values function over form. It’s not designed to be a luxury car, so there’s a fair bit of exposed metal. The interior surfaces are all hard to the touch, to facilitate cleanup.\n\nThe seats are supportive and height-adjustable. As is the case in the two-door Wrangler, there is no dead pedal (an area to the left of the gas and brake pedals) to rest your foot on while driving. Other reviewers have complained about this, but I got used to it after a couple hours on the highway.\n\nOne of the things older Jeeps have is a rough-and-ready interior you can hose out when you’re done playing — heck, they even put drain plugs in the floor. To keep it contemporary, they also put a navigation system and hard drive in ours, so be careful where you point that hose. In fact, our test model came with a carpet, and finding the drain hole proved impossible for me. Maybe it was there, but if it was I would have needed to cut a hole in the carpet to be sure. It may be a Wrangler, but I wouldn’t suggest trying to hose this model out.\n\nThe extra length is more noticeable inside. Rear seat space is OK, but the cargo area is huge. I used it to donate some clothes and kitchen items to charity, then later put my bike, tent and sleeping bag in it, and it carried a surprising amount of cargo. The charity items included about nine 18-by-12-by-10-inch boxes, and the bike was a 58-cm road frame, so we’re not talking about a bunch of tiny things. Cargo capacity with all the seats in place is 46.4 cu. ft., larger than the Nissan Xterra’s 35.2 cu. ft. and the Ford Escape’s 29.2 cu. ft.\n\nThe soft-top can occasionally slap like a sail at highway speeds, but it didn’t happen as consistently in the Wrangler Unlimited as I’ve experienced in older Jeeps. If that bothers you, there’s a hardtop version of the Unlimited that solves that problem.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Jeep felt pretty pokey, both when driving around the city and especially when on the highway. That’s partly because of the combination of slow accelerator response and a four-speed automatic transmission. The thing is, the 3.8-liter V-6 makes 202 horsepower and 237 pounds-feet of torque, so there is muscle there, it’s just not very quick off the line or when passing at highway speeds. The transmission takes a second to kick down, and when it does there’s still more noise than acceleration.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited gets the same mileage estimates as the two-door version, and it’s not great: 15/19 mpg city/highway. Those estimates were consistent with my experience, but again, I didn’t drop the top. I should also note that I tend to get better mileage than most of my driving friends.\n\nThere are four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, and I found stopping performance to be strong, predictable and easy to modulate. That’s a nice thing to have in a vehicle that probably shouldn’t be storming down highway off-ramps.\n\nRide & Handling\nI stuck to pavement for the majority of my drive, so I can’t speak to the Wrangler Unlimited’s credibility as an offroad vehicle. One thing that did surprise me was how nice the ride was. It made short work of the absolutely terrible roads here in Chicago and was comfortable at speed on the highway. There was some wandering from side to side, but it didn’t bounce up and down like a porpoise, as older CJ-Series Jeeps did.\n\nThe handling was also just OK, but you have to remember that this is a vehicle designed for offroad service. You don’t want to take it to a slalom course. One thing that stood out to me and another reviewer was a large amount of play in the steering wheel. The Wrangler Unlimited lacks the pinpoint response of other vehicles, but I got used to it.\n\nOverall, it’s a vehicle that demands you pay extra attention to a few things: How fast you’re going, where you are in your lane and what’s going on around you when you’re on the highway. That’s not necessarily a bad thing if you’re an experienced driver, just know that this car demands more attention than many other cars out there.\n\nFeatures\nWhat did our rough, tough, rock-bashing machine come with as far as options? A navigation system and the optional Infinity sound system. The navigation system was nice, though I believe I’m in the minority in preferring a knob-based system to this model’s touch-screen interface.\n\nI didn’t like the Infinity sound system, but it should be noted I’m not an audiophile. I didn’t notice any need for a boost in sound when cruising at highway speed with the soft-top attached, but I did notice all the room the subwoofer ate up in the cargo area. Maybe with the top removed the extra oomph from the stereo is warranted — and wanted.\n\nA truly nice touch was the YES Essentials odor- and stain-resistant seat material. I didn’t test it extensively, but it’s a nice thing to have when you’re always out working up a sweat.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, our preferred source for crash-test data, ranks the Wrangler Unlimited Good in frontal-offset crash tests. Models without side-impact airbags are rated Marginal in side-impact tests. (The front-seat-mounted side airbags are a $490 option, and the Wrangler Unlimited was not tested with them.) IIHS has not tested the Wrangler Unlimited for rear crash protection.\n\nAll Jeep Wrangler Unlimiteds come with antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nWrangler Unlimited in the Market\nThe Wrangler Unlimited — all Wranglers, really — hold a rare space in the market. There aren’t too many vehicles that let you zip off the top, cruise campus, then go climb a mud wall. For some, those abilities — and its cool factor — forgive all other Wrangler sins. The fact that Wrangler drivers can now more comfortably carry more passengers and gear is just all the better.\n\nThis car is an offroad niche vehicle, and it’s hard to find fault with how it fills that niche. It’s when the Wrangler Unlimited is compared to other small SUV — most notably car-based models — that you start to notice some shortcomings. It’s not particularly easy to load stuff into, thanks to a high load floor and a swing-out rear gate that makes loading items a pain. The mileage isn’t great, and our test vehicle — while loaded with some nice things — stickered at $34,290.\n\nIn the end, I think you have to be honest with yourself before you decide to buy this car. Do you have a real need to go off-road? Do you regularly carry big, bulky items? Is it OK if you’re not pampered all the time? If so, the Wrangler Unlimited is worth considering and saving up for — it’s designed to fill that niche. But if you need a car for a long highway commute, that’s not the niche the Wrangler Unlimited is really best at filling. If you do decide to go that route, just be prepared to make tradeoffs in mileage, high-speed stability in turns and a lack of luxury in the cabin.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — It used to be that the idea of buying a Wrangler was always tempered by “yeah, buts.” “Yeah, it looks like a lot of fun, but I have a family.” So Jeep added a four-door model in 2007. “Yeah, I can take more people now, but the powertrain is terrible.” So Jeep gave it a new engine for 2012. “Yeah, it’s smoother and more powerful now, but it’s awful on-road.”\n\nRelated: Wrangler Wroundup: Everything We Know About the 2018 Jeep Wrangler\n\nNo more “yeah, buts” for the Wrangler with this all-new 2018 redesign, which is scheduled to hit dealerships in January. The new Wrangler “JL” has been thoroughly reworked from the ground up, and the guys in charge of doing it are themselves Jeep fans who interact frequently with die-hard, loyal Wrangler owners and enthusiasts. They had a list of more than 30 items that needed redoing, according to Wrangler’s chief engineer. The team set about refining and redesigning the icon without reimagining it. The Wrangler’s mission remains as it was: to be the most capable, go-anywhere off-road vehicle that is still affordable and everyday-usable. With the last of the “yeah, buts” removed, the Wrangler now comes with a hefty dose of refinement inside and out, making it a more civilized, more approachable vehicle than ever before.\n\nVery Wrangler to Look At\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking not much has changed, stylistically. But you’d be wrong — park the new JL side by side with the old JK, and you’ll realize that it’s considerably revised. The front end is smoother and higher, with taller fenders and a more trapezoidal shape to the grille. The windshield is also more raked and flatter than before — meaning it sits more level with the hood if you fold it down, which is easier than ever to do: Removing just four bolts at the top of the windshield, plus yanking off the wiper arms, allows you to tilt the windshield frame forward against the hood and secure it with a provided strap. This gives new meaning to the idea of open-air motoring, but it also is something of a mixed blessing.\n\nI drove the new Wrangler off-road, up some steep rocky inclines, with the windshield down and didn’t care for the lack of glass in front of me. The problem: It adds a good 4 to 5 inches to the hood’s height, making visibility off-road even more difficult. In areas where seeing over the hood is most important, you’ll want to leave the windshield in place.\n\nThere are optional LED headlights for Sahara and Rubicon trim levels, optional LED taillights and standard LED turn signals in the fenders. Those fenders are now an inch higher to allow buyers to mount 33-inch tires without needing to install a lift kit — Rubicon fenders are higher still, allowing for 35-inch optional tires without a lift kit.\n\nThe new Wrangler comes in fewer trim levels: base Sport, nicer Sport S and rock-crawling Rubicon for the two-door. The four-door Wrangler, no longer called Unlimited, adds the more luxurious Sahara between the Sport S and Rubicon.\n\nVery Un-Wrangler to Drive\n\nClimb up into the taller driver’s seat (an inch higher than the old one) and push the new standard starter button to fire up one of two engines available at launch: A carryover 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, making 285 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, will be familiar to any Fiat Chrysler Automobiles fans, although it now features a standard stop-start fuel-saver system. It’s mated to either a vastly improved six-speed manual transmission, which no longer rattles and vibrates the shifter as it trundles along, or a new optional eight-speed automatic that’s also out of FCA’s corporate parts bin. The optional engine on the two-door or four-door is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder light hybrid engine. It uses what is essentially a heavy-duty 48-volt alternator that’s attached to the crankshaft via a belt, which aids in low-speed initial starts and other conditions to improve fuel economy. The turbo four is only available mated to the automatic transmission. A turbocharged 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 is coming, but not until the 2019 model year.\n\nI sampled both powertrains in my drive in, over, around and through the wilds of Tucson, Ariz., and found the V-6 to be adequately smooth and powerful. But the new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is even better. Mated only to the automatic transmission, it makes 270 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque but feels amazingly torquey, punchy and quick around town. I drove a four-door model loaded up with a hardtop, three full-size humans and a lot of camera gear, and the turbo engine felt responsive and zippy, with the eight-speed auto shifting seamlessly and smoothly through the gears. Only on some low-speed corners did I find it in a gear lower than I wanted, but the transmission’s quick-shifting nature and utter lack of turbo lag poured on speed with remarkable ease. As much as the addition of the 3.6-liter Pentastar engine transformed the Wrangler into a usable daily-driver in 2012, that’s how much better the new 2.0-liter is for 2018.\n\nRide and handling have also received a massive shot in the arm thanks to a revised suspension, wider axles, improved tires and a new electrohydraulic steering system (with an electric motor-driven pump). The Wrangler still drives like a light truck — you won’t confuse this for a car-based Toyota RAV4 or Jeep’s own Cherokee — but no longer does it feel ponderous or sloppy around turns. The Sport and Sahara models were well-controlled, provided acceptable steering feedback and even had a decently comfortable ride over rough pavement. It feels like a modern mid-size pickup truck, such as a Chevrolet Colorado or Toyota Tacoma, in that it’s no longer a penalty box, but it’s still not quite the smooth and well-damped environment of a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Only so much can be done to hide the fact that there are still two solid live axles front and rear, and in stiff crosswinds you’ll still get blown all over the highway (you are driving something with the aerodynamic profile of a small single-family home, after all). But the Wrangler’s on-road behavior is dramatically better than it used to be and is no longer a reason for shoppers to disqualify it from consideration.\n\nTowing ability might be, however. The two-door Wrangler is rated to tow just 2,000 pounds, the four-door 3,500 pounds. That means a pair of personal watercraft for the two-door and maybe a small pop-up camper for the four-door. Anything more than that wouldn’t be safe.\n\nAs for fuel economy, the jury is still out. Jeep didn’t have official numbers or estimates at the time of the vehicle’s launch, but we expect to see those numbers soon. Unofficially, I was returning an mpg number in the high 20s driving a 2.0-liter four-door around town, and if that proves to be accurate, it will be a massive improvement from the old Wrangler.\n\nStill Climbs Like a Champ\n\nDespite the on-road improvements, the Wrangler has lost none of its off-road prowess. While models like the Sahara are tuned more for on-road driving with their all-season tires, the Rubicons are still pure rock crawlers. Featuring new heavy-duty Dana axles, electronic locking front and rear differentials, improved crawl ratios for either manual or automatic transmissions, and new BFGoodrich All-Terrain tires, there’s little that can stop the Rubicon: My test loop included an off-road portion in both two- and four-door versions over massive boulders, steep grades and slippery rock surfaces — all of which the Rubicons handled with nary a complaint. Underbody skid-plate protection is standard on the Rubicon, as are side rock rails, and both received some scraping thanks to the “most aggressive off-road course we’ve ever set up for a demo,” according to Jeep Jamboree staff on-hand at the Wrangler’s launch event.\n\nWhat makes the Wrangler unique these days is that the SUV does what it does mechanically — there’s no “rock/mud/sand” setting for the Wrangler, merely a part-time four-wheel-drive system that you shift into yourself, a low-range that you engage when you need to, locking differentials that lock when you tell them to. Unlike the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, the technology controlling the vehicle’s four-wheel-drive system is the gray meat between your ears — the Wrangler is a tool meant for drivers who know what they’re doing off-road, and as such, isn’t appropriate for the average amateur. That said, there is a new feature for the Wrangler in 2018 on the Sahara model: a new full-time four-wheel-drive mode that constantly sends power to both axles as needed, letting drivers select a “set it and forget it” mode. (The part-time 4WD must be turned off on dry pavement to prevent driveline binding.) This will be far more useful to people who want extra traction on-road, but it doesn’t sacrifice the dual-range transfer case or 4WD Low setting.\n\nFar Easier to Use\n\nThe interior might be the biggest change from the old Wrangler. The dash is more horizontally oriented, and much more expensive-feeling materials adorn the entire cabin. Controls are completely revised and now in line with the rest of the Jeep showroom, right down to the new availability of an 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen, one of three multimedia center options. The overhauled gauge cluster features easy-to-read gauges and a new digital display between them — but the display has an issue: If you’re over 5-foot-10, the top half-inch of the display will be obscured by the gauge hood even with the seat at its lowest setting, meaning you’re losing the compass, outside temperature display and menu headings. That’s the only blemish on what has become an inviting, well-laid-out and attractive interior. It builds big-time on the Jeep heritage in there, with added premium details throughout (look at the industrial artistry of the manual transmission’s shifter, for instance).\n\nBackseat comfort has gotten a lot of attention, as well. There are now climate control vents for the backseat passengers in the four-door, as well as USB ports and cupholders in the backseat armrest. The rear seatback also reclines at a more natural angle, and there’s about an inch more legroom. While it’s still a small seat with a short cushion, it’s now a much more tolerable place than it has been.\n\nThe Wrangler’s biggest improvement may be the operation of the convertible tops, of which there are several: the Sunrider soft top, the three-piece hard Freedom Top and a new power-actuated Sky One-Touch top that’s a combination of both.\n\nThe soft top is a completely new design that eliminates all the infuriating zippers. It’s a four-piece affair, with the rear and sides removable via channel sliders and snap-fit attachments that include integrated pillars in the side panels. Take off the back and sides, and the top acts as a boating-style Bimini top. It folds down and to the rear with just a few clicks and a yank, and goes up just as easily. It should take all the apprehension out of lowering the Wrangler’s top and is the result of Jeep listening to owners who said they never put the top down due to the complexity of the process.\n\nThe now-lighter hardtop is the least changed from the previous model — it operates mostly as before, but the front two panels are removable with just a few latches (the difficult hand-bolts are gone), and the back part is removable with several Torx-head bolts.\n\nThe most intriguing new top is the Sky One-Touch power top, available only on the four-door. It’s essentially a full-length powered sliding canvas sunroof with a fixed rear window and removable rigid side quarter panels. At the touch of a button, it slides open or closed at speeds up to 60 mph. Open the back doors and flip two levers, and the side panels come out, ready to be carefully stored in the cargo area. It’s simple to use, seems tight and quiet at highway speeds, and allows for super-quick transitions from enclosed SUV to open-air one. I expect it’s going to be a very popular (and expensive) option.\n\nAll of the Modern Amenities\n\nA new vehicle means a new electrical architecture, and Jeep made the most of it with the Wrangler. Finally, the Uconnect multimedia system arrives in the Wrangler — the latest generation of it, too, which is FCA’s best. It’s clear, it’s reconfigurable and it’s even easy to see in bright sunlight, which is important in a vehicle that has a removable top and doors. There are only four airbags available, but they’re standard now — two in the dash and two “pelvic-thorax” airbags in the front seat sides (suggesting that they provide no side-impact head protection). Overhead bags are not available, because where would you put them? What is available is a new suite of safety systems, including blind spot detection, a standard backup camera, parking sensors and rear cross-traffic alert. Forward collision alert and autonomous braking are not yet available.\n\nSurprise: It Didn’t Get Any Cheaper\n\nI’d like to personally thank the Jeep sales and marketing team for protecting the resale value of my own 2015 Wrangler by pricing the new 2018 in such a way that old ones are still going to retain ridiculous value. In other words, the new one gets a hefty price jump: The base two-door Sport starts at $28,190 including a sizeable $1,195 destination fee, representing a $3,100 jump over the outgoing base two-door. The Rubicon two-door starts at $38,190, a $3,450 jump over the outgoing model. The four-door Sport starts at $31,690, a $2,700 jump over the old base model Unlimited Sport. The new 2018 Sahara four-door checks in at $38,540 (a jump of $3,200), while the top-spec Rubicon four-door is now $41,690 to start, an increase of $3,150.\n\nDespite the average $3,120 price increase depending on trim level, the new Wrangler’s refinements and newfound user-friendliness are still set to make it as popular as ever. Add the new powertrains, expected improved fuel efficiency, more top options, refined interior appointments and more civilized daily-driver suitability, and the new Wrangler JL looks set to keep its iconic status — and huge customer demand.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If the Donner Party had Jeeps, they never would have found themselves on the menu.\n\nJeeps can eat up just about any trail.\n\nDuring a recent rock crawl through Utah, the state where the actual Donner wagon train hit its first delay of many on the move west, the Jeeps never got stuck. The complete Jeep lineup from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee made child’s play of rocks, ridgelines and mountain passes.\n\nMy particular test vehicle, the new and improved 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, never stalled, stuttered or paused at any big boulder challenge in front of it. It was almost stoic as it glided up rock faces or down potential disasters for other vehicles. Four-wheel low gobbles up tough terrain, leaving any driver feeling as if he can conquer anything.\n\nMore importantly, the Wrangler Unlimited has been spruced up with a major interior overhaul that should appeal to people whose toughest off-road test is a two-track to the family cabin. The idea is pretty straightforward and somewhat the same as when Jeep introduced the Wrangler more than 20 years ago and the Unlimited five years ago: Attract more customers.\n\nThe Unlimited arrived in 2007 as the four-door, long wheelbase Wrangler. Most people at the time said, “Duh, where has this been?” It opened up a whole new market to Jeep enthusiasts who grew up and got themselves a family. The two-door Wrangler, while iconic and fun, could do just about everything but carry more than two adults. The Unlimited changed that.\n\nComfort had been issue\n\nAnd while every Jeep nearly lived up to its long-built reputation for off-road prowess, its interiors lacked the comfort and completeness it should have. The plastic was hard, the features sparse. Roughing it may come into play in the wilderness, but it shouldn’t on your commute to work or grocery getting, or cruising along on the highway. We’re a spoiled bunch nowadays and for most of us, roughing it is when the cable goes out during a lightning storm.\n\nSo the interior was rebuilt with a new instrument panel, new seats and a much cleaner look with upgrades in materials and fit and finish.\n\nThe work pays dividends.\n\nThere are new comfort features, such as heated seats, and cosmetic additions, such as new instrument gauges. There are also new storage spaces and a lockable center console, which is handy when the top is down (taking the cloth top down is still difficult, though; it requires two people and a good five minutes to unzip, unsnap and pop out the different brackets and holders).\n\nOther new features, such as the 115-volt outlet, was a true Godsend during the trip as every camera in Utah needs to be recharged often because everywhere you turn is another postcard shot.\n\nThe combination of practicality and sophistication bodes well with the Unlimited.\n\nThe current U-Connect system, which Jeep will upgrade to the next generation in the coming years, is still behind other competitors. The USB connection mounts on the face of the stereo instead of in a more reasonable location, such as the center console or the base of the center stack. Additionally, the Unlimited I tested could not play music directly off my iPhone4. I had to plug the USB cable into the phone and then run an auxiliary cable from the phone to the stereo. It makes the front of the stereo in the Jeep look like the back of my stereo at home, which no one should have to look at.\n\nSo is the interior improved? Absolutely. It just feels cleaner, well built and complete. And while it will easily carry four adults comfortably to the opera or other city activity, the Unlimited felt more at home with its interior covered in red dust. And if you don’t need the second row for people, the seats fold up nicely and create 86.75 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nSmooth, quiet ride\n\nBut most people won’t get out into the wild with the Unlimited and they’ll enjoy it just the same on the highway. Jeep added a few acoustic improvements to make the ride quieter, though those are difficult tests when the roof down.\n\nThe ride, however, is surprisingly smooth on the highway. The 3.8-liter V-6 engine produces 202 horsepower and 237 pound-feet of torque, which is more than enough power on any surface. The gas mileage is nothing great ? though considering the Unlimited’s abilities, it’s pretty good at 15 mpg city and 19 mpg highway. Scale a mountain and it’s likely to be a little worse.\n\nBut where the Unlimited lives, mileage is not the most important feature. There is a reason there are three skid plates on this Jeep rocks can do all kinds of damage to the transfer case, gas tank and transmission oil pan.\n\nThe Rubicon model I tested, which includes a two-speed transfer case and front and rear axle lockers, electronic sway bar disconnect and 32-inch off-road tires, should only be bought by someone who intends to ride on a lot of roads less traveled.\n\nThe front lockers turn this vehicle into a bulldozer, ready to climb through almost anything. (Really, few people “need” this kind of capability, though Jeep will sell you one just in case you think you “need” one.)\n\nReally, though, Jeep says something few other vehicles can. It projects a lifestyle. Few vehicles can be identified by their brand name as easily as the Jeep Wrangler.\n\nPeople who know nothing about cars or trucks know a Jeep and could pick one out in a parking lot long before they remember the Lexus RX400h is the hybrid version. Many little boys are known to have a Jeep gene, which tests their ability to try and break every toy they own.\n\nAnd the Unlimited manages to add two doors and still keep all of its iconic looks without sacrificing its abilities. Those big round headlights, the seven slotted grille, the big wheels and high ride all remain.\n\nThe Unlimited can do nearly anything a two-door Wrangler can manage.\n\nBut it’s just a little bit nicer.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: *** 1/2\n\nExterior: Excellent\nIconic and easily identifiable.

      "expert_review": "Several words describe the Jeep Wrangler: boxy, iconic, fun, capable. But a word I wouldn’t associate with Jeep’s off-road specialist is efficient. The Wrangler has always suffered in the fuel economy department in part because it’s hard to make a brick aerodynamic. That, however, is about to change for the 2020 Wrangler four-door, called the Unlimited, which adds a diesel powertrain as an option that delivers big gains in fuel economy and torque.\n\nRelated: 2020 Jeep Wrangler Adding Diesel Engine Option to Four-Door Models\n\nThe diesel joins the turbocharged four-cylinder and V-6 gasoline engines to give the Wrangler Unlimited three engine options. Jeep plans to offer the diesel only on the Unlimited for now, so those who want two doors will have to stick with the gas engines.\n\nI took a trip to Zion National Park in Utah to test out a pair of Wrangler Unlimiteds with the new powertrain to see what it might change, fuel economy aside. I spent time in both the street-friendly Sahara and the off-road-specialist Rubicon on pavement, and the Rubicon on a robust off-road course. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own transportation and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nHefty Powertrain\n\nThe turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 produces 260 horsepower and 442 pounds-feet of torque, which is a big helping of additional torque. That figure far bests the numbers from the gasoline engines, which make 260 pounds-feet (V-6) and 295 pounds-feet (turbo four), respectively. The diesel is also paired with a reworked eight-speed automatic transmission designed to handle the extra torque.\n\nThe diesel engine is very similar to the one found in the Ram 1500, having virtually identical hardware, though some of it has been moved around in the Wrangler to accommodate its off-road needs. For example, the alternator has been moved to the top of the engine so the Wrangler’s fording depth can remain the same.\n\nChecking the box for the diesel adds two kinds of heft to the Wrangler Unlimited: about 400 pounds of weight and $4,000 to the price tag (in addition to $2,000 for the automatic transmission, because the manual isn’t offered). According to Jeep, the 400-pound gain is in comparison to both the gas four-cylinder and V-6 (somehow those two engines weigh the same), and most of that weight comes from the engine itself. But if you take a peek below the Wrangler Unlimited, you’ll see some extra skid plates to protect  the water/fuel separator and diesel exhaust fluid tanks. Sound deadening was also added around the engine bay to try to keep the diesel growl out of the cabin.\n\nJeep also made suspension changes to help account for the added weight, increasing the shock tuning and spring rates on EcoDiesel models. It’s those changes that seem to change the Wrangler’s road manners the most with this engine.\n\nResearch the 2020 Jeep Wrangler now.\n\nOn the Road\n\nRegardless of engine, there’s a fair bit of difference between the Sahara and the Rubicon on pavement. It’s usually favorable in the direction of the Sahara with its street-oriented tires versus the knobby all-terrain tires found on the Rubicon. In this case, however, given the changes to the suspension, I actually found the opposite to be true.\n\nWe’ve highlighted this JL generation of the Wrangler’s much improved ride quality, particularly in the longer-wheelbase Unlimited models. The EcoDiesel seems to roll back that positivity. The suspension tweaks designed to better handle the added weight produce a ride that feels brittle on the road, as if the Wrangler has just awakened and its joints are creaky.\n\nThis is especially true in the Sahara, which feels busy as the front chatters along, highlighting any imperfections in the pavement. The Wrangler’s nose also feels noticeably heavier under braking and turning, which takes away some handling confidence. These changes give the advantage on the road to the Rubicon, where its larger, knobby tires seem to do a better job of smoothing the ride out, making it feel closer to the gas versions than the Sahara does. I admit I did not see that coming.\n\nThough the ride disappoints, the diesel engine itself does not. Maximum torque is available starting at 1,400 rpm, and good off-the-line responsiveness reflects that. The power delivery is smooth and easy to control, there isn’t much jumpiness to the throttle, and it’s easy to pull the exact amount of acceleration you want. The engine also offers consistent performance at speed; some diesel engines struggle to provide even passing power, but there are no such problems here.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of engine noise, which overwhelms the added sound deadening around the engine compartment and fills the cabin with that unpleasant, grainy diesel sound anytime you start to press on the throttle. It was so loud that my drive partner and I quickly got accustomed to waiting for the engine to finish accelerating to continue our conversation. This forms a weird contrast with the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel, which has a roughly identical engine but a very quiet cabin that filters all of that noise out. From the outside, the two engines have roughly the same loudness when idling next to each other, so it’s curious that it would feel so much more overbearing in the Wrangler.\n\nJeep has stated that the EcoDiesel will have a range of “over 500 miles” with its 18.3-gallon fuel tank. Fuel economy estimates from the EPA are not yet available, but over a 104-mile drive loop of mostly highway, the Wrangler’s trip computer reported 31.2 mpg. Even if you take that figure with a grain of salt, that’s a significant jump over the highway mpg number for the gasoline engines — 22 mpg for both the V-6 and the turbocharged four-cylinder (with the automatic transmission).\n\nFind a 2020 Jeep Wrangler near you.\n\nOff the Road\n\nThis portion of the testing was where I most feared for the diesel engine for a couple of reasons. First, when driving off-road, throttle dexterity takes on premium importance, especially if you’re doing any kind of rock crawling, and the off-road course contained two or three tricky crawl sections. Second, I thought that the added poundage might have a detrimental impact on the Wrangler’s mobility.\n\nSo, with the tires aired down to 20 pounds per square inch for some added traction, I set out in a Rubicon EcoDiesel to see if my fears were misplaced — and they were. The EcoDiesel remains a fantastic off-road vehicle. The throttle mapping with four-wheel drive in 4-Low or in 4-High is spot on. You have use of all of that yummy torque, but it’s easy to modulate the throttle to get the exact amount you want. With maximum torque kicking in so early, I was wary of jerkiness from going just a bit too far on the accelerator pedal, but that wasn’t the case. This aspect of the powertrain was nearly telepathic.\n\nMy second fear was also misplaced. The added weight is no match for the added torque from the engine, and the Wrangler was as easy to manipulate as ever. From a steering and balance perspective, there was no discernible difference between the gasoline versions and the diesel. And that extra torque with the even delivery arguably gives the EcoDiesel a better experience after the pavement ends.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nJeep, Ram Diesel Emissions Scandal: What Owners Need to Know\nAll the Pickup Truck News: 2021 Chevy Colorado, Ram EcoDiesel MPG, Dirt on the 2020 Tacoma and More\nFord Bronco Bustin’ Outta the Corral at Last\n2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review: Good Old Dog Running Out of Tricks\n2020 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon EcoDiesel | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nAt What Cost\n\nThere’s no way around it: Adding the diesel engine is expensive. If you were going to get an automatic gasoline-powered model, it’s an extra $4,000, but if you’re jumping up from the manual transmission, you tack on another $2,000 for the mandatory eight-speed automatic. To make up that difference in price with the added fuel economy gains of the diesel, if it comes at all, would take a long time considering that diesel is currently more expensive than the regular fuel the gasoline engines use (the turbocharged four-cylinder will run on regular fine, though Jeep recommends premium for maximum performance).\n\nI’m glad to see the EcoDiesel will be available across all Wrangler Unlimited trim levels, which means the cheapest version you can get will be a Sport model with only the diesel and automatic checked, and that costs $39,200 (including destination charges). The vehicles I tested, however, were nowhere close to that: $55,125 for the Sahara and $63,145 for the Rubicon.\n\nThe good news, though, is that if your heart is set on the diesel, it does seem to offer significant range and efficiency advantages, and the Wrangler’s off-road capability carries on uncompromised — not to mention all of that added torque, which makes for easy acceleration. But the drawbacks in noise, ride quality and price also make it difficult for me to say that the EcoDiesel is better, just different.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited EcoDiesel is available for order now and will arrive in dealerships starting in December.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nRecent upgrades make the 2013 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hardtop is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Wrangler Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions (Sahara and Rubicon), the fender flares and removable hardtop are body-colored.\n\nChanges for 2013 include redesigned seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, new wheel designs for Rubicon and Sahara trim levels, an optional Alpine premium stereo and a new optional premium soft-top that has nicer material than the regular top and three layers for better noise isolation. See the 2012 and 2013 models compared here.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Jeep Wrangler comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 engine and five-speed automatic transmission that replaced a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and four-speed in the 2012 model year. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: more power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nThe rough, old 3.8-L V6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe current Wrangler hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts. Both the 2 door and 4 door models get and EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of 18 mpg, though the four-door model does see a 1-mpg improvement over the 2-door body in city driving – 16 mpg vs. the 2-doors 17 mpg.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Wrangler Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus off-road capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (as on the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Jeep Wrangler illustrates the trade-offs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the four-door Jeep Wrangler Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Jeep Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader trade-off, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Jeep Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Jeep Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 21 competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser, are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard anti-lock brakes, an anti-roll electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nOverall, we found the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited accommodates three different types of child-safety seats well. See the Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Jeep Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Jeep Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages …\n\nI’ll buy a Jeep Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Wrangler is to Jeep what bananas are to Chiquita, and that’s something Chrysler’s latest owner, Italian automaker Fiat, has said it won’t meddle with. That’s probably a good thing. Short of a few luxury models, no other SUVs can boast the Wrangler’s off-road chops, and not one can match its outdoorsy versatility. But the other shoe always drops — and in this case it’s a steel-toed boot. With a brick in it. Chucked from a ladder.\n\nThe Wrangler’s off-road capabilities deserve respect, but they come at a high price once you get back to civilization.\n\nThe Lineup\nThe Wrangler is available in two-door Wrangler and four-door Wrangler Unlimited configurations; click here to compare them with the 2009 Wranglers. Both versions offer Sport, Sahara and top-of-the-line Rubicon trim levels. Jeep also added two special editions, the Islander and the Mountain, for 2010. Four-wheel drive is standard on most versions, but the Wrangler Unlimited Sport and Sahara can be had with rear-wheel drive. We drove a four-wheel-drive Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon.\n\nOn the Trail\nJeep’s “Trail Rated” badge, which signals a host of off-road capabilities, seems superfluous here. With locking front and rear axles, a disconnecting front stabilizer bar for additional up-and-down wheel travel, a heavy-duty Dana 44 front axle, and a two-speed transfer case with a 4.0:1 low-range gear ratio, the Wrangler Rubicon blazes trails that would leave other SUVs slipping, stalling or just plain stuck. I took a Rubicon on a serious off-road course a few years back, and it clawed through slop I thought impassable. I’ve driven pickups and SUVs that ground to a halt or dug themselves in when traction gave out at all four wheels, but when you lock the axles via a dashboard button in the Rubicon, it sends mud, sand or rocks flying as all four wheels move in unison. And eventually it moves forward.\n\nIt’s not just equipment that makes the Wrangler so good on the trail. The SUV’s construction — a spare design with short overhangs and a high ride height — makes for easier maneuverability and better clearance. Consider two competitors:\n\nOff-Road Chops Compared\n \tJeep Wrangler 4×4 Unlimited Rubicon\tNissan Xterra 4×4 Off-Road\tToyota FJ Cruiser 4×4 All-Terrain Package\nPrice\t$32,050\t$29,500\t$28,630\nLength (in.)\t173.4\t178.7\t183.9\nWidth (in.)\t73.9\t72.8\t75.0\nMin. ground clearance (in.)\t10.1\t9.5\t9.6\nMax. approach angle (deg.)\t44.4\t33.2\t34.0\nMax. departure angle (deg.)\t40.5\t29.4\t31.0\nTransfer case, low-range ratio\t4.0:1\t2.6:1\t2.6:1\nLocking differentials\tFront and rear\tRear only\tRear only\nSkid plates\tFuel tank, transfer case, oil pan\tFuel tank, transfer case, oil pan\tEngine, transfer case, oil pan\nSource: Automaker data\n\nHard-core off-roaders will want to get the two-door Rubicon. Though its approach and departure angles are similar to the Unlimited’s, the two-door’s 20.6-inch-shorter wheelbase contributes to a higher, 25.2-degree break-over angle than the Unlimited’s 20.8 degrees.\n\nWith either setup, non-Rubicon Wranglers lose the axle lockers and employ 2.72:1 low-range gearing — still respectable — as well as a Dana 30 front axle with a fixed stabilizer bar. They have the same array of underbody skid plates and, depending on the trim, at least 8.7 inches of ground clearance. Even with the Wrangler Sport’s 16-inch wheels and smaller tires, approach and departure angles exceed 37 degrees. Throw in an optional limited-slip rear differential, and I suspect the Sport, Sahara, Islander and Mountain are still capable of some serious off-road shenanigans. (The rear-wheel-drive Sport and Sahara Unlimited, on the other hand, would be able to do little of that.)\n\nOn the Road\nAutomakers are getting better at finding middle ground between the extremes — nimble handling with reasonably good ride comfort, for example. The Wrangler is old-school; it swings unapologetically toward the extreme. The non-independent, solid-axle suspension delivers ride quality reminiscent of trucks in the 1990s. Encounter anything short of glass-smooth interstates, and the Wrangler bounces up and down erratically, barely resettling after one expansion joint before the next one sends it into another tizzy. My Rubicon’s 32-inch BF Goodrich Mud Terrain tires did a decent job masking road noise, but wind noise became intrusive at highway speeds, and any bumps mid-corner sent the Wrangler hopping sideways. With a lighter-duty suspension, other Wranglers likely pack a more controlled ride. If you test-drive the Rubicon back-to-back with one of them, let me know your thoughts.\n\nThe Wrangler’s 3.8-liter pushrod V-6 is old-school, seeing duty in some form through two decades of Chrysler products. Here it’s good for 202 horsepower and 237 pounds-feet of torque — enough power for stop-and-go driving and torque-needy off-road maneuvers. But the Wrangler and its truck-based peers are heavy. My four-wheel-drive Rubicon weighed in at 4,340 pounds; that’s a bit more than the four-wheel-drive FJ Cruiser and nearly 800 pounds more than a loaded Ford Escape or Honda CR-V. Highway acceleration is weak, and the engine sounds coarse when pushed.\n\nA six-speed manual is standard. We drove it in a 2007 Wrangler, the first year of the current generation, and its rubbery throws and heavy clutch are typical of the manual transmissions you’ll find in truck-based SUVs. Our 2010 Wrangler had the optional four-speed automatic. It upshifts smoothly but begs for more gears on the open road; 60-to-70 mph acceleration sends the automatic hunting between 3rd and 2nd gears, underpowered in one and bellowing furiously in the other. Non-Rubicon grades have a lower rear axle ratio — 3.21 or 3.73, to the Rubicon’s 4.1. That could make off-the-line acceleration even worse. Still, the proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is … well, slow. Our friends at “MotorWeek” tested a Wrangler Unlimited Sahara back in 2007, and it loafed to 60 mph in just under 11 seconds.\n\nGiven all that, it’s hard to reconcile the Wrangler’s gas mileage. At 15/19 mpg city/highway with either transmission, the four-wheel-drive Wrangler matches the stick-shift, four-wheel-drive Toyota FJ Cruiser but falls 1 to 2 mpg short of the automatic FJ and all four-wheel-drive versions of the Nissan Xterra. Towing capacity, at 2,000 pounds for the Wrangler and 3,500 pounds for the Wrangler Unlimited, also trails the competition.\n\nTypical of a truck, the Rubicon’s steering is a soupy mess. The wheel requires constant corrections to stay on course on the highway — something you’ll be doing often, as the Wrangler’s aerodynamics fall easy prey to crosswinds. Find a corner, and the vague steering turn-in and excessive body roll add an unsettling degree of uncertainty, even for an SUV. Steering this slow might befit tricky off-road situations, where you don’t want to do anything too suddenly. On the pavement, however, it’s a bane.\n\nUrban weekenders should note that the Wrangler Unlimited’s 41.2-foot turning circle (with 16-inch wheels) will make alley maneuvers and tight angles especially troublesome. The two-door Wrangler’s 34.9-foot circle is a much better fit.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard across the board, but the mushy pedal doesn’t inspire much confidence. Overall stopping power is modest: In “MotorWeek’s” tests, the Wrangler Unlimited required 141 feet to stop from 60 mph. That’s 11 feet longer than it took MotorWeek to stop a three-ton Toyota Sequoia.\n\nInside & Out\nAdventurous drivers will appreciate the Wrangler’s purposeful interior, with straightforward controls and an open, upright design. Cabin materials look ready to withstand dirt and mud, and Jeep says the floor is washable, with removable carpeting and footwell drain plugs. Sahara and Rubicon models have stain-resistant fabric, with two-tone leather optional.\n\nThat aside, a lot of things need work. The front seats provide virtually no lateral support, and the driver’s seat has limited rearward adjustment. I slid it all the way back, and my 5-foot, 11-inch frame could have used a couple more inches of legroom. The standard manual height adjustment jacks the seat up on an incline, so eking out the most legroom means keeping the seat low. A telescoping adjustment for the steering wheel might help more drivers orient themselves, but the Wrangler’s wheel only tilts.\n\nBackseat legroom in the Unlimited is tight, and the two-door Wrangler loses another 1.6 inches. Headroom is adequate, and the backseat sits high enough off the ground that adults’ knees won’t be in the air, but most will find the seat cushions are a few inches too short for adequate thigh support. Though you have to flip the seat cushions forward before putting the seatbacks down — a more involved process than most SUVs require — the Unlimited’s resulting cargo area is tall, and its 86.8 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume is some 20 cubic feet more than that of an FJ or Xterra.\n\nLike the FJ, the Wrangler has a rear swing-gate that extends several feet rearward, rather than the traditional upward-extending liftgate. Some may find it easier to open than a tailgate, but it requires more clearance, particularly when parallel parked. The rear window opens independent of the door, but only after moving the tailgate — and its spare tire — out of the way. Equally annoying: With their detachable hinges, the doors lack any detents to stay in place. Leave an open one unattended, and it drifts freely — and can wander into an adjacent car while you’re attending to groceries or a child. I came inches from experiencing this while unloading a few bags. Expletives ensued, of course.\n\nThe removable doors augment the Wrangler’s convertible nature, though we don’t recommend driving one that way regularly, as the doors will help protect you in a side impact. Standard equipment includes Jeep’s Sunrider soft-top, which is easier to use this year thanks to a new cable system that eliminates the need to futz with the side rails. A fold-down windshield is also standard, and the CD stereo’s speakers sit up in the roof bars — a location good for blaring tunes at the beach. Jeep’s optional Freedom Top, which our test car had, includes three hard panels that can open up various sections of the roof.\n\nRemaining Issues\nReliability for the current generation has been miserable, and while antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard, the Wrangler is one of a handful of 2010 models that still don’t have standard side airbags. (Click here for a full list of standard safety features.) Seat-mounted side airbags are optional, but the vast majority of 2010 Wranglers I found for sale nationally did not have them. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t crash-tested the Wrangler with side airbags; without them, the two-door Wrangler scored Poor for side-impacts. The Wrangler Unlimited did only slightly better, scoring Marginal. Both models have IIHS’ top score, Good, in front crash tests and Marginal in rear impacts. IIHS has not conducted its latest roof-strength tests on the Wrangler.\n\nPricing starts at $21,165 for a four-wheel-drive, two-door Wrangler Sport. Unlimited Sport models run $23,410 if you’re willing to have rear-wheel drive, or $24,585 with four-wheel drive. Standard features include the Freedom Top, removable doors, a fold-down windshield and a CD stereo. An automatic transmission runs $825; it’s standard on rear-wheel-drive Unlimited models. Side airbags are $490. Depending on trim, you can get half-doors with plastic windows, air conditioning, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, cruise control and a navigation system. Check a few boxes, and it’s not hard to move the $28,775 two-door Rubicon past 30 large; check ’em all, and it can creep near $40,000.\n\nWrangler in the Market\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s best-selling vehicle this year, but sales are plummeting. I suspect that’s because more than two years of recession have produced a more practical car buyer who doesn’t need something with capabilities he’ll never use. That shift — long responsible for the demise of truck-based SUVs — may have finally affected Jeep’s original hit.\n\nReality bites, and the Wrangler’s once-broad weekend appeal — taking the top down, cranking some tunes and forgetting about tomorrow — faces some serious Monday-morning limitations. Off-road enthusiasts love their Wranglers, and for the diehards, this Jeep is a worthy product. I just wonder if anyone else should really consider it.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "I have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nA new drivetrain and recent upgrades make the 2012 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hard top is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions, the fender flares and removable hard top are body-colored.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Wrangler now comes with a new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, replacing a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6. Like the engine, the five-speed automatic comes from the Grand Cherokee, replacing the 2011’s four-speed. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions. See the two model years compared.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: More power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nJeep Wrangler Mileage\n(EPA-estimated city/highway – combined)\n \tManual\tAutomatic\n2011 Wrangler and\nWrangler Unlimited\t15/19 – 16\t15/19 – 17\n2012 Wrangler\t17/21 – 18\t17/21 – 18\n2012 Wrangler Unlimited\t16/21 – 18\t16/20 – 18\n\nThe rough old 3.8-liter V-6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher, at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe regular Wrangler now hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me … .\n\nThe Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus offroad capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (see the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Wrangler illustrates the tradeoffs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the Unlimited Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader tradeoff, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 24 competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages … .\n\nI’ll buy a Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s long-serving 4×4. It’s available as a two- or four-door SUV, the latter known as the Wrangler Unlimited. The two-door model has room for four people, while the Unlimited version seats five.\n\nA standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine works with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. Other available engines include a 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 260-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 and a 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. The Wrangler Unlimited 4xe has a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that lets the SUV travel up to 21 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for serious off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Ford Bronco, Toyota 4Runner and Land Rover Defender. The Wrangler Unlimited offers 18.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nA 4.88:1 axle ratio is optional for Rubicon models with the gas V-6, and Jeep says the cabin air filter can remove 95% of particulates. The Sahara 4xe adds blue tow hooks.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFolding soft top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower locks, windows and mirrors\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nRemote start\nAir conditioning\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAlpine premium stereo\n7- or 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2022 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model lacks creature comforts like power windows, air conditioning and power locks, but it still starts around $31,000. The more practical Wrangler Unlimited is even pricier. For your money, you get a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road. Better still, the latest Wrangler is better-behaved than its predecessor on paved surfaces.",

      "expert_review": "The last time we tested a Jeep Wrangler — and gave it a not-so-flattering review — the wrath of the Wrangler community came down on our heads. Many suggested they would like to take us off-roading to some distant spot — and leave us there.\n\nHere we are again, testing what has to be the most extreme Wrangler ever created, the 2003 Rubicon model. Rubicon is a reference to the treacherous California trail that is widely considered to be America’s most famous off-road playground. Like the Wrangler name, Rubicon is an icon to longtime Jeep enthusiasts.\n\nJeep boasts that this Toledo-built, limited-production Wrangler is an industry first for an automaker, since the vehicle has an off-road capability usually reserved for highly modified vehicles.\n\nThe Rubicon’s extra content is reflected in the price — a whopping $27,760 when you add amenities like a hard top, metal doors with roll-up windows and air conditioning.\n\nShe: I don’t think anyone would argue that the Wrangler Rubicon is ready for the trail, right out of the box. But I think our critique has to center on the claim made in the Rubicon’s press material that says, “As the four-wheel drive leader, the Jeep Wrangler is not only fully capable off-road, but is as fun to drive on-road.” I suppose the idea of fun starts right in your driveway, especially if you’re determined to do an impression of John Cleese from Monty Python doing the “Silly Walk” skit. I know it sounds superficial, given all the Rubicon’s impressive hardware, but it’s probably easier to ford a river in the Wrangler than haul yourself up into the front seat.\n\nHe: Well, lemme run right over to the river and try that, honey. Oops, I’m guessing you didn’t mean the Detroit River, which is difficult to Ford, er, ford. And you’re right about the Wrangler being less than user-friendly for everyday driving. As we’ve observed before, that appears to be part of the appeal. Only it seems that with the new Rubicon model, you’re paying even more for the privilege of driving one of the most primitive vehicles on the road today. Doesn’t matter. If you’re out in the woods or up in the mountains, and really want to reach that otherwise inaccessible cabin or stream, nobody does it much better than Jeep. Just don’t make me drive that Wrangler on the highway.\n\nShe: As far as looks and appeal to its audience, the Rubicon is a winner. I can always tell by the reaction of the local cops. One of the younger guys came by on a snowy morning and parked in our driveway for half an hour, mooning over the Wrangler. He was really taken with those massive 31-inch tires. They have a distinctive tread pattern that wraps around the sidewall to help grab ledges along the trail, according to Jeep. They are the largest tires offered from the factory on Wrangler, and off-roaders will be happy to discover they add an extra half-inch of ground clearance over the 30-inch tires. The Rubicon body graphics are fairly understated, but that Inca Gold exterior color will stand out like a beacon in the forest.\n\nHe: If you’re a serious off-roader, the Rubicon comes with lots of the right stuff — locking front and rear differentials, Dana 44 heavy-duty axles and a 4:1 low-range transfer case for gearing down to negotiate those really serious boulders and tree trunks. Skid plates protect the fuel tank and the transfer case, and front and rear tow hooks will help get you — or the other guys — out of trouble. That big 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine is pretty gutsy, too, delivering 190 horsepower and 235 pounds-feet of torque through a five-speed manual gearbox.\n\nShe: I think there is more to the Wrangler’s appeal than just the hardware. It makes me think of the TV show “Survivor” and all of its spin-offs about overcoming the wilderness. Like “Survivor,” the Rubicon must touch some deep spiritual need in people that is unmet in contemporary society. How can you put a price tag on satisfying that sort of need?\n\nHe: You say “spiritual need,” I say “primordial urge,” especially when you consider how many teenagers still look at the Wrangler as a hot property. I think that’s what disturbs me most. This is still the last vehicle I want my kid driving — unless, of course, he or she is somewhere out in the woods traveling at something less than 20 miles an hour. This is not a good combination for younger, inexperienced drivers on the freeway or even bopping around town — not when our $27,760 test vehicle lacked side air bags, anti-lock brakes and other basic safety amenities to offset its short wheelbase, high center of gravity and relative lack of sheet metal to mitigate side impacts.\n\nOff-highway, the Rubicon is a winner. On the road, it simply doesn’t measure up.\n\n2003 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, four-passenger sport-utility vehicle\n\nPrice (Includes $610 destination charge): Base, $24,385; as tested, $27,760\n\nEngine: 4.0-liter I-6; 190-hp; 235 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 mpg city/19 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Chevrolet Tracker, Kia Sportage, Nissan XTerra, Suzuki Vitara, Ford Explorer Sport\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan. Rates may vary depending on coverage and driving record): $1,395\n\nWhere built: Toledo, Ohio\n\nPaul’s Vehicle rating: Subpar\n\nLikes: Exceptional off-road capability for extreme conditions. $920 hard top cuts down on road noise. 5-speed heavy-duty transmission. Lots of character.\n\nDislikes: 4.0L I-6 sounds and feels coarse. Bouncy, uncomfortable ride. Not terribly civilized for everyday driving. Virtually no storage space. Little room for rear passengers. Some tire steer. Handles like a Jeep, requires delicate cornering. Visibility concerns with thick center pillar.\n\nAnita’s Vehicle rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes:Classic, rugged styling. Beefy 31-inch off-road tires, Rubicon graphics and diamond-plate sillprotectors. Simple, easy-to-use controls. New standard four-wheel disc brakes for improved stopping distance. Better seats with taller seat backs. 3-year/36,000-mile basic warranty.\n\nDislikes: Jeep quality at BMW prices. No power adjustment for side mirrors. Ridiculously tall step-in height. Minimal safety features — no side air bags, no anti-lock brakes. Short on features — full metal doors with roll-up windows, air conditioning are optional.",

      "expert_review": "Wrangler is still an adventure\nThe longer-wheelbase Jeep Unlimited is all business with classic top-down, beach-riding fun\n\nIn an age where most cars and trucks have been homogenized into one generic mass, there are still some vehicles that are iconoclasts. The Jeep Wrangler is one such vehicle.\n\nWhat the Wrangler shares with its off-road competition is four-wheel-drive and a rugged structure. But that’s where the similarity ends.\n\nThe Jeep is tested on the Rubicon Trail to ensure its off-road agility. Its upright windshield and familiar boxy shape pay little heed to aerodynamics. Its interior is notable in the absence of over-the-top comfort and convenience features. You want power windows and a DVD player? Buy a Grand Cherokee.\n\nThe Wrangler is the off-shoot of war-tested toughness and is the purest of SUVs. So it’s probably disconcerting to the Jeep faithful that a long-wheelbase version of the Wrangler, The Wrangler Unlimited is now on sale. This is especially true since Jeep public relations types use words like ‘quieter’ to describe its advantages.\n\nBut the Wrangler Unlimited successfully expands Jeep Wrangler choices without diluting its essense. The Unlimited gets a 10-inch longer wheelbase than the standard vehicle. At 103 inches, it’s almost as long as the Jeep Liberty SUV. All that extra room is put to good use: 2 inches added rear leg room and 13 inches added to the cargo area. Overall length is just shy of the Liberty as well, at 167 inches.\n\nThe Unlimited is priced at the higher end of the Wrangler line-up, which consists of SE, X, Sport, Rubicon and Sahara models. The Unlimited slots between the Rubicon and Sahara.\n\nOf course, the added length holds other benefits. As you would expect, the longer wheelbase lends the Wrangler Unlimited a better ride than its shorter brethren. Back and forth pitching, as well as body lean are somewhat reduced over the Wrangler. Of course, there’s more space as well. Adults will actually fit comfortably in the back seat. It’s a bit quieter. It even boasts a higher tow rating, 3,500 pounds, versus 1,500 for the standard Wrangler.\n\nThankfully, refinement is at a minimum here.\n\nThe only drivetrain is the tried and true 4-liter in-line six-cylinder motor, producing 190 horsepower and 235 foot-pounds of torque mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Low-speed grunt is good, but it gets winded when revved at highway speed.\n\nThe engine note is positively agricultural. While loud, it won’t drown out your Montavani CDs.\n\nIf you want leather seats, look elsewhere, this Jeep is all business. You can tell as you climb into the vehicle. Open the door and you’ll see exposed exterior door hinges, along with a strap to hold the door from swinging open too far.\n\nManual door locks, roll-up windows, cloth seats and lots of exposed sheet metal transmits this vehicle’s bare-bones message.\n\nBut seat comfort is better than you’d expect. The radio isn’t what you’d expect. It’s reception is weak and the sound quality mediocre, but most owners won’t care.\n\nIf you’re used to some peace and quiet, you’ve come to the wrong place. The soft-top test model features plastic side windows, which can rattle along with the top.\n\nThis year’s Jeep Wrangler features the Sunrider option. The Sunrider allows a 45 by 23-inch opening in the soft top, without folding down the whole roof.\n\nAnd believe me, with more than 20-some steps, folding the roof takes time. Again, this is part of the Wrangler’s ‘charm,’ but that soft-top made accessing the cargo compartment impossible. With the soft top in place, the fabric prevented the swing-out rear cargo door from opening.\n\nInside, Wrangler Unlimited models get full-steel doors, tinted windows, Sunrider soft-top, air conditioning, AM/FM/CD stereo, sliding front seats, folding rear seat, air bags and power steer ng.\n\nOptions are as basic as the vehicle, including running boards, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, engine block heater, hard top, a locking fuel cap, leather-wrapped steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nYou can get a theft-deterrent system for $75, but that seems useless in a vehicle you can enter by unfastening Velcro straps on the soft-top.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler Unlimited test vehicle bottom-lined at $25,520. That’s the same price range as the Liberty, with a similar-sized package.\n\nBut the Liberty can’t offer the classic image or top-down beach buggy fun of the Unlimited.\n\nWhile other vehicles outclass the Jeep in refinement or options, there is only one tried and true Jeep and all its warts are still showing.\n\nSo what.",

      "expert_review": "Due to mechanical difficulties, my husband and I had to make a last-minute change in plans in order to drive a fresh little convertible on the day of our wedding. With hours to go, my then-fiance was remarkably lucky to get his hot little hands on a Jeep Wrangler. It arrived with mud streaks on either side from the previous renter’s adrenaline-driven four-wheel-drive mission deep into the hills.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the threat of an imminent thunderstorm made for brisk hellos and thank yous. As the rain started, my newly-wed husband and I dashed to the Jeep. Breathless and panting I carelessly jumped into the rugged off-road machine, where we broke out in laughter. I remember how endless ripples of white silk blanketed my husband and filled the entire interior of the car. It was a comical sight, indeed!\n\nFast forward a decade, and I have had a second rendezvous with the Jeep Wrangler. I’ve traded the wedding gown for two kids and visiting relatives, and if I thought this two-door off-roader seemed small with my voluminous wedding dress inside, then I was in for a real treat now. As I wrestled my 3-year old’s car seat into the backseat, I almost threw out my back. By week’s end, I could barely walk. The car seat installation process was cumbersome on its own, but getting my son into his car seat was a daily nightmare, so much so, that I avoided any errands I didn’t have to do. I dreaded the uncomfortable multi-step process of having to manually slide forward the driver’s seat as far as possible, dropping the seatback, stepping up while balancing a child in my arms, squeezing one of my legs through to the back without getting caught in the seatbelt, desperately avoiding bonking anyone’s head and twisting my torso in a painful way to buckle him in. Whew!\n\nOnce I got the kids into their seats, I focused on my own comfort, or shall I say, lack of comfort. I couldn’t seem to lower the seat cushion far enough to easily reach the gas pedal. Either I was too close to the dash or too far from the pedal, creating a tired suspended-foot like sensation. Additionally, the turn signal lever was more of a reach than I am used to. The soft-top Jeep also drowned out conversation, forcing us to keep repeating ourselves. At one point, my first grader requested me to “please put up the windows.” To his surprise they were up; the car was just plain noisy. You can add bumpy to the list as well. On the highway, I caught my kids playing the AAAAHHHHH game in an attempt to point out the skipping of their voices as we bumped over each and every highway seam (at a thirsty 19 mpg to boot).\n\nFor a rugged adventure bound vehicle, one might expect a decent set of cup holders. I was baffled when I could barely fit my slim Camelbak water bottle, meaning that my 1-liter Nalgene would not stand a chance. Furthermore, the driver and passenger door compartments are so tiny that I couldn’t even house my carpool name cards. They seem best reserved for pens/tire gauges and other small trinkets.\n\nHaving been outdoors with our kids hiking and climbing trees, we brought pine needles back with us. I noticed that a few needles got stuck in the net-like upholstery. After a brief, and unsuccessful, attempt at removing them, I gave up, shaking my head at what other things would get stuck as well. That’s a bad design, if you care about that kind of thing!\n\nAfter picking up my engineering-minded dad at the airport, he managed to painfully pinch his finger in the window in what I assume was an information gathering effort to test the optional power windows for kid’s safety.. Thanks Dad, for sacrificing your fingers and being the guinea pig, here! Of course, kids delve into everything on their own, and pinch protection should be there to safeguard them from accidents such as these.\n\nAs I reviewed my notes on the Jeep the night before its return, I learned that I could not easily switch on and off the dome light. After consulting the owner’s manual I discovered that I had to turn one of the driver’s control levers to illuminate the interior. So much for the push of a button!\n\nWe’ve all seen the bumper stickers: It’s a Jeep thing. You wouldn’t understand. Well, I admit, I don’t understand. I don’t understand why anyone would choose to put themselves through the misery of transporting children in this car if they did not absolutely have to.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Jeep Wrangler. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI have a problem with the saying “It’s a Jeep thing; you wouldn’t understand.” Often asserted by hardcore Jeep fans, it’s part celebration, part explanation and part admonition. Sure, it’s a little bitchy and defensive, but that’s not why I object. The problem is that it’s outdated. No longer is there much to misunderstand about most Jeep models, from the Compass to the Grand Cherokee, whose sophistication compares more favorably to competitors. The saying should be, “It’s a Wrangler thing; you wouldn’t understand.” This I agree with. The legendary Wrangler off-roader is a singular entity. I understand it, as do many other rabid fans, but you might not.\n\nRecent upgrades make the 2013 Jeep Wrangler more appealing for the true believers — and maybe even some agnostics — but they won’t be enough to sway nonbelievers.\n\nThe Wrangler is available in two body styles: the two-door and the Unlimited four-door (see the specs). Both are convertibles, though it’s not always obvious to the casual observer because an optional removable hardtop is available in lieu of the traditional soft-top. The three shared trim levels are the Sport, Sahara and Rubicon. The Unlimited adds a Sport RHD above the Sport. In the higher two versions, the fender flares and removable hardtop are body-colored.\n\nChanges for 2013 include redesigned seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, new wheel designs for Rubicon and Sahara trim levels, an optional Alpine premium stereo and a new optional premium soft-top that has nicer material than the regular top and three layers for better noise isolation. See the 2012 and 2013 models compared here.\n\nThe Drivetrain Hat Trick\nThe Wrangler comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 engine and five-speed automatic transmission that replaced a less powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and four-speed in the 2012 model year. Jeep kindly continues to offer six-speed manual transmissions.\n\nWhat does all this give you? The drivetrain hat trick: more power, higher efficiency and improved noise and vibration performance.\n\nThe rough, old 3.8-liter V-6 produced 202 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 237 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. The new 3.6 puts out 285 hp at 6,400 rpm and 260 pounds-feet at 4,800 rpm. The torque peak is now higher up the rev range, but there’s also more range to work with: The new engine’s redline is almost 1,000 rpm higher at 6,600 rpm. There’s plenty of grunt at lower rpm to get the Jeep moving swiftly off the line and to scramble over obstacles that would put some SUVs in an early grave. All Wranglers come with standard part-time four-wheel drive, which means you can use rear-wheel drive in normal conditions, then activate four-wheel drive when it’s needed.\n\nThe current Wrangler hits 60 mph in about 8.4 seconds, down from roughly 11 seconds in the 2011 model. The transmission is also well-behaved, with only occasional hesitation, which is sometimes a problem among newer automatics with higher gear counts.\n\nOdds Are You Won’t Understand\nNow we get to the stuff most people won’t understand — aspects of the Wrangler most motorists would fairly view as inferiorities. Just stick with me.\n\nThe Wrangler doesn’t ride smoothly. It has improved dramatically over the years and is more livable than ever, especially in the relatively new Unlimited version, thanks to its longer wheelbase. But there’s no overcoming its design and heavy-duty hardware. The Wrangler has non-independent front and rear axles that optimize suspension travel and thus off-road capability. Optional locking front and rear differentials and giant, aggressively treaded off-road tires (as on the Rubicon trim level) make the Wrangler even more formidable in the wild — and less genteel on pavement.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the Wrangler illustrates the trade-offs that accompany high ground clearance. You get your first taste when climbing in — and it definitely is climbing. Old-school SUV ride height combines with a shortage of grab handles to test your ground clearance. Tubular step rails, which are optional on lower trim levels and standard on the higher ones, aren’t much help: They’re nearly as high off the street as the cabin’s floor, with the apparent priority of clearing obstacles, not assisting passengers. They’re actually an obstacle for tall people because they widen the sills. In my time with the Unlimited Sahara, the steps proved most adept at collecting and transferring dirt and road salt to my pant leg.\n\nYou’d be better off with a step that splits the distance between the street and the interior — something you might find in the aftermarket.\n\nDon’t Look Back\nOnce inside, you’ll find a high dashboard, which shorter drivers might not like. Thankfully, there’s a standard seat-height adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, though it doesn’t telescope. Visibility is mixed: High ride height provides the usual eagle’s perch, but the rear view has one obstruction after another. The spare tire eats up much of the rear window, the rear wiper mechanism encroaches and the two backseat head restraints (which don’t fold down) also conspire to block your view.\n\nUpgrades from the past couple of years have classed up the cabin, and the noise level in there is better than ever, though by no means class-leading. You’ll hear low-rev engine rumble, and the other sounds vary greatly depending on tire and roof choice.\n\nThe Unlimited’s longer wheelbase and extra doors make for a larger backseat than the regular Wrangler provides, but this model still reflects the norm for fully capable off-roaders: Large on the outside doesn’t always equal roomy on the inside.\n\nThe backseat is snug and it doesn’t slide forward and back as some do, and the backrests don’t recline. They do fold forward, however, in a remarkably simple single step. The head restraints are hinged to fold back and spring-loaded to return upright along with the backrest. (It would be nice if you could keep them down to improve the rear view.)\n\nThe cargo area is a similar story. The Wrangler has 12.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 55 cubic feet when it’s folded. That’s well below four-doors like the Nissan Xterra’s 36.3/65.7 cubic feet and the Toyota FJ Cruiser’s 27.9/66.8 cubic feet. The Wrangler Unlimited compares more favorably at 31.5/70.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe Wrangler benefits from its square shape. The longer Grand Cherokee’s maximum cargo volume is 68.3. But respectable numbers don’t always reflect usable space. The Wrangler’s cargo floor is quite narrow due to large wheel wells and a small opening when the swing gate is open.\n\nRather than a conventional liftgate, the Wrangler has a swing gate to accommodate the spare tire, which swings out with it. Another off-roader trade-off, the spare is back here so it doesn’t gobble more cargo area or ride under the chassis, where it would diminish the truck’s departure angle.\n\nAgain, because of the spare tire, the liftglass doesn’t raise independently until the gate is out of the way. And I’m surprised the gate swings toward the curb in this American vehicle; it forces you to load from the street side.\n\nSafety\nThe Wrangler’s crash-test ratings are below average. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the two-door scored the highest rating, Good, in a frontal crash, but Poor (the lowest rating) in a side impact and Marginal for protection in a rear impact. This makes the Wrangler the worst performer out of 15 models in IIHS’ Small SUV class.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited is slightly better, with a Marginal side-impact rating, but it, too, places last in the IIHS’ Midsize SUV class when all three tests are considered — among 21 competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but it earned three stars out of five in the organization’s rollover rating, which indicates a higher-than-average center of gravity and greater rollover potential than most SUVs, which achieve four stars. Direct competitors, the Xterra and FJ Cruiser, are also in the three-star club.\n\nThe Wrangler has standard frontal airbags and offers front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags as a stand-alone option. There are no side curtain airbags. As is required on all new cars as of the 2012 model year, the Wrangler has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. A backup camera and blind spot warning system aren’t offered. See the full safety feature list here.\n\nOverall, we found the Wrangler Unlimited accommodates three different types of child-safety seats well. See the Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat Wrangler Fans Understand\nFrankly, there’s a lot about the Wrangler for shoppers not to understand. Yet both body styles sell like mad, and their fans are simply mad about them. I happen to be one of them.\n\nThere are drivers who like to laugh at speed bumps, to get unmatched open-air driving and unassailable winter-weather performance in the same vehicle. These are people for whom activating (and deactivating) four-wheel drive by hand is not a drawback, but rather part of the experience. Anyone who doesn’t understand this — or manual transmissions, for that matter — can go to the auto mall, throw a Frappuccino in any direction and hit an alternative that does everything for you, and in some circumstances does it better. For the rest of us, there’s the Wrangler.\n\nDuring most of the SUV revolution, models were based on trucks out of necessity. Now, most SUVs and “crossovers” are lighter — and lighter duty — and satisfy most buyers as well as the trucks did — or better. But there are still buyers who want the ruggedness and/or off-road ability. It’s fitting that these buyers are finding refuge in the Jeep brand. The Wrangler is a survivor. Its predecessor came to prominence in The Good War, and it has outlived its military successor, the Hummer, as a consumer product.\n\nTrue, most Wranglers never tread on anything more challenging than a dirt road, but people buy them anyway. Likewise, most SUVs never tow trailers, many sports cars spend all their time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I’ve met countless Americans who own a pickup truck so they can make one or two trips a year to the home store. People who park in glass garages …\n\nI’ll buy a Wrangler someday — probably the previous-generation, known as the TJ. The current generation, the JK, is too big for my needs, and a little too slick. Wranglers aren’t for everybody. If ever they are, I just won’t understand.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif. – Lumbar? Yeah, right.\n\nDVD players? Are you kidding?\n\nAnd supple leather? Better go back to your cappuccino after your game of racquetball, dude.\n\nAt its core, the Jeep Wrangler is the ultimate toy.\n\nHardly refined, barely comfortable, the Wrangler is like that mousetrap ride you used to enjoy on summer trips to the amusement park.\n\n“You’ve got to be crazy not to love this,” John Hales of Monterey, Calif., told me on a recent trip to the ultimate Jeep resort, something Chrysler calls Camp Jeep. “This is freedom.”\n\nNot to mention fun.\n\nThey’ve been running Camp Jeep for 10 years now – mostly in Virginia and Colorado. This year was Chrysler’s first run in California.\n\nThe premise is simple: You can roll up in your own Jeep and spend a few days climbing mountains, traversing a ravine and pounding the blood out of your vehicle.\n\nThe bottom line: It provides the true off-roader experience that brings out the best in the 2005 Jeep Wrangler Sport Unlimited, our test vehicle in California and back in the Midwest.\n\nThe real secret: After getting back on city streets, where the only off-roading usually involves a mall parking lot, the new Wrangler was just as capable.\n\nFor the un-Jeeped among us, the regular-length Wrangler comes as a two-door in four trim levels – SE, X, Sport and Rubicon. The Unlimited is an extended-wheelbase that also arrives with two doors, but only in Standard, Sport and Rubicon trim. With 15 extra inches in length, the beauty of the Unlimited is that it doubles the cargo capacity of the traditional model and increases rear-seat knee room for two more passengers who are forced to sit on the bench.\n\nThe dials and gauges look like a return to 1980. The seating position (close to the glass) is like a go-kart.\n\nTake the highway in the soft-top Wrangler and you might need earplugs to negate the flapping cloth and plastic top. This is still pretty primitive – just a hair above motorcycle levels. But at least the interior can be cleaned with a hose.\n\nA hard-top version is available and recommended. I’ve known too many people who have had their plastic Wrangler windows cut and had everything stolen with soft-top models. Also, an extraordinary amount of patience is required for the removal or installation of the soft version. But as an added plus, the soft-top can be folded back to provide the ultimate sunroof.\n\nSE models are powered by a 2.4-liter in-line four-cylinder that is mated to a six-speed manual transmission (new this year) and kicks out 147 horsepower.\n\nA four-speed automatic is optional. All other trim levels get a hearty 4-liter in-line six-cylinder that makes 190 horsepower. Maximum towing capacity is 3,500 on Unlimited models.\n\nThe 4-liter offers all kinds of torque and excellent acceleration. It puts the fun in the Wrangler’s fun quotient.\n\nThe turning radius is tight – perfect for shopping mall “off-roading” – and the handling is reasonable.\n\nAs for drawbacks, there are a few.\n\nWind and road noise might bother some folks who have never owned a Jeep. The step-in height is more than your average SUV. And the suspension might be too jarring for some.\n\nFor those who don’t buy in, there are 10,000 Camp Jeep campers (and many others) who will take your spot.\n\nAt the heart of it, this isn’t about being refined. This is about off-roading, tough, go-anywhere driving.\n\nIt’s about an affordable ($23,745 in base Unlimited models), classic, fun-to-drive ride.\n\nNo leather. No lattes.\n\nAnd proud of it.\n\n2005 Jeep Wrangler Sport Unlimited\n\nVehicle type: All-wheel-drive, front-engine, two-door, four-passenger sport utility vehicle\n\nKey competition: Land Rover Freelander\n\nBase engine: 147 horsepower 2.4-liter in-line four-cylinder\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual or four-speed automatic\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel disc brakes; dual front air bags\n\nMPG rating: 15 city/19 highway\n\nManufactured: United States\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles\n\nBase price: $23,745\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $26,025",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Hard Rock is noisy, inefficient, floaty and bouncy — but like an ugly puppy, you can’t help but love it.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is one of the most iconic vehicles on the road today. Even though this latest model shares no parts with the original Willys Jeep that helped the Allies win World War II, the shapes, the mission and the image of the Wrangler remain the same: Go anywhere, anytime.\n\nThere are few vehicles in the world that can do what a Wrangler can do – take you to nearly any corner of the wilderness and navigate rush-hour traffic without undue stress. Even fewer can do it for the Wrangler’s sticker price. But as good as Wranglers are in the mud and on trails, do they work as daily drivers? Hundreds of thousands of people own and love them, but is buying one setting yourself up for disappointment?\n\nFor 2015, Jeep tweaked just a couple of things in the Wrangler, adding an optional nine-speaker Alpine sound system and changing out a few paint colors (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here). I spent a summer week with a new 2015 Wrangler Rubicon Hard Rock two-door — Jeep’s top off-road-ready rock-crawler — to see what life with the dedicated 4×4 is like.\nExterior & Styling\nPark a Wrangler next to an original Jeep, and the resemblance is clear. The design has gotten significantly larger and safer over the years, but like the Porsche 911 and Volkswagen Beetle, there’s no mistaking the current Wrangler if you’ve seen its forebear.\n\nMy test model was a two-door Rubicon Hard Rock, the top-spec off-road model. As such, it had some cosmetic differences from lesser Wranglers: a winch-ready steel front bumper with red tow hooks; black rocker panel guards; a “power dome” hood with functional heat-extractor louvers; and unique wheels with chunky off-road tires. It looks like a Tonka toy, with oversized features and scoops and flaps. In other words, it looks fantastic — exactly how every Jeep should look.\n\nThe proof of the Rubicon Hard Rock’s style came during my brief visit to a dealer. While trundling through the parking lot, top down and doors off, a family with a young boy stopped and stared. The boy sported an ear-to-ear grin, pointed and declared: “THAT’S the one you should get, Dad!”\nHow It Drives\nUnlike some small SUVs — which look the part of off-roaders but are actually modified, tall-riding compact cars underneath — the Wrangler behaves exactly as it looks. It’s a true go-anywhere 4×4 machine.\n\nWhat does this mean on the street? It’s loud, with tire noise from the chunky mud-ready tires, wind noise (because it’s about as slippery through the air as a box of Kleenex) and road noise through the cabin combining to create a highway cacophony that’s impressive, in a sense. Put the top down or drive around with the doors off, however, and you won’t care in the slightest.\n\nThe handling characteristics are best described as “approximate,” meaning the truck steers approximately where you want it to. The soft off-road suspension and beefy Dana 44 solid axles, front and rear, give an acceptable ride quality. The body, however, dips and squats when accelerating and stopping, then dips again with each gear change of the long-throw, six-speed manual transmission.\n\nHighway directional stability is awful, with the Wrangler wandering all over the lane and requiring constant adjustment. The off-road tires don’t help, either, meant as they are for traction in dirty, muddy conditions instead of tarmac.\n\nThe steering behavior is also unusual. There’s very little return-to-center motion, meaning that after completing a turn you’ll need to center the wheel instead of just letting the truck straighten itself out. The four-door model, called the Unlimited, smooths out a lot of these rough edges; its longer wheelbase adds considerable stability to the formula.\n\nAll the qualities that make the Wrangler awful to drive on the street make it amazing in the rough. The SUV can scale hills you’d have trouble walking over, blast through deep water and thick mud — you name it. But know that if you’re considering one as a daily driver, it comes with compromises.\n\nOne area that has improved dramatically over previous Wranglers is the engine. Since 2012, the Wrangler has come only with a fully modern 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine. That’s the same one found in nearly all V-6-powered Fiat Chrysler Automobiles products these days. It puts out a healthy 285 horsepower but doesn’t feel like it, as the Wrangler is geared for better off-road traction, not on-road snap. So while it has plenty of guts and not a lot of weight, it’s not what anyone would call quick (unless you’ve driven the previous six- or four-cylinder Wrangler; then it will seem speedy).\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard, while a five-speed automatic is an option. The four-wheel-drive system is part-time only, with a transfer case shift lever that you use only when you’re in situations that call for it: namely, slippery conditions that let the front wheels spin a bit. Use it on dry pavement, and you risk damage to the axles. The Wrangler’s isn’t an on-demand all-wheel-drive or full-time four-wheel-drive system like most modern SUVs have.\n\nThe big benefit of the new engine comes in fuel economy. The new Wrangler is rated 17/21/18 mpg city/highway/combined (manual and automatic), a significant improvement over previous generations. My week of testing included a good mix of city and highway miles, but I had the top down and doors off more often than not, adding considerable aerodynamic drag to an already bad situation (a Kleenex box with holes in it?).  As such, my week with the Wrangler netted about 16.5 mpg on average. This likely would have been improved with the automatic transmission, as the temptation to keep the Wrangler in a lower gear for better acceleration is eliminated.\nInterior\nPop open one of the Wrangler’s free-swinging doors (they’re restricted only by a fabric strap door check without détentes like a normal car door) and climb up and in. You’ll be greeted by a very upright, very old-school driving position.\n\nThe steering wheel is close to both you and the dash, but there’s some thoughtful and logical arrangement of everything in the truck. The audio and climate controls are located high in the dash, making for easy operation while driving but also keeping sensitive electronics out of the danger zone in case you decide to ford some deep water.\n\nThere’s all-weather carpeting in the Wrangler, with drain plugs in the floor in case you need to hose out your rig – something you can actually do, if you’re careful about where you spray.\n\nBecause you’re sitting up so high and the Wrangler has nearly vertical body surfaces, outward visibility is quite good. It’s even better when you take the doors and top off, producing arguably the most open-air vehicle you can buy short of a motorcycle.\n\nFront seat comfort isn’t bad at all, with decent-sized, supportive chairs. Backseat room is acceptable, as well, but does require a bit of twisting to climb into the space. Legroom is at a premium in back. That’s ameliorated by the longer Unlimited, but at a price premium.\n\nThe Wrangler is truly at its best when you can make the outside your inside, however. Lowering the top and removing the doors takes a little practice, but it’s not as convoluted or difficult as it has been in previous-generation models. The Sunrider top even lets you fold back just the portion over the front seats for a big sunroof effect. Dropping it entirely requires you to unzip and remove the rear window, as well as both left and right side panels. You then either store them in the backseat or leave them at home.\n\nObviously, the ability to gain access to the inside of your Wrangler by simply unzipping a window means you shouldn’t leave anything valuable in the truck, ever, unless you opt for the marginally more secure three-piece hardtop. Accidentally leaving the center console unlocked while the doors were off resulted in someone stealing the tool kit that contained the door bolts I’d stored inside it.\n\nRemoving the doors is also simple: Just unclip the electrical wiring harness (if you have power windows), use the included tool kit to undo two Torx hinge bolts per side, lift it off and store it somewhere safe. The feeling of driving around without doors, while likely horribly unsafe in the event of a side-impact crash, is a thrill unrivaled in the motorized world, save anything with only two wheels. A few blocks in a completely open Wrangler can immediately make you forget all the truck’s ills and foibles. You’ll find yourself grinning like an idiot and saying to yourself, “Y’know, this really ain’t bad at all!”\nErgonomics & Electronics\nNot much has changed in the Wrangler in recent years with regard to electronics. The gauges still incorporate old-style, dot-matrix LCD displays, and the stereo head unit is still last-generation Chrysler corporate, as are the climate-control knobs. It all works just fine, but doesn’t look as updated as it could.\n\nJeep has updated the audio system, however, with a standard eight-speaker stereo or an optional nine-speaker Alpine premium sound system. The Alpine system relocates the subwoofer from the side of the rear cargo area (where it was in the 2014 model) to the floor. How wise it is to put a speaker grille at the bottom of a cargo area is uncertain, especially in a vehicle likely to get sandy and dirty in normal use, but the quality of the Alpine system is undeniable. It’s the first sound system I’ve ever heard in a Wrangler that sounds good, top up or down.\nCargo & Storage\nGiven that the Wrangler is not physically all that big inside, you have the choice of carrying people or stuff, but generally not both. Space behind the rear seat is a limited 12.8 cubic feet, but that rear seat can be folded forward or even removed, making for a much more usable 55.0 cubic feet of space. That said, doing so leaves you with just a two-seat SUV, so if you need to carry more people when you get where you’re going, that could be a problem. The four-door Unlimited is much more spacious, featuring 31.5 cubic feet of room behind the rear seat that’s expandable to 70.6 cubic feet in total. It’s more suitable for people who regularly need to haul people and stuff together.\n\nIf you think you can make up for the lack of cargo room with a trailer, well, you won’t be able to haul all that much, either. The two-door Wrangler is rated to tow only 2,000 pounds, while the four-door can tow 3,500 pounds. That’s a very, very small pop-up camper or a Jet Ski, but the Wrangler’s relatively short wheelbase prevents it from safely towing anything too heavy.\nSafety\nThe Wrangler has been crash-tested, and the news isn’t good. For some reason, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has rated the Wrangler only for rollover protection, where it earned three out of five stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has tested the Wrangler more extensively, and the results are mixed (see full results here). The Wrangler scores good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) only in the moderate overlap front test, which is admittedly a tough one. But it goes downhill from there, with the Jeep earning a marginal score in the small overlap front test and in the head restraints and seats test. It earned a poor rating in side-impact protection (the tested vehicle wasn’t equipped with the Wrangler’s optional side airbags).\n\nThere is no available electronic forward-crash detection system, blind spot warning, automatic braking, parking sensors or even a backup camera. The backup camera would be welcome to mitigate the Wrangler’s terrible rear visibility, due in part to the full-size spare tire mounted directly behind the rear window.\n\nSee what few safety features can be had on a Wrangler here.\nValue in Its Class\nSo the Wrangler is primitive, loud, bouncy, inefficient, not terribly crashworthy and offers hellacious amounts of fun. It’s also expensive. A base Wrangler Sport starts at $23,990 including destination fee, but you’ll never find one on a dealer lot anywhere close to that price. That Sport comes with a manual transmission but without air conditioning, which can be added separately or as part of the better equipped and much more common Sport S option package.\n\nNext in line is the fancier Sahara model for $29,990, including considerably more standard features, body-colored fenders instead of black plastic, an optional body-colored painted hardtop, 18-inch wheels and more. The top of the line is the Rubicon, which starts at $33,190 and includes a host of off-road upgrades, such as a dedicated off-road suspension, beefier axles front and rear, 32-inch mud-terrain tires, a stronger 4×4 transfer case, electronic sway bar disconnect and more.\n\nMy test model was a Rubicon with the Hard Rock Package, which includes a combination of cosmetic changes, like the power dome hood, and option bundles like air conditioning and USB connectivity. My as-tested price was $38,835.\n\nThat’s a lot of coin for a truck as primitive as the Wrangler, but it costs that much because Jeep can charge that much for it and get it. The reason? There are no direct competitors to the two-door Wrangler. The closest in abilities is the Land Rover Defender 90 (not sold in the U.S.), the super-expensive Mercedes-Benz G550 or possibly a Nissan Xterra Pro-4X. Most of those, however, are four-door SUVs and considerably more expensive, and few have the provenance and fanatical following the Wrangler commands.\n\nXterra drivers don’t wave at each other like Wrangler owners do. There isn’t a massive nationwide G-Class enthusiast group that organizes three-dozen off-road events around the country, like the Jeep Jamboree network. And on none of these can you take the top and doors off.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Normally, the announcement of an upcoming model would be a cause for celebration among a marque’s loyalists. This is not necessarily true with die-hard devotees of the Jeep Wrangler, arguably the most traditional mainstream vehicle you can buy, usually purchased by savvy customers who are skeptical of “innovations.”\n\nTwo Jeep generations ago, the company began using innovative rectangular headlights. In this past generation, introduced in 1997, Jeep returned to round headlights, weary of bumper stickers and T-shirts that said, “REAL Jeeps have round headlights!”\n\nSo news that Jeep will introduce a new Wrangler this fall has been met with suspicion. The 2007 Wrangler looks quite a bit like the current model, but it’s roomier inside — that’s fine — and it has a new 3.8-liter engine. This has been a cause for alarm, not because anyone suspects the new engine won’t be good, but because the current engine — a 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder — is one of the most durable, downright bulletproof engines ever built. That’s important if you are inclined to drive deep into the woods, miles from the nearest Mr. Goodwrench.\n\nConsequently, sales of the 2006 Jeep Wrangler have remained strong. Though the new engine has 15 more horsepower than the current 190-horse model, there are lots of stories out there of creaking old 4.0-liters with 250,000 miles on them.\n\nWe spent a week in a 2006 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited — the Unlimited is 15 inches longer than the regular Wrangler — and while I haven’t driven a 2007 model, there’s a lot to like about this ’06.\n\nBut then, not being much of a Jeep traditionalist, there are a couple of things I would like to change. One is the darty, ultraquick steering, which is fine off-road, annoying on the road. Another is the fact that the accelerator and brake pedals are so close together. Sometimes I would stab the brakes and find that I still had part of a shoe on the accelerator. My size 11’s are big, but not that big.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other aspects of the Wrangler that, to most people, would be simply unacceptable in a road vehicle, such as the flexy nylon straps that limit the doors’ travel; the wind and road noise, the roughish ride and the awkward tailgate on the test Jeep’s optional hardtop.\n\nBut this isn’t really a road vehicle — it’s an amazingly accomplished off-road vehicle that just happens to be legal for the road. Plenty of posers have bought Wranglers because of the rugged looks, and found them to be rugged, period — unsatisfactory around town and on the highway. But those owners never take their Wranglers off-road, where they can see how the vehicle’s minimalist city manners translate into impeccable trail manners. Too bad. These are vehicles best driven by those aware of their limitations — Wranglers, with their tipsy temperament and absence of safety features, make lousy first vehicles for teenagers.\n\nAll that said, this 2006 Wrangler Unlimited is nearly civilized, largely a function of the lengthened wheelbase that makes it more stable on the road, and only marginally less capable off the road. The base Wrangler is offered with a 2.4-liter, 147-horsepower four-cylinder, but the Unlimited comes only with that venerable 4.0-liter six-cylinder. Jeep has calmed this once rough-running engine dramatically, and coupled to an optional four-speed automatic transmission (a six-speed manual is standard), it’s a very pleasant powertrain.\n\nAnd in low-range gear, the engine’s 235 foot-pounds of torque — that’s the measure of pulling power — makes strenuous off-roading easy. After a drive several years ago on the treacherous Rubicon Trail, on the California-Nevada border, this 4.0-liter engine, automatic transmission and I became very good friends. Off-road with a manual transmission? Sorry, too much work.\n\nEven with the stretch job, rear seats in the Wrangler Unlimited are not all that comfortable, but they sure are roomier. The lengthening also means a healthy 11.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the seats, or 24.2 cubic feet if you “tumble” the rear seats forward, or 45.8 cubic feet if you remove the rear seat.\n\nIf you can live without the luxuries, the regular Wrangler starts at $18,204, but that’s a pretty bare-bones model. Our test Unlimited started at $24,165, and after adding options such as the automatic transmission, a “Premium package,” cruise control and a few other features, the list price was $28,910, including shipping. That’s not cheap, but Jeep Wranglers, if you take care of them, return a large part of your investment in resale value.\n\nJeep has had plenty of time to fine-tune the Wrangler, and it shows. Apparently the company has learned something too: The 2007 Jeep Wrangler will have round headlights.",

      "expert_review": "Just as Jeep has expanded its lineup, it’s also expanded its classic Wrangler. It gains two more doors, better road manners and more creature comforts, but remains a capable offroad vehicle.\n\nWhat’s good about the Jeep is its cargo area, offroad capability and Spartan interior, plus the fact that it’s unique. What’s bad about this Jeep is that it comes with a variety of interior features that might discourage some from really getting it dirty.\n\nExterior\nThe Unlimited is longer — almost 10 inches longer — than the regular Wrangler; two extra doors will do that to a car. It doesn’t look unnaturally long or oddly proportioned, though, which is interesting because it’s only about a quarter-inch wider than the two-door version. Usually when a car gets longer but not wider it looks goofy, but the Wrangler doesn’t. Thanks to the standard offroad tires on our Rubicon model, though, it rides quite high.\n\nTraditional Jeep styling remains. The grille has the same seven slots as the two-door model, and the fenders flare widely out from the sides. Our test vehicle came with a soft-top and the subsequent array of zippers required to remove it. That zip-off roof is probably the feature that most clearly says “Wrangler”; thanks to consistent rain, I never had a chance to drop the top, but it’s the same multi-step process Wrangler devotees are used to.\n\nInterior\nAs with past Wranglers, the Unlimited values function over form. It’s not designed to be a luxury car, so there’s a fair bit of exposed metal. The interior surfaces are all hard to the touch, to facilitate cleanup.\n\nThe seats are supportive and height-adjustable. As is the case in the two-door Wrangler, there is no dead pedal (an area to the left of the gas and brake pedals) to rest your foot on while driving. Other reviewers have complained about this, but I got used to it after a couple hours on the highway.\n\nOne of the things older Jeeps have is a rough-and-ready interior you can hose out when you’re done playing — heck, they even put drain plugs in the floor. To keep it contemporary, they also put a navigation system and hard drive in ours, so be careful where you point that hose. In fact, our test model came with a carpet, and finding the drain hole proved impossible for me. Maybe it was there, but if it was I would have needed to cut a hole in the carpet to be sure. It may be a Wrangler, but I wouldn’t suggest trying to hose this model out.\n\nThe extra length is more noticeable inside. Rear seat space is OK, but the cargo area is huge. I used it to donate some clothes and kitchen items to charity, then later put my bike, tent and sleeping bag in it, and it carried a surprising amount of cargo. The charity items included about nine 18-by-12-by-10-inch boxes, and the bike was a 58-cm road frame, so we’re not talking about a bunch of tiny things. Cargo capacity with all the seats in place is 46.4 cu. ft., larger than the Nissan Xterra’s 35.2 cu. ft. and the Ford Escape’s 29.2 cu. ft.\n\nThe soft-top can occasionally slap like a sail at highway speeds, but it didn’t happen as consistently in the Wrangler Unlimited as I’ve experienced in older Jeeps. If that bothers you, there’s a hardtop version of the Unlimited that solves that problem.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Jeep felt pretty pokey, both when driving around the city and especially when on the highway. That’s partly because of the combination of slow accelerator response and a four-speed automatic transmission. The thing is, the 3.8-liter V-6 makes 202 horsepower and 237 pounds-feet of torque, so there is muscle there, it’s just not very quick off the line or when passing at highway speeds. The transmission takes a second to kick down, and when it does there’s still more noise than acceleration.\n\nThe Wrangler Unlimited gets the same mileage estimates as the two-door version, and it’s not great: 15/19 mpg city/highway. Those estimates were consistent with my experience, but again, I didn’t drop the top. I should also note that I tend to get better mileage than most of my driving friends.\n\nThere are four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, and I found stopping performance to be strong, predictable and easy to modulate. That’s a nice thing to have in a vehicle that probably shouldn’t be storming down highway off-ramps.\n\nRide & Handling\nI stuck to pavement for the majority of my drive, so I can’t speak to the Wrangler Unlimited’s credibility as an offroad vehicle. One thing that did surprise me was how nice the ride was. It made short work of the absolutely terrible roads here in Chicago and was comfortable at speed on the highway. There was some wandering from side to side, but it didn’t bounce up and down like a porpoise, as older CJ-Series Jeeps did.\n\nThe handling was also just OK, but you have to remember that this is a vehicle designed for offroad service. You don’t want to take it to a slalom course. One thing that stood out to me and another reviewer was a large amount of play in the steering wheel. The Wrangler Unlimited lacks the pinpoint response of other vehicles, but I got used to it.\n\nOverall, it’s a vehicle that demands you pay extra attention to a few things: How fast you’re going, where you are in your lane and what’s going on around you when you’re on the highway. That’s not necessarily a bad thing if you’re an experienced driver, just know that this car demands more attention than many other cars out there.\n\nFeatures\nWhat did our rough, tough, rock-bashing machine come with as far as options? A navigation system and the optional Infinity sound system. The navigation system was nice, though I believe I’m in the minority in preferring a knob-based system to this model’s touch-screen interface.\n\nI didn’t like the Infinity sound system, but it should be noted I’m not an audiophile. I didn’t notice any need for a boost in sound when cruising at highway speed with the soft-top attached, but I did notice all the room the subwoofer ate up in the cargo area. Maybe with the top removed the extra oomph from the stereo is warranted — and wanted.\n\nA truly nice touch was the YES Essentials odor- and stain-resistant seat material. I didn’t test it extensively, but it’s a nice thing to have when you’re always out working up a sweat.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, our preferred source for crash-test data, ranks the Wrangler Unlimited Good in frontal-offset crash tests. Models without side-impact airbags are rated Marginal in side-impact tests. (The front-seat-mounted side airbags are a $490 option, and the Wrangler Unlimited was not tested with them.) IIHS has not tested the Wrangler Unlimited for rear crash protection.\n\nAll Jeep Wrangler Unlimiteds come with antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nWrangler Unlimited in the Market\nThe Wrangler Unlimited — all Wranglers, really — hold a rare space in the market. There aren’t too many vehicles that let you zip off the top, cruise campus, then go climb a mud wall. For some, those abilities — and its cool factor — forgive all other Wrangler sins. The fact that Wrangler drivers can now more comfortably carry more passengers and gear is just all the better.\n\nThis car is an offroad niche vehicle, and it’s hard to find fault with how it fills that niche. It’s when the Wrangler Unlimited is compared to other small SUV — most notably car-based models — that you start to notice some shortcomings. It’s not particularly easy to load stuff into, thanks to a high load floor and a swing-out rear gate that makes loading items a pain. The mileage isn’t great, and our test vehicle — while loaded with some nice things — stickered at $34,290.\n\nIn the end, I think you have to be honest with yourself before you decide to buy this car. Do you have a real need to go off-road? Do you regularly carry big, bulky items? Is it OK if you’re not pampered all the time? If so, the Wrangler Unlimited is worth considering and saving up for — it’s designed to fill that niche. But if you need a car for a long highway commute, that’s not the niche the Wrangler Unlimited is really best at filling. If you do decide to go that route, just be prepared to make tradeoffs in mileage, high-speed stability in turns and a lack of luxury in the cabin.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s wildly popular 4×4. It’s available as a two- or four-door SUV, the latter known as the Wrangler Unlimited. The two-door model has room for four people, while the Unlimited version seats five. \n\nA standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine pairs with a six-speed manual transmission; an eight-speed automatic is available. There’s also an optional 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that delivers 295 pounds-feet of torque; it pairs with the eight-speed automatic. A turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 that works with an eight-speed automatic is also available for the Wrangler Unlimited. Finally, a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that makes 375 hp and offers around 25 miles of all-electric range is new for 2021. \n\nFour-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for serious off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Land Rover Defender, Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nJeep has broadened the Wrangler’s powertrain lineup with a newly available plug-in hybrid drivetrain, found in the 4xe model. Featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, two electric motors, a 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack and an eight-speed automatic transmission, Jeep says the Wrangler 4xe is still fully capable off-road. \n\nOther Wrangler updates include an available forward-facing camera on models with the 8.4-inch touchscreen, plus new 80th Anniversary and Islander models with unique features and trim. Rubicon models gain Off-Road Plus, which adjusts throttle, transmission and traction-control settings.\n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nFour-wheel drive\nFolding soft-top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower locks, windows and mirrors\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nRemote start\nAir conditioning\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nAlpine premium stereo\n7- or 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\n2021 Jeep Wrangler Vs. 2021 Toyota 4Runner: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Wrangler and 4Runner are legends among fans of off-roading, but there are some major differences between these two SUVs. To start, the Wrangler is available in two- and four-door form, while the 4Runner is only available as a four-door SUV. With four- and six-cylinder engines, along with diesel and plug-in hybrid powertrains, the Wrangler also offers more choices under the hood; the 4Runner’s sole engine is a 270-hp V-6. The 4Runner can seat up to seven with an available third row, and it does offer a rear-wheel-drive version if you don’t plan on venturing off-road. In terms of ride and handling, these SUVs are fairly evenly matched, but both are less comfortable and don’t handle as well as similarly sized SUVs. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model lacks creature comforts like standard power windows and power locks, but still starts around $30,000 — and the Wrangler Unlimited is even pricier. For your money, you’ll get a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road. Better still, the latest Wrangler is better behaved than its predecessor on paved roads.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed 2024 Jeep Wrangler features several subtle but significant upgrades that bring more capabilities and improve safety without upsetting the fundamental Wrangler experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Wrangler’s primary competitor, the Ford Bronco, has been making sales inroads of late, but the Jeep’s enhancements for 2024 should help keep it fully competitive with its main rival.\n\nThe current-generation Jeep Wrangler debuted for the 2018 model year, bringing a higher level of sophistication and refinement to a time-honored off-road icon. Jeep actively expanded the Wrangler’s roster over the last five years, adding the EcoDiesel V-6 engine for 2020 and the 4xe plug-in hybrid and outrageous 470-horsepower Rubicon 392 for 2021. The Wrangler has long enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the serious off-roader market, but that changed when Ford launched its long-awaited revival of its storied Bronco for 2021, taking direct aim at the Wrangler.\n\nRelated: 2024 Jeep Wrangler: Tech Overhaul, Capability Gains, New Base 4xe\n\nThe Wrangler was already due for a refresh, and the challenge of a fresh rival with some nostalgic heritage of its own surely lit an extra fire under Jeep’s engineers and product planners. So, for 2024, the Wrangler lineup receives a number of welcome upgrades and new features, chief among them a new infotainment system and a couple of key safety items. I drove a handful of 2024 Wranglers and sampled several of these enhancements at the brand’s press preview event in St. George, Utah. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nPowertrains Stand Pat\n\nThe Wrangler’s powertrain lineup and basic trim-level hierarchy carries over for the most part. The 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 engine was phased out during the 2023 model year, but the 285-hp, 3.6-liter gas V-6 remains standard in most trims, with the 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder optional. Power-hungry types (with a lot of disposable income) can still choose the Rubicon 392 and its 470-hp, 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. The 4xe PHEV gains a new entry-level Sport S trim with a starting price of $51,790 (all prices include destination), shaving almost $5,000 off the PHEV’s price of entry. There’s also a new Rubicon X variant that comes standard with 35-inch tires, an integrated off-road camera and a steel front bumper.\n\nI drove a few 4xes at the event; one of them had a full battery charge and delivered 22 miles of pure-electric driving range, meeting its 2023 EPA estimate. The 4xe’s electric-motor whir in all-electric driving is accompanied by a rather coarse exhaust note when the four-cylinder engine kicks in. I also took a Rubicon 392 on a challenging off-road trail, where its hairy-chested V-8 rumble delighted even if it was ridiculously overpowered for the driving tasks at hand. When you’re driving a Rubicon 392, some people (and probably you) won’t be able to resist the urge to grunt like Tim Allen when goosing the throttle pedal.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nInfotainment Improvements\n\nOne of the most noteworthy updates is apparent the minute you get inside a 2024 Wrangler: A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen running Jeep’s latest Uconnect 5 software replaces the 7- or 8.4-inch screens of the outgoing model. Jeep says the Uconnect 5 operating system is five times more powerful than Uconnect 4, and it’s upgradable via over-the-air updates. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is standard, and new features include the ability to program up to five driver profiles with customized presets for music, apps, seating position and climate controls.\n\nOn Wranglers equipped with navigation, the infotainment system gets the Trails Offroad trail guide feature — complete with maps and details like difficulty level, terrain types, camping amenities and availability of electric vehicle charging stations. The feature comes preloaded with about 200 trail guides, including 62 Jeep Badge of Honor trails, and offers a $39.99 annual subscription that unlocks more than 3,000 trail maps. We only got a brief demo of the system, but it looks like a genuine value add for die-hard off-road adventurers.\n\nThe new touchscreen is nicely integrated into the Wrangler’s signature flat-panel dashboard above its central physical controls. The larger display screen is a big plus in general, but especially when using the available front off-road camera. And thankfully, bright sunlight doesn’t affect the visibility of the display; you can still read the screen when you have your Wrangler’s top and doors off. The system’s response times are quick, and almost all features are easy to access via shortcuts and a menu bar that runs down the left side of the screen.\n\nInterior Improvements\n\nPrevious Wranglers all made do with manual front seats, but High Altitude and above trim levels now come with 12-way power-adjustable front seats; Jeep says the seats have been designed and tested to withstand the Wrangler’s maximum water-fording capability of 34 inches. These trims also get acoustic front glass, thicker carpet and sound-deadening foam for a 5-decibel reduction in ambient noise inside the cabin, though the Wrangler is still one of the noisier vehicles on the market due to its boxy shape, removable top and, typically, off-road-focused tires.\n\nDash-top accessory mounting points are a subtle but clever update. They’re located under rubberized liners on two depressed areas atop the dashboard and can be used for aftermarket mounts for a smartphone, GoPro camera or what have you.\n\nOn the safety front, first- and second-row side curtain airbags are a new standard feature along with structural improvements for side impact performance. Along the same lines, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability go in Sport S and higher trims. A blind spot monitor with rear cross-path detection and rear parking sensors go in High Altitude and above trims and are available on other trims.\n\nExterior Updates\n\nIn addition to primarily cosmetic updates like the redesigned grille (with unique finishes on Willys, High Altitude and Sahara trims) and 10 new wheel designs across the lineup, there’s a welcome functional update: Instead of the old wire antenna mounted on the passenger-side front fender, the antenna is now integrated into the windshield. This is an especially nice feature for off-road driving — one less thing to snag on a tree branch or other obstacle along the trail.\n\nThe new grille retains the iconic Jeep seven-slot design, but it’s a bit shorter than before and has additional open areas between the slots for extra cooling; Jeep says these changes are to accommodate the factory-installed Warn winch that is newly available on the Rubicon. The winch has an 8,000-pound capacity (we watched it hoist a dune buggy out of a ravine during a demonstration at the press event). It costs $1,995 on Rubicon X and Rubicon 392 trims and $3,495 as part of an option package on regular Rubicons that also includes steel bumpers; not cheap, but there is the extra piece of mind that comes with a fully validated factory installation of a popular aftermarket item.\n\nOther Upgrades\n\nRubicons also get a more capable rear axle — a full-float Dana 44 HD unit that enables tire upsizing by customers and increases maximum towing capacity from 3,500 pounds to 5,000 pounds. Jeep had a Rubicon hooked up to a 4,300-pound Airstream trailer for us to tow on the press event, and it did so without breaking a sweat.\n\nAll 4xe variants will offer a Power Box adapter that plugs into the external charging port, enabling external devices to run off the vehicle’s battery. The Power Box includes four household outlets and supports 30 amps of total output; it comes standard on Sahara, Rubicon, Rubicon X and High Altitude 4xe variants; Sport S and Willys 4xe trims will offer the Power Box as an option later in the model year. The Power Box strikes us as a handy accessory for camping or tailgating — Jeep representatives were using one to power a widescreen TV at the press event, and the cable is long enough to position the box several feet away from the vehicle.\n\nAll of these upgrades and new features don’t change the fundamental personality or driving characteristics of the Wrangler, they just make it a little bit more capable and up to date … and a little more competitive against those pesky Broncos.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRefreshed 2024 Jeep Wrangler Starts at $33,690\n2024 Jeep Wrangler Up Close: Beefier, Safer, More Capable\n2024 Jeep Wrangler Vs. 2023 Ford Bronco Specs Comparison\nResearch the 2024 Jeep Wrangler\nShop for a 2024 Jeep Wrangler\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s long-serving 4×4, available as a two- or four-door SUV (the latter of which was formerly known as the Wrangler Unlimited). The two-door model has room for four people, while the four-door version seats five. A standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine works with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. Other available engines include a 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. There’s also the Wrangler 4xe, which comes only as a four-door and has a plug-in hybrid four-cylinder powertrain that makes 375 hp and provides an electric-only driving range of up to 22 miles, according to the EPA. Four-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for more intense off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Ford Bronco, Toyota 4Runner and Land Rover Defender. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the four-door Wrangler has 18.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nPower locks and windows are finally standard for 2025. (The Wrangler’s removable doors necessitate a quick-release wiring connector for in-door electrical components, which makes Jeep’s omission of these otherwise almost universal accessories until now understandable.) A new available Active Cabin Ventilation feature allows customers to air out their Wranglers remotely via the Jeep app. Also new for 2025 is a Wrangler 4xe Willys ’41 Special Edition, which honors the model’s World War II roots with military-inspired paint, interior and wheels. The V-8-powered Rubicon 392 is no more, but Jeep says its brawny 6.4-liter V-8 engine will get one more year of life in the fully loaded 392 Final Edition trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPower locks and windows \nFolding soft top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nHard top with power-retractable roof panel\nRemote start\nAutomatic climate control\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nAlpine premium stereo\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model starts at almost $34,000 and the more practical four-door Wrangler is even pricier, but both lack basic modern tech, including forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. What you get for your money, though, is a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s long-serving 4×4. It’s available as a two- or four-door SUV, the latter formerly known as the Wrangler Unlimited. The two-door model has room for four people, while the four-door version seats five. \n\nA standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine works with a six-speed manual transmission or eight-speed automatic. Other available engines include a 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder; a 260-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6; and a 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. The Wrangler 4xe comes only as a four-door and has a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that lets the SUV travel up to 22 miles on electric power alone, according to EPA estimates.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for serious off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Ford Bronco, Land Rover Defender and Toyota 4Runner. The four-door Wrangler offers 18.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nA military-themed Freedom model joins the lineup for a limited time, along with a few other specially trimmed models. The turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 engine is being phased out this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nFolding soft top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower locks, windows and mirrors\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nRemote start\nAir conditioning\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nAlpine premium stereo\n7- or 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model lacks creature comforts like power windows, air conditioning and power locks, but it still starts at almost $33,000, and the more practical four-door Wrangler is even pricier. What you get for your money, though, is a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road.",
