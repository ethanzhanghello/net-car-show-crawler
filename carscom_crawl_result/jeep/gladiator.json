      "expert_review": "The verdict: As a Jeep that’s also a pickup truck, the Gladiator works beautifully. As a pickup alone, it’s less successful.\n\nVersus the competition:  If you need a capable mid-size pickup that goes off-road or a four-season convertible with a utility bed, the Gladiator is hard to beat — but unless you want those things, other trucks are more comfortable on-road, handle better, are quieter and are far less expensive.\n\nThe new 2020 Jeep Gladiator, the Jeep brand’s return to the pickup truck market after an absence of 27 years, might look like a Wrangler with a pickup bed, but Jeep insists that it’s so much more than that: Less than half of the parts in the Gladiator (“JT” platform) are shared with the latest Wrangler (“JL”), and we can now state that it doesn’t really drive like a Wrangler either. Given the truck’s increased capabilities over Jeep’s iconic four-wheel-drive SUV, it’s safe to say that the Gladiator is much more a pickup truck than simply a modified SUV.\n\nRelated: 2020 Pickup Truck of the Year\n\nDon’t Worry About How It Looks\n\nLet’s get one thing out of the way right off the bat: Yes, it looks a little odd. Theproportions are just not quite right, are they? Like the bed is a little too short, or the four-door cab is just a bit too long, or maybe the rear axle isn’t quite in the right place. From the front, back or even quarter view, this isn’t apparent. In fact, from the front, the Gladiator doesn’t look any different from the Wrangler, but it is; the grille features larger slat openings for better cooling, necessitated by the Gladiator’s higher tow rating. But when you look at the Gladiator’s profile, it’s obvious that Jeep engineers and stylists had a challenge making the Wrangler work on a pickup frame. It’s by no means a deal-killer — everybody thought that the first four-door Wrangler Unlimited looked bizarre, too, when the JK was introduced in 2006.\n\nRegardless of how it looks, the driving experience is at once familiar and a little bit surprising. It’s longer than the Wrangler JL, thanks to a slightly stretched wheelbase that allows it to keep the Wrangler cab while still adding a 5-foot cargo bed. It’s heavier than the Wrangler, from 350 pounds on the base model to 590 pounds on the Rubicon, due to the extra structural reinforcement and beefier components required to boost the payload and tow ratings. It has a different rear suspension entirely, a five-link coil-spring setup that borrows liberally from the Ram 1500 pickup. The rear brakes are 5 percent bigger than the Wrangler’s, it has Dana 44 heavy-duty axles front and rear like the Wrangler Rubicon (every other Wrangler trim has a Dana 30 front axle), and the wheels are chunkier to support the Gladiator’s higher weight rating.\n\nOn-Road Adequacy\n\nAll of this adds up to two notable sensations — first, this is the best-riding Wrangler-derived vehicle ever made. No Wrangler rides this smoothly, with this level of bump-absorbing skill. Rough pavement, no problem. Rocky field, won’t be bothered. Smooth interstates, feels like a Lexus. The long wheelbase and the heavier-duty suspension smooth out just about everything without the bouncy feel that plagues the Ford Ranger FX4 or Chevrolet Colorado Z71. Of course, this on-road evaluation was made in the Overland trim, the most luxurious and on-road-friendly version of the Gladiator, with large, pavement-oriented tires that still performed beautifully in the deep, slippery, muddy two-track ruts along our drive route. Do it in a Rubicon trim Gladiator and it’s less enjoyable, but not much less.\n\nThe second main sensation is one of heft. The Gladiator is longer and heavier than the Wrangler, which — combined with the solid front axle — translates into a big, high-riding truck that isn’t all that thrilled being pushed quickly on tight, twisty mountain roads. The steering feel is exactly like that of a Wrangler JL — light on effort, but light on feedback. It’s largely isolated and fairly numb, which is exactly what you want on an off-roader that might throw some violent steering wheel motions back at you if you put a wheel wrong and hit a rock or rut, but which isn’t all that pleasant when you’re trying to hustle the Gladiator along a winding valley two-lane road. This is one of the main reasons that it didn’t place higher in our comparison of the Gladiator Overland versus other on-road-oriented mid-size pickups. That floaty handling is something you accept in a Jeep Wrangler, but it’s less acceptable in a pickup, regardless of the brand badge.\n\nThe acceleration from the 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 is adequate, but not what one would classify as rapid. It is outgunned considerably by the turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder and 10-speed automatic that are standard in the newest Ford Ranger, which is lighter, torquier and much more responsive than the Gladiator’s powertrain. The Gladiator comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission that’s smooth, direct and has excellent shift quality, but you’ll be shifting it a lot to keep the truck in the engine’s powerband — better you should opt for the excellent eight-speed automatic transmission and leave the shifting to Jeep.\n\nIf you want the maximum towing ability, you’ll need the eight-speed and the Sport S trim level. It has a maximum tow rating of 7,650 pounds when properly equipped. I towed a 24-foot, 6,000-pound Airstream camper trailer for a few miles and aside from a noticeable squat to the Gladiator’s ride, it was able to accomplish this task well enough. A trailer this large does tend to push the truck around in windy conditions, and the floaty steering and smallish side mirrors don’t do much to engender confidence. The 3.6-liter V-6 also has to work harder than I’ve ever heard one work, routinely holding lower gears and revving into the 4,000-6,000 rpm range and keeping it there on long uphill stretches. Strangely, there’s no Tow/Haul mode for the automatic transmission, an odd omission on a vehicle that specifically bills itself as built for towing.\n\nStick to more sedate cruising in the Gladiator, and you’ll be a lot happier. The standard high-quality soft top comes down easily, with a removable rear window, two snap-off quarter panels and a quick unlatch and toss back of the folding top. Just like the latest Wrangler, there are no zippers, only tongue-and-groove channels. It looks a little odd with the top retracted, since the Jeep designers’ goal was to keep the top from intruding on the bed space. Instead, it stops at the very back of the cab, above the rear window opening, looking like some kind of tall spoiler. Two composite hard tops are available, one in black and one in body color, each removable in three pieces like a Wrangler Freedom Top. And just like the Wrangler, the doors come off and the windshield folds down. Take everything off, turn it into the world’s only naked convertible pickup, and go blast across the desert scrub — and all of the Gladiator’s on-road ills evaporate in a cloud of dust (that quickly envelops you and trashes the interior).\n\nThe Off-Road Mastery\n\nAll of the Gladiator’s porkiness disappears as soon as the pavement does. Off-road, the Gladiator displays the same absolute domination of the environment that the Wrangler does, with systems, technology and designs that help it conquer whatever challenge you throw it into. We’ve driven the Gladiator off-road a number of times, both on media launch drives and our own head-to-head competition versus the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison. We have driven through some seriously deep mud pits, made dramatic ascents and descents of slippery, jagged rock piles, blasted through loose pea gravel, sailed over high-speed whoop-de-dos, crawled over steep rock tables that we scraped the chassis on and traversed some terrain that you would have extreme difficulty even walking over. Despite its added length over the Wrangler, the Gladiator handled it all with ease, thanks to a multitude of systems designed to help you get wherever you need to go. Suffice it to say that it does virtually everything a Wrangler can do off-road, which is more than any other off-road mid-size pickup truck can do, according to our testing.\n\nThe top-spec Gladiator is the Rubicon trim, just like on the Wrangler, and it features all of the bells and whistles that make Jeeps unparalleled in their off-road ability. Front and rear electronic locking differentials, electronic sway-bar disconnects, a super-low crawl ratio for the transfer case, an extra inch of suspension lift versus lesser Sport, Sport S and Overland trims, and something new and currently exclusive to Gladiator: Off-Road Mode Plus. If you engage this button while in 4-High, it will assume you’re driving through sand, and adjust the throttle and stability control settings accordingly; if you engage it while in 4-Low, it assumes you’re traversing rocky, low-speed terrain and adjusts the systems for that. We wouldn’t be surprised to see this feature eventually make its way over to the Wrangler, too — it’s just software and a button, so no reason it shouldn’t.\n\nAll About That Bed\n\nBut if all you cared about was cruising around without doors and climbing mountain trails, you’d be buying a Wrangler. The reason for the Gladiator is that 5-foot, all-steel pickup bed. It may not be as long as the extended beds on the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon or Ford Ranger, but it’s meant more for lifestyle buyers than work truck owners, and for them Jeep has designed the bed quite well.\n\nThe tailgate, for instance, has two open positions: fully open, and tilted out slightly thanks to some clever cable stays. When in the slightly open position, one can slip several sheets of the proverbial 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets into the bed, resting atop the wheel wells where the box is wider. A spray-in bedliner is optional and there are several tie-down points, an available rack system and myriad Mopar accessory parts meant for securing anything from bikes or motorcycles to kayaks or surfboards in back. A soft tonneau cover can be had that locks with the liftgate but can be opened partially to allow carrying of long planks of wood. The Gladiator is expensive enough that you’re not going to see these outfitted as cheap tradesman work trucks; they’re going to be snapped up by lifestyle buyers who use them as toy haulers and go-anywhere fun buggies, and for those buyers, the bed’s size is likely to be perfectly adequate.\n\nAs Expected, It’s Not Cheap\n\nWhich brings us to one of the most frequently asked questions about the new Gladiator: How much will it cost? The sticker price starts at $35,040 for a basic 2020 Gladiator Sport trim; all prices include a whopping $1,495 destination fee. Why Jeep requires $500 more to ship a Gladiator from Toledo than Mercedes-Benz asks to ship a G-Wagen from Austria, we cannot fathom. From there, the better-equipped Sport S goes for $38,240, the luxurious Overland starts at $41,890, while the king-of-the-hill Rubicon starts at $45,370. For those keeping score, that’s a $2,000 across-the-board premium over the 2019 Wrangler four-door, trim by trim. If you option one up like a Wrangler, a loaded Gladiator Rubicon would top out in the mid-$60,000 range. Load it up with additional parts and accessories from Jeep’s Mopar catalog, and you can top $70,000, which is simply astonishing.\n\nThat’s some serious luxury truck money, and well beyond the top end of any of its competitors like the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison, Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro or Ford Ranger Lariat FX4. Is it worth it? Well, it’s essentially in a class of one — there is no other pickup truck in the world that can do what the Gladiator can do off-road or on-road while offering tons of technology and the ability to turn the thing into a topless, doorless, windshield-less dune buggy in a matter of minutes. Until a competitor comes along that can match the Gladiator for its massive abilities and unique amenities, it rests comfortably and expensively in a category of its own.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Sport base trim gets standard 7-inch touchscreen, replacing the 5-inch display; Overland, Rubicon and Mojave swap in 8.4-inch touchscreen with integrated navigation; new Altitude trim introduced, while 80th Anniversary and Freedom Editions are no longer available\n\nPricing: $36,910 for the Sport up to $54,105 for the range-topping High Altitude (all prices include destination charge); 2022 price increases range from $300 to $2,335\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2021 or 2022? Those shopping lower trim levels should opt for the 2022 model’s upgraded multimedia system. Shoppers considering the Overland, Rubicon or Mojave trims can save substantially with a 2021 model if the built-in navigation and largest touchscreen aren’t necessary. All remaining trims carry over unchanged and offer a better value for 2021.\n\nIntroduced for the 2020 model year, the Gladiator blends Jeep’s off-road resume with the utility of a cargo bed for a unique offering among mid-size pickup trucks. The pickup enters its third year largely unchanged, with a handful of tech upgrades on select models and a condensed list of available trims. What does change is the 2022 Gladiator’s price tag, which increases anywhere from a few hundred bucks to more than $2,000 depending on the trim.\n\nRelated: 2020 Jeep Gladiator Review: Unique, Expensive and Massively Entertaining\n\nWhat’s New for 2022?\n\nThe most notable change for the 2022 Gladiator comes in its tech offerings. Base models now get Jeep’s latest Uconnect 4 system, which has a 7-inch touchscreen in lieu of the 2021 model’s Uconnect 3 system and 5-inch screen. Previously offered as a package option, Uconnect 4C, which swaps in an 8.4-inch screen with navigation, will be standard on Overland, Rubicon and Mojave models. Those three also get a premium stereo upgrade and keyless access; both features are optional on lower trims.\n\nFeatures\n\n \n\n2021 Jeep Gladiator | Cars.com photo by Matt Barnes\n\nThe Gladiator is among the few light-duty vehicles on the U.S. market that still lacks standard automatic emergency braking, an important safety feature that automakers — including Jeep’s parent company — vowed back in 2016 to make standard by September 2022. To get it along with adaptive cruise control, shoppers will need to check the box for Jeep’s Advanced Safety Group Package, available on all trims.\n\nAll Gladiator variants come with a standard Sunrider folding soft-top roof with a sunroof feature; a Freedom hard top is optional. Lower trims have cloth seats; leather-trimmed seats are optional or standard in the top four trims, starting with the Overland.\n\nPowertrains\n2021 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon | Cars.com photo by Matt Barnes\n\nThe standard engine for all Gladiator models is a 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 285 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The base engine offers up a maximum 1,700-pound payload and 7,650-pound towing capacity with the available Max Towing Package.\n\nShoppers can swap the standard V-6 for a turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 260 hp and 442 pounds-feet of torque; the diesel offers a 1,325-pound payload capacity and a towing capacity that tops out at 6,500 pounds. The base V-6 comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission; an optional eight-speed automatic can pair with either engine. All Gladiator trims are available with full-time four-wheel drive.\n\nTrims and Pricing\n2021 Jeep Gladiator Mojave | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2022 Jeep Gladiator is on sale now, but shoppers still are likely to find 2021 models.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Jeep Gladiator is still one of the best (and coolest) off-road pickups you can buy, but you’ll pay (a lot) for its capability in reduced comfort, quietness, efficiency and refinement. \n\nVersus the competition: The Gladiator is certainly not the most comfortable, quiet, efficient or refined mid-size truck, but name me another pickup with a removable roof and doors. Go on, I’ll wait.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss the Jeep Gladiator as a long-wheelbase Wrangler with a pickup bed, because that’s essentially what it is — at least on paper. The experience, however, of driving and using a Gladiator is more than that. You still get all the fun parts of a Wrangler, like the removable roof and doors, super-butch military-inspired styling, a washable interior with drain plugs in the floor (just be careful about spraying the dashboard), and Jeep Wave interaction with other Wrangler and Gladiator drivers. Unfortunately, you also get Jeep’s now long-in-the-tooth Pentastar V-6 (the only engine offered), the vague handling and choppy ride of an off-road machine with solid axles front and rear, and the snap-together feel of the trim bits. \n\nFor the 2024 model year, the Gladiator gets most of the upgrades and updates that the 2024 Wrangler received, including a new dashboard with an updated Uconnect multimedia system, some overhead airbags, available power front seats and more. Unlike the Wrangler, you can also get a Mojave desert-runner trim level, which is the version I tested. It’s meant to go up against trucks like the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison and Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro. I drove a Gladiator Mojave for a week both on-road and off to see if the updates for the ‘24 model year have made the Gladiator more user-friendly, like they did for the Wrangler.\n\nRelated: Updated 2024 Jeep Gladiator Priced From $39,790\n\nIt Doesn’t Look Much Different\n\nThe Gladiator’s exterior changes for 2024 only involve things that could be easily changed. There’s a new seven-slot black grille that matches the ‘24 Wrangler’s, seven new wheel designs, a stealthily integrated windshield radio antenna and not much else that’s new. My test vehicle was a Mojave X trim, so it featured orange accents and tow hooks as opposed to the red ones on a Rubicon. Sarge Green paint looks amazing on any Jeep, but Mojave models (both the regular Mojave and the Mojave X) offer an optional green and black interior that just looks dynamite. The Mojave X also brings some fancier trim and features into the picture, such as a body-colored hard top and fender flares, Nappa leather upholstery and navigation. The script on the hood says “Mojave” in big block letters, but the circular badge on the fender says “Desert Rated” instead of Jeep’s traditional “Trail Rated.” It hints that there’s something about this Gladiator that’s a little different from Jeep’s more common Rubicon rock crawler.\n\nSpecial Go-Fast Bits\n\nWhat makes the Mojave special are the myriad bits underneath its stretched frame. Like all Gladiators, it uses a five-link coil spring rear suspension that’s a variant of what was used on the last-generation Ram 1500 pickup, along with rugged Dana 44 axles front and rear. But unlike other Gladiators, the Mojave comes with Fox 2.5-inch internal bypass shocks with remote reservoirs, Fox front hydraulic jounce bumpers, a 1-inch front lift, high-clearance fender flares and 33-inch all-terrain tires. It also has a selectable high-speed rear-locking differential that allows the rear wheels to be locked in 4-High mode, not just 4-Low like on most other Jeeps. All that is meant to help the Gladiator Mojave handle high-speed desert running far better than a Rubicon could, with components found in many other off-road trucks. The Gladiator’s Off-Road+ mode is also geared toward blasts across dunes and steppes. \n\nNone of this, however, means the Gladiator Mojave isn’t also a skilled rock crawler; it maintains much of the low-speed capability found in the Rubicon, though it does forgo the locking front differential and electronic disconnecting front sway bar found in that model. The Gladiator’s 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 is mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission, but my test vehicle came equipped with an optional $2,500 eight-speed automatic. Part-time four-wheel drive is standard on the Mojave, but upgrading to the Mojave X brings Selec-Trac full-time 4WD instead. \n\nThis powertrain combination is either tried and true or old and tired, depending on your perspective. To be fair, it’s probably a little of both; the Pentastar V-6 has been in production for a long time now, so its bugs are largely worked out and it’s a known quantity for steady power delivery, with plentiful parts availability. It’s also coarser than many newer V-6 engines, with less power and torque. It’s thirsty, too, with an EPA rating of 19 mpg combined with the automatic transmission and 18 mpg combined with the manual. Until a rumored 4xe plug-in hybrid version of the Gladiator arrives, however, this is what you’re stuck with — and it’s really not that bad. No one driving a Gladiator Mojave is expecting to win stoplight drag races anyway, so its poky acceleration and copious noise really aren’t issues. The fact that the Gladiator can tow up to 7,700 pounds when properly equipped, and that it comes with a standard 2.72:1 low-range transfer case, is more important to the truck’s mission. It is, after all, a pickup truck. It’s just a pickup truck that can also blast over unpaved roads and scale slippery rock outcroppings. \n\nBoth of which it does effortlessly. I drove the Mojave on some washboard, pockmarked back roads around southeast Michigan at elevated speeds, and I can report that its off-road desert suspension works beautifully in such conditions, keeping the Gladiator planted, stable and true. You feel plenty of surface imperfections in the cabin, and it’s definitely noisy, but the thing feels built to military spec, and you won’t feel afraid to use it for its intended purpose. Delicate this truck is not. \n\nIt’s also a skilled low-speed crawler, although a locking front differential would have been useful when I took it on an off-road course that was part of the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2024 Spring Rally in Elkhart Lake, Wis. (Due to plentiful rain in the days leading up to the event, the course had the consistency of chocolate pudding.) The Gladiator Mojave is still a Wrangler with an open trunk, though, with knobby off-road tires and a locking center and rear differential, so it was able to handle everything it slogged through with mucky aplomb. Wranglers might still be the ultimate Jeep, but this thing ain’t far behind. \n\nThe Gladiator handles much like a Wrangler on-road, too, with one notable difference: Ride quality is demonstrably better thanks to its longer wheelbase. The Gladiator’s upright, blocky construction still makes it feel like you’re piloting a sailboat down the highway, resulting in constant steering adjustments, and you’ll never forget that you’re driving one of the few remaining new vehicles with live axles front and rear — no independent front suspension here, unlike every other mid-size pickup on sale in the U.S. That affects everything about the vehicle, from how it drives to how it rides and stops. You’ll have to like the somewhat less refined driving experience that results if you’re going to regularly drive a Gladiator — or at least tolerate it as the price you pay for all the other neat stuff about the truck.\n\nThe Other Neat Stuff\n\nBecause there is a lot of other neat stuff that comes with a Gladiator, the foremost being its ability to turn into an open-air, street-legal dune buggy. It’s the only convertible pickup truck in the world, and the only one with doors that can be removed. This, of course, means the whole truck is built like a snap-together kit, which does lend itself to squeaks, rattles and a lot more wind noise than you’d get in something like a Chevrolet Colorado or Toyota Tacoma. But nothing beats the extraordinary feeling of wind-in-the-hair freedom you get when cruising “naked,” without a top or doors. \n\nThe rest of the interior is straight-up traditional Wrangler/Gladiator style, with the military-grade theme continuing inside. The Mojave trim is available with a green Nappa leather interior that looks fantastic, especially with the orange Mojave-exclusive trim bits. A new standard 12.3-inch touchscreen running the latest Uconnect infotainment system is the big news for 2024, and Uconnect still ranks as one of the best systems in the business to our eyes. Jeep hasn’t gone all touchscreen controls for its latest system, so there are thankfully still plenty of dedicated buttons and knobs for frequently used items, like audio, climate control and the 4WD system. A first for the Gladiator is the 2024 model’s available 12-way power front seats, something we’d always been told was impossible due to the Gladiator’s “hose-out” interior and water-fording capability. Standard side curtain airbags are new, mounted on the upper rails, but they present a problem for taller drivers: The airbags’ hard-plastic casings cut into headroom, so any lateral motion on a bumpy road or field will make you smack your temple into them. Repeatedly. Ouch. \n\nFront-seat room is adequate, if a little cramped for bigger people — the seat doesn’t scoot quite as far back as I would like for my 6-foot frame — but the backseat is about as comfy as a four-door Wrangler’s, with adequate legroom and occasional-use three-across seating. Fold those seats flat and you have extra storage room, but there’s no pass-through to the truck’s bed — unless you just take the top off and straddle the forward cargo box wall. The bed itself is smaller than most mid-size pickups’ cargo boxes, but with the tailgate lowered and a bed extender, you can accommodate longer items, like dirt bikes. \n\nIt Doesn’t Come Cheap\n\nLike all Wrangler-based Jeeps these days, the Gladiator does not come cheap, especially if you start optioning up a higher trim level with all the extra bells and whistles Jeep offers. A Gladiator Mojave X like this one starts at $64,890 (all prices include an eye-watering $1,895 delivery fee to get the truck to you from freakin’ Toledo, Ohio), but the as-tested price of my test truck was $71,320, which is an obscene amount of money for a vehicle like this. A Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison starts several thousand dollars less, and its top price is less expensive, as well. A new 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor is more than $7,000 less than a Gladiator Mojave X and has a far more potent powertrain and a more comfortable interior. But Jeep is banking on buyers spending more for the Gladiator’s open-air convertibility, which no other competitor can muster. If that’s really all you want from your Gladiator, however, there are far less expensive versions than the Mojave that can scratch that itch.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Jeep Gladiator Gets Many of the Wrangler’s Updates, But Not All\nHitting the Trails: Jeep Unveils 2024 Gladiator Texas Trail\nJeep Celebrates Eclipse With 2024 Gladiator NightHawk\nJeep Debuts 2024 Wrangler and Gladiator Jeep Beach Limited Editions\nShop for a 2024 Jeep Gladiator\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nThe Jeep Gladiator is a five-seat mid-size pickup with a reputation for off-road driving prowess; it’s essentially a long-wheelbase pickup version of Jeep’s popular Wrangler SUV. Under the hood is a 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 paired with an eight-speed automatic and four-wheel drive. Jeep makes part-time 4WD standard, with full-time 4WD optional. A broad range of trims and appearance options are available; at the top of the line are the rock-crawling Rubicon and a high-speed desert runner called Mojave. With its removable top and doors, the Gladiator is in something of a class of its own, but its traditional mid-size pickup rivals include the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford Ranger, GMC Canyon, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nAfter a mild refresh for the 2024 model year, the Gladiator loses its six-speed manual transmission for 2025; an eight-speed automatic is now the sole transmission. Among other minor updates is a new Dark Sky Appearance Package that adds some of the Mojave trim’s visual touches to other versions. Jeep has stated that the Wrangler’s 4xe plug-in hybrid powertrain will be added to the Gladiator lineup in the 2025 calendar year; it will likely arrive as a 2026 model.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Gladiator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nFolding soft top\nRemovable doors\nFold-down windshield\n17-inch steel wheels\n32-inch all-season tires\nUnderbody skid plates\nTwo-speed transfer case\nTow hooks\nPush-button start\nEight-speaker audio system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nThree-piece hardtop\nPower-adjustable side mirrors\nLimited-slip differential\nRock rails\nFox shock absorbers\n33-inch all-terrain tires\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n7-inch digital instrument cluster\nNavigation\nAmbient interior lighting\nElectronically disconnecting front stabilizer bar\nOne-inch lift kit\nFront-facing off-road camera\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nThe Jeep Gladiator makes a lot of sense for mid-size pickup truck shoppers who intend to regularly venture off-road and crave the open-air fun of a convertible. Quite simply, short of Jeep’s own Wrangler SUV, there are few (if any) vehicles with this degree of rock-crawling capability. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it comes at a significant premium over traditional mid-size pickups. Cabin noise is another issue, as is numb steering feel and a relatively tight passenger cabin. On the plus side, with so many trims and options, you’ll likely never see two identical versions of the Gladiator. Its infotainment system is also one of the best in the business, with clear graphics and simple menus.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nThe Jeep Gladiator is a mid-size crew-cab pickup truck with room for five people. It has a standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. An optional 260-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 pairs with an eight-speed automatic. Part-time four-wheel drive is standard, and competitors include the Ford Ranger, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma. You can see how the Gladiator scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nA specially trimmed Freedom variant includes a winch-capable steel front bumper and steel rock rails, LED headlamps and foglamps, body-color fender flares, black wheels and body-side American flag decals. A Capability Package for the High Altitude trim includes a winch-capable steel front bumper, steel rock rails and a front off-road camera. The Willys trim gets additional standard content, including keyless entry, remote start and a universal garage door opener.\n\nWhich Features in the 2023 Jeep Gladiator Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nFolding soft top\nFold-down windshield\nRemovable doors\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nCruise control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nThree-piece hard top\nSpray-in bedliner\nHousehold power outlet in cargo box\nAdjustable cargo tie-downs\nPower locks, mirrors and windows\nRemote start\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAlpine premium stereo\n8.4-inch touchscreen navigation system\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Gladiator?\n\nThe Jeep Gladiator is a unique entrant in the mid-size pickup truck class. The off-road Rubicon version has the rock-crawling ability of a muscled-up mountain goat, but the Gladiator’s poor straight-line tracking is a problem when driving on paved surfaces. It’s also expensive, especially in uplevel trims.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: As a Jeep that’s also a pickup truck, the Gladiator works beautifully. As a pickup alone, it’s less successful.\n\nVersus the competition:  If you need a capable mid-size pickup that goes off-road or a four-season convertible with a utility bed, the Gladiator is hard to beat — but unless you want those things, other trucks are more comfortable on-road, handle better, are quieter and are far less expensive.\n\nThe new 2020 Jeep Gladiator, the Jeep brand’s return to the pickup truck market after an absence of 27 years, might look like a Wrangler with a pickup bed, but Jeep insists that it’s so much more than that: Less than half of the parts in the Gladiator (“JT” platform) are shared with the latest Wrangler (“JL”), and we can now state that it doesn’t really drive like a Wrangler either. Given the truck’s increased capabilities over Jeep’s iconic four-wheel-drive SUV, it’s safe to say that the Gladiator is much more a pickup truck than simply a modified SUV.\n\nRelated: 2020 Pickup Truck of the Year\n\nDon’t Worry About How It Looks\n\nLet’s get one thing out of the way right off the bat: Yes, it looks a little odd. Theproportions are just not quite right, are they? Like the bed is a little too short, or the four-door cab is just a bit too long, or maybe the rear axle isn’t quite in the right place. From the front, back or even quarter view, this isn’t apparent. In fact, from the front, the Gladiator doesn’t look any different from the Wrangler, but it is; the grille features larger slat openings for better cooling, necessitated by the Gladiator’s higher tow rating. But when you look at the Gladiator’s profile, it’s obvious that Jeep engineers and stylists had a challenge making the Wrangler work on a pickup frame. It’s by no means a deal-killer — everybody thought that the first four-door Wrangler Unlimited looked bizarre, too, when the JK was introduced in 2006.\n\nRegardless of how it looks, the driving experience is at once familiar and a little bit surprising. It’s longer than the Wrangler JL, thanks to a slightly stretched wheelbase that allows it to keep the Wrangler cab while still adding a 5-foot cargo bed. It’s heavier than the Wrangler, from 350 pounds on the base model to 590 pounds on the Rubicon, due to the extra structural reinforcement and beefier components required to boost the payload and tow ratings. It has a different rear suspension entirely, a five-link coil-spring setup that borrows liberally from the Ram 1500 pickup. The rear brakes are 5 percent bigger than the Wrangler’s, it has Dana 44 heavy-duty axles front and rear like the Wrangler Rubicon (every other Wrangler trim has a Dana 30 front axle), and the wheels are chunkier to support the Gladiator’s higher weight rating.\n\nOn-Road Adequacy\n\nAll of this adds up to two notable sensations — first, this is the best-riding Wrangler-derived vehicle ever made. No Wrangler rides this smoothly, with this level of bump-absorbing skill. Rough pavement, no problem. Rocky field, won’t be bothered. Smooth interstates, feels like a Lexus. The long wheelbase and the heavier-duty suspension smooth out just about everything without the bouncy feel that plagues the Ford Ranger FX4 or Chevrolet Colorado Z71. Of course, this on-road evaluation was made in the Overland trim, the most luxurious and on-road-friendly version of the Gladiator, with large, pavement-oriented tires that still performed beautifully in the deep, slippery, muddy two-track ruts along our drive route. Do it in a Rubicon trim Gladiator and it’s less enjoyable, but not much less.\n\nThe second main sensation is one of heft. The Gladiator is longer and heavier than the Wrangler, which — combined with the solid front axle — translates into a big, high-riding truck that isn’t all that thrilled being pushed quickly on tight, twisty mountain roads. The steering feel is exactly like that of a Wrangler JL — light on effort, but light on feedback. It’s largely isolated and fairly numb, which is exactly what you want on an off-roader that might throw some violent steering wheel motions back at you if you put a wheel wrong and hit a rock or rut, but which isn’t all that pleasant when you’re trying to hustle the Gladiator along a winding valley two-lane road. This is one of the main reasons that it didn’t place higher in our comparison of the Gladiator Overland versus other on-road-oriented mid-size pickups. That floaty handling is something you accept in a Jeep Wrangler, but it’s less acceptable in a pickup, regardless of the brand badge.\n\nThe acceleration from the 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 is adequate, but not what one would classify as rapid. It is outgunned considerably by the turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder and 10-speed automatic that are standard in the newest Ford Ranger, which is lighter, torquier and much more responsive than the Gladiator’s powertrain. The Gladiator comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission that’s smooth, direct and has excellent shift quality, but you’ll be shifting it a lot to keep the truck in the engine’s powerband — better you should opt for the excellent eight-speed automatic transmission and leave the shifting to Jeep.\n\nIf you want the maximum towing ability, you’ll need the eight-speed and the Sport S trim level. It has a maximum tow rating of 7,650 pounds when properly equipped. I towed a 24-foot, 6,000-pound Airstream camper trailer for a few miles and aside from a noticeable squat to the Gladiator’s ride, it was able to accomplish this task well enough. A trailer this large does tend to push the truck around in windy conditions, and the floaty steering and smallish side mirrors don’t do much to engender confidence. The 3.6-liter V-6 also has to work harder than I’ve ever heard one work, routinely holding lower gears and revving into the 4,000-6,000 rpm range and keeping it there on long uphill stretches. Strangely, there’s no Tow/Haul mode for the automatic transmission, an odd omission on a vehicle that specifically bills itself as built for towing.\n\nStick to more sedate cruising in the Gladiator, and you’ll be a lot happier. The standard high-quality soft top comes down easily, with a removable rear window, two snap-off quarter panels and a quick unlatch and toss back of the folding top. Just like the latest Wrangler, there are no zippers, only tongue-and-groove channels. It looks a little odd with the top retracted, since the Jeep designers’ goal was to keep the top from intruding on the bed space. Instead, it stops at the very back of the cab, above the rear window opening, looking like some kind of tall spoiler. Two composite hard tops are available, one in black and one in body color, each removable in three pieces like a Wrangler Freedom Top. And just like the Wrangler, the doors come off and the windshield folds down. Take everything off, turn it into the world’s only naked convertible pickup, and go blast across the desert scrub — and all of the Gladiator’s on-road ills evaporate in a cloud of dust (that quickly envelops you and trashes the interior).\n\nThe Off-Road Mastery\n\nAll of the Gladiator’s porkiness disappears as soon as the pavement does. Off-road, the Gladiator displays the same absolute domination of the environment that the Wrangler does, with systems, technology and designs that help it conquer whatever challenge you throw it into. We’ve driven the Gladiator off-road a number of times, both on media launch drives and our own head-to-head competition versus the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison. We have driven through some seriously deep mud pits, made dramatic ascents and descents of slippery, jagged rock piles, blasted through loose pea gravel, sailed over high-speed whoop-de-dos, crawled over steep rock tables that we scraped the chassis on and traversed some terrain that you would have extreme difficulty even walking over. Despite its added length over the Wrangler, the Gladiator handled it all with ease, thanks to a multitude of systems designed to help you get wherever you need to go. Suffice it to say that it does virtually everything a Wrangler can do off-road, which is more than any other off-road mid-size pickup truck can do, according to our testing.\n\nThe top-spec Gladiator is the Rubicon trim, just like on the Wrangler, and it features all of the bells and whistles that make Jeeps unparalleled in their off-road ability. Front and rear electronic locking differentials, electronic sway-bar disconnects, a super-low crawl ratio for the transfer case, an extra inch of suspension lift versus lesser Sport, Sport S and Overland trims, and something new and currently exclusive to Gladiator: Off-Road Mode Plus. If you engage this button while in 4-High, it will assume you’re driving through sand, and adjust the throttle and stability control settings accordingly; if you engage it while in 4-Low, it assumes you’re traversing rocky, low-speed terrain and adjusts the systems for that. We wouldn’t be surprised to see this feature eventually make its way over to the Wrangler, too — it’s just software and a button, so no reason it shouldn’t.\n\nAll About That Bed\n\nBut if all you cared about was cruising around without doors and climbing mountain trails, you’d be buying a Wrangler. The reason for the Gladiator is that 5-foot, all-steel pickup bed. It may not be as long as the extended beds on the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon or Ford Ranger, but it’s meant more for lifestyle buyers than work truck owners, and for them Jeep has designed the bed quite well.\n\nThe tailgate, for instance, has two open positions: fully open, and tilted out slightly thanks to some clever cable stays. When in the slightly open position, one can slip several sheets of the proverbial 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets into the bed, resting atop the wheel wells where the box is wider. A spray-in bedliner is optional and there are several tie-down points, an available rack system and myriad Mopar accessory parts meant for securing anything from bikes or motorcycles to kayaks or surfboards in back. A soft tonneau cover can be had that locks with the liftgate but can be opened partially to allow carrying of long planks of wood. The Gladiator is expensive enough that you’re not going to see these outfitted as cheap tradesman work trucks; they’re going to be snapped up by lifestyle buyers who use them as toy haulers and go-anywhere fun buggies, and for those buyers, the bed’s size is likely to be perfectly adequate.\n\nAs Expected, It’s Not Cheap\n\nWhich brings us to one of the most frequently asked questions about the new Gladiator: How much will it cost? The sticker price starts at $35,040 for a basic 2020 Gladiator Sport trim; all prices include a whopping $1,495 destination fee. Why Jeep requires $500 more to ship a Gladiator from Toledo than Mercedes-Benz asks to ship a G-Wagen from Austria, we cannot fathom. From there, the better-equipped Sport S goes for $38,240, the luxurious Overland starts at $41,890, while the king-of-the-hill Rubicon starts at $45,370. For those keeping score, that’s a $2,000 across-the-board premium over the 2019 Wrangler four-door, trim by trim. If you option one up like a Wrangler, a loaded Gladiator Rubicon would top out in the mid-$60,000 range. Load it up with additional parts and accessories from Jeep’s Mopar catalog, and you can top $70,000, which is simply astonishing.\n\nThat’s some serious luxury truck money, and well beyond the top end of any of its competitors like the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Bison, Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro or Ford Ranger Lariat FX4. Is it worth it? Well, it’s essentially in a class of one — there is no other pickup truck in the world that can do what the Gladiator can do off-road or on-road while offering tons of technology and the ability to turn the thing into a topless, doorless, windshield-less dune buggy in a matter of minutes. Until a competitor comes along that can match the Gladiator for its massive abilities and unique amenities, it rests comfortably and expensively in a category of its own.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
