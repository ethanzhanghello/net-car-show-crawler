      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn 2002, the Jeep division of DaimlerChrysler replaced the old Cherokee with a slightly larger sport utility vehicle called the Liberty. The Liberty’s diesel engine and Renegade trim have been dropped for 2007, and a new Jeep Green Metallic paint scheme has been added.\n\nAn electronic stability system and tire pressure monitoring system are standard.\n\nExterior\nPronounced trapezoidal wheel flares are integrated into the body, and a traditional seven-slot Jeep grille highlights the front. Short front and rear overhangs allow 36-degree approach and 31.5-degree departure angles for effective offroad driving.\n\nLiberty SUVs have a coil-spring independent front suspension and a solid rear axle with coil springs. The spare tire is mounted externally on a swing-out tailgate with flip-up glass. Wheels are 16 inches in diameter (17 inches on the Limited). Available skid plates cover the fuel tank and transfer case, and an optional Trailer Tow Group yields a 5,000-pound towing capacity.\n\nInterior\nEach Liberty seats up to five. A 65/35-split rear seat can be folded down with one hand. The instrument panel features round gauges. All models have a CD player. Limited models can be fitted with a DVD-based GPS navigation radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe sole engine is a 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 that produces 235 pounds-feet of torque. It teams with either a six-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The Liberty is offered with either rear- or four-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Side curtain airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSolidly constructed, the Liberty offers quick, precise steering with moderate effort and it’s a pleasant driving experience. The ride is surprisingly easygoing on smooth roads, and it doesn’t deteriorate much when the pavement gets rough.\n\nOffroad runs are amazing. Gnarled gravel paths seem almost like a paved parkway, though undulations may be more noticeable in the backseat.\n\nThough not exceptional, performance is more than adequate with the V-6 engine and automatic transmission. At low highway speeds, the Liberty occasionally exhibits awkward downshifting. Firm yet comfortable seats offer excellent support, and there is ample headroom and legroom. This SUV is nearly devoid of four-wheel-drive drone in low range.",

      "expert_review": "Texas Truck Mama smiled as she pulled into the driveway in her little Mini Cooper. Parked in front of her was a considerably different vehicle, a 2008 Jeep Liberty Limited sport-utility vehicle. It was twice the length of her Mini Cooper, several inches taller and nearly 900 pounds heavier.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Jeep Liberty, of course, had a bigger engine — a 3.7-liter, 210-horsepower V-6, compared with the 1.6-liter, 118-horepower in-line four-cylinder engine in her front-wheel-drive Mini.\n\nThe Jeep Liberty, wearing all-new sheet metal for 2008, looking rugged the way a Jeep should look, barely got 21 miles per gallon on the highway, drinking regular unleaded gasoline. Texas Truck Mama’s Mini got 36 mpg on the highway. And with her behind the wheel, driving like the mild-mannered elementary school teacher she normally is, squeezing 37 or 38 mpg out of her Mini was not uncommon, although she frequently complained about the Mini’s requirement for premium unleaded fuel.\n\nI mention these things in solicitation of help in figuring out the woman to whom I’ve been married for nearly 40 years.\n\nShe’s a little thing, barely standing five feet tall. She’s painfully sensible. Had it not been for her, we could’ve been a part of the mortgage mess that’s sinking the U.S. economy. She was an environmentalist before environmentalism was cool. And she’s so cheap she has an almost religious compulsion to return an item to a store if she discovers that she could have gotten the same thing from somewhere else for 10 cents less.\n\nBut when it comes to trucks in general and Jeeps in particular, the woman is insane. Fuel economy doesn’t matter. Her usual preference for small cars disappears. Bigger becomes better. Her mild demeanor is supplanted by a lust for power. Mary Anne — the sweetly smiling schoolteacher and gentle, churchgoing wife from Marshall, Tex. — becomes Texas Truck Mama.\n\n“It’s a Jeep! A Jeep!” she exclaimed as she pulled into the driveway.\n\nThen, for a moment, she returned to sobriety. She thought about Ria Manglapus, my associate in vehicle evaluations.\n\n“What’s Ria driving?” Mary Anne asked.\n\nLike, what, am I stupid?\n\n“Ria’s running the Infiniti M45X,” I said, thankful that the Infiniti had come a few hours before the Jeep Liberty arrived.\n\n“Oh, well, that’s good,” Mary Anne said. She backed her Mini out of the driveway and parked it on the street. “Where’s the Jeep key?” she asked. I gave it to her. She came inside, dropped her school bags on a living room couch . . . and left.\n\n“Errands,” she said.\n\nAnd it went that way for several days — Mini parked on the street, Mary Anne behind the wheel of the Jeep, until I reminded her that Ria and I weren’t reviewing the Mini.\n\nThat is when I discovered something else — that women generally seem nuts about Jeeps. For example, the women at Mary Anne’s school were almost as sad as Mary Anne when we took the Jeep away. “I really love that Jeep,” the school’s vice principal said in a tone that hinted accusation. And, then, Ria: “I thought I wasn’t going to get a chance to drive it,” she said, collecting the Jeep key and turning over the key to the Infiniti M45X.\n\nGo figure.\n\nThe Infiniti M45X is a premium luxury car — elegant, fast and powerful. The Jeep Liberty is, well, a Jeep. Its attractive new body does not conceal its essential nature, which is that of a utilitarian truck.\n\nThe 2008 Jeep Liberty feels better on the road than older Liberty models, the first of which went on sale in the United States six years ago. But there are many sport-utility rivals that have a smoother, more car-like, on-road ride.\n\nThe Jeep Liberty beats many competitors off-road. It is a mud-loving, rock-crawling vehicle if ever there was one. But neither Mary Anne, nor Ria, nor any of the women at Mary Anne’s school — nor I, for that matter — drove the 2008 Jeep Liberty off-road. We used it the way most Americans use sport-utility vehicles — as a station wagon.\n\nMy off-road experiences with Jeep Liberty SUVs were in previous versions. Judging from the mechanicals of the 2008 model — Command-Trac four-wheel-drive (in the tested version), four-wheel-independent suspension with solid live rear axle, hill descent control, electronic high-low gear selection and automatically locking hubs — the new Jeep Liberty has sacrificed none of its off-road prowess.\n\nBut if that prowess isn’t ever used, does it matter?\n\n“Yes,” said Texas Truck Mama. “It makes you feel like you could do something if you wanted to do something. It makes you feel powerful,” she said.",

One of the more interesting features in the five-seat Jeep Liberty small SUV is its optional Sky Slider movable canvas roof. Liberty competitors include the Nissan Xterra and Suzuki Grand Vitara.\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Liberty gets a system that shuts off the engine when decelerating to improve its gas mileage, as well as an indicator on the dash to show when the Liberty is being driven efficiently.\n\nExterior\nThe Liberty features Jeep’s traditional seven-slot grille and trapezoidal fender flares that enhance the vehicle’s side profile. Unlike many panoramic sunroofs offered today, Jeep’s Sky Slider roof is made of canvas rather than glass. The fabric roof folds on itself as it opens, and Jeep says the top is leak-proof.\n\nStandard automatic headlamps\nStandard body-colored grille, front and rear bumpers, and moldings\nStandard remote keyless entry\nOptional express-up windows\nStandard power, heated, folding mirrors\n16-, 17- or 18-inch wheels\nOptional roof rails\nOptional full-open canvas roof system\nOptional chrome grille\n\nInterior\nThe Liberty’s interior features a large floor console with cupholders, armrest and a storage area with a removable top tray.\n\nBoth the left and right rear panels in the cargo area have tie-down loops for securing items to the load floor. The left rear panel houses a concealed compartment for jack storage and tools.\n\nStandard power locks, windows and mirrors\nStandard floormats\nStain-resistant cloth or leather upholstery available\nOptional heated, powered front seats\nOptional leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nOptional hands-free communication system\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nFor 2010, the Liberty gets a standard fuel shut-off system that turns off fuel when the vehicle is decelerating. There’s also a standard fuel-saving indicator that lights up in the odometer to notify the driver when the vehicle is being driven in a fuel-efficient manner.\n\nAll models come with a four-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Liberty can tow up to 5,000 pounds.\n\n210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 with 235 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic transmission\nTrailer tow package that includes a full-size spare, Class III trailer hitch and trailer-sway control\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nOptional remote start\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard all-disc antilock braking system\nStandard electronic stability control with electronic roll mitigation and all-speed traction control\nStandard smart key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt\nOptional parking assist system includes a sonar-based warning system with audible and visual alerts",

      "expert_review": "I lived in Virginia for several years, and the history-drenched state did not give up its storied traditions easily. A running joke in the Old Dominion was: How many Virginians does it take to change a light bulb? It takes five; one to change it, and four to talk about how great the old bulb was.\n\nThat same line came up earlier this year when DaimlerChrysler announced that it would replace the venerable Jeep Cherokee — a sport-utility vehicle pioneer with roots dating to 1984 — with a new SUV, a compact called the Jeep Liberty.\n\nFor those mourning the loss of the Cherokee, I would recommend a philosophy with strong New York ties: Fuhgeddaboudit. The 2002 Liberty looks better, handles better and just is better than its predecessor.\n\nI had the good fortune to test drive one of the first Cherokees off the line years ago, and I remember thinking what a brave new world it was going to be now that vehicles like this were going to take the next evolutionary step up from the station wagon. In comparative terms, what I was driving then was a Ford Model T, given what the Liberty now offers.\n\nFor starters, the Liberty is much more attractive than the Cherokee. Amazingly, Cherokee’s looks did not change that much over the years — maybe an explanation behind a 14 percent sales decline in 2000 compared with 1999 figures.\n\nLiberty looks like a 21st century SUV — smooth, nicely rounded lines and a stylish grille that still manages to pay homage to the hard-working Jeep products of years past. Four doors open into an interior compartment that is not gigantic but certainly comfortable for five.\n\nThe package is simple and nicely priced. You can get Liberty as a Sport or a Limited model, with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. A 2WD Sport with a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder, 150-horsepower engine starts at $16,450. A 4WD Limited starts at $22,720.\n\nMy test Liberty fell somewhere outside the lines. It was a Sport model with four-wheel drive — with a base price of $17,960 — but it was dressed up with numerous options that ballooned the bottom line to $24,070. Some of the extras qualified as just that — lots of folks can do without deep-tint sunscreens and power sunroofs — but the 3.7-liter V-6 engine was worth every penny of its $850 cost.\n\nWith 210 horses to command, the Liberty handles all driving situations with relative ease. Off-road jaunts that would challenge many a small SUV were no problem for Liberty. Thank heaven! This is a Jeep after all.\n\nPerformance on surface streets and highways was robust. The Liberty held sharp, high-speed curves admirably — especially for a comparatively bargain-priced sport-ute.\n\nInside, the efforts of the V-6 certainly could be heard, but interior noise was not obtrusive.\n\nAlthough Liberty might look small from the outside, it’s no lightweight. It’s more than 1,000 pounds heavier than a Toyota RAV4, for example. Equipped with the proper trailering p ackage, my test Liberty was rated to tow 5,000 pounds.\n\nThe dash and cabin controls were easy to read and happily functional, although it’s a mystery to me why engineers put the power window buttons on the center console. There’s nothing like pulling up to a curbside mailbox and frantically searching for the driver’s window button while the motorist behind you leans on the horn. Being a left-hander, I figured the button placement was a massive conspiracy.\n\nSome have griped about the side-opening tailgate instead of the more-traditional lift-up configuration. I had no problem with it, especially given the fact that Liberty’s tailgate provides easy access to the rear-mounted spare tire.\n\nAlthough putting the spare underneath a vehicle makes for a cleaner look, I wonder how many people have burrowed into the snow or onto the scorching pavement to wrestle a spare out from under their SUV? Yes, other SUVs have a spare-tire holder that swings away so the tailgate can li up, but the Liberty’s tail section configuration is not enough to send me screaming into the woods.\n\nThe bottom line is that the bigger, stronger and more-nimble replacement for the Cherokee is a Liberty for all who crave SUV convenience but don’t want to take a second mortgage to buy into the game.\n\nMake/model: 2002 Jeep Liberty Sport 4WD.\n\nVehicle type: Five-seat, four-door sport-utility vehicle with four-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $17,960 (as tested, $24,070).\n\nEngine: 3.7-liter V-6 with 210 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute and 235 pounds/foot torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 miles per gallon city, 20 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power front discs, rear drum.\n\nSuspension type: Upper/lower A-arms, coil springs, gas-charged shocks and stabilizer bar on front; trailing upper A-arm, dual trailing lower arms, coil springs, gas-charged shocks and stabilizer bar on rear.\n\nCargo volume: 29 cubic feet behind rear seat; 69 cubic feet with seat folded down.\n\nFuel tank: 18.5 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 4,115 pounds.\n\nFront track: 60 inches.\n\nRear track: 59.7 inches.\n\nHeight: 73.2 inches.\n\nLength: 174.4 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 104.3 inches.\n\nWidth: 71.6 inches.\n\nGround clearance: 8 inches front, 7.8 inches rear.\n\nTires: P215/75R16 all-season tires.\n\nMaximum towing capacity: 5,000 pounds (with trailering package).\n\nFinal assembly site: Toledo, Ohio.",

      "expert_review": "The Jeep Liberty looks like one of those “cute utes,” small, all-wheel-drive machines destined for no more demanding work than cruising the lot at the local mall – not to say that can’t be an adventure.\n\nIt’s a little bulbous looking, and the proportions are such that it looks much smaller than it really is. I still find it hard to wrap my mind around the fact that it’s actually bigger than the Cherokee, which it has supplanted in the Jeep lineup. But it goes nearly 4,000 pounds in fighting trim, and stretches 174 inches, despite having a tidy 104-inch wheelbase.\n\nYou can make it less than a cute ute by ordering it with 2-wheel-drive and a four-cylinder engine (nuts, if you ask me – just get a station wagon and be done with it). At the other end of the spectrum, you can turn it into a wilderness-tamer par excellence by specifying either of two types of 4-wheel-drive mechanism and dropping a 3.7-liter V-6 under the hood.\n\nTo pump up the image and set it apart from the lightweights, DaimlerChrysler has created a Renegade version, borrowing the name from the all-conquering little brother, the Wrangler. This one is hard to miss, and it’s quite a handsome machine, perhaps too pretty for the serious slogging of which it’s capable.\n\nI was given one to play with, equipped with the six, a five-speed manual transmission and part-time 4-wheel drive. As the glamour boy of the family, it comes well-equipped for its $23,695 base price. It has leather seating, air conditioning, power windows and automatic door locks with keyless entry, 6-speaker AM-FM-CD stereo, cruise control, 12-volt power taps, rear wiper and washer and bags of other little pleasantries, even unto dual lighted vanity mirrors.\n\nLess obvious are the standard skid plates protecting the front suspension, transfer case and fuel tank, just in case someone should be so temerarious as to actually take it rock climbing.\n\nThere’s nothing subtle about the exterior design features which denote the Renegade as something special. Start with the outsized plastic fender flares that are affixed with protruding stainless steel bolts. They are there to let the world know the driver goes through heavy mud and gravel, as well as to protect the paint from such missiles.\n\nThe two-tone front bumper and unique alloy wheels are just for show.\n\nBut the crowning glory of this package, literally, is the light bar and roof basket. Four halogen lamps are mounted atop the vehicle, in black housings. For one thing, they raise the apparent height from just under 6 feet to about 6-4. They also bespeak a tendency to adventure where lighting is scarce. Strictly for off-road use, they deliver 150,000 candlepower to light a mountain trail or, as Jeep suggests, to provide illumination for a night game of beach volleyball. My neighborhood has no lights and a lot of stupid deer; the blaze of illumination scared them away and had neighbors reaching for their Uzis.\n\nThe “wet basket” aft of the lights is quite similar to the one on the Nissan Xterra, but it doesn’t obstruct the moonroof.\n\nThe Liberty is of unibody construction, which makes it more like a truck than a car, whose body is usually secured to a frame with lots of yielding substances in between. Jeep went the one-piece route for the solidity is supplies.\n\nAnd indeed, the Liberty appeared quite rigid as it negotiated nasty terrain that should have evinced some twisting feel. There were no groans or rattles during this work.\n\nHappily, the suspension engineering is such that the Liberty is still quite pleasant on paved surfaces, even the ones not so good as they ought to be. Minor disturbances are essentially ignored, and the major ones feel as if they’ve been beaten into submission. Jeep claims 8 inches of suspension travel; I found it not all that difficult to make it hit the jounce bumpers when taking whoop-de-dos a trifle fast. I suspect a serious off-roader would want to beef up this area, to the detriment of everyday ride quality.\n\nTwo engines are available on the Liberty, the six and a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder piece which might suffice for a 2WD version. It makes 150 hp at 5,200 rpm and 165 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000. For more serious work, though, the six is mandatory. It delivers 210 hp at 5,200 rpm along with 235 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000.\n\nThe curious thing about this powerplant is that, despite its overhead-valve construction, it has so little to give on the bottom end, by which I mean 2,500 rpm or less. If you try to accelerate from 2,000, you’ll have a long wait before the wind whistles by. Once it gets past 3,000, though, it feels more like an overhead-cammer, quite eager to play tag with the electronically governed 6,000-rpm redline. Both it and the exhaust are perhaps excessively loud, although the intended audience might disagree.\n\nAt one point in the upper reaches of the rev range, the dash panels evinced some sympathetic vibration, which, along with the engine’s raspy intake noises, was unpleasant. Jeep says regular unleaded suffices. EPA ratings are 16 mpg city, 22 highway with the 5-speed, 16/20 with the automatic. I got 17.7 with a bit of freeway work, a bit of quarry fun and a lot of country ambling.\n\nThe manual trans shifted well enough, with an easily modulated clutch. The tester was equipped with Jeep’s Command-Trac part-time 4WD mechanism. It can only be invoked when the road or trail is slippery. Lacking a center differential, it might be better for serious trail thumping than the more versatile Selec-Trac, which can be used as 2WD or AWD or 4WD as conditions dictate. Both gear-changers have a low range and they share a 2.72:1 torque-multiplication factor. This is useful for crawling ever so slowly over logs and rocks or for descending a steep slope without using the brakes.\n\nThe Command-Trac I had went into and came out of 4WD almost instantly with no fuss from below. Low range, accessed by tugging the transfer-case lever back another notch while stopped in neutral, was similarly well-bred. Jeep has been doing this stuff for a long time. Instruments, such as they are, are very legible. Black Gothic type plays off an ecru background. They are unfortunately just four in number – on a seriously-oriented machine such as this, one would like to see oil pressure and temperature gauges, a transmission temperature gauge and perhaps an inclinometer to advise when one is taking a slope a bit too sideways.\n\nWith the towing package, the Lib can tow up to 3,500 pounds with the six and manual transmission, 5,000 with the automatic, Jeep says.\n\nThis year all Libertys have four-wheel disc brakes, a worthy addition which makes for a firmer pedal feel. Discs also shed water better than drums, in case the exploratory works includes fording.\n\nThe Liberty fared well in th e government crash tests, garnering a top mark (five stars) for occupant protection in a side impact, and four stars for co-pilot, five for pilot protection in a frontal 30-mph collision. When the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety upped the ante, crashing the Liberty into an offset barrier at 40 mph (nearly twice the kinetic energy), Liberty was rated only marginal. One thing that caused it to be marked down: the dummy driver’s head went outside the vehicle when rebounding from the front air bag. The available side-curtain air bags for front and rear passenger compartments might be a good investment. Its bumpers landed it mid-pack in 5-mph bashings, running up a disgraceful repair bill of more than $6,000 in four incidents.\n\nThe tester was graced with some extras: A trailer tow group, $245; antilock for the 4-wheel disc brakes, $600; an overhead console with trip computer and universal garage door opener, $400; a traction-lock rear differential, $285; power heated mirrors with auto dimming for the driver’s outside reflector and the rearview, $200; moonroof, $700, and 6-way power driver’s seat, $300. With freight and package discount, the total was $26,535, a relative bargain in this class of midsize SUV. Payments on that one would be $538, assuming 20 percent down, 48 tickets and 10 percent interest.",

      "expert_review": "When you’re driving around in an SUV, it’s a good bet that you’re not going to get the best mileage numbers. My test drive of the 2009 Jeep Liberty just happened to fall on Earth Day, which made me even more aware of its 15/21 mpg city/highway rating.\n\nWhile I was driving, I kept an eye on the Liberty’s trip computer and hoped for a surprising mileage outcome. It didn’t happen. The best fuel consumption average I achieved was 18.7 mpg on my wide, open country roads. Needless to say, I immediately called my waste management company and added recycling to my trash service. Next, I drove to the grocery store and purchased a variety of earth-friendly cleaning products. Ahhh, that’s better.\n\nWhile the Liberty isn’t as environmentally friendly as I’d like it to be, it did spur an urge to get outdoors and enjoy the environment. The Liberty has many Wrangler-inspired features, like four-wheel drive and large tires (17-inchers are standard and 18-inch wheels are available); you can take the Liberty from car pool to tide pools with confidence.\n\nThe Liberty is truck-like in its maneuverability, and it even seemed sluggish and had difficulty accelerating when I switched out of four-wheel drive. Its four-wheel drive didn’t perform nearly as well as I expected on the muddy river that’s normally my street.\n\nInside and out, I appreciated the rugged nature of the Liberty’s looks. However, the Liberty should have given me more features, more storage space and a better ride despite its somewhat modest price tag.\n\nExterior\n\nI love the clean, boxy, rugged look of the Liberty. From its big, round headlights to its chunky tires, the Liberty screams “Jeep.” Its abrupt exterior angles contribute to the Liberty’s no-nonsense appeal.\n\nSecond-row passengers, especially kids, will find it impossible to get in and out of the Liberty without rubbing up against the dirty exterior. I suggest purchasing the optional side steps – available in either of two packages, for $795 or $1,090 – to get around this messy problem. I’d love to see Jeep offer fully integrated rocker panels or running boards as an option; these features would help passengers get into the Liberty easily and cleanly. My 3-year-old had some major issues in this department (see video below).\n\nI had some problems with the Liberty’s windshield, too. It’s set at a more vertical angle than most cars’, which is cool-looking, but it seems to catch and trap raindrops and bugs (ewww!), noticeably reducing visibility even when the wipers are in full swing.\n\nThe rear hatch window pops open separately from the liftgate, and it also can be lowered with a button on the key fob. My dog and I both loved that! The Liberty didn’t have a power liftgate, which would have been helpful because the cargo door was heavy and difficult to close.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nThe Liberty is comfortable to sit in, albeit a little too rough and tumble for my taste once we started moving. I enjoyed the heated leather seats as well as the funky-looking carrying case for the owner’s manual. It could easily double as a casual clutch (the purse, not the pedal!).\n\nMy family was in awe of the optional Sky Slider canvas roof that completely reveals the heavens to both first- and second-row passengers (see video below). It’s leak-proof, and the soft fabric folds on itself as it opens. Feel the breeze! However, we all noticed a strong chemical odor that infiltrated the cabin whenever we opened or closed this panel. Not knowing what was causing this stench, I opted to keep the panel closed to avoid any kind of exposure.\n\nIn the second row, the Latch connectors were easy to spot and use, and there’s plenty of room back there for all child-safety seat types. The cupholders are in the back of the center console, which places drinks completely out of my kids’ reach. Fortunately, our booster seats have built-in cupholders, so we weren’t dependent on the Liberty for this convenience. I sometimes wonder what would happen if auto manufacturers let kids in on the design-and-development process. Youngsters tend to speak their minds freely, and I know my kids would have no problem telling designers where to put everything and what to add to make their rides more enjoyable.\n\nAlthough my test car came with leather seats, the Liberty is also available with Stain Repel cloth seats. This material is stain-, odor- and static-resistant. It’s intriguing. If it works, it could save many consumers from paying for optional leather seats (part of a $995 option package), which are easier to clean than regular cloth seats.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nOne thing I really missed in the Liberty was a backup camera; it comes with an optional parking assist system, which includes a sonar-based warning system with audio and visual alerts. For a smaller SUV, the Liberty is still tall. If one of my children were standing behind it, there’s no way I could see them because the rear window is too high off the ground.\n\nThe Liberty comes with four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, stability control and traction control. It also comes with front-impact and side curtain airbags for both rows, but there are no side-impact airbags for front passengers.\n\nThe Liberty received a Good rating in frontal-offset crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. However, it only scored a Marginal in side-impact testing and a Poor in the rear crash test. Yikes! While the Liberty appears to deliver a solid, tank-like ride, I’d say this little SUV needs to head back to boot camp for additional safety training!\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of room for all types of child-safety seats and baby gear.\n\nIn School: Kids will probably get dirty when they climb in, but there’s plenty of space in the backseat for them.\n\nTeens: This is a cool-looking car with plenty of fun features – Sky Slider – to play with.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nTwo seasons back, the Jeep division of DaimlerChrysler replaced the old Cherokee with a slightly larger sport utility vehicle called the Liberty. Built at a new plant in Toledo, Ohio, the Liberty was claimed to be the stiffest Jeep ever and the first with rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nThree Liberty trim levels are available: Sport, Limited Edition and Renegade. The Limited Edition and Renegade are powered by a V-6 engine, while the Sport comes standard with a four-cylinder; the V-6 is optional.\n\nSafety features are the big news for 2004, as the Liberty gains a tire-pressure monitor and a BeltAlert reminder. A new Enhanced Accident Response System automatically unlocks the doors and then illuminates the courtesy lights 5 seconds after the deployment of an airbag, and the fuel pump shuts off immediately. All models add a passenger-side dashboard-mounted grab handle. The Renegade gains Rock Rail Protection and black bodyside moldings.\n\nExterior\nPronounced trapezoidal wheel flares are integrated into the body, and a traditional seven-slot Jeep grille highlights the front. Making the vehicle lower in front and higher at the rear aimed to impart a sense of forward motion. Short front and rear overhangs allow 36-degree approach and 31.5-degree departure angles for effective off-roading.\n\nThe Liberty rides a 104.3-inch wheelbase, measures 174.4 inches long overall and stands just over 70 inches tall. The spare tire is mounted externally on an innovative swing-out tailgate that features “flipper” glass. The tires measure 16 inches in diameter. Available skid plates cover the fuel tank and transfer case, and an optional Trailer-Towing Package yields a 5,000-pound capacity.\n\nInterior\nThe Liberty seats five people. A 65/35-split rear seat can be folded down with one hand, and door panels consist of a series of arcs. Round-dialed instruments with black-on-beige graphics sit in a cluster. All models now have a CD player, and the Limited Edition gets air conditioning, cruise control, a cargo-area cover, and power windows and locks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine comes standard in the Sport model. A 210-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 that produces 235 pounds-feet of torque is standard in the Limited Edition and Renegade models and optional in the Sport. Each engine teams with a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission and with one of two four-wheel-drive systems: standard part-time Command-Trac or optional full-time Selec-Trac.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags are standard. Antilock brakes and side curtain-type airbags are offered as optional equipment.\n\nDriving Impressions\nJeep took a big leap forward by developing the Liberty, without losing the character and proficiency of its predecessor. The Liberty is solidly constructed, offers quick, precise steering with moderate effort and features a pleasant feel. The ride is lovely on smooth roads, and it doesn’t deteriorate much when the pavement gets rough.\n\nOffroad runs are utterly amazing. Gnarled gravel paths seem almost like a Sunday drive on a paved parkway, but undulations are more noticeable in the backseat.\n\nPerformance is more than adequate, but not exceptional, with the V-6 engine and automatic transmission. At low highway speeds, the Liberty exhibits occasionally awkward downshifting. Firm yet comfortable seats offer excellent support and ample headroom and legroom. In addition to emitting only modest engine noise, this SUV is nearly devoid of four-wheel-drive drone in Low range.",

      "expert_review": "At a time when price per gallon is as volatile as fuel itself, interest has returned to diesel technology, which turns our attention to the diesel version of Jeep’s compact sport utility vehicle, the quick-selling Liberty CRD (technically either the Jeep Liberty Sport or Limited 4×4 trim level with optional equipment). Diesel engines are about 20 percent more efficient than comparable gasoline types, so they burn less fuel. In this country, diesel engines have long come in heavy duty pickup trucks, and more recently in the Ford Excursion and Hummer H1 SUVs, but the only companies to sell diesel passenger cars in recent times have been Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.\n\nThe Jeep Liberty has changed little recently, so I’m concentrating on the diesel aspect in this report. I’m a diesel fan, in part because of a fascination with biodiesel — the alternative fuel on which I’m most bullish. Diesels have a bad reputation in the U.S., where they’re perceived as dirty, smelly, cacophonous and underpowered. People complain that diesel fuel is too hard to find, too messy to dispense and not substantially cheaper than gas. I got into the Jeep Liberty thinking all these notions were overstated and out of date.\n\nThanks to trucks, old-school engines and General Motors’ catastrophic attempt in the late 1970s and ’80s to convert gasoline engines into diesels, Americans generally are turned off by the very idea. What they don’t realize is that there are actually many very smooth, quiet, refined and potent diesel car engines in the world now.\n\nUnfortunately, the Jeep Liberty’s is not one of them. The turbocharged 2.8-liter inline-four-cylinder starts like the diesels of yore, with a raucous clatter that dies down only somewhat as the engine warms up. It’s not an engine so much as a gem tumbler. Now, I wouldn’t be so harsh if … if the Liberty weren’t. But seriously, if diesel engines are to stand a chance of making inroads in North America, people need to recognize that the Liberty CRD is hardly the best that technology has to offer. The reality is that many Americans have been exposed to modern executions of diesel power by sharing the road with Mercedes and Volkswagen diesel models. They just didn’t know it.\n\nSo what exactly is good about diesels? Torque is good, and diesels have plenty of it. Take a look at the ratings below for the Liberty’s diesel and gasoline engines.\n\n \n\nJeep Liberty Engines\n \tGasoline\tDiesel\nType\t3.7-liter V-6\t2.8-liter inline-4\nHorsepower\t210 @ 5,200 rpm\t160 @ 3,800 rpm\nTorque (lbs.-ft.)\t235 @ 4,000 rpm\t295 @ 1,800 rpm\nRedline\t6,000 rpm\t4,300 rpm\nEPA-Estimated Fuel Economy\n(city/highway, mpg)\t17*/22\t22/26\n*Four-speed automatic; six-speed manual is 18 mpg city\nManufacturer data\n\n \n\nClearly, the diesel has more torque than horsepower, and gobs more torque than even the larger-displacement V-6. This is not a bad thing for the stop-and-go nature of U.S. motoring. In practice, the Liberty CRD lurched off the line like a stallion. The automatic transmission has five gears, but I noticed when accelerating onto the interstate that the stallion went a bit lame.\n\nI drove the Jeep Liberty CRD on a private off-road course, where another benefit of diesel power was evident: the ability to climb over obstacles without breaking a sweat. I switched the rear transfer case to low gear, put the transmission in 1st and took my foot off the pedals. The Liberty CRD did the rest. It’s no Jeep Wrangler, but it is still a smart off-road choice. The four wheels needed no coaxing to climb moderate inclines, and it even descended the declines in a more controlled fashion than the gasoline version did. A diesel’s higher compression ratio gives it more engine braking.\n\nRoughly half of the vehicles sold in Europe are diesel, mainly because fuel is much more expensive there and concern about greenhouse gases is greater. Because diesels burn less fuel, they release less carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas. But aren’t diesels dirty? Yes, here in the U.S. they pollute more than gasoline, but greenhouse gas technically isn’t a pollutant. Car pollution, also called emissions, includes stuff like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, both of which are in high concentrations in diesel exhaust. Their contribution to smog is why diesel car sales are outlawed in California and a few restrictive Northeastern states.\n\nOverseas, low-sulfur fuel and additional onboard pollution controls make diesel cars dramatically cleaner. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is requiring the phase-in of this cleaner fuel starting in June 2006, after which any new, properly equipped diesel that burns it will meet stringent new standards.\n\nWhen the time came to return the Jeep Liberty, I went to the web to find a diesel filling station. I had to drive a little farther than I would for gas, but I rationalized it away. When I arrived, the diesel pump was out of order. Then I drove around looking for another one, beginning to feel the inconvenience I’d dismissed before. When I finally found one, sure enough, the pump handle was coated in the oily diesel fuel, which doesn’t evaporate like gasoline does. The concrete was coated, too. When the tank was full, I literally skated back to the front door and got in, tracking a film of diesel fuel and its accompanying odor with me and onto the driver’s seat, the steering wheel and floor mats.\n\nMy receipt told me that I’d bought 10.7 gallons at $2.90 per gallon. Unfortunately, at the time, a few weeks ago, regular gasoline was selling at the same station for $2.35 per gallon — about 23 percent less. That means that if I got the true 20 percent better fuel economy with the diesel, I still paid a little more than I would have for gas.\n\nHistorically, diesel fuel cost considerably less than gasoline. Then it crept up, overtaking gasoline prices in the fourth quarter of 2004. Ever since, it has been neck-and-neck, with diesel occasionally more expensive. In the past six months, higher diesel prices have dominated, thanks mainly to the Gulf region’s brutal hurricanes. To oversimplify, gasoline is basically further-refined diesel, which means high demand for one affects the other’s availability, and gasoline got the priority.\n\nFuel pricing is always complex and seldom follows rules. Diesel fuel is similar to home heating oil, so late autumn and early winter typically bring scarcity that raises diesel prices. Now that we’re almost through a warmer-than-average winter, one would expect diesel prices to come down. We’re still waiting. Now, as this review publishes, the price remains higher: an average $2.54 per gallon nationally, while regular gasoline is $2.37.\n\nThe more I learn about energy, the more it seems that it’s an industry in balance. Significantly cheaper fuel will never come. The most we can hope for are alternatives that are slightly more affordable or that have some other benefit, such as renewability, lower pollution and domestic sourcing. Biodiesel offers all of these and is compatible with petroleum diesel. If its availability increases, there’s no shortage of cars overseas that offer diesel engines, including some we’re accustomed to in the States, like the Liberty.\n\nSo with all the downsides of diesel and the Jeep Liberty CRD, why has the model sold so quickly? Because some people just like diesels. Their fuel economy is better, they have greater towing torque, and diesel engines tend to last twice as long as their gasoline counterparts. I also believe there’s a type of person who buys a diesel not in spite of but because of its roughness. They like waiting for a glow plug to warm up before starting the engine. They like the clatter. They like filling up at an exclusive pump and generally feeling like they have something unique. Nowhere is this rough and crude engine type going to succeed more than in the rough and crude genre of off-road vehicles. Given the Liberty’s market success, don’t be surprised to see more diesel SUVs in the future.\n\n \n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn 2002, the Jeep division of DaimlerChrysler replaced the old Cherokee with a slightly larger sport utility vehicle called the Liberty. Built at a new plant in Toledo, Ohio, the Liberty was touted as the stiffest Jeep ever, and the first with rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nFor 2005, Liberty models get a freshened exterior, including a new fascia, grille, fog lamps, fender flares and bodyside moldings. Interior modifications include relocated power-window switches and new instrument-cluster graphics and trim bezels. Jeep says the seats are more comfortable, too.\n\nFor the first time in the U.S. and Canadian markets, a diesel engine is available in the Liberty. Jeep promises class-leading torque and towing capability for the diesel, along with 25 percent greater fuel economy and reduced carbon-dioxide emissions. The diesel engine will be available in Sport and Limited models with four-wheel drive and will team with a five-speed-automatic transmission. Four-cylinder- or V-6-powered gasoline models are available.\n\nA newly restyled Renegade model flaunts a more rugged appearance. For 2005, a six-speed-manual transmission replaces the previous five-speed unit.\n\nLiberty 4×4 models are Trail Rated, which means they meet or exceed the minimum requirements established by the Nevada Automotive Test Center and Jeep Engineering. Trail Rated vehicles are designed to perform in five categories: traction, ground clearance, maneuverability, articulation and water fording.\n\nExterior\nDespite the freshening for 2005, the Liberty hasn’t changed dramatically in appearance. Pronounced trapezoidal wheel flares are integrated into the body, and a traditional seven-slot Jeep grille highlights the front. The vehicle was made lower in front and higher at the rear in an attempt to impart a sense of forward motion. Short front and rear overhangs allow 36-degree approach and 31.5-degree departure angles for effective offroad driving.\n\nLiberty SUVs have a coil-spring independent front suspension and a solid rear axle with coil springs. The spare tire is mounted externally on a swing-out tailgate that features flip-up glass. Tires are available in 16- and 17-inch diameters. Available skid plates cover the fuel tank and transfer case, and an optional Trailer Tow Package yields a 5,000-pound towing capacity.\n\nRenegades feature a new, flatter hood, a taller grille, offroad fog lamps and taillight guards. Functional rock rails and four skid plates are installed. All-terrain P235/70R16 tires and an overhead light bar are optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Liberty seats up to five people. A 65/35-split rear seat can be folded down with one hand. The instrument panel features round gauges. All models have a CD player, and Renegades may be fitted with a DVD-based GPS navigation radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder is standard in the Sport model. A 210-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 that produces 235 pounds-feet of torque is standard in the Limited Edition and Renegade models and optional in the Sport. A six-speed-manual or four-speed-automatic transmission is available, as is rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\n\nThe new 2.8-liter four-cylinder common-rail diesel engine produces 160 hp at 3,800 rpm and 295 pounds-feet of torque at 1,800 rpm. It mates with a five-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags are standard. Antilock brakes and side curtain-type airbags are offered as optional equipment.",

      "expert_review": "At some point, most people I know have wanted a Jeep. These people usually mean a Wrangler when picturing their dream Jeep, but many parents have asked me whether the Liberty is a better option for their teen driver. The short answer is no.\n\nAn off-road SUV, the 2012 Jeep Liberty is best left to experienced drivers who can handle its rough suspension and unforgiving manner; its less-than stellar crash-test ratings should give parents pause, too.\n\nThe Liberty’s rough ride wore on me during my weeklong test drive. Yes, it’s an off-roading SUV so a bouncy ride is to be expected, but it was so jarring that I found it exhausting. Its tiny turning radius had me questioning whether the Liberty came with power steering.\n\nThe standard V-6 engine has decent pickup at lower speeds, but it had to work a bit at higher speeds. Add to that the EPA-estimated 15/21 mpg city/highway and my wanderlust started to wander off.\n\nThe 2012 Jeep Liberty has a starting price of $24,320, including a $925 destination charge. My test car, a Liberty Sport base with four-wheel drive, rang up at $27,110.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Liberty has a boxy look that screams it’s a Jeep from afar. It’s longer than its Wrangler sibling, offering a traditional SUV shape with an adequate cargo area.\n\nAs expected, the Liberty has a high step-in height. Little ones will need help not just getting in, but with the push-button door handles, too, though adults should have no problems. Despite that, they most likely will love riding up high and bouncing all over the place (even when strapped into their child-safety seats).\n\nThe Liberty’s cargo floor is so high that it was the same height as a grocery cart handle. That high lift floor didn’t bother me during my weeklong test drive, but it might get old over time.\n\nThe Liberty has a standard 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine with a four-speed automatic transmission. It uses regular gas. My test car also had hill start assist. The Liberty has a choice of two optional four-wheel-drive systems: Command-Trac II, a part-time system, and the full-time Selec-Trac system. When properly equipped with the trailer package ($545), the Liberty can tow up to 5,000 pounds.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some-Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Liberty’s interior is hyper-utilitarian. My test SUV’s interior was dark gray, and all the surfaces were a hard plastic. No soft-touch here.\n\nThe cloth seats were incredibly comfortable, and I enjoyed my elevated view of the road from the driver’s seat. All the instruments and buttons were clearly marked and easy to use. I appreciate utilitarian elements; I don’t like to get bogged down in complicated systems. For this, the Liberty made me happy.\n\nAs far as storage goes, there’s a shallow glove box, a deep center console and bins in the doors. The front cupholders are large, and there’s a small tray next to them to hold something, though I’m not sure what. The backseat’s cupholders are just shallow wells that are at the rear of the front row’s center console. This location can be hard to reach, especially for kids in child-safety seats.\n\nPassenger legroom in the Liberty is strange. In the front, the passenger side has a hump coming from the gearshift that intrudes into the footwell. In the rear, the legroom isn’t deep from front to back. I was surprised by how much I had to move the front passenger seat forward to get an infant seat to fit.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Liberty has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. The anchors sit in the open and are easy to use. Fitting a rear-facing infant-safety seat into the Liberty wasn’t easy. I had to move the front passenger seat forward significantly to create enough room for the car seat. A booster seat fit well in this SUV, but the seat belt buckles are floppy, which can be tricky to grasp for smaller hands.\n\nSome of the 2012 Liberty’s crash-test ratings are less than desirable. In tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Liberty received the highest score of Good in front and roof-strength crash tests, the second-highest score of Acceptable in the rear crash test and the second-lowest score of Marginal in the side-impact test. In crash-tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2012 Liberty scored three stars of five overall. It also earned three stars in the rollover crash test, four stars in the side-impact crash test and two stars in the frontal test.\n\nThe Liberty has standard rear-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with anti-roll control and traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Four-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Jeep Liberty here.",

Liberty competitors include the Nissan Xterra and Suzuki Grand Vitara.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nFor 2011, besides the new Renegade trim level, there are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\n\n\nThe Liberty features Jeep’s traditional seven-slot grille and trapezoidal fender flares that enhance the vehicle’s side profile. Unlike many panoramic sunroofs offered today, Jeep’s Sky Slider roof is made of canvas rather than glass. The fabric roof folds on itself as it opens, and Jeep says the top is leak-proof. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard automatic headlamps\nStandard body-colored grille, front and rear bumpers, and moldings\nStandard remote keyless entry\nOptional express-up windows\nStandard power-operated and heated side mirrors that can fold\n16-, 17- or 18-inch wheels\nOptional roof rails\nOptional full-open canvas roof system\nOptional chrome grille\n\n \n\nInterior\n\nThe Liberty’s interior features a large floor console with cupholders, armrest and a storage area with a removable top tray.\n\nBoth the left and right rear panels in the cargo area have tie-down loops for securing items to the load floor. The left rear panel houses a concealed compartment for jack storage and tools. Interior features include:\n\nStandard power locks, windows and mirrors\nStandard floormats\nStain-resistant cloth or leather upholstery available\nOptional heated, powered front seats\nOptional leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nOptional hands-free communication system\nOptional navigation system\n\n \n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Liberty has a standard fuel shut-off system that turns off fuel when the vehicle is decelerating. There’s also a standard fuel-saving indicator that lights up in the odometer to notify the driver when the vehicle is being driven in a fuel-efficient manner.\n\nAll models come with a four-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Liberty can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 with 235 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic transmission\nTrailer tow package that includes a full-size spare, Class III trailer hitch and trailer-sway control\nRear- or four-wheel drive\n\n \n\nSafety\n\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard all-disc antilock braking system\nStandard electronic stability control with electronic roll mitigation and all-speed traction control\nStandard smart key that immobilizes the engine in a theft attempt\nOptional parking assist system includes a sonar-based warning system with audible and visual alerts",
