      "expert_review": "The Grand Cherokee 4xe and Wrangler 4xe were the first Jeep models to usher in the brand’s electrified future, but the plug-in hybrids now are going back in time with a pair of retro-inspired variants debuting at the 2022 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The 2023 Grand Cherokee 4xe 30th Anniversary will be available for a limited time with unique exterior appointments and more standard safety features, while the 2023 Wrangler Willys 4xe becomes the new base model for the off-road-oriented hybrid, bringing a lower price of admission.\n\nRelated: More Detroit Auto Show Coverage\n\nGrand Cherokee 4xe 30th Anniversary\n\nTo commemorate the Grand Cherokee’s three decades of history, the Grand Cherokee 4xe 30th Anniversary comes with blackened exterior accents and a unique front end. It also gets blue tow hooks, new 20-inch black wheels, 30th Anniversary badging and a body-colored rear, lower moldings and wheel flares. Inside, the special edition gets black leather seats, ventilated front seats, and additional tech and safety features including front and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking, a digital rearview mirror and a 360-degree camera system. A standard 10.1-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, built-in navigation and a nine-speaker Alpine audio system are also included.\n\nThe SUV’s hybrid powertrain carries over from the 2022 model and combines a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, two electric motors and a 400-volt, 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack for a total of 375 horsepower and 470 pounds-feet of torque. It gets an EPA-rated 56 mpg-equivalent and 25 miles of all-electric range, and it can tow up to 6,000 pounds.\n\nWrangler Willys 4xe\n\nWhile the Grand Cherokee 4xe marks the model’s big 3-0, the 2023 Wrangler Willys 4xe throws it back further to its namesake’s roots in the 1940s. The Willys 4xe falls below the Sahara 4xe as the most affordable plug-in Wrangler; it can be identified with a Willys decal on the hood and “Electric 4-Wheel Drive” decal on the swing gate. Other standard features include LED headlights and foglights, an Alpine nine-speaker audio system, all-weather floormats, a rear limited-slip differential, rock rails, a black grille and 17-inch black-painted alloy wheels.\n\nThe current Wrangler 4xe’s base Sahara trim comes standard with the latest Uconnect 4C multimedia system featuring built-in navigation and an 8.4-inch touchscreen; these features will be optional on the new Willys 4xe. The base model will likely share the gas-powered Wrangler Willys’ 7-inch touchscreen and Uconnect 4 with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe Willys 4xe gets the standard hybrid setup, a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine, two electric motors and a 400-volt battery pack for a system total of 375 hp and 470 pounds feet of torque. It gets an EPA-rated 49 mpg-e and 21 miles of all-electric range. The Wrangler 4xe offers three modes as part of its standard E Selec system: Hybrid, Electric and eSave. The latter saves battery charge for later use or employs the gas engine to recharge the battery.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n2023 Jeep Wrangler Willys 4xe | Manufacturer image\n\nThe 2023 Grand Cherokee 4xe 30th Anniversary will add $4,700 to the 2023 Grand Cherokee 4xe’s price tag, which has not yet been announced. According to Jeep, orders will open later in 2022, and the model will arrive by early 2023. Currently, the 2022 Grand Cherokee 4xe’s base model starts at $57,660 (all prices include destination).\n\nJeep is now taking orders for the 2023 Wrangler Willys 4xe, which is expected to arrive late in 2022 with a starting price of $55,590. Previously, the Sahara 4xe was the most affordable variant with a $56,360 starting price, followed by the Rubicon at $60,190 and the range-topping High Altitude at $62,135.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV Priced to Start Around $60K\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Goes High-Tech, Gets Hybrid\nA Whisper in the Woods: Jeep Details the 2021 Wrangler 4xe Plug-In Hybrid\nJeep Wrangler Unlimited 4xe Is Now Even More Expensive\n2021 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited 4xe Electric Range Test: Is It Better Naked?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed 2024 Jeep Wrangler features several subtle but significant upgrades that bring more capabilities and improve safety without upsetting the fundamental Wrangler experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Wrangler’s primary competitor, the Ford Bronco, has been making sales inroads of late, but the Jeep’s enhancements for 2024 should help keep it fully competitive with its main rival.\n\nThe current-generation Jeep Wrangler debuted for the 2018 model year, bringing a higher level of sophistication and refinement to a time-honored off-road icon. Jeep actively expanded the Wrangler’s roster over the last five years, adding the EcoDiesel V-6 engine for 2020 and the 4xe plug-in hybrid and outrageous 470-horsepower Rubicon 392 for 2021. The Wrangler has long enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the serious off-roader market, but that changed when Ford launched its long-awaited revival of its storied Bronco for 2021, taking direct aim at the Wrangler.\n\nRelated: 2024 Jeep Wrangler: Tech Overhaul, Capability Gains, New Base 4xe\n\nThe Wrangler was already due for a refresh, and the challenge of a fresh rival with some nostalgic heritage of its own surely lit an extra fire under Jeep’s engineers and product planners. So, for 2024, the Wrangler lineup receives a number of welcome upgrades and new features, chief among them a new infotainment system and a couple of key safety items. I drove a handful of 2024 Wranglers and sampled several of these enhancements at the brand’s press preview event in St. George, Utah. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nPowertrains Stand Pat\n\nThe Wrangler’s powertrain lineup and basic trim-level hierarchy carries over for the most part. The 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 engine was phased out during the 2023 model year, but the 285-hp, 3.6-liter gas V-6 remains standard in most trims, with the 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder optional. Power-hungry types (with a lot of disposable income) can still choose the Rubicon 392 and its 470-hp, 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. The 4xe PHEV gains a new entry-level Sport S trim with a starting price of $51,790 (all prices include destination), shaving almost $5,000 off the PHEV’s price of entry. There’s also a new Rubicon X variant that comes standard with 35-inch tires, an integrated off-road camera and a steel front bumper.\n\nI drove a few 4xes at the event; one of them had a full battery charge and delivered 22 miles of pure-electric driving range, meeting its 2023 EPA estimate. The 4xe’s electric-motor whir in all-electric driving is accompanied by a rather coarse exhaust note when the four-cylinder engine kicks in. I also took a Rubicon 392 on a challenging off-road trail, where its hairy-chested V-8 rumble delighted even if it was ridiculously overpowered for the driving tasks at hand. When you’re driving a Rubicon 392, some people (and probably you) won’t be able to resist the urge to grunt like Tim Allen when goosing the throttle pedal.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nInfotainment Improvements\n\nOne of the most noteworthy updates is apparent the minute you get inside a 2024 Wrangler: A 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen running Jeep’s latest Uconnect 5 software replaces the 7- or 8.4-inch screens of the outgoing model. Jeep says the Uconnect 5 operating system is five times more powerful than Uconnect 4, and it’s upgradable via over-the-air updates. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is standard, and new features include the ability to program up to five driver profiles with customized presets for music, apps, seating position and climate controls.\n\nOn Wranglers equipped with navigation, the infotainment system gets the Trails Offroad trail guide feature — complete with maps and details like difficulty level, terrain types, camping amenities and availability of electric vehicle charging stations. The feature comes preloaded with about 200 trail guides, including 62 Jeep Badge of Honor trails, and offers a $39.99 annual subscription that unlocks more than 3,000 trail maps. We only got a brief demo of the system, but it looks like a genuine value add for die-hard off-road adventurers.\n\nThe new touchscreen is nicely integrated into the Wrangler’s signature flat-panel dashboard above its central physical controls. The larger display screen is a big plus in general, but especially when using the available front off-road camera. And thankfully, bright sunlight doesn’t affect the visibility of the display; you can still read the screen when you have your Wrangler’s top and doors off. The system’s response times are quick, and almost all features are easy to access via shortcuts and a menu bar that runs down the left side of the screen.\n\nInterior Improvements\n\nPrevious Wranglers all made do with manual front seats, but High Altitude and above trim levels now come with 12-way power-adjustable front seats; Jeep says the seats have been designed and tested to withstand the Wrangler’s maximum water-fording capability of 34 inches. These trims also get acoustic front glass, thicker carpet and sound-deadening foam for a 5-decibel reduction in ambient noise inside the cabin, though the Wrangler is still one of the noisier vehicles on the market due to its boxy shape, removable top and, typically, off-road-focused tires.\n\nDash-top accessory mounting points are a subtle but clever update. They’re located under rubberized liners on two depressed areas atop the dashboard and can be used for aftermarket mounts for a smartphone, GoPro camera or what have you.\n\nOn the safety front, first- and second-row side curtain airbags are a new standard feature along with structural improvements for side impact performance. Along the same lines, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability go in Sport S and higher trims. A blind spot monitor with rear cross-path detection and rear parking sensors go in High Altitude and above trims and are available on other trims.\n\nExterior Updates\n\nIn addition to primarily cosmetic updates like the redesigned grille (with unique finishes on Willys, High Altitude and Sahara trims) and 10 new wheel designs across the lineup, there’s a welcome functional update: Instead of the old wire antenna mounted on the passenger-side front fender, the antenna is now integrated into the windshield. This is an especially nice feature for off-road driving — one less thing to snag on a tree branch or other obstacle along the trail.\n\nThe new grille retains the iconic Jeep seven-slot design, but it’s a bit shorter than before and has additional open areas between the slots for extra cooling; Jeep says these changes are to accommodate the factory-installed Warn winch that is newly available on the Rubicon. The winch has an 8,000-pound capacity (we watched it hoist a dune buggy out of a ravine during a demonstration at the press event). It costs $1,995 on Rubicon X and Rubicon 392 trims and $3,495 as part of an option package on regular Rubicons that also includes steel bumpers; not cheap, but there is the extra piece of mind that comes with a fully validated factory installation of a popular aftermarket item.\n\nOther Upgrades\n\nRubicons also get a more capable rear axle — a full-float Dana 44 HD unit that enables tire upsizing by customers and increases maximum towing capacity from 3,500 pounds to 5,000 pounds. Jeep had a Rubicon hooked up to a 4,300-pound Airstream trailer for us to tow on the press event, and it did so without breaking a sweat.\n\nAll 4xe variants will offer a Power Box adapter that plugs into the external charging port, enabling external devices to run off the vehicle’s battery. The Power Box includes four household outlets and supports 30 amps of total output; it comes standard on Sahara, Rubicon, Rubicon X and High Altitude 4xe variants; Sport S and Willys 4xe trims will offer the Power Box as an option later in the model year. The Power Box strikes us as a handy accessory for camping or tailgating — Jeep representatives were using one to power a widescreen TV at the press event, and the cable is long enough to position the box several feet away from the vehicle.\n\nAll of these upgrades and new features don’t change the fundamental personality or driving characteristics of the Wrangler, they just make it a little bit more capable and up to date … and a little more competitive against those pesky Broncos.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRefreshed 2024 Jeep Wrangler Starts at $33,690\n2024 Jeep Wrangler Up Close: Beefier, Safer, More Capable\n2024 Jeep Wrangler Vs. 2023 Ford Bronco Specs Comparison\nResearch the 2024 Jeep Wrangler\nShop for a 2024 Jeep Wrangler\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is Jeep’s long-serving 4×4, available as a two- or four-door SUV (the latter of which was formerly known as the Wrangler Unlimited). The two-door model has room for four people, while the four-door version seats five. A standard 285-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine works with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. Other available engines include a 270-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. There’s also the Wrangler 4xe, which comes only as a four-door and has a plug-in hybrid four-cylinder powertrain that makes 375 hp and provides an electric-only driving range of up to 22 miles, according to the EPA. Four-wheel drive is standard, and the Rubicon trim level features upgraded mechanicals for more intense off-roading. Wrangler competitors include the Ford Bronco, Toyota 4Runner and Land Rover Defender. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the four-door Wrangler has 18.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nPower locks and windows are finally standard for 2025. (The Wrangler’s removable doors necessitate a quick-release wiring connector for in-door electrical components, which makes Jeep’s omission of these otherwise almost universal accessories until now understandable.) A new available Active Cabin Ventilation feature allows customers to air out their Wranglers remotely via the Jeep app. Also new for 2025 is a Wrangler 4xe Willys ’41 Special Edition, which honors the model’s World War II roots with military-inspired paint, interior and wheels. The V-8-powered Rubicon 392 is no more, but Jeep says its brawny 6.4-liter V-8 engine will get one more year of life in the fully loaded 392 Final Edition trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Wrangler Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPower locks and windows \nFolding soft top\nPush-button start\nCloth seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCruise control\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nLED headlights\nThree-piece hard top\nHard top with power-retractable roof panel\nRemote start\nAutomatic climate control\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nAlpine premium stereo\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Wrangler?\n\nThe Wrangler is a back-to-basics SUV, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheaply. The base two-door model starts at almost $34,000 and the more practical four-door Wrangler is even pricier, but both lack basic modern tech, including forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. What you get for your money, though, is a rugged 4×4 that’s fun to drive, has an iconic look and is extremely capable off-road.",
