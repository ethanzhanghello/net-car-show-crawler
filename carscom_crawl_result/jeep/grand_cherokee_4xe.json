      "expert_review": "Verdict: The Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe is a pricier but more powerful alternative to a gasoline-only Grand Cherokee, and going all-electric off-road is pleasant. On-road, however, I longed for a V-8 Grand Cherokee.\n\nVersus the competition: More refined than the Wrangler 4xe, the Grand Cherokee 4xe lacks any other off-road-oriented hybrid competition, and while it holds its own against gas-only competition like the Land Rover Defender, it doesn’t outshine it.\n\nFollowing a successful launch of the four-door Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep’s march toward electrification continues by placing that 4xe plug-in hybrid powertrain into the iconic, redesigned-for-2022 Grand Cherokee. As does the Wrangler 4xe, the Grand Cherokee 4xe produces a combined 375 horsepower and 470 pounds-feet of torque via a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, two electric motors and a 17.3-kilowatt-hour battery.\n\nRelated: 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review: Grander Across the Board\n\nThe 4xe is available in base, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve trims. We drove a 4xe Trailhawk around Chicago and on an off-road course to see how it compared to the gas-only, V-8-powered Grand Cherokee Summit we tested earlier this year.\n\nPleasing and Frustrating to Drive\n\nGiven the biggest change to the Grand Cherokee 4xe is under the hood, let’s start with the driving experience. On pavement, the off-road-oriented 4xe Trailhawk had some pluses and some minuses. The SUV is surprisingly quick when the electric motors and gas engine are working together. Instant torque from the electric motors helps the 4xe get off the line quickly, and at highway speeds, the four-cylinder provides enough oomph for passing and merging. The plug-in-hybrid Grand Cherokee is probably not as quick as the last-generation SRT trim, and it’s certainly not as quick as the bonkers Trackhawk, but it felt faster than the V-8 Summit, even with the Trailhawk’s knobby off-road tires.\n\nThe sound of the hybrid drivetrain, however, is much, much worse than the V-8. Where the V-8 produces a sonorous rumble from its exhaust, the 4xe’s dominant sound is an angry buzzing from under the hood that only gets worse during hard acceleration. It’s not the worst sound in the world, but it doesn’t fit the vehicle or its performance.\n\nThe driving experience on pavement is otherwise almost identical to a gas-powered Grand Cherokee: comfortable and composed. The Trailhawk’s tires have larger sidewalls than those on the conventional Summit I drove, improving isolation over bumps. The air suspension shared by both SUVs does a good job reducing body roll, but it has a stiffness that makes bumps seem harsher. The 4xe’s brakes feel a bit mushier and less linear than those in its gasoline counterpart, likely because of the PHEV’s regenerative braking. I wish it had true one-pedal driving instead of just an extremely aggressive regen braking setting, but one-pedal driving is more common in full EVs than in PHEVs, where it remains rare.\n\nOff-road, the Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk is quite capable, making short work of a relatively easy off-road course. That said, acceleration can be difficult to modulate when using full hybrid power — that is, when the gas engine and electric motors are working together. There are, however,  three 4xe-specific drive modes to the left of the steering wheel: Hybrid, which employs the gas engine and electric motors; Electric, which lets the 4xe operate under pure electric power; and eSave, which lets the 4xe operate solely under gas power to save the battery’s charge for later use. Switching from Hybrid to Electric mode reduces available power but makes the 4xe much less twitchy, which is useful on difficult terrain (and also eliminates the four-cylinder’s annoying noise). I had a harder time modulating the throttle using full Hybrid power while off-roading, where smooth and steady is usually the ideal.\n\nThe Trailhawk’s standard Quadra-Drive II 4WD system is the most advanced of three 4WD systems available on the Grand Cherokee. It has a two-speed transfer case and rear electronic limited-slip differential, and it features a variety of terrain-specific driving modes.\n\nOne of the chief reasons to buy a plug-in hybrid is to save gas; if your daily driving route is short enough, and you have home charging, you might need the gas engine only for longer trips. The Grand Cherokee 4xe has an EPA-estimated all-electric range of 26 miles, which isn’t the longest among new PHEV SUVs, but it’s not the shortest, either. In my experience, though, electric range dropped quickly.\n\nThe EPA rates the Grand Cherokee 4xe at 56 mpg-equivalent using both gas and electric motors, 23 mpg combined when relying solely on its internal combustion engine. That 23 mpg  is the highest combined fuel economy rating of any new Grand Cherokee, which is notable because the Wrangler 4xe’s hybrid-only rating offers no advantage over the Wrangler’s non-hybrid engines.\n\nMostly the Same Interior, For Better and Worse\n\nNot a lot differentiates the 4xe’s interior from the conventional Grand Cherokee, but it does have unique charging-status indicator lights atop the dashboard, three PHEV-specific drive mode buttons to the left of the steering wheel, a button for controlling regenerative braking force and some PHEV-specific screens in the touchscreen display. Beyond those, the differences are only cosmetic, with light blue accents on various buttons and surfaces (because light blue is apparently the official color of hybrids everywhere).\n\nThe 4xe enters the market at a fairly strong position because it’s not very different from the gas-powered Grand Cherokee. Its control layout is intuitive, and its materials have a price-appropriate upscale feeling. The 10.1-inch touchscreen display running Uconnect 5 is clear and easy to use — provided it isn’t glitching or lagging, which are issues that carry over from the 4xe’s non-hybrid counterpart.\n\nOther advantages include comfortable front and rear seating, plus high-tech goodies like a 10.25-inch touchscreen for the front passenger (it’s not visible to the driver) that can control in-car entertainment, navigation, and available dual screens for backseat passengers with built-in Amazon Fire TV.\n\nBesides tech issues with the main touchscreen, my biggest complaint regarding the interior transcends Grand Cherokee generations: From my driving position, visibility is hindered by the A-pillars and rearview mirror. This could just be a “me” issue, though, so be sure to sit in a Grand Cherokee before you buy to make sure it isn’t a problem for you.\n\nSafety\n\nGrand Cherokee 4xe buyers get a host of standard safety features, as do buyers of the gas-only version. These include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian and cyclist detection; adaptive cruise control; a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert; and much more.\n\nAs of this writing, the Grand Cherokee 4xe has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nWhich Electric Cars Are Still Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit?\nWhich Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Are Most Available?\nUp Close With the 2023 Jeep Wagoneer L and Grand Wagoneer L\nWhat Is the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure\n\nIs the Grand Cherokee 4xe the right SUV for you? Is it even the right Grand Cherokee for you? One of the nice things about the 4xe is how much it mimics the gas version, but with improved fuel economy. According to EPA fuel-cost estimations, buyers save $2,100 per year driving a 4xe instead of a V-8 Grand Cherokee. The 4xe also adds quickness, but its four-cylinder makes a racket, and the hybrid is pricier than its gas-only counterparts (at least, before tax credits are factored in). The cheapest 4xe is priced from $63,495, and our test 4xe Trailhawk was $64,280 before adding $7,510 in options (prices have risen since our test drive, with the 2022 an 4xe Trailhawk now starting at $67,055). The cheapest 2022 Grand Cherokee that can have a V-8 is also the Trailhawk, where that engine is a $3,795 option that brings the total price to $59,825. It’s definitely cheaper, but saving $2,100 a year in fuel costs would cover the difference in just over two years.\n\nCould I live with a Grand Cherokee 4xe? Yes, especially considering the money-saving potential over the long term. But because the 4xe is so similar to the gas-only Grand Cherokee, but sounds worse, I’d opt for a V-8 Grand Cherokee if all else were equal. In the current car market, however, things aren’t always equal. For 2023, the only Grand Cherokee Trailhawk will be the 4xe version, so if you want the most hardcore off-road Grand Cherokee, it’ll have to be a plug-in.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV with five seats in two rows. It’s powered by a 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 or a 375-hp 4xe plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and two electric motors. The PHEV uses a 17.3-kilowatt-hour battery and has an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 26 miles. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Models fitted with the V-6 can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, while the plug-in hybrid comes solely with 4WD.\n\nThe extensive tech and comfort features offered in the Grand Cherokee are impressive, especially in high-end trims like the Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve. True to Jeep tradition, the Grand Cherokee excels at all-terrain adventuring when equipped with options like an adaptive air suspension, off-road camera system, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Rivals include the Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is unchanged for 2025, but Jeep has lowered starting prices across the model lineup.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Alpine audio system\n19-speaker McIntosh audio system\nPanoramic moonroof\nAdaptive air suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDepending on the trim, the Grand Cherokee can be a nicely appointed family runabout or a luxury SUV loaded with features like leather seats, real wood trim and a premium audio system. Keep in mind, though, that the price of the Grand Cherokee just about doubles once you scale the highest reaches of Summit and Summit Reserve trims fitted with the optional PHEV powertrain. If you’re considering a Grand Cherokee but need additional passenger room, the larger Grand Cherokee L has three rows of seats.",

      "expert_review": "Earlier this year, the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee won our Best SUV of 2023 award, chosen from its large field of peers for its versatility, wide range of prices and features, luxurious cabins, state-of-the-art technology and legitimate go-anywhere chops. But we began to wonder … just how go-anywhere are those go-anywhere chops? Given the model we purchased for a yearlong test was the off-road-focused 4xe Trailhawk plug-in hybrid, it seemed natural to take the thing into the dirt for some proper off-roading.\n\nRelated: Why Did We Buy a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe?\n\nAnd I’m not talking just a dirt path to a campsite or a gravel driveway at the country club. I mean throwing it into a Jeep Jamboree, the kind of off-road enthusiast gathering that would test the thing to its limits, plastic bumpers and rocker panels be damned. So that’s exactly what we did — we took it to a Jeep Jamboree at the Badlands Off Road Park in Attica, Ind., where it joined around a hundred other Jeeps on the trails, quarries, cliffs, sand traps and streams of rural America. How did Jeep’s top off-road Grand Cherokee do in the rough?\n\nWhat’s the Trailhawk Bring to the Party?\n\nThere’s half a dozen different trim levels of the Grand Cherokee, ranging from the more affordable lower-end Laredo up through the super-luxurious Summit Reserve, and half a dozen again of the 4xe plug-in hybrid variant. The “4xe” is Jeep-speak for the PHEV version, which replaces the standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine in the Grand Cherokee with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine combined with an electric drive motor and a 17.3-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. The system works with an eight-speed automatic transmission and in the Trailhawk sends power to the wheels through Jeep’s Quadra-Drive II 4×4 system with a two-speed transfer case and 2.72:1 low range, enabling a 47.4:1 crawl ratio.\n\nYou also get Selec-Terrain traction management, allowing you to select a mode that matches the Jeep’s environment (Rock, Mud/Sand, Snow, etc.) that then controls the off-road systems. The Trailhawk has 10.9 inches of maximum ground clearance, 18-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrain tires, and special glare-resistant matte-black-and-blue hood decals. A driver-adjustable, variable-height air suspension comes with it, too. Add in some underbody reinforcements and protection for the watertight battery pack, and you’re ready to hit the trails — which we most eagerly did.\n\nGetting to the Wilderness\n\nThe idea of buying a Grand Cherokee trim that’s capable of serious off-roading is ostensibly that you like going off-road but need something comfortable, quiet and cushy for your everyday use — otherwise, you’d likely be buying a Wrangler. But if you spend more time on-road than off, Wranglers come with compromises: They’re loud, handle poorly, wander all over the highway in a crosswind and aren’t known for their occupant comfort. Grand Cherokees, however, are known for comfort. Even this Trailhawk model, with its knobby all-terrain tires, is wonderful to drive on the street. It tracks true down the highway at speed, navigates city streets with ease and absorbs potholes with aplomb. It’s just so comfortable in nearly every aspect. There’s plenty of sound insulation to keep the cabin mostly hushed, with only the drone of the all-terrain tires coming through to disturb the cabin Zen.\n\nThe 4xe PHEV system is quite good, as well, especially when you leave it in Electric mode. That’s when the truly hushed operation shines through, and there’s still enough power to get you through traffic smartly or cruise along at highway speeds. The Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk has 26 miles of all-electric range, according to EPA estimates, but you may be able to eke out more miles if you’re a cautious driver, and you’ll certainly come in under that range if you’re barreling down the highway in Electric mode. There’s also a Hybrid mode that lets the Jeep decide how to best mix the gas and electric systems, plus an eSave mode that will either maintain the battery’s current charge or run the engine continuously to recharge the battery.\n\nOut in the Wild\n\nBadlands Off Road Park is a great place to run through all kinds of terrain to see how the Jeep handles itself. The site of an old quarry, it features all types of off-road conditions: deep woodland trails, loose deep sand and gravel, tall rock formations for climbing, and streams for fording. It’s a mishmash of just about everything you could want. We started each day with a full charge and vowed to keep the Trailhawk in Electric mode as much as possible until the batteries ran out and we needed to use the gas engine.\n\nIn this mode, we were able to get about 9-10 miles of low-speed rock and trail crawling out of the fully charged battery before needing the four-cylinder gas engine. That’s well below the EPA-estimated electric range, but this was not typical use — in most cases, we were in an off-road mode (either Rock or Mud/Sand, depending on conditions) with low range engaged on the transfer case. This enables a lot of torque to be had at the wheels but not a lot of speed to be carried, which is what you want for rock crawling and trail riding.\n\nTo prepare for our off-road adventure, we aired down the Grand Cherokee’s tires to 25 pounds per square inch for better grip on loose and slippery surfaces. Going too much below that would risk pulling a tire off a rim in rocky terrain (not something we wanted to do), but leaving the tires at their recommended pressures is also not the best for off-roading on soft terrain. We also put the Grand Cherokee’s air suspension in the Off-Road 2 mode, bringing it to its full height for 10.9 inches of ground clearance and better scaling up and over obstacles. You need that extra height to improve the Grand Cherokee’s approach angle, but even this wasn’t enough to save the SUV’s fixed lower front bumper from some trail damage during the event. Finally, we slapped the required trail flag onto the side, put it in Electric mode and went into the park.\n\n(Mostly) Silent Wheeling Is Awesome\n\nFor 2023, the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk is only available with the 4xe powertrain. This is, frankly, a brilliant move. The off-road community has been slow to warm up to the idea of a plug-in hybrid off-road machine (out of some 100 Wranglers at the Jeep Jamboree we attended, only one was a customer-owned 4xe), but with more Wranglers being sold with the powertrain every day, that seems likely to change soon. Putting that powertrain in the most capable off-road Grand Cherokee seems like even more of a no-brainer since it matches up well with the personality of the Grand Cherokee.\n\n2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk | Cars.com photo by Corey Watts\n\nAnd the 4xe powertrain proved to be outstanding out in the rough. There’s nothing like the sensation of rolling in near silence through the woods with the windows down, the only noises coming from the crunch of the tires on pebbles and the chirping of birds. The way the electric powertrain operates when scaling obstacles or descending steep, loose grades is also amazing — there’s so much available torque, and all of it is easily controlled and arrives in dead silence. The 4xe powertrain is so good at going off-road, I may not want to go wheeling in anything other than an electrified vehicle going forward.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\ncom Best SUV of 2023: the 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee\nOwnership Update: What Do We Think of Our 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk So Far?\n2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Review: Nearly Silent Off-Roading Is Nice\nIs the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nShop for a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe\nCapable, But It Could Be More So\n\nThe Trailhawk proved to be extremely capable out in the rough, but it’s not perfect. It only has an electronic limited-slip differential in the rear, not a selectably lockable diff, so you’re relying on the traction control to detect slippage and automatically transfer torque from the wheel that slips to the wheel that grips … which didn’t always reliably occur. One obstacle in particular stymied the Grand Cherokee: When trying to scale a wet and slippery rock face up into a tunnel, the Trailhawk got its front up and over the rocks but couldn’t get traction to get its back end up — no matter how many times we tried to “bump” it over or what setting we put it in. A manually lockable rear differential would’ve almost certainly enabled it to achieve that objective.\n\n2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nSecond, the Trailhawk did not emerge from our off-road excursion without some battle damage. The front lower bumper — that area of plastic below the Jeep’s tow hooks — took a bash from a rock somewhere along the trail and got both dented (which we likely could fix with a heat gun) and shredded (which … we cannot). It will require replacement to bring the Trailhawk back to how it was before the event, and even though the lower matte-plastic bit looks like it should be removable, my sources say the entire front end is one enormous assembly and that the whole thing will need to be replaced. If that’s the case, it’s an odd way to engineer what is supposed to be the most off-road-capable version of the Grand Cherokee. We’ll see what a dealer says, but that could be a very costly repair job for some relatively minor cosmetic damage.\n\nAside from those two quibbles, however, the Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk proved to be an amazing off-roader, providing exceptional comfort for driver and passengers (ventilated seats are a godsend when it’s 95 degrees and dusty as hell outside), surprising capability in the wilderness and a unique experience when using its Electric mode. Can it go toe to toe with a Wrangler Rubicon? Absolutely not; just about every aspect of a Wrangler is designed to put off-road capability first and on-road comfort second. The Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk reverses that order, giving you a comfortable, luxurious on-road SUV first and a highly capable off-road machine second.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-size SUV with five seats in two rows. It’s powered by a 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 or a 375-hp, “4xe” plug-in hybrid powertrain consisting of a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and two electric motors. The PHEV uses a 17.3-kilowatt-hour battery and has an EPA-estimated electric-only driving range of 26 miles. Both engines are coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Models fitted with the V-6 can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive, while the PHEV comes solely with four-wheel drive. \n\nThe extensive tech and comfort features offered in the Grand Cherokee are impressive, especially in high-end trims like the Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve. True to Jeep tradition, the Grand Cherokee excels at all-terrain adventuring when equipped with options like an adaptive air suspension, an off-road camera system, underbody skid plates and a limited-slip differential. Rivals include the Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota 4Runner and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee was completely redesigned for 2022. As such, the Grand Cherokee sees only minor cosmetic changes for 2024, such as new wheels on a few trim levels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear parking sensors\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning \n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nRear-seat entertainment system\n10.25-inch touchscreen for front passenger\nNavigation\nNine-speaker Alpine audio system\n19-speaker McIntosh audio system\nPanoramic sunroof\nAdaptive air suspension\nWireless device charging\nHeated and ventilated front and rear seats\n21-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee?\n\nDepending on the trim, the Grand Cherokee can be a nicely appointed family runabout or a luxury SUV loaded with features including leather seats, real wood trim and a premium audio system. Keep in mind, though, that the price of the Grand Cherokee just about doubles once you’ve scaled the highest reaches of the Summit and Summit Reserve trims when fitted with the optional plug-in hybrid powertrain. If you’re considering a Grand Cherokee but need additional passenger room, the larger Grand Cherokee L has three rows of seats.",
