      "expert_review": "Jeep purists might smirk, thinking the Renegade has a fitting name, but this subcompact SUV is no Benedict Arnold: It delivers big-time off-road performance in Trailhawk form without sacrificing on-road driving refinement.\n\nThe Renegade shares its platform with the Fiat 500L. That may seem an unlikely starting point for an off-road-capable Jeep, but there are significant differences between the two. Within the Jeep family, the Italian-built Renegade is shorter and wider than both the Patriot and Compass compact SUVs, which will be replaced by a single model in the 2016 calendar year.\n\nThe subcompact SUV segment is quickly growing, with new models like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 joining existing competitors such as the Mini Countryman and Buick Encore. The Renegade, which will be at Jeep dealerships by March, joins the mix with unique features and technology designed for difficult off-road terrain.\n\nThe base Renegade Sport starts at $18,990, including a $995 destination charge, while the Latitude and Limited trim levels are $22,290 and $25,790, respectively. Four-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on all trim levels except the $26,990 Trailhawk model, where it’s standard.\n\nWe drove two pre-production versions of the Renegade: a four-wheel-drive Sport trim with a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission and a Trailhawk version with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a nine-speed automatic.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWith its round headlights and seven-slot grille, there’s no mistaking the Renegade for anything but a Jeep. Mark Allen, head of Jeep Design, said the Renegade’s upright, boxy shape let the automaker retain interior room even with the SUV’s small footprint.\n\nI really like the little details that Jeep and other Chrysler brands have been giving their cars lately, and the Renegade is no exception. There are little cues everywhere you look, from the small seven-slot grille icon integrated into the headlights to the military-style “No Step” warning on the side sills. They’re small things, but owners will delight in discovering them, and they make previous-generation Jeeps like the Patriot seem unfinished and uninspired.\n\nHow It Drives\nI was impressed with the Renegade’s ride and handling. Ride quality is firm, but suspension responses are refined.\n\nThe Renegade features frequency selective damping struts from Koni, a Jeep first. Body roll is well controlled — the Renegade remains remarkably flat even when attacking winding canyon roads — and the SUV shows admirable poise on the highway, without any of the bucking tendencies that some cars with shorter wheelbases exhibit.\n\nAnother thing that stood out was the Renegade’s quiet cabin. Despite the SUV’s boxy shape, wind noise is faint — even at highway speeds.\n\nThe Renegade offers a choice of two drivetrains, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The base 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder is a smooth-revving, refined engine that teams exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. The light-effort clutch pedal and precise manual shifter are fun to work. That’s good, because you have to use them quite a bit to make the most of the engine’s modest power. Its sweet spot is around 4,000 rpm; below that, it doesn’t feel very strong.\n\nThe optional 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder feels a little stouter, but not dramatically so. Granted, I tested it in a Trailhawk model, which is the heaviest version of the Renegade, weighing in at 3,573 pounds.\n\nThe 2.4-liter four-cylinder and nine-speed automatic are the same engine and transmission in Cars.com’s long-term 2014 Jeep Cherokee. We’ve experienced problems with the transmission’s responsiveness and shift quality in our Cherokee, and the SUV recently received a new engine under warranty. The lighter Renegade, however, has a completely different calibration package than the Cherokee, according to Jeep, and while it doesn’t exhibit the occasional abrupt shift that our Cherokee does, it’s still not perfect.\n\nThe biggest problem with the automatic transmission is it’s slow to kick down when you need more power. Floor the gas pedal and the automatic waits a moment before it decides to slowly shift to a lower gear. There’s no urgency even when that’s exactly what’s needed.\n\nThe transmission was also in too high a gear more than once when exiting a tight turn, robbing the 2.4-liter engine of power. Pressing the gas pedal farther brought a downshift, but the automatic needs to be smart enough to stay in a lower gear so a downshift isn’t necessary.\n\nI experienced the Trailhawk’s considerable off-road capabilities. After crawling up rock-strewn paths, navigating deeply rutted terrain and descending steep dirt tracks, my lasting impression is how easy the Renegade made it all seem.\n\nThe Trailhawk has a number of unique elements designed for off-road driving: It gets an extra 0.8 inches of ground clearance, for a total of 8.7 inches, along with front and rear tow hooks that are rated at twice the Renegade’s gross vehicle weight in case you need to be yanked out of a ditch — or yank someone else out. There are also skid plates for the front suspension, transmission, transfer case and gas tank, as well as different lower front trim that gives it a better approach angle.\n\nThe Trailhawk also gets a special four-wheel-drive system dubbed Active Drive Low. Rather than using a two-speed transfer case with a low range, the Trailhawk uses its 4.33-to-1 axle ratio and the nine-speed automatic’s short gears to achieve a 20-to-1 crawl ratio for off-roading. Hill descent control is standard, and I like how the system lets you adjust the descent speed using the gas and brake pedals.\n\nOfficial EPA gas mileage estimates weren’t available as of publication, but Jeep says the Renegade will get more than 30 mpg on the highway with either of its four-cylinder engines. That figure is, in all likelihood, for the most efficient versions; expect heavier four-wheel-drive models like the Trailhawk to get lower EPA estimates.\n\nInterior\nDespite its small footprint, the Renegade accommodates taller passengers. The front bucket seats have firm but comfortable cushioning, while the rear bench seat provides decent comfort and legroom.\n\nOverall interior quality is good, and the attention to detail that’s present on the Renegade’s exterior carries over to the cabin. You see it in things like the storage bin mat, which incorporates a trail map design, as well as the tachometer, which has a splatter graphic inspired by paintballing instead of a regular redline.\n\nThe Renegade also features soft-touch dashboard trim. While it looks nice, I would have preferred if Jeep had padded the upper door trim instead; I like to rest my arm there when driving, but its current hard-plastic finish isn’t the most comfortable.\n\nRather than a traditional moonroof, the Renegade is available with an optional My Sky sunroof that features two removable fiberglass-polyurethane roof panels that stow in a bag in the cargo area. An uplevel version of My Sky adds a power tilt/slide feature to the front panel.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Renegade’s controls are thoughtfully arranged, and — just as important — it has the right kind of controls in the right places. The climate control system has large knobs, and there are familiar dashboard buttons.\n\nAll models have a standard MP3 jack and USB connectivity, and three Uconnect multimedia systems are offered. The base Uconnect 3.0 is a traditional stereo system with a display screen, while the Uconnect 5.0 and 6.5 systems both have touch-screens and Bluetooth streaming audio. The Uconnect 6.5 system also incorporates navigation.\n\nThe Uconnect 6.5 interface is similar to Jeep’s Uconnect 8.4 system, but the latter has a bigger 8.4-inch touch-screen. Uconnect 8.4 has received quite a bit of praise from Cars.com editors for its ease of use. The Renegade’s smaller 6.5-inch touch-screen is responsive and seemed big enough, and I like how Jeep includes physical knobs for volume and tuning functions.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area measures 18.5 cubic feet. With the rear seats folded there’s 50.8 cubic feet of cargo space. The Chevrolet Trax has a similar amount of cargo room (18.7/48.4 cubic feet), but the Honda HR-V surpasses them both (24.3/58.8 cubic feet). A removable, height-adjustable cargo-floor panel is standard.\n\nSafety\nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-test ratings weren’t available as of publication.\n\nA number of advanced safety features are optional. The Safety and Security Package includes a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, while the Advanced Technology Package adds lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic braking, and rear parking sensors. A backup camera is also optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe subcompact SUV segment that the Renegade is part of is relatively new, but it’s quickly gaining steam as automakers look for new ways to appeal to shoppers more interested in SUVs and crossovers than cars. Unlike much of the competition, however, the Renegade has retained the style — and a lot of the off-road capability — of a traditional SUV. Jeep is one of the few brands that can pull off something like this, and it does it very well with the Renegade. Whether you need a small SUV for everyday driving or for leaving the road far behind, there’s a version of the Renegade for you.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV with seating for five. It has a standard 177-horsepower, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard, and competitors include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V and Subaru Crosstrek.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe entry-level Sport trim has been discontinued, as has its available front-wheel drive; the Renegade is now four-wheel drive only. The content included in various option packages has also been revised.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Jeep Renegade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nHeated side mirrors \nDual-zone automatic climate control \nPush-button start\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof \nLeather-trimmed seats \nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRemote start\nAutomatic high-beam headlights \nAdaptive cruise control\nRoof rails\nWindshield wiper de-icer\nCornering foglamps\nShould I Buy the 2023 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Renegade drives well and has a quiet cabin filled with clever design details. For anyone serious about off-roading, the Trailhawk model is one of the most capable subcompact SUVs you can buy. However, we’ve found the Renegade’s nine-speed automatic transmission to be balky at times, and some of the SUV’s interior trim is low-grade.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV with seating for five. It has a standard 177-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, and competitors include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V and Subaru Crosstrek.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Jeep Renegade?\n\nAn 8.4-inch touchscreen navigation system is now standard, and the high-end Limited trim level gets a unique grille and foglights along with 18-inch wheels. Finally, the Altitude Package features gloss-black 18-inch wheels as well as gloss-black interior and exterior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Jeep Renegade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nHeated side mirrors\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nPush-button start\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRemote start\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2022 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Renegade drives well and has a quiet cabin filled with clever design details. For anyone who’s serious about off-roading, the Trailhawk model is one of the most capable subcompact SUVs you can buy. However, we’ve found the nine-speed automatic transmission to be balky at times, and some of the SUV’s interior trim is low-grade.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2015 about the 2015 Jeep Renegade. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nJeep purists might smirk, thinking the Renegade has a fitting name, but this subcompact SUV is no Benedict Arnold: It delivers big-time off-road performance in Trailhawk form without sacrificing on-road driving refinement.\n\nThe Renegade shares its platform with the Fiat 500L. That may seem an unlikely starting point for an off-road-capable Jeep, but there are significant differences between the two. Within the Jeep family, the Italian-built Renegade is shorter and wider than both the Patriot and Compass compact SUVs, which will be replaced by a single model in the 2016 calendar year.\n\nThe subcompact SUV segment is quickly growing, with new models like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 joining existing competitors such as the Mini Countryman and Buick Encore. The Renegade, which will be at Jeep dealerships by March, joins the mix with unique features and technology designed for difficult off-road terrain.\n\nThe base Renegade Sport starts at $18,990, including a $995 destination charge, while the Latitude and Limited trim levels are $22,290 and $25,790, respectively. Four-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on all trim levels except the $26,990 Trailhawk model, where it’s standard.\n\nWe drove two pre-production versions of the Renegade: a four-wheel-drive Sport trim with a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission and a Trailhawk version with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a nine-speed automatic.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWith its round headlights and seven-slot grille, there’s no mistaking the Renegade for anything but a Jeep. Mark Allen, head of Jeep Design, said the Renegade’s upright, boxy shape let the automaker retain interior room even with the SUV’s small footprint.\n\nI really like the little details that Jeep and other Chrysler brands have been giving their cars lately, and the Renegade is no exception. There are little cues everywhere you look, from the small seven-slot grille icon integrated into the headlights to the military-style “No Step” warning on the side sills. They’re small things, but owners will delight in discovering them, and they make previous-generation Jeeps like the Patriot seem unfinished and uninspired.\n\nHow It Drives\nI was impressed with the Renegade’s ride and handling. Ride quality is firm, but suspension responses are refined.\n\nThe Renegade features frequency selective damping struts from Koni, a Jeep first. Body roll is well controlled — the Renegade remains remarkably flat even when attacking winding canyon roads — and the SUV shows admirable poise on the highway, without any of the bucking tendencies that some cars with shorter wheelbases exhibit.\n\nAnother thing that stood out was the Renegade’s quiet cabin. Despite the SUV’s boxy shape, wind noise is faint — even at highway speeds.\n\nThe Renegade offers a choice of two drivetrains, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The base 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder is a smooth-revving, refined engine that teams exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. The light-effort clutch pedal and precise manual shifter are fun to work. That’s good, because you have to use them quite a bit to make the most of the engine’s modest power. Its sweet spot is around 4,000 rpm; below that, it doesn’t feel very strong.\n\nThe optional 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder feels a little stouter, but not dramatically so. Granted, I tested it in a Trailhawk model, which is the heaviest version of the Renegade, weighing in at 3,573 pounds.\n\nThe 2.4-liter four-cylinder and nine-speed automatic are the same engine and transmission in Cars.com’s long-term 2014 Jeep Cherokee. We’ve experienced problems with the transmission’s responsiveness and shift quality in our Cherokee, and the SUV recently received a new engine under warranty. The lighter Renegade, however, has a completely different calibration package than the Cherokee, according to Jeep, and while it doesn’t exhibit the occasional abrupt shift that our Cherokee does, it’s still not perfect.\n\nThe biggest problem with the automatic transmission is it’s slow to kick down when you need more power. Floor the gas pedal and the automatic waits a moment before it decides to slowly shift to a lower gear. There’s no urgency even when that’s exactly what’s needed.\n\nThe transmission was also in too high a gear more than once when exiting a tight turn, robbing the 2.4-liter engine of power. Pressing the gas pedal farther brought a downshift, but the automatic needs to be smart enough to stay in a lower gear so a downshift isn’t necessary.\n\nI experienced the Trailhawk’s considerable off-road capabilities. After crawling up rock-strewn paths, navigating deeply rutted terrain and descending steep dirt tracks, my lasting impression is how easy the Renegade made it all seem.\n\nThe Trailhawk has a number of unique elements designed for off-road driving: It gets an extra 0.8 inches of ground clearance, for a total of 8.7 inches, along with front and rear tow hooks that are rated at twice the Renegade’s gross vehicle weight in case you need to be yanked out of a ditch — or yank someone else out. There are also skid plates for the front suspension, transmission, transfer case and gas tank, as well as different lower front trim that gives it a better approach angle.\n\nThe Trailhawk also gets a special four-wheel-drive system dubbed Active Drive Low. Rather than using a two-speed transfer case with a low range, the Trailhawk uses its 4.33-to-1 axle ratio and the nine-speed automatic’s short gears to achieve a 20-to-1 crawl ratio for off-roading. Hill descent control is standard, and I like how the system lets you adjust the descent speed using the gas and brake pedals.\n\nOfficial EPA gas mileage estimates weren’t available as of publication, but Jeep says the Renegade will get more than 30 mpg on the highway with either of its four-cylinder engines. That figure is, in all likelihood, for the most efficient versions; expect heavier four-wheel-drive models like the Trailhawk to get lower EPA estimates.\n\nInterior\nDespite its small footprint, the Renegade accommodates taller passengers. The front bucket seats have firm but comfortable cushioning, while the rear bench seat provides decent comfort and legroom.\n\nOverall interior quality is good, and the attention to detail that’s present on the Renegade’s exterior carries over to the cabin. You see it in things like the storage bin mat, which incorporates a trail map design, as well as the tachometer, which has a splatter graphic inspired by paintballing instead of a regular redline.\n\nThe Renegade also features soft-touch dashboard trim. While it looks nice, I would have preferred if Jeep had padded the upper door trim instead; I like to rest my arm there when driving, but its current hard-plastic finish isn’t the most comfortable.\n\nRather than a traditional moonroof, the Renegade is available with an optional My Sky sunroof that features two removable fiberglass-polyurethane roof panels that stow in a bag in the cargo area. An uplevel version of My Sky adds a power tilt/slide feature to the front panel.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Renegade’s controls are thoughtfully arranged, and — just as important — it has the right kind of controls in the right places. The climate control system has large knobs, and there are familiar dashboard buttons.\n\nAll models have a standard MP3 jack and USB connectivity, and three Uconnect multimedia systems are offered. The base Uconnect 3.0 is a traditional stereo system with a display screen, while the Uconnect 5.0 and 6.5 systems both have touch-screens and Bluetooth streaming audio. The Uconnect 6.5 system also incorporates navigation.\n\nThe Uconnect 6.5 interface is similar to Jeep’s Uconnect 8.4 system, but the latter has a bigger 8.4-inch touch-screen. Uconnect 8.4 has received quite a bit of praise from Cars.com editors for its ease of use. The Renegade’s smaller 6.5-inch touch-screen is responsive and seemed big enough, and I like how Jeep includes physical knobs for volume and tuning functions.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area measures 18.5 cubic feet. With the rear seats folded there’s 50.8 cubic feet of cargo space. The Chevrolet Trax has a similar amount of cargo room (18.7/48.4 cubic feet), but the Honda HR-V surpasses them both (24.3/58.8 cubic feet). A removable, height-adjustable cargo-floor panel is standard.\n\nSafety\nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-test ratings weren’t available as of publication.\n\nA number of advanced safety features are optional. The Safety and Security Package includes a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, while the Advanced Technology Package adds lane departure warning and prevention, forward collision warning with automatic braking, and rear parking sensors. A backup camera is also optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe subcompact SUV segment that the Renegade is part of is relatively new, but it’s quickly gaining steam as automakers look for new ways to appeal to shoppers more interested in SUVs and crossovers than cars. Unlike much of the competition, however, the Renegade has retained the style — and a lot of the off-road capability — of a traditional SUV. Jeep is one of the few brands that can pull off something like this, and it does it very well with the Renegade. Whether you need a small SUV for everyday driving or for leaving the road far behind, there’s a version of the Renegade for you.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2019 model year brings some big changes to the Jeep Renegade, as it’s the first refresh for the small SUV since its debut for 2015. There are styling tweaks and added safety equipment, but the big change is under the hood with the introduction of a new powertrain: a 177-horsepower, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder, which I sampled.\n\nThe first time I laid eyes on the Jeep Renegade, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. Those big, bugeyed headlights and the unconventional shape gave me pause. So did the fact that it didn’t quite look like a rugged, squared-off SUV in the same way as the rest of the Jeep lineup.\n\nRelated: How Jeep Is Making the Compass and Renegade Less Poky, More Off-Roady\n\nBut after driving (and seeing them on the road), my stance softened. With familiarity came a modicum of appreciation for the Renegade. That funky shape gives it a high ceiling, and it feels roomier than most of the other subcompact SUVs. Plus, I can get behind the no-frills multimedia system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nThough It Be Small, It Is Fierce\n\nThe new engine sounds like it should be less powerful given that it only has 1.3 liters of displacement and four cylinders. But a turbocharger can work wonders and though the engine is small, it pumps out 177 hp and a mind-blowing 200 pounds-feet of torque. It comes with the nine-speed automatic transmission, which doesn’t bode well, as this is a transmission we’ve had problems with in the past.\n\nLast year’s standard engine remains: a 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 175 pounds-feet of torque. It’s also mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission, and this powertrain was not loved by our staff; in fact, the lack of refinement from this combination bears the brunt of the responsibility for the Renegade’s poor performance in our 2015 test to find the best subcompact SUV.\n\nBoth Renegades I drove, a Limited and a Trailhawk, had all-wheel drive and come standard with the new engine (the engine is available on Sport and Latitude models as a $1,495 option). The smaller engine has an edge in fuel economy, topping out at 27 mpg combined for FWD models and 26 mpg combined for AWD models. With the base engine, those figures sit at 25 mpg and 24 mpg respectively, so you gain 2 mpg with the optional engine. The exception is the Trailhawk, which also gets 24 mpg combined due to its higher ride height and added equipment.\n\n2019 Jeep Renegade | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nDriving the Renegade on the road, the improvements to the powertrain are immediately noticeable. This thing has some go-go to it and if you get it the engine speed up, the Renegade becomes a little bit frisky. It hustles ably from a stop and though there’s a slight hesitation when passing, once the transmission takes a second to get settled, the power pours on smoothly all the way up to 70 mph and beyond.\n\nIt’s not a perfect experience, however. The Trailhawk still had too much transmission lag and a busy, trucklike ride. That’s due in part to the difference in tires and ground clearance between the Trailhawk and the Limited; it has a more aggressive set of off-road-oriented tires and extra ground clearance. The Limited rides better, but it also had a noticeably smoother transmission that seemed to follow a more logical shift pattern.\n\nThe difference I experienced on the street led me to ask if the two had different transmission tuning or even different gear ratios. Jeep confirmed that the two transmissions are identical in both hardware and tuning, so it’s curious that I noticed such a contrast. If you plan to buy a Renegade, be sure to drive a couple of trim levels first to see how they compare for you.\n\nDriving the Renegade Off-Road\n\nOne of the Renegade’s calling cards continues to be its off-road prowess, especially the Trailhawk. It gives the Renegade a unique positioning in this class, as there isn’t another small SUV that can do the things it can when the pavement ends. As mentioned, the Trailhawk has added ground clearance (8.7 inches versus 8.0 inches for other AWD models), skid plates, 21:1 crawl ratio, hill descent control and the ability to ford water 19 inches deep.\n\n2019 Jeep Renegade | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nI took the Renegade on an off-road loop that included rock crawling, climbs up loose dirt and gravel, and even a steep downgrade to show off the hill descent control. It’s not a Wrangler, but it’s pretty untouchable in this environment among competitors – there’s enough dexterity and tire right out of the box to handle dirt roads and camping duty. Only real rock crawling where you need a lot of suspension flex will stop this little ‘ute.\n\nWhat’s the Rub?\n\nI like the Renegade’s copious amounts of headroom and the new dual-pane panoramic moonroof, and I’ve come around on how it looks. But for such a small thing, it has two big catches: pricing and safety equipment.\n\nBoth the Limited I tested and the Trailhawk made my eyes bulge with their price tags: $34,860 (including destination) for the Limited and $36,005 for the Trailhawk. That pushes them up a class —  for perspective with the competition, a 2019 Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD starts at $36,145 and a 2019 Honda CR-V AWD starts at $35,195. Those are both larger SUVs that offer more cargo utility and passenger room.\n\nThat’s not even the highest I know the Renegade Limited can go, as my test vehicle didn’t include the Advanced Technology Package that’s required if you want automatic forward emergency braking, lane keep assist or adaptive cruise control. A blind spot warning system  comes as part of a separate package. For all of the Renegade’s off-road chops and fun, quirky looks, it’s far behind the rest of the field when it comes to availability of safety technology (especially compared to the Toyota C-HR, which comes with most of the above features standard) and will be something that Jeep must address when the Renegade eventually gets a redesign.\n\n2019 Jeep Renegade | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Jeep Renegade is a subcompact SUV with seating for five people. It comes standard with a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a nine-speed automatic transmission. A 177-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder is also available. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, and competitors include the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V and Hyundai Kona.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Jeep Renegade?\n\nA Kenwood premium stereo is now available for all trim levels but the Sport.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Jeep Renegade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard convenience features include cruise control, heated side mirrors and air conditioning. Available features include a panoramic moonroof, leather-trimmed seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and navigation. Available active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist and automatic high-beam headlights. For anyone who’s serious about off-roading, the Trailhawk is one of the most capable subcompact SUVs you can buy.\n\n2020 Jeep Renegade Vs. 2020 Chevrolet Trax: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Renegade and Trax have a lot in common besides their city-friendly proportions. The Trax offers the higher seating position and available all-wheel drive many SUV shoppers want, but it doesn’t go as far as the Renegade does in Trailhawk form. If we’re being honest, however, not many subcompact SUV owners are venturing deep into the woods. The Chevy’s four-cylinder engine is weak, but the Trax does offer a lot of standard tech features.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Renegade drives well and features a quiet cabin filled with clever design details. As we’ve pointed out, the Trailhawk has excellent off-road credentials. We’ve found the nine-speed automatic transmission to be balky at times, so a test drive consisting of city, suburban and highway driving is recommended before purchasing.",

New 80th Anniversary, Jeepster and Islander editions add features and unique trim.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Jeep Renegade Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCruise control \nHeated side mirrors \nDual-zone automatic air conditioning \nPush-button start\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof \nLeather-trimmed seats \nHeated front seats\n8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system with navigation \nAutomatic high-beam headlights \nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2021 Jeep Renegade?\n\nThe Renegade drives well and has a quiet cabin filled with clever design details. For anyone who’s serious about off-roading, the Trailhawk model is one of the most capable subcompact SUVs you can buy. We’ve found the nine-speed automatic transmission to be balky at times, so a test drive consisting of city, suburban and highway driving is recommended before purchasing.",
