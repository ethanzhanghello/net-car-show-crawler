      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Subaru Crosstrek?\nThe Subaru Crosstrek is a five-seat subcompact SUV that comes standard with all-wheel drive and is focused on outdoor adventures. The base trim is powered by a 152-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. All other trims — Premium, Sport, Limited and Wilderness — come with a 182-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder. With either engine, the lone transmission is a continuously variable automatic. The Crosstrek’s rivals include the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Kia Seltos, Toyota Corolla Cross and Volkswagen Taos.   \nWhat’s New on the 2025 Subaru Crosstrek?\nThe Crosstrek was redesigned for the 2024 model year. The only noteworthy change for 2025 is that the available 2.5-liter engine and dual-function X-Mode with hill descent control are now standard on the Premium trim; they previously came only on the Sport, Limited and Wilderness trim levels. A Crosstrek Hybrid is slated to join the Crosstrek lineup for the 2026 model year. \nWhat Features in the 2025 Subaru Crosstrek Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nCloth seats\nUSB-A charge port\nFour-speaker stereo\nRear-seat reminder\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n11.6-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRaised suspension (Wilderness)\nAll-terrain tires\nMoonroof\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nShould I Buy the 2025 Subaru Crosstrek?\nThough it’s technically a raised, SUV-ized version of Subaru’s Impreza compact hatchback, the Crosstrek works very well as a versatile subcompact SUV for outdoorsy owners. Sluggish acceleration is the Crosstrek’s biggest demerit; even the optional four-cylinder is lethargic. On the plus side, fuel economy is good, and passenger and cargo space are decent given the Crosstrek’s tidy exterior dimensions. The range-topping Wilderness trim is further fortified for rough terrain and should also appeal to those who intend to take their Crosstrek off-road regularly.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Subaru simply needed to not screw up a good thing with the redesigned 2024 Crosstrek. Mission accomplished.\n\nVersus the competition: Other subcompact SUVs may be quicker, some may have better tech, but few can match the Crosstrek’s combination of genuine go-anywhere energy, excellent comfort and stellar space efficiency at this level of screaming value.\n\nHere’s a fun fact: Last year, Subaru sold more Crosstreks than any year in the model’s nearly 12-year history. Despite it being an older design in its last months before the redesign you see here, and with minimal incentives (especially compared with its competitors), people still snapped up the compact quasi-SUV in ever larger numbers. So when it came time for Subaru to redesign the global platform that underpins its Impreza, WRX, and yes, its Crosstrek, the only thing the automaker really had to do was not screw it up.\n\nRelated: 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Loads Up on Tech and Safety, Keeps $26,000 Price Tag\n\nBut that’s easier said than done, given the number of things that were set to change for the 2024 Crosstrek — it has a heavily revised and reinforced chassis, a new suspension tune, a significantly updated powertrain, aerodynamic changes, a new interior, and refinements to its all-wheel-drive system and EyeSight driver-assist suite.\n\nThat’s a lot to change, and a lot of opportunity to change things for change’s sake, something increasing numbers of Crosstrek buyers simply do not seem to want. So how did Subie do with the new ‘24 Crosstrek? At Subaru’s invitation, I spent a couple of days in Palm Springs, Calif., to drive the new model to find out (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events), and I can confidently say that despite all the work that went into redoing the Crosstrek for 2024, the old model’s familiar attributes still shine brightly.\n\nCan You Spot the Changes?\n\nLooking at the all-new Crosstrek, you’d be forgiven for not being able to see what’s changed. The new model is marginally larger than the outgoing one, but the overall shape and sheet metal still looks largely the same. There are new headlights (LEDs on all four trim levels), a new grille, new taillights, new wheel openings and some neat styling flourishes (check out the louvered outlets on the front wheel arches that channel air out of the wheel well for improved handling stability) that are actually functional. The Crosstrek still features a standard, robust roof rack that can support 700 static pounds (say, a big tent and two sleeping campers while the car is parked) or 175 dynamic pounds (that tent, folded and stored, while the car is in motion). It still features a tall ride height for decent ground clearance and now has a few more underbody covers for better aerodynamics.\n\nDoes it still look quirky and weird, like a hiking-boot roller skate? Yes it does, and that is exactly the kind of aesthetic and image that Subaru is looking to convey — because that is exactly what Crosstrek customers are looking to buy, according to Subaru’s research. Crosstrek buyers don’t want a simple commuter car, according to the company’s numbers, they want an adventure vehicle that can take them camping, hiking and into the woods, but one that will also serve during the week as their commuter, grocery getter or family hauler. That’s what Subaru has been delivering with the prior Crosstrek, and that’s what it’s successfully cooked up for the new 2024 version, as well.\n\nRefinements Aplenty\n\nSo if it doesn’t honestly look all that different, what exactly did Subaru do to the thing with this redesign? The name of the game is refinement, starting with the engine. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder boxer that sadly only pumps out 152 horsepower and 145 pounds-feet of torque, shunting it through a continuously variable automatic transmission to all four wheels. If that doesn’t sound like a recipe for speed, well, it’s not. Acceleration is best described as barely adequate, and that’s with only two people and no gear in the car — I can’t imagine how genuinely slow to accelerate the Crosstrek must be when you load it with four people and a few hundred pounds of camping gear then attempt to ascend into the Rocky Mountains for an adventure. A larger 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making a still-unimpressive 182 hp is also available, but only in the up-level Sport and Limited trims; the Base and Premium trims are stuck with the 2.0-liter. It’s not new to call the Crosstrek underpowered, but Subaru insists a bigger engine is not what its customers are clamoring for. Given that Crosstreks are selling in record numbers, the sales data most assuredly backs up Subaru’s claim. More power is not what shoppers want in a Crosstrek, evidently, so more power is not what you’re getting for 2024.\n\nWhat you are getting is more refinement. The engine and the rest of the drivetrain has been thoroughly reworked to eliminate vibration and noise, with Subaru claiming a 20% drop in vibration. This is evident in the far greater smoothness of the engine during normal operation and under full throttle; it doesn’t feel at all like the cringe-worthy, agricultural-quality tractor motor that it used to resemble. Noise reaching the cabin has been cut way back, and it makes for a far more refined experience when you inevitably plant your foot to the floor on a highway on-ramp. At idle and around town, the powertrain exhibits Toyota-levels of smoothness and calm. It really is an impressive rework of a familiar engine. If only y’all wanted a turbo …\n\nNew Levels of Cushy\n\nIf the acceleration isn’t anything impressive, this is more than made up for with spectacular ride quality. The Premium trim I drove (the only one available, the higher-spec Sport and Limited arrive this summer) comes equipped with 17-inch wheels and all-season tires, but the suspension is clearly tuned toward comfort over sharp handling. This might be one of the most softly sprung vehicles I’ve driven in a long time, confirmed by the vehicle’s chief engineer, who stated that the big suspension change from last year’s model is that spring rates have been softened up. The Crosstrek positively glides over smooth pavement with no road noise or vibration, and surface imperfections are swallowed up with thumps and brief bumps.\n\nThe trade-off for this are handling characteristics that are also softened up, but not in a bad way. Refined is again the operative word — body control is just fine, with the Crosstrek able to hustle through sweeping, twisty roads at high speeds without upsetting the composure of the car or its occupants. The brakes are firm, progressive and strong, and they provide excellent feedback. The newly upgraded steering that Subaru has taken from the sporty WRX sedan provides adequate accuracy, but loses the WRX’s sharpness and feedback due to the Crosstrek’s less aggressive tires.\n\nWhere the softness of the Crosstrek comes in handy is in the dirt. I piloted the Crosstrek down some California desert Jeep trails and up various steep, slippery, loose rock piles near Joshua Tree National Park, and aside from occasionally rubbing its front end on approach, the Crosstrek rolled up, over and down anything I pointed it at. The X-Mode system helps to manage traction in situations where all four wheels need it and also activates hill descent control functions. You won’t, however, be taking a Crosstrek too far into the wilderness — it has no selectable locking differential, no serious underbody protection, no true all-terrain tires and no true four-wheel drive with low-range — and while ground clearance is good for logging roads, it’s not enough for bouldering. But it can still easily take you to a rural campsite, let you launch a kayak by a muddy river or get you to a hiking trailhead, exactly the things over a third of Crosstrek owners like to do.\n\nOne nice update has been to the EyeSight driver-assist safety system, a suite of electronic sensors and cameras that combines all sorts of functions like forward collision alert, lane departure warning and other systems to help keep you safe from yourself and others on the road. The Crosstrek even has a new available emergency steering feature that will automatically steer around an obstacle that’s slightly in your path, like a car pulling out from a curb that you don’t notice.\n\nEyeSight has been the benefit of some serious refinement, and this marks the first time in many years that I didn’t find myself turning off the system shortly after beginning to drive, as I didn’t find it nearly as intrusive, nannying or annoying as it has been in nearly every other Subaru I’ve tried. It’s no longer constantly bleeping and blurping at you; it seems to have calmed down a bit, and that’s a good thing — a safety minder that annoys the driver so much that they turn it off when they get in the car is a useless feature. The refinements to the newest version mean it’s far more likely to be useful and effective.\n\nComfort Over Craziness\n\nSlip inside the new Crosstrek and everything will look familiar to a Subaru owner. Maybe too familiar — it doesn’t seem all that different from the last Crosstrek, with perhaps the exception of the newly optional 11.6-inch vertically oriented multimedia screen that combines a lot of functions into one big touch panel. Multimedia is up top, and climate control is down below, but unlike many competitors, Subaru hasn’t put all of the controls into the touchscreen. Simple things like a volume knob, temperature-adjustment buttons and seat-heater switches are all still physical controls, which we applaud. Just about everything else goes in the touchscreen, however, but it’s a big, clear, easy-to-use system, so despite having too many icons on the screen and feeling like you’re using an iPad while driving, it remains a mostly positive experience. The only bug in the system is a tricky process for pairing a phone to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, which now work wirelessly.\n\nComfort is king in the new Crosstrek; the Premium trim (which is the one most customers buy, followed closely by the top-spec Limited, according to Subaru’s product planners) features high-quality cloth wrapping truly squishy, comfortable thrones. Front-seat comfort is excellent, and even backseat comfort does well, providing a lot more legroom and headroom than many competitors in this class, even with the optional power moonroof. One nit to pick: There’s no height adjustability for the front passenger seat at this trim level, and taller passengers may find their head up against the moonroof or the overhead grab handle. The easy way to avoid that is to forgo the power moonroof option, and save a little coin, too.\n\nThe cargo area is useful and easy to expand, with seatbacks that drop easily from the rear of the vehicle to form a flat load floor. This makes stowing larger, bulkier objects a breeze, not to mention things like bikes or camping gear that you don’t want to tie to the roof. Optional rubber mats for the cargo floor and even the rear seatbacks make putting dirty gear in the Crosstrek a no-brainer, as they’re all easily removable and washable. Putting things into the cargo area can be a bit of a lift with the higher ride height and tall bumper lip of the SUV.\n\nMaterials, workmanship and build quality are excellent, even in this lower-spec trim. Nothing feels cheap, but if you desire more visual zoot, the higher-spec Sport and Limited trims bring more colorful options to the interior, as well as different upholstery. The Premium trim is aimed at being a good balance between features and cost, and it succeeds quite well in that mission.\n\nThe Rarest Trait of All: It’s a Bargain\n\nOne of the biggest reasons Crosstrek owners buy the thing, according to Subaru, is the value equation — you can get a lot of car for your money when you factor in all the standard features, safety systems, all-weather and all-terrain capability, and surprising comfort. The starting price for a ‘24 Crosstrek is nearly the same as the automatic-transmission-equipped ‘23 model — $26,290 (all prices include destination) — and the cheaper six-speed manual Crosstrek is no more. The Premium trim I tested rang in at $29,685, including $2,245 for the All-Weather Package, blind spot detection with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert, and a power moonroof.\n\nTo come in under thirty grand for a car equipped with this much kit and that provides comfort, safety, go-anywhere potential and standard AWD is extraordinary these days. Who cares that it’s underpowered? Crosstrek buyers certainly don’t, and I can see why — the Crosstrek makes up for it with a totally pleasant, comfortable driving experience for a shockingly wide variety of uses and conditions. The old one did that, and the new one does it, too. Subaru succeeded in not screwing up the formula, and customers will be thrilled with the result.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2024 Subaru Crosstrek: Small Tweaks, Happy Campers\n2024 Subaru Impreza Sheds the Sedan, Leaving a Sportier, Techier Hatchback\nSubaru Reveals Minor Updates, Pricing for 2024 Legacy, Outback\nResearch Compact SUVs\nShop for a Subaru Crosstrek\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We liked the original Subaru Crosstrek — an Impreza-based, butched-up, soft-roader hatchback — enough that it won our Subcompact SUV Challenge in 2015. Now, a second-generation Crosstrek has arrived, and while it may look similar to the outgoing one, it is indeed an all-new car. Sitting on the new Subaru Global Platform that will form the basis of nearly all of Subaru’s future cars, the 2018 Crosstrek is more than 95 percent new. Again based on the Impreza, it’s a compact hatchback with exceptional interior SUV-like room and standard all-wheel drive.\n\nGo-Anywhere Looks\n\nThe change from Impreza to Crosstrek starts with the parts you can see. The Subaru Crosstrek’s sheet metal shares some panels with the Impreza, but gray plastic wheel arches, bumper covers and rocker panels add some durability to the look. It sits visibly higher than the Impreza, with 8.7 inches of ground clearance.\n\nAll the changes, like them or not, really do set it apart from the Impreza; it looks like a very different animal, and this is part of what its customers find appealing, according to Subaru. A lot of customers like that outdoorsy, rugged look — even if far more Crosstreks are sold in urban markets than in rural ones. But that higher ride height helps when dealing with broken pavement and the travails of the urban jungle, as well, such as curbs and potholes. And for buyers who are genuinely outdoorsy, the low overall roof height helps when loading things onto the roof rack.\n\nFun, But Not Fast\n\nAlong with the new platform comes a new engine, although its specs will be familiar. Like the last Crosstrek, the new one comes with a 2.0-liter flat-four engine, this one making 152 horsepower and 145 pounds-feet of torque. That’s up slightly in the horsepower department from the past model. Though not turbocharged, it does now feature direct injection. It can be mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission (one gear more than last year’s five-speed) or a continuously variable automatic with a stepped-gear function meant to make it feel and sound more like a traditional geared automatic. All-wheel drive is standard for both transmissions.\n\nI sampled both transmissions and have come to the rare conclusion that the CVT-equipped model is the one to have. This is odd given my penchant for enjoying shifting on my own, but the problem here is the engine, not the transmission: My biggest beef with the old Crosstrek was that it couldn’t get out of its own way — it was woefully underpowered with both the manual and automatic. This has not been solved with the new vehicle, as the 2.0-liter engine is still anemic. The engine is just gutless; merging onto a swift-moving highway will be challenging, and don’t even think of attempting to pass anyone on a hill or with a full load of passengers or cargo.\n\nFrom a standing start, it feels like acceleration can be measured with a calendar. If you’ve already got some momentum built, it’s not quite so bad; the Crosstrek responds quickly when you power through a corner. The CVT is well-matched to the engine, always keeping it on boil if you’re driving aggressively, but you’ll need to be prepared for it to rev its heart out as it tries to deliver what little power it has. There’s little oomph below 2,500 rpm, and it seems to run out a little after 4,000 rpm. If you opt for the manual transmission, you’ll be shifting it like mad to try and keep your speed up even on slight grades. Save yourself the angst and go for the CVT; it’s a much more pleasant experience.\n\nThe upside of the underwhelming acceleration is top-of-the-pack fuel economy. The Crosstrek is EPA-rated 27/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined with the CVT, 23/29/25 mpg with the manual. Its 33-mpg highway rating is tops for the AWD class, even besting competitors’ front-wheel-drive models. I question whether anyone will get those numbers in practice, however, as they’ll all likely drive with a heavier foot than normal just to keep up with traffic.\n\nThe engine performance is the only blemish on what has become a polished, quiet and surprisingly refined vehicle. Base and Premium trims come with 17-inch wheels, and if you plan on doing any rough-road driving or off-road exploring, this is the combination to have (though you can skip the larger 18-inch wheels, whose lower-profile tires aren’t nearly as bump-absorbing, especially off-road). It’s remarkably compliant on two-track rough roads, soaking up bumps and not transmitting any unpleasant vibrations through the steering wheel. Credit the dramatically stiffer structure of the Subaru Global Platform, which has allowed Subaru to get more creative with its suspension and steering tuning.\n\nOn-road or off, the Subaru Crosstrek’s steering is excellent. It uses a quick, 13:1 ratio — much sportier than most vehicles in its class and closer to the BRZ sports car than anything else in Subaru’s lineup. This gives the Crosstrek entertaining handling: It’s eager to turn into curves, communicative when it’s in them and easy to control when you get a little over-eager on dirt roads. Just like the BRZ, it’s slow, but once you build some speed, the car’s handling characteristics make it highly entertaining. Maintain momentum in spirited driving, and it’s actually fun to drive.\n\nMaybe You Don’t Really Need a Jeep?\n\nThe Crosstrek is surprisingly capable off-road. Subaru included its X-Mode low-speed off-road feature on the Subaru Crosstrek for the first time (it’s already on the Outback and Forester). When activated at speeds below 13 mph, X-Mode changes throttle, stability control, traction control and all-wheel-drive settings to let you get out of sticky off-road situations, or descend slippery slopes with electronic hill descent control. I climbed some steep quarry slopes and descended them again with the computer controlling much of the car’s powertrain and braking actions.\n\nIt was an impressive performance for a vehicle that’s not really an off-road machine. It has no underbody skid-plate protection, no true creeper gear and no locking axles, plus it wears all-season on-road tires. But if you have to cross some rough terrain to get to your favorite trailhead or river entry, the Subaru Crosstrek will be perfectly capable of getting you there.\n\nBigger and Better Inside\n\nThe new Crosstrek’s cabin is bigger than the last one. Nearly every dimension has been increased, and while it looks familiar, it’s all-new and much improved. The traditional benefits of Subaru interiors remain: a very low beltline and slim pillars, meaning outward visibility is outstanding in every direction. This is helpful on the highway but also useful off-road, as it allows you to see over the hood easily when negotiating tricky terrain.\n\nThe Crosstrek is exceptionally roomy compared with competitors like the Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V. It’s far more comfortable, especially for those passengers in the rear seats, but newer competitors like the Jeep Compass and Nissan Rogue Sport are starting to really challenge it in this department.\n\nThe same thing is true when it comes to cargo space comparisons. The Crosstrek features 20.8 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 55.3 cubic feet with the backseat folded. That’s less than the Honda HR-V, which features 24.3/58.8 cubic feet, but the Honda pays for that with decreased backseat space. The new Nissan Rogue Sport and Jeep Compass both outgun the Crosstrek in cargo space, offering 22.9/61.1 and 27.2/59.8 cubic feet, respectively. The Crosstrek’s advantage is in backseat passenger room, where its width gives it a comfort advantage over any of these competitors.\n\nNew Tech, But Not Much of It\n\nLike the Impreza, the new Crosstrek receives Subaru’s next-generation multimedia system. A 6.5-inch touchscreen display is standard and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Subaru’s Starlink suite of apps that you probably shouldn’t use while driving. Upgrade to a higher trim and you can get an 8-inch display and add navigation by TomTom, as well.\n\nIt’s finally a fully modern multimedia system, too. It no longer looks like it’s behind the times, but for a brand that’s going after millennial buyers, it’s curious that there isn’t more tech in this interior. There’s no 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot for passengers’ personal electronics, and there’s only one USB port in the whole car. Those seem like curious oversights in an all-new vehicle targeted specifically at younger buyers.\n\nWhat tech the Crosstrek does have comes instead in the safety department, where the company’s EyeSight system is optional and include adaptive cruise control. It includes lane departure warning and lane keep assist, as well as forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking. All-wheel drive is also standard in the Subaru Crosstrek, as it is in every Subaru except the BRZ. There are also adaptive LED headlights with high beam assist available.\n\nPrices Remain Appealing\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek is sized like a compact SUV but priced like a subcompact SUV. Its starting price is just $22,710 (including destination fee) for a base 2.0i model with a manual transmission; opting for the automatic transmission adds $1,000. The mid-level Premium trim starts at $23,510, while the top Limited begins at $27,210 and is available only with a CVT. Add all the options, and you’ll top out at $30,655 for a loaded Crosstrek Limited with EyeSight and navigation.\n\nCompetitors used to belong just to the subcompact crossover category, including vehicles like the Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and Nissan Juke. They’re vehicles priced the same as a Crosstrek, but a little bit smaller — some much smaller. That’s starting to change as automakers expand their offerings. The Nissan Rogue Sport is now a very viable direct competitor in size, content and abilities, as is the all-new Jeep Compass. Compare some of them here.\n\nAs small SUVs go, this is a pretty good deal for a well-equipped, fun-to-drive, highly useful little machine. The fact that it’s painfully slow just isn’t important to the hundreds of thousands of buyers who’ve snapped it up in the past five years. Now, all the other attributes that made the Subaru Crosstrek so popular have only been improved.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Prices increase slightly on all trims without any additional content.\n\nPricing: The 2022 Crosstrek starts at $23,620. Prices increase from $325-$425, depending on the trim level. Part of that comes from the destination fee, which increases to $1,175, up $125 for 2022.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022? Opt for a 2021 model if you can find one to take advantage of the slightly lower price.\n\nSubaru’s smallest SUV was refreshed for 2021 with an updated face, a new engine and an additional trim level called Sport. For 2022, there are no changes to the Crosstrek except for a small price bump. The plug-in-hybrid model, called simply the Crosstrek Hybrid, also returns unchanged and sees a price increase.\n\nRelated: 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Review: Bigger Is (Mostly) Better\n\nLike last year, the 2022 Crosstrek is again available in Base, Premium, Sport and Limited trims. Subaru’s newly available 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, borrowed from the Legacy sedan and the Forester and Outback SUVs, comes on the Crosstrek’s Sport and Limited trim levels.\n\nThe other trims, Base and Premium, still have last year’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both of these  trims again use a standard six-speed automatic; a continuously variable automatic transmission is available on those models and standard on all other trims. All-wheel drive is again standard on all trims.\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid also carries over for 2022, and it’s good for an EPA-estimated 17 miles of all-electric range on a full charge. It has a combined rating of 35 mpg thereafter and up to 90 mpg-equivalent.\n\n2022 Crosstrek Pricing\n\nFull pricing is below, followed by the price change for 2022. All prices include the destination fee, which increased $125:\n\nBase trim with a six-speed manual transmission: $23,620 ($325 increase)\nBase, CVT: $24,970 ($325)\nPremium, six-speed manual: $24,770 ($425)\nPremium, CVT: $26,120 ($425)\nSport, CVT: $27,970 ($425)\nLimited: CVT: $29,470 ($425)\nHybrid: $36,820 ($425)\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid qualifies for up to $4,502 in federal tax credits, and certain states offer rebates beyond that. The 2022 Subaru Crosstrek and Crosstrek Hybrid are on sale now.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness Review: More Capable On- and Off-Road\n2022 Subaru Outback Wilderness First Drive: More of What Outback Owners Love\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\nHow We Found the Best Affordable Small SUV\nFind your next car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Refreshed for 2021, the Subaru Crosstrek remains a practical choice. Though it lacks a few must-have technologies, it offers relatively generous ride comfort and seating space.\nVersus the competition: The Crosstrek is a larger alternative to the entry-level SUVs it’s priced against — a position that pays everyday dividends. The current generation first appeared back in early 2017, however; as such, certain features have become outdated.\nHeadlining the updates for 2021 is Subaru’s newly available 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, borrowed from the Legacy sedan and the Forester and Outback SUVs. It comes on the Crosstrek’s Sport and Limited trim levels, which are the highest of four available trims. The other trims, Base and Premium, still have last year’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Compare all four trim levels here.\nRelated: What’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    The Sport trim is new for 2021. Other changes include newly available lane-centering steering, revised suspension tuning and styling tweaks (mostly amounting to more front bumper cladding; it’s hard to believe the Crosstrek once had much less). We evaluated a well-equipped Crosstrek Limited as part of a comparison between four entry-level SUVs. Visit the related link above for the full comparison test and here to compare the 2021 and 2020 Crosstrek.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    New Engine, Old Transmission\nPaired with a continuously variable automatic transmission that raises engine revs at a tepid pace, the Crosstrek’s larger four-cylinder engine feels curiously unremarkable from a standing start. More power comes abruptly, however, if you stay on the gas, a clear indication that the bigger engine makes some 20% more power than its raspy counterpart. Subaru rates the 2.5-liter at 182 horsepower and 176 pounds-feet of torque versus 152 hp and 145 pounds-feet for the 2.0-liter; compare EPA mileage ratings here.\nGiven enough gas, the 2.5-liter Crosstrek gets out of its own way — but even then, it’s not exactly quick, reaching 60 mph in a leisurely 8.7 seconds by our testing. The transmission’s relaxed wind-up remains a weak link. CVTs a decade ago universally behaved this way, but today’s best examples are Johnny-on-the-spot with engine revs. It seems Johnny Subaru hit the snooze button again.\nRide and Handling\nOur other driving impressions run the gamut. Dynamics are improbably good: Subaru’s all-wheel drive sends enough power to the rear to slide the tail a smidge if you stand on the accelerator mid-corner. I predict zero drivers will experience that, however, as the Crosstrek’s moderate body roll and middling steering ratio don’t invite aggressive maneuvers. It bears mentioning that Subaru offers a strut-tower brace as a Crosstrek accessory, which should shore up handling and might even help with body roll (our test car did not have it).\nRide quality has long demonstrated the advantage of a larger platform than you typically get from an entry-level SUV. Subaru altered spring and shock absorber tuning for 2021 to improve drivability, but the formula remains comfort-oriented. That’s a welcome attribute in a class not known for it; rivals like the Ford EcoSport and Chevrolet Trailblazer are veritable bounce houses compared with the Crosstrek, which has a degree of shock absorption and high-speed isolation that’s closer to the larger class of compact SUVs. Indeed, the current-generation Crosstrek ranked at or near the top of the field for ride quality in comparison tests against three rivals in 2018, then again versus three different rivals in our latest testing.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Interior\nIn case its profile didn’t tip you off, the Crosstrek isn’t a particularly high-riding SUV. Though Subaru’s claimed 8.7 inches of ground clearance ranks in the SUV big leagues, the Crosstrek tied for the lowest driving position among the four SUVs in Cars.com’s comparison by our measuring tape. Modest height aside, occupant room is good. The front seats are reasonably large, if a bit unsupportive, and the backseat affords acceptable knee and head clearance for adults — never a given among entry-level SUVs. Ditto for visibility, where the Crosstrek’s narrow roof pillars and large windows aid sight lines in all directions. \nCargo space is less generous. We measured 13.0 cubic feet behind the Crosstrek’s backseat, landing it last in measured volume among the four SUVs in our comparison. That’s well short of the Kia Seltos’ group-leading 16.2 cubic feet. (Note that these cargo volume figures stem from Cars.com’s independent measurements, as we’ve found manufacturer-published cargo specs to be unreliable.)\nInterior styling is too scattershot for my taste, but cabin quality rates well. Low-budget plastics are mostly hidden at eye level, and areas where your arms and elbows touch are dutifully padded. The dashboard and armrests have double-stitched accents, and the headliner sports a genuine woven material. Subaru dropped the ball with a few rickety controls, but it’s nice to see the Crosstrek avoid most of the rampant cost-cutting we find inside most entry-level SUVs.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Tech Shortcomings\nDespite some updates for 2021, the Crosstrek’s roster of available technologies underscores that the current generation is entering its fourth model year while going up against a few newer rivals on the scene. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, but both require wired connections, not the wireless setup that’s spreading in this class. Wireless smartphone charging is unavailable, and the Crosstrek’s touchscreen lacks the instantaneous response, high-def resolution and plus-sized dimensions you’ll get from a few rivals’ displays. (A 6.5-inch display is standard, while higher trim levels like our test car get an 8-inch unit.)\nHands-on lane centering joins the Crosstrek’s available EyeSight bundle of safety and driver-assist features for 2021. It works in conjunction with adaptive cruise control, and both systems can function from highway speeds down to a halt in stop-and-go traffic. That’s a rare pairing for an affordable vehicle, but the adaptive cruise control won’t automatically hold you at a stop for more than a few seconds before you have to step on the brake. Most adaptive cruise control systems do that now courtesy of an electric parking brake, but the Crosstrek retains an old-school mechanical handbrake.\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Value in the Market\nOutdone on a few technologies, the Crosstrek landed in second place in our comparison of four SUVs. (The Kia Seltos came in first.) Parents with young children will appreciate the current generation’s strong scores in our evaluation of car-seat accommodations, as well as Subaru’s wealth of safety features. Stick-shift models don’t have EyeSight, which bundles lane-centering steering with adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane departure intervention. (Subaru’s emergency braking technology has been well rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety up through the 2020 Crosstrek, but as of this writing, the agency had yet to publish ratings on the 2021 model.) EyeSight comes standard on Crosstrek models with the optional CVT, which accounted for 97% of all new 2021 model-year Crosstrek inventory on Cars.com as of this writing.\nWith standard AWD, an automatic-equipped Crosstrek will set you back at least $24,645 (all prices include destination). That’s a tad steep for the class even after you add AWD to competitors. A stick-shift Crosstrek, if you can find one, will save you $1,350. Priced with all the available factory options, the 2021 Crosstrek tops out around $31,500. That’s a reasonable ceiling for the class, though its options are fairly basic, lacking niceties like a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate and dual-zone climate control.\nSecond-place finish notwithstanding, the Crosstrek is a clear market success. Consider: The Impreza hatchback is essentially a de-contented, lower-riding Crosstrek that costs thousands less, yet through the first nine months of 2020, the Crosstrek had outsold Impreza hatchbacks and sedans combined by more than 2 to 1. Indeed, it’s among the more popular entry-level SUVs out there, and it’s easy to see why. In a class of offbeat choices, the Crosstrek is a breath of the ordinary.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Subaru has announced pricing for the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek, as well as the all-new Crosstrek Hybrid. The third-generation model has seven available trim levels (Base, Premium, Sport, Sport Hybrid, Limited, Limited Hybrid and Wilderness) and starts at $28,415 (all prices include a $1,420 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid: Hybrid Hot Rod?\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Subaru Crosstrek will arrive at dealerships in fall 2025. Pricing for the full lineup is as follows:\n\nBase: $28,415\nPremium: $29,415\nSport: $32,045\nSport Hybrid: $35,415\nLimited: $34,415\nLimited Hybrid: $36,415\nWilderness: $35,215\nTrim Levels\n\nThe Base trim level of the Crosstrek comes with the EyeSight suite of driver-assist features as standard; it includes a forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering. Dual 7-inch touchscreens with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as are steering-responsive LED headlights, 17-inch dark-gray alloy wheels and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nThe Premium upgrades the 7-inch touchscreen to an 11.6-inch infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a four-month free trial of SiriusXM is included. Also added are six speakers, USB-A and USB-C charging ports in the front and rear center consoles, raised ladder-type roof rails and LED foglights.\n\nThe Sport adds yellow accents on the front, side and rear panels. Also added are 18-inch dark-gray alloy wheels, sporty trim accents around the interior, a wireless phone charger in the center console, an All-Weather Package and upgraded headlights with LED front signals.\n\nA heated steering wheel, emergency lane departure steering assist for oncoming traffic and driver attention warning are standard features on the Limited. The trim also features a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic emergency steering and reverse automatic braking, as well as upgrades to the interior such as orange stitching and chrome interior door handles and window switches.\n\nThe Wilderness is the highest trim available of the gas-powered Crosstrek. It comes with X-Mode, which improves traction and stability in various conditions, plus 9.3 inches of ground clearance and 17-inch matte-black alloy wheels wrapped in Yokohama Geolandar all-terrain tires. It also features revised gearing and an increased towing capacity of 3,500 pounds compared to 1,500 pounds on non-Wilderness trim levels. Inside, the Wilderness features water-resistant synthetic leather upholstery and copper accents, and outside, it features unique styling with exclusive front and rear bumpers, a hexagonal grille and unique hex-design LED foglights.\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid is new for 2026 and comes with two trims. The Sport trim comes with a standard 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 11.6-inch touchscreen with navigation. Adding to features found in the gas-powered Sport trim, the Hybrid Sport comes with blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic emergency steering and emergency lane departure steering assist for oncoming traffic. It also features a 10-way power driver’s seat with lumbar support and hybrid-exclusive 18-inch dark-gray aluminum-alloy wheels.\n\nThe Hybrid Limited has many of the standard features that the gas-powered Limited has. It adds unique 18-inch dark-gray aluminum-alloy wheels, navigation and a Harman Kardon 10-speaker sound system. An options package for $1,600 adds a moonroof and 360-degree camera.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nAll gas-powered trims of the Crosstrek come with a 2.5-liter flat-four-cylinder boxer engine that was updated for 2026 and makes 180 horsepower and 178 pounds-feet of torque. The Hybrid trims also come with a 2.5-liter flat-four engine, but it’s paired with electric motors and a high-capacity battery for 194 hp combined. All Crosstreks come with a continuously variable automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nFuel economy for the 2026 Crosstrek has not yet been announced, but for 2025, it got an EPA-rated 27/33-34/29 mpg city/highway/combined, while the Wilderness trim was rated 25/29/27 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid: A Less Extreme Approach to Electrification\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Subaru Crosstrek?\nWho Makes Subaru?\nResearch the Subaru Crosstrek\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "We liked the original Subaru Crosstrek — an Impreza-based, butched-up, soft-roader hatchback — enough that it won our Subcompact SUV Challenge in 2015. Now, a second-generation Crosstrek has arrived, and while it may look similar to the outgoing one, it is indeed an all-new car. Sitting on the new Subaru Global Platform that will form the basis of nearly all of Subaru’s future cars, the 2018 Crosstrek is more than 95 percent new. Again based on the Impreza, it’s a compact hatchback with exceptional interior SUV-like room and standard all-wheel drive.\n\nGo-Anywhere Looks\n\nThe change from Impreza to Crosstrek starts with the parts you can see. The Subaru Crosstrek’s sheet metal shares some panels with the Impreza, but gray plastic wheel arches, bumper covers and rocker panels add some durability to the look. It sits visibly higher than the Impreza, with 8.7 inches of ground clearance.\n\nAll the changes, like them or not, really do set it apart from the Impreza; it looks like a very different animal, and this is part of what its customers find appealing, according to Subaru. A lot of customers like that outdoorsy, rugged look — even if far more Crosstreks are sold in urban markets than in rural ones. But that higher ride height helps when dealing with broken pavement and the travails of the urban jungle, as well, such as curbs and potholes. And for buyers who are genuinely outdoorsy, the low overall roof height helps when loading things onto the roof rack.\n\nFun, But Not Fast\n\nAlong with the new platform comes a new engine, although its specs will be familiar. Like the last Crosstrek, the new one comes with a 2.0-liter flat-four engine, this one making 152 horsepower and 145 pounds-feet of torque. That’s up slightly in the horsepower department from the past model. Though not turbocharged, it does now feature direct injection. It can be mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission (one gear more than last year’s five-speed) or a continuously variable automatic with a stepped-gear function meant to make it feel and sound more like a traditional geared automatic. All-wheel drive is standard for both transmissions.\n\nI sampled both transmissions and have come to the rare conclusion that the CVT-equipped model is the one to have. This is odd given my penchant for enjoying shifting on my own, but the problem here is the engine, not the transmission: My biggest beef with the old Crosstrek was that it couldn’t get out of its own way — it was woefully underpowered with both the manual and automatic. This has not been solved with the new vehicle, as the 2.0-liter engine is still anemic. The engine is just gutless; merging onto a swift-moving highway will be challenging, and don’t even think of attempting to pass anyone on a hill or with a full load of passengers or cargo.\n\nFrom a standing start, it feels like acceleration can be measured with a calendar. If you’ve already got some momentum built, it’s not quite so bad; the Crosstrek responds quickly when you power through a corner. The CVT is well-matched to the engine, always keeping it on boil if you’re driving aggressively, but you’ll need to be prepared for it to rev its heart out as it tries to deliver what little power it has. There’s little oomph below 2,500 rpm, and it seems to run out a little after 4,000 rpm. If you opt for the manual transmission, you’ll be shifting it like mad to try and keep your speed up even on slight grades. Save yourself the angst and go for the CVT; it’s a much more pleasant experience.\n\nThe upside of the underwhelming acceleration is top-of-the-pack fuel economy. The Crosstrek is EPA-rated 27/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined with the CVT, 23/29/25 mpg with the manual. Its 33-mpg highway rating is tops for the AWD class, even besting competitors’ front-wheel-drive models. I question whether anyone will get those numbers in practice, however, as they’ll all likely drive with a heavier foot than normal just to keep up with traffic.\n\nThe engine performance is the only blemish on what has become a polished, quiet and surprisingly refined vehicle. Base and Premium trims come with 17-inch wheels, and if you plan on doing any rough-road driving or off-road exploring, this is the combination to have (though you can skip the larger 18-inch wheels, whose lower-profile tires aren’t nearly as bump-absorbing, especially off-road). It’s remarkably compliant on two-track rough roads, soaking up bumps and not transmitting any unpleasant vibrations through the steering wheel. Credit the dramatically stiffer structure of the Subaru Global Platform, which has allowed Subaru to get more creative with its suspension and steering tuning.\n\nOn-road or off, the Subaru Crosstrek’s steering is excellent. It uses a quick, 13:1 ratio — much sportier than most vehicles in its class and closer to the BRZ sports car than anything else in Subaru’s lineup. This gives the Crosstrek entertaining handling: It’s eager to turn into curves, communicative when it’s in them and easy to control when you get a little over-eager on dirt roads. Just like the BRZ, it’s slow, but once you build some speed, the car’s handling characteristics make it highly entertaining. Maintain momentum in spirited driving, and it’s actually fun to drive.\n\nMaybe You Don’t Really Need a Jeep?\n\nThe Crosstrek is surprisingly capable off-road. Subaru included its X-Mode low-speed off-road feature on the Subaru Crosstrek for the first time (it’s already on the Outback and Forester). When activated at speeds below 13 mph, X-Mode changes throttle, stability control, traction control and all-wheel-drive settings to let you get out of sticky off-road situations, or descend slippery slopes with electronic hill descent control. I climbed some steep quarry slopes and descended them again with the computer controlling much of the car’s powertrain and braking actions.\n\nIt was an impressive performance for a vehicle that’s not really an off-road machine. It has no underbody skid-plate protection, no true creeper gear and no locking axles, plus it wears all-season on-road tires. But if you have to cross some rough terrain to get to your favorite trailhead or river entry, the Subaru Crosstrek will be perfectly capable of getting you there.\n\nBigger and Better Inside\n\nThe new Crosstrek’s cabin is bigger than the last one. Nearly every dimension has been increased, and while it looks familiar, it’s all-new and much improved. The traditional benefits of Subaru interiors remain: a very low beltline and slim pillars, meaning outward visibility is outstanding in every direction. This is helpful on the highway but also useful off-road, as it allows you to see over the hood easily when negotiating tricky terrain.\n\nThe Crosstrek is exceptionally roomy compared with competitors like the Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V. It’s far more comfortable, especially for those passengers in the rear seats, but newer competitors like the Jeep Compass and Nissan Rogue Sport are starting to really challenge it in this department.\n\nThe same thing is true when it comes to cargo space comparisons. The Crosstrek features 20.8 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to 55.3 cubic feet with the backseat folded. That’s less than the Honda HR-V, which features 24.3/58.8 cubic feet, but the Honda pays for that with decreased backseat space. The new Nissan Rogue Sport and Jeep Compass both outgun the Crosstrek in cargo space, offering 22.9/61.1 and 27.2/59.8 cubic feet, respectively. The Crosstrek’s advantage is in backseat passenger room, where its width gives it a comfort advantage over any of these competitors.\n\nNew Tech, But Not Much of It\n\nLike the Impreza, the new Crosstrek receives Subaru’s next-generation multimedia system. A 6.5-inch touchscreen display is standard and comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Subaru’s Starlink suite of apps that you probably shouldn’t use while driving. Upgrade to a higher trim and you can get an 8-inch display and add navigation by TomTom, as well.\n\nIt’s finally a fully modern multimedia system, too. It no longer looks like it’s behind the times, but for a brand that’s going after millennial buyers, it’s curious that there isn’t more tech in this interior. There’s no 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot for passengers’ personal electronics, and there’s only one USB port in the whole car. Those seem like curious oversights in an all-new vehicle targeted specifically at younger buyers.\n\nWhat tech the Crosstrek does have comes instead in the safety department, where the company’s EyeSight system is optional and include adaptive cruise control. It includes lane departure warning and lane keep assist, as well as forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking. All-wheel drive is also standard in the Subaru Crosstrek, as it is in every Subaru except the BRZ. There are also adaptive LED headlights with high beam assist available.\n\nPrices Remain Appealing\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek is sized like a compact SUV but priced like a subcompact SUV. Its starting price is just $22,710 (including destination fee) for a base 2.0i model with a manual transmission; opting for the automatic transmission adds $1,000. The mid-level Premium trim starts at $23,510, while the top Limited begins at $27,210 and is available only with a CVT. Add all the options, and you’ll top out at $30,655 for a loaded Crosstrek Limited with EyeSight and navigation.\n\nCompetitors used to belong just to the subcompact crossover category, including vehicles like the Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and Nissan Juke. They’re vehicles priced the same as a Crosstrek, but a little bit smaller — some much smaller. That’s starting to change as automakers expand their offerings. The Nissan Rogue Sport is now a very viable direct competitor in size, content and abilities, as is the all-new Jeep Compass. Compare some of them here.\n\nAs small SUVs go, this is a pretty good deal for a well-equipped, fun-to-drive, highly useful little machine. The fact that it’s painfully slow just isn’t important to the hundreds of thousands of buyers who’ve snapped it up in the past five years. Now, all the other attributes that made the Subaru Crosstrek so popular have only been improved.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek straddles the line between high-riding wagon and small SUV. The Crosstrek’s proportions make it more agile than many larger SUVs, and its outdoorsy appeal is boosted by standard all-wheel drive and a cabin with a no-nonsense layout and excellent outward visibility. A lethargic 152-horsepower four-cylinder serves as the base powertrain, but an available 182-hp four-cylinder adds more sizzle. Subaru also offers a plug-in-hybrid version of the Crosstrek with an estimated electric-only driving range of 17 miles, but it’s priced considerably higher than the rest of the range. Direct competitors include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Hyundai Kona, Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-30.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nAn all-new Crosstrek is expected for the 2024 model year, so changes are few. A Crosstrek Special Edition joins the lineup, coming exclusively in Desert Khaki paint with dark-gray exterior trim and fitted with 17-inch dark-gray alloy wheels. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n6.5-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nOne USB port\nBluetooth\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic climate control\nFour-speaker stereo\nSix-speed manual transmission\nRearview camera\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nPush-button start\nHarman Kardon audio system\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nMoonroof\n8-inch touchscreen\nLeather seating\nNavigation\nEight-speaker stereo\nBlind spot warning system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nThe Crosstrek stands out thanks to a combination of go-anywhere capability and everyday driving comfort. While it’s not as large as some rival SUVs, the Crosstrek’s smaller proportions make it easier to dart through traffic and navigate narrow woodland trails. The interior won’t win any design awards, but the major controls are logically placed and there’s ample occupant space. Forward progress is modest with the base engine, so it’s worth considering the peppier 182-hp four-cylinder if highway passing power is important to you.",
