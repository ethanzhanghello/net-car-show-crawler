      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV that impresses us with its cargo space, visibility and peppy engine, but its shortcomings include a choppy ride, soft brakes and a drab interior.\n\nVersus the competition: The Forester is at the head of the compact SUV class when it comes to practicality and utility, but competitors offer nicer interiors and more rewarding driving attributes.\n\nThe Forester is styled more like an SUV than Subaru’s other compact vehicles, the Impreza and Crosstrek. Changes are minimal for 2016, with all Forester models getting a touch-screen multimedia system (6.2 inches is the standard size). A subscription-based emergency communication system is also now available. Compare the 2016 Forester with the 2015 model here.\n\nWe tested a 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Limited with an option package that included adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with autonomous braking, an upgraded stereo and a 7.0-inch multimedia screen.\n\nThe Forester competes with small SUVs such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Mazda CX-5. You can compare them all here. For a more in-depth comparison against a wider selection of SUVs, check out our $28,000 SUV Challenge.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Forester doesn’t break any new ground in the styling department; Subaru stayed with the traditional, boxy SUV look. It’s not ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but its distinguishing characteristic is that — at least to my eyes — the wheels appear too small for the body.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Forester offers good acceleration from a stop and power is generally good across the range. The Forester uses a continuously variable automatic transmission, and its immediate response makes it one of the better ones on the market. For my money, the Honda CR-V’s CVT is the best in the segment, but the Forester is a close second. I find the Rogue’s CVT to be disappointing in its weird, elastic response. Still, no CVT can match a well-designed conventional automatic transmission, so all these SUVs trail the CX-5 in terms of response.\n\nOverall power is modest, with the Forester just not feeling as quick as the CR-V or CX-5. And it’s noisy. Wind and road noise aren’t so bad, but there’s more engine noise in the Forester than its competitors.\n\nStopping with confidence isn’t really the Forester’s strong suit, either. It has a very soft, mushy brake pedal.\n\nRide comfort is a mixed bag. The Forester absorbs bumps and big potholes very well, but there can be an odd bouncing/bucking sensation, as if the front is diving and the rear is rising when the road is really bad. It just feels choppy. The CR-V again leads the category in this area, and I’d put the Rogue second, the Forester third and the sporty, rough-riding CX-5 last in terms of ride comfort.\n\nWhen it comes to handling, the Forester is surprisingly capable and willing to be pushed, but it’s let down both by its mushy brakes and by its steering. The Forester’s steering simply gets too light at higher speeds, so it doesn’t offer enough feedback to inspire confidence.\n\nThe Forester we tested is rated 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined, which is competitive with all-wheel-drive versions of the CR-V (25/31/27 mpg), CX-5 (24/30/26 mpg) and Rogue (25/32/28 mpg). Unlike the Forester, which has standard all-wheel drive, those other models also offer front-wheel drive, which boosts the Honda’s combined rating by 2 mpg and the Mazda’s by 3 mpg. (The FWD Rogue’s city and highway figures are both 1 mpg higher, but its combined rating is unchanged.)\n\nIn addition, there are two other powertrains available in the Forester: A version with the same four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission that’s rated 22/29/25 mpg, and one with a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that gets 23/28/25 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Forester’s standout attribute on the inside is its phenomenally good visibility. This is an SUV, so you ride higher than you would in a car, but the great view is also due to the fact that there’s a lot of glass. The main windows are large, and there are also small, sail-shaped windows by the side mirrors that help visibility. The rear window was so large, in fact, that I was startled at first by how much I could see.  It’s head-and-shoulders better in this regard than any competitor.\n\nThe Forester is also roomy. I’m 6-foot, 2-inches tall, and I wasn’t cramped for space either in the front or in the backseat. There’s one piece of trim by the driver’s right knee that I think could use some padding; when I brushed up against it, it didn’t feel great. The seats weren’t my favorites, either, as they offered little thigh support and are designed such that I felt I was perched on top of the seat rather than being supported by it. A bit of side bolstering or more seat contour would be welcome.\n\nStill, couple the Forester’s excellent visibility with the panoramic moonroof we had in our test car (it’s standard on all but the base, 2.5i model), and it’s hard to feel claustrophobic in this SUV.\n\nThe rest of the Forester’s interior isn’t a clear-cut winner. The materials aren’t bad, but they’re more functional than stylish. In this area, the Rogue is the segment’s clear winner. The CR-V ranks next and the CX-5 and Forester trail. A little more padding and less-plasticky trim would go a long way toward bringing the Forester up with the best in the market.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Forester does well in this area, with everything you need within easy reach when it comes to adjusting things such as the climate control system.\n\nWhere the Forester struggles is in its setup for adjusting a few of the power controls and electronics. For starters, the USB ports in the center storage console are hard to access: I felt like it was anatomically impossible to bend my wrist in the manner needed to connect my phone’s cord to the port.\n\nAlso, the touch-screen was too sensitive and would frequently jump to something other than what I wanted because I’d accidentally brushed it. The Forester is the only car I’ve been in over the past year where that’s happened.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Forester’s cargo area is quite large behind the backseat, and it expands to a very good size with the seat down. If there’s a nit to pick with the cargo area, it’s that the rear wheel wells intrude upon it, so carrying very wide things, such as a television, could prove problematic. On the whole, though, it handled everything I threw at it — a bicycle, groceries, Christmas shopping and gym gear — very well.\n\nUp front, there’s a nice, deep center console that — USB port location aside — offers good space for larger cellphones, gloves and sunglasses.\n\nSafety\nThe Subaru Forester is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus, meaning it scored the highest rating of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in all five of the agency’s crash tests, and that it earned an additional superior rating thanks to its optional forward collision prevention equipment.\n\nThe Forester is in good company; six other models in IIHS’ Small SUVs category share Top Safety Pick Plus status, including the CR-V and CX-5. The Rogue trails with a collision-prevention rating of basic. Three other direct competitors have a score of poor in the front small-overlap test.\n\nIn addition to the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, our test car came with Subaru’s optional EyeSight system that includes pre-collision automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Browse the Forester’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe beauty of today’s compact SUV market is its variety. Some models are fairly fun to drive (CX-5), some offer a pretty interior (Rogue), and others offer a comfortable ride with a blend of nice features (CR-V). When we tested them head-to-head, their scores reflected their varying strengths and weaknesses. In the case of the Forester, those weaknesses include an interior that’s more functional than fun (or nice), overboosted steering, mushy brakes and a choppy ride.\n\nThe Forester succeeds as a small SUV that offers standard all-wheel drive, a good cargo area and a roomy interior with fantastic visibility. It also ranks as the most utilitarian of its competitors, and that’s not a bad thing when discussing SUVs. Not every car needs to be as nice and pretty as your living room, especially if you’re the outdoorsy sort, live a little off the beaten path or just like to haul messy things around, such as pets. Nor does an SUV need to scorch the slalom course if all you’re after is the ability to get where you’re going in inclement weather.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "The first goal for Subaru with its all-new, fifth-generation Forester was not to screw it up. The five-seat compact SUV has loyal buyers, and the past generation doubled its predecessor’s sales.\n\nThe company came up with a 2019 Forester that’s literally new throughout, but doesn’t trumpet it. If you liked the fourth generation, you’ll like the new one better — you just might have trouble spotting it in a parking lot. The Forester’s defining characteristic remains practicality. The 2019 Forester is quieter and smoother and has higher-quality materials inside. The Subaru shot from being a laggard to finding a place among the leaders in multimedia technology, even on the base trim level. The automaker’s EyeSight safety tech with automatic braking is now standard on all models.\n\nThe Forester continues to offer Base, Premium, Limited and Touring trim levels. New for 2019 is a mid-level Sport trim with sportier details and a price between the Premium and Limited. I drove a Sport as well as a top-of-the-line Touring.\n\nSubtle New Look\n\nIf you were hoping for trendy, swoopy new styling, you’re out of luck. It’s not that the 2019 Forester doesn’t have a freshened look, but it’s a subtle change, with sharper side sculpting and more of a pinched waist, a bigger grille and a stronger face. It’s still small and tall, retaining its familiar upright profile with a low beltline and tall windows; the city-friendly footprint is only slightly longer and wider than the 2018.\n\nThe new Sport model adds a little unfamiliar attitude. It sports a black grille, black 18-inch wheels, and orange accents low on all four sides as well as up on the roof rails. The Touring, meanwhile, gets some substantial-looking chrome and new wheels for a classier look. All 2019s wear upscale automatic LED headlights.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nSubaru’s updated 2.5-liter horizontally opposed boxer engine now has direct injection and a higher, 12:1 compression ratio, which help gas mileage. The engine puts out 12 more horsepower, at 182 hp, and a bit more torque, at 176 pounds-feet. Also helping improve throttle response around town is a wider ratio spread for the standard continuously variable automatic transmission (the stick shift is gone). The improved low-speed response is noticeable and welcome, because also gone is the old Forester’s 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter engine — the fun option.\n\nWhile the boxer engine won’t break any records on on-ramps, it’s peppy enough for most Forester buyers — few of whom opted for the turbo anyway, Subaru says. The rating is competitive with other top-selling compact SUVs. Real-world performance from a stop and in passing is competitive, too, though with a second or two of lag off the line that seems inherent with CVTs. Compare competitor specifications here.\n\nThe Forester masks the CVT’s nature with artificial steps meant to mimic a conventional transmission under harder acceleration. That helps cut CVT-induced whine, though the non-turbo four-cylinder needs to be wound up noisily to reach its peak torque and horsepower. You can also take over the CVT with a seven-speed manual mode, including paddle shifters on the Sport and Touring trims. Foresters also offer Intelligent (i.e., normal) and Sport drive modes, the latter of which sharpens throttle response. The Sport trim substitutes a Sport Sharp mode that was a little more fun but still not aggressive.\n\nThe 2019 Forester powertrain also offers slightly better fuel economy, with EPA ratings of 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined — up 1 mpg versus the past generation for both the combined and highway estimates. Those numbers match or beat all-wheel-drive versions of current mileage leaders, including the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Mazda CX-5. Compare them here.\n\nBody roll on twisting roads is minimal, and body motion on uneven pavement or even washboard gravel roads is impressively controlled. The past generation showed similar capabilities but with a penalty in ride quality. Not so with the smooth-riding 2019: Steering is stable on center, feeling a little light coming off center, but the electric variable assist firms up predictably, with better response as you crank. It’s no sports coupe, but the new Forester is stable and confident, from freeway cruising to evasive maneuvers. It was particularly so on rutted gravel roads that probably should have been taken slower — and would have been in many Forester rivals.\n\nNot Afraid to Get Dirty\n\nWhile the Forester can’t rival some versions of the Jeep Cherokee for serious rock crawling, I’d go for it before other compact SUVs for snowy roads as well as on sand or mud. For starters, there are 8.7 inches of ground clearance and short overhangs. Every Forester has a genuinely competent torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system, too, rather than a light AWD setup. All but the base model also has Subaru’s X-Mode that can be engaged to automatically improve AWD performance in snow or dirt, as well as activate Hill Descent Control. Sport and higher models get a new version of X-Mode with a second Deep Snow/Mud setting that turns off the traction control to allow some necessary wheelspin when digging out.\n\nI checked out X-Mode and Hill Descent Control on a moderate off-road course in a muddy field. Both performed without a hiccup, with Hill Descent Control handling dirt grades to negative 27 degrees — enough to trigger the collision alert at the bottom.\n\nInterior Classier and More Comfortable\n\nForester interiors have been like sensible shoes: bland but practical and long-wearing. The 2019 Forester has a lot less to apologize for.\n\nThe updated dashboard is still logically arranged but looks more upscale. The trim is higher-quality, and the surfaces are mostly soft-touch down to elbow level even in the mid-range Sport and certainly in the top Touring, which now better lives up to its upscale aspirations. Even surfaces that were already soft now look and feel better. The vinyl-trimmed cloth interior of the Sport adds flair with its attractive orange brushed-metallic finish on the climate vents and console, plus orange contrast stitching. Meanwhile, the Touring’s top-level leather upholstery has a richer look and feel.\n\nIt’s still a Subaru, so the design remains eclectic and perhaps a little busy. Yet it works, and the Sport seems more upscale than a mid-level 2018. The seats and fancier dashboard and other trim in the Limited and Touring, while similarly busy, offer suitable luxury and additional features, such as the Touring’s new heated rear seats. They can hold their own with competitors’ top trims. The redesigned front seats better cradle your back and bottom, but still feel somewhat flat; I wanted more bolstering on the twisting and off-road portions of my test drive. Still, all the interiors give the impression they can handle wear and tear and will be easy to maintain — like sensible shoes.\n\nAdding to the overall classier feel of the cabin is the suppression of wind, tire, engine and road noise. Noise control in the Forester has leapt forward, as have other Subarus that have moved to the new platform. Only back-to-back testing would rank them, but the 2019 Forester is solidly in the mainstream with rivals in terms of noise levels and easy conversation with those in the backseat.\n\nAll Foresters except the base model include a large power moonroof that opens over the front seats and extends into the rear-seat area. Subaru calls it “panoramic,” which might be a stretch, but it is big and square, not just a little rectangle over the driver’s head.\n\nThe roomy, tall backseat of previous models — already a high point — got a bit roomier for 2019 thanks to the new platform’s 1.2-inch-longer wheelbase, which contributes to 1.4 inches more rear legroom. Rear access is improved, with doors that open nearly 90 degrees, along with very vertical door pillars. There’s no ducking required to get in, and there’s plenty of space at the floor to get your feet in and out with some measure of grace. I also give points to Subaru for minimizing the drop-off in materials quality in the rear, even in lower trim levels. All trims but the base also have center-console climate vents. People who regularly carry adults in the back or wrestle with child-safety seats will appreciate the backseat.\n\nThere’s competitive cabin storage for a compact SUV, with a bigger-for-2019 front-console device bin and an extra cubby in the space freed up by the new electronic parking brake. There are eight bottleholders or cupholders and ample door pockets, and the divided front seatback pockets make for more organized storage.\n\nTech Gets Up to Speed\n\nThe multimedia touchscreen is a decent 6.5-inch unit on the lower three trim levels, powered by Subaru’s latest Starlink system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. There’s a Wi-Fi hot spot on Premium and higher trims (subscription required). An 8-inch Starlink system is optional on the Sport and standard on the top two trim levels; it has all the base features and adds a higher-definition screen, voice control, hands-free text messaging, up-to-date graphics and an intuitive interface. Navigation is optional on the Limited and standard on the Touring. Nine-speaker Harman Kardon audio is an option on the Sport and Limited and standard on the Touring. I liked the upgraded stereo’s clean performance, and it helps that the Forester is now quiet enough to enjoy it.\n\nIn keeping with what seems to be the 2019 redesign strategy, the many tech improvements won’t startle Forester loyalists. You still have real knobs for volume and tuning, plus shortcut buttons for the radio, media, phone and apps. There’s even still an old-school CD slot. But the feel of the knobs and switches seems a little cheap.\n\nAlso familiar from the previous generation is a second, small information screen atop the dash. It’s not a bad place for information such as time and temperature, and I became addicted to the X-Mode graphics there, which display power distribution and angle in degrees as you crawl up or down hills. That screen also handles climate control information, even though the climate buttons and knobs are low on the dash, which is a little awkward.\n\nConnections and power for your devices are as plentiful in the Forester as they are in SUVs that brag a lot more about their tech savvy credentials. All models have a pair of 2.1-amp USB media ports (enough for tablets and large phones) at the front of the console, as well as 12-volt power outlets in the dash, center console bin and cargo area. Premium models and higher add a pair of 2.1-amp USB charging ports on the rear of the center console.\n\nAble to Handle a Load\n\nThe Forester already had substantial cargo space for a compact SUV, and the 2019’s maximum cargo capacity has grown to 76.1 cubic feet with the rear backrests folded. That’s only for the base model, though; the power moonroof on other trim levels cuts that to 70.9 cubic feet — still big. Space behind the backseat is an ample 35.4 cubic feet (33.0 with the moonroof), which is also on the high end among compact SUVs but not at the top, where you’ll get up to 37.6 cubic feet behind the second row in a Volkswagen Tiguan and 39.2 in a Honda CR-V.\n\nAs important for hauling is the fact that the new Forester has a much bigger, more squared-off liftgate opening that’s wider by 5.1 inches, ranging from 51.2 inches at most to 49.5 at the low liftover. The rear seat folds easily, with pull-up knobs on the 60/40-split, folding backrests. The Touring also has release levers in the cargo area. The new Forester’s load floor is flatter than the 2018 with the backrests folded, and the space between the wheel wells grew 1.1 inches, to 43.3 inches. A power liftgate is available or standard on the top thee trim levels, but there’s no hands-free opening available as there is on some competitors.\n\nKeeping an Eye on Safety, and You\n\nThe 2019 Forester doesn’t yet have crash-test ratings. When available, they’ll replace the 2018 results here.\n\nThe safety and driver-assist technology that’s now standard on all models keeps it a leader in this regard among compact SUVs. All trims have Subaru’s full EyeSight package, including a full-speed front collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist. Also standard is a trailer stability assist feature that uses selective braking. Optional on all but the base model and standard on the top two trims are blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. Also offered on Sport and above is reverse automatic braking up to 9 mph (standard on Touring).\n\nThe Touring also offers a first for a mainstream compact SUV: a camera that watches you. The new Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition watches for signs of driver fatigue or distraction and triggers an alert when necessary. It can also recognize up to five faces, then greet them with a chosen name and serve up their seat, mirror and some climate preferences.\n\nBeyond its fancy safety tech, the Forester retains an old-school safety feature: really impressive visibility. The 2019 Forester’s pillars are slim by today’s standards, the beltline is low and the windows are picture-window massive all around. The windshield pillars are pulled back toward the driver, and the side mirrors are down on the doors, giving you an extra triangle window in the lower corners. The result is minimal blind spots compared with most new SUVs.\n\nDriving Value Against Tough Competition\n\nThe base 2019 Subaru Forester starts at $25,270 (all prices include destination). That’s $560 more than a base 2018 when equipped with its then-optional CVT. The base 2019 Forester offers a lot of standard value, including the EyeSight package as well as all-wheel drive, a multimedia system with plenty of connectivity, and automatic climate control. It does come with plastic wheel covers (yuck!), but 17-inch alloy wheels are a $600 option.\n\nA key Forester selling point is that its base price with standard AWD, $25,270, is competitive with rivals’ front-wheel-drive versions. The other 2019 redesign, the Toyota RAV4, will start at $25,705 with FWD when it goes on sale in late 2018, and you’ll have to pony up $27,105 if you want to put down power to all four wheels. The 2019 Honda CR-V has not been priced as of this review, but a 2018 starts at $25,245, and adding AWD bumps that up to $26,645. A 2019 Nissan Rogue starts at $25,845 and jumps to $27,195 with AWD. Compare these vehicles and their features here. (Specs for the 2019 RAV4 are not yet available.)\n\nThe new Forester Sport middle child might be the new “value edition,” adding features like heated seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a better information display, as well as additional available options, at a starting price of $29,770. The Sport I drove had a $2,045 option package that added the 8-inch media system, upgraded audio, a power liftgate, blind spot and rear cross-traffic warning, and rear automatic braking. It tipped the scales at $31,815 — still a moderate price these days for a well-equipped compact SUV.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In the last couple of years mini-sport-utilities have established a solid niche in the market. But none of them — the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Kia Sportage or Suzuki Sidekick/Chevrolet Tracker –is a serious off-road vehicle. In fact, there isn’t much sport in any of these utility vehicles.\n\nSubaru is the latest automaker to check in with a small sport-utility that is missing vital ingredients. This time it’s a rugged suspension system and the commanding view of the road you are supposed to get in an SUV.\n\nThe Subaru Forester probably will sell well for the time being because, anything with all-wheel drive and a brawny visage is in vogue.\n\nIn its current form the Forester — which is based on the Impreza compact — is really just a small minivan — not that there’s anything wrong with that.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Forester comes with a horizontally opposed, 2.5-liter, double overhead cam four-cylinder engine. Horsepower is rated at 165 — best in class. Our test vehicle came with a four-speed automatic transmission that added $800 to the sticker price. A five-speed manual transmission is standard.\n\nAll Foresters are built with Subaru’s reliable all-wheel drive system. In normal driving, power is sent equally to the front and rear wheels. However, if the tires begin to slip, the system automatically will adjust the amount of power sent to the front or rear to maximize traction. In light off-road driving, the Forester dug in and grabbed the dirt well. Under full acceleration, the Forester’s tires didn’t lose traction, and the vehicle handled well.\n\nPerhaps cruising safely over dirt roads is where the Forester excels. It doesn’t ride higher than the average auto, so you won’t want to veer too far off the beaten path for fear that the Forester’s underpinnings could be damaged by deep holes, branches, logs and other debris.\n\nIn most instances, the transmission provided smooth shifts. But every now and then it bumped hard into gear when accelerating from a stop. I don’t know if this was an isolated mechanical fault in our test vehicle or just a trait of the all-wheel drive system. It happened inconsistently and didn’t feel as if anything was seriously wrong.\n\nThe Forester’s ride is smooth, quiet and sporty. The four-wheel independent suspension system — with MacPherson struts, coil springs and anti-roll bars — keeps the Forester on an even keel. It also does a credible job ironing out the rough spots in the road.\n\nHowever, the four-wheel disc brakes really let the vehicle down. You have to apply extra muscle to get the Forester to stop quickly. But the anti-lock system worked well. Because you have to press hard on the brake pedal to engage the system, the Forester does comes to a quick stop in an emergency.\n\nFor a small vehicle, the Forester’s maneuverability is hampered slightly by its wide 38.3-foot turning radius. But the power rack-and-pinion steering system offers a crisp, sporty feel.\n\nAl l in all, the Forester is an easy vehicle to drive. It’s peppy and handles well. With stronger brakes and a better turning radius, it could be tops in its class.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nSubaru has come along way in ridding its vehicles of the cheap feeling they used to have. The company has done this by upgrading the quality of the materials it uses on such things as upholstery, plastic trim and carpet. Even the buttons, switches and controls have a solid feel.\n\nThere’s no question that Subaru did a decent job making the Forester’s seats comfortable and versatile and filling the vehicle with power accessories. All it needed, really, were remote-controlled door locks.\n\nBut it is a small vehicle. And unlike that Blazer or Explorer, the Forester won’t hold a full-size bicycle inside. Instead, you have to strap it to the roof rack or buy a bumper-mounted bicycle carrier.\n\nVisibility is excellent, front and rear and from side to side. There’s a nifty little gauge in the c nter of the dash that shows which direction the vehicle is headed as well as the altitude and barometric pressure. But this instrument, along with fender flares, fog lights and fat tires, don’t make the Forester a sport-utility vehicle.\n\nLooking at the whole picture, the Forester S model we tested is no great value. You could wheel home a fairly nice Chevrolet Blazer or Ford Explorer — true sport-utilities– for roughly the same money as our test vehicle.\n\nWhy pay a premium for a smaller vehicle that offers less power, less room and less standard equipment?\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1998 Subaru Forester Base price: $22,195. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes and side-impact protection. Price as tested: $24,727. EPA rating: 21 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The car-based Subaru’s Forester is basically a small minivan, not a true sport-utility. It handles well, delivers good performance and has a lot of equipment. But it is not a serious off-road vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Subaru Forester compact SUV still impresses with a blend of comfort, utility and practicality — once you get accustomed to its interior controls. \n\nVersus the competition: The Forester’s impressive outward visibility is unmatched in its class, and its ride comfort is among the best. The SUV’s standard advanced safety features are compelling, but its multimedia technology looks dated. \n\nWhen we last tested the Subaru Forester, we compared it to six of its rivals in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge, where it earned a strong second-place finish. That model had just been redesigned, and since then it’s added more standard safety features, including lane-centering steering for 2020 and adaptive LED headlights with high-beam assist for 2021.\n\nThe 2021 Forester starts at $25,845 (including a $1,050 destination charge), but our test vehicle was a mid-level Sport trim with a starting price of $30,445. A $1,645 package that added an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, a Harman Kardon premium stereo, a power liftgate and reverse automatic braking increased the as-tested price to $32,090.\n\nPleasant to Drive\n\nIn a class that on the whole offers relatively firm ride quality, the Forester’s comfort-oriented suspension tuning is a welcome change. On rougher roads where I’ve experienced a bumpy ride in other small SUVs, the Forester was remarkably smooth by comparison; the impacts I did feel weren’t harsh in the slightest. Despite its name, the Sport trim doesn’t have firmer suspension tuning than other Foresters, but it does come with 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires (17-inch wheels and tires are standard).\n\nThe Forester has standard all-wheel drive and is powered by a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that works with a continuously variable automatic transmission. It’s a well-tuned drivetrain that doesn’t suffer from excessive engine droning, like some CVT-equipped vehicles do, and acceleration from a stop is smooth and predictable. On the highway, the CVT responds quickly when you floor the gas pedal, but resulting acceleration is modest. There’s also noticeable wind and road noise at highway speeds. \n\nEPA-estimated gas mileage for all Forester trim levels is 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined. Among all-wheel-drive competitors, the 2021 Nissan Rogue and 2021 Honda CR-V are also rated 29 mpg combined, while the 2021 Toyota RAV4 is rated up to 30 mpg combined. The 2021 Volkswagen Tiguan’s 24 mpg combined rating trails the group. \n\nThe Forester’s 8.7 inches of ground clearance is nearly as much as some off-road-oriented SUVs — like the Toyota 4Runner, which has 9.6 inches of clearance in four-wheel-drive form — but the Forester handles more like a low-slung car than an SUV. It feels planted and stable in sweeping turns, and there isn’t excessive body roll. Steering precision is good, but feedback is nonexistent. \n\nComfortable, Airy Interior\n\nThe Forester’s combination of thin roof pillars, large windows and upright profile result in class-leading outward visibility. It’s all the more refreshing because natural visibility has mostly gotten worse in new cars in recent years. Besides making it easy to see what’s around you, the Forester’s design — and the single-pane panoramic moonroof that’s standard in all trims but the base model — makes the cabin feel airy. One unusual aspect of the cabin, however, is the way the driver-side front roof pillar reflects painted road markings, like the dotted lines on a highway. It’s a little distracting once you notice it. \n\nThe Forester’s front bucket seats are comfortable, and the side bolsters are big enough to hold you in place in corners. Premium and Sport trim levels have fabric upholstery and heated front seats, while the Limited trim adds leather-trimmed seats. Top-of-the-line Touring models have heated rear seats, too.\n\nThe 60/40-split rear bench seat is equally comfortable, with plenty of legroom for taller adults. The seat doesn’t slide, but Premium and higher trims have a reclining backrest.\n\nWhile the Forester’s cabin is roomy and comfortable, it doesn’t have a lot of space for odds and ends: The storage bin under the front center armrest is small, and there’s just a small cubby at the base of the dashboard. The cubby also holds USB ports, but the space isn’t big enough for some smartphones.\n\nMultimedia Tech a Step Behind\n\nThe kind of large information screens first seen in luxury cars are now available in mainstream compact SUVs like the Tiguan and Rogue, but the Forester’s screens look dated in comparison. The Subaru doesn’t offer a digital instrument panel, either, as those SUVs do. The Forester does, however, have expected connectivity features, like standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.\n\nThere are a lot of controls for drivers to decipher, and it’s not immediately apparent which buttons control which systems. The information screen atop the dashboard, for instance, is controlled by buttons on the steering wheel. While the presence of actual buttons and switches, not touch-sensitive controls, is welcome, they could be better arranged.\n\nCrash Tests and Advanced Safety Features\n\nThe 2021 Subaru Forester received top marks in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash-testing, scoring good ratings in all tests. The standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems — part of the Forester’s EyeSight driver-assist technology bundle — were deemed superior, the highest rating possible, while the newly standard LED headlights also earned a good rating.\n\nThe Forester’s standard adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering systems work well. Its lane-centering feature, however, seemed to favor the right side of the lane, which would put the SUV closer to traffic when not in the rightmost lane. The lights on the side mirrors for the optional blind spot warning system are easy to see in your peripheral vision.\n\nCargo Space\n\nThe Forester’s backseat folds flat with the cargo floor when more luggage space is needed, and the Touring trim adds a one-touch folding feature. According to Cars.com cargo area measurements, there’s 18.17 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat. That’s more than the 2021 Mazda CX-5 (17.91 cubic feet), 2021 Rogue (17.12) and 2021 Ford Bronco Sport (13.9), but less than hybrid versions of the 2021 RAV4 (20.69) and 2021 CR-V (19.61) we’ve measured.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe compact SUV class is extremely competitive, with new models arriving on a regular basis. Since our last comparison test, the Rogue has been redesigned for 2021, the 2022 Hyundai Tucson is redesigned, and an updated 2022 Tiguan will arrive later in the year. \n\nWhile the Forester isn’t the newest SUV in the class, its many standard active safety features and standard all-wheel drive make it a value-packed option that’s worth consideration if you’re shopping for a small SUV.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The question for Subaru in creating an all-new Forester was how not to fumble a model that has famously loyal buyers (some on their second or third). The current generation has doubled its predecessor’s sales and now accounts for more than 1 in 4 Subarus sold in the U.S., second only to the Outback, though not by much.\n\nRelated: Subaru Ascent Vs. Volkswagen Atlas: The Family (SUV) Feud Begins\n\nThe answer is a fifth-generation Forester five-seat compact SUV that’s literally new throughout but does not trumpet it. If you liked the fourth generation, you’ll like this one better, but you might have trouble spotting it in the parking lot. It’s not that it doesn’t have a fresh look, with sharper side sculpting and a pinched waist, bigger grille and stronger face. But it’s still small and tall, retaining the signature low beltline and tall windows. The still city-friendly footprint is just slightly longer and wider.\n\nI tested the new Forester at a Subaru event on rural highways, gravel forest roads and a short off-road course near the mountain town of Asheville, N.C. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events.) I devoted most of my time to the new Sport model. The 2019 Foresters will be at dealers nationwide on Oct. 1.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe updated 2.5-liter Subaru boxer engine now has direct injection and a higher 12:1 compression ratio, which help gas mileage, and it puts out 12 more horsepower at 182 hp and a couple of more pounds-feet of torque at 176. Also helping to improve throttle response around town is a 10 percent wider ratio spread for the standard continuously variable automatic transmission (the stick shift is discontinued). The improved low-speed response is noticeable, and any help is welcome because also gone is the 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter engine — the fun option.\n\nWhile the standard (and now only) engine won’t break any records on the on-ramp, it is peppy enough for most Forester buyers, few of whom opted for the turbo anyway, according to Subaru. The rating is competitive with other top-selling compact SUVs. Real-world performance from a stop or in passing is competitive, too, though the Honda CR-V’s turbo 1.5-liter’s low-end torque feels stronger from a stop. Compare competitor specifications here.\n\nThe Forester masks the continuously variable nature of its CVT with seven artificial steps that mimic a conventional transmission under harder acceleration. It helps cut CVT-induced noise, though the non-turbo four-cylinder needs to be wound up to reach its torque and horsepower peaks. You also can take over the CVT steps with a manual-shifting mode (including steering-wheel paddle shifters on the Sport trim level). This aspect offered welcome control and engine braking on mountain roads and twisty unpaved tracks.\n\nForesters also offer Intelligent (i.e., Normal) and Sport drive modes, the latter of which sharpens throttle response. The Sport trim substitutes a Sport Sharp mode that was a little more fun but not aggressive.\n\nThe 2019 Forester powertrain also offers slightly better fuel economy, with EPA ratings of 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined, up 1 mpg each for combined and highway estimates. That matches or beats all-wheel-drive versions of current mileage leaders such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Mazda CX-5. Compare them here. The redesigned 2019 Toyota RAV4 has not yet been rated.\n\nBoth handling and ride benefit from the significantly stiffer new Subaru Global Platform that now underpins the latest Impreza sedan and the Crosstrek and new Ascent SUVs. Body roll on twisting highways was minimal. The past generation showed similar cornering, but with a penalty in ride quality; not so with the 2019, which now also can compete in ride smoothness. Body motion on uneven pavement or even washboard gravel roads was controlled, and steering is stable on center. It initially felt a little light coming off center, but the electric variable assist firms up nicely and predictably, delivering better response as you turn. It’s no sports coupe, but the Forester was comfortable as well as impressively stable and confident, from freeway cruising to evasive maneuvers and rutted gravel roads that probably should have been taken slower — and would have been in many Forester rivals.\n\nA fuel-saving automatic engine stop-start system now is standard. You can turn it off, but you have to do so each time you restart the car. The system is relatively unobtrusive, however, and also is set up to where the engine restarts with a tug of the steering wheel, so you’re not left without steering until you lift off the brake.\n\nNot Afraid to Get Dirty\n\nWhile the Forester can’t rival some versions of the Jeep Cherokee for serious rock crawling, I’d grab its keys before other compact SUVs for snowy roads, as well as for driving off the pavement in sand or mud.\n\nFor starters, there are Subaru’s 8.7 inches of ground clearance and its short overhangs. And every Forester also has AWD that’s a genuinely competent torque-vectoring system, not a light AWD setup. All but the base trim level also have Subaru’s X-Mode technology that can be engaged to automatically adjust for AWD performance in snow or dirt, as well as to activate Hill Descent Control. The Sport and above models get a new-for-2019 version of X-Mode with a second Deep Snow/Mud setting that turns off the traction control to allow some necessary wheelspin when digging out of, say, a snow bank.\n\n2019 Subaru Forester | Cars.com photo by Fed Meier\n\nI was able briefly to check out the X-Mode and Hill Descent Control on an off-road course in a muddy field. Both performed without a hiccup, with the Hill Descent Control handling dirt grades to negative 27 degrees, enough to trigger the collision alert at the bottom of the hill.\n\nInterior More Comfortable and a Classy Leap Forward\n\nI have equated the previous Forester’s interior design to sensible shoes: bland but practical and long-wearing. The 2019 Forester has a lot less to apologize for.\n\nThe updated dashboard still is logically arranged but now looks more upscale and less busy. The trim all around is higher in quality, and the surfaces are mostly soft-touch down to elbow level all around the car even in the mid-range Sport and Premium trims. Even surfaces that were soft before now are plusher with materials that have a better look and feel. The vinyl-trimmed cloth interior of the Sport model also adds some sportier flair with its attractive orange brushed-metallic finish on the climate vents and console, and orange contrast stitching.\n\nIt’s still a Subaru, so the design remains eclectic and, to my eye, a little busy. On the Sport’s front doors alone, I counted six different textures, patterns and shades of gray not counting the orange stitching, controls or speakers. Yet it somehow worked and seemed more upscale than a mid-level 2018. And the leather seats and fancier dashboard and other trim in the Limited and Touring, while similarly busy, now have a luxury look and feel and additional features, such as the Touring’s new heated rear seats, that can hold their own with competitors’ top trims. Even so, all the interiors still gave the impression that they could handle wear and tear and be easy to maintain like sensible shoes.\n\nSubaru officials provided some fancy heat-map images to show how the redesigned front seats better cradle your back and bottom. A long day of driving in the Sport’s cloth-upholstered seats, including on some rough roads, proved the images weren’t Photoshopped. The seats still are somewhat flat, however; I wanted more bolstering to hold me in place on the twisting and off-road portions of the test drive. I also sampled the leather seats in the higher trim levels and they were cushier, but similarly supportive and a bit flat for my taste.\n\nAdding to the overall classier feel inside is that wind, tire, engine and road noise suppression makes a similar leap forward as in other Subarus that have moved to the new platform. Only back-to-back testing would rank them, but the 2019 Forester moves solidly into the mainstream for noise with other compact SUVs and can challenge the leaders, such as the CR-V, for easy conversation with passengers in the backseat.\n\nAll Foresters except the base model also include a large power moonroof that opens over the front seats and extends into the rear-seat area. Subaru calls it “panoramic,” which might be a stretch — there is no additional fixed panel over the rear — but it is big and square, not just a little rectangle over your head. And it has a pull, not power, shade that I think is a plus for eliminating a potential reliability problem.\n\n2019 Subaru Forester | Cars.com photo by Fed Meier\n\nThe roomy and tall backseat of previous models, already a high point versus the competition, got roomier for 2019 thanks to the new platform’s 1.2-inch-longer wheelbase that contributes 1.4 inches more in rear legroom. I give points to Subaru for minimizing the drop-off in materials quality in the rear, even in lower trim levels. The only really obvious difference in the Sport was a harder surface on the rear window sills versus the soft touch in the front. All levels but the base also have center console climate vents and a pair of USB ports for the backseat.\n\nRear access is improved with large doors that open to near 90 degrees and very vertical door pillars, no ducking to get in. There is plenty of space at the floor to get your feet in and out with some measure of grace. People who regularly carry adults in the back or wrestle with child safety seats will appreciate the backseat details.\n\nThere’s competitive cabin storage for a compact SUV, with a bigger-for-2019 front console device bin and extra cubby, all using space freed up by the new electronic parking brake. There are eight bottle or cupholders, door pockets and a nice added detail is front seatback pockets that are divided help organize storage.\n\nAll Foresters have automatic climate control (single- or dual-zone), and it can be set to prioritize maximum output, minimal noise or higher gas mileage.\n\nPracticality Over All\n\nThe Forester’s defining characteristic remains its practicality. Subaru spent its makeover money in important but less flashy ways, making the 2019 Forester more comfortable, quieter and smoother. It improved the quality of cabin materials. It made EyeSight driver assistance tech and automatic braking standard on all models. And it came from behind with multimedia technology that’s very competitive even on the base model. We’ll delve further into these areas, cargo space and more in a coming full review.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "While others develop sport-utes built off cars, Subaru has a pair of such hybrids in showrooms, the compact Outback built off the Legacy wagon and the subcompact Forester built off the Impreza wagon.\n\nWe tested the ’99 Forester, fairly attractive and certainly very practical in terms of offering all-wheel-drive for all-season motoring.\n\nCute and cuddly, but Forester has two faults that need to be addressed as more rivals get into the small sport-ute market and consumers can be more selective.\n\nForester is a tad narrow and confining. And whoever designed the seats should be told that foam and cloth make for a more enjoyable ride than granite.\n\nStandard features include dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, 16-inch tires and a single overhead cam version of the old dual overhead cam 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, which has the same 165 h.p. but boasts more low-end torque for quicker off-the-line response.\n\nThe 4-cylinder is swift yet delivers 21 miles per gallon city/26 m.p.g. highway mileage with optional 4-speed automatic.\n\nOther noteworthy items include a rubber cargo-hold tray for carrying wet or soiled items, huge outside mirrors for optimum side-and-rear visibility, huge windshield for optimum down-the-road visibility, a hatchlid handle to help pull it down, folding rear seats to expand cargo capacity, covered mini bins in each door armrest to store items and a handy covered compartment in the dash top for storage.\n\nAn eyeglass holder is in the overhead console. If you use the radio a lot with its teeny-tiny control buttons, you’ll need glasses.\n\nThe Forester S starts at $22,495. Air conditioning, power windows/locks/heated mirrors and cruise control are standard. Options included 4-speed automatic at $800; keyless entry at $225; and a premium sound system upgrade with CD player at $1,025. With a $495 freight charge, the test vehicle topped $24,000.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSubaru invented the concept of car-based hybrid SUVs with the Legacy Outback, a station wagon tricked out to look like a sport ute. The Forester is a bigger step in the same direction. Using the platform for the 4WD Impreza station wagon, Subaru added a taller, wider, longer body with SUV styling attributes and more ground clearance than a Ford Explorer, and  presto  another sport utility vehicle is born.\n\nThough it resembles truck-based SUVs, the Forester is classified as a car under government safety standards. The big changes for 2000 are that cruise control is standard on the base L model and all Subarus now come with free roadside assistance for three years.\n\nInterior\nGiving the Forester 7.5 inches of ground clearance helps make it feel like a full-fledged SUV behind the wheel because the driver sits taller in the saddle than in a car. Forester holds five people, and the split rear seat folds to create nearly 65 cubic feet of cargo room. The rear seatback also reclines, which is an unusual touch.\n\nExterior\nStandard fog lights, two-tone paint and a roof rack give Forester overt SUV styling cues. Want an even more aggressive look? Subaru dealers can install protective underbody bars, a grille brush guard and a differential protector. Accessories also are available for hauling bikes, skis and kayaks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubaru uses horizontally opposed engines in which cylinders are arranged opposite each other instead of in line or a V configuration. Forester has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 165 horsepower, which Subaru brags is more than rivals such as the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. The standard 4WD system is permanently engaged and apportions power among the four wheels as needed for optimal traction. Subaru says 4WD and 7.5 inches of ground clearance give the Forester true go-anywhere capability.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "I thought I had a six.\n\nIt felt like it, drove like it, made me smile. But when I popped the hood of the 2001 Subaru Forester S AWD, there it was &#151; the workhorse horizontally opposed, 165-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine routinely used in the Subaru Legacy Outback wagon. I’d been primed for a six-cylinder version because of the hype over Subaru’s soon-to-arrive H6-3.0 power plant &#151; a 3-liter engine with horizontally opposed cylinder banks designed to develop 212 horsepower at 6,000 rpm.\n\nBecause that engine is scheduled for the 2001 Outback wagon, I thought Subaru might drop it into the Forester, too. After all, the two vehicles are thematically similar. They are station wagons designed to look like sport-utility vehicles. They share many parts and are distinguished primarily by styling cues.\n\nI laughed upon finding that the tested Forester was powered by four cylinders, because it actually felt like a six as long as I thought it was a six, and it felt like a six after I realized it was a four, too.\n\nMany four-cylinder vehicles are anemic. Their engines whine at highway speeds, as if they are being forced to do something they don’t want to do. They move slowly from “stop” and never seem to get up the gumption to “go.” There was none of that in the Forester S, Subaru’s upscale Forester.\n\nThe vehicle moved with authority, if not alacrity. It didn’t zoom from stop. At zero to 60 mph in 9.1 seconds, it’s no racer. But it’s not supposed to race, especially in the urban and suburban neighborhoods where it spends most of its time.\n\nBesides, it does everything any reasonable driver could expect it to do on the highway. It runs smoothly at top speeds, maneuvers nicely through traffic and brakes well (60 mph to zero in 134 feet).\n\nThere is very little body roll in the Forester. Credit here goes to the Forester S suspension, overall geometry and its grippy, 16-inch, Yokohama Geolander H/T tires.\n\nThough the Forester S has a tall rear, it also has a car-like low center of gravity. Its four-wheel independent suspension system, though cobbled together from Subaru Legacy and Impreza parts, is one of the best in the business. It tracks through curves as nicely as some expensively engineered passenger sedans.\n\nVery little has been done to the styling of the 2001 Forester. People who care to look closely can see slight alterations in the front and rear fascias, changes that, this time, elevate the station-wagon look over that of an SUV wanna-be.\n\nThe Forester S’s cloth-bound interior is classic Subaru &#151; Kmart verging on J.C. Penney, which is perfectly fine with me. It’s reliable stuff that looks okay. If you’re into image for the sake of image, buy something else that probably won’t last as long.\n\nI like the Forester S &#151; love it, in fact. It makes sense. Its 165 horses are more than enough to move five adults and their cargo quickly and safely. Construction quality is excellent, comparable to anything from Toyota or Honda. And it comes with one of the best, least-intrusive all-wheel-drive systems in the business.\n\nHeck, all-wheel drive is to Subaru what two-wheel drive is to everyone else. In the Forester S, as in all Subaru models, drive power automatically moves from slipping to gripping wheels so smoothly that neither the driver nor passengers know that it’s happening. All they know is that the vehicle continues moving through snow and rain with no discernible slips or slides.\n\nWhich brings me back to this six-cylinder thing: I’m sure that the H6-3.0 engine is a hoot, and I look forward to driving Legacy Outbacks or Foresters so equipped. In the interim, I’ll just enjoy hooting around with four good cylinders, which is about all I really need anyway.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\n2001 Subaru Forester S AWD Complaint: Subaru needs to install pneumatic hinges under the Forester’s heavy engine h ood, which cur rently is supported by a single steel rod when opened. Anyone unfortunate enough to dislodge that rod while the hood is up could wind up with a very big headache, a broken arm or worse.\n\nPraise: Excellent overall quality and presentation. It’s the perfect family commuter/hauler. It’ll do well on long trips, too.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Friendly. Makes you think that the person behind its wheel is a nice, decent sort.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and handling. Good acceleration. Solid overall road performance.\n\nCapacities: Carries five passengers with all seats up. It can carry up to 63 cubic feet of cargo with 60/40 split rear seats down. Trailer capacity is 2,000 pounds. The fuel tank holds 15.9 gallons; regular unleaded gasoline is fine.\n\nMileage: Combined city-highway in the test vehicle was 23 mpg.\n\nSafety: Lower rollover propensity than most SUVs, primarily because it’s not a real SUV, which means you should keep it on road more than off.\n\nPrice: Base price on the test car is $22,895. Dealer invoice is $20,776. Price as tested is $25,390, including $2,000 in options and a $495 destination charge. This price is subject to change. It does not include taxes and fees.\n\nPurse-strings note: Control the lust for options. That’ll make this one an excellent value. Compare with Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Santa Fe, Nissan Xterra.",

      "expert_review": "When I first plop down in the driver’s seat of the 2006 Subaru Forester, I mistakenly think, “this looks like a pretty basic car,” until I look up. Spying the magnificently expansive moonroof, which spans the length of the front and back rows, I predict that driving this car with the pint-sized gang should be fun.\n\nRight, I am! Viewing the golden leaf colors of fall in the foothills is a complete hit. All eyes are turned to the sky, with the aspen leaves dancing in the gentle fall breeze. My children become delirious with joy when spotting an airplane traveling overhead. Talk about real and simple entertainment. I wonder what it would take to have one of these moonroofs put into my own car.\n\nInitially, I think that storage space is limited in the Forester. One after another, I slowly discover all of the clever little nooks placed throughout the vehicle. The compact center console includes a small recessed shelf, which I can open to make use of an additional, albeit small, compartment including a power outlet. I can flip back the center console and expose two cupholders that are very convenient for my 4-year-old to use. The back passengers also have access to two additional cupholders, but since they are lower to the ground, I find the flip tray option to be more convenient. For my caffeine-laden drink, the two cupholders in the front keep me happy, and for anyone counting, that brings the total number of cupholders to a whopping six. Not bad for a small SUV!\n\nThe unique compartment in the dash gets me all excited, since the large cover makes me think it will store a book neatly. The opening is actually much smaller than the cover, but it still houses CDs perfectly, and I am thrilled about the functional use of space, nonetheless.\n\nUp above, I take note of two overhead storage compartments for sunglasses, and a visor that makes organization easy. A vertical cloth band (which can also hold bills, letters, etc.) allows me to easily grasp and flip open the visor to expose one pen insert and two card inserts, ideal for that ever-expiring insurance card.\n\nAdditionally, there are driver/passenger side mesh pockets, a passenger side mesh nook near the front center of the car (perfect for an extra set of keys), a glove box, one mesh magazine (or coloring book) holder behind the passenger seat, and five small compartments in the cargo area (one of which also includes a power outlet).\n\nThe cargo space boasts four shopping bag hooks, two handles (which could be used to clip light items to), and a tailgate grip handle. The highlight, however, is the plastic insert that protects the flooring. This is definitely one of my favorite features and I would like to add this to my wish list for any mom-friendly vehicle. Say goodbye to crumpled blankets, plastic tarps and stained cargo carpeting.\n\nI load my obnoxiously muddy stroller from a pumpkin patch outing into the back without a care. Later in the day, I remove the plastic insert, douse it with the garden hose, and “voila” … brand, spanking new again. Now, if only I could say the same for my not so pretty leather flats, which have been transformed into mud stilettos.\n\nWhen desperately trying to install a third child car seat in the back, I breathe a sigh of relief knowing that my son’s fall break means no carpooling. It is all but impossible. Very possible and easy to get to, however, are the Latch connectors. Even though I do not recommend this seating configuration (nor does Subaru, as the back is always the safest place for children), a forward-facing child car seat could be installed in the front in a pinch, as the front passenger side airbag is activated only when a certain weight level is reached.\n\nDriving this manual makes me wish for an automatic transmission. The clutch is bothersome to depress, but does supplement my Pilates work-out nicely. I also have to give that extra bit of TLC to shift into second gear smoothly; otherwise the car bucks and jerks.\n\nI love surprises and this car continuously surprises me. I haven’t even mentioned the simple to use Weather Broadcast button, or the cushy tushy heaters in the front. How about Subaru’s standard All Wheel Drive feature? All of this at an affordable price!\n\n*For more information on the Subaru Forester and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness is an off-road-themed trim level of the easy-to-recommend Forester, bringing increased off-road and towing capabilities.\n\nVersus the competition: Fortified with more than just stickers and plastic fenders, the Forester Wilderness is more suited to its purpose than most off-road-themed compact SUVs.\n\nThe Subaru Forester is a perennial Cars.com favorite: It’s finished on the podium in our past two compact SUV tests, placing second in 2019 and third in 2021. For 2022, the standout change for the Forester is a new Wilderness trim level, which takes a small SUV with impressive ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive and turns it up a notch, making what Subaru says is the most trail-capable Forester yet.\n\nThree main components are changed on the Wilderness to create its extra capability: tires, suspension and gearing. The Forester Wilderness ends up with double the towing capacity of other trims: 3,000 pounds versus 1,500 pounds. A thorough off-road test will come later — I drove our test Wilderness mostly on-road, with just some light gravel and dirt-road driving for this review — but the Wilderness treatment (including Subaru’s Outback Wilderness) doesn’t make way for hardcore off-roading. It does, however, do more to make these Subarus off-road-ready than many off-road-themed crossovers.\n\nRelated: 2022 Subaru Outback Wilderness First Drive: More of What Outback Owners Love\n\nThe Wilderness is the most significantly changed version of the Forester for 2022; other trims have minor changes that wouldn’t alter — for better or worse — where the 2022 Subaru Forester placed in our 2021 Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nTires\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Wilderness’ standard tires are meaty 17-inch Yokohama Geolandar A/T (all-terrain) tires, sized the same as the Forester Premium’s street-oriented 17-inch tires (225/60R17). The Geolandar A/Ts are more off-road-oriented tires, with knobbier tread blocks, that wouldn’t look out of place on a Jeep Wrangler.\n\nFor how aggressive they look, though, they don’t increase road noise much. The Geolandar A/T G015 is designed to be a daily-driven all-terrain tire; it’s not a max-effort off-road tire. You can feel the tires’ squirminess on-road versus an ordinary passenger-car street tire, but that’s a typical trade-off for the additional capability they offer. Two more attributes that may be associated with the tires are slightly harsher impacts versus the Forester’s standard tires and, on the plus side, confident roadholding on loose gravel and dirt roads.\n\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nA surprise-and-delight feature of the Wilderness is that there’s a matching full-size spare tire and wheel, which you’d appreciate if you got a puncture off the beaten path and needed this tire’s capability to get back to a main road.\n\nSuspension\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Wilderness’ wheels and tires are attached to a lifted suspension that gets its height via longer springs and shock absorbers. Ground clearance is up half an inch — to 9.2 inches from 8.7 inches — which improves approach, departure and breakover angles. The suspension has been tuned to the new ride height, and it’s buttery smooth on-road — though with some slightly harsher impacts than you’d feel in a regular Forester.\n\nOn loose dirt and gravel-covered roads, the tires and suspension absorb imperfections at high speeds without upsetting the cabin. That’s in stark contrast to the Ford Bronco Sport Badlands’ suspension, which is also off-road-oriented but feels like it’s made of bricks compared with the pillowy nature of the Forester’s ride. The Bronco Sport has its own advantages, though, like a rip-roaring 250-horsepower engine and torque-vectoring rear axle.\n\nGearing\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor now, we’ve spent more time in the Wilderness on-road, where the effect of its shorter final drive ratio (4.11:1 versus 3.70:1 in other Foresters) is most notable in improving the Forester’s snappiness and accelerator response. The Wilderness gets up and goes with more vigor than an ordinary Forester, making passing more confidence-inspiring thanks to quicker reactions while at speed. According to Subaru spokesman Charles Ballard, the gearing change was made in the continuously variable automatic transmission through an updated pulley ratio, and the rear axle ratio was optimized to work with it.\n\nThe new gearing makes the most of the Forester’s only engine, a 182-hp, 2.5-liter flat-four-cylinder, which in our testing scooted the Wilderness from 0-60 mph faster than the standard Forester: The Wilderness accelerated to 60 mph in 8.6 seconds, versus the 9.57 seconds a Forester Touring took.\n\nOn the downside, the Forester’s highway mpg rating took a hard hit from the gearing change, dropping an EPA-estimated 5 mpg, from 33 mpg to 28. The combined rating drops 3 mpg, from 29 mpg to 26, while the city rating is least affected, dropping only 1 mpg (26 mpg to 25). The Wilderness’ 26 mpg combined rating does, however, still compare favorably with other top compact SUV off-road trims: The Ford Bronco Sport Badlands is rated 23 mpg combined, and the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk has a 21 mpg rating. The Wilderness does come in slightly lower than the Toyota RAV4 TRD Offroad’s 28 mpg rating.\n\nHigher Towing Capacity\n\nThe Forester Wilderness’ towing capacity has doubled to 3,000 pounds versus the standard Forester’s rating, and the Wilderness’ goods are to thank. An external transmission oil cooler helps keep the transmission’s fluid temperatures cool while working, and its higher numeric gear ratios deliver more wheel torque to make the car easier to move under load. (Trucks often include numerically higher gear ratios and transmission coolers in optional towing packages to increase towing capacity.) Ballard said a reinforced transfer case and more powerful radiator fan (up from 120 to 160 watts) also help increase the tow rating. The Forester Wilderness’ towing capacity is notable but not class-leading; other compact SUVs are rated to tow more than 3,000 pounds.\n\nCompact SUVs With High Towing Capacity\nJeep Cherokee: 4,000 pounds with 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and Trailer Tow Package, 4,500 pounds with 3.2-liter V-6 and Trailer Tow Package\nFord Escape: 3,500 pounds with towing package and optional engine in Titanium and SEL trims\nToyota RAV4: 3,500 pounds with Adventure and TRD Offroad trims\nIs the Wilderness Worth It?\n\nWhile I didn’t experience the Forester Wilderness’ peak off-road capabilities, I liked it even on pavement compared with other Forester trim levels. The new gearing does a lot for accelerator response, while the suspension and new tires make quick work of bad roads. On the downside, fuel economy is hit pretty hard, and there are quirks in all Foresters that can’t be addressed without a redesign — like poor cabin storage, an awkward information display atop the dashboard and excessive wind noise. As a whole, though, even with those quirks you can’t go wrong with a Forester, and this off-road package is more than a few stickers. It’s certainly a big enough change to consider its $34,000 asking price if you’re in need of more off-road or towing capability from your Forester.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Subaru Forester Review: Worthy Contender\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Subaru Forester?\n2022 Subaru Forester: Gone Wild\n2022 Subaru Outback Wilderness Price Starts Just Over $38,000\n2022 Subaru Outback Wilderness: 4 Things to Know About the Most Capable Outback\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2025 Subaru Forester sticks to its predecessor’s successful script as an adventure-ready compact SUV with standard all-wheel drive and better-than-average off-road capability while gaining new tech and convenience features and better all-around refinement.\n\nVersus the competition: The Forester stands out in the crowded compact SUV class by virtue of its boxy, space-efficient profile and its great-outdoors-focused design philosophy. It stacks up well against the Ford Bronco Sport, Jeep Compass, and Toyota RAV4’s Adventure and TRD Off-Road trim levels.\n\nSubaru’s plucky Forester compact SUV is perennially one of the brand’s bestselling vehicles, usually running neck and neck with the smaller Crosstrek and larger Outback in annual sales. The Forester has carved out an enviable position in a highly competitive class by offering excellent cabin space and rough-terrain capability in a sensibly sized package, topped off with Subaru’s signature outdoorsy image.\n\nRelated: 2025 Subaru Forester Up Close: No Big Changes, Just Better\n\nPreviously redesigned for the 2019 model year, the Forester gets another ground-up redo for 2025 to kick off the model’s sixth generation. The expected styling updates and new features are part of the redesign, as are notable improvements in quietness and refinement, but the Forester’s likable personality carries over intact. I drove the 2025 Forester at its press preview event in western Montana, where I sampled its improvements on both paved roads and rutted, steep and occasionally snowy gravel roads. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated Video:\n\nStaying the Course\n\nIn designing the 2025 Forester, Subaru wisely didn’t fix what wasn’t broken. The company’s research showed that Forester owners are more likely than the average consumer to own dogs or partake in gear-intensive activities like camping and hiking. These customers put a priority on off-road capability and safety, as well as cargo- and passenger-hauling versatility within a relatively tidy overall footprint, so Subaru made sure such virtues continued.\n\nThe dimensions of the new model change only fractionally from the previous generation, and the characteristic boxy profile stays mostly the same, but with crisper body lines all around. For a more detailed look at the 2025 Forester’s styling updates, check out our article where we took a look up close.\n\nAs before, the Forester lineup includes Base, Premium, Sport, Limited and Touring trims, but Subaru has added some trim-specific details for greater differentiation between them. The off-road-fortified Wilderness version doesn’t make the jump to the new-generation platform — at least not yet.  Subaru is planning to introduce a new-generation Wilderness in the near future, but at least for the 2025 model year, the previous-generation Wilderness model carries over.\n\nExcellent Cabin Space and Visibility\n\nThe Forester remains one of the most space-efficient, commodious vehicles in its class. The tall, upright roofline and large windows give the cabin an airy feel and provide excellent all-around visibility. The thin windshield pillars and front quarter windows make for especially good lines of sight to the front corners of the vehicle. Headroom and legroom are generous in the front seats and good for average-size adults in the backseat, although the housing for the available panoramic moonroof (which is standard on all but the base trim) intrudes a bit on headroom for extra-tall occupants.\n\nBy factory measurements, the Forester doesn’t have the most cargo room in its class, but it’s competitive nonetheless, and Subaru has given good attention to real-world use. The extra-wide rear liftgate opening, low cargo-floor height and minimal intrusion from the rear wheelhouses facilitate easy loading and unloading. In addition to the small hooks built into either side of the cargo area and the headliner just inside the liftgate opening, Subaru has included screw-in accessory mounting points on the cargo-area walls and the underside of the liftgate; these can mount extra hooks or other cargo-area accessories for additional versatility.\n\nThe optional power liftgate now comes with hands-free, kick-activated opening and closing — just the ticket when your hands are full with backpacks or your Alaskan Malamute (though I was a little surprised to realize the Forester didn’t already offer this feature). The rear doors open almost 90 degrees, which makes it easier to load cargo or get little ones in and out of car seats. A textured plastic surface at the base of the rear door openings provides a handy step for accessing roof-mounted cargo. Roof rails are now standard on all Foresters — the Sport and Touring have low-profile rails, the others raised rails.\n\nAcceleration Still Meh … at Least for Now\n\nThe Forester’s 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine receives several updates that are aimed at improving efficiency, emissions, noise levels and the like, but a horsepower infusion isn’t among the upgrades. In fact, the horsepower rating drops slightly, from 182 to 180 hp, but torque output rises from 176 to 178 pounds-feet, and the torque peak arrives at 3,700 rpm instead of 4,400 rpm. So, while it might feel a bit peppier in around-town driving than the previous generation, the Forester’s acceleration remains middling at best. Summoning adequate passing or merging power requires pushing the gas pedal to the floor, and even then, the Forester feels quite sluggish — especially when climbing a steep mountain road. Our test drive occurred at elevations approaching 6,000 feet in some places, and the thinner air here negatively affects engine performance, especially a naturally aspirated engine like the Forester’s.\n\nA hybrid version of the new Forester is expected to launch soon, likely as a 2026 model, but Subaru has been tight-lipped on the new powertrain’s specs. We’re hopeful the planned Forester Hybrid will deliver a bump in horsepower (200-210 hp would be sufficient, thanks) as well as improved fuel economy.\n\nSpeaking of fuel economy, though we haven’t had a chance to do our own real-world testing yet, the 2025 Forester’s EPA ratings of 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined (25/32/28 mpg for Sport and Touring trims) are class-competitive, if a mile or two per gallon behind comparable class leaders. It’s worth noting, though, that the Forester’s fuel-tank capacity is 16.6 gallons — a gallon or two more than some class rivals — which makes for a driving range comfortably more than 400 miles, or better than 500 miles in optimal highway driving conditions.\n\nPleasant Handling, Cushy Ride Quality\n\nSubaru says the new Forester’s structure benefits from three times more structural adhesive, among other improvements, and it’s 10% more torsionally rigid than the outgoing model. I drove the Forester over some seriously rutted gravel roads, including mountain trails that were covered in a few inches of snow, and the suspension was respectably absorbent and composed over all of it.\n\nThe steering feel is notably refined, especially when passing over sharp bumps and ruts — a dual-pinion steering gear adapted from the WRX compact performance sedan reduces kickback through the steering wheel. We split our driving time between a Sport and a Limited; Subaru says the Sport has a uniquely tuned suspension for a sportier on-road feel, but I couldn’t discern much of a difference from behind the wheel.\n\nThe Forester’s boxy shape means wind rush is fairly noticeable in highway driving, along with some tire roar. Quietness is notably improved overall, however, thanks in part to added sound-deadening material. The Forester’s engine has a rather hoarse sound, but the noise is well muffled inside the cabin; it intrudes only slightly during hard acceleration.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2025 Subaru Forester Stays the Course, Gets Enhanced Tech Features\n2025 Subaru Forester: Bolder Exterior Styling, New Tech, Priced From $31,090\n2023 Mazda CX-50 Vs. 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness: Who Off-Roads Better?\nResearch the 2025 Subaru Forester\nShop for a New Subaru Forester\nClassy Cabin Trimmings, New Tech and Safety Features\n\nIn addition to the improved quietness, the Forester’s cabin materials are nicely upgraded, with an upscale look and feel (at least in the Sport, Limited and Touring variants) and good fit and finish. Among the new features are a 360-degree camera system and a rearview camera mirror (for an unobstructed rear view when passengers or cargo block the traditional mirror), but both of these features are restricted to the top Touring trim.\n\nA new-to-the-Forester infotainment system with a portrait-style 11.6-inch touchscreen is standard on all but the Base trim. We’ve used this same basic system in the redesigned-for-2024 Crosstrek and Impreza, and while it’s a net improvement over the previous layout, it’s not without its quirks. Most of the climate controls are absorbed into the bottom of the touchscreen (we find physical buttons and knobs easier to use when driving), and some of our editors have had problems connecting their phones via the wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity (another newly available feature for 2025, along with a wireless charging pad). Though I had no problems viewing the screen with my transitional-tint prescription glasses, some editors had issues seeing the infotainment screen clearly when wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nNew safety features include standard Emergency Stop Assist, which can automatically bring the vehicle to a stop, activate the hazard lights and unlock the doors if the driver becomes unresponsive to warnings while using adaptive cruise control. Subaru says the Forester’s standard EyeSight driver-assist technology has been improved via a third camera for a wider field of view, along with updated control software and the addition of an electric brake booster.\n\nPricing and On-Sale Date\n\nThe Forester is competitively priced across the line, starting at $31,090 in Base form and running to $41,390 for the fully equipped Touring (prices include $1,395 destination). Whether you’re an outdoorsy type or, heck, even a couch potato, the 2025 Forester offers lots to like. It’s slated to begin arriving at dealerships in mid-May.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Dec. 17, 2024, to reflect the 2024 Forester Wilderness carries over for 2025 on the previous-generation platform.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Forester?\n\nThe 2023 Subaru Forester is a five-seat compact SUV with standard all-wheel drive. Getting the Forester down the road is a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Fuel economy is class-competitive at an EPA-estimated 29 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving, but it dips to 26 mpg if you choose the off-road-themed Wilderness trim, which rides on a raised suspension and all-terrain tires. The Forester competes against popular models such as the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Hyundai Tucson. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Forester?\n\nOther than slightly higher prices, the Subaru Forester carries over essentially unchanged from 2022.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Forester Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n6.5-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSplit-folding second row\nSatellite radio\nFour-speaker stereo\n17-inch steel wheels\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nAdaptive cruise control with lane centering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nHeated front seats\nLeather seating\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRaised suspension (Wilderness)\nPanoramic sunroof\nRear air vents\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Forester?\n\nThe Subaru Forester has a low entry price, a fuel-efficient engine, and a spacious interior that’s attractive and feels built to last. The four-cylinder engine is wheezy when you ask too much of it, but standard AWD is something many SUV shoppers will appreciate more than oodles of horsepower. The base Forester is a bargain, but moving up at least one trim level gets you handy features like keyless entry, push-button start, rear air vents and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. We think it’s worth the upgrade.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLaunched for the 1998 model year, Subarus crossover, all-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle was redesigned for 2001 with a fresh appearance in the front and rear. The 2002 model went on sale in April 2001. The new Forester packs more standard equipment than before and comes with a new Premium Package.\n\nNew standard features include daytime running lights and a cargo area cover, as well as a dual-mode rear wiper with single-speed and fixed intermittent modes and washer. Subaru still offers both the L and step-up S models, but a new Premium Package for the S edition includes leather-trimmed upholstery, which is offered only in the Forester S with automatic transmission.\n\nExterior\nWhile other Subarus resemble passenger cars, the four-door Forester is a compact SUV with a taller body than its mates. Side body cladding has been changed from Titanium Pearl to Graystone metallic for 2002 models. Like Subarus Impreza models, the Forester rides a 99.4-inch wheelbase. The overall length is 175.6 inches, and it stands 65 inches tall.\n\nAll Foresters have a roof-top luggage rack, heavy-duty suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars, and fog lights. A power moonroof is installed on the S edition, which wears monotone paint instead of the usual two-tone appearance. Gold-accented aluminum alloy wheels hold P215/60HR16 tires on the Forester S, while the Forester L gets 15-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nWith a seating capacity for five occupants, the Forester has bucket seats up front and a split, folding rear seat. Floor and overhead consoles are equipped with storage areas. Cloth upholstery is standard, with leather available as an option for either model. Other Forester options are offered only in packages.\n\nStandard L equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, power mirrors and door locks, a tilt steering wheel, cassette stereo system, cargo cover, integrated window antenna, rear defroster and wiper/washer, carpeted floormats and five cupholders. Selecting the S edition adds such extras as an in-dash six-CD changer and an all-weather package, which includes heated seats and mirrors as well as a limited-slip differential.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMaking 165 horsepower and 166 pounds-feet of torque, the Foresters horizontally opposed 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine also is used in the redesigned Impreza series. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed-automatic unit is sold as an option. Permanently engaged all-wheel is standard, as it is on all Subaru models. When properly equipped, the Forester can tow as much as 1 ton.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags are standard, and the Forester S also has side-impact airbags. Antilock brakes are standard on all models, but the Forester S has all-disc brakes instead of the front-disc/rear-drum setup used on the Forester L.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThere arent many tangible faults, but some are difficult to pinpoint; yet the Forester doesnt seem quite as friendly as it should be. This is somewhat concerning because Subarus SUV faces greater competition these days not only with the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, but also with Fords Escape and Mazdas Tribute.\n\nDue to its easily manageable size and utility, the Forester is appealing for the most part. But it does suffer from a ride that can get tiring on long trips. In addition to hitting some bumps a little too hard, its just jittery enough on the highway to become displeasing. The Forester steers with a very light touch and requires little correction on straightaways.\n\nThrottle response is rather eager and spirited. The powertrain is quiet at all times, and the automatic transmission operates smoothly with only a bit of a blip noted during some shifts. Gauges are very good, though the stereo sits quite low.\n\nThe drivers seat is supportive but doesnt feel totally comfortable, due in part to its short seat bottom. Front-seat space is fine, but elbow room could be more abundant. Knee room can be marginal in the backseat, but headroom is adequate. Three people arent going to squeeze into the rear unless theyre quite slim.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The Forester is styled more like an SUV than Subaru’s other compact vehicles, the Impreza and Crosstrek. Changes are minimal for 2016, with all Forester models getting a touch-screen multimedia system (6.2 inches is the standard size). A subscription-based emergency communication system is also now available. Compare the 2016 Forester with the 2015 model here.\n\nWe tested a 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Limited with an option package that included adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with autonomous braking, an upgraded stereo and a 7.0-inch multimedia screen.\n\nThe Forester competes with small SUVs such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Mazda CX-5. You can compare them all here. For a more in-depth comparison against a wider selection of SUVs, check out our $28,000 SUV Challenge.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe Forester doesn’t break any new ground in the styling department; Subaru stayed with the traditional, boxy SUV look. It’s not ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but its distinguishing characteristic is that – at least to my eyes – the wheels appear too small for the body.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Forester offers good acceleration from a stop and power is generally good across the range. The Forester uses a continuously variable automatic transmission, and its immediate response makes it one of the better ones on the market. For my money, the Honda CR-V’s CVT is the best in the segment, but the Forester is a close second. I find the Rogue’s CVT to be disappointing in its weird, elastic response. Still, no CVT can match a well-designed conventional automatic transmission, so all these SUVs trail the CX-5 in terms of response.\n\nOverall power is modest, with the Forester just not feeling as quick as the CR-V or CX-5. And it’s noisy. Wind and road noise aren’t so bad, but there’s more engine noise in the Forester than its competitors.\n\nStopping with confidence isn’t really the Forester’s strong suit, either. It has a very soft, mushy brake pedal.\n\nRide comfort is a mixed bag. The Forester absorbs bumps and big potholes very well, but there can be an odd bouncing/bucking sensation, as if the front is diving and the rear is rising when the road is really bad. It just feels choppy. The CR-V again leads the category in this area, and I’d put the Rogue second, the Forester third and the sporty, rough-riding CX-5 last in terms of ride comfort.\n\nWhen it comes to handling, the Forester is surprisingly capable and willing to be pushed, but it’s let down both by its mushy brakes and by its steering. The Forester’s steering simply gets too light at higher speeds, so it doesn’t offer enough feedback to inspire confidence.\n\nThe Forester we tested is rated 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined, which is competitive with all-wheel-drive versions of the CR-V (25/31/27 mpg), CX-5 (24/30/26 mpg) and Rogue (25/32/28 mpg). Unlike the Forester, which has standard all-wheel drive, those other models also offer front-wheel drive, which boosts the Honda’s combined rating by 2 mpg and the Mazda’s by 3 mpg. (The FWD Rogue’s city and highway figures are both 1 mpg higher, but its combined rating is unchanged.)\n\nIn addition, there are two other powertrains available in the Forester: A version with the same four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission that’s rated 22/29/25 mpg, and one with a 250-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that gets 23/28/25 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Forester’s standout attribute on the inside is its phenomenally good visibility. This is an SUV, so you ride higher than you would in a car, but the great view is also due to the fact that there’s a lot of glass. The main windows are large, and there are also small, sail-shaped windows by the side mirrors that help visibility. The rear window was so large, in fact, that I was startled at first by how much I could see.  It’s head-and-shoulders better in this regard than any competitor.\n\nThe Forester is also roomy. I’m 6-foot, 2-inches tall, and I wasn’t cramped for space either in the front or in the backseat. There’s one piece of trim by the driver’s right knee that I think could use some padding; when I brushed up against it, it didn’t feel great. The seats weren’t my favorites, either, as they offered little thigh support and are designed such that I felt I was perched on top of the seat rather than being supported by it. A bit of side bolstering or more seat contour would be welcome.\n\nStill, couple the Forester’s excellent visibility with the panoramic moonroof we had in our test car (it’s standard on all but the base, 2.5i model), and it’s hard to feel claustrophobic in this SUV.\n\nThe rest of the Forester’s interior isn’t a clear-cut winner. The materials aren’t bad, but they’re more functional than stylish. In this area, the Rogue is the segment’s clear winner. The CR-V ranks next and the CX-5 and Forester trail. A little more padding and less-plasticky trim would go a long way toward bringing the Forester up with the best in the market.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe Forester does well in this area, with everything you need within easy reach when it comes to adjusting things such as the climate control system.\n\nWhere the Forester struggles is in its setup for adjusting a few of the power controls and electronics. For starters, the USB ports in the center storage console are hard to access: I felt like it was anatomically impossible to bend my wrist in the manner needed to connect my phone’s cord to the port.\n\nAlso, the touch-screen was too sensitive and would frequently jump to something other than what I wanted because I’d accidentally brushed it. The Forester is the only car I’ve been in over the past year where that’s happened.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Forester’s cargo area is quite large behind the backseat, and it expands to a very good size with the seat down. If there’s a nit to pick with the cargo area, it’s that the rear wheel wells intrude upon it, so carrying very wide things, such as a television, could prove problematic. On the whole, though, it handled everything I threw at it – a bicycle, groceries, Christmas shopping and gym gear — very well.\n\nUp front, there’s a nice, deep center console that — USB port location aside — offers good space for larger cellphones, gloves and sunglasses.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Subaru Forester is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus, meaning it scored the highest rating of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in all five of the agency’s crash tests, and that it earned an additional superior rating thanks to its optional forward collision prevention equipment.\n\nThe Forester is in good company; six other models in IIHS’ Small SUVs category share Top Safety Pick Plus status, including the CR-V and CX-5. The Rogue trails with a collision-prevention rating of basic. Three other direct competitors have a score of poor in the front small-overlap test.\n\nIn addition to the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, our test car came with Subaru’s optional EyeSight system that includes pre-collision automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Browse the Forester’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe beauty of today’s compact SUV market is its variety. Some models are fairly fun to drive (CX-5), some offer a pretty interior (Rogue), and others offer a comfortable ride with a blend of nice features (CR-V). When we tested them head-to-head, their scores reflected their varying strengths and weaknesses. In the case of the Forester, those weaknesses include an interior that’s more functional than fun (or nice), overboosted steering, mushy brakes and a choppy ride.\n\nThe Forester succeeds as a small SUV that offers standard all-wheel drive, a good cargo area and a roomy interior with fantastic visibility. It also ranks as the most utilitarian of its competitors, and that’s not a bad thing when discussing SUVs. Not every car needs to be as nice and pretty as your living room, especially if you’re the outdoorsy sort, live a little off the beaten path or just like to haul messy things around, such as pets. Nor does an SUV need to scorch the slalom course if all you’re after is the ability to get where you’re going in inclement weather.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Subaru Forester?\n\nThe 2024 Subaru Forester is a five-seat compact SUV with standard all-wheel drive. Moving the Forester down the road is a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Fuel economy is class-competitive, with the Forester returning an EPA-estimated 29 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving; this dips to 26 mpg if you choose the off-road-themed Wilderness trim, which rides on a raised suspension and all-terrain tires. The Forester competes against popular models such as the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Hyundai Tucson. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Subaru Forester?\n\nOther than slightly higher prices, the Subaru Forester carries over unchanged from 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Subaru Forester Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n6.5-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSplit, folding second row\nSatellite radio\nFour-speaker stereo\n17-inch steel wheels\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nAdaptive cruise control with lane centering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nHeated front seats\nLeather seating\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRaised suspension (Wilderness)\nPanoramic moonroof\nRear air vents\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Subaru Forester?\n\nThe Subaru Forester has a low entry price, a fuel-efficient engine, and a spacious interior that’s attractive and feels built to last. The four-cylinder engine is wheezy when you ask too much of it, but standard AWD is something many SUV shoppers will appreciate more than oodles of horsepower. The base Forester is a bargain, but moving up at least one trim level gets you handy features like keyless entry, push-button start, rear air vents and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. We think it’s worth the upgrade.",

      "expert_review": "How to praise a car when a powerful alternative waits in the wings?\n\nSubaru is reaching for power &#151; turbocharged power &#151; in an effort to broaden its national appeal. Beloved for its utility and its full-line all-wheel-drive systems in regions where the snow flies and ice forms on the roads, the company needs a new edge where the roads stay dry and weather isn’t a seasonal challenge.\n\nThat’s why the rally-inspired WRX was brought to these shores and why &#151; hold on to your seats here &#151; a 300 horsepower version of the WRX is coming soon to a showroom near you. The target: aggressive, young drivers.\n\nThey are not the folks who would buy this week’s test car, the 2003 Subaru Forester XTS, a capable, dependable, roomy box of a car.\n\nIf there can be said to exist &quot;politically correct&quot; SUVs, the popular Forester, which accounts for nearly a quarter of Subaru’s 175,000 annual sales, would stand square in their midst. These are cars that haul people and goods through all sorts of weather, are not gas-guzzlers, do not threaten other drivers with their bulk, yet offer at least a touch of the utility of their larger brethren. Among them are the Suzuki Vitara, Toyota RAV4, Suzuki XL-7, Saturn Vue, Jeep Liberty, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Mitsubishi Outlander.\n\nThe Forester, introduced in 1997, has been among the best of them. Known for reliability, safety, and economy, it was not a car to inspire lovers of design grace or those seeking high performance.\n\nIndeed, the 2.5-liter boxer engine in the test model produces only 165 horsepower and, coupled with the standard five-speed manual transmission, it is part of a powertrain that lets you know it’s working very hard for you when the car is fully loaded and pulling out to pass or to climb long grades. I also found the stick shift to be a bit sloppy, reminding me of long-throw cars of yore rather than the quick-click shifters that many cars feature today.\n\nFor some people &#151; and fans of the car, as it exists, are myriad &#151; basic, dependable power is all that is sought. For others, however, a turbo boost would be a good thing and that’s why what looms is so appealing. For 2004, Subaru will offer a new Forester with a 2.5-liter boxer engine that is turbocharged and produces 210 horsepower.\n\nThis will represent Subaru’s attempt to stand in two worlds, one of dependable utility, the other of snappy performance. The company’s literature says the turbo Forester &quot;enhances sporty driving while fully preserving the … crossover SUV design approach&quot; &#151; meaning you get your standard box but it comes with a bigger punch. For those who like the earlier powerplant, the 165-horsepower engine will continue to be offered.\n\nKnowing that they shouldn’t tinker with the basics of a stable workhorse, Subaru’s redesign of the Forester for 2003, which c arries over into 2004, did little to alter the appearance of the car. It still looks like a high-top sneaker. The front corners have been rounded, and the grille has been given a broad horizontal cast.\n\nInside, it has been made roomier with an extra cubic foot of space up front, 3 more cubic feet in the middle, and, with the 60-40 split rear seats folded down, 5 extra cubic feet of cargo space, up to 64 cubic feet. That’s a spacious bin for weekend hauling.\n\nThe interior remains basic with three gauges behind the wheel &#151; one for fuel and temperature, another for the speedometer, and a third for the tachometer. The flat top dash is bisected by a dimpled swath of soft material that continues its horizontal flow to the upper doors front and rear. A brushed-metallic treatment surrounds the dials and knobs of the center console. Those controls, for audio and climate, are big, easy to figure out, easy to use.\n\nOn the road, the Forester handled far more ike a car than an SUV. It sat flat in passing lane changes and displayed minimal body roll in hard, back road cornering.\n\nConsidering that it would appear to be top heavy, its stability was surprising. Then I realized that all that interior room is packaged in a vehicle that sits 62.6 inches high &#151; 7 to 8 inches lower than midsize SUVs such as the Toyota Highlander and a good foot lower than the Nissan Xterra.\n\nIts suspension &#151; independent strut with control arm, coil springs, and antiroll bar up front and, in the rear, independent strut, trailing and lateral links, coil springs and antiroll bar, &#151; was more than a match for the car’s rolling 3,211 pounds of weight, plus a few hundred pounds of passengers.\n\nDriving in a late-winter splash of snow &#151; about four unplowed inches &#151; its all-wheel-drive system moved it smoothly and safely at decent speed with all four wheels finding full-time purchase. One great feature is a system Subaru calls Hill Holder. When facing up a grade at a stop, you can depress both the clutch and the brake, then with the clutch still depressed, move your foot off the brake without rolling back, and go for the gas for a smooth start.\n\nFor now, the Forester is the biggest vehicle in Subaru’s fleet. The Legacy and Impreza, in various forms, hold the basic car customers; the Baja &#151; part pickup truck, part wagon, part SUV &#151; adds the funk factor. The spread of turbos through the lineup will only add to that funk potential and aid Subaru in reaching a stated goal of 250,000 units sold per year.\n\nAnd coming soon will be a full-sized, seven-passenger Subaru, built in partnership with General Motors, which owns a healthy chunk of Subaru’s parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.\n\nWonder what they’ll put in that beast for a powerplant?\n\nNice touch: The additional bolstering of the front seats. They seem far more firm, supportive, and comfortable than I remember Subaru seats being.\n\nAnnoyance: Speaking of seats: It would be nice if, given all that headroom, it were possible to raise the driver’s seat considerably, affording that high-riding view that SUV fans appreciate.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nThough it’s now on the most recent Subaru Forester platform, differences between this Wilderness model and the last generation are minimal.\nAs it was before, the 2026 Forester Wilderness is still one of the best all-around adventure vehicles on the market.\nThe biggest changes are a new infotainment system and an available digital instrument panel.\n\nOnly Subaru could get away with a redesign like the new 2026 Forester Wilderness. Compared to the prior generation, the biggest clear change for this “all-new” off-road-focused Forester is a new all-terrain tire that’s slightly wider and taller, an upgrade that, in conjunction with a revised suspension, adds just 0.1 inch to the SUV’s ground clearance, which is now 9.3 inches. Everything else, for the most part, is right where you left it on the last gen. Yup, only Subaru …\n\nNo critique here. Subaru is the back-to-back-to-back undefeated champ when it comes to knowing its current and future customer bases, with a range of models that appear only incrementally updated compared to their prior generation. With Subie, it’s very much a case of giving the crowd what they want.\n\nRelated: 2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness Up Close: Redesigned and More Capable\n\nIn real terms, this is undeniably a next-gen iteration of the Forester Wilderness, even if the hardware changes are slight. Alongside that new tire, revised suspension and minor bump in ride height, a new transmission cooler kicks towing capacity up 500 pounds to 3,500 pounds, and a temp sensor for the rear differential warns of overexertion. Everything else is a transposition of the last Wilderness onto the latest-gen Forester platform, including the aluminum skid plate, shorter final-drive ratio, beefier roof rails, X-Mode off-road drive modes, synthetic StarTex water-resistant upholstery, yellow/gold accents, tow hooks, extra body cladding and a whole heap of Wilderness badging.\n\n2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness, off-road rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the 2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness Drive?\nTakeaway: The Wilderness’ 180 horsepower from a 2.5-liter flat-four-cylinder engine doesn’t feel like enough, especially when passing and merging. Handling, ride quality and off-road capability, however, are great.\n\nAlso carried over is a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter flat-four engine that’s shared with the rest of the Forester lineup. Its 180 hp and 178 pounds-feet of torque are unchanged, as is my frustration with its performance; the on-paper figures are fine when compared with the competitive field, but acceleration feels flat and sluggish throughout the entire rev range. Out on the rural back roads of Washington state, passing a timber truck oozing along at 20 mph under the speed limit was an exercise in both bravery and timing. Unless you have at least a quarter-mile of clear visibility, good luck feeling anything but nervous as the Forester screams its way through acceleration best described as “Are you sure you won’t hit that oncoming Chevrolet Silverado!?”\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThat’s my only beef, really. Everything else is the same satisfying sixth-gen Forester, only now with oodles of ground clearance and a fat-sidewall all-terrain tire that’s equally at home bashing through potholes as it is scrambling up a moderately treacherous trail. The 9.3 inches of ground clearance will have you wincing for an undercarriage crash ‘n’ bash that never comes, with the Wilderness capable of navigating sizable gullies and stepped trail sections that you’d expect to stymie even the most capable unibody SUV.\n\nThat was the theme of our Wilderness trail time. Pick a line, gingerly dip one (or more) wheels in, grimace a bit, give it half throttle and scramble through without drama. There were no spotters or trail nannies out here, either, as Subaru folks put full faith in the Wilderness’ capabilities (and our off-road skills) as we crawled through slow, rocky sections and sashayed through the faster grit.\n\nYour mileage (and traction) may vary through deeper sand and mud, but there was enough grip from the Yokohama Geolandar tires and clever power transfer through the all-wheel-drive system that we never toggled through the dual-function X-Mode terrain profiles. Even when the car teetered with one wheel in the air or when starting from a dead stop in the middle of a stream crossing, the Wilderness yoinked itself through obstacles with little more than some slip and scrabble from individual wheels.\n\nYou shouldn’t attempt Moab, but it packs 10 times the capability needed for an unmaintained dirt road, barely defined sandy desert two-track or unplowed pass en route to the ski lodge. It’s one of the best adventure-ready vehicles for active-lifestyle folks who off-road not as a hobby but as a byproduct of other activities.\n\nHow Is the 2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness for Daily Driving?\nTakeaway: Despite the lifted suspension and all-terrain tires, the 2026 Forester Wilderness is as or more comfortable than the regular Forester, with good tech and an airy interior.\n\nFor the days when you’re just commuting, the Forester’s unibody bones shine through the REI wrapper. The all-terrain tires and jacked ride height make it a smidge squishy on back roads, but the excellent dynamic baseline set by the Subaru Global Platform underneath means it’s never sketchy and well offset by the Wilderness’ impressive capacity to hit mute on broken pavement. It’s also still the lovely glass box as before, with exceptional visibility and a unique airiness to the cabin not present elsewhere in the compact SUV class.\n\nAnd despite my moaning, I’m loath to admit that power and straight-line performance is likely completely and positively adequate for the majority of buyers. Merging at speed requires a stout right foot, but you’ll get there without any real danger, and it’s happy to cruise at or above highway speeds with no more drama than the competition. The cabin is also well isolated outside of moments of aggro acceleration.\n\nInterior tech is solid, too. A vertically oriented 11.6-inch center touchscreen handles infotainment and most vehicle functions, supported by an optional 12.3-inch digital driver display. I prefer hard controls for the engine stop-start function and heated seats, but the dedicated digi-space for these on the bottom of the center display is a decent alternative. Subaru’s EyeSight active-safety tech is good, but the lane departure steering assist system is still overly active to the point where I personally would keep it permanently toggled off.\n\nHow Much Does the 2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness Cost?\nTakeaway: The no-option 2026 Forester Wilderness starts at $39,835 (including destination).\n\nFrom a materials and presentation perspective, the Wilderness feels like driving a hiking boot — a good thing, I promise. I suspect most folks aren’t performatively purchasing the Wilderness trim and are frequently sweaty, gritty and salty (or a combination thereof) on any given weekend. For this, that moisture-resistant StarTex upholstery is happy after a simple wipe-down, and standard rubber floormats and a cargo area tray keep crud from the carpets. That roof rack is a particularly useful feature, with the prior generation’s 800-pound static capacity carrying over.\n\nIt’s certainly nicer to live with and drive on a daily basis than some of the larger off-road SUVs — and cheaper, too. A no-option 2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness is $39,835, slightly undercutting the similar Ford Bronco Sport Badlands, which starts at $42,110, and significantly whupping the larger, beefier and pricier $51,185 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road for value and ground clearance, if you’ll believe it.\n\nYou won’t find a more capable unibody SUV than the Forester Wilderness short of springing for the top trims of the Bronco Sport. For returning Forester owners, welcome back — will you have your usual? Excellent choice. This model year, the chef decided to add just a pinch of spice, but don’t worry, everything’s (nearly) right where you left it — just the way you like it.\n\n2026 Subaru Forester Wilderness, off-road rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore Subaru Forester News From Cars.com:\n\nHow Much Is the 2026 Subaru Forester?\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nWhich Compact SUV Has the Most Cargo Room?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Subaru Forester?\n2025 Subaru Forester Review: Redesigned, But on the Same Not-So-Beaten Path\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

All-wheel drive is standard, and trim levels include the base 2.5 X, Sports 2.5 X, upscale 2.5 X L.L.Bean Edition, Sports 2.5 XT and 2.5 XT Limited. Turbo models with an automatic transmission have a tweaked all-wheel-drive system for 2008, and they also gain an electronic stability system. Changes for other models are largely cosmetic.\n\nA 173-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder powers all but the 2.5 XT, which gets a 224-hp turbocharged four-cylinder. There is an optional four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nGround clearance is 8.1 inches (7.9 inches for 2.5 XT models).\n\nExterior\nThe Forester features flared front fenders and blister-type rear quarter panels. For 2008, all Sports models get a new front bumper, black-painted headlight and taillight surrounds and silver-painted roof rails. The Sports 2.5 XT adds a body-colored roof spoiler and new 17-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels.\n\nInterior\nSport bucket seats in the front and a 60/40-split folding rear seat can accommodate up to five occupants. Subaru emphasizes the Forester’s high seating position. For 2008, an audio system with seven upgraded speakers and a subwoofer is standard on Sports and L.L.Bean models. L.L.Bean models also get a standard auto-dimming rearview mirror, rear cargo area carpeting and a standard cargo accessory tray.\n\nStandard features on the 2.5 X include power windows and door locks, keyless entry and a CD audio system. A Premium Package adds automatic climate control, a panoramic moonroof, heated seats and a power driver’s seat, among other items. Sports models add to that aluminum alloy pedal covers and anthracite black cloth upholstery, among other features. The Sports 2.5 XT adds a different gauge setup. The L.L.Bean edition has embossed leather seats, a wood and leather-wrapped steering wheel with a matching shifter handle, and L.L.Bean-embroidered floormats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubaru’s Impreza series uses the same 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder as the Forester. The regular engine develops 173 hp. A turbocharged version that yields 224 hp goes into 2.5 XT models. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard on all models except the 2.5 X L.L.Bean Edition, which gets a four-speed automatic transmission. The automatic transmission is optional for other models. A Hill Holder clutch on manual-shift models makes it easier to start the car on inclines.\n\nFor 2008, turbocharged models get Subaru’s Variable Torque Distribution that uses a electronically controlled hydraulic transfer case to control power distribution between the front and rear wheels. Turbo models also get an electronic stability system.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags, front active head restraints and antilock brakes are standard. The ABS system has electronic brake-force distribution for better front and rear proportioning. Side curtain airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe frisky Forester XT is sensible and satisfying, especially with the turbocharged engine and the manual gearbox. There’s a bit of turbo lag after pushing the gas pedal. Foresters ride pleasantly enough over smooth surfaces, but bumps and ruts can produce somewhat harsh reactions.\n\nSpace is ample in the front and adequate in back, with abundant headroom and toe room, though knee space is less bountiful. The front seat bottoms are short but nicely supportive. The gauges and controls are ordinary but sensible.\n\nThe easy-to-drive Forester maneuvers nimbly, handles with a light touch and yields a friendly, comfortable feel. Some driveline noise occurs during acceleration.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSubaru’s “crossover” wagons for 2005 went on sale in early summer of 2004 with a handful of revisions and one new model in the lineup. At the 2004 New York International Auto Show, Subaru unveiled its latest collaboration with the L.L.Bean organization: the Forester 2.5 XS L.L.Bean Edition.\n\nThe L.L.Bean Edition features special embroidered floormats, beige leather-trimmed upholstery and an auto-dimming compass mirror. The rear seatbacks and cargo floor are covered with a water-resistant surface, and this Forester version flaunts a large glass moonroof.\n\nA potent new version of Subaru’s crossover wagon debuted in 2004. The Forester 2.5 XT is equipped with a 210-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder that mates with either a standard five-speed-manual gearbox or an optional four-speed-automatic transmission. The value-priced 2.5 X and premium 2.5 XS use a 165-hp, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed engine. All-wheel drive is standard on all models.\n\nExterior\nAs part of its 2003 redesign, the Forester has flared front fenders, blister-type rear quarter panels and an enlarged grille. The Forester’s appearance hasn’t changed appreciably for 2005.\n\nThe new L.L.Bean Edition is the only model with steel-gray or platinum-silver metallic bumpers and body cladding. The bumpers and cladding are textured gray on the 2.5 X and body-colored on XS and XT models.\n\nFeatures on the L.L.Bean Edition include a self-leveling rear suspension, security system, durable cargo floor and 10-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels. Raised black-letter, 16-inch tires are mounted on the 2.5 X, while the 2.5 XS has new eight-spoke alloy wheels.\n\nInterior\nSport bucket seats in the front and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat can accommodate up to five occupants. Subaru emphasizes the Forester’s high seating position. A Hill Holder clutch on manual-shift models makes it easier to start the car on inclines.\n\nNew beige or gray tricot upholstery is used in the 2.5 X, which includes an air filtration system. An eight-way power driver’s seat is installed in the 2.5 XS and 2.5 XT.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubaru’s Impreza series uses the same 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engines. The engine in the regular versions of the 2.5 X, 2.5 XS and 2.5 XS L.L.Bean Edition develops 165 hp. A turbocharged version that yields 210 hp goes into the 2.5 XT. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard on all models except the 2.5 XS L.L.Bean Edition, which gets a four-speed-automatic transmission. The automatic transmission is optional for the other models.\n\nPermanently engaged all-wheel drive is standard on all Subaru vehicles, but an active-type system in models equipped with the automatic transmission incorporates sensors that monitor weight distribution.\n\nSafety\nDual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags, front active head restraints and antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPerformance in an XS equipped with the 2.5-liter engine is satisfying. Unlike early Foresters, recent models also ride pleasantly over any reasonable road surface.\n\nThe Forester operates with light handling and a friendly, comfortable feel overall. It runs quietly and is easy to drive. Other than a bit of restriction of the driver’s elbow, space in the front seat is good. The seats are firm but comfortable.",

      "expert_review": "CORNWALL, N.Y. Sometimes you just want reliability — a simple vehicle that does what it does well and does it repeatedly. You want the fossil-fueled version of the Timex. The watch is seldom fancy or pretty. It can be bought for a reasonable price at the local drugstore. But it will last as long as many more expensive timepieces, and it will keep time as well, often better, than many of them. The Timex watch exemplifies its marketing slogan: It “keeps on ticking.”\n\nThe Subaru Forester is the Timex of the automobile industry. First manufactured in Japan in 1997 and brought to the United States a year later, it has grown in popularity in regions such as this, places where winter can be truly wintry and where foothills actually lead to mountains.\n\nBut “popularity” is not the same as “acceptability.” The Forester is revered by its many loyalists, who tend to replace one Forester with another. It’s reviled by critics, who dismiss it as a household appliance, a “chick wagon” or a “girlie-man SUV.”\n\n(It’s odd how attributes such as reliability, service and economy frequently are viewed as “feminine” in the automobile business.)\n\nIt is now the third generation of the Forester, which was thoroughly revised in 2009 — made larger (three inches longer) and turned into more of a compact sport-utility vehicle than the little all-wheel-drive wagon it was.\n\nThe 2010 model driven for this column retains the strong taste of vanilla in terms of exterior and interior styling — far more satisfying than exciting. The same holds true for road performance — perfectly competent for dry-road highway runs, accelerates well when necessary and handles well in high-speed highway traffic.\n\nBut in overall demeanor and decorum, there is little about the 2010 Forester 2.5X Limited I drove here that would make a real truck man want to fall for a Forester. I don’t care.\n\nAgain, sometimes all you want is reliability. And my family and I were much in need of that attribute as the chilly rain on Mine Hill Road became thick frozen slush coated by light snow.\n\nThe soul of the Forester’s reliability is its horizontally opposed, four-cylinder, 170-horsepower engine and its symmetrical all-wheel-drive system. They work together well.\n\n“Horizontally opposed” means the engine’s cylinders are arranged side-by-side instead of in an “inline” (cylinders in a straight row) or “V” pattern.\n\nThe side-by-side cylinder arrangement reduces engine weight and saves space under the hood. That more efficient packaging offers certain benefits — better fuel economy via lower weight and better vehicle balance via a lower center of gravity because of the engine’s more ideal placement in the vehicle’s body.\n\nSubaru’s symmetrical all-wheel-drive system takes advantage of the Forester’s engine design and layout. By designing the Forester (and all other Subaru models) to be all-wheel drive from the ground up, Subaru was able to give its customers an all-wheel-drive system that shifts power symmetrically, side to side, pretty much assuring that one wheel is gripping when another is slipping.\n\nExcellent vehicle balance in combination with excellent traction is hard to beat when weather combines with road design — narrow foothill roads with deep drops on either side, covered with thickening slush — to assure that there will be some slipping at some point somewhere, as there was on this trip.\n\nThe Forester responded expertly — gripping as needed when needed; preventing short turns into skids from becoming longer, more dangerous skids; and handling potentially upsetting vehicle weight transfers with aplomb.\n\nI like that kind of performance, that sort of reliability. And I suppose that’s why the Forester’s buyer base, a key branch of the Subaru family, remains as strong as it is. The Forester loyalists believe in the Forester. The people who make the Forester obviously believe in them. In the automobile business, or in any other business, it doesn’t get much better than that.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2011 about the 2011 Subaru Forester. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\nIt’s never been the sharpest-looking crossover, inside or out, but the Subaru Forester strikes the sort of balance between driving fun, ride comfort and outright practicality that make some of its competitors seem downright frustrating in comparison.\nThe current, square-backed generation never blew anyone away with a progressive design or cabin quality, but its strengths become apparent as you sift through the glut of other small crossovers on the market. The five-seat crossover comes in 2.5X and 2.5XT editions — the X tells you it has a normally aspirated engine, while the XT represents a turbocharged four-cylinder. The X can be had in base, Premium, Limited and Touring trims, while the XT comes in Premium and Touring forms. All versions have standard all-wheel drive. Stack the trims up here, or compare the 2010 and 2011 Forester here. We evaluated a 2.5X Touring this time, but we’ve driven the turbocharged version in years past.\nBalanced DrivingSubaru deserves praise for blending competent handling with reasonable ride comfort though that’s a relatively recent phenomenon. Go back a generation, and many Subarus handled well but they rode firmly. In contrast, this Forester sucks up uneven asphalt and spits little of it into the cabin. It’s soft over grooved pavement and potholes alike. Driven back-to-back with eight other crossovers in our $29,000 SUV Shootout, I deemed the Forester nearly as comfortable as the Ford Escape and Dodge Journey. If it weren’t for the Subaru’s incessant road and wind noise, it might lead the class.\nA soft ride often makes for foggy reflexes, and that holds true here: Today’s Forester doesn’t carve corners as expertly as its firm predecessor did. Given the current competition, however, it still impresses. Our test car exhibited some body roll in hard corners, but the steering tracks the course well, with satisfying weight, feedback and turn-in precision. In tight quarters, the Forester’s exemplary 34.4-foot turning circle is handy, but some may wish for more power assist at low speeds.\nSubaru pairs a more advanced version of its full-time all-wheel drive with the automatic transmission (a stick shift is offered on the 2.5X base and Premium), which amplifies the fun. Leave the family at home, and you can actually kick the tail out and drift this thing — a maneuver most crossovers are utterly incapable of pulling off. Well done.\nThough its displacement remains about the same as before, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder is new this year. Even so, it remains in the junior varsity league of acceleration. Hamstrung by a low-tech four-speed automatic, it pulls the Forester through each gear in more of an 8K relay than a 100-meter sprint. Ascend an on-ramp, and you feel 1st gear wind out ever so gracelessly, until finally handing the baton, exhausted, to 2nd. Then the climb begins anew.\nAt least it’s an intuitive transmission, kicking down gears on the highway with little delay. The drivetrain’s 170 horsepower rating is identical to last year’s 2.5-liter, but combined EPA gas mileage with the manual or automatic is now 23 mpg. That’s a 1-mpg improvement over last year’s drivetrains, and it’s competitive with other all-wheel-drive crossovers.\nThe Forester’s optional turbo four-cylinder makes 224 hp. With more low-rev torque than many V-6 competitors, the turbo moves swiftly from stoplights. The transmission only has four speeds, though, and that limits the fun. What’s more, the drivetrain requires premium fuel. That puts a real damper on its otherwise competitive 21-mpg overall rating in comparisons with V-6 crossovers.\nPractical ConsiderationsSubaru’s full-time all-wheel drive powers all four wheels all the time, helping the crossover claw its way through muck that stops part-time all-wheel-drive systems cold. It’s only after driving other crossovers through heavy snow near our Chicago offices — or, more accurately, going nowhere at all in a few of them — that I fully appreciate the Forester’s resilience. An impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance (8.9 inches with the turbo) really helps when you’re trying to get through the deep stuff.\nAppreciated all year-round are the Forester’s sight lines, which are free of the descending rooflines, tiny rear-quarter windows and massive roof pillars seen elsewhere. The Forester easily won a blind-spot evaluation among small crossovers two years ago, and I’m confident it would still win against today’s competition.\nThe rectangular cargo area offers a modest 30.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 63.0 cubic feet when that seat is folded down. Both figures are at the low end of the segment. Without the Forester’s headroom-robbing panoramic moonroof, the base 2.5X has a more competitive 33.5 and 68.3 cubic feet, respectively.\nThe InsideInterior quality has never been Subaru’s strength, and the Forester needs work. Cabin materials improve on the Escape’s industrial plastics, but other competitors — particularly the Chevy Equinox, Journey and Honda CR-V — have handsomer finishes and more appealing controls. The Forester’s feel a generation old: a crummy headliner, undersized stereo knobs and a flimsy keyfob.\nOur test car’s leather seats were supportive during twisty roads and highway cruising alike, but the driver’s seat needs a longer adjustment range. At 5-foot-11, I could have used another inch or two of rearward travel. Legroom and headroom in the backseat is good, but the seat could sit a bit higher off the floor — an issue that dogs many small crossovers. There’s also a footwell-robbing center floor hump in back, something many other crossovers avoid.\nSafety, Features & PricingWith top scores in all evaluations, the Forester earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but received just two out of five stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s new side-impact pole ratings, which simulate a sideways encounter with a tree or telephone pole. The Forester scored better in NHTSA’s remaining evaluations, including a more conventional side-impact test, earning it an overall score of four out of five stars. Standard equipment includes the usual complement of front and side airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here to see all the Forester’s safety features.\nReliability for non-turbo models is exemplary; turbo models rate about average. The Forester 2.5X starts at $20,495. Given its standard all-wheel drive, that’s a steal — if you can live with a stick shift. The vast majority of shoppers will want the four-speed automatic, which runs an overpriced $1,200. Even with it, the Subaru costs roughly the same as most competing front-drive automatic crossovers.\nStandard features include power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control and a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack. Most trims include a panoramic moonroof and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with steering-wheel audio controls. Move up the line, and you can get a navigation system, heated leather seats and more. Turbo models start just under $27,000 and top out around $31,500. That’s relatively modest, given many competitors can spiral well into the mid-30s.\nForester in the MarketSubaru’s insistence on standard all-wheel drive, and its associated cost, will keep the Forester from ever topping segment sales lists. To its credit, the automaker has reduced the pricing and gas mileage penalty associated with all-wheel drive better than most. But the front-drive competition is likely to remain a little cheaper or a little more fuel efficient, and if you live in Florida or Texas, that math alone may keep you from ever visiting a Subaru dealership.\nThat said, the Forester’s future looks bright. Look at any segment of cars, and the sharpest ones are usually those introduced or redesigned most recently. The Forester’s mastery of the fundamentals is harder to beat, and that should keep it running strong all the way through this generation’s final years.\n\n\n\n  Send Kelsey an          email",

      "expert_review": "When I was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, my dad was what is now referred to as an “early adopter.” It seemed like we always had the latest gadget or gizmo around the house; we had the first portable tape player and the first remote-control television on our block, and we also had one of the first Turbo Hoover vacuums. What was the Turbo Hoover, you ask? Well, it was an upright vacuum with a handle that had about an inch of give forward and backward. When pushed forward, the vacuum’s turbo would kick in, propelling it ahead and, in the process, yanking my arm out of its socket. When pulled back, the Turbo Hoover would back over my toes at high speed. The Hoover’s not-so-saving grace was a red button on the handle that would turn off the turbo feature. Of course, once you pushed the button, you realized the Turbo Hoover weighed about 45 pounds. If you had thick orange shag carpet and used a Turbo Hoover without the turbo engaged, you’d wind up with some big guns.\n\nThe 2007 Subaru Forester powerfully reminds me of our old Turbo Hoover vac. The first tip off was the scoop on the Forester’s hood. If it only had a light inside, it would look just like a vacuum. After driving the Forester, I now know what it would have been like to be a dust mite riding atop that spastic vacuum. The two beasts have more in common than a Cyclops-looking front end – there’s also herky-jerky, uncontrollable acceleration. Add a sticky gearshift, and I’m swept back to my youth doing chores, because it’s a chore to drive this manual version of the Forester, people. My new policy is that any car that reminds me of gruntwork should be left in the dust.\n\nI wish, dear readers, that the list ended there. Alas, no. When I try to imagine how loud it would be to ride inside a vacuum, I just hop in the Forester and I have my answer. There is so much road noise, my 4-year-old (yes, my 4-year-old) complains that the car is too loud. I keep trying to roll the windows up because it sounds as though they’re all cracked about a centimeter, but they’re already rolled up. I can’t stop the noise!\n\nSpeaking of unstoppable noise, I hear a lot of complaints from the backseat of the Subaru. There are no easily accessible cupholders for the kids to use, and the only storage pocket is on the back of the passenger seat. I whine a little bit, too, about the uncomfortable driver’s seat. It feels as though the cushion has packed out even though there are only 6,000 miles on my test car. What’s up with that? And why can’t my kids and I have a little more legroom? I mean, as long as everyone’s complaining…\n\nOn non-vacuum-related issues, the Forester has one (almost) saving grace: There’s a plastic insert in the cargo area that unfolds to create nifty, organized space for grocery bags, shoes and whatever other stuff I choose to stow in its netted bins. I can fold it down easily if I need more room, which makes it incredibly handy. The unhandy thing is that when it’s closed, the hard plastic keeps anything from resting on it quietly. You can’t put anything in the trunk without at least part of it sitting on the slick plastic, so essentially everything you put in the back slides around. Totally annoying.\n\nI don’t mean to be harshin’ on the Forester so bad, but I am really quite let down by this car. I do like Subarus, and I had hoped the Forester would compensate for its dippy exterior with a nice ride for the family, but that’s not the case. My husband asks to drive most of the cars I test even though he knows he can’t, and I have to shut him down every time. He didn’t even ask to try this one. He grew up with a Turbo Hoover, too. Enough said.\n\n*For more information on the Subaru Forester and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLatch Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): None – Some\n\nSpecs\n\nBase price: $25,995\n\nPrice as tested: $26,730\n\nEngine: 2224-hp, 2.5-liter H-4\n\nFuel: 20/27 mpg\n\nLength: 176.6″\n\nWidth: 68.3″\n\nGround Clearance: 8.1″\n\nTurning Radius: 17.4′\n\nCargo space: 32.0-57.7 cu. ft.\n\nNHTSA Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal Impact\n\nDriver’s side: 5 Stars\n\nPassenger’s side: 5 Stars\n\nSide Impact\n\nFront occupant: 5 Stars\n\nRear occupant: 5 Stars\n\nRollover resistance: 4 Stars",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Subaru Forester, a successful small crossover/wagon, competes against other car-based compact crossovers including the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. It seats five people and has standard all-wheel drive.\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the base Forester 2.5X includes a new stereo with Bluetooth cellphone connectivity and audio streaming, iPod control capability, a USB port and steering-wheel controls. \nExterior\nThe Forester’s ground clearance is 8.9 inches. Fog lights are optional, and turbo versions are distinguished by a hood scoop that funnels air into the intercooler just under the hood. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard roof rails\nAvailable high-intensity-discharge headlights \nAvailable chrome exhaust tips \n16-inch wheels standard; 17-inch wheels available\nAvailable rear spoiler\n\nInterior\nThe door openings are large, and the rear window is larger than on the previous-generation Forester. A center armrest is standard for the backseat. Interior features include:\n\nStandard MP3 jack\nStandard sliding armrest \nStandard 60/40-split folding rear seats\nStandard tilt steering column (telescoping available)\n\nUnder the Hood\nForesters are powered by a choice of naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engines and either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe transmissions come with different all-wheel-drive systems. The automatic comes with Variable Torque Management, which Subaru says shifts power to the front and rear axles by monitoring throttle position, battery voltage, generator rpm, wheel speed, brake status, lateral g-force and automatic transmission fluid temperature. The manual Forester has a simple viscous coupling that’s reactive rather than proactive. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n170-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 174 pounds-feet of torque\n224-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 226 pounds-feet of torque\nHill start assist for manual-transmission models\n\nSafety\nA rollover sensor can deploy the side curtain airbags to protect occupants and prevent their ejection. Safety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for front occupants\nSide curtain airbags that protect front and backseat occupants against head injury \nActive head restraints for the front seats \nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "Looks Aren’t Everything\n2004 Subaru Forester 2.5 XT\n\nMany of us were happy in 1997 when Subaru of America introduced its Forester wagon. It seemed the perfect antidote to lust for large sport-utility vehicles — an agreeably modest offering in the midst of motorized bacchanalia.\n\nThe Forester represented good wheels. It was large enough to carry a family of five but small enough to escape the stigma of being an SUV.\n\nIt came with standard all-wheel drive, a more benign and arguably more useful form of four-wheel drive for urban and suburban motorists.\n\nAll-wheel drive automatically transfers power from slipping to gripping wheels. It is engineered to keep you on-road in rain and snow. Traditional four-wheel drive uses locking differentials to simultaneously send drive power to all four wheels. It’s designed to take you over rocks and through streams and bush — and keep you on the go.\n\nForester owners are mostly urban and suburban. Over the past six years, they’ve had few complaints about the Forester’s reliability or overall quality. But many have demanded more horsepower.\n\nThus, we have this week’s test vehicle, the 2004 Forester 2.5 XT. It is ugly, as is the case with most Subarus. But it performs beautifully. It will knock your socks off — and strip you of everything else you’re wearing, too!\n\nSubaru has installed a turbocharged, 2.5-liter, 210-horsepower engine in the Forester 2.5 XT. That’s up from 165 horsepower in the normally aspirated four-cylinder model — “normally aspirated” meaning an engine that uses no extra device, such as a turbocharger or supercharger, to take air into its combustion chambers.\n\nYou can feel the difference.\n\nThere is a certain whoosh to the 2.5 XT. Initially it is both surprising and disconcerting, especially if you’ve become accustomed to the gentle acceleration of the regular Forester. Drop the 2.5 XT’s standard four-speed automatic transmission into “drive.” Hit the accelerator and, whoosh, you’re off to Zoomsville. That’s rather odd, considering the Forester’s basic, homely personality.\n\nDespite its extra power and improved handling, the 2.5 XT pretty much remains the Forester it has been all along. It is filled with the requisite storage bins and cup holders. There is something inherently parental in its personality. The body remains an ode to all things square and rectangular, with the exception of the redesigned rear hatch, which embraces trapezoidal and triangular geometric themes.\n\nThe one indication that the 2.5 XT is different from its other Forester siblings sits atop the hood. It is a functional air scoop, put there to further assist the engine’s breathing. It seems totally out of place on and out of character for the Forester — like something a teenager would stick on his first car with little regard for taste or what looks good.\n\nThere isn’t much in the 2 .5 XT’s interior to counter that ugliness, not even in the tested version with the “Premium Package,” which includes leather seats. Subaru has yet to divorce itself from its utilitarian passion for interiors beige, black and gray. It needs to discover color and take some chances using it.\n\nHere’s hoping that Subaru’s executives might one day give to their designers and stylists the same freedom they’ve now given to their engineers, who are turning out hot-to-trot models such as the Forester 2.5 XT wagon and the very successful Impreza WRX.\n\nAfter all, most of us don’t live for power and speed alone. We sometimes stop to admire the roses, the colors of the rainbow and the deep amber glory of the setting sun.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: A general lack of imaginative styling that continues to affect Subarus, even as they become impressively potent performers on the road.\n\nPraise: You’ve got to drive the Forester 2.5 XT to believe it But I’ll wager that once you’ve driven it, you’ll become a true believer. This little wagon can move.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Ugly. Scrap the hood scoop and find another way to help deliver more air to the engine. Nobody stopped to look at this one.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: The Forester 2.5 XT is one of the best road performers in the small-wagon class. It gets top marks in all three categories. (I no longer will use the term “crossover vehicle” in describing models such as the 2.5 XT. The term is a marketing ruse, an attempt to peddle what essentially are station wagons as something else.)\n\nBody style/layout: The Forester 2.5 XT is a front-engine, all-wheel-drive, compact, four-door wagon with a rear hatch.\n\nCapacities: It sits five people. Luggage capacity with rear seats up is 32 cubic feet. Cargo capacity doubles that with rear seats down. Fuel capacity is 15.9 gallons. Premium unleaded gasoline is recommended for best performance, but regular unleaded also works fine.\n\nEngine transmission: The Forester 2.5 XT’s horizontally opposed (boxer) 2.5-liter, 16-valve, double-overhead cam, four-cylinder engine develops 210 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 235 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm. It is linked to a standard four-speed automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is available.\n\nMileage: I averaged 26 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nTechnical highlight: The 2004 Forester comes with a safety brake pedal, designed to bend forward in a severe collision. Subaru engineers say that the feature reduces the risk of injuries to feet and other lower extremities in crashes.\n\nPrice: Base price for the tested Premium Forester 2.5 XT is $27,520. Dealer’s invoice price, including the $550 destination charge, is $25,612. Your total price, including the $500 transportation fee, is $28,070.\n\nPurse-strings note: Ugly or not, it’s a buy. Compare with Audi A4, Volkswagen Jetta wagon, VW Passat wagon, Ford Escape/Mazda tribute, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.",

      "expert_review": "It’s never been the sharpest-looking crossover, inside or out, but the Subaru Forester strikes the sort of balance between driving fun, ride comfort and outright practicality that make some of its competitors seem downright frustrating in comparison.\n\nThe current, square-backed generation never blew anyone away with a progressive design or cabin quality, but its strengths become apparent as you sift through the glut of other small crossovers on the market. The five-seat crossover comes in 2.5X and 2.5XT editions — the X tells you it has a normally aspirated engine, while the XT represents a turbocharged four-cylinder. The X can be had in base, Premium, Limited and Touring trims, while the XT comes in Premium and Touring forms. All versions have standard all-wheel drive. Stack the trims up here, or compare the 2010 and 2011 Forester here. We evaluated a 2.5X Touring this time, but we’ve driven the turbocharged version in years past.\n\nBalanced Driving\nSubaru deserves praise for blending competent handling with reasonable ride comfort though that’s a relatively recent phenomenon. Go back a generation, and many Subarus handled well but they rode firmly. In contrast, this Forester sucks up uneven asphalt and spits little of it into the cabin. It’s soft over grooved pavement and potholes alike. Driven back-to-back with eight other crossovers in our $29,000 SUV Shootout, I deemed the Forester nearly as comfortable as the Ford Escape and Dodge Journey. If it weren’t for the Subaru’s incessant road and wind noise, it might lead the class.\n\nA soft ride often makes for foggy reflexes, and that holds true here: Today’s Forester doesn’t carve corners as expertly as its firm predecessor did. Given the current competition, however, it still impresses. Our test car exhibited some body roll in hard corners, but the steering tracks the course well, with satisfying weight, feedback and turn-in precision. In tight quarters, the Forester’s exemplary 34.4-foot turning circle is handy, but some may wish for more power assist at low speeds.\n\nSubaru pairs a more advanced version of its full-time all-wheel drive with the automatic transmission (a stick shift is offered on the 2.5X base and Premium), which amplifies the fun. Leave the family at home, and you can actually kick the tail out and drift this thing — a maneuver most crossovers are utterly incapable of pulling off. Well done.\n\nThough its displacement remains about the same as before, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder is new this year. Even so, it remains in the junior varsity league of acceleration. Hamstrung by a low-tech four-speed automatic, it pulls the Forester through each gear in more of an 8K relay than a 100-meter sprint. Ascend an on-ramp, and you feel 1st gear wind out ever so gracelessly, until finally handing the baton, exhausted, to 2nd. Then the climb begins anew.\n\nAt least it’s an intuitive transmission, kicking down gears on the highway with little delay. The drivetrain’s 170 horsepower rating is identical to last year’s 2.5-liter, but combined EPA gas mileage with the manual or automatic is now 23 mpg. That’s a 1-mpg improvement over last year’s drivetrains, and it’s competitive with other all-wheel-drive crossovers.\n\nThe Forester’s optional turbo four-cylinder makes 224 hp. With more low-rev torque than many V-6 competitors, the turbo moves swiftly from stoplights. The transmission only has four speeds, though, and that limits the fun. What’s more, the drivetrain requires premium fuel. That puts a real damper on its otherwise competitive 21-mpg overall rating in comparisons with V-6 crossovers.\n\nPractical Considerations\nSubaru’s full-time all-wheel drive powers all four wheels all the time, helping the crossover claw its way through muck that stops part-time all-wheel-drive systems cold. It’s only after driving other crossovers through heavy snow near our Chicago offices — or, more accurately, going nowhere at all in a few of them — that I fully appreciate the Forester’s resilience. An impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance (8.9 inches with the turbo) really helps when you’re trying to get through the deep stuff.\n\nAppreciated all year-round are the Forester’s sight lines, which are free of the descending rooflines, tiny rear-quarter windows and massive roof pillars seen elsewhere. The Forester easily won a blind-spot evaluation among small crossovers two years ago, and I’m confident it would still win against today’s competition.\n\nThe rectangular cargo area offers a modest 30.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and 63.0 cubic feet when that seat is folded down. Both figures are at the low end of the segment. Without the Forester’s headroom-robbing panoramic moonroof, the base 2.5X has a more competitive 33.5 and 68.3 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior quality has never been Subaru’s strength, and the Forester needs work. Cabin materials improve on the Escape’s industrial plastics, but other competitors — particularly the Chevy Equinox, Journey and Honda CR-V — have handsomer finishes and more appealing controls. The Forester’s feel a generation old: a crummy headliner, undersized stereo knobs and a flimsy keyfob.\n\nOur test car’s leather seats were supportive during twisty roads and highway cruising alike, but the driver’s seat needs a longer adjustment range. At 5-foot-11, I could have used another inch or two of rearward travel. Legroom and headroom in the backseat is good, but the seat could sit a bit higher off the floor — an issue that dogs many small crossovers. There’s also a footwell-robbing center floor hump in back, something many other crossovers avoid.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top scores in all evaluations, the Forester earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but received just two out of five stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s new side-impact pole ratings, which simulate a sideways encounter with a tree or telephone pole. The Forester scored better in NHTSA’s remaining evaluations, including a more conventional side-impact test, earning it an overall score of four out of five stars. Standard equipment includes the usual complement of front and side airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here to see all the Forester’s safety features.\n\nReliability for non-turbo models is exemplary; turbo models rate about average. The Forester 2.5X starts at $20,495. Given its standard all-wheel drive, that’s a steal — if you can live with a stick shift. The vast majority of shoppers will want the four-speed automatic, which runs an overpriced $1,200. Even with it, the Subaru costs roughly the same as most competing front-drive automatic crossovers.\n\nStandard features include power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control and a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack. Most trims include a panoramic moonroof and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with steering-wheel audio controls. Move up the line, and you can get a navigation system, heated leather seats and more. Turbo models start just under $27,000 and top out around $31,500. That’s relatively modest, given many competitors can spiral well into the mid-30s.\n\nForester in the Market\nSubaru’s insistence on standard all-wheel drive, and its associated cost, will keep the Forester from ever topping segment sales lists. To its credit, the automaker has reduced the pricing and gas mileage penalty associated with all-wheel drive better than most. But the front-drive competition is likely to remain a little cheaper or a little more fuel efficient, and if you live in Florida or Texas, that math alone may keep you from ever visiting a Subaru dealership.\n\nThat said, the Forester’s future looks bright. Look at any segment of cars, and the sharpest ones are usually those introduced or redesigned most recently. The Forester’s mastery of the fundamentals is harder to beat, and that should keep it running strong all the way through this generation’s final years.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "My friend Ralph used to be the ice cream maker at a famous North Shore candy house and ice cream parlor.\n\nEvery time I’d tell him about a new favorite dairy bar – for example, the one on the UConn campus in Storrs, Conn. – he’d ignore my ravings about the Jonathan Supreme and Husky Tracks.\n\n“Tell me about the vanilla,” he’d say.\n\n“The vanilla? They’ve got all these great flavors.”\n\n“I always try the vanilla first,” was his answer. “That’s the most important and the hardest to get right.”\n\nThose words often come back to me.\n\nWe were looking at this week’s test car – a 2009 Subaru Forester. It’s the base X model equipped with the premium and all-weather packages. Those bumped the $19,995 base price to $24,590.\n\nThat’s well-equipped, though you can opt for more, starting with the entire XT line which adds a turbocharger, boosting the basic 4-cylinder boxer engine’s horsepower from 170 to 224. Ours had Subaru’s tried-and-true four-speed automatic, a bit of an anachronism when others are going to five- and six-speed units but one that’s been a workhorse. A five-speed may have improved fuel economy, though that’s traditionally been a weak point of the boxer engine and AWD system.\n\nIt’s rated at 20 miles per gallon city and 26 highway. The on-board computer, which included previous drivers’ information, read that it’d been averaging 24.5.\n\nStill, Mrs. G said, “It’s really comfortable, but it looks bland.”\n\n“Vanilla?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, you know what Ralph always said about vanilla.”\n\nNew Englanders always have embraced the all-wheel-drive Subarus. We’ve all heard the jokes about the Subaru being the State Car of Vermont.\n\nThe new version is longer and higher than its predecessors (aren’t all new models?). The goal was aimed at going more SUV mainstream. It appears that was a good move, especially given the downturn for large SUV sales and the all-around capability of the Subaru from the full-time AWD and carrying ability. In addition, sales people could note the increased ground clearance – up to 8.7 inches.\n\nEarly returns indicate that’s happening. March Forester sales were up 47 percent over 2008 and first-quarter sales are up 80 percent over the same period a year ago.\n\nSubaru’s niche, to me, remains more “raised wagon” than full SUV. That gives drivers a raised seating position, something I’ve never heard anyone complain about. The seats were comfortable on longer stretches but maintain one of Subaru’s quirky characteristics: an odd pattern in the cloth fabric. A positive was that Subaru offers a heated option with the cloth seats, not forcing you to opt for leather to have butt warmers.\n\nRide was middle-of-the-road comfortable, a trade-off for the ground clearance and high driving position. The handling is far from stiff but predictable enough with a reworked double wishbone rear suspension. The added length (three inches) helps with rear legroom and cargo space. The cargo area can be expanded by lowering the 60/40 rear seats.\n\nWe found our obligatory auxiliary plug for an MP3 player and also three 12-volt outlets (one in the dash, one in the console, the third in the cargo area) for necessary charging.\n\nAll controls were intuitive. Yes. You can sit in the driver’s seat for the first time and not have to turn to the salesman or owner’s manual to find out “how to.”\n\nOverhead, the premium package doesn’t merely add a sunroof. Instead, it’s a massive (Subaru calls it panoramic) sunroof. Hit the switch and it opens fully — unless you’ve left a coffee cup on it, then it somehow stops just before dumping it on the rear seats. (Speaking of coffee cups, the cup holders in the center console were a pair of square boxes that didn’t secure my coffee mug.)\n\nDuring shopping trips, the rear tailgate was easy to lift, opened high enough so a six-footer didn’t whack his head, and was easy to close. That’s an engineering tripleheader – and another reason why Subaru’s vanilla is a “good vanilla.”",
