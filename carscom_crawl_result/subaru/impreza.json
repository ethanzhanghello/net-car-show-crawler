      "expert_review": "The five-door Subaru Impreza hatchback receives some updates to its RS trim’s powertrain for the 2026 model year, as well as a new Citron Yellow Pearl paint color and updates to its safety tech. The sixth-generation Impreza is available in two trim levels, Sport and RS; the base trim level has been discontinued for the new model year. The 2026 Impreza will start at $27,790 (all prices include $1,195 destination fee).\n\nRelated: 2024 Subaru Impreza Review: Safe, Practical and a Dash of Fun\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Impreza will arrive at dealerships this fall. Pricing for the hatchback is as follows:\n\nSport: $27,790\nRS: $30,690\nTrim Levels\n\nThe Impreza Sport is equipped with a 2.0-liter boxer four-cylinder engine that produces 152 horsepower and 145 pounds-feet of torque; it’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission, but an eight-speed manual mode can be activated via the vehicle’s steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.\n\nAlso included is an 11.6-inch touchscreen multimedia system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Sport trim drives on 18-inch dark-gray alloy wheels and is equipped with LED foglights, steering-responsive headlights and two drive modes: Intelligent, which provides eco-friendly driving settings, and Sport. It also comes standard with the EyeSight driver-assistance suite, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Cars equipped with the optional $1,900 package that includes blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, evasive steering and a power moonroof now also come with emergency lane keep assist.\n\nThe Impreza RS was not changed for 2025 after being introduced in 2024, but it is updated for 2026. Most notably, the RS receives an updated 2.5-liter boxer four-cylinder engine making 180 hp and 178 pounds-feet of torque; it makes more torque at a lower rpm, though horsepower is slightly down from the 2025 model’s RS trim.\n\nThe RS comes standard with the $1,900 options package offered on the Sport and offers unique interior trim accents in gunmetal and simulated carbon fiber, as well as sport front seats in black cloth with red accents and aluminum-alloy pedal covers. The shifter and steering wheel are also wrapped in leather. It also offers RS badging on the front doors and rear hatch, 18-inch dark-gray alloy wheels, upgraded LED headlights, and a black finish on the grille, side spoilers and mirrors. The RS is available with an optional $2,070 package that includes a 10-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with a 432-watt amplifier, a power moonroof and a 10-way power-adjustable front seat with lumbar support.\n\nRead More About the Subaru Impreza:\n\nIs the 2024 Subaru Impreza a Good Car? 5 Pros, 4 Cons\n2024 Subaru Impreza, Crosstrek Earn IIHS Safety Awards\nWho Makes Subaru?\nResearch the Subaru Impreza\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2024 Subaru Impreza delivers a desirable mix of safety, practicality and fun for under $30,000 in its new RS trim level.\n\nVersus the competition: While the new Impreza RS may not be the most engaging car to drive in its class, it might be one of the most well rounded.\n\nThe new 2024 Subaru Impreza is notable not only for what it now includes — an available big-screen multimedia system, updated safety features, and a larger and more powerful engine in the top RS trim level — but also for what it doesn’t. Both the sedan body style and manual transmission have been axed, streamlining the 2024 Impreza lineup; it’s now available only as a four-door hatchback with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The downside is that this is a pricier configuration, so there are fewer affordable versions of the Impreza for 2024: Pricing now starts at $24,115 (all prices include destination), which is up $3,300 from a base 2023 Impreza sedan, and it’s $1,400 more than a comparable 2023 Impreza hatchback.\n\nRelated: Subaru Announces 2024 Impreza Pricing, Starts at $24,085\n\nFor this review, I drove a top-trim 2024 Impreza RS priced at $28,975. There aren’t many all-wheel-drive hatchbacks less than $30,000 on the market that aren’t trying to be SUVs (like the Impreza’s more expensive Crosstrek sibling), but does the 2024 Impreza — even with its higher pricing — make sense considering there are plenty of AWD vehicles available under $30,000 that aren’t Subarus?\n\nReturn of the Impreza RS\n\nThe Impreza RS is a throwback name that’s returning for 2024, and the trim it’s applied to gets a more powerful engine and a few appearance add-ons; it now sits atop the Impreza lineup as the non-WRX enthusiast version. The differences are minor as far as appearance goes, with just some slight variations in color versus the middle Sport trim. It took a close inspection of side-by-side photos to spot the differences, which include 18-inch alloy wheels that are painted dark gray, black-painted side cladding and side mirrors, and upgraded LED headlights and foglights.\n\nThe most notable differentiator for the RS is under the hood. This version is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 182 horsepower, up 30 hp from the 152-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder found in the Base and Sport trim levels.\n\nOn the inside, the RS features gunmetal and simulated carbon-fiber trim highlights, sport seats with red cloth bolsters, and carpeted floormats with an RS logo. Also differentiating the interior is a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear selector, plus aluminum-alloy pedals. The RS comes standard with blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert, while an option package adds a power moonroof, 10-way power driver’s seat and upgraded 10-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, the latter two being unique to the RS.\n\nAcceleration and MPG\n\nThe 30-hp jump over the Impreza’s base engine is a notable increase for the RS, and while the 2.5-liter engine offers spirited acceleration, the accelerator pedal needs a fair amount of prodding to get results; the continuously variable automatic transmission isn’t eager to spin up the engine until you’ve really put the pedal to the floor. There are two drive modes, Sport (S) and Intelligent (I), that change how quickly the engine reacts, but neither mode breathes much excitement into the driving experience — nor does the transmission’s manual-shift mode, which simulates fixed-gear changes. Given the poky nature of the base 2.0-liter, the 2.5-liter engine is more of a functional improvement in acceleration than an engine that sounds or accelerates in a rewarding way when you give it the beans. For those looking for more driving engagement, check out an AWD Mazda3 hatchback, which pairs similar power and a pleasant soundtrack with a crisp, responsive six-speed automatic.\n\nEven with more power and larger displacement, the Impreza RS’ 2.5-liter four-cylinder is EPA-rated only 1 mpg lower in city/highway/combined driving versus the base engine; it’s rated 26/33/29 mpg versus the 2.0-liter’s 27/34/30 mpg rating. Versus a Mazda3 hatchback with AWD, the Impreza RS doesn’t offer any advantage in EPA-rated fuel economy; the Mazda earned the same 26/33/29 mpg rating. The Impreza RS likewise isn’t any more efficient than the off-road-oriented Crosstrek, which also earns an EPA-estimated 26/33/29 mpg when fitted with the same engine. One interesting tidbit about the 2024 Impreza is that its gas tank has been increased from 13.2 to 16.6 gallons; that’s good for an additional 89 miles of EPA-rated range for the 2.0-liter — up to 498 miles from the 2023 Impreza’s 409 miles — while the RS with the 2.5-liter has a driving range of 481 miles.\n\nComfort\n\nThe Impreza is a comfortable car to drive. Forward visibility is great thanks to its thin front roof pillars, a low hoodline and lots of glass, including front quarter windows that supply extra visibility. Rear visibility, however, isn’t great because of its sloping hatchback roofline, but that’s normal for this body style.\n\nThe 2024 Impreza’s standard six-way, manually adjustable driver’s seat has been redesigned, and it’s especially comfortable — which is something that can’t be said for many inexpensive small cars. My slender 6-foot-tall frame and toddler-worn lower back appreciated the well-cushioned seatback. Because the Impreza and Crosstrek are so closely related, there’s no difference in cabin space and roominess between the two. The Impreza’s backseat is roomy and comfortable, with similar cushioning to the front. That can’t be said of the Mazda3’s backseat.\n\nWhile the Impreza might not be the best fit as your only family vehicle if you have multiple kids, it certainly merits consideration as a second car to a three-row SUV or minivan for occasional use; it handled my two young kids — one in a forward-facing convertible seat and the other in a high-back booster — very well. Those who put kids in the back should note, however, that there are no climate vents in the rear of the center console for extra airflow to backseat riders. It’s an unfortunate oversight considering how accommodating the backseat is otherwise.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe Impreza RS shares its sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels and tires with the middle Sport trim level, so the handling experience isn’t elevated over the middle trim. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, because its ride and handling is sophisticated and well balanced, if a bit on the firmer side versus its Crosstrek sibling. Still, it’s not a low-quality experience because larger bumps don’t send large shocks through the car, and it isn’t easily upset while cornering. It has a quality feel that’s appropriate for a small car with 18-inch wheels that’s aiming to be sporty.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t call the RS engaging or eager to dive into corners like a Mazda3, the Impreza RS is certainly spirited when you take a corner with vigor. It’s a fine compromise considering how roomy and comfortable the Impreza is versus the more confining Mazda3 hatchback. And versus a Crosstrek, the Impreza is certainly more carlike in how confident, flat and composed it drives.\n\nI drove the Impreza RS in colder temperatures with wet leaves on the ground. Those are conditions that make many cars — even some AWD ones — struggle for traction, but the Impreza didn’t flinch. It performed admirably even when I tried to trip up Subaru’s standard AWD system. The automaker revised the system’s front-to-rear torque split for 2024 to improve responsiveness.\n\nSubaru also made some improvements to combat interior noise in the Impreza, but wind and engine noise remain elevated versus many of its competitors. Road noise, however, is well managed, so the Impreza is quiet and pleasant at lower vehicle and engine speeds. It doesn’t start to get loud and annoying until the engine is wrung out for acceleration or you’re traveling at highway speeds, where wind noise takes over as the predominant sound intrusion.\n\nRelated Video:  \n\nMultimedia\n\nThe Impreza’s standard multimedia and control system employs an interesting layout, with dual 7-inch touchscreens. The top one is used for the multimedia system and the bottom for climate and vehicle controls. We haven’t sampled this configuration yet, but it’s a unique layout that also includes some physical controls for volume, audio tuning and cabin temperature. The RS, meanwhile, comes standard with a single 11.6-inch vertically oriented touchscreen in one of the better executions of this style, with seat heater and climate temperature functions that have physical controls separate from the digital display. We prefer physical controls for these types of systems because screens can have inconsistencies in responsiveness and operation that create user-interface problems.\n\nI did, however, encounter some oddities with this system. Even though my phone was the only one paired, and was registered as a favorite, wireless Apple CarPlay wasn’t always recognized when starting up in the morning, meaning I had to go into the menu and select my phone. Normally, it’s hard to nail down these connectivity issues because of how finicky cars and phones can be, but this has been a recurring issue with the past few Subarus we’ve tested, with wireless Apple CarPlay only intermittently connecting. Also, I’d just gotten out of another test car where wireless CarPlay worked flawlessly for a week.\n\nWhen CarPlay does work in the Impreza, it works well, and overall, I prefer Subaru’s new layout versus the old setup, which had an information display mounted atop the dashboard. Some of the information from that display now shows up on the instrument panel readout, where it’s more easily accessible.\n\nCargo Space\n\nWe measured 13.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat of the Impreza, which is a touch more than the Crosstrek’s 12.7 cubic feet. It’s slightly bigger for an unfortunate but common reason: Unlike the Crosstrek, the Impreza has no spare tire, just a tire repair kit with sealant and an air compressor. The repair kit is fitted to a foam insert under the cargo floor that also includes a small storage cubby, which is where the extra space comes from. I suspect anyone stranded on the side of the road with a gash in their tire would prefer an actual spare tire over the additional 0.6 cubic foot of cargo space created by not having one. Adding insult to injury, the tires fitted to the RS were not run-flats, which maintain performance for a certain distance without air pressure; it’s equipped with traditional tires.\n\nSafety\n\nWhile the 2024 Subaru Impreza initially earned an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick+ designation, the agency’s updated 2024 methodology has more challenging criteria in its moderate overlap crash test, so the Impreza only earned a Top Safety Pick in 2024 testing. The 2024 Impreza remains an improvement over the 2023, however, with better performances in side crash test and headlights. There’s also an updated version of Subaru’s EyeSight suite of driver-assistance technology, including improved automatic braking performance, an additional camera, and an enhanced camera with a wider field of view.\n\nPricing and Value\n\nDespite there not being many direct competitors to the Impreza, there’s no shortage of AWD vehicles under $30,000 on the market, including the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Honda HR-V, Kia Seltos, Toyota Corolla Cross, Volkswagen Taos and more. Simply offering affordable AWD isn’t enough for the Impreza, but what it delivers in its RS version for 2024 is a desirable mix of safety, practicality and fun for under $30,000, and it’s certainly an improvement over the 2023 Impreza.\n\nThe biggest threat to the new Impreza’s success might come from within Subaru itself: If you’re not looking for a ground-hugging, carlike ride, the Crosstrek has advantages over its sibling in ride quality, and you get that spare tire — all with no fuel-economy penalty. What’s more, the Crosstrek, like many small SUVs, has a slightly raised seating position that makes it easier to get in and out. You’ll have to pony up, however, because the Crosstrek’s base price is $2,200 more than the Impreza’s. If you don’t need those qualities from the Crosstrek, you can save a decent amount of coin and get much the same experience from the Impreza.\n\nAs for the RS, it certainly has a place in the Impreza lineup, but calling it an “enthusiast-focused trim level,” as Subaru does, might be a bit of an overpromise — unless we’re talking about hatchback enthusiasts. The Impreza RS is best viewed simply as a top trim level that brings improved acceleration, not as a particularly sporty or enthusiast-oriented trim. It’s quite a ways off from the most engaging-to-drive cars in its class even though it might be one of the most well rounded.\n\nEditor’s note: This article was updated on June 18, 2024, to reflect the 2024 Subaru Impreza’s crash-test scores in the more stringent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash-test methodology.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2024 Subaru Impreza: Hatchbacks Are More Fun\n2024 Subaru Impreza, Crosstrek Earn IIHS Safety Awards\n2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness Up Close: Into the Wild\nWhat’s the Best Affordable SUV of 2023?\nShop for a 2024 Subaru Impreza\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nThe Impreza RS is meant to be a sporty version of Subaru’s compact four-door hatchback, equipped with a more powerful engine and racier trim.\nIn reality, the Impreza RS is more comfortable than sporty, with a soft-riding suspension, unhurried acceleration, cushy seats and plenty of room for five people.\nAn updated multimedia system is sorely needed, but the Impreza RS offers significant value as a comfortable, efficient and spacious hatch with a splash of sporty looks.\n\nI’m not used to driving new cars these days. A seemingly endless parade of new SUVs and pickup trucks has graced my driveway for some time, but actual cars are a rarity unless they’re high-performance, high-dollar specialty ones. Budget-friendly compact hatchbacks are a dying breed, with just a handful left on the market. One of those is the 2025 Subaru Impreza RS, along with more traditional compact hatchback choices like the Kia K4, Mazda3, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and … that’s it. The Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze, base Volkswagen Golf and Hyundai Elantra GT are all long gone. These days, the Impreza is offered solely as a hatchback; the Impreza sedan was discontinued with the car’s 2024-model-year redesign. \n\nRelated: Research the 2025 Subaru Impreza\n\nHow Much Does a Subaru Impreza Cost?\n\nThe 2025 Impreza comes in three trims (base, Sport and RS), but Subaru also sells variants of it in the form of its off-road-oriented Crosstrek and performance-oriented WRX models. \n\nThe base trim has been dropped for 2026, leaving the Sport as the entry-level model. Prices listed below are for the 2026 Impreza, which isn’t materially different from the 2025 model reviewed here, and include a $1,195 destination fee: \n\nSport: $27,790\nRS: $30,690\n\nBoth the Sport and RS are billed by Subaru as sport-oriented trims, with the big difference between them being the engine: The Sport uses a 152-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while the RS gets a bigger, 182-hp four-cylinder. My test car was an RS — a name that used to imply some additional sporting ability in a package not quite as rally-ready as the WRX. The reality of this RS, however, is rather different. But does that make it less appealing? Or any less successful in its mission?\n\nLooking the Part\n\nVisually, moving from the Sport to the RS brings a few more spiffs. Both models have standard 18-inch wheels, but the RS trim’s are a different style and painted dark gray. RS badging is present on the front doors and rear hatch, while the grille, side sills and mirror caps are blacked out. But the rest of its looks aren’t all that different from the Sport trim. It still flies under the radar … or it would have if not for the fire-engine red paint my test vehicle came in. \n\nOverall, it’s familiar. With its 2024 redesign, the Impreza’s styling didn’t stray too far from its predecessor’s; it’s an inoffensive, unremarkable look that will be easy to swallow both for Subaru fans and folks just looking for solid, unpretentious, practical transportation. It looks sporty enough to evoke the spirit of Subaru’s faster, more capable WRX, but given the WRX is no longer available as a hatchback and the Impreza can’t be had as a sedan, nobody is likely to confuse the two.\n\nQuick Enough, Sportyish\n\nThe RS’ 2.5-liter flat-four-cylinder engine (also known as a “boxer” configuration because of how the pistons are arranged) makes 182 hp and 178 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission with software meant to emulate an eight-speed paddle-shift automatic, meaning you can blip paddles on the steering wheel to pretend you’re changing gears. You’ll do it once for the novelty, then likely never again; both the idea and execution of using paddle shifters to shift gears in a transmission that doesn’t have any gears feels just as barmy as it sounds. The car knows best how the CVT should behave; even its Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much. \n\nOverall, acceleration in the RS is acceptable but by no means athletic. Standard all-wheel drive is a nice touch for this class, but it doesn’t help in spirited driving as much as it would in inclement weather. Fuel economy is acceptable, at an EPA-rated 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined for the RS. My observed gas mileage of 28 mpg for the week was close to that combined rating. \n\nThe RS’ ride quality is extraordinarily plush, making it feel like a much bigger, more substantial vehicle than it actually is. Its handling characteristics are equally soft, with steering that’s slow and lacks feedback — it doesn’t really encourage you to invite the RS to dance on your favorite back road. There’s pronounced body roll in corners, as well, given the suspension is tuned more for comfort than for a firmer, sporty ride. This is not a VW Golf GTI fighter, by any means. Braking behavior, body control, ride and handling balance — all of it feels tuned to provide a posh, comfortable, nonpunishing driving experience without unleashing too much adrenaline in any of the car’s passengers. That feels at odds with the idea of the RS — especially historically. It’s always been billed as a slightly less capable (and less expensive) midway point between the basic Impreza and the decidedly sporting WRX. Compared with something like the Honda Civic Si, though, the Impreza RS skews far more toward comfort than does that historically sporty compact car.\n\nMore Cushioning Inside\n\nSubaru’s changes to the RS interior include adding dark cloth upholstery with red accents. The seats are softer, too, with more cushioning than you’ll find in many compact cars. While they’re incredibly comfortable, they don’t provide much in the way of bolstering when you start getting frisky in corners, which is another ding against the RS actually being a sporty compact. It looks pretty good inside, however, with gunmetal and faux carbon-fiber trim, floormats with the RS logo, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, and aluminum pedals. The driver’s seat in the RS can have optional 10-way power adjustments with lumbar support, which is an upgrade over the Sport trim. Heated front seats are standard in the RS.\n\nBut there’s still a lot that doesn’t come even in the RS trim, as evidenced by the multitude of blanked-out controls all over the dash and console, reminding you of options that either you didn’t specify or Subaru doesn’t make available. That aside, it’s a decently crafted cabin that feels appropriate for the Impreza RS’ price tag. And comfort is undeniable both in the two highly cushioned, soft seats up front and in the backseat, which can seat three people but is more pleasant with just two. Headroom and legroom abound up front and in back, with the optional power moonroof not really affecting passenger headspace. Thanks to the Impreza’s hatchback style, cargo room is plentiful — even more so when the backseats are folded flat, opening up a cavernous space to haul things. \n\nTerrible Tech Remains\n\nAlas, whatever praise I have for the interior of the new Impreza RS ends when we start talking about its technology and electronics, which feel dated, slow and in desperate need of updating. The vertically oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system feels ancient; it needs to go away for good with the next Impreza. Integrating the climate controls into this ponderously slow piece of tech was an error that Subaru has rectified in the redesigned 2026 Outback, so we have hope for future Imprezas, too. The current system not only lags noticeably between screens and functions, it disappears in bright sunlight and feels outclassed and surpassed by nearly every other automaker’s multimedia technology. \n\nThe gauge cluster is similarly dated. It’s easy to read, with two round gauges flanking a small digital display, but it also feels old and uninteresting compared with the latest digital offerings from Kia and even Honda. Similarly, while the Impreza’s interior is comfortable, spacious, well built and blessed with acceptable materials quality, it also seems old — which is curious given this car’s recent redesign. \n\nValue-Conscious Transportation Is Alive\n\nDespite Subaru’s attempt to bill the Impreza RS as a sporty hatchback for folks unwilling to go all the way with a WRX, the reality of the vehicle is that it’s more of a value-conscious, well-appointed, comfortable and spacious all-arounder with a dash of sporty good looks. It won’t hold up against the demi-sporty offerings from Honda or Kia, though, as it has little of the vim and vigor of a Civic Si or K4 GT-Line Turbo and none of the handling prowess of a Mazda3 hatchback. \n\nBut with an as-tested price of just about $32,000, the Impreza RS represents a very solid value in a disappearing class. For those who face inclement weather and need to carry multiple people but don’t need a big SUV, it’s a fantastic option — maneuverable, comfortable and useful, making it a solid choice for all-around transportation. Thrill-seekers who don’t mind the sedan body style should step up to the WRX — or if they want a hatch, they can hop over to a VW dealer for a new Golf GTI. Drivers looking for more flash than dash, however, will be pleased with this Impreza RS. \n\nMore Subaru News From Cars.com: \n\nWhat Does the 2026 Subaru Outback’s Pricing Mean for Shoppers?\n2026 Subaru WRX, BRZ Sting With Special Series.Yellow Editions\nMore Powerful, Longer-Range 2026 Subaru Solterra Priced From $39,945\nIs the Subaru WRX TR a Good Car? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Much Is the 2026 Subaru Ascent?\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It seems as though everybody is getting into the “sport” vehicle business these days.\n\nSubaru, not to be left on the starting grid, joins the fray with a 1997 Impreza Outback Sport Wagon.\n\nAs Subaru’s newest offering in the sport-wagon class, this vehicle comes with some different marketing goals in mind and some different design features.\n\n“They are going after a little more active person,” said Ron Vanags, vice president and general manager of Speedway Subaru. “It’s designed for younger people who want something like a car but still want the utility of a van or truck with all-wheel drive.”\n\nOn the design front, the biggest difference is Subaru’s horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine\n\nSubaru was a pioneer on the American market about 25 years ago with a wagon that used a horizontally opposed “boxer” type engine that functioned in conjunction with four-wheel drive. The concept is retained today, but in a much more sophisticated form.\n\nSubaru’s all-wheel drive and flat-4 are standard fare for the Outback Sport, and gives the wagon all-season-go- anywhere capabilities.\n\nThe Sport has received new exterior styling cues, new interior styling, more power for improved performance, and a new 12-volt power cargo outlet.\n\nThe Sport is based upon a shortened Subaru Legacy chassis. Engineering dropped the wheelbase from the Legacy’s 103.5 inches down to 99.2 inches. Overall length has been shortened to 172.2 inches from the Legacy Wagon’s 185.8 inches.\n\nThis knocks off more than 300 pounds from the Legacy chassis, with the Sport weighing in at 2,835 pounds in five- speed manual transmission form. If you want an automatic, the weight goes up to 2,9l5 pounds.\n\nThis lighter weight produces some performance pizzaz, with the vehicle’s 2.2-liter (136-cubic-inch) flat-4 developing 137- horsepower and 145 foot-pound of torque. The single overhead cam, 16-valve, boxer-style engine has its own gutty little roar, letting you know that it’s ready to zip through the snow or up the side of the mountain.\n\nHow quickly you want to zip depends upon whether you’re running a manual gearbox or an automatic. Of interest is that, while most everything today is going automatic, Subaru’s five-speed is still finding favor.\n\n“I’d say it’s just about 50/50,” Vanags said.\n\nI’d say the automatic will be a little easier to drive in hazardous going. The Sport will be a hard vehicle to bog down, for its standard equipment is 205/60 SR 15 all-season radial tires and 6-by-15-inch wheels. This 15-inch rubber gets a good bite on slippery surfaces to keep everything moving forward.\n\nGenerally speaking, wagons come in all forms and shapes. It is not easy to style aerodynamic lines around a compact vehicle without sacrificing interior space.\n\nOn balance, I would say the Sport represents a pretty slick styling job. A new front hood, hood scoop, grille, bumper and spoiler create curving frontal lines that blend in with the rear end.\n\nBearing an EPA classification of small statio n wagon, the Sport is a five-passenger vehicle that has a respectable 43.1 inches of legroom in front. Like all small vehicles on a short wheelbase, rear seat legroom is somewhat restricted. It has 32.4 inches available in the back, and the cabin space offers 85 cubic feet of passenger volume.\n\nFor a compact, the Sport has a wide range of standard support equipment and convenience items, like air, stereo, power accessories, defoggers, tilt steering column, intermittent front and rear wipers, a vanity mirror, storage bins, cup holders, and dual airbags.\n\nOptions are limited to a CD player, cruise control, alloy wheels and a rear spoiler.\n\nAll this is generally the province of some fairly expensive automobiles, but with the Sport, it’s included in the five-speed $17,995 sticker price. The automatic increases the price by $800.",

      "expert_review": "Our memories of the 1998 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS are golden – in fact, distressingly so.\n\nThe Japanese sporty subcompact stands out in the under-$20,000 class largely because of its gaudy 16-inch gold-color alloy wheels and ground effects bodywork, both of which are guaranteed to get you noticed. The question is, do you want or need all that attention? Because Subaru figured that buyers of the wild Impreza are likely to beat it pretty well, they thoughtfully included features like stone-guard coating and splash guards. The 2.5 RS is the newest member of the Impreza family.\n\nPaul, still in the throes of an adolescent mentality, loved it. Anita would rather own a Neon.\n\nHe: When I was a kid, one of my favorite local TV heroes was Ricky the Clown. In fact, I had a dream the other night that Ricky gave me a ride in his new car. Funny, I think it was an Impreza 2.5 RS.\n\nShe: I’ve been married to you too long. I know all your little secrets, including the fact that you threw up during a taping of Ricky’s show way back in kindergarten. I, however, felt like throwing up when I was forced to test drive the Impreza 2.5 RS. My two enduring memories of the car: Parking it way down the street so my neighbors wouldn’t suspect it was mine. And a 10-year-old boy chasing me out of the grocery store and asking me ‘Hey, lady – what’s that car? Huh?”\n\nHe: Was his name Ricky?\n\nShe: No, Paul.\n\nHe: Get serious. If you can just get past the goofy wheels, the add-on plastic trim and the extremely tacky-looking hood scoop and louvers, the 2.5 RS is actually a pretty wonderful car. There aren’t many subcompacts for under $20,000 that feature all-independent sport suspension, four-wheel disc brakes with antilock, variable assist power steering and 16-inch all-season radials. And that’s before you factor in one of the most powerful engines in the class, a 165-horsepower, twin-cam 2.5-liter, and what I think is really the key selling feature – full-time four-wheel drive.\n\nShe: So you’re saying the Subaru is kind of like a clown with an MBA. Frothy on the outside, but serious on the inside.\n\nHe: That wasn’t exactly the metaphor that leaped to mind.\n\nShe: It just seemed so impractical. Yes, you get lots of standard equipment, but the driver’s side didn’t even have a cheap unlighted vanity mirror. It had nothing. And I can’t get past the rather steep price tag of $20,756 on our test car once you added extras like a $420 CD player and $225 keyless entry. If one of my boys was shopping in this segment, I’d advise against such an excessive and showy purchase. You can get a nicely equipped Neon coupe for under $15,000 or an Acura Integra for under $17,000. And I would argue that both of those cars have a sporty flair and enough personality for even a motorhead.\n\nHe: Let’s backtrack a sec. As far as the standard equipment goes, we’re talking stuff like air conditioning, a power sunroof, and an 80-watt AM/FM stereo wit h cassette. I think I personally could live without the driver’s vanity mirror. Equipment aside, I would definitely take the 2.5 RS over the Neon in a heartbeat because it’s so much more fun to drive and it simply feels like a better car. It’s extremely quick and nimble – a real joy to toss around, even if you’re just running around the neighborhood.\n\nShe: I had a few problems with it running around the neighborhood. For example, the huge rear spoiler interferes with your vision out of the rear window. I hated that. Also, I had trouble shifting it. I would rather have the optional automatic transmission, but that costs an extra $800. In fairness, I would own the Impreza if I could strip off all that tacky stuff and start from scratch.\n\nHe: Why don’t you offer Subaru an extra $1,000 to peel off all the plastic and repaint the wheels? Of course, Ricky will probably lose all interest then. Without all the gimmicky body work, what you’re really looking at is more of a garden-variety Impreza, along the lines of the little Outback Sport, and I think even younger buyers see that as more of a family vehicle. There must be a happy medium there somewhere.\n\nShe: I don’t think younger buyers – especially younger female buyers – are going to lust after the 2.5 RS. They are into looking more sophisticated. Just talk to them. They like slinky black dresses with a touch of Spandex. They smoke. They read Cosmo. How many of them really want to look or act like Jenny McCarthy from MTV? Now there’s a girl I can picture in a 2.5 RS.\n\nHe: I’d definitely pay extra for that option. But the bigger question is why Subaru chose to introduce this model in ’98. I suspect someone at the parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, was totally enamored with the Subaru world rally car and decided all that race-car junk would look great on a production model. Wrong.\n\nShe: The interior isn’t even all that comfortable. The front bucket seats have pretty aggressive bolsters that almost feel a little too snug. Some of the controls on the instrument panel are raked at an angle and it makes them it bit hard to decipher – and really hard to work with, especially if you’re wearing gloves. Some of the more tasteful touches include a black leather steering wheel and leather shift knob. And on the plus side, the trunk is quite roomy for a subcompact.\n\nHe: So who would want to buy an Impreza 2.5 RS?\n\nShe: I can picture him. He’s in every high school yearbook. They call him the class clown.\n\n1998 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger coupe\n\nPrice: Base, $19,195; as tested, $20,756 (inc. $495 destination charge)\n\nWhat’s new for ’98: New model for ’98\n\nStandard equipment: Four-wheel disc brakes, sport suspension, variable-assist power steering, gold alloy wheels, power sunroof, hood scoop and vents, ground-effects bodywork, rear spoiler, power mirrors, tinted glass, rear defogger, splash guards, stone guard coating, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, map lights, intermittent wipers, air conditioning, power door locks, remote trunk release, 80-watt AM-FM stereo cassette, power windows, 12-volt power outlet, tilt steering column\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, antilock brakes, height-adjustable front seat belts\n\nOptions on test vehicle: CD player ($420); cruise control ($357); keyless entry ($225); floor mats ($64)\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter O-4; 165-hp at 5600 rpm; 162 lb-ft torque at 4000 rpm\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual\n\nCompetitors: Acura Integra, Chevrolet Cavalier, Dodge/Plymouth Neon, Eagle Talon, Ford Probe, Honda Civic, Hyundai Tiburon, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Nissan 200SX, Pontiac Sunfire, Saturn SC, Toyota Celica.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 99.2 inches; overall length, 172.2 inches; curb weight, 2825 pounds; legroom, 43.1 inches front/32.5 inches rear; headroom, 39.2 inches front/36.7 inches rear; shoulder room, 53.0 inches front/52.4 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,083\n\nRates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.\n\nWhere built: Yajima, Japan",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Subaru Impreza. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nUpgraded with a rich new multimedia system and higher gas mileage, the 2015 Subaru Impreza is a serious contender for all small-car shoppers, even if you don’t think you need all-wheel drive.\n\nChanges for 2015 include some visual tweaks and an overhauled, smartphone-quality dashboard display, which even the base Impreza gets in scaled-down form. As before, the car comes as a sedan or four-door hatchback in 2.0i base, Premium and Limited trim levels; the hatchback also gets Sport Premium and Sport Limited grades. Compare the trims here or stack up the 2014 and 2015 Impreza here. If you’re looking for the related XV Crosstrek, WRX or WRX STI, we cover them on separate pages in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nExterior & Styling\nReshaped bumper openings with bisecting chrome spears grace all trim levels, including our Impreza 2.0 Limited sedan. It’s a dressier appearance I appreciate most on the base and Premium versions; last year’s car just had formless black pits that shouted: “Fog lights should go here!”\n\nFrom the side or rear, the 2015 Impreza is essentially unchanged. Hatchback versions are 6.5 inches shorter in length than the sedan, though both cars share the same tidy 34.8-inch turning circle. Fifteen-inch steel wheels are standard, and 16- or 17-inch alloys are optional.\n\nHow It Drives\nDespite Subaru’s claims of more insulation for 2015, the Impreza remains noisy. Wind noise is significant at highway speeds, even for this class. Dig into the gas pedal and the Impreza’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder emits a wheezy, mechanical whine as the tach needle swings upward. Our test car also exhibited a peculiar whine at low speeds that didn’t correlate to engine load and disappeared above 10 mph or so. It may have come from the Yokohama Avid S34 P205/50R17 tires, so keep an ear out on your test drive.\n\nThe drivetrain itself has adequate power, with sufficient torque and peppy response at lower speeds after an initial moment of accelerator lag. Passing at any speed requires most of the engine’s reserves, but power was adequate even with four adults aboard. The continuously variable automatic transmission is unobtrusive enough to be mistaken for a conventional automatic. Push it hard and it behaves as such, holding a ratio, revving higher and then dropping to the next “gear.” It’s all contrived, of course, as CVTs lack fixed gears, but it mitigates the single biggest annoyance of these transmissions: the rubber-band sensation of disconnect between how much gas you give and how much you hear the engine rev.\n\nGiven the standard all-wheel drive, gas mileage is rated an outstanding 31 mpg combined with the CVT. That’s up 1 mpg this year, and it’s competitive with many front-drive compacts. Stick-shift models get an EPA-estimated 28 mpg combined.\n\nRide quality is sound, with good chassis control over bumps and decent isolation at higher speeds. The Ford Focus and Volkswagen Jetta still boast a degree better ride quality, and if you just want the softest ride in a compact car, the Chevrolet Cruze is your chariot. But the Impreza is close behind.\n\nThe Impreza’s all-wheel drive — a more advanced system when paired with the CVT — delivers excellent grip. Get two or three wheels over a patch of ice and the Impreza claws its way through with minimal wheel spin. Throw the car into a corner and it handles that well, too. Quicker-ratio power steering for 2015 delivers sharp, immediate turn-in response, and the car’s chassis allows controllable four-wheel power slides that are seldom possible in the Impreza’s front-drive competitors, save perhaps the Focus.\n\nNote that the base Impreza 2.0i lacks a rear stabilizer bar, which theoretically diminishes handling. We haven’t driven the base model for 2015, however.\n\nInterior\nSave a redesigned multimedia system, the cabin’s conservative layout hasn’t changed for 2015, and it’s starting to look outdated. But cabin materials impress, with a level of consistency — low-gloss padding on both rows of doors, for example — that’s rare in this class. Visibility continues to be excellent, with narrow A-pillars and tall windows. The car’s profile may look stodgy, but all that glass helps you see, and I prefer it to some of the Subie’s shapelier competitors.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable overall, and the backseat has enough room for adults. Subaru remains one of a few automakers to offer heated cloth front seats, which come in Premium and Sport Premium grades. All Limited models have leather upholstery (also heated), but Subaru restricts dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver’s seat — both readily available among competitors — to the Impreza-based WRX or WRX STI.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Impreza’s overhauled multimedia system steals the show, turning what was a low point in the 2012-2014 car into what’s arguably the 2015’s best feature. Our test car’s 7-inch screen had responsive swipe functions, plus navigation (optional on the Limited and Sport Limited) that swiped and pinched at near-smartphone speeds.\n\nTouch-sensitive buttons flank the 7-inch system, and while I’m a longstanding detractor of those in any car, at least the tuning and volume knobs are real. In 2.0i and 2.0i Premium models, a 6.2-inch version of the screen teams with (huzzah!) conventional mechanical buttons. HD radio, USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and smartphone-streamed apps for Pandora, Aha and iHeart Radio are all standard. For a sub-$20,000 entry model, that’s impressive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume in the Impreza sedan is just 12 cubic feet, which is on the small side for this class. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. Impreza hatchbacks have 22.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which aligns with other small hatchbacks but isn’t directly comparable to the Impreza sedan’s trunk because of different measuring methodology (read more here). Fold the seats down and the Impreza hatchback has a hatchback-competitive 52.4 cubic feet of maximum cargo room.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Impreza earned the top score, good, in all tests. With Subaru’s highly rated EyeSight system, it gets IIHS’ highest award, Top Safety Pick Plus.\n\nOptional on Limited grades, EyeSight uses two cameras near the rearview mirror to package adaptive cruise control with lane departure warning and auto-braking forward collision warning systems. All trim levels also have a backup camera, all-disc antilock brakes, seven airbags and a required electronic stability system.\n\nSee all the safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith the destination fee and an automatic transmission, the base Impreza 2.0i sedan starts around $20,000 and comes with the backup camera, the feature-loaded multimedia system, cruise control and the usual power accessories. With the exception of the value-priced Toyota Corolla LE, that’s right in the thick of the front-drive competition.\n\nSubaru has spent decades trying to minimize the cost and efficiency penalties of all-wheel drive, and the 2015 Impreza is the fullest realization of that goal to-date. Sunbelt-state drivers may still find little reason to consider one, but compact-car shoppers elsewhere should consider Subaru’s alternative.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Impreza?\n\nThe Subaru Impreza is a compact car available as a sedan or four-door hatchback. Competing against the likes of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, the Impreza is equipped with a 152-horsepower, horizontally opposed 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission; a continuously variable automatic transmission is optional. What really sets the Impreza apart is the standard fitment of all-wheel drive on every trim: The added grip is a boon for car buyers on a budget who routinely navigate slick roads. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Impreza? \n\nThe 2023 Impreza sedan and hatchback are carryovers from the previous model year. A redesigned Impreza — in hatchback form only — debuts for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Impreza Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nKeyless entry\nFront USB port\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nRearview camera\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower moonroof\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic air conditioning\nPush-button start\n8-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nReverse automatic braking\nAdaptive LED headlights\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Impreza?\n\nThe Impreza is a solid value, and standard all-wheel drive makes it a worthy alternative not only to other compact sedans and hatches, but also to small SUVs like the Honda HR-V,  Nissan Kicks and Toyota Corolla Cross. There’s a paucity of standard active-safety features on the Impreza, unfortunately, though many are available on upper trims. Performance from the 152-hp four-cylinder isn’t exactly dazzling, but it’s easy on your fuel budget. If cargo space is a prime consideration, the Impreza hatchback’s roomier cargo area gives it the edge over the sedan.",

      "expert_review": "If Mazda boasts “zoom, zoom,” Subaru should lay claim to “hold on.”\n\nSubaru is the Japanese automaker known for initiating the craze to crossovers. It produces a lineup of sedans, wagons and sport-utility vehicles that since 1997 all feature all-wheel-drive.\n\nSo, Subaru has gained a reputation for being a vehicle that provides sure-footed motoring in foul weather–a winter necessity like boots, gloves, window scraper and snow blower.\n\nSubaru spokesman Mike Whelan bangs his chest and proclaims: “All-wheel-drive is a shield that we proudly carry.”\n\nOK, when you’re a hired company pitchman, you get carried away at times. But in riding AWD into battle through snow, sleet, rain and even sand, Subaru left itself vulnerable to those who viewed its vehicles simply as workhorses.\n\nImpreza, Subaru’s subcompact offering, has been redesigned for ’02 and expanded to include a high-performance WRX rendition.\n\nAWD may be a shield, but Subaru’s new WRX designation for the turbocharged subcompact Impreza is the weapon that goes with it.\n\nThe Impreza WRX, modeled after Subaru’s rally car, means that while your typical Subaru still goes in the snow, any WRX high-performance version scoots like a sprinter when the roads are dry and/or twisting. WRX makes the Impreza a car for any season and any reason.\n\nWRX was introduced last spring as an early ’02 addition to the lineup and is helping serve its intended purpose. It’s getting younger people and driving enthusiasts–not just empty-nesters looking for security on the long drive to visit the grandkids–into showrooms.\n\nWe tested the new-for-’02 Subaru Impreza WRX sport wagon. Thanks to designers, the wagon looks more like a sport sedan with such touches as the back window glass wrapping around the sides to cover the rear roof pillars, body-colored plastic ground effects and a tailgate spoiler that further hides the wagon underneath.\n\nAn aluminum alloy hood with an integral scoop to feed cool air to the turbo intercooler and fog lights contribute to the sportiness.\n\nAnd, of course, it comes with the Subaru shield, AWD.\n\nWhat makes the WRX special is its 2-liter, 227-horsepower, turbocharged 4-cylinder derived from Subaru’s World Rally Championship and SCCA Pro Rally Group rally cars.\n\nWith full-time AWD, Subaru is known for function. With its 227-h.p. turbo 4 and sports-tuned suspension, the WRX adds fun to the equation. Before WRX, Subaru was known for practicality; with WRX, it’s known for performance.\n\nSubaru is preaching the same lesson that Audi has gotten across to enthusiasts with its Quattro AWD system, that AWD lets you hold the road in sharp corners and tight turns and gives sedan or wagon a sporty personality as well as all-season security.\n\nOne of the chief reasons consumers have turned to sport-utes is f or go-anywhere, any time AWD. One of the reasons automakers are adding crossover vehicles is that consumers enjoy the security of AWD, but don’t like the truck-like ride, handling or mileage of truck-based SUVs.\n\nSubaru is an alliance partner of General Motors, which bought into the company to gain access to its AWD technology. We hope Subaru will be called upon to contribute to GM’s small-car strategy because GM has treated small cars as necessary evils for the budget-minded that contribute little to the company coffers.\n\nHowever, the first joint-venture vehicle from the alliance will be a seven-passenger AWD crossover due out in the 2005 calendar year. GM and Subaru will get a version, with the GM division chosen to market the machine to be made public.\n\nWhat about small cars? Well, Bob Lutz, GM vice chairman and future-product guru, salivates when Subaru WRX is mentioned in conversation. Stay tuned.\n\nWRX gives Impreza a different set of driving dynamics without taking away from its first-and-foremost function as an AWD wagon. Still practical, but with the added benefits of more precise handling and predictable stability.\n\nThe Subaru philosophy has influenced others. GM and Toyota, for example, teamed up to bring out the Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe for ’03 in sporty (Matrix XRS and Vibe GT) and AWD versions.\n\n“They’ve joined the bandwagon,” Whelan said.\n\nWith the arrival of the WRX early last year, Subaru sales rose to 186,000 units for the year from 176,000 in ’00. The forecast is about 195,000 for ’02.\n\nThe long-term target is 250,000 sales in 2005, a goal that will require more product, beginning with a redesigned ’03 Forester sport-ute (which shares the a platform with the Legacy) this month followed this fall by a new Baja, an AWD, four-door, car-based pickup/sport-utility hybrid. The Baja, derived from the Legacy/Outback platform, will be built at its plant with Isuzu in Lafayette, Ind., where Legacy/Outback are produced.\n\nCapacity will be increased to ensure a supply of up to 25,000 Bajas annually.\n\nBaja is a modernized version of the Subaru Brat, the subcompact truck with a pair of plastic seats in the cargo bed that allowed Subaru to claim it was a passenger vehicle and escape the 25 percent duty on imported trucks.\n\nBaja’s design concept is similar to the Chevrolet Avalanche, a full-size truck with four doors and a small cargo bed. The rear seat and bulkhead fold to expand the cargo area and transform Baja from a four-passenger vehicle to a two-seater. Subaru calls it the Switchback system. GM calls it a midgate.\n\nOther changes include a facelift for the Legacy/Outback in July for ’03 and an all-new Legacy/Outback for ’05.\n\nBase price of the WRX tested is $23,495. Except for automatic ($1,000), it comes fully equipped (power sunroof not offered). Air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with cassette and in-dash CD changer; power windows/locks/mirrors; 60/40 split back rear seats; cruise control; keyless entry; tilt steering; front/side air bags; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; daytime running lights; 16-inch, all-season tires; and floor mats are standard.\n\nNoteworthy items include wide, cozy seats with good side support for long-distance and/or aggressive motoring; lots of little storage areas including under the rear cargo floor; user friendly sight/reach lines for controls; decorative aluminum alloy pedal covers, and considering full-time AWD, the mileage rating–20 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway–is tolerable.\n\nA few drawbacks: Mirrors are a tad too small, and the rear cabin a little tight.",

      "expert_review": "Once again, Subaru has set out to blaze its own trail.\n\nHot on the muddy tracks of the all-wheel-drive Legacy Outback comes the smaller, youth-oriented Impreza Outback Sport, applying the same rugged, outdoors formula that has made the Legacy such a smashing success.\n\nSubaru owns this neck of the woods. A venerable builder of all-wheel-drive automobiles, with a reputation as a quirky denizen of the Northeast Snow Belt, Subaru is the only automaker to combine the driveability of compact cars with the go-anywhere attitude of the ubiquitous sport-utility vehicles.\n\nLike the Legacy Outback, the Outback Sport is basically a jacked-up all-wheel-drive Impreza wagon with some muscular body cladding, and oversized wheels and tires. It has the adventurous look of a sport-utility truck without the size, initial cost or gas-hog expense.\n\nFor its youthful mission, the Sport puts more of the emphasis on fun and cheeky personality. This was Subaru’s tack when it marketed the funky BRAT in the ’70s, conceivably the first of the compact sport-utility vehicles.\n\nTrue to its name, the Outback Sport adds a sporting dimension to the equation. Unlike the lumbering, high-profile sport-utes, the Impreza drives and corners like a sports sedan, with minimal body sway despite the raised suspension. Zipping along a winding dirt road, the little Sport makes you feel like a rally champ.\n\nAs well it should. The Outback Sport benefits from Subaru’s years of World Rally Championship success. Subaru’s competition Impreza, a fire-breathing 300-horsepower version, won both the 1995 driver’s and manufacturer’s title using the same production chassis, suspension and drivetrain layout as the showroom Impreza.\n\nOne carry-over from the competition Impreza is the huge, aggressive-looking scoop on the Outback Sport’s hood that I found, frankly, heavy-handed and embarrassing. The scoop is obviously designed to appeal to the younger drivers, along with the white-letter tires and “sport” graphic.\n\nThere was snow in the Bradshaw Mountains over Thanksgiving weekend, and the Outback Sport was in its element, sloshing along the rugged roads beyond Crown King. The Impreza climbed like a cat, sure-footed and capable, limited only by its low clearance, compared with Jeeps and the like.\n\nSome of those flannel-shirted guys in jacked-up pickup trucks did look kind of surprised to see a subcompact car up there traversing the hilly, slippery terrain.\n\nObviously, the Outback Sport is still a car and not a Jeep, so you can’t expect it to clamber over big boulders or tackle deeply rutted trails. Besides the ground-clearance limitation, the complex all-wheel-drive system is just not designed for the rough stuff, both in terms of performance and durability.\n\nWhat it can do is turn those dirt roads and snowy trails into playthings. The Impreza made quick work of the steep hairpin switchbacks on the desert road to Crown King, an old rail bed for mining trains, charging around t hem under throttle, just like the rally guys.\n\nThe 2.2-liter engine coupled with a five-speed gearbox provides plenty of pull for the lightweight car. A bit rough-sounding under acceleration, the horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine, similar in layout to a rear-engine Volkswagen, is remarkably smooth and quiet at highway speeds.\n\nGas mileage is excellent, a definite plus over the sport-utility vehicles.\n\nWhile the Outback Sport stands alone as dirt-road sports sedan, it does have some significant challengers. The Toyota RAV4 has hit the ground running, and Honda’s upcoming CR-V could cut into the market.\n\nAnd Subaru is joining the sport-utility club in January, when it unveils its high-profile vehicle at the Detroit Auto Show. Sharing many components with the Legacy, it should put Subaru head-to-head with the RAV4 and the CR-V.\n\nMeanwhile, the Outback siblings willcontinue offering the unique flexibility of well-sorted passenger cars that don’t mind gettin g down an d dirty.\n\n1996 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door wagon, all-wheel-drive. Base price: $17,955. Price as tested: $20,107. Engine: 2.2-liter opposed four, 137 horsepower at 5,400 rpm, 145 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed stick shift. Curb weight: 2,835 pounds. Length: 172.2 inches. Wheelbase: 99.2 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 23 mpg city, 30 mpg highway. Highs: Sporty handling, off-highway capabilities. Good highway manners. Low price, good gas mileage. Lows: Fake hood scoop. Limited ground clearance.",

      "expert_review": "A tip to the design gurus at Subaru: Your brand-spanking new Impreza WRX desperately needs one of those construction-zone orange signs plastered to its front end. Consider it a little extra liability insurance.\n\n“WARNING: Sedan in rearview mirror is nowhere near what it appears.”\n\nDropped jaws, strange glances and wide smiles don’t cover the range of emotions the unassuming little Impreza produced during 200 miles of wind-in-your-hair fun.\n\nOne mile in the redesigned 2002 Impreza is enough to confirm this: The WRX is a fraud. It rolls into town shaped like a loaf of bread. It slices the competition at the turn of a key.\n\nIt comes with a turbo and 227 ponies under the hood. It comes with a hood scoop! Did somebody say Subaru?\n\nIt’s been a long time since the Japanese car company with a flair for four-wheel drive produced a sports-sedan heart pounder that rides like a heat-seeking missile. In the WRX (the “WR” stands for “World Rally” after Subaru’s European road races) it combines both.\n\nWorried about rain or snow? The Impreza’s all-wheel-drive is all over it. Concerned about beating a BMW off the stoplight? Got it. Want one even better? It might be the most affordable rocket on the road.\n\nWith that much pull out of a 2.0liter, flat four-cylinder engine, with such little curb weight – at 3,000 pounds it has more horsepower per pound than an Audi S4 or BMW 330xi – and with a crisp shifter, pinpoint handling and roller coaster acceleration, you expect BMW prices. What you pay is $24,000.\n\nSneaky Impreza. What you see isn’t nearly what you get.\n\nAnd let’s talk about what you see.\n\nIf the Impreza were a beauty contestant, she wouldn’t make it to the swimsuit competition.\n\nIt’s not that the WRX is ugly. Just boxy. When Subaru decided it wanted to bring its high-power sports sedan from overseas to America, it forgot that style is sometimes as important as substance – especially for Madison Avenue or buyers in Madison, Wis.\n\nSquare and snub-nosed, the WRX won’t earn whistles from the corner – it looks more like a suppedup, squared-off Dodge Neon – but it will earn you bragging rights over your Porsche and Audi friends.\n\nMash the pedal and watch them in the rearview mirror. Thanks to a five-speed manual and that turbo that loves to rev, the Impreza does 0-to-60 mph in under six seconds and the quarter mile in under 15. In layman’s terms: Faster than a Porsche Boxster. And a BMW Z3. And an Audi A4 2.8 Quattro. And on . . . and on . . . and on.\n\nThere is some turbo lag from first to second gear – a slight pause in pure acceleration before the turbo starts spinning and whining – but it’s worth the wait. Hit 2,4000 rpm and the torque really grabs you. Hit 4k and it swells up and hurtles you back into the Impreza’s racing-inspired bucket seats.\n\nCar enthusiasts, line up to the left.\n\nBut an important note: You’ve got to be one to truly love this machine.\n\nThis is no Caddy in disguise. With its cloth seats, racy drilled-aluminum pedals and functional layout, everything is first-rate – but not 5star. Faux wood, leather lumbar and a luxury-liner ride are not included with the price.\n\nInterior materials are above the subcompact norm, but don’t expect a sunroof, rear-deck spoiler or highfi stereo. Based on an affordable frame, body construction is not for the faint of heart. Doors are light and rattle when slammed shut. The trunk lid seems thin.\n\nFor Subaru, it’s all about body weight.\n\nWith all that power, and not a lot of tow, the Impreza is meant to be driven. Period. With a short wheelbase, handling is razor-tight, steering is nicely weighted and the suspension is stiff. The shifter is also seamless with short, sure throws reminiscent of a Honda S2000. And the all-wheel-drive gives you piece of mind when you hit some rough spots in the road.\n\nSixteen-inch Bridgestone Potenza tires carry four-wheel disc brakes with twin-piston front calipers giving you th tential for some rally-esque driving, balance and stick without too much rubber. Stability and traction control give you security.\n\nBack seat room, you’ll have to fight over.\n\nWhere the Impreza scores in the fun quotient it lags in family hauling. Rear-seat room is at a premium in the WRX – more cramped than comfy. And although there is plenty of head and leg room up front, rear door openings are tight and space is limited.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows and locks, anti-lock brakes, front and side airbags, an indash, six-disc CD player and a rearseat pass-through for long cargo, like skis.\n\nAnd for $24,520 topped out, this is a performer that should provide plenty of extra cash for those wintery vacations north – a unique sport sedan value in a valley of lookalikes.\n\nAffordable, safe, understated yet fun.\n\nConsider yourself warned.\n\n2002 Subaru Impreza WRX\n\nVehicle type: All-wheel-drive, front engine, four-door, five-passenger sports sedan.\n\nStandard equipment: Air conditioning; four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes; limited-slip differential; front and side air bags; fog lights; 16-inch alloy wheels; AM/FM/cassette/six-CD audio; cruise control; power locks, mirrors and windows; remote keyless entry; daytime running lights.\n\nCompetition: Acura Integra Type R, Volkswagen GTI, Toyota Celica GT-S\n\nEngine: 227 horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\n\nTorque: 217 foot-lbs. @ 4,000 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 99.4 inches\n\nLength: 173.4 inches\n\nMPG rating: 20 mpg city/27 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles; the drivetrain is five years/60,000 miles; body corrosion is five years/unlimited miles and roadside assistance is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $23,995\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $24,520",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: EyeSight safety package is standard on all models with continuously variable automatic transmission. Grille and front bumper get fresh look. Automatic door locks and a rear seat reminder are standard on all models.\n\nPrice change: It varies by model. Base models with manual transmission are $115 higher; with the CVT they are $415 higher. Premium prices rise by $515 and Limited by $815. The base price is up $1,315 on the Sport sedan, $215 on the Sport hatchback with manual transmission and $515 on Sport hatchback with the CVT (all prices include a destination charge, which rises $15 to $900).\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2020. EyeSight is now standard on all automatic transmission models at modestly higher prices.\n\nThe EyeSight safety package is standard for 2020 on all Impreza models with the continuously variable automatic transmission. All versions of Subaru’s compact sedan and hatchback also come with a new rear seat reminder that alerts the driver to check the backseat before leaving the vehicle.\n\nRelated: National Stick Shift Day: 6 Cars We Wish Had Manuals (and 3 We’re OK Without)\n\nEyeSight was an $845 option on the base model last year and part of more expensive packages for the Premium and Sport. Starting prices on base models with the CVT rise by $415, to $20,895 for the sedan and $21,395 for the hatchback (all prices include the $900 destination charge). EyeSight includes automatic front emergency braking, lane departure and sway warnings, and lane keep assist; it is not offered on models with the five-speed manual transmission.\n\nAll models have a fresh face for 2020 from a new grille and front bumper, and standard automatic door locks.\n\nOn the Sport sedan, the CVT is now standard and the five-speed manual is listed as a no-cost option; the base price jumps $1,315 to $24,395. The manual remains standard on the Sport hatchback; the CVT is optional (and includes EyeSight) for $1,100 more.\n\nThe Sport sedan and Limited models also gain as standard the Si-Drive powertrain management system with Sport and Intelligent modes. Blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert are newly standard on the Limited.\n\nAll models come with a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine with 152 horsepower and standard all-wheel drive. The five-speed manual is standard on the base sedan and hatchback and the Sport hatchback. All others come with the CVT, which on Premium, Sport and Limited models adds a seven-speed manual mode with paddle shifters.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMore Subaru Impreza News\nResearch the 2020 Subaru Impreza\nFind a 2020 Subaru Impreza Near You\nFind Your Perfect Match\n\nStandard AWD and, for 2020, the Eyesight safety package on all automatic transmission models, makes the Impreza a worthy choice among compacts in the snow belt. It isn’t among the most refined in its class, but it has decent ride and handling, sufficient passenger space for four people and reasonable starting prices in the base and Premium trim levels.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Upgraded with a rich new multimedia system and higher gas mileage, the 2015 Subaru Impreza is a serious contender for all small-car shoppers, even if you don’t think you need all-wheel drive.\n\nChanges for 2015 include some visual tweaks and an overhauled, smartphone-quality dashboard display, which even the base Impreza gets in scaled-down form. As before, the car comes as a four-door sedan or five-door hatchback in 2.0i base, Premium and Limited trim levels; the hatchback also gets Sport Premium and Sport Limited grades. Compare the trims here or stack up the 2014 and 2015 Impreza here. If you’re looking for the related XV Crosstrek, WRX or WRX STI, we cover them on separate pages in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nExterior & Styling\nReshaped bumper openings with bisecting chrome spears grace all trim levels, including our Subaru Impreza 2.0 Limited sedan. It’s a dressier appearance I appreciate most on the base and Premium versions; last year’s car just had formless black pits that shouted: “Fog lights should go here!”\n\nFrom the side or rear, the 2015 Impreza is essentially unchanged. Hatchback versions are 6.5 inches shorter in length than the sedan, though both cars share the same tidy 34.8-inch turning circle. Fifteen-inch steel wheels are standard, and 16- or 17-inch alloys are optional.\n\nHow It Drives\nDespite Subaru’s claims of more insulation for 2015, the Impreza remains noisy. Wind noise is significant at highway speeds, even for this class. Dig into the gas pedal and the Subaru Impreza’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder emits a wheezy, mechanical whine as the tach needle swings upward. Our test car also exhibited a peculiar whine at low speeds that didn’t correlate to engine load and disappeared above 10 mph or so. It may have come from the Yokohama Avid S34 P205/50R17 tires, so keep an ear out on your test drive.\n\nThe drivetrain itself has adequate power, with sufficient torque and peppy response at lower speeds after an initial moment of accelerator lag. Passing at any speed requires most of the flat-4 engine’s reserves, but power was adequate even with four adults aboard. The continuously variable automatic transmission is unobtrusive enough to be mistaken for a conventional automatic. Push it hard and it behaves as such, holding a ratio, revving higher and then dropping to the next “gear.” It’s all contrived, of course, as CVTs lack fixed gears, but it mitigates the single biggest annoyance of these transmissions: the rubber-band sensation of disconnect between how much gas you give and how much you hear the engine rev.\n\nGiven the standard all-wheel drive, gas mileage for this front-engine flat-four Subaru is rated an outstanding 31 mpg combined with the CVT. That’s up 1 mpg this year, and it’s competitive with many front-wheel- drive compacts. Five-speed stick-shift models get an EPA-estimated 28 mpg combined.\n\nRide quality is sound, with good chassis control over bumps and decent isolation at higher speeds. The Ford Focus and Volkswagen Jetta still boast a degree better ride quality, and if you just want the softest ride in a compact car, the Chevrolet Cruze is your chariot. But the Impreza is close behind.\n\nThe Subaru Impreza’s all-wheel drive (AWD) — a more advanced system when paired with the CVT — delivers excellent grip. Get two or three wheels over a patch of ice and the Impreza claws its way through with minimal wheel spin. Throw the car into a corner and it handles that well, too. Quicker-ratio power steering for 2015 delivers sharp, immediate turn-in response, and the car’s chassis allows controllable four-wheel power slides that are seldom possible in the Impreza’s front-drive competitors, save perhaps the Focus.\n\nNote that the base Subaru Impreza 2.0i lacks a rear stabilizer bar, which theoretically diminishes handling. We haven’t driven the base model for 2015, however.\n\nInterior\nSave a redesigned multimedia system, the cabin’s conservative layout hasn’t changed for 2015, and it’s starting to look outdated. But cabin materials impress, with a level of consistency — low-gloss padding on both rows of doors, for example — that’s rare in this class. Visibility continues to be excellent, with narrow A-pillars and tall windows. The car’s profile may look stodgy, but all that glass helps you see, and I prefer it to some of the Subie’s shapelier competitors.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable overall, and the backseat has enough room for adults. Subaru remains one of a few automakers to offer heated cloth front seats, which come in Premium and Sport Premium grades. All Limited models have leather upholstery (also heated), but Subaru restricts dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver’s seat — both readily available among competitors — to the Impreza-based WRX or WRX STI.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Subaru Impreza’s overhauled multimedia system steals the show, turning what was a low point in the 2012-2014 car into what’s arguably the 2015’s best feature. Our test car’s 7-inch screen had responsive swipe functions, plus navigation (optional on the Limited and Sport Limited) that swiped and pinched at near-smartphone speeds.\n\nTouch-sensitive buttons flank the 7-inch system, and while I’m a longstanding detractor of those in any car, at least the tuning and volume knobs are real. In 2.0i and 2.0i Premium models, a 6.2-inch version of the screen teams with (huzzah!) conventional mechanical buttons. HD radio, USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and smartphone-streamed apps for Pandora, Aha and iHeart Radio are all standard. Keyless entry is also standard. For a sub-$20,000 entry model, that’s impressive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume in the Subaru Impreza sedan is just 12 cubic feet, which is on the small side for this class. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. Impreza hatchbacks have 22.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, which aligns with other small hatchbacks but isn’t directly comparable to the Impreza sedan’s trunk because of different measuring methodology (read more here). Fold the seats down and the Impreza hatchback has a hatchback-competitive 52.4 cubic feet of maximum cargo room.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Subaru Impreza earned the top score, good, in all tests. With Subaru’s highly rated EyeSight system, it gets IIHS’ highest award, Top Safety Pick Plus.\n\nOptional on Limited grades, EyeSight uses two cameras near the rearview mirror to package adaptive cruise control with lane departure warning and auto-braking forward pre-collision warning systems. All trim levels also have a backup camera, all-disc antilock brakes, seven airbags and a required electronic stability system.\n\nSee all the safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith the destination fee and an automatic transmission, the base price for the Subaru Impreza 2.0i sedan starts around $20,000 and comes with the backup camera, the feature-loaded multimedia system, cruise control and the usual power accessories. With the exception of the value-priced Toyota Corolla LE, that’s right in the thick of the front-drive competition.\n\nSubaru has spent decades trying to minimize the cost and efficiency penalties of AWD, and the 2015 Impreza is the fullest realization of that goal to-date. Sunbelt-state drivers may still find little reason to consider one, but compact-car body-type shoppers elsewhere (Namely areas that use their wiper blades more than a handful of times a year) should consider Subaru’s alternative.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The Good About the Ugly\n\nSubaru makes cars that are good and ugly.\n\nThat is high praise, as evidenced by the 2003 Impreza 2.5 RS sedan. It is the ugliest of the ugly in Subaru’s lineup. But I love its billowed front fenders, bug-eyed headlamps and discount-store interior. Mostly, I love its soul.\n\nThe little car has chutzpah. It runs like a sports car twice its price on dry highways. It zips in and out and around curves with exceptional grace. It is fearless in up to six inches of snow, but it backs away from, or gets stuck in, substantially higher drifts.\n\nThat’s to be expected. The 2.5 RS clears the ground by 5.9 inches. Do the math. Six inches is shorter than 18, 36 or 53 inches — the variously reported amounts of snow that fell on the East Coast last week.\n\nI didn’t do the math in some neighborhoods. I got stuck, but I managed to work my way out by shifting the all-wheel-drive 2.5 RS into reverse, backing up a bit, and then dropping it into second gear and slowly moving forward.\n\nSuccess in those episodes made me feel good. But, truth is, I had little to do with the car’s extraction from the snow mounds. Credit goes to the car. It’s that good, and it’s surrounded by a family of equally good, oddly styled models.\n\nIn all, there are five cars in the Impreza line — the 2.5 TS Sport Wagon and Outback Sport, the 2.5 RS sedan, and the unbelievably fast WRX sedan and WRX Sport Wagon. All five models come standard with a Subaru all-wheel-drive system, of which there are three versions available.\n\nIn the 165-horsepower 2.5 RS, equipped with a standard five-speed manual transmission, Subaru uses what it calls “continuous all-wheel drive.” That system normally provides a 50-50 sharing of drive power between the front and rear wheels. But when the front wheels slip, more power shifts to the rear. When the rear wheels slip, more power shifts to the front. The power transfer is done automatically. The only thing the driver has to do is use common sense. Again: A vehicle with a 5.9-inch ground clearance won’t get you through two feet of snow.\n\nSubaru extensively redesigned all of its Impreza cars last year, leaving it with little to do for the 2003 models. So, the company is planning to use marketing muscle to sell those. It has standardized some equipment, such as a keyless vehicle entry system, now sold on the 2.5 RS.\n\nSubaru’s 600 U.S. dealers and their aftermarket partners are offering an array of accessories and components designed to dress up the 2.5 RS and its hot-tempered cousin, the WRX, for weekend track races sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America. Those additional or substituted suspension, braking and engine pieces won’t make the 2.5 RS sedan look any better. Nor, for that matter, will the cosmetic add-ons do much to enhance the car’s physical appearance.\n\nBut the people who know and love the 2.5 RS could care less about style. They are performance iconoclasts interested only in making an impression at the finish line — or on the street at the expense of, say, a BMW 3-Series driver.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: Other than styling, or the lack thereof, there’s not much bad to say about the 2.5 RS. Subaru could scrap that annoying toy-horn alarm that honks every time you press the remote-control button to lock the car. That’s about it.\n\nPraise: This little car is so much fun to drive, you wind up not caring how goofy it looks. You just want to get in it and go! It’s the most pocket-rocket fun you’ll have outside of driving the 227-horsepower WRX.\n\nHead-turning quotient: In the eye of the beholder. I saw ugly. Economy weekend track warriors looked at it and saw . . . zooommm!\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: After a week in the 2.5 RS, I’m tempted to say I’d drive it across country — but not quite. It gets high ma s in acceleration and handling. But the ride remains classic small-car, rather bumpy in the saddle after a long day.\n\nLayout/body style: Front-engine, all-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nEngine/transmissions: The Impreza RS comes with a 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed (boxer), 16-valve four-cylinder engine that develops 165 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 166 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. It can be linked to a five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nCapacities: The 2.5 RS seats five people. Cargo capacity is 11 cubic feet. Fuel capacity is 15.9 gallons. Regular unleaded gasoline, minimum 87 octane, required.\n\nMileage: I averaged 25 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving.\n\nSafety: Safer than it looks. Rigid roll-cage construction. A four-wheel anti-lock brake system is standard. Dual-front air bags. Three-point seat belts. Wear the belts. Lower anchors and tethers for children. Use them properly. Check dealer for details.\n\nPrice: Base price is $19,195. Dealer invoice price on base model is $17,640. Price as tested is $20,220 including $500 in options (rear deck spoiler and rear differential protector) and a $525 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A quality cheap thrill. Edges the competition (Ford Focus ZTS, Honda Civic Si, Mitsubishi Galant ES, Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T) with all-wheel drive.",

      "expert_review": "There are some exciting new five-door compacts on the road, from the Kia Spectra5 to the Audi A3 Sportback, and more to come, including the sexy Dodge Caliber. Their presence makes the Subaru Impreza Outback Sport wagon seem even more dated — almost as if time were standing still when you’re sitting in the driver’s seat.\n\nWe tested a 2005 Outback Sport Special Edition, with a sticker price of $20,870.\n\nHE: Believe it or not, it wasn’t that long ago when the Impreza wagon stood out from the rest of the Japanese compact crowd. It still offers the benefit of standard all-wheel drive, but its other attributes and idiosyncrasies — the flat-four engine, the outdoorsy Outback trim level, even the five-door profile that once defied easy categorization — don’t seem quite so unique or compelling these days. More than anything, the Impreza seems like a car in need of a drastic overhaul, but the next-generation version is still more than a year away, according to the Tokyo grapevine.\n\nSHE: You used the word “compelling.” I can’t think of a single thing that would make me recommend the Impreza over any other compact in the class. It looks and feels strictly middle-of-the-road. I certainly like the extra security and stability of all-wheel drive. But why should I give up an equally critical feature like side air bags? I remember when Subarus came with other neat items that set them apart — things like weather-band radio. No such luck on the Impreza.\n\nHE: The fact that Subaru has let the Impreza languish for so long without a major makeover tells me that money is just as tight these days at the parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, as it is at Subaru’s U.S. affiliate, General Motors Corp. But the company also did such a good job in redesigning the midsize Legacy sedan and wagon last year that the age of the Impreza stands out even more.\n\nSHE: We probably shouldn’t be so critical, considering that Subaru is offering lots of extra equipment on the Special Edition model for not much more money. You get a rear spoiler, an armrest extension, a 260-watt audio system with a subwoofer and a six-disc CD changer, plus an auto-dimming mirror and compass — $1,500 worth of options for only $500. Still, the Impreza Outback Sport lacks some basic features that many of its competitors have, such as lighted vanity mirrors. The rear seat in particular is appalling — no reading lights, no vents, no in-door storage. Not a very pleasant place to get stuck on a long drive.\n\nHE: Especially not if you’re much older than 5 or 6. There is simply no leg room in the rear. I’m more turned off by a four-cylinder engine that feels overworked and underpowered with just two adults on board and by the fact that Subaru offers only an old-style four-speed automatic transmission as an option, not a more modern five- or six-speed as many of its competitors now provide. You also pay a fuel-economy penalty with the automatic and the all-wheel drive. The EPA says you can expect to realize about 22 miles per gallon in city driving and only 28 on the highway — pretty dismal numbers for a compact wagon.\n\nSHE: When Subaru finally does get around to redesigning the Impreza, probably for model year 2007, I hope they drop the silly Outback trim level, which was originally intended to buy the company a little time until they could get some utility vehicles into the market. OK, they now sell the Forester and the new Tribeca, so the whole point behind using the Outback packaging concept seems to have come and gone.\n\nHE: Subaru has always been just a little quirkier than its Japanese counterparts, but you’d never guess it from looking at or driving the Impreza. They have a chance to raise the bar again when it comes time to redesign this car. Until then, you’re better served by shopping the competitors, including such domestic brands as Chevrolet, Ford and Pontiac, all of which offer better values in this segment and price class.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services firm.",

      "expert_review": "This could be the perfect “kid car,” a category I like to recapitulate as graduation time beckons, so take notes, indulgent parents. The Subaru Impreza wagon is foremost an all-wheel-drive machine, as are all Subarus. It has plenty of room for flexible young bodies and their appurtenances, it’s affordable, it handles and stops decently, it’s not exactly overpowered, and it’s so pitifully hog-ugly, they’ll only drive it when they have to, like when their buddy with the V-8 convertible isn’t available.\n\nLooks are a subjective thing, of course, and the accompanying photo doesn’t really do the car’s dorkiness justice. In the round, it goes beyond funky and well into the realm of pathos. It starts out okay – the cowcatcher front bumper perhaps a leetle overdone – but that foreshortened rear end looks as if it were copped from a Pacer recycling dump (which can’t be the case, because it’s not rusted). It certainly is a standout in the Subaru line, and maybe that’s what they intended. The rest of their vehicles vary from clean to downright amusing, thinking here of the Impreza RS “boy racer” variants.\n\nThe Impreza Sport Wagon, to give it its proper tongue-in-cheek name, comes in only the L state of trim, and that’s not shabby. You get the all-wheel drive, a five-speed manual transmission, power steering and brakes, front air bags, air conditioning, an AM-FM-cassette stereo, tinted glass, power windows and door locks, power outside mirrors, tilt wheel, rear window defroster, washer and wiper, remote trunk release, power tap, 60/40 fold-down rear seats and lots of trim bits.\n\nThis abundance comes at a price of $16,790, delivered, and includes a total of 110 cubic feet of interior volume. The first add-on many people would want is an automatic transmission, and Subaru’s four-speed overdrive adds an extra $800. There are numerous other options, small stuff, that one can add, plus a serious ($695) premium sound system. On the whole, though, it takes a bit of work to break through the $19K barrier.\n\nThe go power comes from the smaller of Subaru’s flat-four engines, a 16-valve, single-overhead-cam job with output of 142 hp (@5,600 rpm) and 149 foot-pounds of torque (@3,600). Like its bigger brother, the 2.5-liter, this engine has the virtue of being compact and helps lower the vehicle’s center of gravity, for a well-planted feel. Such torque as there is is present over a wide range of engine speeds, making it a good partner for an automatic. The engine’s only vice is a rather unpleasant, raspy sound at open throttle settings, but most of that commotion is kept outside the cabin.\n\nIt asks for only regular unleaded and not that much of it – EPA ratings are 23 mpg city, 29 highway for both transmissions. I doled out the hydrocarbons to the tune of a gallon every 26.6 miles, and that in mostly frequent-shifting country work, not freeway loafing. Another plus, if you’re footing the gas bills. While the power is har dly awesome, neither is the weight. Even with the complexity of a secondary drivetrain and an automatic transmission, the Impreza Sport Wagon only goes 2,880 pounds. It plods from 0-60 in a tad over 10 seconds – no tire burning here – but feels lively in the middle speed ranges if you keep the revs up. The automatic transmission shifted quickly and smoothly, although it had some tendency on forced downshifts to jump from fourth to second, causing a bit of commotion in the engine compartment. That’s likely because top gear is a long-legged overdrive ratio, which you’ll appreciate at freeway speeds because it reduces the clamor to some extent.\n\nDepending on whether you’re a self-shifter or an automatic type, you get a different form of Subaru’s slick all-wheel drive. Manual cars have the older “continuous” system, which has a viscous-coupling center differential. Normally it splits power 50-50 between front and rear axles. When the axles get out of sync, the slower axle gets ower until equilibrium is restored. It’s a well-proven, bulletproof system, similar to Audi’s earlier quattro schemes. When the automatic transmission is chosen, it is mated to what Subaru calls its “active” all-wheel-drive mechanism. In this case, the norm is for 90 percent of the torque available to be shuttled forward. Motion sensors throughout the vehicle can detect weight transfer, which in effect anticipates changes in traction. The torque is redirected accordingly to the axle better able to handle it.\n\nAll this occurs of course without any driver interaction. In practice, all you feel is a car performing better, irrespective of road conditions, than you might have expected. This is an all-weather system, not an off-roading one, but halfway decent fire roads shouldn’t be out of the question, although it would be wise to invest in skid plates and remember that ground clearance is a car-like 5.7 inches.\n\nRide quality over good-to-excellent roads was good; over poor-to-fair surfaces, rather unpleasant. The four-wheel-independent suspension ran out of travel fairly early and passed a considerable amount of harshness to the interior. Worst of all, the Impreza sport Wagon seemed very loosely constructed, unlike most other Subarus. It was a gathering place for assorted bumps, thumps and rattles, despite showing very few miles on the odometer. Perhaps it was a bad day at the plant; such poor assembly is atypical.\n\nThe test car had the pricey ($695) radio upgrade package, which was quite pleasing. It had above-average tuner sensitivity, gobs of power and a rich, space-filling tonality overall. The package gets you a CD player, better speakers all around, and adds both tweeters and a self-amplified subwoofer to the mix. You can add these items individually, too, but they’ll wind up costing more. Do sample the standard unit to see whether it meets your needs.\n\n&\n\nThe Impreza has disc brakes front, drums rear. Pedal feel was rather numb, but stopping distances were reasonable. Alas, antilock is not available even as an option; Subaru’s a little behind the times on that one.\n\nThe Impreza is rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds – not task I’d want to take on with this engine. Better to stow the gear inside – there’s 25.5 cubic feet available with the rear seats up, 62 c.f. with them down. Might as well fold them down – second class is pretty tight for anybody who has to pay adult admission, but, then again, college-age folks might see that as a plus. Consumers Union rates the Impreza as well above average in reliability. It also fared better than the average in its class in crash testing.\n\nIf you can live with the dorky aspect of the vehicle, it provides a great deal of utility at a bargain price. The test machine had a bunch of extra goodies and bottom-lined at $19,200.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Some have called the new Impreza a make or break car for Subaru. The struggling Japanese automaker has never really had a strong presence in the United States.\n\nAfter 25 years of doing business in this country, Subaru has succeeded in selling vehicles only in a few markets, especially the Northeast, where heavy snowfall has made its lineup of all-wheel drive vehicles popular, and in import-oriented California. (The U.S. company that imports Subarus was founded in 1968 by former Orlando resident and Boone High School graduate Malcolm Bricklin.)\n\nThe Impreza could change that.\n\nIt is a fundamentally good car that offers decent performance, excellent fuel economy and, for Subaru, something out of the ordinary: fairly normal styling.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOurtest car came with a four-speed automatic transmission. That may have been why the Impreza was less than impressive in its ability to accelerate quickly at speeds of 40 mph and higher. A manual transmission might have made the car more responsive in passing slower traffic.\n\nThe Impreza has a 1.8-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that develops 110 horsepower. This is not your ordinary four cylinder, though.\n\nIt is a horizontally opposed engine, meaning that two cylinders are on the left and two are on the right. It is basically the same engine design used in the old Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nThe opposed-four engine, also used in Porsches, has proved to be durable, dependable and long-lasting. The test car’s engine ran smoothly and was very responsive when accelerating from a stop. However, there’s not much oomph left in midrange speeds. No complaints about the transmission. Its shifts were smooth and timed well. Fuel mileage was generally excellent. Using the air conditioner, I got 25 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nHere’s where the car really shines. I took the Impreza over some of the nastiest dirt roads I could find in Orlando andwas pleasantly surprised as the car glided over them quietly and without loss of control. The four-wheel independent suspension system is firm, yet it allows the wheels plenty of up-and-down travel over big bumps. On the road the Impreza offers a sporty ride. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is responsive. You can turn a circle in a tight 32.8 feet. Our test car came with power-assisted disc/drum brakes that did a nice job of slowing the car quickly. Anti-lock brakes are available on the top-of-the-line LS model.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Impreza sets a standard for Subaru in the way it is assembled. It’s just as good as the Honda Civic, Nissan Altima and Toyota Corolla, three of Japan’s best-selling small cars.\n\nBut the Impreza’s design is far from perfect. The door openings are small, making the car somewhat difficult for tall people to get into and out of. If you are 6 feet tall, there’s probably little chance you could get comfortable in the Im preza.\n\nThe dash layout, featuring a sensibly styled set of analog gauges in a one-piece dash, is nicely done. Switches for the lights and wipers are on the steering column and are easy to use.\n\nSubaru has designed a terrific air conditioner, one of the best I’ve tested lately in a small car. One minor gripe, though. Even though the air conditioner can cool the car to arctic extremes, the engine doesn’t run smoothly when the air conditioner’s compressor cycles on and off. The trunk offers an abundant amount of room for a small car. It’ll hold at least two golf bags and at least a half-dozen grocery bags.\n\nThe test car came with a AM/FM stereo cassette that also seemed a cut above what you usually get in an economy car.\n\nAll in all, the Impreza is a fine little car. However, it can get expensive when options are added. For instance, a sport wagon model with all-wheel drive comes with a base price of $17,599.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1993 Subaru Impreza Base price: $12,999 EPA rating: 24 mpg city/30 highway Price as tested: $14,404 Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The Subaru Impreza doesn’t have world-class performance, but it is a well-built car that’s enjoyable to drive.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: EyeSight safety package is standard on all models with continuously variable automatic transmission. Grille and front bumper get fresh look. Automatic door locks and a rear seat reminder are standard on all models.\n\nPrice change: It varies by model. Base models with manual transmission are $115 higher; with the CVT they are $415 higher. Premium prices rise by $515 and Limited by $815. The base price is up $1,315 on the Sport sedan, $215 on the Sport hatchback with manual transmission and $515 on Sport hatchback with the CVT (all prices include a destination charge, which rises $15 to $900).\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2020. EyeSight is now standard on all automatic transmission models at modestly higher prices.\n\nThe EyeSight safety package is standard for 2020 on all Impreza models with the continuously variable automatic transmission. All versions of Subaru’s compact sedan and hatchback also come with a new rear seat reminder that alerts the driver to check the backseat before leaving the vehicle.\n\nRelated: National Stick Shift Day: 6 Cars We Wish Had Manuals (and 3 We’re OK Without)\n\nEyeSight was an $845 option on the base model last year and part of more expensive packages for the Premium and Sport. Starting prices on base models with the CVT rise by $415, to $20,895 for the sedan and $21,395 for the hatchback (all prices include the $900 destination charge). EyeSight includes automatic front emergency braking, lane departure and sway warnings, and lane keep assist; it is not offered on models with the five-speed manual transmission.\n\nAll models have a fresh face for 2020 from a new grille and front bumper, and standard automatic door locks.\n\nOn the Sport sedan, the CVT is now standard and the five-speed manual is listed as a no-cost option; the base price jumps $1,315 to $24,395. The manual remains standard on the Sport hatchback; the CVT is optional (and includes EyeSight) for $1,100 more.\n\nThe Sport sedan and Limited models also gain as standard the Si-Drive powertrain management system with Sport and Intelligent modes. Blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert are newly standard on the Limited.\n\nAll models come with a 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine with 152 horsepower and standard all-wheel drive. The five-speed manual is standard on the base sedan and hatchback and the Sport hatchback. All others come with the CVT, which on Premium, Sport and Limited models adds a seven-speed manual mode with paddle shifters.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMore Subaru Impreza News\nResearch the 2020 Subaru Impreza\nFind a 2020 Subaru Impreza Near You\nFind Your Perfect Match\n\nStandard AWD and, for 2020, the Eyesight safety package on all automatic transmission models, makes the Impreza a worthy choice among compacts in the snow belt. It isn’t among the most refined in its class, but it has decent ride and handling, sufficient passenger space for four people and reasonable starting prices in the base and Premium trim levels.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2011 about the 2012 Subaru Impreza. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2012 Subaru Impreza’s most compelling attributes are evident before you even start the engine. Take a glance and you’ll see more mature styling in both the sedan and four-door hatchback. Get inside and you’ll find excellent sightlines, roominess and improved quality. Look at the specifications and you’ll see impressive mileage for a car in the compact class — especially for one with Subaru’s signature standard all-wheel drive: 27/36 mpg city/highway. If you like what you see so far, driving the Impreza probably won’t deter you, but it won’t close the deal, either.\n\nThe 2012 Subaru Impreza undeniably has broader appeal than ever before, but there are still downsides associated with its standard all-wheel drive, not just in terms of price.\n\nBoth body styles come in three trim levels: 2.0i (base), 2.0i Premium and 2.0i Limited. The hatchback, which Subaru calls the “5-door,” adds two more levels: the 2.0i Sport Premium and 2.0i Sport Limited.\n\nSubaru has discontinued the Outback Sport, a butched-up hatchback modeled after the larger Outback SUV. The turbocharged WRX and WRX STI versions continue as they were in 2011; they’re 2012 models but not redesigns. All new Imprezas hit dealerships in November.\n\nExterior\nTo the outside observer, little distinguishes the Impreza’s various trim levels. The base side mirrors are black-colored and fold, and the door handles are body-colored. Fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers are standard. The hatchback includes a spoiler atop its liftgate.\n\nThe Premium trim level adds 16-inch alloy wheels and body-colored side mirrors. The Sport Premium hatchback adds fog lights, rocker panel extensions, black roof rails and 17-inch gunmetal-gray alloy wheels. Two-tone body color is optional.\n\nThe Limited trim level adds chrome accents to the fog lights and grille, and the Sport Limited hatchback incorporates silver grille accents instead.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nI believe the greatest obstacle facing Impreza shoppers is the car’s power. The new, smaller engine is less powerful than the previous generation’s power plant. Though the base car has shed 165 pounds and the new automatic transmission manages to shave a few tenths off the 2011 model’s zero-to-60-mph time, it remains just under 10 seconds. Major competitors beat that by as much as 3 seconds. This is what you might expect from a highly efficient new take on an existing model, but the even more efficient Hyundai Elantra – winner of our recent Cars.com Shootout — is about a second quicker. What’s behind this? The additional weight of the Impreza’s standard all-wheel drive certainly plays a part.\n\nI’m no horsepower freak. Cars that some deem underpowered I instead call modestly powered. Still, if you load up the 2012 Impreza and/or take to the hills — especially at higher altitudes where the air is thinner — the normally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder will have its work cut out for it. Subaru says the regular Impreza won’t get a turbocharger. That’s left for the WRX and STI, which come at a substantial premium.\n\nOn the upside, when the Impreza’s horizontally opposed engine is earning its keep, it sounds quite good — by no means quiet, but deep and refined when compared with the frenetic whine or gravelly rasp many small four-bangers emit.\n\nReplacing the previous generation’s optional four-speed automatic is a continuously variable automatic transmission. It’s standard on the Limited trim level and optional on all others for $1,000.\n\nCVT: A-OK\nWe at Cars.com haven’t warmed to CVTs because of their typical hesitation and the droning they elicit from engines. Like most automatics, CVTs are at their worst when teamed with small engines, so I was wary of this one, which Subaru describes as a more compact version of the one in the Outback and Legacy.\n\nOverall, I was relieved. Though the car takes a few seconds to really get going from a standing start, it feels natural enough. Likewise, the lag when you jab the accelerator for passing power is acceptable. Sometimes you don’t even notice it. The engine provides enough oomph at lower engine speeds that it need not rev up to the heavens at the slightest request for power. More than some CVTs, the Impreza’s allows the engine to wind down pretty quickly when you let off the gas, giving it a more natural feel like a conventional transmission does when it shifts up a gear after a quick sprint. The CVT also has an effective hill-hold feature so you can take your foot off both pedals when waiting on an incline, and the car won’t roll backward.\n\nA CVT has truly succeeded if the average driver can hop in, drive and never know there’s anything different about it. The Impreza isn’t quite there, but it’s as close as any four-cylinder/CVT combo I’ve driven, and maybe closer.\n\nAnyone who wants to pretend he’s driving a regular automatic can use the steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles to select “gears” sequentially. They aren’t gears as much as six fixed ratios along the CVT’s wide range.\n\nIf you want a true manual, you can get that, too, standard on all trim levels but the Limited. The five-speed has a light clutch pedal and a journeyman shifter and is pleasant enough to use, but the advantages are fewer than ever. Yes, it will save you $1,000, but the mileage advantage is gone — 25/34 mpg versus 27/36 mpg with the automatic, in the sedan. (The manual hatchback gets 1 mpg less on the highway.)\n\nThe transmission also needs another gear, both for efficiency and performance’s sake. As manual transmissions’ mileage advantage slips away, I suspect automakers will learn that they appeal mainly to those who simply want to drive a manual, and those buyers will demand more performance, not less. The manual 2012 Impreza doesn’t fit that description.\n\nApart from the manual gearbox’s inherent limitations, it teams with a simpler, viscous-coupling all-wheel-drive system rather than the automatic’s sophisticated electronically controlled clutch-based hardware. The latter can apportion 100 percent of the power to the front or rear axle while the manual splits it 50/50. This is the norm across Subaru’s other models (except the high-performance STI), in which I’ve found both systems to be excellent in snow and off-road. Most drivers wouldn’t perceive a difference.\n\nRide & Handling\nMy first drive of the 2012 Impreza was on dry, warm pavement, where both the 16- and 17-inch alloy wheels lent a comfortable ride. (I didn’t drive the base 15-inch steel wheels.) You’re always aware of the road surface, but the harshest impacts are damped out, and I wasn’t fatigued after a day of driving. Subaru has clearly softened the car for 2012, as it has done in recent models, including the WRX. Unfortunately, with the softening has come pronounced body roll — a shortcoming that is not the inevitable trade-off we once accepted from more compliant suspensions. Note that a rear stabilizer bar comes in the Premium and higher trim levels I drove, so the base 2.0i can only be worse in this regard.\n\nThe Yokohama Avid all-season tires provided enough grip that the car held on through winding roads with no drama, and the electric power steering is among the better executions in this class. The car’s limits aren’t easily found, thanks to the all-wheel drive, but it felt to me like something was missing. Even without the opportunity to slide about, the nose felt heavy, and the body roll made me feel like I was pushing a car to do something for which it wasn’t intended. Will sportiness be the sole province of the WRX and STI?\n\nA Larger, Classier Cabin\nAt a time in automotive history when vehicles’ shoulder lines are getting high enough to make a submariner claustrophobic, the 2012 Impreza is more like a skiff. The 2012’s windowsills are almost 2.5 inches lower in the front than they were in the 2011 model. The dashboard sits lower, and the driver sits almost an inch higher. Even though the A-pillars emerge from farther out on the hood, they’re narrow enough not to obstruct one’s vision. The side mirrors are large, and the over-the-shoulder view is good with either body style. This is all great for normal driving, but I’d still like to see optional parking sensors or a backup camera — features that are making their way into compact cars but aren’t available here.\n\nShorter drivers will love the low hoodline and generous range of seat-height adjustment. Everyone will appreciate the same from the tilt/telescoping steering wheel. For its class, the Impreza has ample front headroom and legroom. While the backseat’s legroom specification doesn’t seem exceptional, it’s nearly 2 inches more than the previous generation, and I found it uncommonly accommodating for someone who’s 6 feet tall. Credit goes to the shape and softness of the front seatbacks. With the front seats fully back, my knees pushed into them, but I didn’t feel squeezed. There’s no backseat center armrest except in the top trim level, however, and the backrest angle isn’t adjustable, even in the hatchback version. The center floor hump is high, too, when compared with some front-drive compacts.\n\nThe 2012’s cabin quality improves markedly over the 2011’s. Silvery plastic is sparse. The center control panel bezel and steering-wheel spokes are a higher-quality gray material. The headliner isn’t woven fabric, but it’s not as cheap-looking as traditional mouse fur. Likewise, though the sun visors are still vinyl, gone are the sharp seams and general cheapness of the past.\n\nThere are more soft surfaces than before, including the entire dashboard as well as the armrests and other so-called touch points. The center console remains hard and simple but does the job. The Limited offers leather for the first time in an Impreza. Just because a car has leather doesn’t mean it’s well-done, but it is in the Impreza.\n\nThe sedan’s trunk is still on the small side at 12 cubic feet, but it’s 6 percent larger than in the 2011, and the hinges don’t encroach on the cargo area. The hatch’s cargo area is wide, low and easy to load. Twelve cubic feet are available under the optional retractable cargo cover, and there’s 22.5 cubic feet behind the backseat, otherwise. The total volume is 52.4 cubic feet with the backseat folded.\n\nFeatures\nAs of its launch, the 2012 Impreza’s starting price is unchanged at $17,495 for the sedan ($500 more for the hatchback in all cases), but a comparison shows a few things have been sacrificed — most notably cruise control. Standard features on the 2.0i include power locks, side mirrors and door locks with one-touch up/down operation for the driver. Also included are air conditioning, 65/35-split folding backseat, a driver’s seat height adjustment, floormats, auto-off headlights, 15-inch steel wheels, a locking glove compartment, dual visor vanity mirrors, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and variable intermittent wipers. The hatchback includes a rear wiper/washer as well.\n\nThe standard AM/FM/CD stereo on both body styles offers no connectivity for portable players. The only option at this level is the automatic transmission.\n\nThe Premium trim level ($18,795 for the sedan) adds 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, body-colored side mirrors, fog lights, chrome interior door handles, a sliding center armrest, a rear stabilizer bar and, for the hatchback, a retractable cargo cover. The stereo adds a USB port and analog auxiliary jack along with iPod connectivity and Bluetooth for audio streaming and hands-free cellular. Audio controls join the cruise control buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nThe sole individual option for the Premium is the automatic. Various packages allow you to add 17-inch alloy wheels, a leather steering wheel and shifter knob, and a stainless-steel tailpipe for the sedan. The All-Weather Package has heated front seats and side mirrors and a wiper de-icer. The Premium is also eligible for a voice-activated navigation system, whose 6.1-inch touch-screen display also supports iTunes tagging, text messaging and XM Satellite Radio and Navtraffic (subscriptions required).\n\nThe 2.0i Sport Premium hatchback ($20,295) comes with gunmetal-gray 17-inch wheels, rocker panel extensions, black roof rails (cross-bars sold separately), fog lights, sport cloth upholstery and the All-Weather Package.\n\nThe 2.0i Limited sedan ($21,595), hatchback ($22,095) and Sport Limited hatchback ($22,595) add the automatic as standard equipment, along with 17-inch alloy wheels; chrome on the door handles, grille trim and fog lights; leather upholstery; automatic climate control, a backseat armrest; auto-on/off headlights; and the All-Weather Package. The stereo gets a 4.3-inch LCD screen, though it’s replaced if you choose the navigation system, which is packaged with the moonroof.\n\nA loaded Impreza Sport Limited hatchback tops out at $25,345 including the $750 destination charge.\n\nMissing features found elsewhere in this vehicle class include keyless access and push-button start, automatic locking and any type of parking assist.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the all-new Impreza hasn’t been crash-tested. The WRX retains its Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway safety, having earned top scores of Good in all the tests, but its results don’t represent or foretell the redesigned Impreza’s crashworthiness.\n\nThe Impreza has seven airbags: the frontal pair, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front occupants and side curtains that cover the front and rear door windows. The seventh is a new driver’s knee airbag.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes are standard. As is federally mandated for all 2012 models, the Impreza also has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. The front seats have active head restraints that also adjust forward and back across five positions. Click here for the full list of safety features.\n\nImpreza in the Market\nThe improved Impreza stands to steal buyers away from brands that have taken their eyes off the ball. Its interior quality has jumped, right when some class leaders have foolishly allowed their interiors and feature sets to decay. By upping the mileage, Subaru has addressed one of the shortcomings of having standard all-wheel drive, but the Impreza doesn’t improve much on the pricing. Say what you will of the dumbed-down Volkswagen Jetta; at least it came with a price decrease.\n\nTo truly excel in the compact-car market, the Impreza needs to convince buyers that the all-wheel drive for which they’ll pay a premium has advantages beyond foul-weather traction. While all-wheel drive can provide this advantage in sporty cars, I fear the 2012’s body roll and modest power keep it from doing so.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2017 Impreza is a significant redesign for Subaru. Not only is it the first Impreza built in the U.S. (in Indiana), it’s also the first to ride on Subaru’s new Global Platform, which will eventually be used throughout the lineup. The new model still comes in sedan and hatchback versions, but both have grown about 1.6 inches longer for 2017.\n\nThe Subaru Impreza competes against sedans like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Hyundai Elantra; compare them here. The hatchback version goes up against hatchback versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic and Mazda3; compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe previous Subaru Impreza’s styling emitted an air of economy, but the new model sheds that dullness with a look that’s much more upscale and expressive. And though it’s not as evocative as the concept version that debuted in 2015, the production model doesn’t disappoint.\n\nIts wider, lower stance adds a sporty flair, and several distinctive cues have carried over from the concept, including a strong bodyside character line, muscular wheel arches, a larger grille and hook-like LED headlights. Instead of blending into the class, it holds its own solidly next to the Honda Civic’s crisp lines and sharp angles and the Hyundai Elantra’s sweeping, classy curves.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Impreza’s comfort and driving dynamics impress. Bumps are well-damped, and it handles well, with reactive steering, a planted feel at highway speeds and flat cornering. Aside from the CVT drone, it’s pleasant on long trips.\n\nAll-wheel drive is again standard on both the hatch and the sedan, and mileage is similar to the outgoing model. The five-door hatchback with the CVT is EPA-rated 28/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined, lower fuel economy than the automatic Cruze (29/38/32 mpg), the Civic hatch with a CVT (31/40/34 mpg) and the automatic Mazda3 hatch (28/37/31 mpg). The sedan’s fuel economy numbers tell a similar story. With an EPA rating of 28/38/32 mpg, it trails base automatic versions of the Civic sedan and Hyundai Elantra by a couple of mpg, and it nearly matches the Corolla’s mileage.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Premium model’s name is deceiving. It’s a step up from the base model but feels very base inside. Hard plastic lines the cabin, though surfaces are padded in key areas, such as the door armrest. What’s chintziest is the unconvincing faux metal along the dashboard and plastic that’s painted to look like metal near the gear selector. Not fooling anyone.\n  \nThe Limited’s cabin, however, befits its spot at the top of the lineup. Its leather seats and surfaces feel high-end, as does the detail stitching on the dash. It still wears faux-metal plastic paneling, but it looks and feels more believable here. Both models have wider, more bolstered seats than the outgoing car, and they provide long-drive comfort.\n\nIn the backseat, legroom has increased a bit in both the sedan and the hatchback, and I found the backseat roomy except for the middle spot. A narrow seat and large floor hump make it usable only for short trips. By the numbers, both the sedan and hatchback are mid-pack when it comes to rear headroom and legroom.\n\nCargo & Storage\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe new Subaru Impreza is the first vehicle to use Subaru’s next-generation multimedia system. All trim levels offer a standard touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration; I tested the 6.5-inch screen in the Premium and the 8-inch unit in the Limited. Both are straightforward, with a logical menu structure, clear home button, and large tuning and volume knobs. It looks fresh, too, with crisp resolution and modern-looking graphics.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Subaru Impreza earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s top score. Subaru says the Impreza’s collision energy absorption rate is 40 percent better than the old model’s, which also got top safety scores from IIHS and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard. In terms of active safety features, the Impreza is among the more advanced cars in the compact lineup thanks to an optional EyeSight collision avoidance system that’s available on all models except the base version. Newly available safety features include a cruise control that is adaptive, lane-keeping assist, backup automatic braking system and steering-responsive headlights that swivel as the car turns. An automatic high-beam system joins EyeSight on Limited models; the system automatically turns the high beams on and off based on driving conditions. Subaru’s subscription-based Starlink Safety and Connected Services system returns, as well.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nValue is often a high priority for compact-car shoppers, and the Subaru Impreza delivers big there. Prices are up only slightly this year; the hatchback starts at $19,715 (all prices include destination). Similar body-type competitors such as the Mazda3 hatchback ($19,930), Honda Civic hatchback ($20,535) and Chevrolet Cruze hatch ($22,115) start higher and don’t offer all-wheel drive even as an option. The sedan’s value is also strong. With a base price of $19,215, it’s a bit less expensive than the base Civic and Corolla sedans, but costs about $1,000 more than a base Elantra.\n\nWith this redesign, Subaru now has an underdog worth cheering for. The new Subaru Impreza has its quirks, but so did baseball’s ultimate underdog, the World Series Champion Chicago Cubs.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSubaru’s smallest model comes in sedan and wagon forms, with high-performance Impreza WRX editions in each body style. All Impreza models have been restyled for the 2006 model year. A new front-end features smoke-tinted headlights, a mesh grille, a new hood and modified fenders. Imprezas with non-turbocharged engines get a new aluminum hood, and all models have redesigned taillamp clusters.\n\nIn the WRX, a 230-horsepower version of the turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed engine replaces last year’s 227-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The new engine features an Active Valve Control System, which promises improved performance with an automatic transmission. Output of the non-turbo engine has grown from 165 to 173 hp, courtesy of a new i-Active Valve Lift System.\n\nThe entry-level 2.5 RS has been renamed 2.5i. Side-impact airbags with head extensions are now standard in the front seats of all models. An outside temperature gauge is now included. Wagons gain cargo-area utility bars, and an air filtration system is installed in Imprezas with the non-turbo engine.\n\nRegular Impreza models are powered by the same 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder that’s used in the company’s larger Legacy. Imprezas are equipped with full-time all-wheel drive and an antilock braking system.\n\nSubaru also offers the Impreza-based Outback Sport, which is listed with the Outback series in the cars.com Research section.\n(Skip to details on the: Impreza WRX | Impreza WRX STi)\n\nExterior\nSubaru says restyling for the 2006 model year is intended to reflect a new brand identity. A new three-section mesh-type grille is inspired by the Japanese company’s aircraft heritage. Sedans have revised wide-body fenders. Wagons get their own flared fender design, like on prior Impreza models.\n\nInterior\nAll Imprezas seat five people. A ratchet-type height adjustment permits additional vertical movement for the driver. Imprezas include remote keyless entry, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, a CD stereo and embroidered carpeted floormats. Wagons hold 27.9 cubic feet of cargo when the rear seatbacks are up and 61.6 cubic feet when they’re folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubaru’s 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder now develops 173 hp. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. Subaru’s full-time all-wheel-drive system transfers power among the wheels automatically.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags with head extensions are now installed in the front seats. Three-point seat belts are included for all five seating positions. The front seat belts have pretensioners and force limiters. �\n\nImpreza WRX\nPerformance is enhanced in the WRX sedan and wagon for 2006, as the new turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder develops 230 hp and 235 pounds-feet of torque. Previous WRX models used a 2.0-liter engine. A new WRX TR model combines the performance upgrades of standard WRX vehicles with the interior content and exterior trim of the 2.5i sedan to keep the price down. New WRX Limited sedans and sport wagons feature leather seating, a power moonroof, dual-mode heated front seats, heated mirrors and windshield wiper de-icing. The WRX Limited sedan adds a rear spoiler.\n\nWRX chassis upgrades for 2006 include 17-inch wheels with all-season tires and aluminum front-suspension links. The brakes gain larger, ventilated rear discs, and the steering ratio has been quickened. Subaru has attempted to reduce noise by installing an underbody cover and increased sound insulation.\n\nThe Impreza WRX can be equipped with a five-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic. Automatic WRX models feature Variable Torque Distribution all-wheel drive.\n\nNoticeable WRX styling touches include slightly bulged fenders and a large air scoop that feeds cool air to the turbocharger’s intercooler. The hood is made of aluminum. WRX models have a sport-tuned suspension, standard 16-inch alloy wheels and larger front brake discs. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard. A tiny turbo boost gauge sits atop the steering column.\n\nThe Impreza WRX looks the part of a hot performer and delivers the goods, too. Acceleration is strong, especially when passing or merging and the transmission is in the most helpful gear. Engine sounds and vibrations are noticeable but not bothersome.\n\nThe WRX’s taut suspension reacts appropriately by taming the bulk of bumps. Steering is quick and easy for snappy cornering, coupled with satisfying highway stability. Headroom in the front seat is abundant, but elbowroom is limited. Though backseat legroom is a bit cramped, the center position is more appealing than in most small cars. Large headrests impede over-the-shoulder visibility. Back to top�\n\nImpreza WRX STi\nSubaru took a bold performance step in the 2004 model year when it introduced the Impreza WRX STi. Equipped with an intercooled and turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder that produces 300 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque, the WRX STi’s engine mates with a six-speed-manual gearbox. It’s the most powerful Subaru ever sold in North America.\n\nA new steering rack for 2005 promised greater precision. The suspension was revised, and a new helical-type limited-slip front differential and an aero underbody cover were installed.\n\nFor 2006, a steering sensor for the Driver Controlled Center Differential Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system is installed. A new roof vane spoiler, a revised hood scoop and daytime running lights are installed. The WRX STi features high-intensity-discharge headlights and heavy-duty Brembo all-disc brakes.\n\nPerformance tops the list of STi merits, which sends this model into close competition with the hottest Asian-brand compacts. If anything, the WRX STi is so potent that it feels out of character for a small Subaru. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Subaru Impreza could be accused of being a Luddite because this redesigned compact car is lacking in the newer technological features found in its competitors.\n\nI’m a bit of a Luddite — one who opposes technological changes — so I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing in the Subaru. I prefer a straightforward car that I don’t have to decipher before driving. I daresay the Impreza and I got along pretty well.\n\nThe 2012 Impreza, which comes as both a sedan and four-door hatchback, has been completely updated with a new interior and exterior. My test car, a 2.0i Premium sedan, had a standard continuously variable automatic transmission, which is all modern, but it seemed to lack some pep. It had me yearning for a manual transmission, which is standard in the Impreza’s lower trims.\n\nI wanted a stick shift because the Impreza had substantial engine noise in the cabin, making it seem more driver-oriented than the average small car. Hey, some people really like engine noise and maybe they’ll like the accompanying road noise, too. Subarus loyalists will recognize the Impreza’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s fun to drive.\n\nThe 2012 Impreza sedan starts at $17,495. My top-of-the-line test car rang up at $23,914 and included all-wheel drive, which is something respected by those of us in climates that embrace all four seasons.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWith its sharp front end, the redesigned Impreza still looks like a Subaru. There’s a slightly sculpted hood and some good-looking body lines on this sedan. It’s a sharp-looking design that will easily weather changing styles.\n\nThe ease of use for this car is tops. The doors are lightweight, and the handles won’t confound anyone except the smaller babes in your brood. The ceiling is typically low for a small sedan, so beware of head-bonks when getting small kids and babies settled into their child-safety seats in the backseat.\n\nThe trunk is easy to access and holds plenty of groceries. While a single stroller will fit in the trunk, parents will want to check if a double stroller will work back there.\n\nThe 2012 Impreza has a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that uses regular unleaded gas. When paired with the CVT, the Impreza gets an EPA-estimated 27/36 mpg city/highway. With the five-speed manual, its fuel-economy numbers drop to 25/34 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nAlthough the Impreza has been redesigned for 2012, there weren’t enough significant changes to the interior for my tastes. The Impreza keeps the dash simple with knobs for the climate control and a few buttons. Also, the Impreza has an optional navigation system that’s straightforward to use — much like the rest of the car.\n\nThe sedan fit my family of four pretty well. It isn’t the car I’d pick for a three-day road trip, but for all the errands and comings and goings that we do in our daily lives, it was a decent fit.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, everything was within my reach. I had no problems reaching any of the center stack controls, and I didn’t have to do the rearview mirror dance (scoot up to reach and adjust the mirror, scoot back to see if it works, scoot up to readjust …). The standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel helped me find the perfect driving position.\n\nIn the front row there were two cupholders, a glove box and center console that rounded out the storage options. There’s also generous storage in door pockets; they’re big enough for a water bottle and some medium-sized items like a clutch or a bag of trash from Chick-Fil-A. Not that I ever go there; drive-throughs are too technologically advanced.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Impreza has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. A car must earn the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests to receive this safety honor. The Impreza also has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received an overall rating of four stars out of five. It earned five stars in the rollover crash test and four stars in the front- and side-impact crash tests.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Impreza has standard all-wheel drive. In addition, it boasts four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. In the airbag department, the Impreza has seven standard airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the Impreza’s outboard seats. The Latch anchors sit behind flaps in the seats, but it wasn’t as easy to get at them because they were hidden behind seat cushion foam. My kid’s booster seat fit well in the backseat, and there wasn’t any struggle with the seat belt buckles. They are on rigid bases, making them easy to use. Thank you, Subaru! Rear-facing child-safety seats don’t fit as well in the backseat, especially if the driver or front passenger are 5 feet 6 inches or taller.

      "expert_review": "We’re taught to respect people who go through life refusing to compromise, right? Should we respect cars that refuse to compromise?\n\nIf that no-compromise car is a 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX STi, then yes.\n\nYes we should. The word “extreme” is overused, but it applies to the STi, a lumpy little economy sedan with an absurdly huge rear wing, a bulge in the hood that looks as though it came from the Pep Boys bargain bin, and bling-bling gold wheels that are about 10 years out of date.\n\nLike the pimply, pipsqueak kid from middle school who came back from summer vacation with a black belt in karate, Subaru – with the help of its rally racing wing, Subaru Technica International, hence the STi name – turned this Impreza into a serious street fighter. The regular Impreza WRX is tough enough, with all-wheel-drive and a turbocharged, 227-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe WRX STi gets a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 300 horsepower. At least that’s what Subaru says. It feels like more.\n\nBut it isn’t just the engine. The suspension is so stiff that on even mildly rough roads, you’ll appreciate what our ancestors, riding west on those buckboards, endured.\n\nThe engine is loud, but not a particularly good loud. However, the exhaust note is drowned out by the road noise from the fat Bridgestone Potenza radials. So crank up the stereo? There is no stereo. What do you expect for $31,545? A radio? Sorry. Instead, Subaru gives you a button that squirts water to cool the turbocharger.\n\nThe STi is so fast, it’s breathtaking. Handling is phenomenal. From a standing start, the STi launches as hard as any car I’ve driven except for a Super Comp dragster. Subaru claims a 0-to-60 mph time of about five seconds, but several magazines have beat that by a half-second.\n\nActually, the Subaru has everything you need but music. There’s air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, locks and mirrors; you also get a pair of superb bucket seats covered with a nice faux-suede material. The rest of the interior is unremarkable, a reminder that the Impreza is, after all, Subaru’s least expensive car. Fuel mileage, at 18 mpg city, 24 mpg highway, is not terrible. But 91 octane premium gas is strongly recommended.\n\nSubaru’s flat-four engine design – two cylinders lying horizontal on the left, opposite two cylinders on the right – is not an inherently smooth configuration, and the STi idles more roughly than non-Subaru initiates would like. And a flat-four doesn’t rev up to the stratosphere like some inline four-cylinders, such as the Honda S2000’s engine. But it does make a lot of torque – the measure of pulling power – making sane in-town driving uneventful.\n\nBut your right foot always feels as if it’s nudging a hornet’s nest – push harder, and you get an adventure.\n\nThe only competition for the WRX STi is the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, which has 29 fewer horsepower and, with its five-speed manual transmission, one less gear. But the Evo, which is almost as fast, is more pleasant to drive on a daily basis. And there are a few compromises, such as a radio. And compromise can be a good thing.\n\nDisagree? Then the WRX STi is your kind of car.",

      "expert_review": "There’s something forgiving, even therapeutic about grafting a station wagon rear onto a performance car: The back absolves the sins of the front. Here comes rowdy, there goes sensible. If the motto of the mullet haircut is “business up front, party in the back” — well, that’s the Subaru Impreza WRX wagon, only in reverse.\n\nThe WRX is one of the leading purveyors of the whole “pocket rocket” mentality that has long challenged the idea that to have fun, you need (A) a sports car, (B) a V-8 engine and (C) preferably both. Through the magic of a turbocharger — essentially a fan, driven by exhaust gas, that forces the fuel mixture into the engine under pressure — a four-cylinder engine can make V-8 horsepower.\n\nThe Subaru Impreza comes in three basic flavors — the regular Impreza, the speedy WRX, and the beyond-speedy WRX STI, which has 300 horsepower and boy-racer styling that can get a little tiresome. The regular WRX, with 224 horsepower, makes a lot more sense; it’s cheaper, lacks the STI’s log-wagon ride, but still has more than enough performance to add excitement to the daily commute. The STI only comes as a sedan, but the WRX is offered in sedan or wagon trim.\n\nThe wagon is, I think, the better-looking choice, not to mention the more practical one. It’s also ideal for the teenager who tries to convince mom and dad that buying a station wagon, for goodness’ sakes, is a commendably sober, conservative choice for a 16-year-old. Sort of like when I tried to convince my father that all I really needed when I was 16 was a car with a six-cylinder engine, when all my friends were coveting V-8s. The idea got a little traction until he realized the six cylinders were under the hood of a 1967 Jaguar XKE. Game over!\n\nThe test car was a 2007 WRX Limited, which adds leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power sunroof and a few other features to the regular WRX. With all models, the engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder. The test car’s transmission was a very smooth-shifting five-speed manual; an automatic adds $1,000. Fuel mileage is rated at 20 mpg city, 27 mpg highway, premium gas preferred.\n\nAs is every Subaru, the WRX is all-wheel-drive. The WRX suspension is firm, and the ride is taut, but it doesn’t beat you up, even on long trips. The bucket seats are excellent — the WRX Limited is a far better highway car than you would suspect. Rear seat room is rather cramped for adults, especially if tall front passengers have their seats pushed back.\n\nHandling is just excellent, brakes are firm and progressive, and the torquey engine provides plenty of punch. The WRX Limited wagon weighs about 3,300 pounds, but feels lighter on its feet. There’s a moderate amount of road noise from the P205/55VR-16 radial tires, but it isn’t excessive.\n\nThe WRX wagon starts at $24,495, with the leather-clad WRX Limited starting at $26,995. With shipping and a few options, the list price of the test vehicle was $29,109, a little heady for a car that starts out life as a $17,995 Impreza wagon. The level of utility and performance the WRX Limited wagon offers is substantial, though, but whether or not it justifies that substantial price is up to you.",

      "expert_review": "The Subaru Impreza WRX is a great example of a sports car designed for the real world. It’s quick, fun and practical. It’ll carry groceries and your friends, and it won’t attract the attention of every law enforcement officer out there, provided you drive like an adult.\n\nSporty cars are often a compromise because their size or shape require you to leave something or someone behind, or they’re so stiffly sprung — to give you good cornering — that they’re downright painful to drive on slightly imperfect roads. Then there are the dreaded “sporty” cars that only look the part, but in reality are nothing more than normal, practical cars with some fancy body pieces. That’s not the case with the WRX. What it offers is true sports performance plus real world practicality.\n\nThe WRX doesn’t perform both roles perfectly, but if you’re looking for something that’s really fun to drive and doesn’t make you give up everything in your life or drive only butter-smooth roads, this could be the car for you.\n\nGoing, Stopping & Turning\nDoes this thing ever go. The Impreza WRX isn’t the most powerful car I’ve driven, but it’s less about the pure amount of power the engine produces and more about the way it uses it.\n\nThe WRX’s turbocharged, 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine makes 265 horsepower and 244 pounds-feet of torque running on required premium gas. It’s connected to a five-speed manual transmission; the regular Impreza offers an optional automatic transmission, but the WRX doesn’t. The key here is the “turbocharged” bit. What that means is that when you accelerate, you start moving, then — whoosh! The turbo kicks in and you start moving. You’ll be pushed firmly back into your seat, then it’ll be time to shift and   boom! More boost, more power and more getting pushed back into your seat. Time to shift again, and blam! Before you know it, you’re in 5th gear.\n\nThe waiting and whooshing is technically called turbo lag, because there’s not a lot of torque below 3,000 rpm. I enjoyed it in this case; it’s what gives you a moment’s anticipation before the WRX accelerates like mad. Still, one person’s addictive acceleration is another person’s annoying turbo lag. You’ve been warned.\n\nThe flipside to the turbo is that if you want to drive like an adult and just cruise everywhere, you can do that. Just go easy on the throttle, shift early and, presto, you’re coasting down the road to the grocery store like everybody else — nothing to see here, officer. It also delivers a respectable 18/25 mpg city/highway, according to EPA estimates.\n\nStopping, too, is a treat. The braking response is predictable and offers confidence-inspiring stopping power. There’s no sense of, “Is it me, or are we not stopping as quickly as we should?”\n\nThe steering requires a bit of effort when turning in parking lots, but that lightens up once you get above, say, 15 mph. After that, all you notice is that when you turn the wheel, the car responds immediately. There was no play or sloppiness, and that’s a welcome thing. Thanks to the all-wheel drive, you can feel all four wheels grabbing the road and pulling you through turns like claws into the asphalt.\n\nNow, the important thing to remember in all of the above is that I drove the Impreza WRX in the real world, not on a track, but I was still looking for any excuse to drive it, just for the heck of it. That doesn’t always happen with the cars I test.\n\nReal-World Flaws\nAs much as I enjoyed the car’s real-world performance, there are real-world caveats, too. The Impreza WRX has very supportive — but not constraining — seats, but they’re manually adjustable, so if you have to share this car you might miss the convenience of a memory seat feature. It’s not a big deal to me, but it might be to you.\n\nSpeaking of seats, if you’re on the taller side, backseat room is very, very tight. I had the driver’s seat nearly all the way back to drive, and I couldn’t sit comfortably in the backseat with it that way.\n\nVisibility is largely OK, but with one glaring flaw: Despite the fact that there’s a cutout in the rear roof pillar, eliminating a potential blind spot, the rear spoiler interferes with your view. When I first looked in the rearview mirror, I thought someone had opened the trunk. Maybe it’s the sort of thing you get used to? After my week with the car, though, I still did not like that spoiler.\n\nThe trunk is odd, too. There’s a flat section in front, but then it slants upward toward the front of the car, marginally impinging on your space. Also, the trunklid itself has the old-school hinges that come down into the cargo area. If you’re the sort who likes to fill your trunk to the brim, you will have to account for that. Or you could spend an additional $500 for the hatchback version of the WRX and avoid the whole trunk issue altogether.\n\nSome final issues — let’s call them “quirks” — with the WRX include the interaction of the clutch, tall gearing and turbo lag. For one thing, this car is easier to stall than most manuals, as other drivers also noticed. Because of the turbo, it doesn’t make a lot of power at low revs, and 1st gear is relatively high. This means you have to slip the clutch more than you would in many cars (which can lend the clutch a heavy feel and increase driver fatigue in stop-and-go traffic). A six-speed transmission could provide a shorter 1st gear and easier launches.\n\nReal-World Attributes\nAs I’ve said, this is a very comfortable car. One passenger even remarked as much — unprompted. It’s not just the seats, either; I never winced when going over bumps on Chicago’s horrible roads, and expansion joints on the interstate didn’t bash my spine. I was, however, able to sense when the pavement changed, through the steering wheel. I don’t know how Subaru managed to make the WRX provide feedback to the driver, offer sporty handling and still provide a smooth ride, but I’m glad it did.\n\nIn the same vein, Subaru managed to build a car that lets you hear the sounds you want while isolating you from the sounds you don’t. If you find yourself sitting next to a heavy-duty diesel clattering away while you wait for the light to turn green, roll up the window and the noise vanishes. Accelerate away from the light with the window up, and you hear the driveline and turbo whine, accompanied by an acceptable bit of noise from the engine. It’s even better on the highway: Cruise along in 5th, or especially 4th gear, and you can hear not only the driveline, but also a mix of muted road noise, engine growl and whine from the turbo. Trust me, that’s a good thing. You owe it to yourself to go for a long drive with the radio off to appreciate it.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rates regular Impreza models Good (the highest score) in both its frontal and side-impact crash tests. The Impreza WRX comes with standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and side-impact and side curtain airbags. See the full list of safety features here.\n\nWRX in the Market\nOur test model was a Premium trim, which is a step above the base model, and it stickered at $28,835 (including options and $695 for delivery). Turbocharged versions of the WRX have a history of average reliability, slightly below non-turbo Imprezas, which are above average.\n\n(Here’s how the WRX Premium sedan compares to a regular Impreza, and how this year’s model compares to last year’s.)\n\nWhen you factor in its all-wheel drive, the Impreza WRX sits in a pretty rare spot in the market — only the Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart has roughly the same price and performance.\n\nThe key difference to me is the WRX’s all-wheel drive. It makes the Impreza WRX handle so differently, behave so well, that none of the many sporty front- or rear-wheel-drive sedans out there can compare. Yes, there are other sporty all-wheel-drive cars, like the BMW 3 Series, but their price disqualifies them for many buyers.\n\nMany of the cars I like, I have to qualify: “It’s an all right car for a small hatchback,” or, “If you like minivans, it’s OK.” This is one where I can just say it’s a good, fun car — period.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Impreza is available as a sedan or hatchback. Trim levels include the naturally aspirated four-cylinder 2.5i and Outback Sport, as well as turbocharged WRX models. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the Mazda3 and Volkswagen Jetta. A 305-horsepower Impreza WRX STI tops the model line, both in price and in speed.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Impreza Outback Sport, WRX and WRX STI)\n\nNew for 2011\nSubaru has added an optional TomTom navigation system that has a removable 4.3-inch touch screen. The portable nav system is available on the new Outback Sport Special Edition and Impreza 2.5i Premium models. All models except the base Impreza 2.5i have a new audio system with a single-disc CD player, Bluetooth, iPod control and satellite radio capability, and a USB port. The Impreza 2.5 GT model has been discontinued.\n\nExterior\nAll non-Impreza Outback and WRX models are available as either a sedan or hatchback. Hatchback models get clear-lens taillights with red LEDs. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard body-colored door handles and mirrors\nStandard rear lip spoiler (hatchback)\nOptional fog lamps\nOptional power tilt/slide glass sunroof\n16-inch wheels standard\nOptional 17-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe interior has a businesslike austerity to it. Metallic inlays flank the center controls, and the center console houses an optional navigation system. All models come with a 60/40-split folding backseat. The hatch gets a cargo area cover and tie-down hooks. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard cruise control\nStandard power windows and locks\nOptional automatic climate control\nOptional leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter\nOptional portable touch screen navigation\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith the demise of the 2.5 GT, all Imprezas now come with a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Mechanical features include:\n\n170-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 170 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission\nStandard all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nAll Imprezas include an impressive array of safety features. They include:\n\nStandard side-impact and side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with traction control\nStandard antilock brakes with brake-force distribution and brake assist\nStandard hill start assist (manual versions only)\nStandard daytime running lamps\n\nImpreza Outback Sport\nThe Impreza Outback Sport is a more rugged Impreza, similar to how Volvo distinguishes the V70 from the XC70. It’s only available as a four-door hatchback featuring a two-tone appearance, with the lower section of the body a contrasting silver hue.\n\nA new Special Edition Model available with a portable TomTom navigation system with a removable 4.3-inch touch screen has been added as an option for 2011.\n\n170-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 170 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission\nHeavy-duty raised suspension\n17-inch alloy wheels\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter\nHeated front seats\n10-speaker surround-sound system Back to top\n\nSubaru WRX\nThe WRX has adopted the 2010 STI model’s wider body and more aggressive exterior.\n\nBecause the current-generation STI had been available only as a hatchback, the wide-body styling appears on a sedan for the first time this year in both the WRX sedan and an all-new STI sedan. It includes wider fenders and squared-off bumpers. The grille is now black; gone is the previous model year’s chrome bar. Carrying over from last year are a prominent hood scoop, to funnel air into the turbo’s intercooler, and a spoiler on the hatchback’s liftgate. The WRX sedan has an optional spoiler on the trunklid that’s more subtle than the STI’s. The sedan’s taillights are red, whereas the hatch has clear lenses.\n\nThe widening isn’t limited to the body. The distance between the left and right wheels, known as the vehicle’s track, is 1.5 inches wider. The WRX’s suspension is firmer than the regular Impreza’s, and for 2011 it has slight changes, including firmer rear bushings. The standard wheels are 17 inches, and this year they’re 8 inches wide, up from 7 inches, for more grip.\n\nAll WRX models employ a turbocharged version of Subaru’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder that generates 265 hp and 244 pounds-feet of torque. A five-speed manual is the only transmission, and the standard all-wheel drive uses a viscous coupling center differential rather than the more sophisticated system that works with an automatic transmission in the more modest Imprezas.\n\nThe WRX’s interior is distinguished from other Imprezas by sport seats with checkered black cloth upholstery with red accent stitching. The pedals and dead pedal have aluminum alloy covers.\n\nThe leather steering wheel tilts and telescopes, and it incorporates buttons for the cruise control and audio system. A new single-CD stereo adds Bluetooth audio streaming and hand-free cellular capability along with USB and analog jacks for controlling or simply playing an MP3 player through the stereo. Other standard features include remote keyless entry and automatic climate control. Satellite radio and a navigation system are options. The WRX Premium adds heated seats and side mirrors, a moonroof and projector-beam fog lights. The WRX Limited adds leather upholstery and xenon headlights. Back to top\n\nSubaru WRX STI\nThe STI version of the WRX now comes as a sedan for the first time in this generation. For 2011 its suspension is retuned with higher spring rates and thicker stabilizer bars and remains a step firmer and more performance oriented than the regular WRX’s. Its version of the turbo-four produces 305 hp and 290 pounds-feet of torque. Its six-speed manual joins a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system with limited-slip front and rear differentials. The center differential has three driver-selectable performance modes and variable torque distribution settings. The brakes use Brembo-brand four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers. The alloy wheels measure 18 by 8.5 inches. The STI has quad tailpipes — enlarged to 3 inches in diameter — and the sedan has a huge rear wing spoiler. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "In its most basic form, Subaru’s compact Impreza upholds the most rudimentary tenets of A-to-B transportation: capability, comfort and utility. Its cabin feels thoroughly basic, and a few must-have features are missing, but I suspect that months or even years after buying one, the car’s workhorse qualities will make many drivers glad they chose it.\n\nWith two body styles, four engines and multiple trim levels, there are more than a dozen Impreza variants. All come with standard all-wheel drive. Stack them up here, or compare the 2010 and 2009 Impreza here. I drove an Impreza 2.5i Premium hatchback with an automatic transmission.\n\nFamiliar Shape\nThe Impreza has a a clean — if forgettable — design, and unlike some rivals, even the base 2.5i trim has dual tailpipes and body-colored mirrors and door handles. The sedan has aged better than the hatchback, whose frosted taillights became passé around the same time MySpace did. Alloy wheels go on all but the 2.5i trim, while the gussied-up Outback Sport adds two-tone paint and a raised, heavy-duty suspension. (In Subaru tradition, the Outback Sport is based on the Impreza; it shares only its name with the larger Outback wagon.) The turbocharged Impreza 2.5GT, WRX and WRX STi add a functional hood scoop.\n\nThe Outback Sport and WRX STi come only as hatchbacks; all other trims are available as hatchbacks or sedans. Though both cars share the same wheelbase and turning circle — a decent 34.8 feet — urban drivers may want to go with the hatchback, as it’s 6.5 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the sedan.\n\nPlain, Purposeful\nYou can’t expect a sub-$20,000 interior to match up to what you see in glossy car ads, but the Impreza’s feels low-rent, even for this league. Materials are plain — an unpadded center armrest, acres of shiny dashboard plastic, a cardboard-grade headliner. Little things, from the keyless entry remote to the wiper stalks, are of a tinny, cheap quality. A telescoping steering wheel, which a lot of competitors offer standard, requires stepping up to a turbocharged model, and the stereo’s old-school readout displays only the first few words of song titles. For similar dough, there are more upscale cabins out there — like the Mazda3, Honda Civic and Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nThe Impreza finds its redemption through practicality. Everything just plain works: The tall windows and narrow pillars offer excellent sight lines. The gauges are cleanly organized, with a dummy-proof blue light that indicates when the engine is too cold for you to crank up the heat. The seats have supportive cushioning and a respectable grade of cloth, and my test car’s optional seat heaters worked quickly and stayed hot all day. I’m driving a Lexus RX 350 this week, and its tepid seat heaters have me missing Subaru’s.\n\nHeadroom up front is good, even with the optional moonroof. Taller drivers may want more rearward seat travel; I’m 5-foot-11, and I drove with the seat all the way back. A height-adjustable driver’s seat is standard. Bear in mind the Impreza’s WRX and WRX STi trims have shapelier seats, so my impressions of cushioning and fabric quality don’t apply there.\n\nThe backseat has decent headroom and, for this class, adequate legroom. The seat cushions are rather low to the ground, though, and taller passengers will find their knees pointing up. Amenities are limited, too: Non-turbo models lack a center armrest, and the rear seats don’t recline or move forward and backward. Behind the backseat in the hatchback is a competitive 19 cubic feet of cargo space. The seat folds down simply in a 60/40 split to form a flat, ledge-free load floor, but maximum cargo volume is 44.4 cubic feet — on the low end in this group.\n\nHatchback Cargo Utility Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind rear seats\tSeats folded\nVolkswagen Jetta SportWagen\t32.8\t66.9\nHyundai Elantra Touring\t24.3\t65.3\nScion xB\t21.7\t69.9\nToyota Matrix\t19.8\t48.9\nSubaru Impreza hatchback\t19.0\t44.4\nMazda3 hatchback\t17.0\t42.8\nVolkswagen Golf (4-door)\t15.0\t46.0\nMitsubishi Lancer Sportback\t13.8\t46.6\nSource: Automaker data for 2010 models\n\nThe Impreza sedan’s trunk measures 11.3 cubic feet, which is also on the smaller side. The Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla have 12-plus cubic feet, and the Ford Focus boasts nearly 14 cubic feet.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThough it’s the least powerful of the four engines offered, the Impreza’s normally aspirated, 170-horsepower four-cylinder moves the car quickly enough. It’s on the larger side of four-cylinder engines in this class, and the resulting oomph comes handy at any speed — especially given the fact that the car’s standard all-wheel drive bumps curb weight to just over 3,000 pounds. That’s a few hundred pounds more than a lot of front-wheel-drive competitors.\n\nMost Imprezas employ a standard five-speed manual transmission; my test car had a four-speed automatic. It delivers swift kickdown on the highway, but some gear changes bog down a bit during shifts. Sustained acceleration at lower speeds reveals longish second and third gears — the unavoidable result of having just four gears to choose from — and the automatic’s Sport mode, engaged by moving the shifter to the left of Drive, only drags these out longer. As strong as the engine is, I can’t help but think a responsive five- or six-speed automatic could do wonders to unlock its potential.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard. With the manual, EPA-estimated gas mileage is 20/27 mpg city/highway; with the automatic it’s 20/26 mpg. Those figures are competitive with the all-wheel-drive Toyota Matrix — the only major competitor to offer all-wheel drive on hoi polloi trim levels — but the mileage figures are nowhere close to those of front-wheel-drive competitors. EPA highway mileage estimates for the Civic, Focus and Corolla, for example, are in the mid-30s.\n\nTurbocharged Impreza models include the 224-hp 2.5GT, 265-hp WRX and 305-hp WRX STi. We’ve driven the 2.5GT and WRX with stick shifts, and both offer punchy acceleration. Gas mileage with the turbo engines takes a modest hit, however, and all three require premium fuel. Here’s how they stack up:\n\nImpreza Engines Compared\n \t2.5i, Outback Sport\t2.5GT\tWRX\tWRX STi\nEngine\t2.5-liter four-cylinder\t2.5-liter turbo four-cylinder\t2.5-liter turbo four-cylinder\t2.5-liter turbo four-cylinder\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t170 @ 6,000\t224 @ 5,200\t265 @ 6,000\t305 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft., @ rpm)\t170 @ 4,400\t226 @ 2,800\t244 @ 4,000\t290 @ 4,000\nTransmission\t5-speed man., 4-speed auto\t4-speed auto\t5-speed man.\t6-speed man.\nEPA mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t20/27 (man.); 20/26 (auto)\t19/24\t18/25\t17/23\nRequired fuel\tRegular\tPremium\tPremium\tPremium\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nMy test car’s all-wheel drive worked flawlessly all week, delivering slip-free acceleration over considerable snow and ice. The Impreza employs three all-wheel-drive systems: Stick-shift models short of the STi distribute power continuously to both axles through a center viscous coupling, while models with an automatic transmission have a more advanced center differential that electronically doles out the engine power. Either way, power goes continuously to both axles, which contrasts with conventional on-demand systems that send power rearward only when it’s needed. (The STi employs the third system — a rear-biased coupling that can be adjusted to separate modes.)\n\nEqually impressive are the Impreza’s brakes. Four-wheel antilock discs are standard; the pedal delivers progressive, controllable deceleration, making it easy to smooth out your stops. The 2.5GT, WRX and WRX STi have beefier braking hardware.\n\nRide & Handling\nPast Subarus have ridden on the firmer side, but the company is taking a softer approach with its current products. That’s evident in the Impreza, whose base suspension rivals the segment’s best in terms of overall ride comfort — namely, the Corolla. My test car traversed winter-disheveled pavement with the aplomb I’d expect in a midsize family car. Only over extended stretches of bumpy asphalt did it start to lose its cool, but that’s often unavoidable in small cars with short wheelbases.\n\nAlso impressive is that the Impreza combines this comfort with pretty sharp handling. The steering wheel requires a bit more effort to turn at low speeds than most compact cars do, but it transmits decent feedback and good turn-in precision at higher speeds. On the highway, the wheel feels sufficiently weighty at 12 o’clock; the car tracks well, as this class goes, and you won’t find yourself making constant, fidgety corrections.\n\nIf you’re into carving corners, the Impreza does so with noticeable body roll, and at its limits it feels as nose-heavy as any of its front-wheel-drive rivals. But even then, it handles predictably — ease off the gas, and it’s easy enough to nudge the nose back onto its intended path.\n\nTurbocharged Imprezas get larger wheels and sport-tuned suspensions; both will undoubtedly affect ride and handling. We’ve reviewed the 2.5GT and WRX, however, and neither rides too firm. (The normally aspirated Outback Sport, meanwhile, has a raised, heavy-duty suspension with 0.2 inches higher ground clearance. That will affect things, too, but we haven’t evaluated it.)\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nWith top scores in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests, the 2010 Impreza earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — no longer an easy feat, given the IIHS’ addition of roof-strength evaluations this year. The list of standard safety features includes six airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system; that last feature is both important and impressive, given that less than half the major nameplates in this segment include a standard stability system. Click here for a full list of the Impreza’s safety features.\n\nParents with small children will note that the top-tether anchors reside at the very back of the cargo area — not a convenient spot if you want to store groceries or luggage in back when there’s a child seat strapped into the second row. Both outboard backseat positions include lower Latch anchors.\n\nReliability is a bit of a mixed bag. The current-generation WRX and WRX STi are rated Worse Than Average and Average, respectively, in Consumer Reports’ reliability surveys. The normally aspirated Impreza sedan is rated Average, but the normally aspirated Impreza hatchback scores Much Better Than Average. Go figure.\n\nThe base Impreza 2.5i starts at $17,495 — a lot for a small car, but all-wheel drive adds to the cost. It’s fairly well-equipped, with standard power windows and locks, cruise control, a basic CD stereo, air conditioning and remote keyless entry. The automatic adds $1,000, and moving to a hatchback runs another $500. (Remember, the automatic is standard on the 2.5GT and unavailable on the WRX or WRX STi, and the STi comes only as a hatchback.) Among the options are an upgraded stereo with steering-wheel audio controls, USB/iPod stereo integration, a moonroof, heated seats, leather upholstery and a navigation system. It bears mentioning that here, as in a few other Subarus, you can get heated seats covered in cloth as well as leather.\n\nCapping off the range is the $32,995 WRX STi; load it up, and the Impreza tops out near $40,000.\n\nImpreza in the Market\nCabin quality aside, practicality is king at Subaru, and the Impreza has no shortage of it. This has been a winning formula for the brand, if its sales success in a tough market is any indication. Arguably more so than any other automaker, Subaru has managed to minimize the inherent drawbacks of all-wheel drive — namely, a higher price tag, more weight and lower gas mileage — to make its advantages all the more attractive. For those who have to deal with snow, ice or hilly terrain, the Impreza deserves a lot of consideration. Shoppers who don’t need all-wheel drive, however, shouldn’t be lured: Competitors still deliver better gas mileage and a lower starting price.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "While the hot WRX may garner the most headlines for Subaru’s Impreza line, the four-door with a 2.5-liter engine will be the bread-and-butter model.\n\nThe Impreza was redesigned for 2008. While the five-door hatchback has a unique shape, the sedan has a more traditional profile. The new design has a greater presence, in part because of the crisp side body crease and a wide grille opening.\n\nThe new Impreza takes a big step forward in terms of comfort and utility. Subaru vehicles have a reputation for impressive all-weather performance because all-wheel drive is standard on all vehicles. That sets the Impreza 2.5i apart from competitors such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Cobalt. Vehicle stability control and anti-lock brakes are standard as well.\n\nThe base price of the Impreza sedan with a five-speed manual transmission begins at $17,640. The test car, with satellite radio and a navigation system, had a sticker price of $22,825.\n\nThe new 2.5-liter normally aspirated engine delivers 170 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque. Low-end torque and fuel efficiency have been improved by the addition of a new intake port and a new catalyst system.\n\nThe Subaru four-cylinder is a horizontally opposed design whose cylinders are flat. This layout, similar to that of a Porsche or an air-cooled Volkswagen, keeps the weight low and improves the center of gravity. That in turn results in a vehicle with good balance and handling.\n\nFuel economy is rated at 20 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway.\n\nWhile the base Impreza is no sports sedan, it does feel solid in turns because of the low center of gravity. The engine, often called a boxer, is generally not quite as smooth as an inline engine.\n\nThe Impreza’s interior design emphasizes comfort and space. Sweeping trim pieces of brushed aluminum flow into the center console. The large LCD screen for the optional satellite radio and navigation system is placed up high where it is easy to read. Input jacks accommodate MP3 players or portable gaming devices that can be played on the navigation screen when the car is not in motion.\n\nThe shape of the center console adds to the cabin’s feeling of spaciousness. The door panels, sculpted to give additional width, have holders for large water bottles. Shoulder width is up by 2 inches.\n\nSubaru said it has improved the quality of interior materials with double-stitched fabrics and high-grade plastic pieces.\n\nDoor openings are larger for easier entry, and window frames add to the body’s rigidity as well as reduce wind noise.\n\nThe back doors open out 75 degrees to make it easier to get into the back seat. Subaru said the rear seatback has been reclined for more comfortable seating. Legroom in back is greater, too. The trunk has plenty of room, too.\n\nSafety features include front airbags and side airbags that are designed to protect the head and chest.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $21,495. Options included sport trim and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with a compass. The sticker price was $22,825.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles, with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter, 170-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,131 lbs.\n\nBase price: $21,495\n\nAs driven: $22,825\n\nMPG rating: 20 city, 27 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",
