      "expert_review": "The 2015 Subaru BRZ is one of the purest performance cars you can buy, with an intoxicating formula of perfect weight balance, precise steering and responsive throttle, all experienced in a sporty cockpit. Plus, it’s a relative bargain.\n\nFor 2015, the BRZ has revised shock absorbers for improved handling, according to Subaru, as well as larger tailpipes. There’s a new limited-edition Series.Blue version, of which only 1,000 will be sold in the U.S. This is the version we tested. Compare the 2014 and 2015 versions here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThis small package has sporty lines and an aggressive stance, but it’s really the shapely front that speaks to us. While cars of every stripe are getting larger, taller, more vertical grilles and front ends, the BRZ is sticking to a traditionally low-slung front bumper.\n\nThe rather traditional sports-car looks are disturbed only by a small inset behind the front wheels, where a functional air inlet might be (but isn’t). We’re unsure why this is needed visually, because there’s no practical reason for it to be there.\n\nSeries.Blue models come in only two exterior colors, blue or white, and include 17-inch black wheels, red brake calipers, an aerodynamic body kit and a rear spoiler. It looks good in the white we tested for this review; it was frequently ogled on the street.\n\nHow It Drives\nMost car enthusiasts and sports-car shoppers focus on power first, everything else second. If you look at power numbers, though, the BRZ seems downright miserable. A V-6 Ford Mustang seems more appealing, given it has 100 more horsepower.\n\nBut here’s the thing: You really don’t need more power in a car that handles as superbly as the BRZ. I spent considerable time in the BRZ as a long-term test car in 2013, as well as with the 2015 Series.Blue, and there’s only one time I thought it ever felt underpowered — and that was on the straightaway of one of the fastest racetracks in the country, Road America in Wisconsin.\n\nIn every other instance, including smaller road courses, the BRZ has plenty of power. When equipped with the manual transmission — we don’t recommend the automatic — acceleration is immediate and delivered with a throaty induction note to boot.\n\nThe power really isn’t the thing that makes everyone fall in love with the BRZ, anyway. It’s the handling. Oh, the handling.\n\nWant to feel connected to a machine when taking a highway off-ramp — let alone a racetrack? Then you want a BRZ. Its precision and sharp turning really put the car in a class of its own, with the lightweight frame and rear-wheel drive adding up to what at times feels like an amusement-park ride.\n\nInterior\nThat feeling of “pure” performance is enhanced by the car’s stripped-down — yet driver-oriented — cockpit. There aren’t many, if any, frills in the BRZ. The sport seats hold you snugly and the gauges are simply laid out, with a large tachometer and digital speedometer meant for the business of driving.\n\nThe car’s materials aren’t stellar, but they align with the quality you’d expect in a car at this price. The Series.Blue treatment added blue leather seat bolsters and accent stitching to our test car. Subaru’s other performance halos, the WRX and WRX STI, basically have compact car interiors, and this is a step above those at a lesser price.\n\nWhile the driver feels snug and secure, though — becoming “one with the car” — passengers will likely long to leave the tight confines. Rear passengers will barely be able to fit at all, depending on their height, and will have to contort feet, legs and necks in most instances.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe driver may be the most important person in the car, but that doesn’t mean that person is going to be pampered. The BRZ’s bare-bones, driver-focused design has sore points. For example, a driver often wants a center armrest, especially on long drives, and the BRZ does not have one.\n\nThen there’s the awful multimedia system interface that has not been improved since the car’s introduction. With the lack of audio controls on the steering wheel — it’s a pure driver’s car, remember — drivers are left to stab at the small touch-screen to do things as simple as skip an audio track. It’s impossible to do so without taking your eyes off the road, which a skilled driver would not want to do. Tip: Don’t play music on shuffle in the BRZ.\n\nThe multimedia system itself is far behind almost anything on the market these days in terms of both user interface and graphics quality. That’s too bad, as Subaru has finally upgraded its technology in its other vehicles. The BRZ’s platform, which is shared with Toyota, seems to be the only one that won’t get the benefit of that improvement.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe small storage area in the center console between the passenger and driver is barely large enough for a smartphone and change. Want to take the wallet out of your back pocket to get more comfortable in the firm seats? Good luck finding a place for it that doesn’t leave it to fly around the cabin during those sharp turns you’ll be hunting out.\n\nThe trunk, however, is quite decent, even though the 6.9 cubic-foot measurement is small. There’s plenty of room for luggage and even golf clubs, and the rear seats fold down for added space. We fit a set of four winter tires in our long-term BRZ with the rear seats folded down.\n\nSafety\nThe BRZ is a Top Safety Pick at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, scoring top grades of good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in all tests except the small overlap front test, where it scored acceptable. It also has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThese results should add an extra sense of confidence, because sports cars are seldom crash-tested at all.\n\nYou can find the BRZ’s standard safety equipment listed here.\n\nThe Scion FR-S — a basic twin to the BRZ — is one of the few cars to fail our Car Seat Check because of the extreme bolstering in the backseat and narrow width of the seat bottoms. These results apply to the BRZ as well.\n\nValue in Its Class\nStarting at just over $26,000 including destination and with the preferred manual transmission, the BRZ is a relative steal in terms of fun-to-dollar ratio. But buyers must be prepared for traditional sports-car trade-offs when shopping for one. There are similarly priced cars, like the Volkswagen GTI. That car is fun to drive, has a lot more passenger and cargo room, and it’s faster.\n\nBut it’s almost impossible to find anything that can replicate the BRZ’s symbiotic relationship with its driver at any price.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2017 Subaru BRZ is still an outlier in Subaru’s otherwise all-wheel-drive lineup, but I’m glad; the market for affordable rear-wheel-drive performance cars is already too thin.\n\nFor the new model year, the BRZ gets a long list of updates both styling and mechanical in nature. It’s the biggest set of changes for the BRZ since its inception in 2014. To compare the new BRZ with the 2016 version, click here. It’s sold in two trim levels, Premium and Limited.\n\nThe Subaru BRZ was developed alongside the Scion FR-S, which is now sold as the Toyota 86 (the Scion brand has been discontinued). The two had a lot in common, sharing the same engine and wheelbase, and for 2017 the “Toyobaru” twins continue to move in lockstep. Though their styling updates are different, both cars get similar mechanical updates. The only difference under the skin is the final suspension and steering tuning, which each company does on its own.\n\nIf you’re looking for an affordable rear-wheel-drive sports car, the market is thin. The BRZ competes against the 86 (of course), the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Fiat’s 124 Spider. Those can be compared here.\n\nI tested a 2017 Subaru BRZ Limited in multiple environments, from the congested highways of Los Angeles to steep canyon roads. I even drove it on a racetrack.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe BRZ keeps its same basic shape, so it’s still instantly recognizable despite styling updates all around. It’s like a friend who got a makeover on a reality TV show; you can still tell it’s them, but everything has gotten a bit sharper.\n\nStarting from the ground up, the Subaru BRZ’s standard 17-inch alloy wheels have a new 10-spoke design with black design elements that are very attractive. The front bumper has also been updated, and there are two new standard exterior features for 2017: a rear spoiler and redesigned headlight clusters with LED headlights and daytime running lights. The Limited trim adds standard LED foglights.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nBoth the 86 and the BRZ got a series of mechanical updates for 2017, including a slight power boost for manual models: The 2.0-liter four-cylinder boxer engine now makes 205 horsepower and 156 pounds-feet of torque when paired with the six-speed manual transmission. In BRZs with the six-speed automatic (which is optional only on the Limited), output remains the same, at 200 hp and 151 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nManual models also get a new incline start assist system that holds the Subaru BRZ in position on an incline, to prevent rollback, until the driver gives it enough power to move forward. Its final drive ratio has also been lowered in the name of improved acceleration, Subaru says.\n\nThere are also updates to the suspension, including a thicker rear stabilizer bar, updated coil springs, updated shock absorbers and added reinforcement to several points on the chassis, for more rigidity. Subaru also says the BRZ’s stability control thresholds have been raised while in Track mode to allow for more dynamic driving.\n\nComing in the winter of 2017 is a Performance Package for manual Limited models that adds Brembo brake calipers and larger rotors; Sachs shock absorbers; and 17-inch, black aluminum-alloy wheels.\n\nThe 86 (then called the FR-S) used to be the unrulier of these coupe twins, with a stiffer suspension and a propensity to rotate its back end around at a moment’s notice. The BRZ was the more pliant and comfortable one — a better daily driver. Now, though, after driving the BRZ and 86 within a few weeks of each other, it’s clear the new 86 has been tamed in its retuning, while the BRZ has gone the other direction. It’s now the sharper instrument.\n\nThis year’s changes are the first big updates to the BRZ’s underpinnings since its debut, and they’ve given the new BRZ a noticeable edge. It feels both sharper and more planted, with quicker turn-in and even better balance. Even though it still has those skinny tires, the suspension and chassis updates make it feel like it has more grip. The six-speed manual that came in my test vehicle was still a delight, with tight throws and a well-weighted clutch pedal.\n\nThe Subaru BRZ does, however, still have an Achilles heel: that engine. Everything surrounding it has improved so much that it’s highlighted the fact that there isn’t enough power (especially torque) for the more spirited driving the car wants to push you toward. Its shorter final ratio doesn’t change the fact that when you accelerate you still want more — and it feels like the car could handle more with no problem.\n\nI drove the BRZ on surface streets, in canyons and around the big track at Willow Springs. It was consistently excellent half the time; if all hills pointed down, the BRZ would be nearly perfect. But what goes down…\n\nEPA fuel economy ratings are 21/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual and 24/33/27 mpg with the automatic. Premium fuel is required.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the changes are subtler. There’s a new leather-wrapped steering wheel with updated controls in both trim levels, but other than that, things are much the same inside. Visibility isn’t great over either shoulder, the rear side windows are small and the large C-pillar creates a sizeable blind spot on either side. It’s also a bit noisier than, say, a commuter car, partly as a function of its firm ride but also because there’s less sound deadening to keep its weight down.\n\nThough the Subaru BRZ continues to be listed as a four-seat automobile, it is in most circumstances a two-seater. I can barely climb in the backseat, let alone fit there behind anyone who needs the seat moved back at all.\n\nPremium models have a standard cloth trim while Limited models get Alcantara (faux suede) and leather-trimmed seats that have a very nice feel to them. The seats have plenty of bolstering for more vigorous driving. Limited models add dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nOverall, though, the interior design trends spartan; this is a car focused on driving, and its interior reflects that.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThere’s not much available in the way of electronics; both BRZ trim levels feature a 6.2-inch touchscreen with Subaru’s Starlink multimedia system. Smartphone integration is minimal; there’s no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay available, but there is internet radio (Pandora or Stitcher) and a few other apps. The navigation system option was dropped last year, so if you want navigation, I’d suggest buying a smartphone mount.\n\nLimited models add a 4.2-inch LCD next to the tachometer in the instrument panel that can be customized to show different performance-related gauges, including lateral g-force, steering angle, a stopwatch for recording lap times and even a chart that shows engine power and torque curves.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nRear cargo space is small, at 6.9 cubic feet. At best, a few small bags or a set of golf clubs can fit back there. The backseat folds in a single piece to open up more room. There isn’t much cabin storage space, either; the shifter and handbrake take up most of the area between the seats, and the glove box is small.\n\nSafety\n\nThe BRZ received a score of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in each of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, except the small overlap front test, where it’s rated acceptable.\n\nThe Subaru BRZ is sparse when it comes to safety features. A backup camera is standard, but there are no advanced safety features to speak of. Forward collision warning and blind spot warning are nowhere to be found.\n\nThough the backseat is very small, there are two sets of lower Latch anchors and two top tethers, as well — but good luck fitting a child-safety seat (let alone a child) through that door opening.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThere aren’t many competitors to consider, but against the few there are, the Subaru BRZ is competitively priced. The BRZ Premium starts at $26,315 (including destination charge), and jumping to the Limited bumps the price up to $28,465. This falls in line with the 86 (which starts at $27,120), MX-5 Miata ($25,750) and 124 Spider ($25,990).\n\nThe updated 2017 Subaru BRZ is unquestionably improved; it’s sharper looking, drives better at the limit and represents one of the best values for a rear-wheel-drive performance car to be found. When it was time to hand the keys back over, I was sad to see it go. But all of these improvements just make it scream out for an engine that can keep up with the rest of the package.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Despite a distinct lack of forced induction, the new 2024 Subaru BRZ tS proves the second generation of Subaru’s and Toyota’s collaboration remains one of the greatest affordable sports cars of the past decade.\n\nVersus the competition: Regretfully, there isn’t much competition to be found in the affordable-sports-car class, but most shoppers cross-shop the BRZ’s platform mate, the Toyota GR86, as well as the Mazda MX-5 Miata. Choosing between the Subaru and the mechanically identical Toyota is a matter of preference, but the Miata is for those seeking a droptop over a coupe.\n\nAll right, I’ve had enough. \n\nNew rule: If you’ve yet to drive the second generation of either the Subaru BRZ or Toyota GR86, you’re not allowed to scream for a “turbo!” \n\n“It just needs a turbo, man. That’s all. Then it’s perfect. A turbo wou—”\n\nStop. Unless you’ve tossed a second-gen Toyobaru down your favorite road, you’re not allowed to play armchair racer here. Sorry! Chances are, if you had driven one, you’d know after one redline merge that 228 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque is just fine for this application. Now, the first-gen car? Forget it — that one hustled with as much urgency as the Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nRelated: 2024 Subaru BRZ: Performance tS Trim Returns, Starts at $31,315\n\n2024 Subaru BRZ tS | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThe second gen, however, has an extra 23 hp and 30-ish extra torques that are merely window dressing for the real changes implemented behind the block. The (admittedly lighter) 181-hp Mazda Miata suggests the previous BRZ’s 205 hp should have been enough for some cheeky activities, but that 2.0-liter flat-four lump flat-lined on fun; it just wasn’t happy performing in any scenario. It wasn’t so much the power as it was the delivery; acceptable low-end grunt disappeared almost immediately through the mid-range, then emerged again right at the top of the tach — just in time to grab another gear.\n\nLovely Linearity\n\nExtra power is great, but you know what’s better? Linear power delivery. Since its 2022 redesign, the BRZ’s torque now peaks at 3,700 rpm compared with the last gen’s 6,400 rpm, filling the gap neatly as horsepower swells to its still-high 7,000-rpm peak. In practice, this means you can merge at supra-legal speeds and genuinely (somewhat) power-out of corners — both of which complement the BRZ’s exceptional chassis better than any wine pairing. That being the case, those looking for a light, revvy, rear-wheel-drive sports car with an available manual transmission and a factory warranty have no excuse now — especially because Subaru’s already gone to the trouble of upgrading the suspension, brakes and tires for you.\n\ntSk, tSk, tSk\n\nYou’ll enjoy it if you’re able to get your mitts on the new tS edition, which in Subaru parlance translates to “Tuned by STI.” While the automaker’s erstwhile performance brand is closely associated with big ol’ turbochargers, the BRZ’s 2.4-liter flat-four engine is left entirely untouched, with the aforementioned triumvirate of dynamic focal points being the tS’ only mechanical differences over an entry-level BRZ Premium.\n\nThe tS is based on the mid-level Limited trim, and both models get gummy Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires, which deliver more stick than slide. The four-piston front and two-piston rear Brembos are new, as are the STI-tuned Hitachi shocks, all backed by a subtle set of “tS” badges on the grille and trunk lid.\n\nI’d have to compare the tS back to back with a Michelin-fitted Limited to get a full sense of the upgrades, but I will say the Brembo binders are incredibly well suited for this application, with reassuringly firm pedal feel and impressive stopping power and fade resistance.\n\nA Sorely Missed Segment\n\nThis buzziest BRZ has to be one of the best motoring experiences accessible for less than $40,000, especially if the road is right. There’s so much joy when you’re flying in a small, taut sports car, perhaps driven entirely by choking nostalgia for when we had more choices in the two-door, RWD arena. Even then, I highly doubt you could have come up with a car of similar stature, price and packaging that felt this holistically well developed.\n\nI haven’t been to my favorite road in California in some time. Certain roads — or regions — of the best SoCal tarmac serve different purposes and benefit distinctly different types and classes of performance cars. Smaller fare, like Boxsters, hot hatches and Miatas, are best launched into Malibu canyons, where tight, technical corners and narrow lanes make big boys like Vipers, Vettes and Vanquishes feel like vans. Bring the powder kegs to Angeles Crest Highway, where fast, predictable sweepers bleed into long straights for maximum attack and naughty speedo readouts.\n\n2024 Subaru BRZ tS | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nThirty-odd miles to the east of Angeles Crest, Glendora Mountain Highway slithers through the same San Gabriel Mountains and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest roads in the world. Fast and at times treacherous, it’s an impeccable blend of Malibu’s technicality and Angeles Crest’s wide-open speed. This is where Mustang meets M2; it’s a workout, but it’s a perfect performance laboratory, and a venue on which I hoped to flog the tS.\n\nRoad Rumble\n\nI arrived at the base of Glendora Mountain Highway to find it closed up tight by CalTrans, presumably due to a wildfire. With sunlight dwindling and the BRZ’s return looming in the morning, Angeles Crest was my only recourse, as I’d arrive in Malibu more than an hour after sunset. \n\nI squawked quite a bit about how much better the torque curve is on the new Toyobaru twins, but stretches of Angeles Crest Highway fall just short of 8,000 feet in elevation — enough to lobotomize the free-breathin’ BRZ beyond its generational roots. I rumbled through Angeles Crest’s base turns stymied by sluggish traffic, apprehensive at the wheezy climb ahead.\n\nWhat a worrywart. Though it’s hardly a Hellcat, the BRZ sliced through the road’s various segments, carrying impressive momentum and poise, balanced by the Michelins’ gluey grip. Alongside the Miata, this is driving elementalism at its finest: sub-3,000-pound weight, notchy six-speed manual transmission, buzzy four-cylinder. Compared with the legions of 5,000-pound electric crossovers that cycle through my rotating press fleet, the BRZ’s reactive inputs are unbelievable — a sore reminder that the zappy side of things has yet to offer even a remote replacement.\n\n2024 Subaru BRZ tS | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Subaru BRZ Gets Standard Sport Mode for Manuals, Priced From $32,265\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2025 Subaru WRX tS Review: Top of the Food Chain\nResearch the Subaru BRZ\nShop for a 2024 Subaru BRZ\nDying Breed\n\nEven with the engine gasping for air, keeping the revs a thousand or two from redline kept straight-line pace high and challenged my bravery for over-crest acceleration into corners that dove and twisted away from a sustained grade. Scared? Lean on those stiff Brembos to soak up that speed, and don’t be alarmed if the rear slips — you’ll catch it like a pop-fly. \n\nWhat a special experience. Not for materials or performance, but for the genuine novelty of driving an affordable sports car in an age when the species of Crossovera SUVicus reigns supreme. Get the 2024 Subaru BRZ tS while stock lasts, or maybe just add some Brembos to your Limited — you’ll be more than halfway there.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 about the 2015 Subaru BRZ. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Subaru BRZ is one of the purest performance cars you can buy, with an intoxicating formula of perfect weight balance, precise steering and responsive throttle, all experienced in a sporty cockpit. Plus, it’s a relative bargain.\n\nFor 2015, the BRZ has revised shock absorbers for improved handling, according to Subaru, as well as larger tailpipes. There’s a new limited-edition Series.Blue version, of which only 1,000 will be sold in the U.S. This is the version we tested. Compare the 2014 and 2015 versions here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThis small package has sporty lines and an aggressive stance, but it’s really the shapely front that speaks to us. While cars of every stripe are getting larger, taller, more vertical grilles and front ends, the BRZ is sticking to a traditionally low-slung front bumper.\n\nThe rather traditional sports-car looks are disturbed only by a small inset behind the front wheels, where a functional air inlet might be (but isn’t). We’re unsure why this is needed visually, because there’s no practical reason for it to be there.\n\nSeries.Blue models come in only two exterior colors, blue or white, and include 17-inch black wheels, red brake calipers, an aerodynamic body kit and a rear spoiler. It looks good in the white we tested for this review; it was frequently ogled on the street.\n\nHow It Drives\nMost car enthusiasts and sports-car shoppers focus on power first, everything else second. If you look at power numbers, though, the BRZ seems downright miserable. A V-6 Ford Mustang seems more appealing, given it has 100 more horsepower.\n\nBut here’s the thing: You really don’t need more power in a car that handles as superbly as the BRZ. I spent considerable time in the BRZ as a long-term test car in 2013, as well as with the 2015 Series.Blue, and there’s only one time I thought it ever felt underpowered — and that was on the straightaway of one of the fastest racetracks in the country, Road America in Wisconsin.\n\nIn every other instance, including smaller road courses, the BRZ has plenty of power. When equipped with the manual transmission — we don’t recommend the automatic — acceleration is immediate and delivered with a throaty induction note to boot.\n\nThe power really isn’t the thing that makes everyone fall in love with the BRZ, anyway. It’s the handling. Oh, the handling.\n\nWant to feel connected to a machine when taking a highway off-ramp — let alone a racetrack? Then you want a BRZ. Its precision and sharp turning really put the car in a class of its own, with the lightweight frame and rear-wheel drive adding up to what at times feels like an amusement-park ride.\n\nInterior\nThat feeling of “pure” performance is enhanced by the car’s stripped-down — yet driver-oriented — cockpit. There aren’t many, if any, frills in the BRZ. The sport seats hold you snugly and the gauges are simply laid out, with a large tachometer and digital speedometer meant for the business of driving.\n\nThe car’s materials aren’t stellar, but they align with the quality you’d expect in a car at this price. The Series.Blue treatment added blue leather seat bolsters and accent stitching to our test car. Subaru’s other performance halos, the WRX and WRX STI, basically have compact car interiors, and this is a step above those at a lesser price.\n\nWhile the driver feels snug and secure, though — becoming “one with the car” — passengers will likely long to leave the tight confines. Rear passengers will barely be able to fit at all, depending on their height, and will have to contort feet, legs and necks in most instances.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe driver may be the most important person in the car, but that doesn’t mean that person is going to be pampered. The BRZ’s bare-bones, driver-focused design has sore points. For example, a driver often wants a center armrest, especially on long drives, and the BRZ does not have one.\n\nThen there’s the awful multimedia system interface that has not been improved since the car’s introduction. With the lack of audio controls on the steering wheel — it’s a pure driver’s car, remember — drivers are left to stab at the small touch-screen to do things as simple as skip an audio track. It’s impossible to do so without taking your eyes off the road, which a skilled driver would not want to do. Tip: Don’t play music on shuffle in the BRZ.\n\nThe multimedia system itself is far behind almost anything on the market these days in terms of both user interface and graphics quality. That’s too bad, as Subaru has finally upgraded its technology in its other vehicles. The BRZ’s platform, which is shared with Toyota, seems to be the only one that won’t get the benefit of that improvement.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe small storage area in the center console between the passenger and driver is barely large enough for a smartphone and change. Want to take the wallet out of your back pocket to get more comfortable in the firm seats? Good luck finding a place for it that doesn’t leave it to fly around the cabin during those sharp turns you’ll be hunting out.\n\nThe trunk, however, is quite decent, even though the 6.9 cubic-foot measurement is small. There’s plenty of room for luggage and even golf clubs, and the rear seats fold down for added space. We fit a set of four winter tires in our long-term BRZ with the rear seats folded down.\n\nSafety\nThe BRZ is a Top Safety Pick at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, scoring top grades of good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable or good) in all tests except the small overlap front test, where it scored acceptable. It also has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThese results should add an extra sense of confidence, because sports cars are seldom crash-tested at all.\n\nYou can find the BRZ’s standard safety equipment listed here.\n\nThe Scion FR-S — a basic twin to the BRZ — is one of the few cars to fail our Car Seat Check because of the extreme bolstering in the backseat and narrow width of the seat bottoms. These results apply to the BRZ as well.\n\nValue in Its Class\nStarting at just over $26,000 including destination and with the preferred manual transmission, the BRZ is a relative steal in terms of fun-to-dollar ratio. But buyers must be prepared for traditional sports-car trade-offs when shopping for one. There are similarly priced cars, like the Volkswagen GTI. That car is fun to drive, has a lot more passenger and cargo room, and it’s faster.\n\nBut it’s almost impossible to find anything that can replicate the BRZ’s symbiotic relationship with its driver at any price.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Like its twin, the Scion FR-S, the 2013 Subaru BRZ is a welcome return to an era of fun, light, simple sports cars that are affordable, too.\n\nJapanese automakers Subaru and Toyota have been linked for years. Toyota owns a substantial stake in the smaller company, whose Indiana assembly plant manufactures Camrys. So it wasn’t a surprise when the two companies announced a joint venture to produce a car … .\n\nOh, who am I kidding? It was a surprise: Toyota determined it needed a sportier car than it has marketed in about a decade, so it handed most of the engineering responsibility for a rear-wheel-drive car to a manufacturer that has exclusively sold all-wheel-drive models in the U.S. Wha?\n\nBut the cars are here now, the Toyota version being sold as the 2013 Scion FR-S, which we’ve reviewed separately, and the Subaru on sale as the 2013 BRZ. (See them side by side.)\n\nAs far as the driving experience is concerned, these models are essentially the same car. In fact, I wouldn’t debate anyone who calls them identical. Some will claim to detect small differences in their dynamics, but the only consequential differentiators are features and cabin materials. If differences among normal competing models are measured with a yardstick, these two require a micrometer.\n\nYou actually need a yardstick to compare other competitors, because nothing in this price range is quite the size of the BRZ. The Nissan 370Z is similarly sized, but that one starts at $33,900, while the BRZ is base-priced at $26,265 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe exterior design is unmistakably Japanese and definitely eye-catching to an unfamiliar public. Here, too, the styling differences between the BRZ and FR-S are few. Along with their overall exterior shape, the headlights and taillights — defining elements — are the same shape. The Scion has a more serious face, where the BRZ turns the grille’s frown upside down.\n\nSubaru provided the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine — the same horizontally opposed design that powers every Subaru model and no other Toyota- or Scion-brand vehicle — yet Scion got the nifty fender badge depicting horizontally opposed pistons. How did that happen? The badge also bears the number 86, as the Toyota-branded model sold overseas retained the GT 86 nameplate of its concept car (itself an homage to a generation of the rear-wheel-drive Celica sold in the 1980s). The BRZ has a faux vent on the fender instead.\n\nAdequate Power\nWith 200 horsepower, the BRZ is reasonably quick, weighing just 2,762 pounds. The torque peak is a modest 151 pounds-feet that comes at 6,400 rpm — much closer to the 7,500 rpm redline than to idle. Toyota’s main contribution is a novel fuel system with two injectors per cylinder — one in each intake port and one direct — that enables a high compression ratio of 12.5 to 1 on premium gas.\n\nThe low-rev torque is adequate, but the BRZ doesn’t start to feel like a sports car until it’s wound out — especially with the automatic transmission, which has a lazy launch. At higher revs, the engine sounded louder and coarser that most of our editors cared for. On the flip side, there’s something more satisfying about the flat-four exhaust note than a common inline-four engine.\n\nMany automotive enthusiasts deemed the BRZ underpowered before it even hit the market. I’d call that a stretch, and anyone who wants more power need only wait awhile; it’s coming.\n\nAs all sports cars should, the BRZ has a six-speed manual transmission — standard — and it’s a good one: The throws are short and the gates well-defined. If the mere fact that it’s a manual, plus its excellent execution, aren’t reasons enough to like it, how about faster sprints? Our friends at MotorWeek clocked the manual’s zero-to-60 time at 6.2 seconds and the automatic’s at 7.7 seconds.\n\nThe optional six-speed automatic ($1,100) has Drive and Sport modes, as well as a Snow mode that’s the opposite of Sport — limited torque and upshifts occurring as soon as possible as you add speed. You can also shift manually via the gear-selector lever or paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nIt’s a decent automatic that occasionally exhibits some hesitation. On downshifts, it rev-matches expertly, if not too quickly. Honestly, despite its slower sprints, I’m fine with the choice of a conventional transmission design over a dual-clutch automated manual. In affordable cars, the latter type shifts quickly but often disappoints in other ways. If you want fast and fun (and not to be a weenie), get the manual.\n\nThe EPA mileage estimates are respectable at 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined for the manual and 25/34/28 mpg for the automatic. Premium gas is required.\n\nHandling\nIf you expect to drive on a track, you want the manual. I took an automatic BRZ out on Road America’s four-mile road course and found the gear ratios weren’t right. In fairness, this track is too fast for the BRZ — but that’s why its excellent dynamics won me over.\n\nFormulas don’t always translate to reality, but in the BRZ’s case, light weight, rear-wheel drive and simplicity definitely translate to the engaging experience you expect. In some cars, rear wheels driven with modest torque can stay in line like a boot-camp recruit. The BRZ happily swings its tail about and snaps it back with a flick of the steering wheel or a deft throttle adjustment. The steering is quick, with prompt turn-in and a nicely weighted wheel.\n\nIf the BRZ reminds me of any car, it’s the Mazda MX-5 Miata, one of which I own. Though it’s a two-seater and a convertible, the Mazda shares the formula and the results: rear-drive layout, excellent balance, communicative steering and controllability. Perhaps that’s the BRZ’s greatest attribute: controllability. A car might come with outstanding control all its own, but that can be boring. Unflappably poised: bad. Uncontrollable: bad. Loose but controllable: good.\n\nThe BRZ’s tires play a part in its fun factor. While they’re respectable, the stock Michelin Primacy HP summer tires (rated P215/45R17) are marketed for “Luxury Performance Touring.” The word “touring” always suggests less of a performance emphasis. Wider or grippier rubber would certainly let the BRZ take corners faster, but I still like the package as-is.\n\nRide & Comfort\nThe BRZ’s ride quality definitely says sport. It’s not objectionable for this vehicle type, but it doesn’t have the dual sport/comfort personality some modern cars deliver. The firm seats play a part, as they don’t absorb shocks themselves. All our editors liked the seats, though: They hold you in place for spirited driving — without being overly restrictive or difficult to get into. The adjustable head restraint is another bonus, because sometimes sport seats have a one-piece backrest. The lack of a center armrest irritated a few of us, though.\n\nThe cabin is where you’ll find most of the differences between the BRZ and FR-S. Most of our editors preferred the BRZ, mainly because it replaces the FR-S’ large, aftermarket-style radio with a touch-screen navigation system. Though the FR-S costs $24,955, the additional $1,310 for the BRZ’s base Premium trim level isn’t bad for the navigation system and xenon headlights. Scion includes free maintenance for two years (details), but Subaru offers one more year of roadside assistance: three years or 36,000 miles versus two years or 25,000 miles.\n\nNotable options include an auto-dimming rearview mirror and HomeLink.\n\nUnlike the Scion, the Subaru comes in two trim levels. For $2,000 more, the BRZ Limited adds more features: keyless access, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and side mirrors, fog lights and a wing spoiler.\n\nNeither these extra features nor the ones that distinguish the base BRZ Premium from the FR-S are available on the Scion, even as options.\n\n‘Backseat’\nKnown as a 2+2, the BRZ has two small rear seats that are best left to children. While the headroom is better than I expected, I had practically no legroom. But it’s good to have the space for storage. The seatbacks fold forward to extend the trunk room, allowing space for four tires on track day, according to Subaru.\n\nAt 6.9 cubic feet, the trunk itself is 1.6 cubic feet larger than the Miata’s, but the Miata’s lack of a backseat means the trunk is all you get. The larger Ford Mustang has 13.4 cubic feet of trunk space and a larger backseat. (See the cars compared side by side.)\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety deemed the BRZ a Top Safety Pick, reflecting top scores in all tests — impressive for a sports car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hadn’t tested the BRZ as of publication.\n\nThe BRZ has two front airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact torso airbags and side curtains for the front and rear seats. As is required of all new cars since the 2012 model year, the BRZ has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. See all the safety features listed here.\n\nBRZ in the Market\nWhen a sporty car is this good upon its debut, you know it immediately. It has all the elements that, if missing, couldn’t be fixed easily or cheaply. (Cars don’t magically lose weight or get revised steering or new suspensions or weight distribution without an overhaul.) Simply put, the BRZ can only get better from here, with more power, brake and tire upgrades … you name it.\n\nUnfamiliar with the beastly WRX STI, most Americans don’t recognize that Subaru has the performance chops to build a BRZ. If anything, the excellence resulting from this joint venture exposes both how far Toyota has fallen and the ways in which a supposedly evolving automotive industry has actually devolved. These two fun, affordable sports cars are exceptions. They shouldn’t be.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2012 about the 2013 Subaru BRZ. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLike its twin, the Scion FR-S, the 2013 Subaru BRZ is a welcome return to an era of fun, light, simple sports cars that are affordable, too.\n\nJapanese automakers Subaru and Toyota have been linked for years. Toyota owns a substantial stake in the smaller company, whose Indiana assembly plant manufactures Camrys. So it wasn’t a surprise when the two companies announced a joint venture to produce a car … .\n\nOh, who am I kidding? It was a surprise: Toyota determined it needed a sportier car than it has marketed in about a decade, so it handed most of the engineering responsibility for a rear-wheel-drive car to a manufacturer that has exclusively sold all-wheel-drive models in the U.S. Wha?\n\nBut the cars are here now, the Toyota version being sold as the 2013 Scion FR-S, which we’ve reviewed separately, and the Subaru on sale as the 2013 BRZ. (See them side by side.)\n\nAs far as the driving experience is concerned, these models are essentially the same car. In fact, I wouldn’t debate anyone who calls them identical. Some will claim to detect small differences in their dynamics, but the only consequential differentiators are features and cabin materials. If differences among normal competing models are measured with a yardstick, these two require a micrometer.\n\nYou actually need a yardstick to compare other competitors, because nothing in this price range is quite the size of the BRZ. The Nissan 370Z is similarly sized, but that one starts at $33,900, while the BRZ is base-priced at $26,265 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe exterior design is unmistakably Japanese and definitely eye-catching to an unfamiliar public. Here, too, the styling differences between the BRZ and FR-S are few. Along with their overall exterior shape, the headlights and taillights — defining elements — are the same shape. The Scion has a more serious face, where the BRZ turns the grille’s frown upside down.\n\nSubaru provided the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine — the same horizontally opposed design that powers every Subaru model and no other Toyota- or Scion-brand vehicle — yet Scion got the nifty fender badge depicting horizontally opposed pistons. How did that happen? The badge also bears the number 86, as the Toyota-branded model sold overseas retained the GT 86 nameplate of its concept car (itself an homage to a generation of the rear-wheel-drive Celica sold in the 1980s). The BRZ has a faux vent on the fender instead.\n\nAdequate Power\nWith 200 horsepower, the BRZ is reasonably quick, weighing just 2,762 pounds. The torque peak is a modest 151 pounds-feet that comes at 6,400 rpm — much closer to the 7,500 rpm redline than to idle. Toyota’s main contribution is a novel fuel system with two injectors per cylinder — one in each intake port and one direct — that enables a high compression ratio of 12.5 to 1 on premium gas.\n\nThe low-rev torque is adequate, but the BRZ doesn’t start to feel like a sports car until it’s wound out — especially with the automatic transmission, which has a lazy launch. At higher revs, the engine sounded louder and coarser that most of our editors cared for. On the flip side, there’s something more satisfying about the flat-four exhaust note than a common inline-four engine.\n\nMany automotive enthusiasts deemed the BRZ underpowered before it even hit the market. I’d call that a stretch, and anyone who wants more power need only wait awhile; it’s coming.\n\nAs all sports cars should, the BRZ has a six-speed manual transmission — standard — and it’s a good one: The throws are short and the gates well-defined. If the mere fact that it’s a manual, plus its excellent execution, aren’t reasons enough to like it, how about faster sprints? Our friends at MotorWeek clocked the manual’s zero-to-60 time at 6.2 seconds and the automatic’s at 7.7 seconds.\n\nThe optional six-speed automatic ($1,100) has Drive and Sport modes, as well as a Snow mode that’s the opposite of Sport — limited torque and upshifts occurring as soon as possible as you add speed. You can also shift manually via the gear-selector lever or paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nIt’s a decent automatic that occasionally exhibits some hesitation. On downshifts, it rev-matches expertly, if not too quickly. Honestly, despite its slower sprints, I’m fine with the choice of a conventional transmission design over a dual-clutch automated manual. In affordable cars, the latter type shifts quickly but often disappoints in other ways. If you want fast and fun (and not to be a weenie), get the manual.\n\nThe EPA mileage estimates are respectable at 22/30/25 mpg city/highway/combined for the manual and 25/34/28 mpg for the automatic. Premium gas is required.\n\nHandling\nIf you expect to drive on a track, you want the manual. I took an automatic BRZ out on Road America’s four-mile road course and found the gear ratios weren’t right. In fairness, this track is too fast for the BRZ — but that’s why its excellent dynamics won me over.\n\nFormulas don’t always translate to reality, but in the BRZ’s case, light weight, rear-wheel drive and simplicity definitely translate to the engaging experience you expect. In some cars, rear wheels driven with modest torque can stay in line like a boot-camp recruit. The BRZ happily swings its tail about and snaps it back with a flick of the steering wheel or a deft throttle adjustment. The steering is quick, with prompt turn-in and a nicely weighted wheel.\n\nIf the BRZ reminds me of any car, it’s the Mazda MX-5 Miata, one of which I own. Though it’s a two-seater and a convertible, the Mazda shares the formula and the results: rear-drive layout, excellent balance, communicative steering and controllability. Perhaps that’s the BRZ’s greatest attribute: controllability. A car might come with outstanding control all its own, but that can be boring. Unflappably poised: bad. Uncontrollable: bad. Loose but controllable: good.\n\nThe BRZ’s tires play a part in its fun factor. While they’re respectable, the stock Michelin Primacy HP summer tires (rated P215/45R17) are marketed for “Luxury Performance Touring.” The word “touring” always suggests less of a performance emphasis. Wider or grippier rubber would certainly let the BRZ take corners faster, but I still like the package as-is.\n\nRide & Comfort\nThe BRZ’s ride quality definitely says sport. It’s not objectionable for this vehicle type, but it doesn’t have the dual sport/comfort personality some modern cars deliver. The firm seats play a part, as they don’t absorb shocks themselves. All our editors liked the seats, though: They hold you in place for spirited driving — without being overly restrictive or difficult to get into. The adjustable head restraint is another bonus, because sometimes sport seats have a one-piece backrest. The lack of a center armrest irritated a few of us, though.\n\nThe cabin is where you’ll find most of the differences between the BRZ and FR-S. Most of our editors preferred the BRZ, mainly because it replaces the FR-S’ large, aftermarket-style radio with a touch-screen navigation system. Though the FR-S costs $24,955, the additional $1,310 for the BRZ’s base Premium trim level isn’t bad for the navigation system and xenon headlights. Scion includes free maintenance for two years (details), but Subaru offers one more year of roadside assistance: three years or 36,000 miles versus two years or 25,000 miles.\n\nNotable options include an auto-dimming rearview mirror and HomeLink.\n\nUnlike the Scion, the Subaru comes in two trim levels. For $2,000 more, the BRZ Limited adds more features: keyless access, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and side mirrors, fog lights and a wing spoiler.\n\nNeither these extra features nor the ones that distinguish the base BRZ Premium from the FR-S are available on the Scion, even as options.\n\n‘Backseat’\nKnown as a 2+2, the BRZ has two small rear seats that are best left to children. While the headroom is better than I expected, I had practically no legroom. But it’s good to have the space for storage. The seatbacks fold forward to extend the trunk room, allowing space for four tires on track day, according to Subaru.\n\nAt 6.9 cubic feet, the trunk itself is 1.6 cubic feet larger than the Miata’s, but the Miata’s lack of a backseat means the trunk is all you get. The larger Ford Mustang has 13.4 cubic feet of trunk space and a larger backseat. (See the cars compared side by side.)\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety deemed the BRZ a Top Safety Pick, reflecting top scores in all tests — impressive for a sports car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hadn’t tested the BRZ as of publication.\n\nThe BRZ has two front airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact torso airbags and side curtains for the front and rear seats. As is required of all new cars since the 2012 model year, the BRZ has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. See all the safety features listed here.\n\nBRZ in the Market\nWhen a sporty car is this good upon its debut, you know it immediately. It has all the elements that, if missing, couldn’t be fixed easily or cheaply. (Cars don’t magically lose weight or get revised steering or new suspensions or weight distribution without an overhaul.) Simply put, the BRZ can only get better from here, with more power, brake and tire upgrades … you name it.\n\nUnfamiliar with the beastly WRX STI, most Americans don’t recognize that Subaru has the performance chops to build a BRZ. If anything, the excellence resulting from this joint venture exposes both how far Toyota has fallen and the ways in which a supposedly evolving automotive industry has actually devolved. These two fun, affordable sports cars are exceptions. They shouldn’t be.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Looks like: The BRZ wears new styling that Subaru says is aggressive but functionally aerodynamic \n\nCompetes with: Fiat 124 Spider, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Toyota 86, Volkswagen Golf GTI\n\nPowertrain: 228-horsepower, 2.4-liter boxer four-cylinder engine; six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Early fall 2021\n\nWe have a soft spot for Subaru’s BRZ sports coupe — the car jointly took home our Best of 2013 award — and now it looks like we’ll have a few more reasons to like it. Subaru today revealed a redesigned 2022 BRZ with additional power, aggressive styling and a more modern cabin. (Toyota has a related car in the 86, formerly the Scion FR-S, built under a joint venture with Subaru, with a redesign on that side rumored soon.)\n\nRelated: Toyota 86 Vs. Toyota Supra 2.0: How Do Toyota’s 4-Cylinder Sports Cars Compare?\n\nExterior\n\nSubaru says the new BRZ sports a modern design that’s focused on aerodynamic functionality. The coupe is about an inch longer and half an inch lower than the previous version. The most dramatic addition to its face are huge functional air intakes under sleeker headlights. Other design highlights include a lower grille with more-pronounced fenders, large functional side vents and a roofline with a double-bubble design, which Subaru says recalls vintage racing cars.  \n\nThe BRZ’s aggressive look continues out back with large rear fenders, dual exhaust ports and an upturned spoiler. The car will come in Premium and Limited trim levels, with the Premium riding 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and the Limited getting 18s. \n\nInterior\n\nThe BRZ again has a small, two-position rear seat. New this year is a customizable 7-inch digital gauge cluster with the tachometer and digital speedometer readout, which sits ahead of the driver. There’s also a programmable meter that can show amps, water temperature or a G-force meter.\n\nFront and center on the dash is an 8-inch version of Subau’s Starlink touchscreen, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. \n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nThe big news under the hood is more power. The 2022 BRZ uses a new, naturally aspirated 2.4-liter boxer four-cylinder engine good for 228 horsepower, up from the 2020’s 2.0-liter that made 205 hp in tS trim. Subaru says the engine redlines at 7,000 rpm and sees a 15% increase in torque compared with the previous engine. A six-speed manual transmission is again standard; a six-speed automatic with a new Sport mode is available. Sport mode optimizes the BRZ for more aggressive driving by allowing for more rapid downshifts with automatic throttle-blipping. Subaru says the system also uses yaw sensors to hold a lower gear during hard cornering.\n\nThe BRZ again rides a rear-wheel-drive platform — which has been strengthened for 2022 — and Subaru says the front suspension wears custom-designed MacPherson-type struts that should improve handling and ride quality. The horizontally opposed engine’s lower placement in the chassis gives the coupe a lower center of gravity than the outgoing BRZ, which should also improve handling over what was already a dynamic car.  \n\nThe coupe’s vehicle stability control system has also been updated with track driving in mind. The automaker says it now allows for more input from the driver before it activates; it can also be fully deactivated. \n\nSafety\n\nSubaru has not yet released a full list of standard and available features, but it said vehicles equipped with the six-speed automatic transmission get the automaker’s EyeSight driver-assist technology. \n\nThe 2022 BRZ will go on sale early in the fall of 2021. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Toyota Supra Review: More, and Less, Power Make Up Sophomore Changes\nResearch the Subaru BRZ\nResearch Sports Cars\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe 2020 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe that seats up to four people. It’s powered by a 205-horsepower, horizontally opposed 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Competitors include the Mazda MX-5 Miata, Fiat 124 Spider and Volkswagen Golf GTI. The BRZ is related to the Toyota 86.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe tS trim level returns for 2020 featuring STI-tuned Sachs shocks and springs, an engine compartment brace, Brembo-brand brakes, a low-profile rear spoiler, special badges, and a leather-and-Alcantara interior with contrast red stitching. It’s finished exclusively in Ceramic White paint and wears 18-inch matte-bronze wheels fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Production is limited to 300 units.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Subaru BRZ Are Most Important?\n\nThe BRZ’s relatively light curb weight and low center of gravity help give it exceptional handling. It’s also affordable — as sports cars go — with a base price of less than $30,000 including destination.\n\nPerformance attributes include a Torsen limited-slip differential, summer tires and a double-wishbone rear suspension. The available Performance Package adds Brembo-brand brakes, Sachs shock absorbers and dark gray 17-inch alloy wheels. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are standard. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe BRZ has all the elements of a driver’s car, including great handling, communicative steering and a slick-shifting manual transmission. It’s a joy to fling the BRZ around. The car’s modest power output has been a sore spot for some, but if you’re willing to keep engine rpm up, the BRZ can be a lot of fun in everyday driving. Steer clear of the automatic transmission, however, because it can be slow off the line.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe 2019 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe that seats up to four people. It’s powered by a 205-horsepower, horizontally opposed 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Competitors include the Mazda MX-5 Miata, Fiat 124 Spider and Volkswagen Golf GTI. The BRZ is related to the Toyota 86.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Subaru BRZ?\n\nA limited-edition Series.Gray model is available. Based on the Limited trim level with the Performance Package, the Series.Gray features gray paint, black 17-inch alloy wheels, black badges and black mirror caps; Subaru says it will build 250 Series.Gray versions. Meanwhile, the Limited trim's built-in navigation system now supports over-the-air updates.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Subaru BRZ Are Most Important?\n\nThe BRZ's relatively light curb weight and low center of gravity help give it exceptional handling. It's also affordable, as sports cars go, with a base price of less than $27,000 including destination. Performance attributes include a Torsen limited-slip differential, summer tires and a double-wishbone rear suspension. The available Performance Package adds Brembo-brand brakes, Sachs shock absorbers and dark-gray 17-inch alloy wheels. Limited models add Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe BRZ has all the elements of a driver's car, including great handling, communicative steering and a slick-shifting manual transmission — it's a joy to fling the BRZ around. The car's modest power output has been a sore spot for some, but if you're willing to keep engine rpm up, the BRZ can be a lot of fun in everyday driving. Steer clear of the automatic transmission, however, because it can be slow off the line.",

      "expert_review": "For the past two model years, Subaru has offered colorized limited editions of the BRZ — the Series.Hyperblue in 2016 and the Series.Yellow in 2017. Both of those, however, were more like glorified appearance packages, offering different colors and trim pieces but not really upping the BRZ’s performance quotient.\n\nRelated: On the Edge of Glory: 6 Cars That Come This Close to Greatness\n\nThe only similarity between the 2018 BRZ tS and those cars is that they were all limited to 500 units. Otherwise, the BRZ tS comes with much more substantive changes (along with three color choices) that do indeed change the way that the car drives. In my mind, it’s the best the Subaru BRZ can get without — what fans like me have been calling on for years — a big boost in power.\n\nThe BRZ tS will cost $34,355 (including destination charges), a $5,050 premium over the Limited Subaru BRZ trim.\n\nWhat We Tested\nPowertrain: 205-horsepower, 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder “boxer” engine, 156 pounds-feet of torque; six-speed manual transmission; rear-wheel drive\nFuel economy: 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined (premium fuel required)\nKey features: Manually adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing, STI-tuned suspension with unique dampers, front and side spoilers, 18-inch lightweight wheels, Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, high-performance Brembo brakes (front and rear), Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, leather and Alcantara upholstery\nPrice: $34,355\n\nThe Subaru BRZ tS gets some added exterior flair with its manually adjustable carbon-fiber rear spoiler and underspoilers at the front, sides and rear. There’s also extensive mechanical and tuning upgrades — tS stands for “tuned by STI,” and the mad scientists of Subaru’s performance division have gone to work on the suspension and traction control, swapping in STI-tuned dampers and coil springs and adding draw stiffeners. They also went to work on the traction control, adding a track mode and dialing in more allowable slippage at the rear.\n\nWork has also been done at the wheels, too. The BRZ tS has the largest wheels offered on a BRZ (lightweight 18-inchers) wrapped in sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires. The BRZ and sibling Toyota 86 were both known for having skinnier tires without much grip, which made them feel a bit edgier and easier to make slip (especially when it’s wet). Interestingly, when the BRZ was last redesigned last year, it kind of swapped places with the Toyota 86. The original BRZ was more tame, and the 86 (then the Scion FR-S) the stiffer car with more of a propensity to break loose — but these latest versions of the car turned that convention on its head, and the BRZ is now the tighter of the two.\n\nThe changes to the BRZ tS kind of tame some of that added twitchiness out. Driving it feels somehow both familiar and new at the same time. The car’s great natural balance and handling are still present, but both feel as though they have been enhanced to another degree. Adding more tire to the car might be the most significant change; the added grip lets you corner even harder, and the rear stays more composed under acceleration, which helps the whole car feel more planted. It’s a fantastic momentum driver.\n\nBut therein lies the problem: It’s a momentum driver that has trouble building momentum. The canyon roads near Malibu, Calif., are not just picturesque, they come with an aggressive elevation change. As long as the hills were pointed in the right direction — downward — the BRZ tS was impeccable. But uphill runs are the bane of this car; try as you might to mount a charge up them, the car runs out of breath. And this STI-inspired Subaru BRZ remains frustratingly laggy from a stop.\n\nThis makes Subaru’s BRZ tS both the best example of what the BRZ can be, while also being the poster child for why the car needs to change. It builds on the its strengths without addressing its key weakness — maybe it’s only weakness.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe Subaru BRZ is a compact sports coupe with a four-cylinder boxer engine under its hood. It shares a platform with the Toyota GR86; the two cars were co-developed by Subaru and Toyota. The sole engine is a 228-horsepower, horizontally opposed 2.4-liter four-cylinder that sends power to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission. For those who don’t want to shift for themselves, a six-speed automatic is available. Small sports cars are not a thriving breed these days, so the BRZ’s pool of competitors is small; its closest rivals are the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Nissan Z.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Subaru BRZ?\n\nThe BRZ is mostly unchanged for 2025. A Sport mode that sharpens throttle response is now standard in versions with the six-speed manual transmission, and the Limited trim receives minor updates to its upholstery.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Subaru BRZ Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n7-inch digital instrument display\nTorsen limited-slip differential\n17-inch alloy wheels\nDual-zone climate control\nLED headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather and synthetic suede upholstery\nHeated front seats\n18-inch alloy wheels\nMichelin summer tires\nUpgraded audio system \nAdaptive headlights\nBlind spot warning\nRear automatic braking  \nShould I Buy the 2025 Subaru BRZ?\n\nFew cars can match the thrills the BRZ provides on a twisty road. Its outstanding agility is nicely matched by the power on tap, though more ponies under the hood wouldn’t be amiss here. Let’s also point out that the backseat is nearly unusable by humans of any size, and the trunk is about what you’d expect from a tiny sports coupe — meaning it’s small. That said, it’s a delight to drive a sports car that doesn’t make outrageous horsepower numbers its main attraction. Affordable and fairly easy on a fuel budget, the BRZ is a value-minded thrill ride.",
