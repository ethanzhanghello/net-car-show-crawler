      "expert_review": "For 2015, the Subaru Legacy has overcome the fuel economy penalty of standard all-wheel drive while delivering all-season capability in a handsome package, inside and out. It’s now one of the most affordable cars in its class.\n\nThe prototypical family sedan is a relatively simple formula. It needs a comfortable ride, acceptable power, and plenty of space for said family and their stuff. One thing most sedan shoppers have ignored is all-wheel drive, due to its drain on fuel economy minus any universally appreciated performance benefits.\n\nAs before, the Legacy comes with the choice of a four- or six-cylinder horizontally opposed engine. Both work with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The manual and conventional automatic transmissions have been discontinued.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMidsize sedan designs take one of two paths: There’s the wild road of the aggressively styled Mazda6, Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200, and there’s the safe road of the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Hyundai Sonata.\n\nThe Legacy joins the latter group with a generic look that’s as easy to lose in a grocery store parking lot as any car. No matter what angle you approach it from, there’s nothing that really screams “Subaru.” The grille looks a bit like a Ford, the side resembles an Accord and the rear could be from any of a handful of contemporary sedans.\n\nHow It Drives\nMost Legacy sedans will be sold with the 2.5-liter, four-cylinder boxer engine. These flat power plants provide a bit of an edge in handling because of a lower center of gravity. Horsepower and torque haven’t changed much versus the outgoing model — 175 hp versus 173 hp, while torque remains 174 pounds-feet — but nearly every part of the engine has been upgraded or straight-out replaced. It seems Subaru wasn’t comfortable calling it “new,” though, because the specs aren’t eye-catching.\n\nOne spec that has dramatically changed, however, is fuel efficiency. With the 2.5-liter engine, combined mileage has increased from 27 mpg to 30 mpg (it’s rated 26/36 city/highway). These are similar or better numbers than the Honda Accord (29 mpg combined) and Toyota Camry (28 mpg), while the Nissan Altima (31 mpg) and Mazda6 (32 mpg) still have an edge. However, the Legacy includes the additional weight of all-wheel drive while the rest of the class is largely front-wheel drive.\n\nFor comparison, the four-cylinder, all-wheel-drive 2015 Ford Fusion is rated 25 mpg combined, and the all-wheel-drive 2015 Chrysler 200, which comes only with a V-6, is rated 22 mpg.\n\nOn the road, it isn’t the additional 2 hp that makes a difference, it’s the upgraded continuously variable automatic transmission. The company added artificial shift points to make the CVT respond like a traditional automatic, losing the long wind-out of steady acceleration that consumers have complained about. It’s roughly two generations removed from the CVT I drive every week in my 2010 Outback, and it responds significantly better. Other editors on staff, though, still found the CVT lacking in terms of refinement and too noisy with both the 2.5-liter and the more powerful 3.6-liter six-cylinder.\n\nThe six-cylinder is offered only in the highest, Limited trim level and delivers more oomph to pass — as would be expected from the more than 75 additional horsepower. Some editors found the power welcome, while others, including myself, thought the four-cylinder was the better all-around car considering its fuel economy numbers.\n\nBoth versions feature standard all-wheel drive, and the system has been revised for 2015, offering a 60/40 rear/front torque split. Our editors agreed it delivered impressive handling. Only the tires proved to be a sore spot, giving up grip in the hardest of turns.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Chrysler 200 V-6 feels much sportier than the Legacy’s 3.6-liter. The Chrysler’s handling is also sharper and the ride considerably quieter. However, the 200’s nine-speed transmission and ride quality leave a bit to be desired.\n\nRide comfort was universally praised for both versions of the Legacy. There’s isolation from road imperfections without too much wheel travel or a floaty feeling over bumps.\n\nInterior\nOne knock against the previous Legacy was its low-rent interior, and the 2015 has been significantly upgraded, with padded materials wherever passengers come in contact with them. Most of our editors found the upgrades well worth it and on par with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, while others pointed to the fake metal trim pieces as less than stellar.\n\nThe driver and front passenger seats are well-padded and quite wide, while the backseat is exceptionally spacious. Legroom and headroom back there are slightly behind the Accord and Camry, but both rear hip room and shoulder room are slightly ahead of those two.\n\nThe relatively tall greenhouse offers plenty of glass for not only good visibility for the driver, but also a feeling of openness for passengers, which is a nice carryover from the outgoing model.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nOne of the biggest gripes we’ve had with recent Subaru vehicles involved their subpar multimedia offerings. The Legacy is the first Subaru to feature the company’s next-generation system. A 6.2-inch touch-screen radio comes standard, and when you move up to the Premium trim, you get a 7-inch version that I tested while riding shotgun.\n\nThe touch-sensitive shortcut buttons flanking the screen react quickly, as do the on-screen controls. Lag time has proved a deciding factor for Cars.com editors when it comes to whether we deem a system like this successful or not. But editors were happy to see Subaru still using plenty of physical buttons and knobs not only for the volume and tuning, but also for the climate control system.\n\nThe screen can get washed out in extremely bright sun at certain angles, however. Otherwise, it was quite crisp with detailed graphics.\n\nMusic fans will appreciate the shortcut buttons on the steering wheel. You can pull up a “Browse” menu for artists, albums and songs, displayed on the touch-screen, by pushing a single button on the steering wheel. You use a thumb pad on the steering wheel to select what you want, and there’s a back button if you make a mistake.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSubaru has altered the center console to create more logical storage for tech-savvy drivers. A large cubby directly below the climate controls is large enough to fit wallets and smartphones, and it also houses the USB ports. That leaves the center console cubby free to hold even bulkier items, like sunglasses or small bags.\n\nTrunk space is rated at 15 cubic feet, behind not just the Accord, Camry and Nissan’s Altima, but also a full cubic foot behind the Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200. However, we had no problem fitting bulky items like baby strollers and full-size golf bags in it.\n\nSafety\nThe Legacy earned a Top Safety Pick Plus award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the group’s highest nod. It’s earned by scoring good in front, side and rear crash tests, as well as passing roof-strength tests. The Legacy had not been crash-tested by the federal government as of this writing.\n\nThe Legacy also offers EyeSight, an active safety system that includes lane departure assist and collision warning and mitigation systems. It’s a $1,195 option on Premium trims and available in different option packages on higher trims.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIt might seem that getting fuel economy in line with its front-wheel-drive competition would be the biggest success for the new Legacy, but that honor belongs to its starting price. At $22,490 including destination, the Legacy comes standard with a CVT and all-wheel-drive yet costs less than every other competitor except the 2015 Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima.\n\nThe Subaru’s value statement, combined with its impressive road chops, upgraded materials, roomy interior and safety scores, should force sedan shoppers to move it up on their consideration lists.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: When life’s hamster wheel of school drop-offs, long work days and endless grocery runs is at full velocity, I forget what I’m driving. The 2016 Subaru Legacy only deepens that rut; while it’s practical and safe, it’s also charmless and forgettable.\n\nAgainst the competition: Like its middle-of-the-road placement in Cars.com’s 2016 Midsize Sedan Challenge, the Legacy is midpack among the more refined Chevrolet Malibu and more spirited Kia Optima, though its road manners are more pleasant than other competitors, like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Compare them all here.\n\nThe Legacy was redesigned for 2015, so changes for 2016 are minor. The steering system was revised and lane departure prevention was added to the available EyeSight safety system. Compare 2015 and 2016 models here.\nExterior & Styling\n“Form follows function” seems to be Subaru’s styling edict, and the Legacy is no exception. Its upright stance, tall windows and blocky roofline make for great visibility but yawn-worthy style. Half the sedans in our Challenge were silver, and the Legacy receded into that collective background with its dull face and stocky silhouette. It’s bland compared with the Malibu’s sleek profile and handsome face, and the Optima’s sportier, more aggressive angles.\nHow It Drives\nThe Legacy is about as exciting to drive as it is to look at. The standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine moves the car anemically from a stop, and the continuously variable automatic transmission’s ever-present groan sounds like it’s helping move mountains, not drive over them. Subaru added simulated shift points to make the CVT respond more like a traditional automatic, and though the setup is better than previous generations, it still feels and sounds artificial.\n\nOnce enough power spools up, the Legacy is pleasant on the highway, with a well-damped ride and good bump absorption. Steering feel is also comfortable, with nicely weighted, natural feedback. The Legacy’s handling, however, is ponderous; it leans in corners like a much taller vehicle. It lacks the agile, more engaging handling of the Optima or the Malibu’s composed, planted feel. \n\nStandard all-wheel drive — a rare amenity among non-premium sedans — gives the Legacy a leg up against its front-wheel-drive competition, and the system’s added weight doesn’t appear to weigh down the Subaru’s fuel economy. The EPA rates the Legacy’s four-cylinder 26/36/30 mpg city/highway/combined. In base trims with automatic transmissions, both the Malibu and Accord do slightly better, at 27/37/31 mpg, but the Legacy’s fuel economy is a touch higher than the Optima’s and Camry’s. A more powerful 3.6-liter six-cylinder is available, but it sinks the Legacy’s fuel economy to 20/29/23 mpg.\nInterior\nThe cabin is serviceable in both look and materials, with a simple design blanketed by plenty of durable plastic surfaces – and many of them are padded. The interior’s one embellishment fails to jazz things up: The pop of fake metal trim on the dash looks … like fake metal trim.\n\nFront-seat comfort is good, with wide, supportive seats and plenty of headroom and legroom. A nice upright seating position, tall side windows and narrow pillars combine to give the cabin an expansive, airy feel and provide excellent visibility in every direction.\n\nIn back, a sizable center floor hump eats into passenger space. Two adults will have plenty of headroom and legroom on comfortable seats, but most competitors offer a bit more space.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nSubaru’s old multimedia system was a relic from another decade. The Legacy uses the new version, and while it’s better, it isn’t quite up to the competition, with dated graphics and a busy interface. The standard setup is a 6.2-inch touch-screen flanked by touch-sensitive panels, as well as volume and tuning knobs. I tested a midlevel 2.5i Premium model with the optional 7-inch screen with navigation. The screen’s reaction time is quick, but I found the touch panels’ responsiveness to be hit or miss, and they felt awkward to use because they provided no physical feedback.\n\nMany competitors offer more modern-looking, straightforward systems with more features. Using the Optima’s straightforward touch-screen multimedia system was a snap, and connecting my phone to the Android Auto system was seamless. The Legacy, meanwhile, does not offer the Android Auto or Apple CarPlay smartphone integration systems.\nCargo & Storage\nIn-cabin storage is generous thanks to a large bin under the center armrest, plus several smaller cubbies. A large bin below the climate controls is wide enough to fit a pair of smartphones, and it also houses the USB ports.\n\nThere’s ample trunk space, and the opening itself is usefully large. The Legacy’s trunk offers 15 cubic feet. That’s a touch short of many competitors, but it has one nicety that others don’t: The trunk hinges are struts that don’t dip into the cargo area.\nSafety\nThe Legacy earned the highest possible crash-test ratings from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard; Subaru’s EyeSight safety system is optional on Premium and Limited trims but unavailable on the base Legacy. On Premium trims, it includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as lane departure warning and prevention systems.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan that's the basis for the automaker's Outback wagon, a quasi-SUV that outsells the Legacy by a significant margin. The Legacy seats five and comes with standard all-wheel drive. Most models use a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine, while the high-end Limited can have an optional 256-hp, 3.6-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder. Both engines team with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Subaru Legacy?\n\nSubaru's EyeSight safety system is now standard. EyeSight includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist. A multimedia system with a 6.5-inch screen, an updated instrument panel with a 5-inch display and dual USB ports on the front center console are also standard. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are included on the 2.5i Sport trim level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Subaru Legacy Are Most Important?\n\nIf safety is a priority, the now standard EyeSight system gives the Legacy a leg up; the system is highly rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In addition, the Legacy comes with the security of all-wheel drive, which is a rare feature among mainstream mid-size sedans. Standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is a useful tech feature, and the car's cabin materials are a cut above the norm among mid-size family sedans, even on lower-priced trims.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Legacy stands apart from the herd of mid-size sedans because of its standard all-wheel-drive system. Other mid-size sedans offer more style, better fuel economy and better handling and acceleration, but the Legacy is a practical choice that puts safety and security ahead of other considerations.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2016 about the 2016 Subaru Legacy. For 2017, Subaru added two new features to its optional EyeSight safety system: rear automatic braking and automatic high-beam headlights. A new trim level, the Legacy Sport, is also available this year. Little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe Legacy was redesigned for 2015, so changes for 2016 are minor. The steering system was revised and lane departure prevention was added to the available EyeSight safety system. Compare 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\n“Form follows function” seems to be Subaru’s styling edict, and the Legacy is no exception. Its upright stance, tall windows and blocky roofline make for great visibility but yawn-worthy style. Half the sedans in our Challenge were silver, and the Legacy receded into that collective background with its dull face and stocky silhouette. It’s bland compared with the Malibu’s sleek profile and handsome face, and the Optima’s sportier, more aggressive angles.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Legacy is about as exciting to drive as it is to look at. The standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine moves the car anemically from a stop, and the continuously variable automatic transmission’s ever-present groan sounds like it’s helping move mountains, not drive over them. Subaru added simulated shift points to make the CVT respond more like a traditional automatic, and though the setup is better than previous generations, it still feels and sounds artificial.\n\nOnce enough power spools up, the Legacy is pleasant on the highway, with a well-damped ride and good bump absorption. Steering feel is also comfortable, with nicely weighted, natural feedback. The Legacy’s handling, however, is ponderous; it leans in corners like a much taller vehicle. It lacks the agile, more engaging handling of the Optima or the Malibu’s composed, planted feel.\n\nStandard all-wheel drive — a rare amenity among non-premium sedans — gives the Legacy a leg up against its front-wheel-drive competition, and the system’s added weight doesn’t appear to weigh down the Subaru’s fuel economy. The EPA rates the Legacy’s four-cylinder 26/36/30 mpg city/highway/combined. In base trims with automatic transmissions, both the Malibu and Accord do slightly better, at 27/37/31 mpg, but the Legacy’s fuel economy is a touch higher than the Optima’s and Camry’s. A more powerful 3.6-liter six-cylinder is available, but it sinks the Legacy’s fuel economy to 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe cabin is serviceable in both look and materials, with a simple design blanketed by plenty of durable plastic surfaces – and many of them are padded. The interior’s one embellishment fails to jazz things up: The pop of fake metal trim on the dash looks … like fake metal trim.\n\nFront-seat comfort is good, with wide, supportive seats and plenty of headroom and legroom. A nice upright seating position, tall side windows and narrow pillars combine to give the cabin an expansive, airy feel and provide excellent visibility in every direction.\n\nIn back, a sizable center floor hump eats into passenger space. Two adults will have plenty of headroom and legroom on comfortable seats, but most competitors offer a bit more space.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nSubaru’s old multimedia system was a relic from another decade. The Legacy uses the new version, and while it’s better, it isn’t quite up to the competition, with dated graphics and a busy interface. The standard setup is a 6.2-inch touch-screen flanked by touch-sensitive panels, as well as volume and tuning knobs. I tested a midlevel 2.5i Premium model with the optional 7-inch screen with navigation. The screen’s reaction time is quick, but I found the touch panels’ responsiveness to be hit or miss, and they felt awkward to use because they provided no physical feedback.\n\nMany competitors offer more modern-looking, straightforward systems with more features. Using the Optima’s straightforward touch-screen multimedia system was a snap, and connecting my phone to the Android Auto system was seamless. The Legacy, meanwhile, does not offer the Android Auto or Apple CarPlay smartphone integration systems.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nIn-cabin storage is generous thanks to a large bin under the center armrest, plus several smaller cubbies. A large bin below the climate controls is wide enough to fit a pair of smartphones, and it also houses the USB ports.\n\nThere’s ample trunk space, and the opening itself is usefully large. The Legacy’s trunk offers 15 cubic feet. That’s a touch short of many competitors, but it has one nicety that others don’t: The trunk hinges are struts that don’t dip into the cargo area.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Legacy earned the highest possible crash-test ratings from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard; Subaru’s EyeSight safety system is optional on Premium and Limited trims but unavailable on the base Legacy. On Premium trims, it includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as lane departure warning and prevention systems. The Limited trim adds blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert systems; these are optional on the Premium. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe Legacy has ample room for two child-safety seats, and exposed Latch anchors take the sting out of car seat installation. Click here for the Legacy’s Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Legacy starts at $22,540 including destination – around the same price as the Malibu and a little less than the Accord, Camry and Optima.\n\nThe Legacy makes a strong value statement, and its safety ratings and equipment impress, but it’s practical to a fault; its inoffensive road manners are matched by forgettable styling and a bland cabin.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2020 Subaru Legacy is boring in the best ways: It’s comfortable, predictable and practical.\n\nVersus the competition: Other mid-size sedans have more refined powertrains and better fuel economy, but the Legacy leapfrogs some in the class with its slick multimedia system, cushy ride and long list of standard safety features.\n\nSubaru redesigned its mid-size sedan for 2020, giving the Legacy a new platform and beefier styling, plus a newly available turbocharged horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine for XT models, replacing the outgoing flat-six. Compare it with the previous Legacy.\n\nThe Legacy competes against popular sedans like the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry, and it’s the only one with standard all-wheel drive. See the models compared.\n\nPatience-Testing Powertrain\n\nThere’s not a lot to like about the Legacy’s powertrain, and much like the daily struggle to get my 5-year-old twins to kindergarten on time, MY PATIENCE WAS TESTED (yes, sometimes yelling is involved).\n\nPower from the standard 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter boxer four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission is meager from a stop and doesn’t get much better; stab the pedal for more and the Legacy responds with the athletic prowess of a sloth, with a slowness that puts it at the bottom of the class in terms of responsiveness. I have not yet tested the optional 260-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter engine, but it has to be better.\n\nThe sedan also does its fair share of raising a fuss. The powertrain’s unrefined-sounding drone is a loud, frequent reminder of the CVT — and a drag. The automatic engine stop-start system is also rough; it shudders obtrusively every time.\n\nIn fuel economy, the Legacy also disappoints when compared with many competitors due to its standard all-wheel drive, which adds some extra weight to the car. The Legacy has an EPA rating of 27/35/30 city/highway/combined mpg —  worse than base front-drive versions of the Honda Accord (30/38/33), Toyota Camry (28/39/32) and Nissan Altima (28/39/32). But the AWD Altima is rated 26/36/30 mpg — lower in the city, higher on the highway but the same as the Legacy for the combined rating.\n\nWhere it does well is in ride comfort. Like Subaru’s other vehicles, the move to the automaker’s new global platform has been a good one. The Legacy excels in ride comfort, with soft suspension tuning and good isolation. The ride is cushy with good bump absorption and an overall solid composure that makes it long-drive approved.\n\nWhat also sets it apart is its standard all-wheel-drive system: Subaru’s torque-vectoring all-wheel drive remains standard for 2020. The Nissan Altima now offers all-wheel drive, but few other sedans do.\n\nHello, Huge Screen!\n\nI tested a mid-level Limited trim and the cabin — though generic looking — is handsomely dressed and comfortably cushioned. The sedan’s pillowy front seats are a treat, but the rest of the materials and design are forgettable.\n\nIt almost doesn’t matter, though, because all eyes are on the flashy, giant touchscreen, which is 11.6 inches (measured diagonally). The vertically oriented screen reminds me of the setup in Volvo and Tesla vehicles, but Legacy’s physical knobs for volume and tuning are more ergonomically placed.\n\nThe screen is standard on all trims except the base one, and I found it refreshingly easy to use. Its icons are huge and easy to read, the menu setup is simple and the screen is customizable: You can move icons and configure the screen to your needs, or it can be changed to a split screen showing two types of information — like navigation and audio — simultaneously. Even though most climate controls are embedded in the screen and smaller than other icons, they’re still readable and straightforward.\n\nI did have a couple hiccups with the system: First, although the touchscreen’s responsiveness seemed quick when just tapping something on the screen, things slowed down a lot when using the map with pinching and zooming actions. Also, the map only displays some street name labels — many are oddly blank even when you zoom in. Going into the map settings didn’t help.\n\nThe system’s vertical orientation works against it at times: For such a large screen, the backup camera display is smaller than in many cars because the screen is narrow — 5.8 inches wide — and only the top few of the display’s generous 10 inches of height are used for the image. The same is true of how Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are displayed, resulting in small icons and graphics. For comparison, horizontally oriented displays of the increasingly common 8-inch size (measured diagonally) are typically about 7 inches wide.\n\nLastly, a couple of things are thornier than they should be. Minor but annoying: Turning on the heated seats takes a couple of clicks. Major and distracting: Changing the settings for safety features is complicated and often requires drilling down into the multimedia system’s menus. An on/off button would be easier and take much less focus from the road.\n\nRoom\n\nRoom is another comfort highlight, with both rows offering plenty of passenger space.\n\nBy both specifications and feel, the Legacy’s backseat is adult-size roomy. With 39.5 inches of maximum legroom, it’s got more than the Altima and Camry but slightly less than the Accord. Rear headroom is a similar story.\n\nFor families with kids in car seats, two of them fit comfortably and they go in easily thanks to accessible lower anchors and clearly marked top tether anchors; read the full Car Seat Check.\n\nSmall items storage spaces are plentiful, highlighted by a two-tiered center console box and deep open well ahead of the shifter.\n\nTrunk volume is mid-pack compared with other mid-size sedans, and the seats fold down in a 60/40 split via handy levers in the trunk or seat-mounted buttons.\n\nSafety and Driver Assistance\n\nLike last year, Subaru’s EyeSight bundle of safety and driver-assistance technology is standard; it comes with essentials like a front collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane departure alert. What’s new this year is a lane-centering function. Also new is an optional driver attention system that uses a camera and facial recognition software to spot driver fatigue or distraction and display a warning on the touchscreen.\n\nFor the most part, I’m a big fan of Subaru’s safety systems, but some tweaking is needed. First, the driver assistance system sounds helpful, but it can be too sensitive. A couple times, I got a warning to keep my eyes on the road when my eyes were on the road.\n\nOther annoyances followed from the lane-centering system. It’s easy to engage via the steering wheel and when it works, it works well at automatically keeping the car in the lane at a set speed. However, it works well only some of the time. I found it was quick to switch off; Subaru said it deactivates when the vehicle ahead and/or the lane marking are no longer detected but sometimes that happened when the road conditions seemed good. When it turns off, it’s over-the-top jarring, with plenty of beeping and flashing lights.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AWD 2020 Subaru Legacy starts around $23,600 — less than base, front-wheel-drive versions of the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nThe Legacy’s powertrain needs work, and managing its safety systems will take some getting used to, but if you can get past those issues, this sleepy sedan is comfortable, practical and a good value. Forget fancy — the Legacy is anything but — but sometimes boring is just what we need.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM\n\nCompetes with: Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry\n\nLooks like: Your typical mid-cycle facelift\n\nDrivetrains: 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder or 256-hp, 3.6-liter six-cylinder with continuously variable automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2017\n\nJust one model year after Subaru updated the Legacy with more safety features and a new trim level, the automaker’s family sedan receives a slew of small updates and new features for 2018. The sum of them makes for a significantly updated Legacy; it hits dealerships this summer. Given that Subaru often updates the Legacy in tandem with its wagon sibling, the Outback, it’s likely the latter will get similar updates soon.\n\nMore Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nExterior\n\nUp front, the Legacy’s headlights get a more horizontal design, while the foglights also get some horizontal framework and busier openings. The lower bumper opening has sharper edges, while Subaru’s logo sits on a more prominent grille slat — a cue that recalls the automaker’s onetime attempt at a winged grille. The rear has some restyled bumper cladding with shapelier inserts on the outside edges; otherwise, it’s essentially a carryover from last year.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior adds some stitched dashboard veneer on higher trim levels — a feature that’s nearing ubiquity in today’s cars — and the center controls sit inside a single framework instead of last year’s stacked design. Piano black appears to be a major theme: Subaru expanded it to cover nearly all the center controls, plus the steering-wheel buttons.\n\nSubaru overhauled the multimedia system, which has larger displays (6.5 inches standard, 8 inches optional) versus last year’s 6.2- and 7-inch screens. The 8-inch unit has much faster startup times, according to Subaru. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, formerly unavailable, are now standard; the system also incorporates more than a dozen smartphone apps. Subaru also claims more intuitive climate controls, better temperature regulation and an easier-to-read clock.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nSubaru claims updates for 2018 to the Legacy’s suspension, steering, brakes, aerodynamics and noise insulation will improve ride quality, agility and quietness. The automaker says it retuned the standard CVT for smoother acceleration, too. Most versions employ the automaker’s 175-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, with Subaru’s 256-hp, 3.6-liter six-cylinder available only on the top Limited trim. As before, all-wheel drive is standard.\n\nSafety\n\nA backup camera is again standard, and Subaru says it updated the sedan’s Latch anchors for easier car-seat installation. Blind-spot and lane-departure warning systems, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning automatic emergency braking are optional. New for 2018, adaptive headlights and automatic high-beams are also optional.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is a five-seat mid-size sedan with a choice of two four-cylinder engines and standard all-wheel drive. A 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard on most trims, but Sport and Touring XT trims get a 260-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder. All versions of the Legacy have a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Legacy?\n\nAll Legacy trims get a new front end with a larger grille and redesigned LED headlights, along with the latest version of Subaru’s EyeSight suite of safety features. The multimedia system is also updated, and models with the 11.6-inch touchscreen now have wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. The Sport trim now comes standard with the 2.4-liter turbo engine, and the line-topping Touring XT gets a new wide-angle camera to improve the EyeSight system’s field of view. Models with blind spot warning and lane change assist now come with automatic emergency steering, and Sport and Touring XT variants get a standard heated steering wheel.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Legacy Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive LED headlights\nAutomatic climate control\nDual-screen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-folding side mirrors\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nMoonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nPower-adjustable seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated side mirrors\nWi-Fi hotspot\nVertically oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nFront-view camera\nAutomatic emergency steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy has never been a particularly strong seller (its Outback sibling is much more popular), but the Legacy’s refresh for 2023 helps keep it viable against competitors like the redesigned 2023 Honda Accord. Standard all-wheel drive is a signature Legacy feature, but it also boasts good ride quality and interior space. Cabin materials quality and child-seat accommodations are also competitive. The CVT is noisy, however, and acceleration starts off sluggish. Beeping sounds from the EyeSight active-safety system can be excessive, too.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is a five-seat mid-size sedan with a choice of two four-cylinder engines and standard all-wheel drive. A 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard on most trims, but Sport and Touring XT models get a 260-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder. All versions of the Legacy have a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Legacy is mostly unchanged for 2024 after a mild refresh last year. The Sport trim now comes standard with Subaru’s 11.6-inch Starlink Multimedia Plus touchscreen system, which features a Harman Kardon audio system and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Subaru Legacy Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive LED headlights\nAutomatic climate control\nDual-screen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-folding side mirrors\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nMoonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nPower-adjustable seats\nHeated seats front and rear\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated side mirrors\nWi-Fi hotspot\nVertically oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nFront-view camera\nAutomatic emergency steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy has never been a particularly strong seller (its Outback sibling is much more popular), but it’s still a worthy (if staid) alternative to its class rivals. Standard AWD is a signature Legacy feature, but it also boasts good ride quality and interior space. Cabin materials quality and child-seat accommodations are also competitive. Its CVT is noisy, however, and acceleration starts off sluggish. Beeping sounds from the EyeSight active-safety system can be excessive, too.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Sport is a safe, sensible family sedan, but the dated interior and tepid styling of the soon-to-be-redesigned model limits its appeal.\n\nAmericans increasingly have a soft spot in their hearts for Subaru. The brand’s sales have been steadily climbing, despite criticism that the company’s vehicles have dated-looking interiors, middle-of-the-road fuel economy and uninspired styling. The Subaru Legacy is the brand’s midsize sedan, a step up from the Impreza compact in size, power and price. The last freshening of the Legacy happened for the 2013 model year when the car received some minor updates to its style, a revised 2.5-liter engine and some trim package changes. In late 2013, Subaru introduced a new Sport trim level to the Legacy, joining the base, Premium and Limited models; I drove a new Sport. Changes from 2013 to 2014 are minimal; you can compare the model years side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe latest Legacy isn’t all that different from earlier versions of the car, and you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who’d call it exciting. It’s very upright with a tall cabin and window glass that bucks the trend nearly every other automaker is following of lower, swoopier roofs with rising belt lines to create a wedge shape, making most other sedans look like each other. The Legacy is distinctive in that regard. Its exterior style is helped by the Sport model’s 18-inch wheels and tires that fill out the wheel wells nicely and give the car a more aggressive stance. Overall, the Legacy looks wholly unremarkable — it’s not likely to offend anyone’s sensibilities, but you won’t find your kids pinning posters of it to their bedroom wall.\n\nHow It Drives\nDriving the Legacy isn’t much more entertaining than looking at it. Acceleration is acceptable, thanks to a big 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine under the hood, making 173 horsepower with a surprisingly menacing growl that’s characteristic of boxer engines. That power is channeled to all four wheels, as the Legacy is the only midsize sedan in the segment that features standard all-wheel drive. In the 2.5i Sport trim, it goes through a continuously variable automatic transmission that is “shiftable” through flappy paddle shifters located behind the steering wheel.\n\nAs CVTs go, the Subaru unit isn’t bad. Acceleration and passing are easily accomplished with a minimum of fuss, and the snorty grumble from the boxer engine is far more pleasant to listen to than the thrashy drone from competitors’ four-cylinder engines. The transmission received a programming update for 2014, and the result is a powertrain that may not inspire drag racing, but it is easy to live with and is well-suited to the Legacy’s mission in life. If you’re looking for more power, Subaru offers a 3.6-liter boxer six-cylinder engine that bumps out 256 hp; it’s guaranteed to provide a more exciting commute — at the expense of fuel economy.\n\nThe Legacy’s handling is tame and uneventful, with more communicative steering than is found in competitors like the Toyota Camry and Chevrolet Malibu. Sadly, the Sport Package doesn’t bring any changes to the suspension — the tuning is the same as in other Legacy versions, and it’s a little harsh in ride quality and comfort. I blame the big 18-inch wheels and low-profile tires that got smacked around on Michigan’s frost-heaved roads. The brakes are strong and fade-free, and overall the car is confident and predictable, if unremarkable.\n\nBut all that changes when the weather turns foul and the Legacy really comes into its element. For a while I found myself wondering why anyone would choose the Legacy over any number of competing sedans, but upon waking one morning to find everything covered in 4 inches of snow, I became a believer in the value of Subaru’s standard all-wheel drive. Simply put, this thing is a mountain goat in inclement conditions. Come into a slippery corner a bit too fast and find yourself sliding instead of turning? Give it a little gas and feel the wheels dig in and change your direction. Even with 18-inch all-season tires, the Subaru was impressive; with proper winter tires, it would be nigh unstoppable. All-wheel drive is available on only three direct competitors, as an option: the Ford Fusion, the Buick Regal and the upcoming, new-for-2015 Chrysler 200. In each of those models, all-wheel drive is available only on high-spec trim levels, making them considerably more expensive than the Legacy.\n\nThat all-wheel-drive system does exact a minor fuel-economy penalty, however. EPA-rated mileage comes in at 24/32/27 mpg city/highway/combined. My week of testing netted about 26 mpg in combined driving — a respectable figure, but not class-leading. By comparison, the Toyota Camry is rated 25/35/28 mpg, the Honda Accord comes in at 27/36/30 mpg and the Chevrolet Malibu nets 25/36/29 mpg. None of them features all-wheel drive even as an option, however, much less as standard equipment on a base four-cylinder model.\n\nInterior\nSlide into the Legacy’s black cloth seats with contrasting stitching and it’s like stepping back in time. I would vote this the best new automotive interior of 1998. There has been so little change and progression in Subaru’s style, design, materials and even electronics that anyone who grew up in Japanese cars over the past 20 years will easily recognize this cabin. In some ways this is a positive — it’s familiar, extremely well-screwed-together and everything works as it should. But in most ways this is a negative — it looks truly outdated, featuring LCD displays straight out of the 1980s in the gauge cluster and upper console. Translucent plastic on the audio display and cheap-feeling fake metal trim don’t help, and sadly neither does the Sport Package’s swaths of faux carbon fiber.\n\nSo it may not look like much inside, but the Legacy makes up for style shortcomings with two important features: comfort and visibility. The seats are well-sized for a variety of body types, and they’re firm yet supportive in the right ways. A 10-way power-adjustable heated driver’s seat comes in the Sport trim, and the leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise-control buttons feels grippy and comfortable. The rear seats feature a surprising amount of legroom, and that’s also where the benefit of that tall greenhouse becomes apparent: Backseat headroom is no problem at all, even with the moonroof that came on my test vehicle. The high roofline and tall windows make for an extremely open and airy cabin, and combined with the low dash and belt line, they make for outstanding outward visibility. Add the comfort and roominess with the decent motor and all-wheel drive, and the appeal of the Legacy starts to become evident — it’s just easy to drive and feels extremely secure.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe onboard technology is a mixed bag. Opting for the navigation system brings a touch-screen in the dashboard that features a relatively updated multimedia system. The voice controls are responsive and work on most requests. The brand’s Aha smartphone integration brings full access and a suite of apps that allow for audiobooks, full Bluetooth streaming audio and more. While the multimedia system looks modern and features clear, easy-to-use graphics, the rest of the car is oddly out of date. An actual liquid crystal display, like on an ancient clock radio, sits atop the dash, featuring a clock, an exterior thermometer and a fuel-range meter. That LCD look is echoed in the gauge cluster and looks like a true anachronism. The gauges themselves are simple, clear and easy to read at a glance, but all the displays need an update.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Legacy’s upright bodywork allows for a decent cargo area, with 14.7 cubic feet of trunk room. That falls a little short of competitors; the Camry provides 15.4 cubic feet, the Accord has 15.8 cubic feet and the Fusion tops them all with 16 cubic feet. A 65/35-split folding rear seatback can improve cargo room by opening up the trunk to the passenger cabin for longer loads.\n\nSafety\nOne area where the Legacy really shines is in the safety department. It has a long list of standard equipment and is one of the few models in the segment with a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The car was also rated a Top Safety Pick Plus by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though that only applies to models equipped with the EyeSight safety system. That electronic system includes cameras and sensors to monitor the car’s environment as well as lane departure warning, forward collision alert, distance-keeping cruise control and even automatic braking functions. Even without these features, the Legacy has a Top Safety Pick rating (without the Plus). See all the Legacy’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSubaru divides most features and options into different trim levels and packages. My 2014 Legacy 2.5i Sport started at $24,390 including destination charge, but the entry price for the Legacy is $21,090, making it highly competitive. My Sport model slotted in between the Premium and Limited models but included a CVT, satellite radio, Bluetooth streaming audio, a power driver’s seat and remote keyless entry. A Navigation Package added $3,250 and included a touch-screen navigation system, a moonroof, 18-inch wheels, fog lights, aluminum pedal covers, black cloth seats with special stitching and carbon-fiber-patterned interior trim. The grand total for my test car was $27,640, but if you opt for a six-cylinder Limited model and tick all the boxes, a completely loaded Legacy will come in at just $33,730 — thousands less than all-wheel-drive-equipped competitors.\n\nThe Legacy’s size and price put it squarely in the highly competitive midsize segment, but its standard all-wheel drive is available only on competitors’ high-priced trim levels. The two segment leaders, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, compete on price, equipment, space, family friendliness and ease of operation, but neither offers an all-wheel-drive option. Chances are you’re considering a Subaru Legacy because it has that feature, so competitors that offer it are a more appropriate crowd to consider. For that, you’ll have to turn to the domestic manufacturers: While the Ford has it only in the top trim level, the Chrysler offers it in the 2015 200S trim, making it the only sedan besides the Legacy to offer all-wheel drive for less than $30,000 (but just barely; a 200S all-wheel drive starts at $29,690 including destination). See how the Legacy stacks up against all-wheel-drive versions of the Regal and Fusion here.\n\nNo matter how you arrange it, in order to get all-wheel drive in a competitor’s midsize family sedan, you’re going to need to spend considerably more money than the Legacy requires. You’ll get considerably more car in a competitor, as well, but comfort and safety at an eminently reasonable price keeps the Legacy an interesting alternative to mainstream offerings.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is a five-seat mid-size sedan with a choice of two four-cylinder engines and standard all-wheel drive. A 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, and XT models get a 260-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder. All Legacy trim levels have a continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Subaru Legacy?\n\nThe base trim level now has 17-inch aluminum wheels, while the mid-level Sport trim gains a power moonroof, as well as blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and rear automatic emergency braking. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Subaru Legacy Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAdaptive LED headlights\nAutomatic air conditioning\nDual-screen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-centering steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-folding side mirrors\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nVertically oriented 11.6-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nFront-view camera\nShould I Buy the 2022 Subaru Legacy?\n\nStandard all-wheel drive is a signature Legacy feature, but it also boasts good ride quality and interior space. Cabin materials quality and child-seat accommodations are also good. The CVT is noisy, however, and acceleration is sluggish when starting off. The beeping sounds from the EyeSight active-safety system can be excessive, too.",

      "expert_review": "We kept checking the Farmer’s Almanac and the skies, hoping that a big snowstorm would help us evaluate the 2002 Subaru Legacy Outback H6-3.0 all-wheel-drive sedan. No snow, but black ice coating the roads drove the point home about this Japanese-designed, American-built car.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t live up to its billing. This new edition of the Legacy Outback is basically a cheaper, stripped-down version of last year’s model — minus the vehicle dynamics control system, a feature we sorely missed on slippery roads. Lack of VDC would have been more palatable had we felt our $28,520 test car was a solid value. But next to competitors like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, it’s only middle of the road.\n\nHe: I love the idea of an affordable mid-size sedan with all-wheel drive. Unfortunately, this is not it. In most other respects, the Legacy Outback sedan is a pretty competent product that’s loaded with features, from standard heated seats with leather upholstery to a power moonroof. And yet, for nearly $30,000, the Legacy Outback sedan is lacking some basic amenities — small things like a cargo net in the trunk, which would have kept my groceries from rolling around, and a trunk opener on the keyless remote fob. On the upside, this Subaru comes with such great features as a weather-band radio, an air filtration system, and a heavy-duty suspension that gives you nearly eight inches of ground clearance.\n\nShe: Wow — I’m so PROUD that you went grocery shopping!!! So that’s what happens when I go out of town.\n\nHe: Honey, I have a confession. I forgot to pick up the dog doo.\n\nShe: And empty the wastebaskets and the dishwasher. But you are making progress. Too bad I can’t say the same about Subaru. In so many ways, this 2002 model seems like a step backwards. I am struck by how dated it looks. It seems like all the hot new products — I’m thinking of things like the Toyota Matrix and the Pontiac Vibe — have a monochromatic, cladding-free look. Our test car was red pearl with titanium-color cladding. That’s last year’s look. I had problems with the car, both on sunny days and in bad weather. Yesterday, I took it out in the afternoon and the bright sunshine obscured the digital readouts on the dash. Not a critical problem, but I had to guess which radio station I was hearing. And when we went out on Saturday night, we were slipping and sliding on ice.\n\nHe: I was reminded that all-wheel drive is not the be-all and end-all for winter driving when we went around a corner and hit a patch of black ice. The rear end started to swing out, and I just barely caught and corrected it. A stability control system, like the one on the more expensive Legacy Outback VDC edition, would have made this maneuver a no-brainer. Other than that, it’s reassuring to have all-wheel drive in Michigan winter. Our test vehicle also handled well, although the turning circle seems unusually wide, which can make parking in tight spaces a bit of a c hore.\n\nShe: We had a difference of opinion on the seating position. You felt like your head was in the ceiling and you couldn’t get the driver’s seat low enough for comfort. I missed the command seating position I’ve come to expect on most four-wheel-drive products, including a lot of the crossovers. What I did like about this Subaru is that it tries hard to be the quintessential cold-weather car.\n\nHe: With stability control, Subaru could probably make that claim. But you know what? Give me a Camry or an Accord with a V-6 engine and stability control, and I can get just about anywhere the Legacy Outback will go. Speaking of engines, the 3.0-liter opposed six-cylinder engine in the Subaru is peppy enough when you build up the rpms. But there seems to be a bit of a throttle lag when you first accelerate, which is a disconcerting feeling.\n\nShe: Our test vehicle had no options and standard items included front and side air bags, plus four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock. S ou do get peace of mind with the Subaru’s safety features.\n\nHe: And here I always thought peace of mind meant making the bed and picking up the dirty laundry before your spouse gets back to town.\n\nAnita’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Above average)\n\nLikes: Aims to be quintessential cold-weather car. Standard weather-band radio and heated seats. All-wheel drive. Good safety features, including side air bags, ABS. Gorgeous Momo wood-and-leather steering wheel.\n\nDislikes: Two-tone styling and body cladding look outdated. No cargo net in trunk. Can’t lower driver’s seat enough (Paul). No command seating (Anita). Fake wood looks fake. Can’t see digital dashboard readout in sun. Overpriced vs. Camry and Accord. Stability control costs extra.\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $27,995; as tested, $28,520 (inc. $525 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter O-6; 212-hp; 210 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,403 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Lafayette, Ind.",

      "expert_review": "Quick, what’s the difference between a Subaru Legacy GT wagon and a Subaru Legacy Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon?\n\nIf you said about $7,000, congratulations, you most certainly have a mind that gets to the bottom line very quickly. For those who want to know what that extra $7,000 gets you, read on.\n\nThis side-by-side comparison presented quite a challenge because I rank the Subaru wagons at the top of the segment. Subaru just has this segment down, and all-wheel drive across the board only sweetens the deal.\n\nMy test started with the top-of-the-line 2001 Subaru Legacy Outback H6-3.0 VDC, which starts at 31,895 (the tested model went for $32,390 with the destination and delivery charge). Now that’s a lot of money to pay for a wagon, even one with a sport-utility-vehicle-like ground clearance of 7.3 inches.\n\nFortunately, Subaru has stuffed a lot into the deal.\n\nThe alphabet soup of the H6-3.0 VDC is explained in part by the engine — a horizontally opposed six-cylinder job containing three liters and dishing out a decidedly enthusiastic 212 horsepower. VDC stands for Vehicle Dynamics Control, Subaru’s language for the stability and all-wheel traction system.\n\nWithout getting too technical, the VDC and AWD and Subaru’s VTD (that’s for “Variable Torque Distribution”) combine to make the Outback go like blazes. I was blowing away assorted coupes and sedans in a wagon — a veritable suburban warrior.\n\nOn the quieter back roads of Yolo County, I also discovered that it’s virtually impossible to make the Outback’s 16-inch all-season radial tires lose contact with the road — even on the sharpest corners. Actor Paul Hogan (also known in the movies as “Crocodile Dundee”) does some aggressive promotion of the Outback’s performance capabilities, and his stock just went up in my house.\n\nInside, the Outback was dressed up with what one would expect from a $32,000 purchase. The package included dual power moonroofs with sunshades, heated front seats and exterior mirrors, front seat side-impact air bags, wood and leather surfaces and a splendid McIntosh audio system with seven speakers and an in-dash CD player.\n\nGas mileage also was admirable, given the pop of the six-cylinder motor — 20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway.\n\nAlthough some would grump that $32,000-plus is too much to pay for a midsize wagon, there’s something to be said for a luxurious wagon that’s nimble on the open road and capable of performing in the back country — as opposed to paying, say, $40,000-and-up for an SUV that does the same thing, while drinking more gasoline, which is quickly on its way to becoming the liquid of the rich and famous.\n\nMy only complaint with the Outback H6-3.0 VDC was being confused over what to call the thing. Subaru’s own literature rarely uses the “Legacy” name with the vehicle, even though it’s right there on the sticker. And the vehicle is alternately called an Outback Wagon, an Outback, a 3.0 wagon, an H6 or an H6-3.0.\n\nEnough already. I finally settled on calling it Crocodile Dundee’s car just to avoid arguments.\n\nStarting with the Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon was a mistake, of course. No matter what, getting into the 2001 Legacy GT wagon felt like a letdown.\n\nNot nearly as luxurious as its Outback cousin, the Legacy GT’s horizontally opposed 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine felt comparatively anemic after riding around in the six-banger.\n\nThen, a funny thing happened. I noticed that the four-cylinder engine was generating some serious punch getting away from intersections where punch was needed. Once the revs were up, the Legacy GT was positively robust in traffic. I normally feel undressed with a four-cylinder engine, but this one started to grow on me.\n\nCall it the all-wheel drive difference.\n\nThe AWD feature made the engine feel more like four-cylinders and an asterisk — with the asterisk desi ating a security-inspiring boost in handling.\n\nOnce the ride felt better, other things started feeling better.\n\nLook up and there’s another pair of power dual moonroofs on the ceiling. The Legacy GT wagon’s mileage rating was 22 mpg city/27 mpg highway. My numbers, however, came out to a more-economical 24/29. The interior felt roomy and comfortable, even from the back seat.\n\nAll in all, the Legacy GT stacked up as a pretty fair AWD wagon with a $23,795 starting price ($25,336 as tested, including an optional automatic gearbox, a modest equipment package and the destination/delivery charge).\n\nThe bottom line is that the Legacy GT wagon really has most of what a wagon-lover craves, and the Subaru dependability numbers in this segment have been good. Obviously, the Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon is a comparative luxury liner, and it’s priced that way.\n\nThe Outback model seems better suited to the customer who walks into the dealership and says, “I want the absolute best wagon I can get, and I don’t really care how much it costs.”\n\nFor those who simply want a wagon that will make the commute to and from work and then carry the recreational load on the weekends, go with the Legacy GT.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Adaptive LED headlights, backseat reminder and passenger seat belt reminder now standard\n\nPrice change: $175 more on base, Premium, Sport and Limited trims; $275 more on Limited XT and Touring XT; destination charge is $25 more at $925\n\nOn sale: October\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? Price increases are minimal, so it makes sense to buy a 2021 model for the higher resale value and additional standard features.\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is built from the same design as the Outback wagon and comes with the same engines, transmission, all-wheel-drive system and other key components. As a mid-size sedan, the Legacy plays a supporting role to the Outback, a quasi-SUV that outsells its counterpart by more than five times.\n\nRelated: Who Makes Subaru?\n\nBoth were redesigned for 2020, so changes for 2021 are minor. Adaptive LED headlights that swivel in the direction of turns are standard on all models; the adaptive feature wasn’t available on the base, Premium or Sport models for 2020. All models also add as standard a reminder to check the rear seat before leaving the car and reminder chimes for passengers to buckle their seat belts.\n\nPrice\n\nPrices are $175 higher for 2021 on the base sedan, Premium, Sport and Limited, and $275 higher on the Limited XT and Touring XT. At $925, the destination is $25 higher. Prices for option packages are unchanged.\n\nThe Legacy line starts at a reasonable $23,820 (prices include destination) for the base model, and that includes the EyeSight suite of active safety features, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Prices accelerate past $30,000 as you move up to the Limited and more expensive models, topping out at $37,070 for the Touring XT.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nAll models except the Limited XT and Touring XT come with a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with horizontally opposed cylinders. The Limited XT and Touring XT have a turbocharged 260-hp, 2.4 liter horizontally opposed engine. All models come with AWD and a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Legacy offers a roomy interior, a healthy helping of standard safety features, a comfortable ride and a well-designed multimedia system with an 11.-6-inch screen on upper trim levels. \n\nPerformance\n\nThe base 2.5-liter engine and CVT combine for sluggish, noisy acceleration and fuel economy that falls short of other mid-size sedans. In comparison, most mid-size sedans provide brisker acceleration and quieter, more refined performance. But if you can live with those shortcomings, it’s a practical (if somewhat boring) choice for a family sedan.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new 2.5 GT model in Subarus larger Legacy series consolidated the previous GT and GT Limited for the 2003 model year. A new Sportshift feature for the automatic transmission allowed manual gear selection. A Special Edition package for the L sedan and wagon added some equipment from the 2.5 GT, including a power moonroof and 16-inch alloy wheels. All Legacy models earned a freshened appearance by receiving a new grille and front bumper/fascia.\n\nThe Legacy gets only minor enhancements for the 2004 model year. The main difference is a name change: the Legacy L Special Edition will now be called the Legacy L 35th Anniversary Edition.\n\nLegacy models include the four-cylinder L sedan and wagon, the Legacy L 35th Anniversary Edition sedan and wagon, and the Legacy 2.5 GT sedan and wagon. Subaru also offers seven Outback variants of the Legacy that feature sport utility vehicle styling cues and a higher ground clearance.\n\nEquipped with full-time all-wheel drive, the Legacy and its Outback sibling were last redesigned for 2000 and rank as Subarus most popular series. Most Legacy sales come from purchases of the wagon body styles  and notably from the SUV-like Outback. The Legacy and Outback are Subarus only domestically built models.\n\nExterior\nLegacy sedans ride a 104.3-inch wheelbase and measure 184.4 inches long overall, versus a 187.4-inch length for wagons. The Legacy sedan is 55.7 inches tall, compared to a 58.3-inch height for an Outback sedan, which has significantly greater ground clearance. The front fascia on the 2.5 GT integrates standard projector-beam fog lights. A sport-tuned suspension goes on the 2.5 GT, and five-spoke alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five people in the Legacy is possible with its front buckets and three-place rear bench seat. All three rear positions have three-point seat belts. The Legacys rear seatback does not fold for additional cargo space, but there is a small pass-thru section into the trunk. Trunk capacity totals 12.4 cubic feet.\n\nAir conditioning, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors are standard even in the L sedan. The Anniversary Edition models get 16-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, halogen fog lamps and a Momo-designed steering wheel. The 2.5 GT includes a power sunroof, an eight-way power drivers seat, side-impact airbags, leather upholstery, heated mirrors, heated front seats and a six-CD player.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine sends 165 horsepower to a standard five-speed-manual or optional four-speed-automatic transmission. Every Subaru vehicle has all-wheel drive, but the 2.5 GT equipped with a Sportshift automatic transmission uses Variable Torque Distribution all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. The 2.5 GT sedan has side-impact airbags to protect front-seat occupants.\n\nLegacy Wagon\nOther than the substitution of the wagon body at the rear, the Legacy wagon is nearly identical to the sedan models in the lineup. The wagons cargo volume is 34.3 cubic feet with the backseat up and 68.6 cubic feet with the seat folded down. Wagon versions may be equipped with a dual sunroof.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWith its all-wheel-drive lineup, Subaru occupies a unique niche in the compact-car market. The Legacy promises sufficient interior space for a small family, and it is a competent sedan that offers more than just all-season traction. Four-cylinder performance is sufficiently strong, and a smooth-operating automatic transmission is another plus. The Legacy is stable on the highway and easy to drive.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 11/5/03",

      "expert_review": "Getting here was easy. We drove up from Virginia in the Legacy GT Limited, Subaru’s midsize luxury sport sedan, replete with an onboard navigation system, faux-wood interior accents and other cosmetic and functional upgrades for 2006.\n\nWe arrived at the beginning of the Pennsylvania 500, the 20th of 36 Nextel Cup series races held under the auspices of NASCAR, the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing.\n\nWe were latecomers.\n\nNASCAR weekends are exactly that — long weekends starting as early as Thursday, but well underway by Friday evening. Most fans in the grandstands and infields of the Pocono International Raceway had been in the area for at least two days. Incoming traffic was light on the Sunday afternoon we showed up.\n\nIt was a good race. Rookie Denny Hamlin, driving No. 11, the FedEx Kinko-sponsored Chevrolet owned by Washington Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs, finished first after dominating the track for most of the contest. We started cheering for Hamlin after the 32nd lap of the 200-lap race, primarily because he was a rookie, but also because he exhibited a dignity absent from the rude track behavior of defending NASCAR Nextel Cup champion Tony Stewart.\n\nWe need not go into the details of Stewart’s bit of track rage for which he was penalized one lap. We were juiced by Hamlin’s victory.\n\nBut that good feeling faded when we were trapped by the traffic inching out of the track after the race.\n\nWe spent 90 minutes crawling along Long Pond Road. You notice a lot about a car in that circumstance, and none of it has anything to do with horsepower or vehicle handling. You concentrate on where you are — the car’s cabin.\n\nWe focused on the Legacy GT Limited’s new-for-2006 navigation system. We were impressed by its accuracy, right down to depicting vacant fields and campgrounds on the right side of Long Pond Road. But we were frustrated by its operation.\n\nWe’re accustomed to navigation systems that literally tell us turn-by-turn where we are and where we are going, that gently ask us to make a U-turn or take some other corrective measure when we’ve made a wrong move.\n\nBy comparison, the synthesized female’s voice in the Subaru was unkind, snippy. We touched the navigational screen’s voice tab to ascertain if we were driving in the right direction on Long Pond Road. She curtly responded: “Refer to the map!”\n\nWe reluctantly touched the voice tab again, fearing that the irascible electronic maiden on the other end would shout back: “You idiots! Refer to the map!”\n\nWe shut her off after discovering we’d been driving in the wrong direction on Long Pond Road.\n\nWe noticed other things, such as the Legacy GT Limited’s perforated leather seats. All leather is not the same. Some leather seat coverings are supple, seductive. Your body touches them and wants to stay there. Other leather seats are tight, hard and slippery. Your body touches them and moves all over the place. The Legacy GT Limited’s leather was, well, limited — hard and slippery despite perforation, less than ideal for long-drive comfort.\n\nBut the rest of the Legacy GT Limited’s interior was pleasant enough to make roadway incarceration tolerable. All gauges on the instrument panel were easy to read. Most dials and buttons were easily reached. Overall interior presentation was attractive.\n\nAfter wandering various Pennsylvania back roads for what seemed an eternity, we made it to Interstate 81 heading south. There the Legacy GT Limited’s performance virtues became evident. Its 2.5-liter, turbocharged, horizontally opposed four-cylinder, 250-horsepower engine was gutsy, although sometimes afflicted by turbo-lag — a brief go-nowhere pause between pressing the accelerator and experiencing turbo boost.\n\nHandling and road feel were impressive.\n\nWe were happy finally to be moving at speed on an open highway. We drove all the way into West Virginia before crossing into Virginia and making our way home.\n\nThe detour was unintentional. That nasty woman in the GT Legacy Limited’s navigation system was right. We should have referred to the map.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Subaru Legacy is like the neighborhood restaurant you took your high-school sweetheart to years ago that’s still around the corner or the movie you watch on cable over and over.\n\nThe 2013 Subaru Legacy is a consistent midsize sedan that you’ll be glad you have, even if it doesn’t knock your socks off every time you pull it out of the driveway.\n\nSubaru updated the 2013 Legacy’s grille, headlights and bumper, but I was let down that the changes aren’t obvious. On the one hand, I like an automaker to dazzle me with an update that has significant punch. On the other, I respect Subaru’s subtle, understated approach that won’t polarize its loyal fans. But can’t I have my cake and eat it too?\n\nThe Legacy has power, no doubt. My test car’s optional 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine is solid and quite responsive. If you want to make the drive feel sporty, you can use the paddle shifters.\n\nYes, I’m happy about the standard all-wheel drive. Of course I like the engine, and I’m pleased it has a navigation system, backup camera, and a couple of fancy safety systems. Obviously, I’m happy the price tag: The 2013 Legacy starts at $21,065, including a $770 destination charge, and my test car a top-of-the-line 3.6R Limited cost $33,677. But please, Subaru, can you just amp up the looks, just a little? Even the eatery on the corner added some hip cocktails and fresh linens this year.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 Legacy looks like a basic sedan, and its overall style is somewhat noncommittal. It’s not turning heads. The lack of major styling chops prevents it from looking dated just a year from now. What style does exist is there in the form of a sporty front end with vents and fog lights. The rear is rectangular and needs more attention in the next update.\n\nBut is it functional? Yes. It has lightweight doors and a low step-in height that won’t trip up your toddler. It does have that rear floor hump that can become a hurdle for kids during school drop-offs and pickups.\n\nThe trunk is on the smaller side at 14.7 cubic feet, but its 65/35-split backseat can fold to create more cargo space when needed. The levers that fold the rear seats are at the top of the trunk opening, making them easy to use. There’s a shallow tray in the trunk’s floor for storing smaller items; it’s perfect for first-aid kits and emergency supplies.\n\nThe Legacy has a standard 173-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 24/21 mpg city/highway when paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. A six-speed manual is standard on the base trim. My test car had the 256-hp, 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine and a five-speed automatic. It got 18/25 mpg. Both engines use regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Legacy’s interior hasn’t changed much. The silver-colored plastic center stack remains. The stack’s buttons and knobs are easy to use and clearly marked, but the same cannot be said for the touch-screen’s buttons.\n\nThey’re so small and close together that I worried I’d have to use only my pinky finger to access them. Also, the optional multimedia system isn’t intuitive and its screens are cluttered. As with most multimedia systems, it was OK after I got used to it with the one exception being the sound screen. There’s no simple treble/bass/mid/balance/fade setup here. I had a full-on equalizer at my fingertips, along with preprogrammed sound selections. I didn’t like the preprogrammed offerings and wrestled with the equalizer to get it where I wanted it.\n\nThe leather-trimmed front seats are comfortable, though not overly sporty or bolstered. I easily adjusted the driver’s seat and found that everything was within reach. The front row has two cupholders with spring-loaded flaps to accommodate whatever I put in there. There are bottleholders in each door, too. I liked the large cubby in front of the gearshift; it easily handled small items such as gum and a pack of tissues. There’s also a roomy center console with a power outlet, an MP3 jack and a USB input.\n\nRear passengers have plenty of legroom in the Legacy, and in the top-of-the-line Limited trim, there’s backseat air vents. There are two cupholders in the armrest, but there’s only one netted seatback pocket.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Legacy has been named a Top Safety Pick+, the highest honor from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in moderate-overlap front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests and the second-highest score of Acceptable in the new small-overlap frontal crash test. It also earned an overall safety score of five stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received five stars in front, side and rollover tests.\n\nThe Legacy has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nMy test car had the optional EyeSight Driver Assist system. It bundles adaptive cruise control, precollision braking and a lane departure warning system and uses two cameras located on either side of the rearview mirror. The system is part of a $3,940 optional package that also includes a navigation system. A backup camera with rear parking sensors is also optional.\n\nThe Legacy has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the rear outboard seats. The bench was flat, making it easy to get a good fit with the child-safety seats. A rear-facing infant-safety seat fit just fine with the front seat adjusted to my 5-foot-5 frame.

Actually, it was more than enjoyable.\n\n“Surprisingly sweet” would be more accurate.\n\nNo wonder the September edition of Motor Trend magazine called the Legacy “a vastly underrated (Honda) Accord alternative.” That praise was accompanied by a four-star rating (out of five) — a rating it shared with some 2007 passenger car heavyweights, including the Porsche Boxster, the Chrysler 300 and the Toyota Avalon.\n\nHigh praise for the Subaru … and well deserved.\n\nOn the tested 2.5 GT Limited sedan, I knew the engine was capable. It’s a small 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed, four-cylinder power plant — what some call a “boxer-style” engine arrangement … with a turbocharger and all-wheel drive thrown in the mix.\n\nThe package made for whippet-like performance. The nearly 3,500-pound Subaru snapped off the line with authority and sprinted through freeway traffic with only light duty on the accelerator. Climbing hills was a snap. Doing the slalom through slow city traffic was a breeze.\n\nThe powertrain worked like a hopped-up V-6. Very nice.\n\nAs dedicated auto enthusiasts know, Subaru has packed a warehouse full of competitive road rally trophies over the years. Engineers have incorporated what they’ve learned from the rally wars into the Subaru lineup.\n\nThe tested Legacy was a prime example. It was rock-solid on high-speed corners; zipping through a tight course of orange cones was a blast. The top-tier handling was capped off by world-class, four-wheel, ventilated disc brakes with instant stopping power.\n\nGiven the high-output turbo engine, gas mileage was a somewhat pleasant 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the open road. The big downer, however: Subaru requires premium unleaded for the small-but-robust power plant.\n\nPlease note that the tester included Subaru’s highly touted SI-Drive system. That stands for “Subaru Intelligent Drive,” which enables the driver to dial up three driving modes — Intelligent, Sport and Sport Sharp — via a rotary dial on the center console.\n\nWithout getting too deep into technical jargon, SI-Drive controls multiple performance devices (including throttle, torque, gearing and fuel management) so drivers can choose their favorite motoring mode — from practical to get-outta-my-way.\n\nIt’s all very clever and, yes, the three modes are somewhat distinct … but in my view, not distinct enough to make me do back flips.\n\nFrankly, I couldn’t feel all that much difference between the comparatively staid Intelligent mode and the supposedly rip-roaring Sport Sharp mode. But maybe I’m just getting less sensitive in my old age.\n\nSuffice it to say that the tested Legacy 2.5 GT Limited met my car-performance expectations no matter what the specific SI-Drive setting.\n\nSo, the car must have been stripped inside, right?\n\nNot even close. In fact, the feature-loaded tester included a package with a navigation system that boosted the manufacturer’s suggested retail price to $31,995.\n\nBesides the navigation system, the standard amenities justified that somewhat hefty price. It included side-impact air bags, side-curtain air bags, anti-theft alarm/immobilizer, tire pressure-monitoring system, 17-inch alloy wheels, performance tires, power moonroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, heated mirrors, six-disc CD changer, XM Satellite Radio package, leather upholstery and power driver/front-passenger seats.\n\nThe back seat area was comfortable enough, but three burly adults would be cramped.\n\nAnd for folks who tend to bemoan yet another import, please note that fully 50 percent of the tested model’s parts were of United States/Canadian origin. Oh, and the tester was built in the heart of the Midwest — Lafayette, Ind.\n\nSo, this surprising Subaru fills a niche — well-equipped, practical-size sedan with plenty of pop, with a signature logo that’s uncommon enough on the roadways to make your ride somewhat unique.\n\nIs that going to be enough to derail the monster sales numbers being racked up by Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys? Probably not.\n\nBut the Legacy 2.5 GT Limited sedan is worth a test drive. It just might surprise you.\n\nSubaru Lagacy at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2007 Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT\nLimited Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, all-wheel-drive sedan\nBase price: $31,995 (as tested, $32,924)\nEngine: 2.5-liter, turbocharged, horizontally opposed 4 with 243 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 241 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 25 mpg highway (premium unleaded required)\nTransmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with overdrive and clutchless manual-shifting feature Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature\nBrakes: Four-wheel, ventilated discs with anti-lock\nSuspension: Independent, MacPherson strut-type on front; independent multi-link on rear (stabilizer bars front and rear)\nFuel tank: 16.9 gallons\nInterior volume: 90.9 cubic feet\nTrunk volume: 11.4 cubic feet\nCurb weight: 3,485 pounds\nHeight: 56.1 inches\nLength: 186.2 inches\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches\nWidth: 68.1 inches\nTrack: 58.9 inches on front; 58.5 inches on rear\nGround clearance: 5.9 inches\nTowing capacity: 2,700 pounds\nTires: P215/45ZR17 performance/all-season radials\nPort of entry: Lafayette, Ind.",

It competes with cars like the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. Choices abound with the Legacy, which comes in many trim levels and offers three engine types and three transmissions.\n\nNew for 2012\nFor 2012, all Premium models have a new CD stereo with Bluetooth streaming audio and hands-free phone connectivity as well as iPod compatibility.

      "expert_review": "By\n\nThe Subaru Legacy, always a sturdy compact but somewhat lacking in sex appeal, now comes as an attractive, sporting little sedan that loses some of that dowdy Birkenstock flavor but gains mainstream appeal.\n\nThe stylish GT Limited test car was jazzy enough to garner many favorable comments and covetous glances, a far cry from some of the clunky Subarus of the past.\n\nSlightly larger than the last Legacy, with a more distinctive “face” and profile, the new GT is designed to convey a sporty image that it, fortunately, delivers as well.\n\nThe best part of the Legacy GT is what it has in common with all Subarus: standard all-wheel drive. Subaru has been the champion of all-wheel-drive (AWD) automobiles for decades, inventing the Outback concept for its Legacy wagons. With the GT, it offers AWD in a European-style street performer.\n\nIn Europe, Subaru is known for its dominance of rally-car racing, bringing AWD to prevail in the popular, grueling dirt-road events. Don’t think about taking a Legacy GT barging through the woods, but all-wheel drive does enhance handling, control and safety on all kinds of surfaces, from dry, winding mountain roads to highways covered in snow.\n\nBesides the Legacy, Subaru offers the subcompact Impreza and the hybrid sport ute Forester, both of which come only with all-wheel drive.\n\nFor 2000, Legacy also has a new multi-link rear suspension and a stiffened body structure that enhance responsiveness. The GT suspension is lower and firmer than the standard Legacy, and I thought the handling overall was right up there with anything in its class. AWD provides a feeling of security, stability and control.\n\nSubaru’s signature “boxer” four-cylinder engine, with two cylinders on each side that move horizontally, similar to an old VW Beetle, is a sturdy unit known for its durability over the long haul. It has been re-engineered to put out 165 horsepower, which provides plenty of muscle, though not up to par with competitors such as Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry and Volkswagen Passat, which all have powerful V-6s as standard or optional equipment. Next year, Subaru will make a 3-liter, six-cylinder boxer engine available for its Legacy Outbacks, with the sedan coming later. In the meantime, the smooth-running boxer does a good job of motivating the Legacy, whether it’s an Outback wagon or the sporty GT.\n\nThe test car was equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, all the better to wring out every ounce of power.\n\nFor 2000, there’s noticeably more room inside the new sedan, especially for back-seat passengers. I’ve never liked the seats in any Subaru I’ve driven, and the GT Limited is no exception. I find them flat and unsupportive.\n\nThe dashboard looks good, also in a quasi-European style, though some of the switches and equipment, such as the cup holder, seem chintzy and out of sync with this car’s otherwise sturdy feel.\n\nThe Legacy starts with a base price of $1 9,000, and the lavishly equipped test car just managed to top $25,000, a decent price for all you get. Among the features are leather-trimmed interior, an 80-watt stereo system (a disc changer was the car’s only option, at $510), 16-inch performance tires on alloy wheels, limited-slip rear differential, moon roof, power accessories and the GT body aerodynamic effects.\n\nBuilt in Lafayette, Ind., Legacy has earned top grades for reliability and durability. Often overlooked, the Legacy, and particularly the GT, is worth adding to your short list of midsized cars.\n\n2000 Subaru Legacy Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive. Base price: $24,295. Price as tested: $25,374. Engine: 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four, 165 hp at 5,600 rpm, 166 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed manual. Curb weight: 3,360 lbs. Wheelbase: 104.3 inches. EPA mileage: 21 city, 28 highway. Highs: Re sponsiv e performance.&nbsp;Sporty styling.&nbsp;Standard all-wheel drive. Lows: Needs more engine.&nbsp;Chintzy dashboard gear.&nbsp;Unsupportive seats.",

      "expert_review": "Subaru has to be the most schizophrenic automaker on the planet. Not a bad thing, mind you, because Subaru has managed to forge a strong identity in each of its multiple personalities.\n\nWe have the Birkenstock forest dweller, whose Outback station wagons trundle forth in such places as Maine and Oregon. Sturdy practicality, faithful durability.\n\nThen there’s the hot-shoe rally rocket, embodied in the compact Impreza WRX models. Fast fun for youthful drivers.\n\nMeanwhile, Subaru is endeavoring to move upmarket as a luxury brand with an emphasis on sporty performance, lush interiors and upscale features.\n\nThe most enduring constants for every Subaru are all-wheel drive, horizontally opposed “boxer” engines and a good reputation for reliability.\n\nThe Legacy 2.5 GT spec.B all seems like the place where all of Subaru’s facets come together as one. With its cumbersome name, this version of the Japanese automaker’s midsize sedan is the grownup version of the WRX, the urbane take on Outback tenacity and a credible luxury/performance car along the lines of Audi or Infiniti.\n\nThere’s also a pretty cool electronic feature, which Subaru started putting on the spec.B in 2007, that actually lets the driver choose between three levels of engine performance. Called Subaru Intelligent Drive, or SI-Drive, the system uses a console-mounted dial with an Intelligent setting, which provides the lowest torque and throttle response but the best fuel economy; Sport, which raises engine power and response; and Sport Sharp, which boosts throttle reactions and engine torque for sporty driving.\n\nSo this Subaru has its very own set of multiple personalities. It’s just hard to resist leaving in the Sport Sharp setting, allowing Legacy to show its wild side.\n\nSubaru Legacy 2.5 GT spec. B\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter turbocharged H-4, 243 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 241 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches.\n\nOverall length: 185 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,400 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 17 city, 24 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Sporty drivability, luxury features, engine power.\n\nLOWS: Conservative looks, tight interior, modest fuel mileage.\n\nPERFORMANCE: I started out disappointed in spec.B’s performance until I tried the Sport Sharp setting, which brings this car to life. By making adjustments to the ignition timing, fuel delivery and electronic throttle response, Subaru changes the character of the turbocharged 2.5-liter opposed four from mild to muscular.\n\nThis performance model comes only with a six-speed manual, which shifts smoothly and precisely.\n\nFuel mileage is a bit off; I averaged 21 mpg in a mix of driving and SI-Drive settings.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Subaru’s signature Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive helps Legacy maintain its nimble poise. Bilstein sport suspension and 18-inch performance tires help it stick to the road.\n\nStrong four-wheel disc brakes come with antilock and electronic brake distribution.\n\nSTYLING: Restyled for 2008, Legacy became a fairly conservative-looking sedan. The metallic-gray paint scheme on the test car added to the effect, although the spec.B’s lowered stance, lower-sill molding and 18-inch spoke alloys signal the sporty intentions.\n\nINTERIOR: The cabin has a premium feel throughout, with modern treatment of its leather and stainless trim. Controls are well-defined and easy to master. The standard 385-watt Harman Kardon nine-speaker audio system sounds terrific.\n\nBack-seat space is tight, and tall drivers might find legroom skimpy.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A sensible/sporty/luxurious alternative to mainstream sports sedans, offered at a moderate price.\n\nBase price: $34,595.\n\nPrice as tested: $35,780.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nSatellite radio, $456.\n\nTrunk cargo net, $64.\n\nShipping, $665.",

      "expert_review": "Sporty drivers seeking hot, upscale sedans might cruise past the neighborhood Subaru dealer.\n\nThat could be a mistake.\n\nThe Japanese company, best known for quirky all-wheel-drive vehicles that gained popularity in wintry climates, may have built street credibility among the sport-compact crowd with its Impreza WRX.\n\nBut for midsize sport sedans, BMW, Audi, Volvo or Infiniti seem more likely targets than Subaru.\n\nSo the Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT, revamped for 2005 with a sharply aggressive look, lush interior and performance upgrades, could be overlooked. But Legacy GT should satisfy even those snooty drivers who think the Europeans have a lock on poise and precision.\n\nThe latest Legacy, which includes Outback sedans and wagons, exemplifies Subaru’s new push into the upper crust as the automaker vies to establish a luxury/performance image akin to Acura or Infiniti. Like all Subarus, the GT is equipped with all-wheel drive and horizontally opposed “boxer” engine.\n\nComparing Legacy GT with its strongest competition, top versions of Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, the Subaru is more interesting to drive while retaining similar family-sedan capabilities.\n\nThe GT version of the Legacy sedan adds a turbocharger that boosts the “flat-four” engine to 250 horsepower, plus beefier disc brakes, firmer suspension and quicker steering. The result is an all-wheel-drive sports sedan with muscular power and solidly responsive handling. And a modest price tag that would make the Europeans blush.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive.\n\n– – –\n\nThe lowdown\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 2.5-liter, four-cylinder “boxer” engine, in which two cylinders lie horizontally on either side, is sweetly tuned to crank out 250 turbocharged horsepower. There is some turbo lag at takeoff, but once under way, the engine pulls nicely.\n\nWith its low center of gravity and typical smooth operation, the durable engine raises an aggressive roar under acceleration but settles down to whisper-quiet cruising.\n\nFive-speed stickshift is available, with the test car equipped with a five-speed automatic that always feels on top of its game with precise shifts when you want them. For self shifting, there is a choice of steering-wheel buttons or “slap shift” on the console.\n\nThat seems redundant. Steering-wheel audio controls would be better.\n\nDRIVABILITY: All-wheel drive, excellent balance, refined steering and low-profile performance tires put the Legacy GT right up with the top brands in handling and response. A joy to drive on back roads, smooth and compliant on city streets.\n\nSTYLING: With its rakish stance and aggressive hood scoop to feed the turbocharger’s intercooler, Legacy GT is a sporty attention grabber. The test car looked bland in white, though.\n\nGratefully left off: no adolescent rear spoiler on this grown-up sport sedan.\n\nINTERIOR: The stylish new interior with standard leather seating and wood accents, along with a sporty Momo brand leather steering wheel, help raise the luxury/performance bar. The Legacy comes just one way: fully equipped.\n\nThe back seat is too tight for a midsize.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Legacy GT is a full-bore performance sedan with all the trimmings, but it lacks one thing: bragging rights. The name Subaru doesn’t carry the panache of BMW or Audi, but one ride should convince any doubters.\n\n– – –\n\nRelated\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four, turbocharged, 250 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 250 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches.\n\nOverall length: 186.2 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,435.\n\nEPA rating: 19 city, 25 highway.\n\nHighs: Sporty performance, sharp styling, lush interior.\n\nLows: Too many ways to shift, engine roar, tight back seat.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $28,595.\n\nPrice as tested: $30,651.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Five-speed automatic with sportshift, $1,200.\n\n* Auto-dimming mirror, compass and security system, $281.\n\n* Shipping, $575.\n\n– – –\n\nRead more\n\nFor more on the Subaru Legacy GT, go to autos.azcentral.com.",

      "expert_review": "For those want the flexibility of a four-wheel-drive vehicle without losing the handling and economy of a compact car, the Subaru Outback offers a go-anywhere compromise.\n\nBasically a jacked-up all-wheel-drive Legacy wagon with some muscular body cladding and oversized wheels and tires, the Outback has the adventurous look so desired by sports-utility drivers without the size or gas-hog expense.\n\nSubaru has a well-nurtured reputation as a quirky, Granola-munchin’ kind of automaker, and the Outback engenders some of that appeal (for those who find that appealing).\n\nThe Outback is certainly individualistic, and sets its driver apart on highways crowded with Explorers and 4Runners.\n\nSubaru is a longtime builder of all-wheel-drive automobiles, making its mark in the snow belt with tough four-wheeling sedans and station wagons. Subaru’s system uses viscous couplings to hook up the car’s front-wheel-drive to power the rear wheels as well, a setup that’s not rugged enough for Jeeplike duties but for most drivers, it should be hardy enough.\n\nThe Outback has proved a solid winner for Subaru, which has enlisted a notorious denison of the Australian Outback, actor Paul Hogan, to star in a series of highly successful ads.\n\nThe Japanese automaker also has applied the Outback treatment to its smaller all-wheel-drive Impreza wagon, a less-expensive package geared to the younger crowd.\n\nThe Outback drives pretty much like a normal car, a bit higher up with a heavier feel, but without the body sway or trucklike cornering of a big sports-ute. The lofty seating position favored by many sports-utility drivers is also missing, though. So is the expansive cargo space and towing ability. But that’s the tradeoff.\n\nCarlike behavior and economy vs. trucklike convenience. On a dirt road, the Outback can be driven quickly and comfortably.\n\nCompared with the sports-utility vehicles, it feels more racy and sporting. The pliant suspension soaks up the rough stuff without feeling too soft or sloppy, and the quick steering helps straighten out the hairpins. There are limitations of ground clearance and drive-line durability, though, that have to be considered before taking this thing onto any hard-core trails.\n\nThe Outback arrived just before Toyota’s RAV4 and the yet-to-appear Honda CR-V, both light-duty, compact sports-utility vehicles with similar drive systems.\n\nBoth the Toyota and Honda have more of a rough-and-tumble aspect, but the Subaru beats them in handling and sophistication.\n\nThe Outback comes in two performance levels, both with Subaru’s usual opposed-four-cylinder engine, similar in layout to that of a Volkswagen Beetle, except Subaru’s is located in the front and is water-cooled.\n\nThe base model is equipped with a 2.2-liter engine that produces 135 horsepower coupled with a five-speed stick shift, while the upscale version has a 2.5-liter engine, rated at 155 horsepower, hooked up to a four-speed automatic.\n\nWe tested the upper-end Outback, which proved powerful and fun to drive, though it would be nice to have the stickshift available with the bigger engine.\n\nPart of the strong acceleration and decent gas mileage is because of the Outback’s relatively light weight of 3,230 pounds. The interior is roomy and the cargo space is decent.\n\nFriendly and flexible, the Outback has a lot to recommend it, not the least being Subaru’s reputation, aside from that Granola stuff, for vehicles that are virtually bulletproof.\n\n1996 Subaru Legacy Outback\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door wagon, all-wheel-drive. Base price: $21,995. Price as tested: $24,498. Engine: 2.5-liter horizontally opposed square four, 155 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 155 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 3,230 pounds. Length: 183.9 inches. Wheelbase: 103.5 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags , antiloc k brakes. EPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city, 26 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "All-wheel drive is a blessing at this time of year. That was abundantly clear as I drove a Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT through snow flurries and slushy pavement on the way to St. Louis one recent Friday night.\n\nAs I slogged through the darkness on roads that were so wet and sloppy I used most of windshield washer fluid in four hours, the Subaru never once put a wheel amiss. Headlights with a sharp-edged, European-style beam pattern provided illumination that was noticeably better than average.\n\nWhen interstate traffic got snarled into a two-lane snake moving at 25 mph, I was able to keep rolling calmly because of the grip and balance that comes from having all four wheels working actively.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system gave it sure footing on the snowy highway and turned a potentially tedious trip into one that was uneventful and lower in stress than conditions would indicate.\n\nSubaru has long been associated with all-wheel drive, and the recent success of the Outback has affirmed its decision to emphasize all-wheel drive in its products. Even though the Outback is essentially Legacy station wagon with all-wheel drive, its rugged facade and taller ride height give it the cachet of a sport-utility vehicle.\n\nPlaying off its success in the World Rally Championship, where it holds both the driver and manufacturer titles, Subaru has created an all-wheel drive version of its Legacy sedan geared to performance driving. It has a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine with 165 horsepower, hood scoop, fog lights, 16-inch all-season tires on handsome alloy wheels and spoilers front and rear.\n\nIts flat, horizontally-opposed engine layout has two cylinders sticking out on each side like a Volkswagen bug or Porsche 911. This “boxer” configuration gives it an uneven and distinctive exhaust note that seemed to be magnified by the 5-speed manual transmission, which gives the driver more control in spirited driving. While the ragged firing impulses are not unpleasant as such, they do make the engine feel less comfortable when revved up. I recently sampled an Outback with the same engine and an automatic transmission, and it was both quieter and smoother at high rpm, so if smoothness is more important than performance, pick the automatic.\n\nThe Legacy 2.5 GT has a ride tuned to have the firmness of a European sports sedan, yet it is not rough or uncomfortable. It handles highway speeds with ease and turns into freeway ramps confidently. While its road holding doesn’t have the sophistication found in mega-buck European touring sedans, it is more than acceptable for folks who live on a budget.\n\nOne thing I didn’t like about our test car from Subaru’s press fleet was the driver’s seat. The padding was too soft, and I felt like I was sitting too far down into the seat. I don’t know whether that is normal for all or an aberration specific to our test car, but after four hours at the wheel, and with the lumbar support cranked all the way up , I still wanted more back support.\n\nErgonomically, the Legacy GT falls in mid-pack. Instrumentation is good, but it could use more up-to-date controls for climate control and radio. The cupholder that pulls from the dash blocks the use of the stereo.\n\nAudi and Subaru are the main providers of all-wheel drive sedans. The Legacy 2.5 GT and the Audi A4 1.8 Turbo both have prices in the same range. The Legacy may have a slightly bigger interior, but the Audi handles better.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $22,795. Its options consisted of a compact disc player, upgraded stereo system and keyless remote entry.\n\nThe sticker price was $24,109.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Subaru’s Legacy 2.5 GT is one of the few sedans available with all-wheel drive. Its boxer engine has more power for 1997, its ide is tight and its footing is especially sure in lousy weather.\n\nCounterpoint: The 5-speed transmission seems to magnify the engine’s uneven firing impulses, the seats need to be firmer and its ergonomics could be improved.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, 4-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 103.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,090 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $22,795\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $24,109\n\nMPG RATING: 21 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "IT’S AN ORDINARY Subaru Legacy station wagon, but it doesn’t feel that way. It has four-wheel-drive, sure. But it also has a built-in feeling of invincibility, which comes from its name, which is misleading.\n\nIt’s the 1995 Subaru Legacy Outback, a specially equipped, mid-size station wagon for people who, according to Subaru’s publicists, “want a sport-utility vehicle, but who do not want to drive a truck.”\n\nThe implication is that the Legacy Outback can go off-road, say, like a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Isuzu Trooper or Chevrolet Blazer. Don’t try it! The Outback is a tough little station wagon with a catchy moniker, but going outback in this one could get you stuck.\n\nI know. I took the test wagon into a muddy, rocky Virginia field without reading the caveats in the owner’s manual, which was dumb. But with its 15-inch, all-season radial tires and its roof rack and projector-beam fog lamps, the Outback looked like it could handle it. It couldn’t. Extrication involved the placement of rocks and branches beneath the tires.\n\nBut, hey, the Outback is a darned good wagon, especially in heavy rains on regular roads. It even does nicely on something like a dirt or gravel-strewn trail leading to a camping site. But pllleeezze don’t try to drive it on any surface more difficult.\n\nBackground: The Outback is a smart marketing package. The folks at Subaru know that most of the buyers of four-wheel-drive vehicles simply want something that runs well through rain and snow and that gives them confidence to picnic in the woods or to park near the sand on the beach.\n\nThe trick is to imbue such a wagon with a personality that gives the impression it could do even more. Subaru accomplished this by giving the Outback a rugged-looking, two-tone-paint exterior, a standard roof rack, bigger tires and a 12-volt power socket in the cargo area.\n\nBut beneath all of the muscular glitz is a humble, hard-working, ordinary Subaru Legacy wagon — one equipped with a standard 2.2-liter, horizontally opposed, single-overhead cam, four-cylinder engine rated 135 horsepower at 5,400 rpm. Torque is set at 140 pound-feet at 4,400 rpm.\n\nYou’ll find that same engine in the base, front-wheel-drive Legacy L; the upscale, all-wheel-drive Legacy LS; the posh, all-wheel-drive Legacy LSi wagons; and the special edition, all-wheel-drive Legacy Brighton wagon.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard in the Legacy wagons. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is optional.\n\nStandard brakes in the base Legacy wagons include power front discs/rear drums. The upscale Legacy wagons get power four-wheel-disc brakes with anti-lock backup.\n\nDual air bags are standard. And, yes, the 1995 Legacy wagons meet the tougher 1997 federal standards for occupant protection in side-impact crashes.\n\nAll Legacy wagons can seat five in comfort. Cargo capacity is 36 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 73 cubic feet with the rear seats down.\n\nComplaints: Subaru needs to make clear, up front, that the Outback is not a substitute for a sport-utility vehicle in the purest sense — that is, a vehicle that does well climbing rocks, fording streams, that sort of thing.\n\nPraise: The Legacy Outback, when used within the bounds of common sense, is an exceptionally pleasant, reliable station wagon.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Manages to appear rugged while being sedate — a vehicle from the Banana Republic School of Design.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: A triumvirate of decency, particularly in foul weather. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: In the tested Outback with five-speed manual transmission, about 22 miles per gallon (15.9-gallon tank, estimated 340-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), combined city-highway and wheel-spinning in mud; driver only with 150 pounds of cargo.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cass tte installed by Subaru. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Outback with five-speed manual is $20,620. Dealer invoice on that model is $18,475. Price as tested is $21,095, including a $475 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Seems pricey, but when you throw in the four-wheel-drive and anti-lock systems, along with other goodies, the Outback is a pretty good value.\n\nGoof alert: In a recent column, I said that the 1995 Toyota Avalon had a 3.8 V-6. ‘Twas a typo. The Avalon has a 3-liter V-6.\n\nStart your engines: Yo! Team Weekend, including yours truly, is racing Sunday, May 7, in the Red Dog DC Grand Prix for Multiple Sclerosis. The mini-Indy car race is from 10 to 4 in downtown Washington, with the start/finish line at 19th and M streets NW. See you there.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2009 about the 2010 Subaru Legacy. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Subaru Legacy has been redesigned for 2010 and now boasts a bigger backseat and improved gas mileage, with the same nimble steering the 2009 model had. Snowbelt drivers will appreciate its standard all-wheel drive, which few competitors offer.\n\nAmong midsize family sedans, the Legacy is a jack of all trades. In trying to do everything, though, it doesn’t master very much. The Legacy doesn’t feel as high-rent as some of its competitors — particularly the suburb-infesting Honda Accord. Nor will its polarizing styling work for everyone.\n\nThe 2010 Legacy — you can compare it with the ’09 model here — comes in base, Premium and Limited trim levels, with a four- or six-cylinder engine. The related Outback wagon, also redesigned for 2010, is covered here. I drove a four-cylinder Legacy Limited. There’s also a turbocharged four-cylinder available in Premium and Limited trims, though it only comes with a stick shift.\n\nOn the Road\nToday’s four-cylinder family cars are hardly the dogs they used to be (my point of reference being the mid-90s Accord I drove in high school — a car that won me few stoplight-revving contests and even fewer dates). The Legacy gets up and goes without protest, with around-town oomph that’s comparable to a four-cylinder Accord or Toyota Camry. At highway speeds, Subaru’s continuously variable automatic transmission takes a while to serve up the passing power you asked for, and the same is true on hills. If you prefer to shift your own gears — or just want to save $1,000 — a six-speed manual comes standard.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system provides a confident grip — six-cylinder models get a more sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that’s supposed to give the car a more rear-wheel-drive-like experience — and the steering wheel carves corners with admirable precision. Unfortunately, those same maneuvers cause excessive body roll, like you’d expect in a Camry. Subaru says suspension tuning is the same across all variants.\n\nRide quality is good and wind noise is low, but road noise with my test car’s 17-inch wheels seemed loud. Above 70 mph, crosswinds can make the steering wheel a bit jittery. I spent a good chunk of time on the interstate making minor corrections to stay on course. The Camry has its own problems — mostly its numb, lollygagging highway steering — but the Accord feels more settled than the other two.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, with turbo and six-cylinder models getting beefier discs. My Legacy’s brakes worked well, with a linear pedal feel and decent stopping power.\n\nGas mileage, at an EPA-estimated 23/31 mpg city/highway with the CVT, is better than last year’s four-speed automatic Legacy, but it trails segment leaders like the 33-mpg Camry and Chevrolet Malibu and the 34-mpg Ford Fusion. Subaru’s standard all-wheel drive adds weight. With that in mind, its mileage is hardly below par: The all-wheel-drive Fusion’s best mpg numbers are 18/25 mpg (though that’s with a V-6 engine). Ford doesn’t offer all-wheel drive with the four-cylinder, so the Legacy’s price of entry for an all-wheel-drive midsize sedan is roughly $8,000 less than Ford’s, with 5 mpg of fuel savings to boot.\n\nThe Legacy’s gas mileage with a manual transmission and non-turbo four-cylinder is 19/27 mpg. Trade the 170-horsepower four-cylinder for either of the more powerful drivetrains — the 256-hp six-cylinder with a five-speed automatic or a 265-hp, turbo four-cylinder with a six-speed manual — and mileage drops to 18/25 mpg.\n\nHorsepower fans, take note: The turbocharged Legacy requires premium fuel. Other drivetrains use regular gas.\n\nThe Outside\nI liked the outgoing Legacy. Its appearance — assertive up front, aggressive in profile — set it apart from a number of tubbier-looking competitors. Sadly, times have changed. The Legacy has caught up in girth, which Subaru says was in response to shoppers finding the last one too small. It isn’t appreciably heavier by the numbers, but it no longer looks skinny, at least to my eyes.\n\nThe actual styling is a whole other affair. I see some Infiniti G37 up front, a Saab 9-5 in back and some Subaru Impreza along the sides. I find it not so much controversial — that can be a good thing — as simply overwrought, chaotic even. It’s no worse than the Accord, another car stuck nursing wounds from the ugly stick. Decide for yourself about the Legacy’s appeal, and drop me an email when you do.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin boasts more conventional lines and adult-friendly room, with a number of welcome changes. The doors now have window frames, yielding a more substantial thunk when you shut them. The backseat gains 4 inches of legroom, Subaru says, and it’s about as roomy as the Accord’s, which has been a benchmark for backseat comfort since its 2008 redesign.\n\nStill, I can’t shake the feeling that the interior feels low-rent. Too many areas — the wood trim, the silver-painted center controls, the italicized gauges — look trendy, chintzy almost, as if Subaru picked style over substance in a dozen small ways. (To be fair, other Cars.com staffers found the interior quality more to their liking.) The center controls feel needlessly crammed together, and major dials like volume and stereo tuning are too small to find without looking away from the road. The leather upholstery falls closer to Mazda6 territory than to Accord or Camry cowhide. Small gripes, perhaps, but the sum of them all determines whether a cabin feels like something $20,000 to $30,000 ought to get you. Relative to an Accord, Malibu or Fusion, the Legacy’s interior feels a few grand short.\n\nDrivers of various sizes should find the space adequate, thanks to long adjustment ranges for both seats. The front seats have less padding than the Fusion’s or Camry’s chairs, however, and my back grew sore over a few long interstate trips. Shorter drivers should also note that the center armrest doesn’t extend forward to accommodate their elbows, as several competitors’ armrests now do.\n\nCargo volume, at 14.7 cubic feet, is comparable to that of an Accord or Camry. If you’re looking to pack in suitcases or golf clubs, the Mazda6 and Fusion lead the pack with more than 16 cubic feet apiece.\n\nTech Features\nThe optional navigation system includes a large screen with excellent graphics and plenty of street labels, but some simple actions — canceling route guidance, for instance — require an excessive number of intermediary screens.\n\nAn MP3 jack is standard on all trims, and the navigation system adds USB/iPod integration. The iPod controls leave something to be desired: A few songs into my iPod’s classic rock playlist, I wanted to meander off into some deeper Who cuts. No dice. As Subaru later confirmed, the Legacy’s system doesn’t let you change playlists, albums or artists unless the car is stopped. I’ll agree that distracted driving should be avoided — which is why a lot of navigation systems don’t allow you to enter new destinations while you’re on the move — but locking out simple music changes is equivalent to barring radio-station changes during a road trip. I’ve never seen another system that does this. It’s nannying at its worst, and it defeats the point of having a massive song library on your iPod in the first place.\n\nThe navigation system includes a backup camera, something many family sedans now include. Just a few years ago, you were lucky to find backup cameras in luxury cars.\n\nSafety & Pricing\nThe new Legacy has yet to be tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety features for 2010 include six airbags, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes. Click here to see the full list. Active head restraints are no longer included — they were standard last year — but Subaru says the 2010 Legacy’s seats use a whiplash-mitigating design.\n\nThe base Legacy 2.5i starts at $19,995. That’s $800 less than last year, and in league with competitors’ base trims — not bad, given the Legacy’s standard all-wheel drive. Other four-cylinder trims include the 2.5i Premium and 2.5i Limited. The six-cylinder Legacy 3.6R comes in base ($24,995), Premium ($25,995) and Limited ($27,995) trims, while the turbocharged 2.5GT comes only as a Premium ($27,995) or Limited ($29,995). Premium models get a power driver’s seat, while the Limited adds a power passenger seat, leather upholstery and dual-zone automatic climate control. Heated seats, a moonroof and Harman Kardon audio are optional across most trims; the navigation system is optional only on the Limited trim level.\n\nCheck all the boxes, and a 2.5GT Limited tops out around $33,000.\n\nLegacy in the Market\nSubaru calls the 2010 Legacy a response to what its customers wanted — durability, value and performance, with a bit more cabin room. Those customers ought to be happy: The Legacy is all that, and it should continue to serve as a mildly unconventional alternative for buyers who equate Accord or Camry ownership with a voyage of the bland. Whether Subaru can go toe-to-toe with those heavy hitters, however, remains to be seen. The Legacy will find its buyers, but until Subaru irons out some usability issues and moves its cabin quality upstream, its midsize sedan will have a tough time breaking into the mainstream.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Leave it to Subaru, always the individual, always unique.\n\nNow, the all-wheel-drive champ brings out another niche vehicle for a previously unknown niche, the Sport Utility Sedan. Or as it says on the trunk of the jacked-up Legacy, an SUS.\n\nIt’s not an entirely new concept. Back in the ’70s, the late, great American Motors married a Hornet to a Jeep driveline and turned out a brief series of four-wheel-drive automobiles. It was an interesting concept, but not enough to save AMC from its creditors, and the idea went down with the ship.\n\nSubaru, the darling of Vermont winters, has made a career of all-wheel-drive cars, and now produces nothing but. The Japanese automaker struck gold in recent years with the popular Outback concept that turned a Legacy station wagon into a semblance of a rugged sport-utility vehicle.\n\nNow, there’s a less-expensive Impreza Outback as well, plus the Forester, with a body that resembles a small truck.\n\nNow comes the SUS, built for people who desire the snow-going, dirt-road-running capacities of the Outback but still want the sleeker look of a sedan. The thought of a station wagon strikes horror in many who feel perilously close to domesticity.\n\nBesides looking pretty much like a normal car, though more rough-and-tumble, the SUS will go to the same out-of-the-way places as the Outback. Plus, it performs and handles pretty much like any other sedan.\n\nThat’s the beauty of Subaru cars. You can drive them all week without the least hint of anything unusual, then on the weekend take them to the ski slopes with confidence about getting there and back.\n\nThe SUS takes that attribute and runs with it. It’s a nice driver on pavement, cornering well, accelerating briskly and feeling generally tight and well-sorted out. You’ll notice the ride height is a bit higher than “normal” cars, but it doesn’t seem to detract from the handling.\n\nThe Outback look is accomplished by adding to the regular Legacy sedan some aggressive stylistic touches, including broad and sturdy-looking bumpers, fog lights with grille covers and some big all-season tires mounted on bold modular rims. Maybe just a bit over the top, especially with the big white lettering on the tires.\n\nThe Outback Limited test car was nicely equipped, with a high level of interior trim and equipment. The exterior was stylish and well-finished enough to merit some unsolicited favorable remarks.\n\nAnother piece of Subaru’s individualistic image is its distinctive boxer engine, an “opposed” four in which the cylinders are mounted horizontally, meaning that they fire sideways, with two cylinders on either side of the crankshaft. Only one other automaker currently offers this type of engine in the United States. And that’s Porsche.\n\nThis layout creates an engine that is notably smooth while boasting a low center of gravity. The power’s OK, but fails to match the performance of all those V-6-powered sedans available at a similar price. The engine als o gets noisy under acceleration.\n\nThe all-wheel drive is electronically controlled, basically a front drive with a drive shaft to the rear wheels. This is a simple and lightweight assembly, but not as rugged as a Jeep-like four-wheel drive used in most of the trucklike sport-utility vehicles.\n\nNor is the ground clearance suitable for traversing boulder-strewn mountain trails.\n\nWe didn’t get to take this critter off the pavement, but I have driven the wagon-based Outback in the snow and on dirt roads, and it performs well. On the road, all-wheel drive provides sure-footed handling under all conditions, rain or shine.\n\nWhich doesn’t mean you should beat up on your SUS, but at least have some confidence that it’s a sturdy car that can take the heat, on or off the pavement.\n\n1999 Subaru Legacy Outback sedan\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, all-wheel drive. Base price: $25,595. Price as tested: $26,090. Engine: 2.5-liter opposed four, 165 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 162 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic.

      "expert_review": "More cars in the future will resemble the 2010 Subaru Legacy Limited, whether we like it or not.\n\nWhile this all-wheel drive sedan is fun, capable and good looking, it’s also got a CVT connected to its 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. This continuously variable transmission is going to take some getting used to.\n\nSee, CVTs defy the senses, and that’s where the trouble begins.\n\nBut there’s no doubting that they’re going to be inside future cars because they undeniably provide better gas mileage. The base Legacy with a 6-speed manual transmission and the same engine gets 19 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. But the Limited, which offers the CVT as standard, gets 23 mpg city and 31 mpg highway — those are certainly noticeable differences.\n\nSo how is a CVT different? Well, it doesn’t have any gears. It works like a bad marriage — it needs tension to run efficiently.\n\nTypical CVTs use a belt and pulley system to maintain tension between the engine and the wheels. As the engine revs, the pulleys and belts adjust to meet the driver’s demands. Whereas regular transmissions move through set gears, the CVT adjusts its pulleys and belts to avoid that lurch between gears known as shift shock. It’s truly ingenious — though not really new. Leonardo da Vinci sketched out the idea — though he was also a little ahead of his time. (NASA copied his plans for the original space shuttle.) The first patent for a CVT was filed in the late 1800s and these transmissions have been around for more than 20 years in the U.S., though in smaller numbers. Subaru was, in fact, the first carmaker to provide a CVT in America with the 1989 Subaru Justy.\n\nDriving the Legacy 2.5i Limited, I longed for that little shifting sound and feel. It’s the pause I’ve imitated all my life when making the sound of any car racing down the road, letting me catch my breath as the car verbally gains speed. Limited sporty and loaded\n\nReally, the Legacy Limited is a sporty sedan loaded with features. The exterior is sharp and clean, and the interior is comfortable and intuitive.\n\nThe high-end Limited comes packed with features. From the 10-way electric adjustable driver’s seat and 440-watt Harman / Kardon stereo system to 17-inch wheels and dual climate controls, the Legacy Limited has everything.\n\nYou can operate your phone hands free with the Bluetooth connection, change radio stations and adjust your vehicle’s cruising speed without ever taking your hands off the leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThe 170-horsepower engine provides plenty of power and the Legacy’s suspension provides a smooth ride, even if you’re trying to cut through corners fast. You can “shift” gears, too, with the paddle shifters that come with the CVT.\n\nNow I know I just provided you with a big speech about how CVTs don’t even have gears, so how why does Subaru provide paddle shifters and a manual mode with its CVT?\n\nThis is to trick you into liking CVTs.\n\nThe faux shifts are actual pause points to imitate a transmission hunting and pecking around for a gear. Subaru could have made the Legacy an 18-speed if it wanted to because it’s programming that allows the transmission to shift. The computer adjusts the engine’s rpm and causes the car to slightly lurch just like the old transmission. It’s actually quite effective at deceiving you. Using automatic confusing\n\nBut don’t be fooled. You can get on the highway and downshift all the way to second “gear” if you want and listen to the engine whine in defiance.\n\nReally, the only way to sanely drive the Legacy Limited is with the paddle shifters. If you don’t use them and leave the car in automatic mode, it’s confusing and uncomfortable.\n\nWhen you launch the vehicle, its revs tend to jump and then stay too high. Because the shift points are gone, something feels off — though the Legacy is performing exactly the way it was designed. The CVT searches for the most efficient engine speed to produce the power it needs — this is one of the reasons CVTs provide better gas mileage.\n\nWhen you launch the Legacy Limited from a stop, it tends to whine too much for too long, and when you’re slam down the gas, it tends to over rev as well. Because there are no shift points, it feels unnatural, even though it’s working just fine.\n\nThey may be different, but they are also getting better. The Legacy’s CVT works much better than most of the CVTs in cars from just a few years ago. And in some vehicles, such as gas-electric hybrids, they feel very “normal.”\n\nSo CVTs may still be a 100 year-old work in progress, but, then again, so is the internal combustion engine, as well as the automobile in general.\n\nDo I like the CVT? Not really. But I can get used to it and in the coming years, people will just get used to it. At least until all of the cars become purely electric — those cars have no transmission at all.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "If there is such a thing as a sleeper on the American automotive market, it is the Legacy sedan from Subaru of America.\n\nSubaru, whose parent shares the Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. plant near Lafayette, Ind., offers in the Legacy an automobile that utilizes state-of-the-art technology and adds a few touches of its own.\n\nPrinciple among these is Subaru’s opposed-4 and opposed-6 engine configuration. More commonly known as a flat-4 or flat-6 in the automotive trade, the concept is not in universal use among the world’s automobile manufacturers.\n\nAutomakers may have overlooked a good thing. The opposed-cylinder layout offers advantages like an inherent balance of an engine’s reciprocating componentry, and a low frontal profile.\n\nSubaru’s Legacy goes further by incorporating advanced four-wheel suspension, manual or automatic transmission systems, optional comfort and convenience systems, and interior styling themes that make a midrange-priced four-door look like a more-expensive car.\n\nThe Legacy runs from standard to upscale, with a moderately equipped L model representing the broad range of the series. It has a moderate base price, and you can go from their in equipping the compact.\n\nThe Legacy L that Rick Shewmake, general sales manager of Speedway Volkswagen-Subaru, provided for a test car drove and acted like a fairly powerful midsized car. Thanks to a 16-valve flat-4 that put out 130-horsepower, the sedan exhibited quite acceptable performance for a car this size.\n\nThe engine in this machine activated the four valves per cylinder via a single-overhead cam on each bank rather than by the traditional dual-overhead cams. It leveled off momentarily around 30 to 33 mph on full throttle off-the-line runs, but then came on with a good power surge and gave the car excellent acceleration.\n\nThe ease of the ride for a rather light sedan will catch everybody’s attention. The ride almost floats, but without body wallow on fast turns. Subaru’s suspension engineers have found a good balance between spring rates and stability.\n\nLikewise, engineering has done a respectable job on interior room, considering it was dealing with 177.6 inches of overall length. The sedan will carry five people, but four is a more feasible number for comfort.\n\nAmoung the test car’s options that contributed to driving pleasure were air conditioning, automatic transmission and cruise control. Obviously, they push up the cost, but the satisfaction remains long after the price is forgotten.\n\nA couple of individual touches that other mass producers could follow was a driver’s side window that automatically went up as well as down and a manually oriented memory tilt wheel that automatically returned to its preset position.\n\nIn all, the features made the L an upscale car without resorting to upscale prices. That should continue to enhance its market position.\n\n1991 Subaru Legacy LBase price: $12,924.As tested: $15,896.Type: Front-engine, front-drive, f ive-passenger compact sedan.Engine: 2.2-liter, 16-valve, fuel-injected, four-cylinder.Mileage: 21 mpg city, 28 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 9.6 seconds.Length: 177.6 inches.Wheelbase: 101.6 inches.Curb weight: 2,830 pounds.Options: Air conditioning, automatic transmission, power windows/locks, 80 Watt audio/w graphic equalizer, cruise control, special paint.Area dealers: Speedway, Tom Wood.",
