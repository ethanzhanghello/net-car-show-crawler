      "expert_review": "Minor updates for the 2018 Subaru Outback make an already good thing better. Subtle styling tweaks — like more angular headlights and a slightly larger grille — maintain the Outback’s clean, unfussy design, while an updated multimedia system and retuned transmission improve usability and drivability. Compare the 2017 and 2018 models here.\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s most direct competitor — spiritually if not in size — is the VW Golf Alltrack, another tall wagon with AWD. The Outback also competes against more traditional mid-size SUVs like the Ford Edge and Jeep Cherokee. Compare them here.\n\nBoring? Not So Fast\n\nWhile the Outback’s exterior styling doesn’t raise eyebrows, it stands out among the throngs of SUVs in grocery store parking lots and school drop-off lanes in that it’s not an SUV — or at least, not exactly. Its tall-wagon looks set it apart from the pack, though with each redesign it takes on more of the bloated stance of an SUV.\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s cabin has always had a utilitarian, serviceable look to it, but there’s a surprise inside for 2018. Interior design is classier across the lineup, and materials quality is better overall. Subaru even added a dose of luxury in higher trim levels, with high-quality materials highlighted by padded plastic where it counts, plus comfy leather seats with contrast stitching and faux (but believable) low-gloss wood paneling on the door sills and dash. New stitching on the upper dash of top trim levels also adds some pizzazz. These small pops of unexpected luxury impress in the thoughtfully designed cabin.\n\nThe controls got tweaked, too. A standard 6.5-inch touchscreen replaces last year’s smaller unit, and an 8-inch touchscreen is optional. The graphics are crisp and modern, the menus straightforward and easy to use. Even better are the handy tuning and volume knobs. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone infotainment compatibility are new this year, and they’re standard. Lastly, the climate controls have been relocated directly under the multimedia screen for a more cohesive look.\n\nSlow? Not So\n\nMy time in Subarus past was marked by irritation and aggravation; the brand’s heavy use of continuously variable automatic transmissions has helped fuel economy but hurt responsiveness and quietness. The 2018 Outback, however, is both responsive and quiet.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t call it quick, the Subaru Outback isn’t slow, either. A 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat four-cylinder is standard, while a 256-hp, 3.6-liter six-cylinder is optional. Both engines work through a CVT and standard all-wheel drive. Subaru says it retuned the Outback’s steering, brakes and shock absorbers to improve drivability, and I believe it. The ride is composed, with good bump absorption and predictable, comfortable maneuverability. Steering is nicely weighted, direct and natural.\n\nSubaru retuned the CVT for a smoother response and, again, the changes made an impact. I found the four-cylinder adequate off the line and the transmission convincingly natural, with artificial stepped gears that make it feel more like a conventional automatic and cut down on the powertrain’s former albatross: a loud, continuous droning noise.\n\nQuietness is improved in other areas, as well: Reshaped mirrors, thicker wheel-well panels and new sound-insulating glass help cut cabin noise. The result is pleasant overall, both on the highway and around town.\n\nThe Subaru Outback leads competitors in fuel economy. Four-cylinder versions are EPA-rated at 25/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s better than the base version of the Golf Alltrack, at 22/30/25 mpg, as well as the AWD four-cylinder Edge (20/27/23 mpg) and AWD Cherokee (21/28/23).\n\nSkilled With Kids … and Mud\n\nFor families with one or two children, the Outback is plenty roomy. Alas, I have three, yet the Outback accommodated us with minimal squeezing. Three child-safety seats do not fit comfortably, but in a pinch, the Outback can make it work. My 3-year-old twins’ convertible car seats went in with ease thanks to exposed lower Latch anchors and ample legroom. There was just enough space left over in the middle for my second-grader’s compact, inflatable booster. We wouldn’t road trip like this, but it worked for a weekend of errands. Click here for the full Car Seat Check.\n\nThe front and rear seats are comfortable, and there’s plenty of headroom and legroom in both. By the numbers, the Outback offers a smidge more rear headroom than the Cherokee and Alltrack, but a bit less than the Edge. For rear legroom, it offers a bit less than the Cherokee and Edge, but more than the Alltrack. Backseat passengers are treated to a couple of perks: The seatback reclines for added comfort, and there are two USB ports for charging mobile devices. (There are two more up front.)\n\nSomeday, my house, car and [insert thing here] will be clean. That day will not come this decade, but the Outback can handle it. After an incident involving mud, a pair of toddlers and several pumpkins, I developed a fondness for the Outback’s cargo area. Its wide opening makes loading easy, and the storage area is both deep and a snap to clean thanks to a removable heavy-duty mat. Folding the seats for more storage is also seamless, with cargo-area handles that drop the seats with one pull.\n\nBy the numbers, the Outback is mid-pack in terms of cargo volume. Seats up, there’s 35.5 cubic feet of space — a bit less than the Edge but more than the Alltrack and Cherokee. Seats down, there’s 73.3 cubic feet, roughly tying the Edge and besting the Cherokee and Alltrack.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Subaru Outback earned top crash-test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It was also one of the few vehicles to pass IIHS’ new, tough front passenger-side small overlap crash test.\n\nA backup camera is standard across all trims and — new for 2018 — the guidelines that display on the screen move in sync with the steering to provide more accurate vehicle positioning. Subaru’s EyeSight suite of safety systems is optional on all but the base model; it includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping departure warning with steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Other safety options include a blind spot warning system, automatic reverse braking and adaptive headlights with automatic high beams.\n\nValue\n\nThe Subaru Outback appeals for its differentness, versatility and value. It starts at $26,810 (all prices include destination), $290 more than the 2017 Outback and around the same as the VW Alltrack ($26,670) and Cherokee ($26,990). However, it’s less than the base AWD version of the Edge ($31,840).\n\nThis anti-SUV can be a lot of things depending on what you need. It offers SUV-like room and capability with un-SUV looks, plus a well-appointed interior that could easily double as a comfy hideout from camping in the rain.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Where many manufacturers have wavered with the coming and going of wagons in and out of their lineups, Subaru has stood firm with its iconic all-wheel-drive wagon, the Outback.\n\nThe 2014 Subaru Outback may not woo you with the most innovative features or dazzling luxury finishes, but this tried-and-true wagon will carry you and your family dutifully through any condition you can throw at it.\n\nThe Subaru Outback is not just another test car for me; it’s a trip down memory lane. I used to own an Outback and brought both my daughters home from the hospital in it. I had chosen the Outback for its safe feel, low center of gravity and ability to handle mixed Rocky Mountain weather conditions without batting an eye, but its massive hump in the center of the backseat back then made it impossible to install a third child-safety seat, which locked me out of carpooling when my girls started school. This frustration birthed my career quest for the quintessential mom-mobile a decade ago.\n\nI’m happy to announce that in the past ten years, I’ve eliminated all chunky, ribbed turtleneck sweaters from my wardrobe, and Subaru has done away with the massive center hump in the backseat. Win-win.\n\nThe 2014 Outback comes in four styles, including the 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, 2.5i Limited and a 3.6R Limited (which is the one I drove). See them all side by side here.\n\nThe Subaru Outback has some updates for the 2014 model year, including a revised continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), options for Premium and Limited models that include EyeSight driver assistance technology, an optional backup camera, and Aha internet radio smartphone integration packaged with the optional navigation system. There’s an optional alloy wheel package on the 2.5i model. Check out 2014 and 2013 versions side by side here.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a solid family-hauling wagon but Subaru just doesn’t fit the bill for you, you may also want to consider the Honda Crosstour and Toyota Venza. See them compared with the Outback here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2014 Outback fit right in here in Colorado. You see them in the city, freshly waxed and reflecting the skyline; in the burbs, carrying a load of school kids; and in the mountains, caked with ice and snow. It presents a nice mix of functional SUV qualities (8.7 inches of ground clearance and a large and usable cargo space) with a fairly refined carlike look that you wouldn’t be embarrassed to park with a valet.\n\nDespite its SUV body-type and ground clearance, somehow the Outback still provides a manageable step-in height, making it easy for kids and grandparents alike to step in without having to engage their rock-climbing skills. However, the low car-like roofline does require a slight duck to get in without hitting your head.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Outback 3.6R Limited I drove features a five-speed automatic transmission along with the standard all-wheel drive. I had plenty of power both around town and getting up to speed quickly on the highway.\n\nI was a little surprised by the bounciness of the Outback over even small bumps on the highway; rather than damping them out immediately, the Outback exhibited a noticeable recovery bounce.\n\nCornering in the Outback — whether at speed on highway off-ramps or on the slow, twisty roads on the way to my girls’ school — felt confident and solidly planted. I was happy to see that the main thing that attracted me to the Outback for my own family so many years ago has most certainty endured.\n\nThe Outback 3.6R Limited sports a 256-horsepower, 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined. For a vast improvement in fuel consumption — though at the cost of acceleration — you can opt into any of the 2.5i models with their 173-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder and CVT. These models get an EPA-estimated 24/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined. A six-speed manual-shift transmission, available on base and Premium trim levels, gets an estimated 22/29/24 mpg.\n\nInterior\nMy family and I were pleasantly surprised by how spacious and roomy the Outback felt, even with all five of us packed in. My girls (a modern mix including my 9-year-old stepdaughter along with my “babies,” who are now 11 and 13), had plenty of backseat legroom (37.8 inches). This is a tad more than the Honda Crosstour’s 37.4 inches of rear legroom, but if you really want to stretch out, the Venza has the most legroom, with 39.1 inches. The Venza also wins in terms of hip room for those who regularly pack three kids in or need to squeeze in multiple child-safety seats.\n\nThe rear seat’s bottom cushion is virtually flat, making the center seat quite a usable position for a child or car seat. However, the center rear seat belt extends down from the roofline and tends to cut high and uncomfortably across a child’s neck, not to mention the slight rear visibility distraction this causes. Why not just install the seat belt into the seatback, Subaru?\n\nKids in the back can stay comfortably cool or warm with their own air vents at the back of the center console. The center armrest in the backseat folds down to provide two cupholders, and both the front and rear doors have additional storage pockets.\n\nThe interior of my Subaru Outback was equipped with the standard finishes, which looked and felt a little cheap for my taste. I noticed some scratches already appearing on the faux brushed-aluminum trim pieces adorning the center control panel. An optional Special Appearance Package is available for the more discriminating consumer and includes saddle brown leather-trimmed seats (which would hopefully hide more dirt, as the black on my test car seemed to illuminate every speck) and a matte wood-grain-patterned interior trim finish.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMy test car did not come with the optional navigation system and its corresponding 7-inch touch-screen display. The standard 4.3-inch screen in my tester seemed antiquated. It was hard to navigate through menus, and the backup camera’s tiny image on this screen felt like a mean joke. Is that a child behind my neighbor’s garden gnome?\n\nWhile both the front seats were heated in my test car (standard on all but the base trim), the amount of heat they produced was on the wimpy side. My husband commented that if he’d purchased this car, he’d return it solely for the fact that the seats didn’t get hot enough to actually warm his backside. That might be a bit of an overreaction, but you get the idea.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s a load of cargo space in the Outback that’s perfect for families who evolve from hauling double strollers to hockey gear or massive dance competition rolling garment bags with pop-up closet racks. (Yep — they exist. Save me!)\n\nThe rear seats split 65/35 and fold flat easily for a maximum cargo volume of 71.3 cubic feet. The Outback is the winner of the bunch, with the Venza just behind at 70.2 cubic feet and the Crosstour offering just 51.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo capacity.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Subaru Outback is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus — the organization’s highest honor. It received the highest rating of good in the moderate overlap frontal crash test, as well as the side, roof-strength and head-restraints-and-seats tests. It received a slightly lower rating of acceptable in the small overlap front test, but only two models in the Midsize Moderately Priced Cars category, the Honda Accord sedan and Chevy Malibu, earned the good rating in this test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also performed crash tests on the Outback, which earned an overall score of five out of five stars.\n\nFamilies installing child-safety seats with the Outback’s Latch system will be pleased with access to the lower anchors. They’re concealed within covered slits in the seat bight, yet are fairly easy to access without incurring bodily injury. Older children in booster seats will be happy with the seat belt buckles in the two outboard seating positions. They’re on solid bases, making them easy for children with small hands and developing fine motor skills to buckle on their own.\n\nThe center seating position is a different story. There’s that shoulder belt extending down from the roofline, and the center seat belt buckle receptor is on a flimsy base that’s harder to buckle. The optional EyeSight system was not included on my test car, so I didn’t have an opportunity to try it out myself, but that option package includes additional safety features such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and pre-collision braking with pedestrian detection. IIHS rates these features superior, making the Outback and Subaru Legacy the only models in the class rated so highly in this area. We only wish these active-safety features weren’t tied to non-safety features in expensive option packages. Safety features should be a la carte.\n\nSee all the Subaru Outback’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Subaru Outback is one of those vehicles that will continue to have a loyal cult following, especially as each version improves a little bit. Sure, when you boil it down it might be falling behind other progressive brands in terms of the speed of evolution of interior niceties and modern electronic conveniences, but the Outback remains the strong, silent type that will get you where you’re going come rain, snow or sun — without the brash and overly brute, aggressive qualities of a typical SUV.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Minor updates for the 2018 Subaru Outback make an already good thing better. Subtle styling tweaks — like more angular headlights and a slightly larger grille — maintain the Outback’s clean, unfussy design, while an updated multimedia system and retuned transmission improve usability and drivability. Compare the 2017 and 2018 models here.\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s most direct competitor — spiritually if not in size — is the VW Golf Alltrack, another tall wagon with AWD. The Outback also competes against more traditional mid-size SUVs like the Ford Edge and Jeep Cherokee. Compare them here.\n\nBoring? Not So Fast\n\nWhile the Outback’s exterior styling doesn’t raise eyebrows, it stands out among the throngs of SUVs in grocery store parking lots and school drop-off lanes in that it’s not an SUV — or at least, not exactly. Its tall-wagon looks set it apart from the pack, though with each redesign it takes on more of the bloated stance of an SUV.\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s cabin has always had a utilitarian, serviceable look to it, but there’s a surprise inside for 2018. Interior design is classier across the lineup, and materials quality is better overall. Subaru even added a dose of luxury in higher trim levels, with high-quality materials highlighted by padded plastic where it counts, plus comfy leather seats with contrast stitching and faux (but believable) low-gloss wood paneling on the door sills and dash. New stitching on the upper dash of top trim levels also adds some pizzazz. These small pops of unexpected luxury impress in the thoughtfully designed cabin.\n\nThe controls got tweaked, too. A standard 6.5-inch touchscreen replaces last year’s smaller unit, and an 8-inch touchscreen is optional. The graphics are crisp and modern, the menus straightforward and easy to use. Even better are the handy tuning and volume knobs. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone infotainment compatibility are new this year, and they’re standard. Lastly, the climate controls have been relocated directly under the multimedia screen for a more cohesive look.\n\nSlow? Not So\n\nMy time in Subarus past was marked by irritation and aggravation; the brand’s heavy use of continuously variable automatic transmissions has helped fuel economy but hurt responsiveness and quietness. The 2018 Outback, however, is both responsive and quiet.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t call it quick, the Subaru Outback isn’t slow, either. A 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat four-cylinder is standard, while a 256-hp, 3.6-liter six-cylinder is optional. Both engines work through a CVT and standard all-wheel drive. Subaru says it retuned the Outback’s steering, brakes and shock absorbers to improve drivability, and I believe it. The ride is composed, with good bump absorption and predictable, comfortable maneuverability. Steering is nicely weighted, direct and natural.\n\nSubaru retuned the CVT for a smoother response and, again, the changes made an impact. I found the four-cylinder adequate off the line and the transmission convincingly natural, with artificial stepped gears that make it feel more like a conventional automatic and cut down on the powertrain’s former albatross: a loud, continuous droning noise.\n\nQuietness is improved in other areas, as well: Reshaped mirrors, thicker wheel-well panels and new sound-insulating glass help cut cabin noise. The result is pleasant overall, both on the highway and around town.\n\nThe Subaru Outback leads competitors in fuel economy. Four-cylinder versions are EPA-rated at 25/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s better than the base version of the Golf Alltrack, at 22/30/25 mpg, as well as the AWD four-cylinder Edge (20/27/23 mpg) and AWD Cherokee (21/28/23).\n\nSkilled With Kids … and Mud\n\nFor families with one or two children, the Outback is plenty roomy. Alas, I have three, yet the Outback accommodated us with minimal squeezing. Three child-safety seats do not fit comfortably, but in a pinch, the Outback can make it work. My 3-year-old twins’ convertible car seats went in with ease thanks to exposed lower Latch anchors and ample legroom. There was just enough space left over in the middle for my second-grader’s compact, inflatable booster. We wouldn’t road trip like this, but it worked for a weekend of errands. Click here for the full Car Seat Check.\n\nThe front and rear seats are comfortable, and there’s plenty of headroom and legroom in both. By the numbers, the Outback offers a smidge more rear headroom than the Cherokee and Alltrack, but a bit less than the Edge. For rear legroom, it offers a bit less than the Cherokee and Edge, but more than the Alltrack. Backseat passengers are treated to a couple of perks: The seatback reclines for added comfort, and there are two USB ports for charging mobile devices. (There are two more up front.)\n\nSomeday, my house, car and [insert thing here] will be clean. That day will not come this decade, but the Outback can handle it. After an incident involving mud, a pair of toddlers and several pumpkins, I developed a fondness for the Outback’s cargo area. Its wide opening makes loading easy, and the storage area is both deep and a snap to clean thanks to a removable heavy-duty mat. Folding the seats for more storage is also seamless, with cargo-area handles that drop the seats with one pull.\n\nBy the numbers, the Outback is mid-pack in terms of cargo volume. Seats up, there’s 35.5 cubic feet of space — a bit less than the Edge but more than the Alltrack and Cherokee. Seats down, there’s 73.3 cubic feet, roughly tying the Edge and besting the Cherokee and Alltrack.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Subaru Outback earned top crash-test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It was also one of the few vehicles to pass IIHS’ new, tough front passenger-side small overlap crash test.\n\nA backup camera is standard across all trims and — new for 2018 — the guidelines that display on the screen move in sync with the steering to provide more accurate vehicle positioning. Subaru’s EyeSight suite of safety systems is optional on all but the base model; it includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping departure warning with steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Other safety options include a blind spot warning system, automatic reverse braking and adaptive headlights with automatic high beams.\n\nValue\n\nThe Subaru Outback appeals for its differentness, versatility and value. It starts at $26,810 (all prices include destination), $290 more than the 2017 Outback and around the same as the VW Alltrack ($26,670) and Cherokee ($26,990). However, it’s less than the base AWD version of the Edge ($31,840).\n\nThis anti-SUV can be a lot of things depending on what you need. It offers SUV-like room and capability with un-SUV looks, plus a well-appointed interior that could easily double as a comfy hideout from camping in the rain.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Whether you consider the 2017 Subaru Outback a wagon or a crossover SUV, it’s a home run for families and well-rounded enough to appeal to a large crowd.\n\nVersus the competition: Though the Outback doesn’t have the sheer capabilities and size of a traditional midsize SUV, there’s enough SUV flavor there to satisfy more than just loyal Subaru owners.\n\nFor 2017, the Subaru Outback adds a new Touring trim level that gives an extra bit of luxuriousness to the top of the four-cylinder (2.5i) and six-cylinder (3.6R) trim ranges. Outback trims now include the base 2.5i trim, plus 2.5i Premium, 2.5i Limited, 2.5i Touring, 3.6R Limited and 3.6R Touring. Compare the 2016 Outback with the 2017 here. Otherwise, this is the same great Outback that was redesigned for 2015, transforming the formerly quirky and polarizing wagon into a more mainstream vehicle with good looks, a nice driving experience and a loaded suite of safety features.\n\nFor this review, I drove a 3.6R Limited, which we tested alongside a crop of two-row SUVs for Cars.com’s $45,000 Midsize SUV Challenge, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Kia Sorento and Ford Edge.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Subaru Outback’s 8.7 inches of ground clearance is more than many midsize SUVs and contributes to the Outback looking like a wagon with a lifted suspension, which isn’t a bad look. For 2015, the Outback streamlined its formerly awkward, polarizing appearance. Little has changed for 2017 except for the new Touring trim, which adds a dark gray grille, 18-inch wheels with dark gray accents, and silver-painted roof rails.\nHow It Drives\nThe optional 3.6-liter flat-6 cylinder is an interesting engine choice. On one hand, the six is smoother and quieter than the four-cylinder. On the other hand, its 256 horsepower isn’t managed very well by the continuously variable automatic transmission. You really have to be dedicated with the accelerator pedal to reap the benefits of the six’s extra 81 hp. Acceleration is sluggish at lower engine speeds, and power doesn’t come on strong until roughly 5,000 rpm. The 3.6-liter really starts cookin’ at high engine speeds, where the Outback starts to cover ground quickly.\n\nThe CVT is clearly an efficiency choice; its conservative tuning keeps engine speed low and fuel economy high. In our fuel economy test of five SUVs, the Subaru Outback came in second only to the front-wheel-drive Ford Edge and its turbocharged four-cylinder. All Outbacks are all-wheel drive, which typically sucks more fuel than front-wheel drive, and the one we tested was a six-cylinder, as well.\n\nTowing capacity for both engines is 2,700 pounds, which puts it in a competitive spot for compact and some midsize SUVs. If you need to tow more, there are beefier towing machines out there. The Edge and Santa Fe Sport can tow as much as 3,500 pounds when properly equipped, and the V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee can tow up to 6,200 pounds.\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s ride has a medium firmness that doesn’t float over roads but was still wholly comfortable and livable on the rough roads of Chicago. Maneuverability is more akin to a sedan than an SUV, with a tight turning radius and nimble nature around town. I observed not-too-subtle tire noise at highway speeds, but overall wind noise was in check. The Outback is inoffensive and pleasant to drive around town.\nInterior\nThe Outback’s high ground clearance oddly doesn’t harm accessibility; it’s easy enough to get into the front and backseat. The front seating position is taller than a typical sedan’s, but you don’t get the high-off-the-ground feeling of an SUV, like in a Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Edge. Outward visibility is, however, exceptional, with small pillars, tall glass and nearly unobstructed views from the driver’s seat. Just having a great view of the road goes a long way toward making the Outback comfortable to drive.\n\nSeating comfort is about average, with medium-firmness cushioning and limited adjustability. The front passenger seat doesn’t have height adjustment, and there’s no ventilated seating, like competitors offer. Backseat comfort also comes up short, with a large center floor hump that takes up legroom and a low bottom cushion angled flat enough that my thighs didn’t rest comfortably on it (I’m 6 feet tall).\n\nThe Outback’s interior quality can go toe to toe with any midsize SUV except the Murano, which is in a class above its competitors. The Subaru Outback’s interior has a classy, understated design. I wouldn’t call it luxurious, but it has higher-end qualities without being flashy. The matte imitation wood trim contrasted well with the light leather and silver trim on our test car.\n\nLess classy was the steering wheel, which was overcrowded with buttons for the Outback’s optional adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning, plus sound controls, voice commands, trip information, and mute and back buttons. Touring trims add a heated steering wheel button.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nSubaru won’t debut Apple CarPlay and Android Auto until later this year, on the redesigned 2017 Subaru Impreza, so the Outback doesn’t have that desirable smartphone integration at the moment. That’s too bad, because the rest of the multimedia system is well-done, with pinch-zoom functionality for navigation and mechanical dials for volume and tuning. The “capacitive” touch-sensitive buttons are reasonably easy to use for what they are.\n\nOur test car had an optional 7-inch touch-screen with two USB ports and a navigation system, including three years of map updates and traffic information. Neither of those USB ports is in the back, however, and there are no power outlets back there, either, so kids with devices are out of luck when it’s time to juice up the tablet. This is a notable omission considering how many competing SUVs offer either USB charge ports or household AC power outlets in the backseat, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee (rear USB and AC outlet), Nissan Murano (rear USB outlet), Kia Sorento (rear USB and AC outlet) and Ford Edge (rear AC outlet).\n\nA 12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo is included on the Limited trim, but it’s nothing to write home about. Luckily you don’t have to pay extra for it; if you did I’d strongly advise against it. Sound quality when playing high-quality music sources was dull and lifeless despite the number of speakers and the system’s 576 watts.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Outback’s cargo space compares favorably to a typical midsize SUV like the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport or Ford Edge. The cargo opening is wide and tall, and there’s plenty of room behind the backseat: 35.5 cubic feet. There’s 73.3 cubic feet of cargo space with the backseat folded, though the wheel wells seem to intrude more than in other SUVs, narrowing the cargo space. The Limited trim I tested included a power liftgate with adjustable height, a feature that’s common in SUVs but not found in many non-luxury wagons.\nSafety\nThe new Subaru Outback has nearly flawless crashworthiness ratings. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ranks it a Top Safety Pick Plus — its highest accolade — and the Outback’s optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking earned the highest rating in IIHS’ precollision system testing. See the Outback’s IIHS results, as well as those for the entire midsize car class (that’s where IIHS classifies the Outback).\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Outback five out of five stars in its overall crash ratings, and four out of five stars in rollover ratings (see the results).\n\nThe Subaru Outback’s available pre-collision system with automatic braking, EyeSight, comes in an option package on Limited trims, along with navigation, for $1,595. The package also includes adaptive cruise control plus lane departure warning and assist. EyeSight works by using two cameras mounted high on the windshield to monitor vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles and traffic lanes ahead of the vehicle; it can even detect brake lights. EyeSight can brake to a stop autonomously if a potential collision is detected, so long as the speed differential between the Outback and the other vehicle or object is less than 30 mph. Also included with EyeSight is reverse automatic braking that can detect a collision when reversing and apply the brakes. See a list of standard safety features here.\n\nBlind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on Limited models, giving the Outback a comprehensive suite of safety features. The active systems work well, alerting the driver to obstacles without too many false or annoying alarms. The adaptive cruise control performs exceptionally well given it relies on cameras, not radar, with smooth acceleration and braking. While the naming is the same on other Subarus, performance isn’t and EyeSight on the 2016 Subaru Impreza didn’t perform nearly as smoothly as on the Outback in our testing. Few adaptive cruise control systems outside the luxury segment work as seamlessly as the Outback’s.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Subaru Outback Limited pegs the value-meter when you consider its safety features, fuel economy and cargo room at our as-tested price of $37,465 with the 3.6-liter six-cylinder and EyeSight. In Cars.com’s $45,000 Midsize SUV Challenge, the Outback was a competitive body type and came in $3,000 less than the next cheapest competitor.\n\nWhat do you lose? You’ll miss out on a few creature comforts and a bigger backseat. If you can live with that, the Outback can do just about everything else a traditional midsize SUV can — for a steal.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "It’s rare that we can point to a new, redesigned automobile and say, “It fixed everything we had an issue with.” But here we are, with the new 2026 Subaru Outback and Outback Wilderness. Subaru went through its wagon-turned-SUV thing and fixed just about everything we found fault with, from the generic styling to the terrible vertical multimedia system to the touch-sensitive climate control buttons. All of it has been redone in a thoroughly modern, fully competitive manner, transforming the popular Outback from yet another mild refresh meant to appease legions of loyal prior Outback owners to a new car that just might attract a lot of new buyers.\n\nRelated: More 2025 New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nIt’s Boxy, But It’s Good\n\nTo steal a line from the infamous advertising satire movie “Crazy People,” which was originally meant to be an ad line for Volvos, the Outback’s new styling is a clear departure from the old soap-bar wagon aesthetic. But only to a point; when we saw the new boxy cabin styling and 2-inch taller roofline in spy shots, we worried that it was going to be more Forester SUV than Legacy wagon, but that turned out not to be the case at all. Yes, there is a much more formal roofline and greenhouse look to the Outback than it’s ever had, but it still maintains its wagon proportions far more than a Forester does. That boost to the roofline height is noticeable inside, too, with plenty of headroom for passengers, even with a moonroof.\n\nSubaru also toned down some of the Outback’s weirder elements, as the automaker’s styling of late has been getting to be a lot. The latest Forester is kind of a mess, and anything with a Wilderness badge on it comes with black plastic cladding in shapes that don’t seem to make much cohesive sense. The 2026 Outback takes a step back from that oddness, with cleaner, better proportioned trim over the wheel wells, a less busy front end, a smooth full-width taillight in the rear, and an overall look that makes us think someone finally busted down the door to Subaru’s car design studios and said, “Enough already!” The Wilderness does kick things up a notch with a black plastic grille, foglights and beefier cladding, but that’s not too out of place for more off-road-capable Wilderness models.\n\nHow Has the Outback’s Interior Improved?\n\nThe previous Outback’s cheapish interior with the ancient gauges, terrible vertical touchscreen and integrated touch-sensitive buttons for the climate controls was another one of our gripes, and those complaints have also been completely addressed. The 2026 Outback’s new interior is fantastic and a total rethink of the old Subaru look, and all of the interior bits have been upgraded over the old model.\n\nThe digital gauge cluster is fresh, modern and far more configurable than the old analog gauges. Subaru also recognizes that switching frequently used systems to touchscreen controls was the wrong thing to do (it only took them six years to figure it out), and it has rectified this with large, easy-to-use hard buttons for the climate controls and other frequently used functions. The seating position is excellent, too, and just high enough to give a commanding view out, but still low enough that it feels like you’re in a wagon rather than an SUV.\n\nThe Outback’s new multimedia screen is a revelation. Subaru has gone from an old, cranky, unloved Linux-based multimedia software to the fully modern Google Android Automotive-based operating system. And while the Google system may not be flawless in any application in which we’ve tested it, it’s a damn sight better than what Subaru had been using. It looks similar to Toyota’s latest multimedia system, but it’s better; the Subaru system offers a home screen, is far more configurable and operates with lightning speed, even in the early prototype model I sat in.\n\nI Can’t Find Anything I Don’t Like\n\nThe 2026 Outback’s cargo area is bigger by 2 cubic feet, according to Subaru’s measurements, and the roof rack is sturdier and easier to use. The Wilderness variant also gets electronically controlled off-road-tuned shock absorbers for what Subaru says is an astonishingly smooth ride in the dirt. What didn’t get much of a change is the powertrain; both engines make roughly the same power as before, meaning you’ll want to opt for the more powerful turbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four-cylinder for proper driving dynamics. The only thing really missing is a hybrid version, and I’d be surprised if one doesn’t show up sometime during this seventh-generation model’s run.\n\nSubaru has transformed the cult classic that a lot of today’s young buyers grew up with into a stylish, fully modern family truckster that has genuine appeal. It has managed to create something that should still appeal to the wagon-loving Subaristi who have kept the Outback going for 30 years now, as well as to people who hadn’t previously considered an Outback because it didn’t look enough like an SUV. All I know is that they’re going to sell like crazy. Better get your order in soon as Subaru opens the books. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Subaru Outback Review: An Oldie but Very, Very Goodie\n2025 Subaru Legacy, Outback Mostly Unchanged; Priced From $26,040 and $30,290\nHow Much Is the New 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid?\n2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid Up Close: More of a Good Thing\nShop for a 2025 Subaru Outback Near You\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Subaru Outback? \n\nThe 2024 Subaru Outback is a compelling choice for car shoppers who want SUV levels of space in something that’s a bit more carlike and manageable to drive. With seating for five and an exceptionally roomy cargo area, the Outback is a highly versatile mid-size wagon. The base powertrain is a 182-horsepower four-cylinder engine paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission; a 260-hp turbo four is optional, and it delivers notably stronger passing power. All-wheel drive is standard with either engine.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Subaru Outback? \n\nSubaru’s Eyesight driver-assist technology is now standard on all trims, and it also now includes automatic emergency steering at speeds below 50 mph on trims that feature blind spot warning with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert. Wilderness trims get a revised front end with standard LED foglights, while Wilderness, Onyx Edition and Onyx Edition XT trims now come standard with a heated steering wheel. Onyx Edition trims also get a power moonroof and reverse automatic braking.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Subaru Outback Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual 7-inch touchscreens\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic climate control\nKeyless entry\nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control \nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n11.6-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nLeather seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nHeated front seats\nHeated rear seats\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2024 Subaru Outback? \n\nRoomy and relaxing to drive, the Subaru Outback is an excellent alternative to both a mid-size sedan and a compact SUV. Standard AWD is a key selling point, though the Outback should also be credited for its strong roster of safety and tech features. The base engine is good on gas, but it can drone under hard acceleration. The turbo four-cylinder in upper trims delivers better performance, and it nudges maximum towing capacity to 3,500 pounds. With its extra ground clearance, underbody skid plates and off-road tires, the Wilderness trim gives the Outback even more outdoorsy appeal and all-terrain capability.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though it’s due to be redesigned in the near future, the 2025 Subaru Outback Touring XT is one of the most comfortable and refined SUVs in its class.\n\nVersus the competition: While technically an SUV, the Subaru Outback presents and drives like a lifted wagon — something that cannot be said of the Toyota Highlander or Honda Passport. \n\nSurprises are one of the best parts of my job, and what a tasty little snack it is when my expectations are aggressively exceeded. This time, it was a loaded 2025 Subaru Outback Touring XT that snuck up and wowed me when I wasn’t looking. Much of that was because of my expectations; the 2025 Outback is part of this vehicle’s sixth generation, and it’s hardly fresh, having been with us since the 2020 model year. \n\nRelated: Buy This, Not That: 2025 Subaru Outback or 2025 Toyota Crown Signia?\n\n2025 Subaru Outback Touring XT, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI’ve driven this generation of the Outback several times — in controlled environments, off-road settings and multi-car comparisons — over the past five model years. I’ve always distantly liked it as a standard workaday family hustler, but it never stuck in my mind. So when I took a 2025 Outback Touring XT on a Monday blast from Los Angeles to San Diego, then on to Scottsdale, Ariz., for the remainder of the week, I expected it to be just a step above whatever I could have nabbed from a rental lot.\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Outback Touring XT Trim?\n\nInstead, I learned what a lovely, lovely car the Touring XT is. This trim is the tippy-top of the Outback mountain, featuring the line’s more powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine and most supple interior. Nappa leather upholstery is standard, in either a Slate Black or rich Java Brown, as mine was. The front seats are surprisingly cushy and both heated and ventilated, complemented by a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Outback is officially an SUV, but its seating position and long roof say “wagon” — even if most Outbacks have a half-inch more ground clearance than a rear-wheel-drive 2025 Ford F-150 pickup. Most modern Subarus have a more buttery ride quality than the Touring XT’s $44,330 tag or vehicle type suggest — without sacrificing above-average body control and handling — and that holds true for the Touring XT.\n\n2025 Subaru Outback Touring XT, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat Engine Is in the 2025 Outback Touring XT?\n\nIt’s punchy, too. The Touring XT’s heart is Subaru’s turbocharged 2.4-liter flat four-cylinder, which is good for 260 horsepower and 277 pounds-feet of torque, routed through a continuously variable automatic transmission and the automaker’s signature “symmetrical” all-wheel-drive system. It’s hardly a powerhouse, but while it feels a bit strained in Subaru’s larger Ascent three-row SUV, this engine feels quite suited to the Outback; it had plenty of punch for my rather cheeky trans-Sonoran pace.\n\nThe turbocharged Touring XT can also haul your friends and family and all their travel accoutrement. It made light work of my single-dude luggage, and when faced with the rotten (nameless) rental car my cohort got in Arizona, it was often requisitioned as a ritzy lunch and dinner sled for four adults, all of whom shared my sentiments about the Outback.\n\nYup, the Outback Touring XT is one of the better road-trip cars I’ve had in a damn long while. I don’t have much else to add to the convo here, considering you’ve already had, oh, five years to decide if you like this current iteration of the Outback. It was minorly refreshed for the 2023 model year, with updated exterior styling and the addition of optional wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto among its changes.\n\n2025 Subaru Outback Touring XT, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Subaru Legacy, Outback Mostly Unchanged; Priced From $26,040 and $30,290\nSubaru Reveals Minor Updates, Pricing for 2024 Legacy, Outback\nHow Much Is the New 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid?\n2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid Up Close: More of a Good Thing\nShop for a 2025 Subaru Outback Near You\nWhat Do We Know About the 2026 Subaru Outback?\n\nConvinced? You’ll have to hurry and make your decision, as we’re expecting a next-gen Outback for the 2026 model year, and spy shots indicate it will be a significant departure from the wagon-esque profile we’ve known since day one; the new version eschews the current Outback’s long roof for a boxier appearance and layout that’s more in line with the automaker’s Forester compact SUV. \n\nGood or bad, when that new generation appears, I know exactly where I’m gonna take it.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new Subaru Outback may not look terribly new, but it is — and it’s the best one Subaru has ever made.\n\nVersus the competition: It has some impressive SUV competitors, but when you factor in the Subaru’s value-leading pricing, it’s hard to find one that drives as well as the Outback, includes as much equipment and costs so little to own and operate.\n\nTwo decades ago, when Subaru took its Legacy wagon and jacked it up, slapped on plastic cladding and gave it an outdoorsy name, nobody imagined the Subaru Outback would become the automaker’s most beloved, best-selling model. I drove an all-new sixth-generation 2020 Outback in Northern California at a Subaru media event, and all I can say is this: If you’re a fan of the current Outback, wait till you get behind the wheel of this one — you’re going to absolutely love it. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nLooks the Same, Feels Completely Different\n\nThe redesigned 2020 Outback barely looks different from the outgoing model, with just a few slightly updated, vaguely evolutionary design cues in its chunky, hiking-boot styling. But fiercely loyal Outback customers don’t care — they like the way the Outback looks just fine; the old one was still selling in record numbers even as the new one was just a few weeks away.\n\nTo be fair, the design works. Selective use of high-strength steel keeps the pillars thin for excellent outward visibility. The beltline remains low for a commanding view over the hood or to the sides. And the hiking boot analogy really does work for the Outback, with a chunky plastic lower portion and a sleek, colorful upper one, just like what its customers tend to wear on their feet. But the magic of the new 2020 Outback isn’t in the way it looks, it’s in how it drives.\n\n2020 Subaru Outback | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nPunching Above Its Class\n\nThanks to an all-new platform, torsional rigidity is up an almost unbelievable 70 percent, which gave engineers a steadfast foundation on which to build the suspension, steering and braking systems. Put simply, the Outback drives like a premium luxury vehicle. Think Audi A6 or Volvo V90 wagon, not SUV competitors like the Chevrolet Blazer, Hyundai Santa Fe or Jeep Grand Cherokee. The Outback’s body control is exceptional, with ride and handling that feels sophisticated in a way I haven’t experienced before in a Subaru product. Subaru’s Ascent three-row SUV is pretty good, but its bulk prevents it from being enjoyable to drive. Not so in the Outback; while the steering isn’t huge on feel or feedback, it does have firmness, heft, accuracy and a surprisingly quick steering ratio that makes the car feel nimble.\n\nThat outstanding platform and suspension are matched by equally good powertrains. The base engine is a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat-four-cylinder making 176 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, and as with most Subarus, all-wheel drive is standard. The engine is perfectly matched to the transmission and temperament of the car. It never felt slow or ponderous, never felt like it was in the wrong “gear” (not that it has any traditional fixed gears), never struggled from a standing start or felt like it wasn’t ready to perform. It’s quiet, too; cruising along through the hushed redwood forests of Northern California, it was easygoing and almost silent.\n\nMy only quibble with the engine was during off-road excursions, when its low-speed X-Mode off-road mode was engaged. It’s there that the accelerator response gets a little too sensitive, making it difficult to drive smoothly across broken terrain or open fields. Admittedly, this isn’t something most Outback drivers are likely to do every day, but enough owners do use their cars off-road to make this a notable characteristic.\n\nIf you’re looking for more power, Subaru has you covered. The Outback’s optional powertrain (standard on Outback XT trims) is a turbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four that makes a healthy 260 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque. The old 3.6-liter flat-six-cylinder engine has been discontinued. The turbo four’s grunt is noticeable, providing immediate response and brisk acceleration with less input from the accelerator pedal. But honestly, the base engine is so good and provides enough motivating force that the only reason to spend money on the more powerful engine is if you live at elevations where turbocharging helps you get up hills and mountains — or if you plan on towing.\n\nThe 2020 Outback with the turbo engine can tow 3,500 pounds when properly equipped, while the base 2.5-liter engine can haul 2,700 pounds. The base engine has decent EPA fuel economy ratings (26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined), and the turbocharged engine takes a 3-mpg hit to all figures. Note that still means the more powerful motor is rated 30 mpg on the highway. The extra power the turbo engine provides is fun, but it’s simply not needed in the Outback — and that’s the first time I’ve ever said that about any Subaru.\n\nUpgraded Interior, State-of-the-Art Multimedia\n\nInside, the 2020 Outback features the same mix of comfort, space and versatility that has made it a perennial favorite of our staff. Subaru has had this recipe right for a while now, and the new model simply had to maintain that combination — which it does. The seats are comfortable up front and in back, with plenty of legroom. The backseat is firmer than expected and sits slightly raised, providing stadium-style seating to help passengers see out the windshield.\n\n2020 Subaru Outback | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nNew for 2020 is a trim level called the Onyx Edition XT, which brings blacked-out trim to the exterior but, more importantly, brings a new neoprene-based upholstery that Subaru calls StarTex. StarTex seats are a multihued gray with blue stitching, and while it doesn’t exactly feel like leather or neoprene (the material wetsuits are typically made from), it’s supposedly highly water-resistant — perfect for outdoorsy types coming in from surfing or kayaking. The optional Nappa leather surfaces on Touring trim levels are quite nice — not exactly luxury-brand levels of opulence, but pleasantly premium for sure.\n\nBut the real news inside is the big 11.6-inch tablet-style multimedia display on higher trims. Subaru joins the ranks of Tesla, Ram, Volvo and Ford with this big, vertically oriented touchscreen. (Base Outbacks use two 7-inch touchscreen panels, one for multimedia and the other for climate controls; Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on both systems.)\n\nWhile the system in Ram trucks is done well, it still splits a lot of functions into two areas despite having one large screen. The Volvo system is a bit monochromatic and can be slow to engage. But Subaru’s system is fantastic, using big, colorful icons that are simple to find and engage at a glance. The entire panel is customizable for icon location and shortcut icons, enabling you to arrange the large panel to do whatever you need it to. Opt for the navigation-equipped unit on top trim levels and the map can be expanded to fill the entire screen. It may take a little while to get familiar with how to customize it, but once they do, owners will be able to create a screen unique to their vehicle that works best for them, just as personal mobile electronics do.\n\n2020 Subaru Outback | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nCarry More Stuff\n\nAlong with the Outback’s new platform comes a boost in nearly all dimensions, but the numbers don’t reflect that. From 2019 to 2020, Subaru changed how it measures cargo volume in order to conform to a new industry specification standard. As a result, on paper it looks like the Outback has lost volume inside, dropping from 35.5 to 32.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, but in reality, it has gained room for both passengers and cargo — it’s simply being measured differently, Subaru says. For example, measured by the old standard, the 2020 Outback’s maximum cargo space would have been 78 cubic feet, up from 73.3 cubic feet for the 2019. By the new standard, the 2020 measures 75.7 cubic feet.\n\nThe car’s novel roof rack has been retained, featuring crossbars integrated into the side rails that you can swing out and lock when necessary. The Outback’s low roof is one key to its popularity with buyers — unlike on a taller SUV, mounting bikes or boats or camping gear on the Outback’s roof is easy thanks to its lower overall stature.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the Outback features more interior room than a number of popular traditional-style two-row SUVs: The 32.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat is more than in the Chevrolet Blazer (30.5 cubic feet), and its overall volume beats both the Blazer (64.2 cubic feet) and the latest Hyundai Santa Fe (71.3 cubic feet). The Honda Passport outdoes it for interior room, however, with a massive 50.5 cubic feet behind the backseat and 100.7 cubic feet overall.\n\n2020 Subaru Outback | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\nOff the Beaten Path\n\nA good number of Outback owners use their vehicles for off-pavement activities, and although it might be surprising to hear, the Outback is a capable off-road machine. It has 8.7 inches of ground clearance, which is more than a past-generation base Jeep Wrangler Sport with 16-inch wheels. Subaru provided a challenging two-track off-road course through a private ranch in the hills around Northern California’s “Lost Coast” region to show off the car’s X-Mode software, which changes the car’s standard all-wheel drive to aid in sticky situations. For slippery conditions, a new dual-mode X-Mode function adds a Deep Snow/Mud setting to the Snow/Dirt system, but it’s only available on the Onyx Edition XT trim; why it can’t be had across the board is a mystery.\n\nBut even without the new dual-mode function, the Outback will go places you might not think it could. A front-mounted trail camera helps when your vehicle’s nose is in the air and you can’t see where the trail goes, but the car does have limitations: While it has some underbody protection, it doesn’t have the massive skid plates of a true off-roader like a Jeep Wrangler (though Subaru will sell you additional protection from its accessory parts catalog). It also has fairly long front and rear overhangs, and its long wheelbase makes for a milder breakover angle. It’ll go over the river and through some pretty serious woods, just don’t get too carried away.\n\nSafety at No Additional Cost\n\nThe 2020 Outback hasn’t yet been tested for crashworthiness by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of this writing, but Subaru is aiming to continue the 2019 model’s Top Safety Pick Plus IIHS status and five-star NHTSA rating. The Outback gets Subaru’s EyeSight safety system standard, featuring forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control and more. The DriverFocus system first seen in the 2019 Subaru Forester is here, too, using facial recognition technology to alert drivers to distractions or dozing; it’s optional on Limited models and standard on the Touring. It’s also used to set seat memory, mirror position, climate settings and even a programmable personal greeting for different drivers.\n\nUnlike many competitors, the company doesn’t make you pay extra for this extraordinary level of safety, but if you want even more, you can add a blind spot warning system with cross-traffic alert, keyless entry and push-button start, much of which is standard on upper trim levels.\n\n2020 Subaru Outback | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nAll of that adds to the Outback’s overall stellar value proposition. The base price for a 2020 Outback is just about $300 more than an outgoing 2019 model, starting at $27,655 (all prices include destination). I drove two well-equipped versions: an Outback Touring with the base engine ($38,355 as tested) and an Outback Onyx XT ($37,750). Loaded up with everything, the Outback tops out at just under $41,000.\n\nThose are stunning prices in a world of competitors now easily pushing $50,000 or more for their loaded-up two-row SUVs. The latest Chevrolet Blazer and Jeep Grand Cherokee can easily go north of $53,000 in premium trims, for instance, and the Nissan Murano and Ford Edge often sell in the high-$40,000 range. For the money, the Outback represents a tremendous value, an outstanding driving experience and a useful utility vehicle loaded with safety tech.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Adaptive LED headlights, and backseat and passenger seat belt reminders now standard\n\nPrice change: $150 increase for base, Premium, Limited and Touring trims; $250 increase for Onyx Edition XT, Limited XT and Touring XT; destination charge increases $40 to $1,050\n\nOn sale: October\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? 2021. Lower-level trims and Onyx Edition XT add adaptive LED headlights as standard, and the price increases are minimal on all models.\n\nSubaru redesigned the all-wheel-drive Outback wagon for 2020 to make it closer to a crossover, though it still shares its design with the Legacy sedan and differs mainly in its taller ground clearance and SUV styling cues. For 2021, the base, Premium and Onyx Edition XT trims gain standard adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of turns, making that feature standard across the board (all models already had LED headlights as standard). Also newly standard are a reminder to check the backseat before leaving the vehicle and a seat belt reminder for passengers.\n\nRelated: Who Makes Subaru?\n\nPrice\n\nPrice increases are modest: $150 on the base, Premium, Limited and Touring models and $250 on the others. The destination charge is $40 higher at $1,050.\n\nThe base model starts at $27,845 (all prices include destination), and there are no factory options available to pad the price. Prices climb rapidly, though, to $30,095 for the Premium, $34,645 for the Limited and $38,545 for the Touring. The top-of-the-line Touring XT is $40,995.\n\nFeatures and Safety Tech\n\nAll models come with AWD, a continuously variable automatic transmission and the EyeSight safety suite that includes automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. All models also seat five.\n\nEngine\n\nBase, Premium, Limited and Touring models come with a 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter boxer four-cylinder engine. The Onyx Edition XT, Limited XT and Touring XT come with a turbocharged 260-hp, 2.4-liter horizontally opposed engine. \n\nInterior\n\nThe Outback has a roomy, functional interior with ample cargo space, and higher-level models come with an 11.6-inch vertically oriented screen for the well-executed multimedia system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all models.\n\nPerformance and Gas Mileage\n\nThe base engine feels sluggish and the CVT does little to help performance, but the turbo engine delivers more satisfying performance. If you consider the Outback a compact to mid-size SUV, the EPA combined city/highway fuel economy estimates of 29 mpg for the 2.5-liter engine compares favorably with other five-seat competitors.\n\nA comfortable ride and competent handling give the Outback good road manners, and with 8.7 inches of ground clearance, it can handle light off-road duty. The standard X-Mode system adjusts engine, transmission and AWD settings for greater off-road traction, and the Onyx Edition comes with a Deep Snow/Mud setting. Towing capacities are modest: 2,700 pounds with the 2.5-liter engine and 3,500 with the turbo 2.4-liter.\n\nThe Outback was a pioneer in steering the auto industry away from truck-based SUVs to car-based crossovers, and it still offers decent value in a five-seat, versatile family vehicle.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The wagon that arguably created the crossover utility vehicle segment, the Subaru Outback, chugs into 2009 as one of the stalwarts among the modern, compact family haulers.\n\nWith a makeover just last year, the ’09 Outback continues the theme that the Japanese automaker introduced with the first model, for 1995, billed as the world’s first sport utility wagon.\n\nThe term “crossover” hadn’t been thought of yet when the Outback arrived, but it was ahead of its time, as it’s now clear that it was the first true crossover utility vehicle – although Toyota claims to have created the genre with the 1996 introduction of the RAV4.\n\nWhat made the Outback and RAV4 different was that they were small SUV-like vehicles built on the chassis of cars.\n\nBut it was initially just a marketing ploy for Subaru to call the Outback a sport utility. At that time, Subaru and other automakers were scrambling to compete in a market that was going crazy over the new truck-based sport utility vehicles, whose sales began in earnest with the introduction of the Ford Explorer in fall 1990.\n\nBecause Subaru had no trucks in its lineup to mold into a true SUV, the company took its Legacy midsize wagon and beefed it up to create the Outback.\n\nThen, in another stroke of marketing genius, Subaru signed up Australian actor Paul Hogan, reprising his “Crocodile Dundee” role, to promote the Outback.\n\nThe Outback name also was later given to a beefed-up Legacy sedan, and an even beefier-looking version of the smaller Impreza wagon. But for 2009, only the Legacy wagon version carries the Outback name; the sedan version is gone.\n\nThis vehicle is still a worthy competitor to the other pioneering mini-crossovers, the RAV4 and the Honda CR-V, which followed the RAV onto the market for 1997.\n\nBut the Outback is by nature a better utility vehicle than the base versions of the RAV4 and CR-V, because all Outbacks come with all-wheel drive, which is an option on the Toyota and Honda models. In fact, Subaru includes all-wheel drive as a standard feature on all of its U.S. models.\n\nChanges last year included a slightly redesigned exterior that included new front sheet metal, a larger grille opening, new front and rear bumpers, and new headlights and taillights.\n\nThere were a few interior changes as well, including a new instrument panel and revised seat fabrics. A telescopic steering wheel and an ignition key with built-in remote are standard now.\n\nFor 2009, there are some upgrades as well, including standard electronic stability control on all models. Also, the Limited model replaced the L.L. Bean version, and there is a new “Special Edition” model that gets such extras as heated front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, wiper de-icing, heated side mirrors, fog lights, and an eight-way power driver’s seat.\n\nAlso new is a premium 440-watt Harmon Kardon audio system, which comes standard on the Limited models.\n\nThe 2009 Outback models start at $19,995 (plus $695 freight) for the base Sport model with a 2.5-liter boxer four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual gearbox, and run as high as $32,095 for the Limited 3.0 R model, which has a six-cylinder boxer (horizontally opposed) engine and a five-speed automatic.\n\nIn between are the 2.5i, 2.5i Special Edition, 2.5i Limited, and 2.5XT Limited models, which come with either the five-speed manual gearbox, or in the case of the 2.5i Limited model, a four-speed automatic.\n\nOur tester was the 2.5i Limited, which carries a base price of $30,495 (plus freight). But that price included even the dash-mounted GPS/DVD navigation system. The only option on our vehicle was a rear cargo net ($51), making the total sticker $31,241 including freight.\n\nThe 2.5-liter engine is rated at 170 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of torque, and has EPA ratings of 20 mpg city/26 highway with the four-speed automatic.\n\nThe 2.5XT is set up as a performance model, with a turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter engine, rated at 243 horsepower and 241 foot-pounds of torque. Standard is the five-speed manual.\n\nThe top-of-the-line Limited 3.0R is the only model that comes with the normally aspirated 3.0-liter six-cylinder boxer, with 245 horsepower and 215 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe most fun to drive is the turbo four with the manual gearbox. But if you want an automatic transmission, the XT is available with the five-speed sport-shift transmission that comes with the 3.0R Limited.\n\nThis gearbox can do all the shifting for you, or you can put it in manual mode and shift gears yourself using the paddles on the steering wheel (without having to worry about a clutch, of course).\n\nIt’s a kick to drive, thanks to that engine, the sport transmission, and Subaru’s Intelligent Drive system, which allows for putting the vehicle’s electronic throttle control system into a sport mode for what Subaru calls “lightning-quick throttle response” for “more power sooner.”\n\nAlso included with the Limited models is Subaru’s best all-wheel-drive system, which includes variable torque distribution. This feature normally sends more power to the rear wheels to enhance handling, Subaru says, and it automatically adjusts power distribution in response to driving and road conditions.\n\nOur tester’s 170-horsepower engine had plenty of power for everyday driving.\n\nThe Outback has seating for up to five people; unlike the RAV4, there is no third seat offered. But the CR-V doesn’t offer a third seat, either. There is a 33.5 cubic-foot cargo area behind the rear seat.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995. 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, four- or six-cylinder, all-wheel-drive, five-passenger crossover utility vehicle. Highlights: Slightly redesigned last year this is the sport utility wagon version of the Subaru Legacy midsize sedan. It comes with room for five, lots of cargo space, and many standard features, even at the base level.\n\nNegatives: Can get quite pricey for a compact crossover without a luxury brand name.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (normally aspirated or turbocharged); 3.0-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual, four-speed automatic or five-speed automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 170 HP/170 ft-lbs (H-4); 243 HP./241 ft-lbs. (Turbo); 245 HP./215 ft.-lbs. (H-6).\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted, front and rear side curtain, standard.\n\nVehicle stability control: Standard.\n\nLength: 189.0 inches.\n\nCargo capacity: 33.5 cubic feet (behind rear seat).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 miles per gallon city/27 highway (H-4 manual); 20 city/26 highway (H-4 automatic); 18 city/24 highway (Turbo automatic); 17/24 (3.0-liter).\n\nMajor competitors: Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, Mitsubishi Outlander, Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Mazda Tribute, Chevrolet Equinox/Pontiac Torrent/Saturn Vue.\n\nBase price range: $19,995-$32,095 plus $695 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $31,241 including freight and options.\n\nOn the Road rating: 9.1 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "When we tested Subaru’s so-called Sport Utility Sedan last year, we told you we thought it was a silly concept, worthy of that old huckster P.T. Barnum.\n\nApparently Subaru’s marketing wizards have seen the light, and have rechristened this otherwise competent all-wheel-drive sedan, which gets a substantial redesign for 2000 and a new name: The Outback Limited Sedan.\n\nSubaru has made some notable mechanical improvements to the car, and loaded it up with all kinds of accessories. But is the $26,650 Outback Limited Sedan really superior to the regular Legacy Sedan, which lists for under $20,000?\n\nShe: I’ll answer that question right away. Save your money and go for the Legacy with its standard all-wheel drive. Unless you really need such affectations as big fog lights with stone guards and two-tone paint, two features on the Outback. In fact, the Outback reminds me of the Pontiac Montana minivan that masquerades as a sport-ute. Maybe the auto companies have to sugar-coat their practical vehicles to get guys to swallow them. Surely, their wives and significant others aren’t that easily fooled.\n\nHe: So are you saying the Outback sedan is aimed at men or women?\n\nShe: Men.\n\nHe: Wrong, wrong, wrong. Sorry, but I don’t need lower body cladding, oversized bumpers and a jacked-up suspension if I’m in the market for a mid-sized sedan. If I’m looking for a sport-ute, chances are I’m going for a truck, not a passenger car. I really like the idea of having all-wheel drive on my family sedan, but why should I pay a premium for the Outback when I can get a nicely equipped Legacy for several thousand dollars less? Or does that sound too practical and sensible to be coming from a guy?\n\nShe: I just saw you out on the driveway admiring the exterior of the Outback. So you sing a different song in print. You love those gold-accented alloy wheels, don’t you?\n\nHe: They don’t bother me as much as they bother you. Just because I admire the appearance of the Outback doesn’t necessarily mean I’d be willing to spend nearly 27 grand on one. Haven’t you ever admired a St. John dress in the window at Neiman Marcus? I don’t see one hanging in your closet.\n\nShe: Boy, I really hit a nerve. If you are trying to sell people on the Outback, it’s hard to make a case. For 2000, all Subaru vehicles include 24-hour roadside help. So if you can get it on the cheaper Legacy, why bother with the Outback?\n\nHe: We both agree. So what’s the argument?\n\nShe: Whether this is a guy car or a girl car. It’s a guy car.\n\nHe: It’s a good car. Let’s leave sex out of this conversation for once, and talk about nuts and bolts. Like the new multi-link suspension, which improves ride control and comfort. Or the greatly improved cabin, which looks as good as anything Honda or Toyota is doing. I just wish I could order a six-cylinder engine on this car. Even with more low-end torque this year, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder invariably runs out of steam, especially if you’re trying to accelerate and merge with freeway traffic in an automatic-transmission model. On the plus side, our Outback got 22 miles per gallon in city driving and 27 on the highway. Try to squeeze that kind of mileage out of your SUV.\n\nShe: Subaru does tap into the mind set of SUV owners in some ways. Our Outback Limited had great standard features like a weather-band radio, heated front seats and exterior mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icer. It does make you feel prepared for bad weather. And the safety features are terrific. They include standard front and side air bags and anti-lock brakes. Unfortunately, you can’t get side air bags on a regular Legacy sedan, unless you order the top-of-the-line Limited model.\n\nHe: I still don’t know exactly who will buy an Outback Limited sedan. For that kind of money, I’d rather have an Audi A4 Quattro.\n\nShe: I’m giving the Outback Limited two stars because I’m not convinced of its appeal or dability. I’m very lukewarm about it. But I guess if you can be mesmerized by its very presence in our driveway, you’d better give it three stars. Poor baby. Fooled again by looks.\n\n2000 Subaru Outback Limited\n\nAnita’s rating: acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: above average\n\nType: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $25,895; as tested, $26,650 (inc. $495 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter 4 cylinder; 165-hp; 166 lb.-ft. torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city/27 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,322*\n\n* Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.\n\nWhere built: Lafayette, Ind.\n\nWhat we liked: Love the weather-band radio (Anita); huge trunk; one of the few all-wheel-drive sedans in the mid-size segment; ride and handling on a par with Honda and Toyota; greatly improved cabin.\n\nWhat we disliked: Sluggish acceleration, especially with automatic transmission; desperately needs a six-cylinder option; fake wood looks really fake; get rid of the gold wheels (Anita); regular Legacy sedan is a better value.",

      "expert_review": "Some circles should be broken. The Subaru H6-3.0 Outback sedan is proof.\n\nIt is the unfortunate progeny of a trend in which cars became pickup trucks in the manner of the 1959 Chevrolet El Camino — then pickup trucks became sport-utility vehicles, SUVs became hybrid wagon/truck/minivans and hybrid wagon/truck/minivans became sedans.\n\nIn the case of the H6-3.0 Outback sedan, both the tested 2002 and the slightly changed 2003 version, the result is an ugly car that rides like a truck.\n\nI can put it no other way.\n\nThe car is ugly, square, confused, stylistically injured. Its face says SUV. Its side panels, including its egregious lower-body cladding, say pickup truck. Its boxy rear end bespeaks the severest form of automotive celibacy. I wish that Subaru had left this one alone, had left it as God intended it to be — a wagon/SUV with modest off-road and excellent all-weather driving capabilities.\n\nThe Outback was and remains desirable as a wagon/SUV. In that form, it has commodious cargo volume, up to 34.3 cubic feet, compared with a relatively paltry 12.4 cubic feet for the sedan. Its 7.9-inch ground clearance befits its standing and handling as an all-wheel-drive wagon/SUV. That means you expect it to dip and sway a bit in the curves.\n\nBut the identical ground clearance in the sedan version can get you into trouble if you take a curve too fast. The acceptable dip and sway in the wagon/SUV threatens to become a dip-sway-skid in the 2002 sedan, for example. Subaru is apparently aware of this, because the company is using new front struts with internal rebound springs to help reduce body roll in the 2003 model.\n\nIt truly pains me to write these things. Regular readers of this column know that I like Subaru and have often hailed its many virtues.\n\nBut the simple fact is that the H6-3.0 Outback sedan is disappointing.\n\nIt’s like watching an A student turn into a dropout candidate. In such a circumstance, the shocked observer must grab any straw of hope available. Luckily, the H6-3.0 Outback sedan has more than a few.\n\nThe engine is the soul of any car, and the Outback sedan, in that regard, has a very good soul. It is a 3-liter (thus the “3.0” part of the car’s name), horizontally opposed (thus the “H”), 24-valve six-cylinder engine that produces 212 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 210 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. Power delivery is smooth. The car has no trouble accelerating when it must.\n\nAlso, Subaru’s all-wheel-drive system remains the best in the business, and it does not lose that distinction in the Outback sedan. I ran into very little rain during my week in the 2002 H6-3.0 Outback. But a little rain on a highway packed with months of grease and grime can be a very dangerous thing. Just enough water falls to mix with the oil and dirt and bring the slippery mess to the surface, turning the affected highway into a skid pad. When that happened on one of my Outback sedan drives, I was happy to be in the car, which suddenly seemed beautiful.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system, effortlessly shifting power from slipping to gripping wheels, worked perfectly.\n\nThe Outback sedan can be saved. Subaru only needs to do to the car’s body and its corner-handling characteristics what it’s done to its soul.",

      "expert_review": "Quick, what’s the difference between a Subaru Legacy GT wagon and a Subaru Legacy Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon?\n\nIf you said about $7,000, congratulations, you most certainly have a mind that gets to the bottom line very quickly. For those who want to know what that extra $7,000 gets you, read on.\n\nThis side-by-side comparison presented quite a challenge because I rank the Subaru wagons at the top of the segment. Subaru just has this segment down, and all-wheel drive across the board only sweetens the deal.\n\nMy test started with the top-of-the-line 2001 Subaru Legacy Outback H6-3.0 VDC, which starts at 31,895 (the tested model went for $32,390 with the destination and delivery charge). Now that’s a lot of money to pay for a wagon, even one with a sport-utility-vehicle-like ground clearance of 7.3 inches.\n\nFortunately, Subaru has stuffed a lot into the deal.\n\nThe alphabet soup of the H6-3.0 VDC is explained in part by the engine — a horizontally opposed six-cylinder job containing three liters and dishing out a decidedly enthusiastic 212 horsepower. VDC stands for Vehicle Dynamics Control, Subaru’s language for the stability and all-wheel traction system.\n\nWithout getting too technical, the VDC and AWD and Subaru’s VTD (that’s for “Variable Torque Distribution”) combine to make the Outback go like blazes. I was blowing away assorted coupes and sedans in a wagon — a veritable suburban warrior.\n\nOn the quieter back roads of Yolo County, I also discovered that it’s virtually impossible to make the Outback’s 16-inch all-season radial tires lose contact with the road — even on the sharpest corners. Actor Paul Hogan (also known in the movies as “Crocodile Dundee”) does some aggressive promotion of the Outback’s performance capabilities, and his stock just went up in my house.\n\nInside, the Outback was dressed up with what one would expect from a $32,000 purchase. The package included dual power moonroofs with sunshades, heated front seats and exterior mirrors, front seat side-impact air bags, wood and leather surfaces and a splendid McIntosh audio system with seven speakers and an in-dash CD player.\n\nGas mileage also was admirable, given the pop of the six-cylinder motor — 20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway.\n\nAlthough some would grump that $32,000-plus is too much to pay for a midsize wagon, there’s something to be said for a luxurious wagon that’s nimble on the open road and capable of performing in the back country — as opposed to paying, say, $40,000-and-up for an SUV that does the same thing, while drinking more gasoline, which is quickly on its way to becoming the liquid of the rich and famous.\n\nMy only complaint with the Outback H6-3.0 VDC was being confused over what to call the thing. Subaru’s own literature rarely uses the “Legacy” name with the vehicle, even though it’s right there on the sticker. And the vehicle is alternately called an Outback Wagon, an Outback, a 3.0 wagon, an H6 or an H6-3.0.\n\nEnough already. I finally settled on calling it Crocodile Dundee’s car just to avoid arguments.\n\nStarting with the Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon was a mistake, of course. No matter what, getting into the 2001 Legacy GT wagon felt like a letdown.\n\nNot nearly as luxurious as its Outback cousin, the Legacy GT’s horizontally opposed 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine felt comparatively anemic after riding around in the six-banger.\n\nThen, a funny thing happened. I noticed that the four-cylinder engine was generating some serious punch getting away from intersections where punch was needed. Once the revs were up, the Legacy GT was positively robust in traffic. I normally feel undressed with a four-cylinder engine, but this one started to grow on me.\n\nCall it the all-wheel drive difference.\n\nThe AWD feature made the engine feel more like four-cylinders and an asterisk — with the asterisk desi ating a security-inspiring boost in handling.\n\nOnce the ride felt better, other things started feeling better.\n\nLook up and there’s another pair of power dual moonroofs on the ceiling. The Legacy GT wagon’s mileage rating was 22 mpg city/27 mpg highway. My numbers, however, came out to a more-economical 24/29. The interior felt roomy and comfortable, even from the back seat.\n\nAll in all, the Legacy GT stacked up as a pretty fair AWD wagon with a $23,795 starting price ($25,336 as tested, including an optional automatic gearbox, a modest equipment package and the destination/delivery charge).\n\nThe bottom line is that the Legacy GT wagon really has most of what a wagon-lover craves, and the Subaru dependability numbers in this segment have been good. Obviously, the Outback H6-3.0 VDC wagon is a comparative luxury liner, and it’s priced that way.\n\nThe Outback model seems better suited to the customer who walks into the dealership and says, “I want the absolute best wagon I can get, and I don’t really care how much it costs.”\n\nFor those who simply want a wagon that will make the commute to and from work and then carry the recreational load on the weekends, go with the Legacy GT.",

      "expert_review": "Some circles should be broken. The Subaru H6-3.0 Outback sedan is proof. It is the unfortunate progeny of a trend in which cars became pickup trucks in the manner of the 1959 Chevrolet El Camino — then pickup trucks became sport-utility vehicles, SUVs became hybrid wagon/truck/minivans and hybrid wagon/truck/minivans became sedans.\n\nIn the case of the H6-3.0 Outback sedan, both the tested 2002 and slightly changed 2003 version, the result is an ugly car that rides like a truck.\n\nI can put it no other way.\n\nThe car is ugly, square, confused, stylistically injured. Its face says SUV. Its side panels, including its egregious lower-body cladding, say pickup truck. Its boxy rear end bespeaks the severest form of automotive celibacy. I wish that Subaru had left this one alone, had left it as God intended it to be — a wagon/SUV with modest off-road and excellent all-weather driving capabilities.\n\nThe Outback was and remains desirable as a wagon/SUV. In that form, it has commodious cargo volume, up to 34.3 cubic feet, compared with a relatively paltry 12.4 cubic feet for the sedan. Its 7.9-inch ground clearance befits its standing and handling as an all-wheel-drive wagon/SUV. That means you expect it to dip and sway a bit in the curves.\n\nBut the identical ground clearance in the sedan version can get you into trouble if you take a curve too fast. The acceptable dip and sway in the wagon/SUV threatens to become a dip-sway-skid in the 2002 sedan, for example. Subaru is apparently aware of this, because the company is using new front struts with internal rebound springs to help reduce body roll in the 2003 model.\n\nIt truly pains me to write these things. Regular readers of this column know that I like Subaru and have often hailed its many virtues. But the simple fact is that the H6-3.0 Outback sedan is disappointing. It’s like watching an A student turn into a dropout candidate. In such a circumstance, the shocked observer must grab any straw of hope available. Luckily, the H6-3.0 Outback sedan has more than a few.\n\nThe engine is the soul of any car, and the Outback sedan, in that regard, has a very good soul. It is a 3-liter (thus the “3.0” part of the car’s name), horizontally opposed (thus the “H”), 24-valve six-cylinder engine that produces 212 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 210 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. Power delivery is smooth. The car has no trouble accelerating when it must.\n\nAlso, Subaru’s all-wheel-drive system remains the best in the business, and it does not lose that distinction in the Outback sedan. I ran into very little rain during my week in the 2002 H6-3.0 Outback. But a little rain on a highway packed with months of grease and grime can be a very dangerous thing. Just enough water falls to mix with the oil and dirt and bring the slippery mess to the surface, turning the affected highway into a skid pad. When that hap pened on one of my Outback sedan drives, I was happy to be in the car, which suddenly seemed beautiful. The all-wheel-drive system, effortlessly shifting power from slipping to gripping wheels, worked perfectly.\n\nThe Outback sedan can be saved. Subaru only needs to do to the car’s body and its corner-handling characteristics what it’s done to its soul.",

      "expert_review": "Now in its 13th year, the Subaru Outback wagon is still a viable SUV alternative, though its advantages are no longer exclusive in a growing class of wagons and car-based SUVs. Since its inception, the Outback has remained the same size and concept, which I think is justified, but with each year and each new competitor its still-unaddressed quirks get harder to accept. The optional Subaru Intelligent Drive (SI-Drive) gives drivers a choice between exceptional acceleration or gas mileage that’s promised to be even better than EPA estimates.\n\nWhich Outback?\nThe Outback covered in this review is a version of the midsize Subaru Legacy. There is also a version of the smaller Impreza hatchback called the Outback Sport. Further, it’s the Outback wagon that I tested — the original form that made its debut in 1995 during the heart of the SUV boom. There is also an Outback sedan that shares many of the wagon’s features and attributes.\n\nFrom the beginning, Subaru had the formula that is all the rage now. The market is moving toward lighter, more refined unibody models that are more fuel- and space-efficient, yet retain the attributes most buyers appreciate in SUVs: all-wheel drive, additional ground clearance and the flexibility of a hatchback. All that’s lost is some towing capacity and heavy-duty offroad capability — two things that appeal to a minuscule percentage of owners, especially of smaller models.\n\nAlmost eight years ago we compared an Outback to a Chevrolet Blazer to illustrate that the body-on-frame truck’s exterior bulk didn’t translate to significantly greater interior space in the cabin or the cargo area. A larger interior was often an assumption people made about earlier SUVs, and a wrong one. Now we find that larger car-based SUVs are commensurately roomier inside than the Outback, and their occupants tend to sit higher, with a better view of the road. Both of these are attributes that many buyers don’t want to give up.\n\nWhat Makes an Outback?\nRather than grow the Outback over the years, Subaru finally addressed the SUV market with a larger model, the B9 Tribeca (see my review), so the wagon still has its own identity and place in the market … or does it? Subaru’s own Forester is pretty close in size and utility, and many consider this low-riding model a wagon rather than an SUV. Is it the price that distinguishes one from the other? Well, at the time of this review, the Forester’s suggested retail price range is $21,195 – $27,895 and the Outback’s is $21,995 – $31,495. Hmmmm.\n\nSubaru’s ads now refer to “what makes a Subaru a Subaru.” What makes a Forester a Forester instead of an Outback isn’t all that clear.\n\nOne thing that makes an Outback an Outback instead of a Legacy is more ground clearance — 8.7 inches versus 6.1 inches. It includes the same all-wheel drive that requires no intervention from the driver. Whether it’s snow and ice, gravel or dirt roads, the Outback is unfazed. I’ve driven it on modest offroad trails (legit ones, not just off-pavement), and it can handle more than the vast majority of buyers would put in its way. If the Outback were a person, it would be your outdoorsy friend who always seems to be tan and fit, dressed for action and on his way to climb or ride something, or otherwise involve himself with exertion and dust. Odds are this friend is named Todd or Chad.\n\nRefinement & Poise\nAs before, the Outback offers good ride quality and refinement. Its poise at highway speed in particular still impresses, and it offers more drivetrain choices than ever. There are three engine options, detailed in the table. All come with a manual or automatic transmission, except the six-cylinder, which is automatic only.\n\nOutback Engines\nEngine\tHorizontally opposed 4-cylinder\tTurbocharged horizontally opposed 4-cylinder\tHorizontally opposed 6-cylinder\nSize\t2.5-liter\t2.5-liter\t3.0-liter\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t175 @ 6,000\t243 @ 6,000\t245 @ 6,600\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t169 @ 4,400\t241 @ 3,600\t215 @ 4,200\nTransmission choices\t5-speed manual;\n4-speed auto\t5-speed manual;\n5-speed auto\t5-speed auto\nRecommended gasoline\tregular\n(87 octane)\tpremium\n(91 octane)\tpremium\n(91 octane)\nEPA-estimated gas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t23/28 (man.);\n22/28 (auto)\t21/27 (man.);\n20/26 (auto)*\t19/26\nSource: Manufacturer\n*Estimate for SI-Drive default Sport mode; Intelligent mode is claimed to improve mileage by up to 10 percent.\n\nThe turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder comes with a five-speed manual. My test car, a 2.5 XT Limited, had the optional five-speed automatic with a clutchless-manual mode and the innovative new control mechanism called SI-Drive, which only appears on the Legacy and Outback equipped with this turbo H-4 — not with the optional H-6 engine.\n\nIn terms of regular old driving, this drivetrain offers spirited acceleration, though there’s a lag from a standing start — even if you floor it. By playing with SI-Drive, I found the lag to be acceptable in this regard, but it’s far from ideal. (I’ll address SI-Drive at the end of this review because it demands detailed explanation.)\n\nStill Waiting for Improvements\nUnfortunately, some things haven’t changed. The Outback still requires more brake pedal pressure during a panic stop, though the braking performance overall is fine. Like other models that use the engine, my test vehicle’s turbo four-cylinder tends to jiggle the car a bit when idling. And for the love of all that’s right in the world, can’t Subaru do something about its cabin lighting? My test car’s large moonroof, which is hardly a new feature for Subaru, results in a dome light that’s way behind the front seats. The result is a dark, shadowy front seat and dashboard. The reason this infuriates me is that there are two reading lights between the sun visors that could solve this long-standing problem, if only they came on automatically along with the dome light. It’s truly baffling.\n\nOutback in the Market\nNone of these problems is a deal-breaker, but there’s been plenty of time to address them, and there’s more competition than ever. Many compact and midsize “crossover” SUVs and wagons now ride and handle like cars, too. There are many competitively priced crossover SUVs on the bottom end, and the Outback’s upscale move and related price increases have put it up against some Audis and Volvos on the top end. All-wheel drive is proliferating in every price class. In short, the Outback is still a very good model, but its relative appeal isn’t what it was in 1995 when it was billed as the world’s first sport utility wagon. (Even if you ignore the wagons that Jeep built before there was a Subaru, the Outback wouldn’t deserve that mantle; it would go to the AMC Eagle 4WD wagon sold in the 1980s. Subaru offered 4WD wagons in the ’70s, but if they are the Outback’s ancestors, one look at the Eagle’s elevated ground clearance and styling prove that it was the Outback’s spiritual advisor.)\n\nSI-Drive: Power or Fuel Efficiency at Your Discretion\nThe SI-Drive knob allows the driver to choose among three acceleration programs: Intelligent, Sport and Sport Sharp. Each mode changes the way the accelerator pedal relates to the engine’s throttle, and also varies the transmission’s behavior. In the default setting, Sport, the accelerator pedal’s position has an even effect on engine power. It’s linear and feels like most cars do.\n\nThe Sport Sharp mode makes the pedal more sensitive. The first inch or so of pedal travel yanks much harder on the throttle, so the car accelerates faster — for the amount you’re stepping on the pedal. This mode also lets the engine rev into higher rpm before the transmission upshifts, even when under gradual acceleration, which makes the car more responsive for passing. Note that this doesn’t make the car faster overall. Stand on the pedal and both modes give you full acceleration. It’s the way the car responds under a lighter foot that differs between the two.\n\nThe oddly named Intelligent mode is the opposite of Sport Sharp. It gives you less throttle than the Sport mode for the same amount of pedal travel and, according to Subaru, decreases power and torque by as much as 20 percent. It also makes the transmission shift more conservatively, hopping up through the gears promptly and keeping the engine revving at lower rpm overall. This mode is all about gas mileage. Unfortunately, the EPA fuel economy estimates are based on the default setting, Sport, but Subaru claims the Intelligent mode improves upon that mileage by 10 percent. (That’s a lot.)\n\nUnlike the other two settings, this mode does limit the overall power in such a way that the Outback doesn’t sprint as fast, even if you floor it. I’m not sure how I feel about this. I think the safety issue is too often used by leadfoots to rationalize buying more engine power than they really need, but there’s something to be said for having all of your car’s power available to you at all times in case you need it. Having a modestly powered car is one thing; you adjust your driving. But a car that responds differently at different times could spell trouble. If you forget you’re in Intelligent mode and you put yourself in the path of oncoming traffic, you aren’t going to be able to accelerate as quickly as you might have expected.\n\nFor the record, if you did this, it would be your fault. I’m not a fan of blaming the car or its manufacturer for driver error. That said, this mode, like the others, could be designed to make the engine go full throttle when you floor it. Some cars’ clutchless-manual modes do the same. Ideologically I like the idea of having three settings for an automatic transmission’s behavior, rather than the default and sport settings that have become common in premium and luxury cars. It’s the different throttle progressions that I think are better left to offroad vehicles and special snow modes.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Outback?\n\nWith seating for five and an exceptionally roomy cargo area, the 2023 Subaru Outback is a highly versatile mid-size wagon that’s a compelling choice for shoppers who want SUV levels of space in something that’s a bit more carlike and manageable to drive. The base powertrain is a 182-horsepower four-cylinder paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission; a 260-hp turbo-four is optional, and it delivers notably stronger passing power. All-wheel drive is standard with either engine.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Outback?\n\nThe 2023 Outback receives a modest exterior makeover that consists of a redesigned front bumper, larger grille and slimmer headlights. The Onyx Edition is now available with the naturally aspirated base engine, and Subaru has made improvements to the camera systems related to the Outback’s active-safety features.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Outback Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nDual 7-inch touchscreens\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic climate control\nKeyless entry\nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control \nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n11.6-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nLeather seating surfaces\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nHeated front seats\nHeated rear seats\n12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nHands-free power liftgate\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Outback?\n\nRoomy and relaxing to drive, the Outback is an excellent alternative to both a mid-size sedan and a compact SUV. Standard AWD is a key selling point, though the Outback should also be credited for its strong roster of safety and tech features. The base engine is good on gas, though it can drone under hard acceleration. The turbo four-cylinder in upper trims delivers better performance, and it nudges maximum towing capacity to 3,500 pounds. With its extra ground clearance, underbody skid plates and off-road tires, the Wilderness trim gives the Outback even more outdoorsy appeal and all-terrain capability.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSubarus Outback is a quasi-sport utility vehicle version of the compact Legacy, which is the companys larger series. Known as sport utility wagons, all of these Outback variants of the Legacy feature SUV-like styling cues and a higher ground clearance. Subaru also offers a smaller Outback Sport that is based on the subcompact Impreza.\n\nAt the end of the 2003 model year, Subaru added a base six-cylinder model, designated as the Outback H6-3.0 35th Anniversary Edition. Changes to the Outback are few for 2004.\n\nSeven all-wheel-drive sedan and wagon versions of the Outback are available. They include the H6-3.0 sedan, H6-3.0 L.L. Bean Edition wagon, H6-3.0 VDC sedan and wagon, and three H4 Outbacks. All H6-3.0 models use 3.0-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder engines that produce 212 horsepower. The flagship VDC editions feature Subarus Vehicle Dynamic Control electronic stability system and Variable Torque Distribution all-wheel drive. The three H4 Outbacks are equipped with four-cylinder engines.\n\nExterior\nOutback sedans ride a 104.3-inch wheelbase and measure 184.4 inches long overall, versus a 187.4-inch length for wagon models. The Outback sedan has 7.3 inches of ground clearance and stands 58.3 inches tall, compared to a 55.7-inch height for the regular Legacy sedan. The Outback H6-3.0 models have 7.9 inches of ground clearance.\n\nSubaru says the Outback is suitable for light offroad travel. The Outback sedan borrows some of the Outback wagons styling cues, which include bigger front fenders, lower-body cladding, large fog lights and two-tone paint.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five people is possible with the Outbacks front buckets and rear three-place bench seat. The center rear position has a three-point seat belt. The rear seatback does not fold for additional cargo space, but there is a small pass-thru section into the trunk. Trunk capacity totals 12.4 cubic feet.\n\nThe gauges have silver trim rings. The Outback Limited sedan has a standard six-way power drivers seat, air conditioning, a CD player and dual-mode heated front seats. Outback H6-3.0 models have automatic climate control, an eight-way power drivers seat and a Momo-designed leather-wrapped steering wheel thats crafted in mahogany wood.\n\nGMs OnStar communication system is standard for Outback H6-3.0 models. The Outback Limited and H6-3.0 models have an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubarus 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine in the Outback H4 sedan sends 165 hp to a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. Outback H6-3.0 sedans use a 212-hp, 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that teams only with the automatic. Subaru has three all-wheel-drive systems available, and the version used depends on the model.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. The Outback Limited and H6-3.0 sedans have seat-mounted side-impact airbags to protect front occupants.\n\nOutback Sport\nBased on the smaller subcompact Impreza 2.5 TS and 2.5 RS models, Subarus Outback Sport also comes in sedan and wagon forms. All Impreza-based Subarus have been face-lifted for 2004. These revisions involve the hood, front fenders, headlights, grille, front and rear bumpers, and taillights.\n\nAll versions gain electronic brake-force distribution, an in-glass antenna and a safety brake-pedal system. Outback Sport models get new active head restraints, all-disc brakes, a new Steel Gray Metallic body color and projector-beam fog lights. These models use the same 165-hp, 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine as the Legacy. Displaying SUV-like styling cues, the Outback Sport features exclusive body and interior trim and 16-inch alloy wheels.\n\nOutback Wagon\nLike the Outback sedan, Subarus Outback wagon is based on the compact Legacy. Wagons come in four forms: base, Limited, H6-3.0 L.L. Bean Edition and H6-3.0 VDC.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWith its all-wheel-drive lineup, Subaru occupies a unique niche in the compact-car market. The Outbacks performance is sufficiently strong even with the four-cylinder engine, but a smooth-operating automatic transmission help provide more power. The Outback is easy to drive and is stable on the highway.\n\nAn Outback sedan or wagon adds extra advantages over the Legacy for driving on less-than-perfect roads, and it makes a satisfying alternative to an SUV. They are well assembled and yield a solid feel on the road. But a rather stiff suspension means the Outbacks ride can become harsh, even jarring, on urban pavement.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 11/5/03",

      "expert_review": "Being critical of the 2011 Subaru Outback is like harping on an A- student.  There’s nothing wrong with it at all, but with a little extra effort, the 2011 Outback could definitely be an A+ student.\n\nThis summer I went to the Rocky Mountain Driving Experience, which is a driving event for automotive journalists in Colorado, where I got to take an Outback on a rally course. This isn’t the typical schlepping-of-kids-and-groceries tasks that we generally ask of our vehicles, and I couldn’t believe how well the Outback handled on a high-speed dirt course. The 2011 Outback 3.6R Premium I got to test drive in my daily life was hardly different from the one I drove this summer, and it performed really well in the road course that is my daily life.\n\nI didn’t push the five-seat wagon as hard in real life as I did on the rally course, but that’s not because the Outback didn’t want to. With a six-cylinder engine, I could have gone a lot faster with ease. Unsurprisingly, the six-cylinder has good acceleration and handles with confidence and strength on dirt roads as well as paved ones, thanks to its standard all-wheel drive. The Outback’s suspension allowed me to have a good feel of the road without being horrendously stiff. The inclusion of paddle shifters and manual-shift mode with its five-speed automatic transmission also provided a bit more fun and control, and the braking was responsive and quick.\n\nMy test Outback had an optional Harmon Kardon audio system and dual moonroofs that pushed the base MSRP price of $29,195 up to $32,660, but they’re well worth the additional money.\n \nEXTERIOR\nThe Outback had a major redesign in 2010 in which it got longer, among other things. The 2011 model isn’t significantly different from the 2010. I found the Outback’s looks to be a little generic, but my test car’s Azurite Blue paint helped it look modern.\n\nWhile it looks like a wagon, the Outback has a touch of SUV styling to it because of its higher ground clearance of 8.7 inches. This means the Outback has a good-sized step-in height that can make it harder for kids to climb in independently. It’s not too bad, so they’ll either get used to it or grow into the car.\n\nA terrific feature for active folks is the Outback’s roof rails with stowable cross bars. When the roof rack isn’t in use the cross bars tuck back into the roof rails, which reduces wind noise and improves the car’s aerodynamics. Nice touch, Subaru; A+ again.\n\nMy test car, a 3.6R Premium, had a 256-horsepower, 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine that takes regular gas and gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway. If you’re looking for better fuel economy, the Outback also comes with a 170-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder that gets 22/29 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Outback’s interior has lots of room for both people and cargo, and its easy-to-navigate center stack makes life easy on the driver. \n \n\n\nThe center stack is encased in a brushed-metal-looking plastic. It looked sharp with my test car’s light-colored interior and black dash and floor, but the plastic seemed a little cheap. I’m afraid that’s only worth an A-. The center stack itself is easy to navigate with only a few buttons and knobs on it. This would likely change if you got the optional navigation system, but as it was, my test car’s stereo and climate controls were a cinch to operate. There also were steering-wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls that were easy to use.\n\nThe usability of the Outback’s interior earns an A+. In the front row, there are lots of cubbies, including two in the center stack area and a bilevel center console. The rear legroom was ridiculously large, which made child-safety seats a breeze to install. There wasn’t a single kick to my seatback by the kids, though they may have outgrown that stage. Even if they have, I’m not sure they could’ve reached my seat if they wanted to.\n\nWhile my test Outback had many niceties like the optional dual moonroof that made 10 hours in the car a lot less claustrophobic, there was also the fabric upholstery that has a funky pattern on it that didn’t do anything for me.\n \nSubaru says the Outback has eight cupholders, but it actually has four cupholders and four bottleholders in the doors, which is just fine as far as I’m concerned. The backseat’s cupholders are located in the fold-down armrest, making it easy for kids to reach their drinks.\n\nThe Outback’s cargo area is huge and accommodating, definitely an A+. It’s got a large opening, so it’s not teasing you with a small or awkwardly shaped opening, making it difficult to load things into it. What more could you ask for? Oh, a cargo tray to protect the carpet? Done. A+!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe Outback has been named a Top Safety Pick for 2011 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this honor, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests and have a standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe Outback has tall doors that make it less backbreaking to install a child-safety seat in this wagon. However, the Outback’s two sets of lower Latch anchors aren’t exactly easy to get at because they’re behind dual-flap fabric closures and deeply set in the seat bight, which is where the seat’s back and bottom cushions meet. With lots of rear legroom, the Outback easily handled a rear-facing infant-safety seat, a convertible seat and a booster seat with no fit issues at all.\n\nThe 2011 Subaru Outback has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel antilock brakes with brake assist, electronic stability system, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags in the front row and side curtains in both rows.\n\nA backup camera is an optional feature that’s part of a $1,445 or $2,740 options packages.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Subaru Outback 3.6R Premium here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2013 Subaru Outback wagon sports a new four-cylinder drivetrain, a revised suspension and tweaked styling. Related to the Legacy sedan, the five-seat Outback competes with midsize wagons like the Toyota Venza and Honda Crosstour. A new, optional EyeSight system includes a number of advanced safety features.\n\nThe four-cylinder Outback will come in 2.5i, 2.5i Premium and 2.5i Limited models. A six-cylinder model comes in 3.6R and 3.6R Premium trims.\n\nExterior\nExterior styling updates like new headlights, grille, front bumper and fog lights combine to give the new Outback a more rugged look. The Outback’s rear crossbars now have two mounting points 9.8 inches apart, allowing them to accommodate bikes or longer canoes better than last year’s narrower mounting points. The Outback has 8.7 inches of ground clearance, a figure more common among SUVs.\n\nInterior\nUpgraded seat fabric and new faux-wood trim distinguish the cabin for 2013. Limited models add backseat air vents, keyless access with push-button start and new electroluminescent gauges flanking a 3.5-inch color display. All trims gain standard Bluetooth phone connectivity with audio streaming. Options include a navigation system, power front seats, Harman Kardon audio and heated leather upholstery.\n\nFold the rear seats down, and the Outback’s 71.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo room beats the 2012 Crosstour, Venza and Nissan Murano.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA revised four-cylinder powertrain increases torque and horsepower slightly from the 2012 model. The new 2.5-liter boxer four-cylinder puts out 173 horsepower and 174 pounds-feet of torque, compared to 170 hp and 170 pounds-feet with the old engine.\n\nTransmission choices include a six-speed manual and a new version of Subaru’s continuously variable automatic transmission. The latter features a six-speed manual mode with steering-wheel paddle shifters. CVT-equipped Outbacks are estimated to see a bump in EPA gas mileage, and all-wheel drive remains standard. Outback 3.6R models will be offered in base and Limited trims and carryover with the same 256-horsepower, 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSubaru says the Outback’s revamped suspension improves ride smoothness while reducing body roll up to 40 percent.\n\nSafety\nSix airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Subaru’s optional EyeSight system packages adaptive cruise control, collision braking, lane departure and more. It uses two cameras in the headliner on either side of the rearview mirror.",

      "expert_review": "The Outback version of Subaru’s station wagon was a harbinger of things to come when it was first introduced some eight years ago.\n\nThis car-based wagon was cast as an alternative to truck-based SUVs, and it soon created a loyal fan base, particularly in mountainous areas or northern climes where snowfall is measured in feet, not inches.\n\nIn daily driving, the Outback feels like a regular car. It has room for four without the bulk of a large vehicle, but the cargo area is modest because of the low roof. Four-wheel drive gives it good balance in turns and slippery conditions.\n\nThe stiff body structure provides a solid base for the independent suspension, and the ride is comfortable without being soft or sloppy. The Outback’s taller stance gives enough ground clearance for rough roads without unduly harming the way the car handles on dry pavement.\n\nBy combining the drivability of a car with all-wheel drive and a rugged look, the Outback began to define a market segment that is now growing exponentially. Crossover SUVs, such as Subaru’s own Tribeca B9, are basically larger, taller versions of the Outback concept.\n\nFor 2006, the Outback has continued to grow up in manners, if not in size. The top 3.0 R model has a 250-horsepower six-cylinder engine, and the VRDC Limited has a full complement of luxury equipment.\n\nThe test car was the VRDC Limited, and it is a far cry from its forebears. Brushed silver trim and matte-finished woodgrain trim caused a friend to comment how it has become as nice as some entry-level luxury cars. Prices start at $24,795 for the 2.5-liter four-cylinder with a manual transmission and top out at $35,695 for the VRDC Limited. Folks who are looking for Outback practicality at a lower price will find the four-cylinder model perfectly satisfying, and it starts at $24,795.\n\nEven though the VRDC Limited is a fairly pricey model, its level of equipment is on par with other vehicles in this price segment. The interior sparkles with a nicely designed gauge package, a soft-touch surface on the instrument panel and leather upholstery. Fingertip controls on the steering wheel make it easy to change the radio. Automatic climate control and the navigation system are both part of the VRDC package.\n\nThe split-folding rear seat is a cinch to tumble when you need extra length for hauling large items. The floor-to-ceiling height is what you would expect to find in a station wagon, not an SUV, and that inhibits the size of the objects you can carry. If you need to consistently haul large items, check out the B9 Tribeca.\n\nPower is one of the strengths of the horizontally opposed 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine. Because the cylinders are horizontal rather than vertical, the “boxer” engine configuration has a low center of gravity that contributes to good handling. Six cylinders are way smoother than four cylinders, especially in an engine with this layout. Variable valve timing and valve lift control help broaden this engine’s power band, and that translates into good acceleration from a stop.\n\nThe other thing that contributes to the Outback’s proficiency is Subaru’s all-wheel-drive system that powers all four wheels all the time and automatically transfers more power to the wheels with the best traction. The 3.0 R VRDC’s system has a variable torque distribution system that gives slightly more power to the rear wheels for better response in turns. In slippery conditions, the front wheels take more power as they need. A vehicle stability system with integrated four-wheel traction control adds to the effectiveness of four-wheel drive.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission has a gated shift lever with a sportshift function that enables the driver to change gears manually.\n\nSubaru continues to add equipment and sophistication to the Outback, and the VRDC Limited sets a new standard.\n\n– – –\n\nPrice: The test car’s base price was $35,695. Freight brought the sticker price to $36,320.\n\nWarranty: Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter, 250-hp 6-cylinder\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,635 lbs.\n\nBase price: $35,695\n\nAs driven: $36,320\n\nMpg: 19 city, 26 hwy\n\n– – –\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: The VRDC Limited is the most luxurious Outback yet. Soft leather, woodgrain trim and a navigation system are ideal companions to the 3.0-liter, 250-horsepower six-cylinder engine that drives all four wheels. The Outback combines attractive styling with sure traction.\n\nCounterpoint: Because the Outback is basically a four-wheel-drive station wagon, its cargo area is somewhat limited.\n\n– – –\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.",

      "expert_review": "The post-Christmas snow descended with militant urgency, wind-blown at 37 mph. By the time it ended, our travel plans were redrawn.\n\nThe 2011 rear-wheel-drive Dodge Durango Crew sport-utility vehicle, with its 290-horsepower V-6 engine and commodious, comfortable cabin, would remain parked in the driveway here.\n\nThe 2010 Subaru Outback Limited 2.5i wagon, with its small 170-horsepower four-cylinder engine, and its relatively tight-fit cabin, would be the family’s transportation workhorse for the rest of the holiday season.\n\nThe difference was all-wheel drive. The Outback Limited 2.5i, usually garaged at our Cornwall house, had it. The version of the Durango driven here didn’t.\n\nBig, rear-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles are great in places such as Louisiana and Mississippi, where snow remains a foreign concept. But Cornwall, 55 miles north of New York City, located on the western shore of the Hudson River, is Subaru territory.\n\nBragging rights here go to vehicles that can keep moving with agility and confidence in severe winter weather. Subaru, having developed one of the world’s best functioning, most reliable, symmetrical all-wheel-drive systems, is leader of that pack.\n\nWe drove the Durango here from our Northern Virginia homestead because we needed a vehicle with hauling ability. The five-door Durango Crew has lots of that. It can carry 1,300 pounds onboard and haul a trailer weighing 7,400 pounds.\n\nThere were heated family arguments about the Durango Crew’s potentially lousy rear-wheel-drive performance in snow. But in the manner of a politician pushing through a last-minute amendment in homage to rank self-interest, I argued that we’d “be all right” because the Durango was fitted with “all-terrain” tires.\n\nIt was baloney cooked up to save gas money.\n\nVehicles with only rear-wheel or front-wheel drive generally use less fuel than those with all-wheel-drive, in which drive power shifts to wheels that grip from wheels that slip; or models with dedicated four-wheel drive, in which drive power flows to all four wheels simultaneously.\n\nPutting “all-terrain” or “all-season” tires on rear-wheel-drive or front-wheel-drive vehicles is a time-tested marketing scam, employed to sell “peace-of-mind” to residents of traditionally mild climates who the sellers expect/hope will never experience a close dance with ice or snow.\n\nResidents of traditionally frigid climates know that rear-drive or front-drive coupled with “all-terrain” or “all-season” tires usually means slippery going, or no going at all.\n\nAmple evidence of that truth was on display in several trips to New York City, where public officials apparently mistook the term “blizzard” to mean “non-emergency.”\n\nIncredibly, many of the streets in the world’s greatest financial center were unplowed and untreated. Large city buses were stuck in the snow. Big, rear-wheel-drive delivery trucks were rendered undeliverable. One benighted soul apparently thought the $341,000 price tag of a rear-wheel-drive Bentley Brooklands coupe was a measurement of the car’s prowess in snow.\n\nAll were stuck, as was the rear-wheel-drive Durango Crew sport-utility vehicle frozen in snow and ice at our house here in Cornwall. But the Subaru Outback Limited 2.5i kept going. It did not slip, get stuck or in any other way falter on the unbelievably snow-clogged streets of New York City.\n\nThank you, Subaru. We love this car.",

      "expert_review": "The newest version of the popular Subaru Outback has arrived for 2008. This is the continuation of the vehicle introduced for 1995 and billed by Subaru as the world’s first sport utility wagon.\n\nThe Outback was ahead of its time, as it’s now clear that it was the first true crossover utility vehicle – despite Toyota’s claim to have created that genre with the 1996 introduction of the RAV4.\n\nNobody knew to call either of these vehicles a “crossover” until years later, however. They were just small SUV-like vehicles built on the chassis of cars.\n\nAt the time of the Outback’s arrival, Subaru and other manufacturers were scrambling to compete in a market that was going crazy over the new truck-based sport utility vehicles, whose sales began in earnest with the introduction of the Ford Explorer in fall 1990.\n\nSubaru, with no trucks in its lineup, took its Legacy midsize sedan/wagon platform, and created a new beefy-looking wagon it dubbed the Outback.\n\nTo bolster its image as a real into-the-wilds sort of vehicle (like those popular SUVs), Subaru signed up Australian actor Paul Hogan, as “Crocodile Dundee,” to promote the Outback.\n\nIt was an overnight success, and has been outselling the Legacy sedan model ever since. The Outback name also was later given to a beefed-up Legacy sedan, and an even beefier-looking version of the smaller Impreza wagon. But for 2008, only the Legacy wagon version carries the Outback name; the sedan version is gone.\n\nThe Outback is still a worthy competitor to the other pioneering mini-crossovers, the RAV4 and the Honda CR-V, which followed the RAV onto the market for 1997. It can be argued that the Outback is by nature a better utility vehicle than the base versions of the RAV4 and CR-V, because all Outbacks come with all-wheel drive; that’s an option on the Toyota and Honda models. (Subaru includes all-wheel drive as a standard feature on all of its U.S. models.)\n\nThis year’s makeover isn’t dramatic – the vehicle still has the same body style and is instantly recognizable as an Outback\n\nBut for 2008, the Outback comes with a slightly redesigned exterior that includes new front sheetmetal, a larger grille opening, new front and rear bumpers, and new headlights and taillights.\n\nInside, there are a few changes as well, including a new instrument panel and revised seat fabrics. A telescopic steering wheel and an ignition key with built-in remote are standard now.\n\nOutback models start at $22,640 (including freight) for the base model with a five-speed manual gearbox, and $23,640 with a four-speed automatic.\n\nThose come with a normally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine (in which the cylinders are horizontally opposed, two on each side). It’s rated at 170 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nPrices range as high as $34,840 for the top-of-the-line 2.5XT Limited model with navigation and electronic-stability control, which is the version we tested.\n\nUnder the hood of this model is a turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter engine, rated at 243 horsepower and 241 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nAlso offered is a normally aspirated 3.0-liter six-cylinder boxer, with 245 horsepower and 215 foot-pounds of torque. It comes in the special L.L. Bean Outback models, priced at $32,140 with stability control only, and $34,140 with the nav system and stability control.\n\nOur turbo four, with the higher torque rating, is the most fun to drive, especially with the five-speed automatic sport-shift transmission that’s included in the price of the XT Limited.\n\nThis gearbox can do all the shifting for you, or you can put it in manual mode and shift gears yourself using the paddles on the steering wheel (without having to worry about a clutch, of course).\n\nIt’s a kick to drive, thanks to that engine, the sport transmission, and Subaru’s Intelligent Drive system, which allows for putting the vehicle’s electronic throttle control system into a sport mode for what Subaru calls “lightning-quick throttle response” for “more power sooner.”\n\nAlso included with the 2.5 XT Limited is Subaru’s best all-wheel-drive system, which includes variable torque distribution. This feature normally sends more power to the rear wheels “to enhance handling agility,” Subaru says, and “continuously adjusts power distribution in response to driving and road conditions” – automatically, with no driver input required.\n\nThe Outback has seating for up to five people; unlike the RAV4, there is no third seat offered. But the CR-V doesn’t offer a third seat, either.\n\nWith no third seat taking up space, there is a 33.5 cubic-foot cargo area.\n\nOur XT model, as well as the L.L. Bean six-cylinder versions, have unique fog lights and wheels. On the XT, the wheels are 17-inch aluminum alloy; base models come with 16-inch wheels.\n\nSafety features, besides the stability control and standard traction control, include front seat-mounted side air bags, as well as roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for both rows of seats. There are three-point seatbelts in all positions, active head restraints for the front bucket seats, and antilock brakes are standard. New for 2008 is a standard tire-pressure monitoring system.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the Outback its highest crash rating – “good” – in front-, side- and rear-impact tests.\n\nThe Outback comes with a heavy-duty four-wheel independent suspension, and the rear suspension has been redesigned to provide more ride comfort, the automaker says. Outback’s SI-Drive, or intelligent drive, system has three driver-controlled settings: “Intelligent,” for the smoothest acceleration; “Sport,” for quicker throttle response, and the “Sport Sharp” mode for the best acceleration for passing and merging.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system is not intended for serious off-road driving, as it does not come with low-range gearing. But the all-wheel drive is not just for wet or snowy roads; it’s designed to give the car great performance on dry roads as well, and is especially effective on those curvy roads.\n\nThe car has just under nine inches of ground clearance, which is good for most semi-improved gravel or dirt park roads.\n\nOther standard features on our 2.5XT Limited model included a tilt and sliding moon roof, roof rails with cross bars, dual-zone automatic climate control, an AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with six-disc in-dash changer and auxiliary input jack (for iPod), cruise control, multi-function trip computer, power driver and passenger seats, and a cargo-area cover.\n\nAlso standard was an all-weather package, which brought heated front seats and outside mirrors, as well as a windshield-wiper de-icing system.\n\nAn anti-theft alarm with engine immobilizer was standard as well.\n\nExtras on our test model included the Convenience Group 2 ($268), which added a self-dimming rearview mirror with digital compass and a rear dome reading light; all-weather floor mats ($55); and XM satellite radio ($466). Sirius satellite radio is available; Subaru is one of the few manufacturers offering a choice in satellite providers.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are on par with most vehicles in this class. The base engine has ratings of 20 miles per gallon city/27 highway with manual gearbox, or 19 city/26 highway with the four-speed automatic.\n\nOur test vehicle, with the turbo engine and five-speed automatic, was rated at 18 city/24 highway. All of these ratings are based on the new, more-realistic formula that EPA began using this year.\n\nThe tank holds 16.9 gallons of fuel, and unleaded regular is acceptable.\n\nAt a Glance: 2008 Subaru Outback\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, four- or six-cylinder, all-wheel-drive, five-passenger crossover utility vehicle.\n\nHighlights: Slightly redesigned for 2008, this is the sport utility wagon version of the Subaru Legacy midsize sedan. It comes with room for five, lots of cargo space, and many standard features, even at the base level.\n\nNegatives: Can get quite pricey for a compact crossover without a luxury brand name.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (normally aspirated or turbocharged); 3.0-liter horizontally opposed six-cylinder.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual, four-speed automatic or five-speed automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 170 horsepower/170 foot-pounds (H-4); 243 HP./241 foot-pounds (Turbo); 245 HP./215 foot-pounds (H-6).\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted, front and rear side curtain, standard.\n\nVehicle stability control: Standard on uplevel models.\n\nLength: 189.0 inches.\n\nCargo capacity: 33.5 cubic feet (behind rear seat).\n\nCurb weight: 3,350-3,625 pounds.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 16.9 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 miles per gallon city/27 highway (H-4 manual); 19 city/26 highway (H-4 automatic); 18 city/24 highway (Turbo automatic).\n\nMajor competitors: Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Chevrolet, Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, Mitsubishi Outlander, Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Mazda Tribute, Chevrolet Equinox/Pontiac Torrent/Saturn Vue.\n\nBase price: $21,995 plus $635 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $35,619 including freight and options (2.5XT Limited model with navigation).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.3 (of a possible 10).\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "This is a time of transition for Subaru. The car that evolved from the cheap but popular tin box of the early ’80s into the all-wheel-drive favorite of New Englanders in the ’90s is going hot and upscale.\n\nIts WRX Sti sports car is in a dead-on race with Mitsubishi’s Lancer Evolution for top-dog production rating among the tuner set. It offers a designer model, the Outback LL Bean edition. And who would have ever thought we’d hear a classic McIntosh sound system booming with grace and power from a Subaru?\n\nFor years, Subarus have sold in numbers disproportionate to relative population in New England because of two major factors: They were for a long time the only readily available all-wheel-drive car/station wagon on the block. And, of course, the late Ernie Boch proved a genius when he chose his New England base as the place to nurture the nascent import no one had ever heard of, over three decades ago.\n\nNow, there is far more competition. Audi is less esoteric. Ford is coming with an all-wheel-drive sedan. And Mercedes-Benz told me that one reason it decided to offer all-wheel-drive throughout virtually its entire lineup was that folks in weather-challenged areas such as New England, Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, and California’s High Sierras, who could afford Mercedes, were instead opting for Subarus.\n\nBut I wonder if Subaru, going upscale with today’s test car, the 2005 Subaru Outback 2.5XT Limited, is flying too close to the sun. I don’t know how many people want to spend 30 grand on a small Subaru. Don’t get me wrong. This is a fine car, brimming with power, luxury, and utility. But $32,500 for a small Subaru wagon?\n\nFrom its fascia-embedded fog laps, up over its slanting snout, functional hood scoop (it feeds a turbocharger), dual moon roofs, and sloped rear, it sports an aggressive-looking redesign, replete with muscular cladding and roof racks. To keep weight down, much of it is sculpted from aluminum: hood, rear gate, front bumper assembly.\n\nAnd inside  with leather seats that are Euro-lux firm, white-on-black sport gauges that are rimmed in red light, and a descending central control pod that contains audio and climate controls in easy-to-use dial and button form as well as the shifter  it is a tight and elegant package. The power seat controls offer the driver eight positions and the passenger four. The rear cargo area, with cover tray and tie-downs, makes this a perfect shopping/antiquing vehicle. For safety, air bags surround you: dual front, side curtain, and front-seat side impact.\n\nYet the big move here is to power. While the base 2.5i and 2.5i Limited models get 168 horsepower from their boxer four-cylinder engines, the 2.5 XT and 2.5 XT Limited get a derivative of the WRX Sti engine: turbocharged and offering 250 horsepower. There is also a 3.0 model with a flat six-cylinder available at similar power ratings. The 2.5 turbo was a real charger, snapping a nearly two-ton automobile forward at respectable speed and moving powerfully in passing mode.\n\nIts suspension, tuned somewhere between sport and comfort, was confusing. Flat in cornering, it had a bit of a forward-rear bounce in braking and acceleration, and was soft at the front corners at times.\n\nIts variable torque distribution system  sending power fore and aft as it senses better traction  uses a center differential. It was not totally transparent, and a couple of times I looked at the tachometer to see if the engine was fluttering, but then realized it was the torque distribution at play. But you get used to it.\n\nThe shifter, a five-speed automatic, is best used for passing in manual option mode. When stomped in automatic, it takes time to gather its thoughts on whether to downshift for fastest forward momentum. Use the manual mode  you can flick it from the steering wheel if you want, even while in automatic-drive setting  to downshift and bolt forward.\n\nSubaru is spreading its wings with cars such as this, going upscale, trying to add luxury and performance to already well-earned utility. The Outback we tested is a great step forward, but I don’t think further steps should involve escalating costs. The air up there gets too thin.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",
