      "expert_review": "The Subaru Outback has a cult-like following — and I count myself among the faithful — but like many parents, I can’t fit my kids’ three car seats in back, so it’s a no-go for my family.\n\nEnter the 2019 Subaru Ascent. The new-three row crossover SUV fills a hole in the automaker’s lineup left when the unimpressive Tribeca three-row was axed after the 2014 model year. The Ascent is Subaru’s biggest vehicle ever, designed to satisfy larger families with seven or eight seats. But it’s not just size that matters to families; comfort, safety and convenience features are key, too. Oh, and kids — and dogs, and the second-grade class gecko — are often filthy, so it can’t be too nice.\n\nRelated: 2019 Subaru Ascent Video: First Impressions\n\nI drove the Ascent at a media preview event in rural Oregon (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events) to gauge if this new Subaru has what it takes to keep up with larger families’ everyday adventures.\n\nThe Road Most Traveled\n\n\nPower comes from a new turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder; that might sound like it’s not enough for a vehicle of this size, but for the most part, it is. There’s plenty of torque and low-end power comes on strong without a hint of hesitation. It’s all you’ll have, too — unlike the Outback, a six-cylinder engine is not optional.  \n\nWhere it starts to feel underpowered is on the highway. During passing and merging or on hill climbs, it can struggle — and this is where the continuously variable automatic transmission’s unpleasant mannerisms got on my nerves. Combined with the four-cylinder, its drone is loud, coarse and unrefined, and it takes its time gathering steam for more power. An eight-speed electronic “manual mode” with steering-wheel paddle shifters is a small (and gimmicky) consolation.\n\nOn the road, the Subaru Ascent drives predictably like a three-row crossover SUV. It’s prone to a little bit of float on the highway but for the most part stays controlled and composed in corners. It doesn’t feel as agile and engaging as the Volkswagen Atlas, but its ride quality is good with bumps well-damped. Its steering feels nicely weighted, direct and natural. Overall, the Ascent would be long-drive comfortable if not for the CVT’s joyless dynamics; it’s also a touch loud in terms of wind and road noise.\n\nThe Road Least Traveled\n\n\nMost three-row SUVs spend their downtime in a garage, wheels never leaving the asphalt. Subaru’s target audience is a little more active, and the Ascent is primed for adventure.   \n\nAll-wheel drive is standard, and it’s a capable and versatile system. I drove the Ascent on sand, rocks and dirt, and it remained sure-footed. A robust 8.7 inches of ground clearance and the standard X-Mode AWD system helps; it automatically moderates engine, transmission and braking to assist with tricky conditions. For example, I climbed a steep, rocky berm, and on the way down, X-Mode’s hill descent control feature automatically moderated the brakes and throttle to assist with a smooth descent.\n\nThe all-new Subaru Ascent can tow up to 5,000 pounds, and a system that reduces trailer sway is standard. Those in the extra-adventurous camp will be happy to know that Subaru engineered the Ascent’s standard roof rails to handle the weight of a roof tent (I’m looking at you, millennials). Sadly, I didn’t get to test this claim, either.\n\nCreature Comforts\n\n\nMy parenting style is to take the path of least resistance in keeping my kids happy and alive — simple, unfussy and straightforward. The new Subaru Ascent’s cabin feels me. Its design is clean and materials utilitarian.\n\nThere’s a mix of padded and unpadded plastic in the mid-level Premium trim level I drove, and the only offensive part is the trim: A tacky faux-snakeskin-like beige plastic lines the dash and doors. On uplevel Touring models, the cabin strikes a more luxurious tone, however, with low-gloss wood paneling and leather for the seats and other surfaces.  \n\nThe controls redeem the cabin materials, however. The standard multimedia system has a 6.5-inch touchscreen, an 8-inch one is standard on higher trims and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on both. The system’s placement square on the dash makes it easy to read, and the clear menu structure and tuning and volume knobs make it easy to use.\n\nIn terms of other features, there are plenty — both standard and optional. Perhaps not most important, but among the most surprising, the Ascent comes standard with 19 cupholders; that’s a lot of juice boxes — or for my family, sequins, buttons and pebble collection bins. Other standards include a conversation mirror, tri-zone climate control, four USB ports (up to eight are available depending on trim) and spill-resistant seats.\n\nAnyone who’s ever carted around a living creature knows that spills — and other accidents — happen. They’re less of a deal with Subaru’s new standard stain-resistant cloth seats. I spilled some liquid to test them out and it beaded instantly so I could wipe it up without it soaking — and stinking — into the upholstery. \n\nOptions and features standard on higher trims include a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, 4G Wi-Fi hot spot capability (with subscription), ventilated front seats and a full-time camera-based rearview mirror handy for when the driver’s rearward view is blocked by stuff or people.\n\nWhat’s missing is a rear entertainment system. Subaru has its own version of that with the Entertainment Anywhere Package: two Subaru-configured iPads and a pair of headphones for individual streaming and gaming. Yes, I know there’s something to be said about all the kids coming together to watch a movie, but teaching my kids how to share on a road trip is not a hill I plan to die on.\n\nRoom for Extra\n\n\nThe Ascent has seating for seven on second-row captain’s chairs or eight with a bench seat. I tested a bench model and found it roomy, though the seats were harder and not as comfortable as in front. The bench slides forward and back, reclines and features five lower Latch anchors — two in the outboard seats and one in the center — making the Ascent extra-flexible when it comes to child-safety seat installation. Subaru says the Ascent’s bench will fit three car seats across, but I was unable to test that.\n\nGetting to the third row is easy thanks to second-row seats that quickly spring and slide forward, opening up a big path. The step-in height is relatively low and the doors open wide, so getting back there doesn’t require much in the way of acrobatics.\n\nThe third-row seats are even harder, but they’re not set too close to the floor as in some other third rows, so comfort is decent. They also recline, which helps. There’s room for three people back there, but each spot is narrow and best suited for kids. The third row has one set of lower Latch anchors and three top-tether anchors, though a lack of legroom would prevent a rear-facing car seat from being installed in back.\n\nBehind the third row, there’s 17.8 cubic feet of space, a bit more than the Honda Pilot but a bit less than the Volkswagen Atlas. The third-row seats fold easily in a 60/40 split for more room, and there’s also a small underfloor storage cubby for corralling littler items. \n\nSafety and Dollars\n\n\nValue and safety are two big Ascent strengths, and ones parents prioritize. The Ascent starts at $32,970 (all prices cited include destination charges). That gets you an eight-seat base model, AWD and Subaru’s EyeSight safety and driver assistance system with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. Upgrade one trim to the Premium to get standard blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nIts entry price compares with other base three-row SUVs like the Pilot ($31,895) and the Atlas ($31,675), but if you add the Ascent’s safety features and AWD, both rivals cost much more.\n\nThe Ascent is not the fanciest, quietest or most refined three-row SUV, but it’s good where it counts. It’s practical, affordable, capable and has enough goodies to keep a family’s precious cargo happy and safe. There’s no way to predict if it will garner quite the popularity of its smaller Outback sibling, but consider me a follower.  \n\nStay tuned for my full review, including fuel economy and more comparative information.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated May 21, 2018, to clarify that the Outback does not offer a V-6 engine.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Ascent is the best Subaru for families, but it’s hardly the best SUV in its class. For Subaru loyalists who’ve outgrown their Outbacks, it might be time to consider another brand.\n\nVersus the competition: Little has changed since the Ascent placed fifth out of seven SUVs in a Cars.com comparison test in late 2019. Subaru’s contender offers good visibility and standard-all-wheel-drive value, but it’s short on passenger and storage space, and its lethargic drivetrain creates more noise than confidence.\n\nNow in the fourth year of its current generation, the Ascent is a three-row SUV that seats eight (seven if you get second-row captain’s chairs, replacing the standard three-seat bench). New for 2022 is an Onyx Edition, which has darkened styling elements and Subaru’s neoprene-like StarTex upholstery; both are reminiscent of the Outback Onyx. It’s the middle of five trim levels for the 2022 Ascent (stack them up or compare the 2021 and 2022 models), all with standard AWD. We tested a 2022 Ascent Onyx Edition.\n\nRelated: Subaru Ascent: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n\nSnoozy Powertrain\n\nRather than the V-6 engines that power most three-row mid-size SUVs, the Ascent employs Subaru’s turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder, good here for 260 horsepower and 277 pounds-feet of torque. That’s stout on paper, but it’s a lackluster pairing with Subaru’s continuously variable automatic transmission. Accelerate while already in motion, and the CVT raises engine rpm and accelerates without much delay, but from a stop it’s a relaxed operator: Engine revs rise slowly — and a little behind schedule — with the press of your right foot. Throw some lead in your shoe and the drivetrain can muscle the SUV up to speed, but responsiveness feels torpid if you press the pedal anything less than three-fourths of the way. The numbers tell it all: In our seven-SUV comparison, the Ascent brought up the rear by a wide margin in the Powertrain category. Things haven’t changed appreciably since.\n\nIt might be more forgivable if the endgame were efficiency, but that’s not necessarily happening here. I observed 24.8 mpg over 385 miles of mostly highway driving with two adults, two kids and a long weekend’s worth of luggage on board. That’s a bit below the Ascent Onyx’s 26 mpg EPA highway rating. The Ascent’s combined EPA estimate of 22-23 mpg (depending on trim) is unremarkable versus AWD rivals. Shoppers who don’t need AWD should see even better numbers with the front-drive options other brands offer but Subaru doesn’t.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nSuspension tuning is deliberately soft — a welcome approach versus firmer-riding rivals like the redesigned Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer. It’s not terribly well controlled, however, with lingering body movement after rapid elevation changes; that’s something many rivals, including firmer ones, do a better job cleaning up. But the Ascent’s outright cushiness, even with 20-inch wheels, is the right idea for a family SUV, even if execution does fall short. (Lower trim levels have 18-inch wheels and higher-profile tires, which might ride softer still; we haven’t evaluated one thus equipped.)\n\nHandling is acceptable, with some initial soupiness turning into corners but quicker reflexes thereafter. Body roll is significant, and the front tires howl in protest if you really get into it, but Subaru’s AWD sends just enough power rearward to restore some balance if you add gas through tight bends. This is no Explorer — the Subaru’s most fun-to-drive rival, with the Volkswagen Atlas a distant second — but it doesn’t embarrass itself.\n\nSight Lines, Space and More\n\nSubaru has a penchant for excellent visibility: The Forester compact SUV topped the list in our comparison of rear visibility among small SUVs three times in a row, and the current-generation Impreza earned the highest visibility rating among eight compact sedans we tested head-to-head. So it goes for the Ascent, whose large windows, thin roof pillars and useful technology (top trim levels get a camera-based rearview mirror) make sight lines excellent.\n\nIt’s hard, however, to get excited about too much else inside. Dashboard styling feels chaotic, with undersized controls and designed-by-committee modularity. Missing features — even as options — include a height-adjustable passenger seat, wireless smartphone integration and anything larger than an 8-inch touchscreen; many competitors offer one or more of those extras, with touchscreens as big as 12.3 inches. Subaru’s 19 cupholders mean second- and third-row passengers can enjoy bladder-bursting volumes of Mr. Pibb or umpteen storage nooks, but the all-important open storage in the front console is too small for family duty.\n\nSize is a nagging issue elsewhere, too. The front seats are spacious, but the second-row captain’s chairs feel too small, with modest seating height that could leave some adults’ knees uncomfortably elevated. In the third row, raised stadium seating makes for the opposite problem: While passengers’ knees will be in better shape back there than in most slammed-to-the-floor third rows, they’ll pay the price in headroom. Folks, it doesn’t have to be this way: SUVs like the Atlas, Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride have adult-friendly second and third rows.\n\nOur independent accounting of cargo volume found 23.6 cubic feet behind the Ascent’s second row — short of the Toyota Highlander (24.0 cubic feet), Palisade (26.2) and Atlas (29.9). The Ascent’s volume behind the third row (10.3 cubic feet) compares more favorably with the class. See our cargo space results for all mid-size three-row SUVs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nShould You Buy an Ascent?\n\nStandard features for 2022 include tri-zone automatic climate control, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, four USB ports, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering. Climb the trims and you can get two more USB ports, StarTex or leather upholstery, power seats with heating and ventilation, and a panoramic moonroof. That’s all typical fare in this class. The same goes for the Ascent’s excellent crash-test scores — commendable, to be sure, but less differentiating than they once were (the Highlander, Palisade and Explorer also earned top scores).\n\nPricing for the 2022 Ascent ranges from $33,420 for a base model to $46,570 for a factory-loaded Ascent Touring, the top trim level. For families needing all-weather capability, that’s a strong value across the board. The base model considerably undercuts rivals that charge extra for AWD, and even a factory-loaded Ascent avoids spiraling into the $50,000-plus stratosphere, where a few others easily reach. \n\nThat, plus the Ascent’s excellent visibility, form the best arguments for its consideration, but you’ll sacrifice a lot in terms of drivability and space. Judging by sales popularity — where the Ascent ranks as the least popular of Subaru’s SUVs and a bit player in the three-row class — not many consumers are taking the deal.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2020?\n2019 Subaru Ascent: 5 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Subaru Ascent?\nSubaru Ascent Vs.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: While the 2024 Subaru Ascent might appeal to brand loyalists, its snug interior, lackluster fuel economy and frustrating tech prove the three-row SUV is in need of an overhaul.\n\nVersus the competition: The Ascent was observably smaller inside and had worse observed fuel economy than the other three-row SUVs in our recent comparison test, but its excellent visibility, torquey turbocharged powertrain and second-row amenities were highlights. \n\nWe generally like Subarus around here. Their slightly quirky, somewhat irreverent approach to mass-market transportation makes them just a skosh more interesting to operate and live with than much of their competition, yet they don’t sacrifice the essentials, like reliability and functionality. We like Subies small and we like Subies tall, but after driving the 2024 Subaru Ascent Touring, it turns out we don’t like ‘em all.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2024?\n\nMaybe that’s a bit strong. We don’t dislike Subaru’s biggest SUV, but we do think it has some areas in need of improvement, especially compared with six other three-row mid-size heavy hitters we put it up against recently in a direct comparison test. The biggest issue our test judges had was actually the opposite of big: Despite its clear market position, the Ascent feels a whole class size smaller than its competition.\n\n2024 Subaru Ascent Touring AWD | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nDiminutive Dimensions\n\n“Feels” is the key word here. On paper, the Ascent does sit near the bottom in its class, but it matches some rivals for exterior length and surpasses others in height. It’s the Subaru’s roughly 2-inch width deficit versus most of the field that shrinks it the most and puts the squeeze on its occupants. The Ascent’s first-, second- and third-row comfort all scored the lowest of any SUV in our test. Even so, the Ascent’s second row is far from unusable, though larger adults will find it cozy; the compacted third row, however, is somewhat cruel for adults. Also frustrating is a lack of in-cabin storage for smaller items.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThat’s the sour. Here’s the sweet: For those who occasionally need a third row — or just flat out like having one — the Ascent might be just right size-wise. Visibility, a Subaru hallmark, is also among the best in the class, and there’s oodles of second-row amenities, including USB-A and USB-C charge ports and a traditional household outlet. Also, parents can scream at kids or unruly relatives more effectively via an available Cabin Connect system, which is always a bonus.\n\nPleasant Power\n\nThe Ascent’s standard turbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four engine is reassuringly torquey, and it’s absolutely up for the job of hauling a full house. That’s the most important function of any three-row SUV, and the Ascent’s 260 horsepower and 277 pounds-feet of torque pull (reasonably) hard; outfitted properly, it can tow up to 5,000 pounds. But there’s a cost: While the Ascent had one of the smallest engines in our comparison test, it proved the thirstiest in our real-world long-distance fuel-economy drive, where our observed gas mileage was only 22.9 mpg.\n\nTricky Tech \n\nAlso frustrating was this Subaru’s active-safety tech. The camera-based EyeSight suite of safety features is generally useful, but most judges found the Ascent’s lane keep assist and driver attention monitor intrusive. Both can be disabled without much fuss, but toggling off the former lights an amber warning light on the dash that stays on no matter what. Beyond that, the Ascent’s collision warning system was a mite too aggressive.\n\nThere were some things we liked on the tech front, including all-wheel drive and X-Mode, both of which are standard. X-Mode is Subaru’s trademark off-road mode, which is useful in any low-traction situation. Also nice was the Ascent’s pricing: Our top Touring trim’s $49,931 as-tested price was the lowest in our comparison test, coming in around $3,300 less than the next most affordable model, a Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\nShould You Buy a 2024 Subaru Ascent?\n\nMany of our complaints about the Ascent are amplified in the presence of its larger direct competition, but if you view its smaller footprint as an advantage rather than a liability — whether for parking, maneuverability or other reasons — it might be your pick of the three-row mid-size SUV litter. It’s unclear when the next-generation Ascent will debut, but if it follows current industry trends, it’ll be bigger when it does.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich 3-Row SUV Has the Best Real-World MPG?\nVideo: Which 3-Row SUV Has the Most Cargo Space?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Subaru Ascent?\nSubaru Ascent Rolls Into 2024 With $35,490 Starting Price\nShop for a 2024 Subaru Ascent\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Ascent?\n\nThe 2023 Subaru Ascent is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seats, standard all-wheel drive and a 260-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Having all-wheel drive on every trim gives the Ascent an edge over rivals like the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Ascent?\n\nFor the 2023 model year, the Subaru Ascent gets a subtle exterior-styling makeover, improved active-safety features (including a more advanced adaptive cruise control system), and that larger touchscreen to replace the previous 6.5- and 8-inch screens. Also, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are newly standard.     \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Ascent Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n11.6-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nSecond-row bench \nSatellite radio\nFour USB ports\nRear-seat reminder\nTri-zone climate control\nAdaptive cruise control\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:  \n\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nRear privacy glass\nPower liftgate\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nLeather upholstery\nPanoramic moonroof\nNavigation\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Ascent?\n\nThe good news for SUV shoppers is that competition is fierce among mid-size models with three rows of seating. Standard AWD certainly boosts the Ascent’s appeal, and its price is also lower than many direct competitors (we’re looking at you, Honda Pilot and Jeep Grand Cherokee L). The third row remains snug and is best for kids, however, and performance from the Ascent’s turbo four-cylinder is underwhelming — the turbo four-cylinder lacks verve when you need quick acceleration. In the plus column, the Ascent comes with many active-safety features, records excellent scores in crash tests and features a standard 11.6-inch touchscreen. While the slightly more aggressive exterior look is welcome, the fitment of the new larger standard touchscreen is the most noteworthy addition to Subaru’s largest sport ute for 2023.",

      "expert_review": "The Subaru Ascent looks like a plumped-up version of the Outback wagon and fills the hole in the automaker’s lineup left when the unimpressive Tribeca three-row was axed after the 2014 model year. Compare the Ascent with the Tribeca.\n\nThe Ascent is Subaru’s biggest vehicle ever, designed to satisfy larger families with its seven or eight seats. It competes against the likes of the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas; see them compared. Trim levels for 2018 include base, Premium, Limited and Touring.\n\nCreature Comforts\n\nIt’s not just size that matters to families; comfort, safety and convenience features are also key. Yet kids — and dogs and the second-grade class gecko — are often filthy, so it can’t be too nice. The Ascent deftly toes that line, like a clean toddler teetering cheerfully on the edge of a muddy puddle. Its cabin is simple, unfussy and straightforward, with a plain design and utilitarian materials.\n\nThere’s a mix of padded and unpadded plastic in the Ascent Premium I drove. It’s a mid-range trim level, and its only offensive part is the trim: Tacky beige plastic, reminiscent of faux snakeskin, lines the dash and doors. On the highest Touring trim, the cabin strikes a more luxurious tone, with low-gloss wood trim and leather for the seats and other surfaces.\n\nIn lower trims, the controls redeem the cabin materials. The standard multimedia system has a 6.5-inch touchscreen, while an 8-inch one is standard on higher trims; Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on both. The system’s placement square on the dash makes it easy to read, and the clear menu structure and tuning and volume knobs make it easy to use.\n\nIn terms of other features, there are plenty — both standard and optional. Not most important, but maybe most surprising, the Ascent comes standard with 19 cupholders. That’s a lot of juice boxes — or in my family, sequin-, button- and pebble-collection bins. Other standard features include a conversation mirror (a wide-angle mirror above the rearview mirror that lets the driver see all seats), tri-zone climate control, four USB ports (up to eight are available depending on trim) and spill-resistant seats.\n\nAnyone who’s ever carted around a living creature knows that spills — and other accidents — happen. They’re less of a big deal with Subaru’s new, standard stain-resistant cloth seats. I spilled some liquid to test them out and it beaded instantly so I could wipe it up without it soaking into — and stinking up — the upholstery. None of the Ascent’s competitors offer anything like it.\n\nFeatures standard or available on higher trims include a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, 4G Wi-Fi hot spot (with subscription), ventilated front seats and a full-time rearview camera — handy for when the driver’s rear view is blocked by stuff or people.\n\nThere’s also an available entertainment system: the Entertainment Anywhere Package, which consists of two Subaru-configured iPads and a pair of headphones for individual streaming and gaming. Yes, I know there’s something to be said about all the kids coming together to watch a movie on a single screen, but teaching my kids how to share on a road trip is not a hill I plan to die on.\n\nRoom for Extra\n\nThe Subaru Outback has a cultlike following, and I count myself among the faithful. Like many parents, however, I can’t fit my kids’ three car seats in back, so it’s a no-go for my family. But both my kids and their friends would fit in the Ascent. It has seating for seven with second-row captain’s chairs or eight with a bench seat in the second row.\n\nI tested a bench model and found it roomy, though the seat was harder and not as comfortable as in front. The bench slides forward and back and reclines, and it features five lower Latch anchors — a pair in each of the outboard seats and one anchor in the center — making the Ascent extra-flexible when it comes to child-safety seat installation. Subaru says the Ascent’s bench will fit three car seats across, but I was unable to test that. The Pilot and Atlas easily accommodate three car seats in the second row; we have not yet tested a Highlander equipped with a second-row bench.\n\nGetting to the third row is easy thanks to second-row seats that quickly spring and slide forward, opening up a big path. Step-in height is relatively low and the doors open wide, so getting back there doesn’t require much in the way of acrobatics.\n\nThe third-row seat cushions are even harder than the second row’s, but they’re not set too close to the floor as they are in some third rows, so comfort is decent. They also recline, which helps. There’s room for three people back there, but each spot is narrow and best suited for kids.\n\nThe third row has one set of lower Latch anchors and three top tether anchors, though a lack of legroom would prevent a rear-facing car seat from being installed in back. By the numbers, the Ascent’s third row is slightly roomier than the Highlander’s but not quite as spacious as the Atlas’ or Pilot’s.\n\nThere’s 17.8 cubic feet of space behind the third row. That’s a bit more than the Pilot and much more than the Highlander, but a smidge less than the Atlas. The third-row seats fold easily in a 60/40 split to create more cargo room, and there’s also a small underfloor storage cubby for corralling littler items.\n\nWith the third row down, the Ascent again offers more room than the Pilot and Highlander but can’t quite match the Atlas.\n\nThe Road Most Traveled\n\nPower comes from a new turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. That might sound too small for a vehicle this size, but it does the job for the most part. There’s plenty of torque, and low-end power comes on strong without a hint of hesitation. Where the Ascent’s engine starts to feel underpowered is on the highway. During passing and merging or on hill climbs, it can struggle — and this is where the continuously variable automatic transmission’s unpleasant mannerisms got on my nerves. Combined with the four-cylinder, its drone is loud, coarse and unrefined, and it takes its time gathering steam for more power. An eight-speed electronic “manual mode” with steering-wheel paddle shifters is a small (and gimmicky) consolation.\n\nThis engine is all you can get in the Ascent — unlike the Outback, which has an optional six-cylinder engine. Though power ratings never tell the whole story, it’s worth noting that the Ascent’s only engine is more powerful, at 260 horsepower, than the standard four-cylinders in the Atlas and Highlander, but slightly less powerful than the Atlas’ optional V-6 and the Pilot’s standard one. The Highlander’s optional V-6 tops them all at 295 hp.\n\nOn the road, the Ascent drives predictably, which is to say, like a three-row SUV. It’s prone to a little bit of float on the highway, but for the most part, it stays controlled and composed in corners. It doesn’t feel as agile and engaging as the Volkswagen Atlas, but its ride quality is good, with bumps well-damped. Its steering feels nicely weighted, direct and natural. Overall, the Ascent would be long-drive comfortable if not for the CVT’s joyless behavior — and it’s also a touch loud in terms of wind and road noise.\n\nSome turbo engines prefer premium gas, but Subaru says regular is just fine for the Ascent. Base models are EPA-rated at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, which slightly lags behind a base Atlas (22/26/24 mpg) and bests a Highlander (20/24/22 mpg) — both with front-wheel drive as opposed to the Ascent’s all-wheel drive. It represents gains over the old Subaru Tribeca, as well, which was EPA-rated at 16/21/18 mpg despite being smaller. The V-6-only Pilot in base front-wheel-drive trim is rated 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nThe Road Least Traveled\n\nMost three-row SUVs’ wheels never leave the pavement. Subaru’s target audience is a little more active, and the Ascent is primed for adventure.\n\nI drove the Ascent on sand, rocks and dirt, and it remained sure-footed; a robust 8.7 inches of ground clearance and the standard X-Mode AWD system help. X-Mode is a capable and versatile system that automatically moderates engine, transmission and braking to assist with tricky conditions. For example, after I climbed a steep, rocky berm, X-Mode’s hill descent control feature automatically moderated the brakes and throttle on the way down to assist with a smooth descent.\n\nWhen equipped with an available Class III trailer hitch, the Ascent can tow up to 2,000 pounds with the base trim level and up to 5,000 pounds with the higher trims. A system that reduces trailer sway is standard. Those in the extra-adventurous camp will be happy to know that Subaru engineered the Ascent’s standard roof rails to handle the weight of a roof tent (I’m looking at you, millennials). Sadly, I didn’t get to test this claim, either.\n\nSafety and Dollars\n\nValue and safety are two big strengths of the Ascent — and they’re attributes parents prioritize. The Ascent starts at $32,970 (all prices cited include destination charges). That gets you an eight-seat base model with AWD and Subaru’s EyeSight safety and driver assistance system, which includes forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. Go up one trim level to the Premium and you’ll get standard blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nAt a glance, the Ascent’s entry price seems in line with those of the Pilot ($31,895), Highlander ($32,275) and Atlas ($31,675), but once you account for the safety features and AWD included in its price, the base Subaru is much more affordable.\n\nThe Ascent is not the fanciest, quietest or most refined three-row SUV, but it’s good where it counts. It’s practical, affordable, capable and has enough goodies to keep a family’s precious cargo happy and safe. There’s no way to predict if it will garner quite the popularity of its smaller Outback sibling, but consider me a follower.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Subaru Ascent looks like a plumped-up version of the Outback wagon and fills the hole in the automaker’s lineup left when the unimpressive Tribeca three-row was axed after the 2014 model year. Compare the Ascent with the Tribeca.\n\nThe Ascent is Subaru’s biggest vehicle ever, designed to satisfy larger families with its seven or eight seats. It competes against the likes of the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas; see them compared. Trim levels for 2018 include base, Premium, Limited and Touring.\n\nCreature Comforts\n\nIt’s not just size that matters to families; comfort, safety and convenience features are also key. Yet kids — and dogs and the second-grade class gecko — are often filthy, so it can’t be too nice. The Ascent deftly toes that line, like a clean toddler teetering cheerfully on the edge of a muddy puddle. Its cabin is simple, unfussy and straightforward, with a plain design and utilitarian materials.\n\nThere’s a mix of padded and unpadded plastic in the Ascent Premium I drove. It’s a mid-range trim level, and its only offensive part is the trim: Tacky beige plastic, reminiscent of faux snakeskin, lines the dash and doors. On the highest Touring trim, the cabin strikes a more luxurious tone, with low-gloss wood trim and leather for the seats and other surfaces.\n\nIn lower trims, the controls redeem the cabin materials. The standard multimedia system has a 6.5-inch touchscreen, while an 8-inch one is standard on higher trims; Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on both. The system’s placement square on the dash makes it easy to read, and the clear menu structure and tuning and volume knobs make it easy to use.\n\nIn terms of other features, there are plenty — both standard and optional. Not most important, but maybe most surprising, the Ascent comes standard with 19 cupholders. That’s a lot of juice boxes — or in my family, sequin-, button- and pebble-collection bins. Other standard features include a conversation mirror (a wide-angle mirror above the rearview mirror that lets the driver see all seats), tri-zone climate control, four USB ports (up to eight are available depending on trim) and spill-resistant seats.\n\nAnyone who’s ever carted around a living creature knows that spills — and other accidents — happen. They’re less of a big deal with Subaru’s new, standard stain-resistant cloth seats. I spilled some liquid to test them out and it beaded instantly so I could wipe it up without it soaking into — and stinking up — the upholstery. None of the Ascent’s competitors offer anything like it.\n\nFeatures standard or available on higher trims include a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, 4G Wi-Fi hot spot (with subscription), ventilated front seats and a full-time rearview camera — handy for when the driver’s rear view is blocked by stuff or people.\n\nThere’s also an available entertainment system: the Entertainment Anywhere Package, which consists of two Subaru-configured iPads and a pair of headphones for individual streaming and gaming. Yes, I know there’s something to be said about all the kids coming together to watch a movie on a single screen, but teaching my kids how to share on a road trip is not a hill I plan to die on.\n\nRoom for Extra\n\nThe Subaru Outback has a cultlike following, and I count myself among the faithful. Like many parents, however, I can’t fit my kids’ three car seats in back, so it’s a no-go for my family. But both my kids and their friends would fit in the Ascent. It has seating for seven with second-row captain’s chairs or eight with a bench seat in the second row.\n\nI tested a bench model and found it roomy, though the seat was harder and not as comfortable as in front. The bench slides forward and back and reclines, and it features five lower Latch anchors — a pair in each of the outboard seats and one anchor in the center — making the Ascent extra-flexible when it comes to child-safety seat installation. Subaru says the Ascent’s bench will fit three car seats across, but I was unable to test that. The Pilot and Atlas easily accommodate three car seats in the second row; we have not yet tested a Highlander equipped with a second-row bench.\n\nGetting to the third row is easy thanks to second-row seats that quickly spring and slide forward, opening up a big path. Step-in height is relatively low and the doors open wide, so getting back there doesn’t require much in the way of acrobatics.\n\nThe third-row seat cushions are even harder than the second row’s, but they’re not set too close to the floor as they are in some third rows, so comfort is decent. They also recline, which helps. There’s room for three people back there, but each spot is narrow and best suited for kids.\n\nThe third row has one set of lower Latch anchors and three top tether anchors, though a lack of legroom would prevent a rear-facing car seat from being installed in back. By the numbers, the Ascent’s third row is slightly roomier than the Highlander’s but not quite as spacious as the Atlas’ or Pilot’s.\n\nThere’s 17.8 cubic feet of space behind the third row. That’s a bit more than the Pilot and much more than the Highlander, but a smidge less than the Atlas. The third-row seats fold easily in a 60/40 split to create more cargo room, and there’s also a small underfloor storage cubby for corralling littler items.\n\nWith the third row down, the Ascent again offers more room than the Pilot and Highlander but can’t quite match the Atlas.\n\nThe Road Most Traveled\n\nPower comes from a new turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. That might sound too small for a vehicle this size, but it does the job for the most part. There’s plenty of torque, and low-end power comes on strong without a hint of hesitation. Where the Ascent’s engine starts to feel underpowered is on the highway. During passing and merging or on hill climbs, it can struggle — and this is where the continuously variable automatic transmission’s unpleasant mannerisms got on my nerves. Combined with the four-cylinder, its drone is loud, coarse and unrefined, and it takes its time gathering steam for more power. An eight-speed electronic “manual mode” with steering-wheel paddle shifters is a small (and gimmicky) consolation.\n\nThis engine is all you can get in the Ascent — unlike the Outback, which has an optional six-cylinder engine. Though power ratings never tell the whole story, it’s worth noting that the Ascent’s only engine is more powerful, at 260 horsepower, than the standard four-cylinders in the Atlas and Highlander, but slightly less powerful than the Atlas’ optional V-6 and the Pilot’s standard one. The Highlander’s optional V-6 tops them all at 295 hp.\n\nOn the road, the Ascent drives predictably, which is to say, like a three-row SUV. It’s prone to a little bit of float on the highway, but for the most part, it stays controlled and composed in corners. It doesn’t feel as agile and engaging as the Volkswagen Atlas, but its ride quality is good, with bumps well-damped. Its steering feels nicely weighted, direct and natural. Overall, the Ascent would be long-drive comfortable if not for the CVT’s joyless behavior — and it’s also a touch loud in terms of wind and road noise.\n\nSome turbo engines prefer premium gas, but Subaru says regular is just fine for the Ascent. Base models are EPA-rated at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, which slightly lags behind a base Atlas (22/26/24 mpg) and bests a Highlander (20/24/22 mpg) — both with front-wheel drive as opposed to the Ascent’s all-wheel drive. It represents gains over the old Subaru Tribeca, as well, which was EPA-rated at 16/21/18 mpg despite being smaller. The V-6-only Pilot in base front-wheel-drive trim is rated 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nThe Road Least Traveled\n\nMost three-row SUVs’ wheels never leave the pavement. Subaru’s target audience is a little more active, and the Ascent is primed for adventure.\n\nI drove the Ascent on sand, rocks and dirt, and it remained sure-footed; a robust 8.7 inches of ground clearance and the standard X-Mode AWD system help. X-Mode is a capable and versatile system that automatically moderates engine, transmission and braking to assist with tricky conditions. For example, after I climbed a steep, rocky berm, X-Mode’s hill descent control feature automatically moderated the brakes and throttle on the way down to assist with a smooth descent.\n\nWhen equipped with an available Class III trailer hitch, the Ascent can tow up to 2,000 pounds with the base trim level and up to 5,000 pounds with the higher trims. A system that reduces trailer sway is standard. Those in the extra-adventurous camp will be happy to know that Subaru engineered the Ascent’s standard roof rails to handle the weight of a roof tent (I’m looking at you, millennials). Sadly, I didn’t get to test this claim, either.\n\nSafety and Dollars\n\nValue and safety are two big strengths of the Ascent — and they’re attributes parents prioritize. The Ascent starts at $32,970 (all prices cited include destination charges). That gets you an eight-seat base model with AWD and Subaru’s EyeSight safety and driver assistance system, which includes forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. Go up one trim level to the Premium and you’ll get standard blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nAt a glance, the Ascent’s entry price seems in line with those of the Pilot ($31,895), Highlander ($32,275) and Atlas ($31,675), but once you account for the safety features and AWD included in its price, the base Subaru is much more affordable.\n\nThe Ascent is not the fanciest, quietest or most refined three-row SUV, but it’s good where it counts. It’s practical, affordable, capable and has enough goodies to keep a family’s precious cargo happy and safe. There’s no way to predict if it will garner quite the popularity of its smaller Outback sibling, but consider me a follower.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Subaru Ascent?\n\nThe Subaru Ascent is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seats, standard all-wheel drive and a 260-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine coupled with a continuously variable automatic transmission. It seats seven or eight people, depending on whether the buyer chooses a second-row bench seat or captain’s chairs. The Ascent’s rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot, Jeep Grand Cherokee L, Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Grand Highlander and Kia Telluride.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Subaru Ascent?\n\nThe Ascent loses its base trim level for 2025, which raises its starting price by about $5,500. The lineup now starts with the Premium trim, which comes standard with heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. A Bronze Edition trim (essentially a bronze-trim appearance package for the Limited trim) and a top-line Onyx Edition Touring trim also join the line.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Subaru Ascent Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.6-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nSecond-row bench seat\nSatellite radio\nFour USB ports\nRear-seat reminder\nTri-zone climate control\nAdaptive cruise control\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nRear privacy glass\nPower liftgate\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nLeather upholstery\nPanoramic moonroof\nNavigation\nShould I Buy the 2025 Subaru Ascent?\n\nThe good news for SUV shoppers is that competition is fierce among mid-size models with three rows of seats. Standard AWD certainly boosts the Ascent’s appeal, but its third row is snug and the turbo four-cylinder lacks verve when you need quick acceleration. In the plus column, the Ascent comes with many active-safety features, earns excellent scores in crash tests and features a standard 11.6-inch touchscreen.",
