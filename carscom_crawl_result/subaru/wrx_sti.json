      "expert_review": "The 2015 Subaru WRX STI may satisfy a core group of performance purists, but others will see a tarted-up sport compact that burns more cash than rubber.\n\nSubaru finally redesigned its bat-out-of-hell performance compact, the Subaru WRX STI, along the lines of the fourth-gen Impreza that’s been in dealerships since late 2011. Like before, however, this is one pricey creature. The toned-down WRX starts at $8,200 less, and unless you spend weekends at the racetrack, the STI’s extra performance doesn’t seem worthwhile.\n\nLike the WRX, the WRX STI comes only as a sedan even though there’s also an Impreza hatchback. Click here to stack them up or here to compare the WRX STI with its predecessor. Click here to read our review of the WRX, which we cover separately in the Research section.\n\nThe WRX STI comes in base, Launch Edition and Limited trims; compare them here. All-wheel drive and a turbocharged four-cylinder are standard; a six-speed manual is the sole transmission. We tested a well-optioned WRX STI Limited.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLED headlights, optional on the WRX, are standard on the STI, which also gets side-mirror turn signals. Apart from that, differences between the WRX and WRX STI are few up front. Both have functional hood scoops and a pulled-forward nose, with squared-off bumpers and aggressive fog light portals — clear differentiators against the Impreza’s cheerier expression.\n\nIn back, the STI’s hulking rear wing remains. Save a toned-down spoiler option in 2007, it’s been on the STI sedan since the car showed up in the U.S. 11 model years and two generations ago. Subaru needs to bring back 2007; this wing is just silly.\n\nThe automaker could also borrow some tailpipe restraint from the STI’s earlier days. Impreza tailpipes have multiplied like rabbits, and today’s WRX and WRX STI both have four pipes apiece. They dangle in a sea of unconvincing faux carbon fiber, with the wing towering above on the STI. Hey, Subaru: The ’90s called, and my high school wants its cars back.\n\nSTIs have 18-inch BBS alloy wheels and P245/40R18 summer tires, versus the WRX’s P234/45R17s. In our hands at the tail end of a rough winter around our Chicago offices, our STI had winter tires.\n\nHow It Drives\nI hate to break it to you, but the Subaru WRX STI doesn’t feel that much quicker than the WRX. Fire up the STI’s 305-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder, and the car hurtles ahead once you pound past some serious turbo lag. The six-speed manual has a tallish shifter I’d trade for the rear-drive BRZ’s shorter unit, but the throws are short and gears feel evenly spaced all the way through 6th. (Launch Editions have an even shorter-throw shifter.) An SI-Drive controller — Subaru Intelligent Drive — offers three switchable modes of accelerator progression, but even in the sharpest mode the STI retains the old-school lag of yesterday’s turbos. So does the turbo four-cylinder in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, which is perhaps the only direct STI competitor. But that car hasn’t been updated since the 2008 model year. Hint, hint.\n\nWhy? Consider the hardware. The Subaru WRX STI’s 2.5-liter engine carries over from the last STI but for a reprogrammed engine control unit that Subaru says quickens accelerator response. It’s still a port-injected four-cylinder and single-scroll turbocharger, and though it beats the WRX by 37 hp and 32 lb-ft of torque, the torque peaks at a comparatively zingy 4,000 rpm versus the WRX’s fat 2,000-5,200 plateau. The WRX, by contrast, uses a direct-injected 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a twin-scroll turbo — a combination that delivers more boost and higher compression.\n\nThe results are clear. Pound through the gears and the STI has more absolute power; our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and the quarter-mile in 13.2 with their STI, versus 5.4 and 13.9 seconds, respectively, in a stick-shift WRX. But in everyday driving — even for lead foots — the extra oomph is less usable than the numbers suggest.\n\nSubaru’s all-wheel-drive system gets a driver-adjustable center differential in the STI, which can divert power from a 50/50 percent (front/rear) split to a heavy rear bias, with three automatic and six manual settings that affect power apportionment and intervention levels for the locking center diff. Full-auto mode introduces hints of understeer, but the tail comes into play if you tromp on the gas midcorner. It’s easier to drift the STI in the rear-biased modes, particularly with those manual settings. Driven in the most manual setting (which dials back center differential intervention the most), the STI’s driftability evokes a rear-drive car. The steering plays into the fun; turn it a few degrees, and the nose darts that way with instinctive precision. Indeed, the steering ratio is 13.0:1 versus the WRX’s slower 14.5:1 ratio; it’s 2.5 turns lock-to-lock versus the WRX’s 2.8 turns, and (performance purists rejoice) eschews the electric power steering in the Impreza and WRX for an old-fashioned hydraulic setup. It all pays off in excellent feedback.\n\nBody roll, which is noticeable in the WRX, is quelled here — a result of the STI’s unique, inverted-strut suspension, which Subaru says improves cornering. It’s a similar setup to the prior STI, albeit with thicker strut tubes and new bushings.\n\nOur tester’s winter tires held decent lateral traction, but heavy braking introduced early intervention from the antilock brakes. Those brakes employ Brembo four-piston calipers and 13-inch front discs; the rears are 12.4 inches and use two-piston calipers, and all four are ventilated.\n\nRide quality is good — a crucial difference from the Lancer Evolution GSR. (Compare the cars here.) The STI rides much like regular WRXs, with the sort of highway isolation you wouldn’t expect from a high-performance compact. Manhole covers and other ruts introduce some chop, but the overall setup suits daily driving.\n\nInterior\nThe Subaru WRX STI’s bolstered seats have red and black leather bolsters with Alcantara center inserts; Launch Editions get blue bolsters, while the Limited has full leather. Our tester’s seats proved comfortable and supportive, and cabin materials are mostly impressive for this class. The backseat has sufficient room for adults, and the Impreza’s low dashboard and tall windows carry over for excellent visibility — save the STI’s rear wing, which bisects the view out back.\n\nThe Subaru WRX’s flat-bottom steering wheel carries over to the STI, but controls for Subaru’s SI-Drive move from the wheel to just behind the gearshift; I liked the wheel location better. Dual-zone automatic climate control is exclusive to the WRX STI, so if that helps you justify the purchase to a temperature-fussy spouse, go nuts.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA CD stereo with HD radio, USB/iPod connectivity and Bluetooth phone/audio streaming is standard. Harman Kardon premium audio is optional, as is a navigation system with a 6.1-inch screen. Avoid the navigation system, which ditches the head unit’s tuning knob and physical presets for tiny on-screen buttons and outdated graphics.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk volume improves to 12 cubic feet from last year’s 11.3 cubic feet. Still, that’s on the small side for a class where some small-car trunks exceed 15 cubic feet. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard.\n\nSafety\nWith top scores in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the WRX STI is an IIHS Top Safety Pick. A backup camera is standard, but lane departure, blind spot and forward collision warning systems — fast becoming available among compacts — are MIA. That’s odd, given that Subaru’s EyeSight system (available on the Forester, Outback and Legacy) packages most of those features and ranks among the best active-safety systems available.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features and here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions in the Impreza sedan.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThere’s a stick-shift, turbocharged Subaru sedan out there with stout power, drift-happy handling and a compliant ride. It’s EPA-rated at 24 mpg combined. It recommends premium gas and starts right around $27,000 with destination.\n\nIt’s the 2015 Subaru WRX.\n\nThe Subaru WRX STI is 119 pounds heavier, gets a miserable 19 mpg, the engine requires premium gas and starts north of $35,000. Subaru throws in a few extra creature comforts — heated partial-leather-trimmed seats, dual-zone climate, LED headlights — but the sum total does little to narrow the gap. Add full leather, a moonroof, navigation and keyless access, and the car tops out near $41,000 — luxury-car money for a performance-modified compact with an absurd rear wing.\n\nMost of the STI’s premium goes toward performance. A better suspension and the trick center differential add incremental driftability and crisper cornering; the drivetrain packs extra thrust if you push the car hard. If you plan to take your Subie to the track, the Subaru WRX STI makes a case. Apart from that, we’d stick with a WRX.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "For fans of performance cars, the last couple of years have been a breath of fresh air. Sure, we lost the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution to the scrap heap of history, but we gained the Ford Focus RS in 2016, and the Honda Civic Type R finally made its U.S. debut as a 2018 model. Those two, along with the Volkswagen Golf R, are a strong set of competitors (compare them here) that really give the WRX STI a run for its money.\n\nThe Focus RS is the most performance-driven, the Type R is incredibly fun and agile, and the Golf R combines interior quality with everyday livability and good performance credentials of its own. So where does that leave the 2018 STI?\n\nChanges for 2018\n\nThe 2018 WRX STI gets a slew of minor updates for the new model year that are geared to enhance performance and styling and address the STI’s interior quality issues. The driver-controlled center differential is now fully electronic, the suspension has been retuned and the Brembo brake system now features larger cross-drilled, vented discs front and rear, as well as six-piston front-calipers (versus the four-piston calipers from 2017) and a yellow finish on the calipers, as well.\n\nThere is a new front grille and 19-inch alloy wheels to enhance styling, as well as updated LED headlights that are steering-responsive (they pan left and right as you steer). The styling changes are hard to pick out; you’d have to line up the 2018 STI with last year’s side by side to really tell them apart. Inside, there are updated cabin materials and the option of a new pair of Recaro performance front seats. Compare the 2018 WRX STI with last year’s model.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe STI’s beating heart is a 305-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine that makes 295 lb-ft pounds-feet of torque. There is only one transmission, a six-speed manual. A symmetrical all-wheel-drive system is standard, and it features an electronic limited-slip center differential, helical gear-type limited-slip differential up front and a Torsen torque-sensing limited-slip differential in the rear.\n\nThere is also a good amount of driver customizability, with three different drive modes (Intelligent, Sport and Sport Sharp) and six manual differential lock control settings to change how power is distributed between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe three different drive modes change up throttle response quite drastically. At low engine speeds, the STI is quite docile — maximum horsepower isn’t until 6,000 rpm, and peak torque doesn’t come until 4,000 rpm. The Intelligent setting lets you sit in the lower rpm, which makes the car easier to manage in traffic or slower situations. But flip into the other two settings and the engine moves up in the rev range aggressively, building up power in a rush.\n\nWhile I liked the throttle response, it also highlighted my biggest problem with the WRX STI: its clutch and shifter. I’ve always had problems with Subaru clutches, which are heavy, feel inconsistent on the catch and are hard to drive smoothly. I can usually figure out a clutch within a few days with a car, but after a week with the STI, I was still a little flummoxed (as were my passengers). The shifter action feels similarly sloppy, especially compared with the short-throw tightness of the Focus RS and Civic Type R.\n\nHowever, if you push the STI, it remains a rewarding experience. The suspension tuning is a bit stiff for everyday use, but it pays off when you’re moving quicker. The front-to-rear balance is quite good, and if you’re driving aggressively, the lack of gearbox smoothness is less noticeable. The STI’s best trait is how it puts down power: The all-wheel drive works hard. I was also a fan of the STI’s power steering; instead of an electric system, it has a good old-fashioned hydraulic assist that offers tons of feedback. It’s a bit twitchy on center, which could be because those electric systems I’ve gotten accustomed to smooth out some of that feedback, but I’ll trade that for the system’s upsides.\n\nThe STI’s fuel-economy figures are not good at an EPA-estimated 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined; the Civic Type R is rated 25 mpg combined, and the Golf R is rated 24 mpg combined with a manual transmission and 25 mpg combined with an automatic. All of these cars require premium gas.\n\nDown-Market Interior\n\nThough 2018 brought updated cabin materials, they’re still not up to snuff for a car with a price tag that pushes $40,000. It felt on par with the interior of the Focus RS I tested in 2017, but it was definitely behind the Civic Type R and Golf R in terms of materials and design. The backseat is especially sparse, with no power ports or vents for those passengers.\n\nThe optional Recaro seats are a nice touch: They provide good bolstering and though I sometimes don’t fit well into sport seats (due to my personal wideness), I had no such issue with these. They come as part of a $2,500 option package that includes push-button start and keyless access. The standard 7-inch touchscreen that controls the multimedia system has touch-sensitive controls on either side of the screen, but the panel has small indentations that makes the individual buttons easier to locate. Unfortunately, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not included at this time (though they are included on other 2018 Subaru models).\n\nThe Recaro seats are standard if you jump up to the Limited trim level, which does spruce up the cabin a bit with leather upholstery, a navigation system, upgraded speakers and a power moonroof. But the Limited represents a $4,800 jump over what’s already a pretty expensive car. Which brings me to my next point …\n\nIt Costs How Much?\n\nThis new Subaru WRX starts at $36,955 (all prices include destination charges), but my test vehicle stickered at $39,455 (thanks to the aforementioned seats), which made my eyes pop. The Limited model at $41,755 isn’t much easier to stomach.\n\nThat’s a lot of scratch for a car that doesn’t have an upmarket interior and is lacking in safety features. Limited models do add blind sport warning, but you won’t find forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist or adaptive cruise control here. There are various reasons for this — for example, the STI’s hydraulic steering system means no lane keep assist (the feature requires electric power steering). But Subaru does offer its EyeSight safety system on other vehicles with a manual transmission (including the 2018 Subaru WRX), so its absence here is troubling.\n\nConclusion\n\nMake no mistake about it, the 2018 WRX STI is a well-sorted performance car with some very cool technology both underneath and inside of it that makes it a fun, spirited drive. But I can’t come up with a compelling reason to buy one over its competitors.\n\nIf you want to have the most fun, grab a Civic Type R with its brash styling and exceptional grip. If you require all-wheel drive and want the most performance, then the Focus RS is your cup of tea; it also has a weak interior but a more powerful engine and better gearbox than the Subaru. If you want something that has much more everyday livability, cargo room and safety technology while still being fun to drive, go with the Golf R.\n\nAnd although the Focus RS is priced similarly to the STI I tested, both the Civic Type R ($34,990) and the Golf R ($36,475) offer more for less. The Golf R even comes standard with forward automatic emergency braking, leather upholstery and navigation.\n\nI liked this WRX, but I like the other three a lot more.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For fans of performance cars, the last couple of years have been a breath of fresh air. Sure, we lost the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution to the scrap heap of history, but we gained the Ford Focus RS in 2016, and the Honda Civic Type R finally made its U.S. debut as a 2018 model. Those two, along with the Volkswagen Golf R, are a strong set of competitors (compare them here) that really give the WRX STI a run for its money.\n\nThe Focus RS is the most performance-driven, the Type R is incredibly fun and agile, and the Golf R combines interior quality with everyday livability and good performance credentials of its own. So where does that leave the 2018 STI?\n\nChanges for 2018\n\nThe 2018 WRX STI gets a slew of minor updates for the new model year that are geared to enhance performance and styling and address the STI’s interior quality issues. The driver-controlled center differential is now fully electronic, the suspension has been retuned and the Brembo brake system now features larger cross-drilled, vented discs front and rear, as well as six-piston front-calipers (versus the four-piston calipers from 2017) and a yellow finish on the calipers, as well.\n\nThere is a new front grille and 19-inch alloy wheels to enhance styling, as well as updated LED headlights that are steering-responsive (they pan left and right as you steer). The styling changes are hard to pick out; you’d have to line up the 2018 STI with last year’s side by side to really tell them apart. Inside, there are updated cabin materials and the option of a new pair of Recaro performance front seats. Compare the 2018 WRX STI with last year’s model.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe STI’s beating heart is a 305-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine that makes 295 lb-ft pounds-feet of torque. There is only one transmission, a six-speed manual. A symmetrical all-wheel-drive system is standard, and it features an electronic limited-slip center differential, helical gear-type limited-slip differential up front and a Torsen torque-sensing limited-slip differential in the rear.\n\nThere is also a good amount of driver customizability, with three different drive modes (Intelligent, Sport and Sport Sharp) and six manual differential lock control settings to change how power is distributed between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe three different drive modes change up throttle response quite drastically. At low engine speeds, the STI is quite docile — maximum horsepower isn’t until 6,000 rpm, and peak torque doesn’t come until 4,000 rpm. The Intelligent setting lets you sit in the lower rpm, which makes the car easier to manage in traffic or slower situations. But flip into the other two settings and the engine moves up in the rev range aggressively, building up power in a rush.\n\nWhile I liked the throttle response, it also highlighted my biggest problem with the WRX STI: its clutch and shifter. I’ve always had problems with Subaru clutches, which are heavy, feel inconsistent on the catch and are hard to drive smoothly. I can usually figure out a clutch within a few days with a car, but after a week with the STI, I was still a little flummoxed (as were my passengers). The shifter action feels similarly sloppy, especially compared with the short-throw tightness of the Focus RS and Civic Type R.\n\nHowever, if you push the STI, it remains a rewarding experience. The suspension tuning is a bit stiff for everyday use, but it pays off when you’re moving quicker. The front-to-rear balance is quite good, and if you’re driving aggressively, the lack of gearbox smoothness is less noticeable. The STI’s best trait is how it puts down power: The all-wheel drive works hard. I was also a fan of the STI’s power steering; instead of an electric system, it has a good old-fashioned hydraulic assist that offers tons of feedback. It’s a bit twitchy on center, which could be because those electric systems I’ve gotten accustomed to smooth out some of that feedback, but I’ll trade that for the system’s upsides.\n\nThe STI’s fuel-economy figures are not good at an EPA-estimated 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined; the Civic Type R is rated 25 mpg combined, and the Golf R is rated 24 mpg combined with a manual transmission and 25 mpg combined with an automatic. All of these cars require premium gas.\n\nDown-Market Interior\n\nThough 2018 brought updated cabin materials, they’re still not up to snuff for a car with a price tag that pushes $40,000. It felt on par with the interior of the Focus RS I tested in 2017, but it was definitely behind the Civic Type R and Golf R in terms of materials and design. The backseat is especially sparse, with no power ports or vents for those passengers.\n\nThe optional Recaro seats are a nice touch: They provide good bolstering and though I sometimes don’t fit well into sport seats (due to my personal wideness), I had no such issue with these. They come as part of a $2,500 option package that includes push-button start and keyless access. The standard 7-inch touchscreen that controls the multimedia system has touch-sensitive controls on either side of the screen, but the panel has small indentations that makes the individual buttons easier to locate. Unfortunately, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not included at this time (though they are included on other 2018 Subaru models).\n\nThe Recaro seats are standard if you jump up to the Limited trim level, which does spruce up the cabin a bit with leather upholstery, a navigation system, upgraded speakers and a power moonroof. But the Limited represents a $4,800 jump over what’s already a pretty expensive car. Which brings me to my next point …\n\nIt Costs How Much?\n\nThis new Subaru WRX starts at $36,955 (all prices include destination charges), but my test vehicle stickered at $39,455 (thanks to the aforementioned seats), which made my eyes pop. The Limited model at $41,755 isn’t much easier to stomach.\n\nThat’s a lot of scratch for a car that doesn’t have an upmarket interior and is lacking in safety features. Limited models do add blind sport warning, but you won’t find forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist or adaptive cruise control here. There are various reasons for this — for example, the STI’s hydraulic steering system means no lane keep assist (the feature requires electric power steering). But Subaru does offer its EyeSight safety system on other vehicles with a manual transmission (including the 2018 Subaru WRX), so its absence here is troubling.\n\nConclusion\n\nMake no mistake about it, the 2018 WRX STI is a well-sorted performance car with some very cool technology both underneath and inside of it that makes it a fun, spirited drive. But I can’t come up with a compelling reason to buy one over its competitors.\n\nIf you want to have the most fun, grab a Civic Type R with its brash styling and exceptional grip. If you require all-wheel drive and want the most performance, then the Focus RS is your cup of tea; it also has a weak interior but a more powerful engine and better gearbox than the Subaru. If you want something that has much more everyday livability, cargo room and safety technology while still being fun to drive, go with the Golf R.\n\nAnd although the Focus RS is priced similarly to the STI I tested, both the Civic Type R ($34,990) and the Golf R ($36,475) offer more for less. The Golf R even comes standard with forward automatic emergency braking, leather upholstery and navigation.\n\nI liked this WRX, but I like the other three a lot more.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For fans of performance cars, the last couple of years have been a breath of fresh air. Sure, we lost the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution to the scrap heap of history, but we gained the Ford Focus RS in 2016, and the Honda Civic Type R finally made its U.S. debut as a 2018 model. Those two, along with the Volkswagen Golf R, are a strong set of competitors (compare them here) that really give the WRX STI a run for its money.\n\nThe Focus RS is the most performance-driven, the Type R is incredibly fun and agile, and the Golf R combines interior quality with everyday livability and good performance credentials of its own. So where does that leave the 2018 STI?\n\nChanges for 2018\n\nThe 2018 WRX STI gets a slew of minor updates for the new model year that are geared to enhance performance and styling and address the STI’s interior quality issues. The driver-controlled center differential is now fully electronic, the suspension has been retuned and the Brembo brake system now features larger cross-drilled, vented discs front and rear, as well as six-piston front-calipers (versus the four-piston calipers from 2017) and a yellow finish on the calipers, as well.\n\nThere is a new front grille and 19-inch alloy wheels to enhance styling, as well as updated LED headlights that are steering-responsive (they pan left and right as you steer). The styling changes are hard to pick out; you’d have to line up the 2018 STI with last year’s side by side to really tell them apart. Inside, there are updated cabin materials and the option of a new pair of Recaro performance front seats. Compare the 2018 WRX STI with last year’s model.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe STI’s beating heart is a 305-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine that makes 295 lb-ft pounds-feet of torque. There is only one transmission, a six-speed manual. A symmetrical all-wheel-drive system is standard, and it features an electronic limited-slip center differential, helical gear-type limited-slip differential up front and a Torsen torque-sensing limited-slip differential in the rear.\n\nThere is also a good amount of driver customizability, with three different drive modes (Intelligent, Sport and Sport Sharp) and six manual differential lock control settings to change how power is distributed between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe three different drive modes change up throttle response quite drastically. At low engine speeds, the STI is quite docile — maximum horsepower isn’t until 6,000 rpm, and peak torque doesn’t come until 4,000 rpm. The Intelligent setting lets you sit in the lower rpm, which makes the car easier to manage in traffic or slower situations. But flip into the other two settings and the engine moves up in the rev range aggressively, building up power in a rush.\n\nWhile I liked the throttle response, it also highlighted my biggest problem with the WRX STI: its clutch and shifter. I’ve always had problems with Subaru clutches, which are heavy, feel inconsistent on the catch and are hard to drive smoothly. I can usually figure out a clutch within a few days with a car, but after a week with the STI, I was still a little flummoxed (as were my passengers). The shifter action feels similarly sloppy, especially compared with the short-throw tightness of the Focus RS and Civic Type R.\n\nHowever, if you push the STI, it remains a rewarding experience. The suspension tuning is a bit stiff for everyday use, but it pays off when you’re moving quicker. The front-to-rear balance is quite good, and if you’re driving aggressively, the lack of gearbox smoothness is less noticeable. The STI’s best trait is how it puts down power: The all-wheel drive works hard. I was also a fan of the STI’s power steering; instead of an electric system, it has a good old-fashioned hydraulic assist that offers tons of feedback. It’s a bit twitchy on center, which could be because those electric systems I’ve gotten accustomed to smooth out some of that feedback, but I’ll trade that for the system’s upsides.\n\nThe STI’s fuel-economy figures are not good at an EPA-estimated 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined; the Civic Type R is rated 25 mpg combined, and the Golf R is rated 24 mpg combined with a manual transmission and 25 mpg combined with an automatic. All of these cars require premium gas.\n\nDown-Market Interior\n\nThough 2018 brought updated cabin materials, they’re still not up to snuff for a car with a price tag that pushes $40,000. It felt on par with the interior of the Focus RS I tested in 2017, but it was definitely behind the Civic Type R and Golf R in terms of materials and design. The backseat is especially sparse, with no power ports or vents for those passengers.\n\nThe optional Recaro seats are a nice touch: They provide good bolstering and though I sometimes don’t fit well into sport seats (due to my personal wideness), I had no such issue with these. They come as part of a $2,500 option package that includes push-button start and keyless access. The standard 7-inch touchscreen that controls the multimedia system has touch-sensitive controls on either side of the screen, but the panel has small indentations that makes the individual buttons easier to locate. Unfortunately, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not included at this time (though they are included on other 2018 Subaru models).\n\nThe Recaro seats are standard if you jump up to the Limited trim level, which does spruce up the cabin a bit with leather upholstery, a navigation system, upgraded speakers and a power moonroof. But the Limited represents a $4,800 jump over what’s already a pretty expensive car. Which brings me to my next point …\n\nIt Costs How Much?\n\nThis new Subaru WRX starts at $36,955 (all prices include destination charges), but my test vehicle stickered at $39,455 (thanks to the aforementioned seats), which made my eyes pop. The Limited model at $41,755 isn’t much easier to stomach.\n\nThat’s a lot of scratch for a car that doesn’t have an upmarket interior and is lacking in safety features. Limited models do add blind sport warning, but you won’t find forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist or adaptive cruise control here. There are various reasons for this — for example, the STI’s hydraulic steering system means no lane keep assist (the feature requires electric power steering). But Subaru does offer its EyeSight safety system on other vehicles with a manual transmission (including the 2018 Subaru WRX), so its absence here is troubling.\n\nConclusion\n\nMake no mistake about it, the 2018 WRX STI is a well-sorted performance car with some very cool technology both underneath and inside of it that makes it a fun, spirited drive. But I can’t come up with a compelling reason to buy one over its competitors.\n\nIf you want to have the most fun, grab a Civic Type R with its brash styling and exceptional grip. If you require all-wheel drive and want the most performance, then the Focus RS is your cup of tea; it also has a weak interior but a more powerful engine and better gearbox than the Subaru. If you want something that has much more everyday livability, cargo room and safety technology while still being fun to drive, go with the Golf R.\n\nAnd although the Focus RS is priced similarly to the STI I tested, both the Civic Type R ($34,990) and the Golf R ($36,475) offer more for less. The Golf R even comes standard with forward automatic emergency braking, leather upholstery and navigation.\n\nI liked this WRX, but I like the other three a lot more.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
