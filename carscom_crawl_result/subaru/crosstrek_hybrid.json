      "expert_review": "The verdict: The compromises and expense of the Subaru Crosstrek’s hybrid system versus the excellent standard Crosstrek make it a smart choice for a very limited clientele.\n\nVersus the competition: Plug-in hybrids are increasingly common, and most of them come with some sort of compromise: higher cost to buy, limited cargo space, greater weight. But none of them offer standard all-wheel drive at this price like the Crosstrek Hybrid, giving it an advantage for those seeking all-weather capability and part-time electric efficiency.\n\nWe’re big fans of the Subaru Crosstrek here at Cars.com. The standard model was updated for 2018 and is incredibly spacious for its footprint. It drives like a bigger car, features all-weather capability, has just enough off-road ability to get you most places you’re likely to want to go and is amazingly inexpensive compared with the competition. No, it’s not quick (not even decently so), but it’s reasonably efficient even with its standard flat-four-cylinder engine. The Crosstrek has won our Subcompact SUV Challenge twice, with the most recent generation taking the crown  in 2018.\n\nFor 2019, Subaru has brought an electrified version back to the lineup, but the 2019 Crosstrek Hybrid is available only as a plug-in hybrid — meaning it has a bigger battery capable of limited electric-only travel after you plug in and charge it. It’s significantly more expensive than a standard Crosstrek, making us wonder if the boost in fuel economy (and performance) is worth the price.\n\nSame Popular Looks\n\nYou won’t pick a plug-in hybrid Crosstrek out of a crowd on first glance. It looks almost identical to the standard version, with a few minor tweaks. First, you’ll notice there are “fuel” doors on the rear quarter panels on both sides of the car. One is for gasoline, the other for the electric charging port. This is a terrible location for a charging port given most chargers are located at the front of a parking space, meaning you’ll have to stretch the charge cord down the driver’s side of the car to reach the port — if it can reach at all. (The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is guilty of the same offense.) My home 240-volt charger is near the front of my garage, meaning I had to do some creative parking in order to charge the Crosstrek Hybrid at home. Charging ports need to be at the front of a vehicle, not the rear.\n\nNote that unlike some larger plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars, the Crosstrek PHEV can make do without 240-volt charging. Subaru estimates an empty battery can be recharged in about five hours on a 120-volt household outlet using the provided cord. With 240 volts (which requires additional hardware), it can do it in about two hours.\n\nImproved Performance\n\nDriving the Crosstrek Hybrid is a serene experience — at least while electricity powers the car. EVs are usually wonderfully silent, and the Crosstrek is no exception: Smooth, calm acceleration is the name of the game, and as long as you don’t push too hard on the go-pedal, you’ll be rewarded with silent sailing. Alternatively, you can floor the accelerator and see just what the addition of electric motors does for the Crosstrek’s motivation. Spoiler alert: It makes it quicker. Subaru says the electric motors change the vehicle’s torque profile such that it subtracts a full second off its zero-to-60-mph sprint. That the car manages to do this despite being 600 pounds heavier than the standard Crosstrek is amazing.\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid works much like other plug-in hybrid vehicles: It prefers to keep itself in electric mode, using the gas engine as a booster when the juice runs out or when the driver calls for more performance than the electric motors alone can deliver. There is no EV-only mode, so you can’t push a button to lock the gas engine out like you can in some other PHEVs. There are, however, functions for holding the battery charge at a certain level or even recharging it as you drive by running the gas engine continually.\n\nThe driving experience is much like any other Crosstrek: comfortable and smooth, with quick handling and ride quality that makes it feel like a bigger, more sophisticated, more expensive automobile. Braking feel is excellent for a hybrid, meaning there’s no odd nonlinear electric feel to the brakes, simply a firm and progressive pedal. The hybrid is significantly heavier than the standard Crosstrek due to all that extra electric gear, and that manifests when changing directions. It doesn’t have the lightness the standard Crosstrek does, but it’s still easy to maneuver through traffic and around town.\n\nMore Efficient\n\nThe secret to the Crosstrek Hybrid is something Subaru calls its StarDrive system. It integrates two electric motor-generators — one that acts as an engine starter and generator, one that powers the vehicle in hybrid and EV driving modes and acts as a generator during deceleration (employing regenerative braking). Combined with the Crosstrek’s 2.0-liter flat-four-cylinder boxer engine and continuously variable transmission, the system cranks out 148 total horsepower. The car also features an 8.8 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that it uses to power the electric system. As in most Subarus, all-wheel drive is standard. The EPA estimates all of this tech enables the Crosstrek to go 17 miles on electric power alone before the engine needs to fire up, but our testing found this to be a bit conservative; we were able to eke out 21.4 miles of EV range before the engine kicked on. Once it does, the CVT keeps the engine revving more than it would with a conventional transmission, introducing a buzzy drone into your silent driving experience.\n\nBased on our drive, you can wring anywhere from 17-21 miles out of the Crosstrek in electric mode before the gas engine kicks in. Your range will vary, of course, especially if you use systems like air conditioning or heat, or if you have a heavy foot. Once electricity runs out, the Crosstrek gets an estimated 35 mpg combined (my test showed 36.9 mpg). This is a significant boost over the standard Crosstrek, which is rated 27/33/25 mpg city/highway/combined. Despite this boost to fuel economy, the hybrid’s overall range is almost identical to the standard Crosstrek: You get 480 miles in the former and 481 miles in the latter. This is due to the hybrid’s smaller gas tank, which is only about two-thirds the size of the tank in the standard version.\n\nIf you want more electric-only range, you’ll have to sacrifice your all-wheel drive to jump into a Hyundai Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid or a Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid. Both offer more electric (29 and 26 miles, respectively) and overall range, but neither can be had with all-wheel drive. If AWD is important, you can opt for a larger plug-in hybrid SUV in the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, which offers an estimated 22 miles of EV-only range (though we coaxed 27 miles out of one) and has the benefit of considerably more cargo room, but less sophisticated interior appointments and multimedia tech. Compare all four models.\n\nLess Useful\n\nThe hybrid is the highest-spec trim in the Crosstrek line, so you get standard leather seats, a high-grade instrument cluster and Starlink 8-inch multimedia display, a power driver’s seat and more. In the two front seats, the Crosstrek Hybrid is identical to a standard Crosstrek, albeit with some funkier blue trim colors. Otherwise it has the same great comfort, same excellent visibility, same spaciousness (that one doesn’t expect in a subcompact car footprint) as any other Crosstrek. The backseat is especially notable for its legroom, which you can’t get in most competitors. Passenger space isn’t negatively impacted by the larger battery in the hybrid; you can still carry five people in surprising comfort.\n\nThe problem with the interior comes when you look in the cargo area and realize that much of it is gone. A significant portion has been reassigned to the battery pack. The rear seatbacks do fold, but you’re still left with a higher cargo floor, which cuts down your ability to carry a lot of stuff; you’ll only manage a couple of small roll-aboard cases in the Hybrid. Cargo volume behind the backseat falls from 20.8 cubic feet in the standard car to 15.9 cubic feet in the Hybrid, and maximum cargo volume with the seats folded drops by 12.2 cubic feet to 43.1 total. If you’re willing to sacrifice that all-wheel-drive capability in favor of greater cargo room, look again to the Niro and Ioniq, which both offer more space. Alternatively, you can go with the Outlander, retain AWD capability and get almost twice the cargo space behind the backseat.\n\nSafety Is Standard\n\nThe 2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the standard version has, and it did quite well), nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (but again, the standard version has been tested). In addition to all-wheel drive, Subaru includes a number of standard safety systems as part of its EyeSight suite of electronic driver aids. It includes standard adaptive cruise control, precollision braking, lane departure warning and lane keep assist. Blind spot detection with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert are also standard. As in other Subarus featuring EyeSight, I found it to be intrusive and too much of a nanny when monitoring lane keeping, but I didn’t mind its collision alert functions. Adaptive cruise control worked well, too, but featured an annoying beep whenever it detected a vehicle in front of you or whenever that vehicle moved out of the way and allowed you to resume a set speed, meaning it was constantly beeping at me on the highway.\n\nThe Pricey Position\n\nBeing at the top of the Crosstrek lineup comes with a premium price. The new 2019 Crosstrek Hybrid starts at $35,970, including destination fee. That’s a sobering $13,100 more than a base Crosstrek 2.0i, though it does feature that significantly long list of standard equipment. In fact, there are very few options on the hybrid; my test car added a power moonroof, heated steering wheel, navigation system and Harman Kardon premium eight-speaker audio system, bringing its as-tested price to $38,470. A better comparison might be with a fully loaded non-hybrid Crosstrek 2.0i Limited, which tops out at $30,520 — meaning the Hybrid system adds nearly $8,000 to the window sticker — stressing the Crosstrek’s traditionally stellar value equation.\n\nCompetitors don’t cost quite as much. The Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid — itself a higher-riding crossover-style vehicle like the Crosstrek — starts at $29,495 but doesn’t have the same level of equipment; load one up with all the options and you’re at a more comparable $37,290. Same with the Hyundai Ioniq PHEV, which starts at a much lower $26,270, but when fully kitted out rings in at $33,245. Neither of these models feature the Crosstrek Hybrid’s standard AWD, however. The Mitsubi­­­­­shi Outlander PHEV does, but it’s a significantly bigger vehicle that starts at $36,890 and can range up to more than $43,000. Compare all four models.\n\nSo like any plug-in hybrid, whether or not the premium you’ll pay for the electrified powertrain is worth the money you’ll save in gasoline over your time with the car depends on how you use it. The Crosstrek Hybrid is indeed more fuel-efficient in all conditions than a standard Crosstrek, but stick within 20 miles of home (as most commuters do) and charge up nightly, and the savings can add up in both convenience and dollars. Whether the higher payments and less useful cargo space will work for you depends on your own personal use characteristics, but the car itself is just as good to drive as a standard Crosstrek.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated June 28, 2019, clarifying that the Crosstrek Hybrid is not the only plug-in hybrid to offer standard all-wheel drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek straddles the line between high-riding wagon and small SUV. The Crosstrek’s proportions make it more agile than many larger SUVs, and its outdoorsy appeal is boosted by standard all-wheel drive and a cabin with a no-nonsense layout and excellent outward visibility. A lethargic 152-horsepower four-cylinder serves as the base powertrain, but an available 182-hp four-cylinder adds more sizzle. Subaru also offers a plug-in-hybrid version of the Crosstrek with an estimated electric-only driving range of 17 miles, but it’s priced considerably higher than the rest of the range. Direct competitors include the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Hyundai Kona, Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-30.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nAn all-new Crosstrek is expected for the 2024 model year, so changes are few. A Crosstrek Special Edition joins the lineup, coming exclusively in Desert Khaki paint with dark-gray exterior trim and fitted with 17-inch dark-gray alloy wheels. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n6.5-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nOne USB port\nBluetooth\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic climate control\nFour-speaker stereo\nSix-speed manual transmission\nRearview camera\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nPush-button start\nHarman Kardon audio system\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nMoonroof\n8-inch touchscreen\nLeather seating\nNavigation\nEight-speaker stereo\nBlind spot warning system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru Crosstrek?\n\nThe Crosstrek stands out thanks to a combination of go-anywhere capability and everyday driving comfort. While it’s not as large as some rival SUVs, the Crosstrek’s smaller proportions make it easier to dart through traffic and navigate narrow woodland trails. The interior won’t win any design awards, but the major controls are logically placed and there’s ample occupant space. Forward progress is modest with the base engine, so it’s worth considering the peppier 182-hp four-cylinder if highway passing power is important to you.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: New Sport trim level; new, more-powerful engine for higher trims (including Sport); available lane-centering steering; styling tweaks; different suspension tuning\n\nPrice change: $140 to $640 on gas-only Crosstrek for carryover trim levels; $240 on Crosstrek Hybrid\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? On the whole, the improvements to the 2021 are probably worth the increase in price, assuming you can’t find any substantial discounts on a leftover 2020 Crosstrek. And if you want the added power of the 2.5-liter engine, you’ll have to get a 2021 Sport or Limited trim. But shoppers would do well to compare the Crosstrek to its increasing number of competitors, as it recently relinquished its title of Best Affordable Small SUV in our judgment.\n\nRelated: 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Review: Bigger Is (Mostly) Better\n\nWhat’s New\n\nSubaru’s popular Crosstrek and Crosstrek Hybrid small SUVs got some updates for the 2021 model year, with the gas-only Crosstrek getting the most significant one: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine for the range-topping Limited and new mid-level Sport trim, the same used in the larger Outback and Forester SUVs and the Legacy sedan. Meanwhile, the Crosstrek Hybrid is actually a plug-in hybrid with an EPA-rated 17 miles of all-electric range on a full charge.\n\nThe added oomph from the 2.5-liter addresses a concern about the lack of power from the Crosstrek’s base 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but it’s still held back by the relaxed and sometimes noisy behavior from its continuously variable automatic transmission. Base and Premium models come standard with a six-speed manual transmission, but the CVT is standard on the Sport and Limited.\n\nOther changes to the Crosstrek for 2021 include revised styling — most notably a redone front bumper — as well as tweaked suspension tuning and newly available lane-centering steering.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nStrong suits for the Crosstrek that carry over include a comfortable ride that benefits from the Crosstrek’s relatively larger platform versus similarly priced micro-SUVs, plus a robust set of available safety and driver-assist features Subaru calls EyeSight.\n\nBesides its lack of quickness, we’ve also found the Crosstrek to slip behind the competition when it comes to available technologies. That won’t make a difference for consumers stacking up the 2021 and 2020 models, but it might behoove interested shoppers focused on technology to investigate Subaru’s competitors in this space.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2021 Crosstrek and Crosstrek Hybrid are on sale now. Prices for the base Crosstrek and Crosstrek Premium rise a total of $140 for 2021, with $40 of that coming from the destination fee’s increase to $1,050 from $1,010. The most-expensive trim, called the Limited, gets the new 2.5-liter along with a $640 higher price, while the new Sport trim slots in below it. The Crosstrek Hybrid, meanwhile, increases $240; note its price below excludes federal tax credits, which can return up to $4,502 on the purchase of any 2019-21 Crosstrek Hybrid. \n\nFull pricing is below, and all prices include the destination fee.\n\nBase trim with a six-speed manual transmission: $23,295\nBase, continuously variable automatic: $24,645\nPremium, six-speed manual: $24,345\nPremium, CVT: $25,695\nSport, CVT: $27,545\nLimited: CVT: $29,045\nHybrid: $36,395\n\n \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The compromises and expense of the Subaru Crosstrek’s hybrid system versus the excellent standard Crosstrek make it a smart choice for a very limited clientele.\n\nVersus the competition: Plug-in hybrids are increasingly common, and most of them come with some sort of compromise: higher cost to buy, limited cargo space, greater weight. But none of them offer standard all-wheel drive at this price like the Crosstrek Hybrid, giving it an advantage for those seeking all-weather capability and part-time electric efficiency.\n\nWe’re big fans of the Subaru Crosstrek here at Cars.com. The standard model was updated for 2018 and is incredibly spacious for its footprint. It drives like a bigger car, features all-weather capability, has just enough off-road ability to get you most places you’re likely to want to go and is amazingly inexpensive compared with the competition. No, it’s not quick (not even decently so), but it’s reasonably efficient even with its standard flat-four-cylinder engine. The Crosstrek has won our Subcompact SUV Challenge twice, with the most recent generation taking the crown  in 2018.\n\nFor 2019, Subaru has brought an electrified version back to the lineup, but the 2019 Crosstrek Hybrid is available only as a plug-in hybrid — meaning it has a bigger battery capable of limited electric-only travel after you plug in and charge it. It’s significantly more expensive than a standard Crosstrek, making us wonder if the boost in fuel economy (and performance) is worth the price.\n\nSame Popular Looks\n\nYou won’t pick a plug-in hybrid Crosstrek out of a crowd on first glance. It looks almost identical to the standard version, with a few minor tweaks. First, you’ll notice there are “fuel” doors on the rear quarter panels on both sides of the car. One is for gasoline, the other for the electric charging port. This is a terrible location for a charging port given most chargers are located at the front of a parking space, meaning you’ll have to stretch the charge cord down the driver’s side of the car to reach the port — if it can reach at all. (The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is guilty of the same offense.) My home 240-volt charger is near the front of my garage, meaning I had to do some creative parking in order to charge the Crosstrek Hybrid at home. Charging ports need to be at the front of a vehicle, not the rear.\n\nNote that unlike some larger plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars, the Crosstrek PHEV can make do without 240-volt charging. Subaru estimates an empty battery can be recharged in about five hours on a 120-volt household outlet using the provided cord. With 240 volts (which requires additional hardware), it can do it in about two hours.\n\nImproved Performance\n\nDriving the Crosstrek Hybrid is a serene experience — at least while electricity powers the car. EVs are usually wonderfully silent, and the Crosstrek is no exception: Smooth, calm acceleration is the name of the game, and as long as you don’t push too hard on the go-pedal, you’ll be rewarded with silent sailing. Alternatively, you can floor the accelerator and see just what the addition of electric motors does for the Crosstrek’s motivation. Spoiler alert: It makes it quicker. Subaru says the electric motors change the vehicle’s torque profile such that it subtracts a full second off its zero-to-60-mph sprint. That the car manages to do this despite being 600 pounds heavier than the standard Crosstrek is amazing.\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid works much like other plug-in hybrid vehicles: It prefers to keep itself in electric mode, using the gas engine as a booster when the juice runs out or when the driver calls for more performance than the electric motors alone can deliver. There is no EV-only mode, so you can’t push a button to lock the gas engine out like you can in some other PHEVs. There are, however, functions for holding the battery charge at a certain level or even recharging it as you drive by running the gas engine continually.\n\nThe driving experience is much like any other Crosstrek: comfortable and smooth, with quick handling and ride quality that makes it feel like a bigger, more sophisticated, more expensive automobile. Braking feel is excellent for a hybrid, meaning there’s no odd nonlinear electric feel to the brakes, simply a firm and progressive pedal. The hybrid is significantly heavier than the standard Crosstrek due to all that extra electric gear, and that manifests when changing directions. It doesn’t have the lightness the standard Crosstrek does, but it’s still easy to maneuver through traffic and around town.\n\nMore Efficient\n\nThe secret to the Crosstrek Hybrid is something Subaru calls its StarDrive system. It integrates two electric motor-generators — one that acts as an engine starter and generator, one that powers the vehicle in hybrid and EV driving modes and acts as a generator during deceleration (employing regenerative braking). Combined with the Crosstrek’s 2.0-liter flat-four-cylinder boxer engine and continuously variable transmission, the system cranks out 148 total horsepower. The car also features an 8.8 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that it uses to power the electric system. As in most Subarus, all-wheel drive is standard. The EPA estimates all of this tech enables the Crosstrek to go 17 miles on electric power alone before the engine needs to fire up, but our testing found this to be a bit conservative; we were able to eke out 21.4 miles of EV range before the engine kicked on. Once it does, the CVT keeps the engine revving more than it would with a conventional transmission, introducing a buzzy drone into your silent driving experience.\n\nBased on our drive, you can wring anywhere from 17-21 miles out of the Crosstrek in electric mode before the gas engine kicks in. Your range will vary, of course, especially if you use systems like air conditioning or heat, or if you have a heavy foot. Once electricity runs out, the Crosstrek gets an estimated 35 mpg combined (my test showed 36.9 mpg). This is a significant boost over the standard Crosstrek, which is rated 27/33/25 mpg city/highway/combined. Despite this boost to fuel economy, the hybrid’s overall range is almost identical to the standard Crosstrek: You get 480 miles in the former and 481 miles in the latter. This is due to the hybrid’s smaller gas tank, which is only about two-thirds the size of the tank in the standard version.\n\nIf you want more electric-only range, you’ll have to sacrifice your all-wheel drive to jump into a Hyundai Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid or a Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid. Both offer more electric (29 and 26 miles, respectively) and overall range, but neither can be had with all-wheel drive. If AWD is important, you can opt for a larger plug-in hybrid SUV in the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, which offers an estimated 22 miles of EV-only range (though we coaxed 27 miles out of one) and has the benefit of considerably more cargo room, but less sophisticated interior appointments and multimedia tech. Compare all four models.\n\nLess Useful\n\nThe hybrid is the highest-spec trim in the Crosstrek line, so you get standard leather seats, a high-grade instrument cluster and Starlink 8-inch multimedia display, a power driver’s seat and more. In the two front seats, the Crosstrek Hybrid is identical to a standard Crosstrek, albeit with some funkier blue trim colors. Otherwise it has the same great comfort, same excellent visibility, same spaciousness (that one doesn’t expect in a subcompact car footprint) as any other Crosstrek. The backseat is especially notable for its legroom, which you can’t get in most competitors. Passenger space isn’t negatively impacted by the larger battery in the hybrid; you can still carry five people in surprising comfort.\n\nThe problem with the interior comes when you look in the cargo area and realize that much of it is gone. A significant portion has been reassigned to the battery pack. The rear seatbacks do fold, but you’re still left with a higher cargo floor, which cuts down your ability to carry a lot of stuff; you’ll only manage a couple of small roll-aboard cases in the Hybrid. Cargo volume behind the backseat falls from 20.8 cubic feet in the standard car to 15.9 cubic feet in the Hybrid, and maximum cargo volume with the seats folded drops by 12.2 cubic feet to 43.1 total. If you’re willing to sacrifice that all-wheel-drive capability in favor of greater cargo room, look again to the Niro and Ioniq, which both offer more space. Alternatively, you can go with the Outlander, retain AWD capability and get almost twice the cargo space behind the backseat.\n\nSafety Is Standard\n\nThe 2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the standard version has, and it did quite well), nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (but again, the standard version has been tested). In addition to all-wheel drive, Subaru includes a number of standard safety systems as part of its EyeSight suite of electronic driver aids. It includes standard adaptive cruise control, precollision braking, lane departure warning and lane keep assist. Blind spot detection with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert are also standard. As in other Subarus featuring EyeSight, I found it to be intrusive and too much of a nanny when monitoring lane keeping, but I didn’t mind its collision alert functions. Adaptive cruise control worked well, too, but featured an annoying beep whenever it detected a vehicle in front of you or whenever that vehicle moved out of the way and allowed you to resume a set speed, meaning it was constantly beeping at me on the highway.\n\nThe Pricey Position\n\nBeing at the top of the Crosstrek lineup comes with a premium price. The new 2019 Crosstrek Hybrid starts at $35,970, including destination fee. That’s a sobering $13,100 more than a base Crosstrek 2.0i, though it does feature that significantly long list of standard equipment. In fact, there are very few options on the hybrid; my test car added a power moonroof, heated steering wheel, navigation system and Harman Kardon premium eight-speaker audio system, bringing its as-tested price to $38,470. A better comparison might be with a fully loaded non-hybrid Crosstrek 2.0i Limited, which tops out at $30,520 — meaning the Hybrid system adds nearly $8,000 to the window sticker — stressing the Crosstrek’s traditionally stellar value equation.\n\nCompetitors don’t cost quite as much. The Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid — itself a higher-riding crossover-style vehicle like the Crosstrek — starts at $29,495 but doesn’t have the same level of equipment; load one up with all the options and you’re at a more comparable $37,290. Same with the Hyundai Ioniq PHEV, which starts at a much lower $26,270, but when fully kitted out rings in at $33,245. Neither of these models feature the Crosstrek Hybrid’s standard AWD, however. The Mitsubi­­­­­shi Outlander PHEV does, but it’s a significantly bigger vehicle that starts at $36,890 and can range up to more than $43,000. Compare all four models.\n\nSo like any plug-in hybrid, whether or not the premium you’ll pay for the electrified powertrain is worth the money you’ll save in gasoline over your time with the car depends on how you use it. The Crosstrek Hybrid is indeed more fuel-efficient in all conditions than a standard Crosstrek, but stick within 20 miles of home (as most commuters do) and charge up nightly, and the savings can add up in both convenience and dollars. Whether the higher payments and less useful cargo space will work for you depends on your own personal use characteristics, but the car itself is just as good to drive as a standard Crosstrek.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated June 28, 2019, clarifying that the Crosstrek Hybrid is not the only plug-in hybrid to offer standard all-wheel drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Prices increase slightly on all trims without any additional content.\n\nPricing: The 2022 Crosstrek starts at $23,620. Prices increase from $325-$425, depending on the trim level. Part of that comes from the destination fee, which increases to $1,175, up $125 for 2022.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022? Opt for a 2021 model if you can find one to take advantage of the slightly lower price.\n\nSubaru’s smallest SUV was refreshed for 2021 with an updated face, a new engine and an additional trim level called Sport. For 2022, there are no changes to the Crosstrek except for a small price bump. The plug-in-hybrid model, called simply the Crosstrek Hybrid, also returns unchanged and sees a price increase.\n\nRelated: 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Review: Bigger Is (Mostly) Better\n\nLike last year, the 2022 Crosstrek is again available in Base, Premium, Sport and Limited trims. Subaru’s newly available 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, borrowed from the Legacy sedan and the Forester and Outback SUVs, comes on the Crosstrek’s Sport and Limited trim levels.\n\nThe other trims, Base and Premium, still have last year’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both of these  trims again use a standard six-speed automatic; a continuously variable automatic transmission is available on those models and standard on all other trims. All-wheel drive is again standard on all trims.\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid also carries over for 2022, and it’s good for an EPA-estimated 17 miles of all-electric range on a full charge. It has a combined rating of 35 mpg thereafter and up to 90 mpg-equivalent.\n\n2022 Crosstrek Pricing\n\nFull pricing is below, followed by the price change for 2022. All prices include the destination fee, which increased $125:\n\nBase trim with a six-speed manual transmission: $23,620 ($325 increase)\nBase, CVT: $24,970 ($325)\nPremium, six-speed manual: $24,770 ($425)\nPremium, CVT: $26,120 ($425)\nSport, CVT: $27,970 ($425)\nLimited: CVT: $29,470 ($425)\nHybrid: $36,820 ($425)\n\nThe Crosstrek Hybrid qualifies for up to $4,502 in federal tax credits, and certain states offer rebates beyond that.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nThe Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid is the most powerful and best-driving variant of the Crosstrek family.\nIt’s not the most fuel-efficient hybrid in its class, but it makes up for it in capability and excellent driving dynamics.\nA fuel-economy estimate of 36 mpg combined makes it easily the most efficient Crosstrek available.\n\nI’ll keep it short and simple:\n\nFor 2026, the Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid is the one to get in the Crosstrek lineup as long as it’s within budget and you don’t need the capability of the Wilderness trim. The hybrid drives the sweetest, is the most powerful configuration and is notably more efficient than the gas-only model.\n\nIt’s a bit of a no-duh moment — again, provided you can swallow the extra $3,370 for the Crosstrek Sport Hybrid and $2,000 for the Crosstrek Limited Hybrid when compared with the gas-only trim counterparts. Though much like the current Subaru Forester Hybrid — from which the Crosstrek Hybrid’s new green guts are directly copied and pasted — the efficiency gains are not quite on par with other subcompact hybrid SUVs.\n\nWhat Is the Fuel Economy of the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid?\nTakeaway: The 2026 Crosstrek Hybrid is rated at 36/36/36 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nCompare Subaru’s fuel-economy estimates of 36/36/36 mpg for the Crosstrek Hybrid with the non-hybrid 2025 Crosstrek’s 27/33/29 mpg (official EPA estimates are not yet available for the 2026 model). So, a clear step up from the all-gas version, but now compare it to the all-wheel-drive 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid’s manufacturer-estimated 42 mpg combined rating and the front-wheel-drive 2025 Kia Niro Hybrid’s 53/54/53 mpg rating.\n\n2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nNot as strong as the competition, but the Niro’s lack of AWD makes it an apples-to-oranges comparison, and the Crosstrek Hybrid’s retention of Subaru’s signature mechanical AWD is generally more effective than the electric-motor-based e-AWD setup in the Corolla Cross. It’s also what’s likely sapping some efficiency from the Subaru’s hybrid drivetrain.\n\nA very rudimentary cost analysis of the Crosstrek Sport versus the Crosstrek Sport Hybrid reveals an annual fuel savings of around $400, requiring 8.5 years of ownership to break even based on the Sport Hybrid’s upfront price premium. It’s a calculation based on broad averages — $4.40 per gallon fuel, 13,500 miles a year — but it’s worth considering if max efficiency and savings is your goal.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid Drive?\nTakeaway: As the most powerful drivetrain in the lineup, the new Crosstrek Hybrid is the nicest for both daily driving and road trips thanks to both power and efficiency.\n\nPersonally, I think the fuel savings are simply an added bonus to the Crosstrek Hybrid’s sweet, sweet driving character. Its 194 combined horsepower is up 14 hp over the 180 hp in the gas-only ‘Trek, and even though it’s not significantly quicker than its non-hybrid counterpart, it turns the Crosstrek’s “Totally Fine” acceleration into “Totally Fine+” on an on-ramp or when passing.\n\nThe key here is smoothness. At lower speeds and extended moments of coasting, the eco-‘Trek is significantly quieter and more refined than the non-hybrid. It’s a satisfying powertrain, with excellent handoff between gas and electric propulsion and with enough power for any realistic scenario that’s made better by the Crosstrek’s impressive driving character. As this is very much an Impreza hatch on stilts, the Crosstrek — in all configurations — remains one of the sharpest-driving subcompact SUVs you can buy. Slicing through the squiggled back roads of rural Washington state wasn’t so much fun as it was satisfying, with little body roll and excellent composure.\n\nGood stuff, all around. It’s not the most efficient in the segment, but the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid is a welcome addition to one of the most compelling and capable subcompact SUV model lines on the market.\n\nMore Subaru News From Cars.com:\n\nHow Much Is the 2026 Subaru Crosstrek?\nAll-New 2026 Subaru Outback Searches for a New Middle Ground\n2026 Subaru Trailseeker Up Close: Your Electric Outback is Here\n2026 Subaru Solterra Review: Necessary Improvements\n2026 Subaru WRX, BRZ Sting With Special Series.Yellow Editions\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
