      "expert_review": "Subaru Baja fills yet another niche that no one knew existed: a compact four-door pickup that drives like a car.\n\nHere’s the modern equivalent of the iconoclastic Subaru Brat from 1977, back in the days when the Japanese automaker was struggling for identity. The Brat was quirky and unique and cute as a koala.\n\nToday, Subaru has made major inroads with its all-wheel-drive line of small and midsize sedans, wagons and the truck-like Forester. They all drive well with a reputation for bulletproof reliability.\n\nAnd the Baja is, well, a lot more practical than the Brat. It has four doors and a usable front and back seat, plus a pickup bed that extends to a bit more than 5 feet with a “Switchback” passage into the cab that extends another 30 inches or so.\n\nBut the Baja falls flat on appearance.\n\nA genuinely nice-driving car, it’s saddled with one of the dorkiest looks ever, a yellow and silver nerdmobile set off by a pair of ridiculous driving lights on the roof rack that, from the rear, look like Mickey Mouse ears.\n\nWhere Brat was cute, Baja is goofy. It’s long and loopy, neither car nor truck, with absurd silver plastic lower body cladding, the kind of stuff jettisoned by most other automakers as hopelessly tacky.\n\nIt’s too bad, too, because other than its styling, the Baja is such a nice vehicle. Similar in execution to the bigger Ford Sport Trac and much bigger Chevrolet Avalanche, Baja takes the basis of a sport utility and adds a small pickup bed for those times when you just have to have a truck. With its tubular bed extender that goes out on the pickup bed (a familiar feature in today’s small pickups) the Baja was able to carry three mountain bikes. And it looked pretty sporty doing so.\n\nThe removable panel in the back of the cabin allows long objects to jut through, similar to the Avalanche but not nearly as versatile.\n\nThe pickup bed has much appeal, but don’t expect to carry too much cargo. With the extender and passageway closed, the bed is just 3 1/2 feet long, too small for much more than a week’s worth of groceries. Smartly, it’s lined with plastic to prevent damage from such things as a (small) load of rocks.\n\nOne of the oddest features is the pair of large driving lights on the roof, such as a hard-core Jeep driver might install for nighttime forays into the backcountry.\n\nProblem is, the Baja is not a tough four-wheel drive but a car-like all-wheel drive, great on snow and dirt roads, not so great on boulder-strewn Jeep trails. In other words, the lights are kind of pretentious.\n\nEven more oddly, the lights can be lit only by pulling up on the parking brake. What sense does that make?\n\nIncongruously, the interior of the test Baja was fairly conservative in muted grays and blacks, with none of the fun-time excesses of the exterior. Driving the Baja, it’s easy to picture oneself in a conservative sedan rather than an extroverted runabout. The inconsistency is weird and disconcerting.\n\nPowered by Subaru’s usual “flat” four, delivering a smooth 165 horsepower, the Baja feels lively and quick, although it would be nice if Subaru offered its strong, 3-liter six as an option. The tester came with automatic; a five-speed is standard.\n\nThe Baja comes just one way: fully loaded, including sunroof, leather seating, 16-inch alloy wheels, stereo with CD, power driver’s seat, cruise control, keyless entry and bed liner, at its base price of $23,995 for stickshift, $24,795 for automatic. Shipping tacks on $525.\n\nBaja is a versatile little critter at a moderate price. Too bad it looks so strange.\n\nSubaru Baja\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, four-door pickup, all-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $24,795.\n\nPrice as tested: $25,320.\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter flat six, 165 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 166 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 104.3 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 21 city, 26 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\n-Compact versatility.\n\n-Overall driveability.\n\n-All features standard.\n\nLows:\n\n-Awkward styling.\n\n-Subdued interior.\n\n-Those roof-mounted lights.",

A turbocharged engine goes into the Baja Turbo, which was added for the 2004 model year.\n\nFor 2005, a new net-type center storage pocket for the rear seatback was installed, and the 12-volt power outlet was relocated to the console storage box. All models were pre-wired for optional high-powered, offroad Baja lights. A hard bed cover accompanied the upgraded Baja Turbo with the Leather Package.\n\nThe only changes for the 2006 model year are a newly standard security system and keyless entry.\n\nAssertive styling touches give the Baja Turbo a distinctive appearance, and its turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder produces 210 horsepower. The regular all-wheel-drive four-passenger Baja Sport carries a 165-hp four-cylinder.\n\nExterior\nExcept for its small cargo bed at the rear, the Baja bears some resemblance to other Subaru models, including the Forester SUV. The Baja features enlarged front fenders and large, foldable, body-colored mirrors. Integrated fog lights sit behind protective stone guards. The Baja’s grille is unique, while its stylized alloy fuel door is similar to the one used on Subaru’s ST/X concept.\n\nA power moonroof is standard. The Baja rides a 104.3-inch wheelbase and has 8.4 inches of ground clearance.\n\nA Switchback system provides a reconfigurable rear seat and cargo area. With the optional bed extender, cargo bed length increases to 60.5 inches and can hold such equipment as mountain bikes and surfboards. Tie-down hooks, a bed light and sport bars on the cargo bed are installed. Roof rails and crossbars are standard.\n\nInterior\nBajas can seat four occupants. The driver faces gauges ringed in silver trim. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, remote keyless entry, an outside-temperature gauge, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The Baja Turbo Leather Package includes a six-way power driver’s seat and heated front seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSubaru’s 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder generates 165 hp in the Baja Sport, while the Turbo model features a 210-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder that produces 235 pounds-feet of torque. A five-speed-manual transmission with Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional. Turbo models can be equipped with an automatic transmission featuring a manual-shift provision.\n\nSafety\nThe Baja has depowered front airbags with a dual-stage front-passenger airbag. The front seat belts have pretensioners and load limiters.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe quiet, smooth-running Baja drives easily and has a pleasant feel. Confident steering produces a near-sporty feel. The ride is firm but not unpleasant, even on rough pavement. After initial hesitation, acceleration is fairly good from a standstill, but low-speed passing power is mild.\n\nThe front seats have unusually snug side bolstering. The backseat is fairly comfortable, but legroom could be better.",

      "expert_review": "No matter how nostalgic one gets for the good ol’ days, I’ll bet most new car shoppers wouldn’t want a new vehicle to be trimmed with a vinyl roof and opera lamps.\n\nSo, what bit of weird automotive nostalgia would make Subaru create a new model that seems to be little more than a new version of the Subaru Brat.\n\nAh yes, the Brat. It helped synthesize Subaru’s reputation for weird transportation.\n\nAfter all, what other pickup “trucklet” featured a rear-facing seat in the cargo bed? It was the ultimate mother-in-law seat.\n\nThe new Baja lacks that feature, but it does have its share of eccentricity.\n\nBased on the Legacy/Outback wagons, the Baja is stretched 6 inches, and trades its rear cargo area for a petite 3.5-foot cargo bed. That may be enough room to haul a few bags of fertilizer home or maybe a couple plants. Heck, it might be big enough for your pony-sized dog. But don’t look to haul anything particularly big.\n\nCouple the short bed with the Baja’s four doors, and this Subaru has a particularly dorky look.\n\nTough looking? I don’t think so. Sporty? Hardly.\n\nThankfully, the drivetrain is superior to the styling. Which engine you get depends on trim level. There are three: Baja, Baja Sport and Baja Turbo.\n\nThe Baja and Baja Sport feature the Outback’s tried and true horizontally-opposed 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Good for a respectable 165 horsepower, its power is merely adequate for the Baja’s 3,600-plus-pound curb weight.\n\nBetter to opt for the new 2004 Baja Turbo. This model uses the same horizontally opposed turbocharged 2-liter four-cylinder engine found in the Subaru WRX STi. That means a ground-pounding 210 horsepower. All Bajas come with a five-speed manual transmission standard. A four-speed automatic is optional. Like all Subarus, the Baja employs all-wheel-drive.\n\nSubaru provided a Baja Turbo for testing.\n\nThe Baja Turbo moves quicker than the class nerd running from a bully after school. With the horsepower and all-wheel-drive, this vehicle has good power and tenacious grip in all driving situations. The rack-and-pinion steering inspires confidence. This invites you to flog it like you’re driving your Baja across Baja.\n\nBut cornering is distinctly average, with lots of body lean coming on quickly. The four-wheel independent suspension does a good job in the ride department, endowing the vehicle with a firm, yet absorbent ride without all the bouncing typical of pickups.\n\nThe feel of the accelerator also inhibits things – a light feel that’s typical of Japanese vehicle manufacturers.\n\nSo this is no sports truck.\n\nThe interior is standard issue Outback, with easy to operate controls, legible gauges and a mediocre AM/FM/CD audio system.\n\nSeat comfort is similar to the Outback – the seats are only slightly softer than a park bench.\n\nUnlike the five-passenger Outback, the Baja accommodates four. This is because the center portion of the rear seats are use as a console and cupholder.\n\nBut Subaru also has designed some real utility into the rear seat, which folds down. Behind the seats you’ll find what Subaru calls a “Switchback.” This 30-inch wide opening allows for long, thin cargo to slip from the cargo bed into the passenger compartment. With such a small bed, it will be needed.\n\nThe Baja Turbo uses premium fuel, and returned a respectable 21 mpg in mixed driving. This is above average for any all-wheel-drive vehicle.\n\nWhile the performance of the Baja Turbo is pretty good, its utility seems questionable. Obviously, buyers agree.\n\nWhen the Baja was introduced in September 2002, Subaru was forecasting annual production of 24,000 units. But strong pricing and a recall to fix automatic transmissions hurt initial sales.\n\nSubaru currently offers a $2,000 incentive and has reduced annual production to a mere 10 0 units.\n\nWhile none of this will dissuade the Subaru faithful from buying this Brat-like offspring, it might give pause to those who need real pickup utility and the wealth of offerings available from other manufacturers.",
