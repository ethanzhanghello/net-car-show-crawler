      "expert_review": "The 2018 Subaru WRX isn’t an immediately likable compact sports sedan. It took me a few days of thrashing on a World Rally Blue Pearl WRX Premium to scale the car’s learning curve, but once I started meshing with it, it was clear there are few cars in the $30,000 price range that combine no-drama acceleration and slot-car handling like the WRX.\n\nFor 2018, the Subaru WRX is mildly updated, with revised tuning to the suspension, power steering, manual transmission shifter and clutch. There’s also a new Performance Package with upgraded brake rotors and more aggressive front seats. These changes take the WRX further away from its roots as the 2012 Subaru Impreza, which was a practical but awful car to drive (I know because I own one of those 2012s). It’s worth noting that the 2018 is mostly the same WRX that debuted in 2015, not the next-generation WRX we hope to see soon based off the great-driving, redesigned 2017 Subaru Impreza. Compare the 2018 WRX with the 2017 WRX here.\n\nFast and Loud\n\nThe WRX’s 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine may not seem like a powerhouse given that a 2018 Ford Mustang with turbocharged four-cylinder makes 310 hp, but the Subaru plants all its flat-four power without drama thanks to standard all-wheel drive. Prominent turbocharger lag is a downer, with noticeable delay between romping the accelerator and feeling the surge of acceleration. Mitigating the turbocharger lag to quickly accelerate from a stop takes a lot of engine revs and a balance of clutch and accelerator to keep revs high. When you do nail the launch, though, the WRX rockets like it has more power under the hood than the spec sheet says. It’s not that the Subaru WRX’s turbo lag has gotten worse, it’s that cars like the Volkswagen Golf GTI have gotten better, with quick turbocharger response and sharper acceleration. Back to our Mustang comparison, the `Stang’s turbo four is really good and responsive — and for 2018, it has a lot more torque.\n\nOnce the WRX levels out at cruising speed, there’s loud humming from the road that sounds like massive, knobby off-road tires whirring away at all four corners. Wind noise isn’t as much of an issue in the Subaru WRX as road noise, which is loud enough to make conversations difficult. The thud of tire impacts suggests the car has hit something big when it’s just road tar. I can’t say the Dunlop Sport Maxx RT summer tires are the culprit because I haven’t driven a WRX without them, but I had similar tire noise issues from a set of Dunlop summer tires on a 2017 Nissan GT-R (SP Sport Maxx GT 600).\n\nThe noise is forgotten at a first flick of the steering wheel onto a highway ramp, where the WRX sticks like the tires are covered in glue. It takes a lot of effort to unsettle the Subaru WRX despite it not having the fancier all-wheel-drive system of the WRX STI. The WRX’s electronic torque-vectoring brakes the front-inside wheel in corners and helps reduce understeer to the great effect of lightening the nose of the car. For 2018, Subaru retuned the front and rear shock absorbers and springs, as well as the rear stabilizer bar (19 mm versus the outgoing 20 mm), to improve steering stability and ride comfort. It doesn’t transform the ride quality, and while it’s hard to say for sure without back-to-back loops in the old one and new one, steering effort is lighter than I remember but not bad. The handling still isn’t as razor-sharp as in the Subaru BRZ coupe.\n\nManual Transmission Quirks\n\nMost new Subaru WRXs are sold with the six-speed manual transmission — which is how it should be, because the only other option is a slushy continuously variable automatic. My first takeaway on the new clutch tuning is that the clutch pedal engagement is too close to the floor and goes from disengaged to engaged within a half inch off the floor. Because there’s still the rest of the stiff pedal travel to go, I got a left-foot workout driving the WRX in city traffic.\n\nThe prompt clutch engagement is helpful, however, in clicking off quick shifts given the pedal doesn’t have to move far to engage the newly selected gear. The transmission responds better to fast, higher-rpm shifting, but it takes trial and error to figure out how to drive the car quickly and smoothly. That’s made difficult by the shifter itself, which has good engagement but long throws. In the end, I ended up liking the clutch engagement but only when shifting quickly. Driving this car slowly is a chore and a half.\n\nImproved-ish Interior\n\nFor 2018, rubberized door handles replace the hard plastic ones, and a larger multifunction display is surrounded by imitation leather upholstery with red contrast stitching. They’re nice touches, but they don’t make the interior more competitive; the sophisticated VW Golf GTI remains the class leader in this regard. The WRX’s mediocre interior remains one of the off-putting aspects carried over from the 2012 Impreza that should be addressed in the next-generation WRX.\n\nThe Subaru WRX has a leg up, however, on competitors like the Golf GTI and Ford Focus ST thanks to its cavernous interior and great outward visibility due to thin pillars and a seating position that’s high off the floor. I actually wanted the optional Recaro seats in the Performance Package to sit lower to the ground, reflecting I was in a sports sedan rather than a regular sedan, but otherwise I was comfortable in the highly bolstered performance chairs — and they look good, too.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Subaru WRX received top ratings in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness and crash-avoidance tests. An optional EyeSight system includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and for 2018 it adds auto vehicle hold, which holds the brakes at stoplights or on hills. There’s also a new LED system to show EyeSight alerts on the windshield. Unfortunately, EyeSight is available only on the most expensive trim level, the Limited, so our mid-level Premium package test car didn’t include it.\n\nWorth the Money?\n\nThe Subaru WRX is available in base, Premium and Limited trim levels; compare pricing and equipment here. My Premium test car came with the optional Performance Package and had an as-tested price of around $32,000. For all its performance enhancements, the little quirks here and there in the driving experience mean the WRX isn’t a flawless performance package. I couldn’t help but think that if I bought one, I’d immediately have to dump money into a new shifter, quieter tires and some engine mods to get the WRX in a spot I’d be happy with.\n\nPerhaps the fact that I drove a 2017 Subaru BRZ right afterward — a tight, perfectly balanced coupe with one of the best shifters in the game — tainted my perspective on the WRX. The Subaru WRX feels more like a juiced-up Impreza than a dedicated performance model. Yes, of course, it is a juiced-up Impreza — but cars like the Golf GTI and Focus ST feel more wholly transformed, and the BRZ is in a different league altogether. If the BRZ had 50-75 more horsepower, this would be a very different review — starting with, “If you don’t need four doors, buy a BRZ instead.” Still, it’s hard to refuse the WRX’s all-wheel-drive launches and flat, grippy handling in this price range, even if it means living with a few quirks along the way.",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Subaru WRX remains one of the quickest all-wheel-drive vehicles you can buy for less than $30,000, but automatic-transmission shoppers will have to settle for a disappointing new CVT.\n\nRedesigned for 2015, the Subaru WRX catches up to the fourth-gen Impreza on which it’s (finally) based. The current Impreza went on sale in October 2011; its turbocharged sibling remained based on the prior generation for three model years, so a redesign has been a long time coming. The WRX comes in base, Premium and Limited trims, and all-wheel drive is standard. We tested a Limited with the optional continuously variable transmission, an automatic that’s new for 2015. The WRX also offers a six-speed manual. We cover the higher-performance WRX STi separately in the Research section.\n\nWhile the Impreza comes as a sedan or hatchback, both turbocharged siblings are sedan-only. Click here to compare the Impreza, WRX and STi, or here to stack up the prior-generation WRX with this 2015 redesign.\n\nExterior & Styling\nInside and out, the Impreza’s econobox styling factored into its sixth-place overall finish among seven compact sedans we tested in 2013 (click here to read more). Subaru went to great lengths to differentiate the Subaru WRX, which is a visual smorgasbord of performance and clutter. The car gets a slew of unique body panels, including the hood, front fenders, doors and bumpers, and the results bear only a passing resemblance to the Impreza. The functional hood scoop integrates nicely into the hood. The headlight accents carve a mean expression, and the deep bumper extensions integrate well with their surroundings. But the oversized bumper portals have a cluttered mix of lighting elements and obviously faux carbon fiber. Around back, a hodgepodge of tailpipes — four! — and off-color diffusers look just plain silly.\n\nStandard 17-inch alloy wheels wear factory-installed Dunlop SP Sport Maxx RT tires. Limited models have LED low-beam headlights.\n\nHow It Drives\nPerformance enthusiasts might set their Subaru effigies ablaze for the automaker’s decision to pair the WRX with a CVT. In the 268-horsepower Subaru WRX, it’s all about hitting a sweet spot around 3,000 to 6,000 rpm. That’s when the Subie surges ahead, though it falls short of really hauling ass. The transmission employs driver-selectable modes, and our editors agreed the efficiency-minded Intelligent mode treats the car’s power like ABC Family would treat an airing of “Blackhawk Down.” Engine revs climb late, and it takes a good prod on the gas before you reach higher rpm. The rubber-band sensation familiar to anyone who’s driven a CVT — wait, here it comes — is alive and well in the WRX. SI-Drive’s Sport mode hurries up the rev climb, but it still exhibits a soupy nonlinearity that’s anathema to driving fun.\n\nSubaru says both modes adhere to six fixed gear ratios like a stepped automatic if you push the accelerator past a given point (40 percent down in Intelligent, 30 percent in Sport). That leads to more conventional-feeling acceleration and highway kickdowns, but it takes a consistent lead foot to bring it about. Around town, get used to the rubber band.\n\nSI-Drive’s raciest mode, Sport Sharp, is really the only way to drive the WRX. It holds eight fixed gear ratios all the time, upshifting and downshifting like a responsive eight-speed automatic — with kickdowns free of gear hunting, something that plagues many conventional automatics. It even blips engine revs on downshifts as you decelerate. Sure, it’s as contrived as the smiles in a family portrait, but I’ll take it — especially because the WRX doesn’t default back to the fun-siphoning Intelligent mode when you turn it off. The next time you drive, it’s right how you left it.  Still, one editor said Sport Sharp spoils some of the revving fun by sending you well past the engine’s power band to a point where things peter off, then upshifting to a point where the revs are still too high.\n\nSubaru’s all-wheel drive splits power 50/50 percent (front/rear) in cars with manual transmissions through a simple viscous coupling, and 45/55 percent through a more sophisticated electronic split in CVT-equipped cars — one benefit to getting the CVT. Both systems can divert full power to one axle or another. We threw our tester around in plenty of late-winter mud, and it handled split-traction surfaces with little excess wheelspin.\n\nOn the pavement, the WRX drifts with smile-inducing ease, though the winter tires on our test car ceded grip early. The automatic’s rear-biased power split delivers satisfying neutrality: Barrel through a sweeping turn, and the tail swings out nearly in tandem with the nose. It’s a controllable, natural process that rarely sneaks up on you — though some enthusiasts may find too much body roll accompanies it all, despite Subaru thickening the WRX’s front stabilizer bar compared with that of its predecessor.\n\nThe WRX rides firmer than it used to and firmer than the regular Impreza. Subaru says this version has stiffer springs, shocks and bushings than the last WRX, and our car did indeed bounce harshly through ruts and potholes; that minimizes daily-driver potential if you live around rough pavement. Still, cabin isolation at higher speeds shines; the WRX removes the turbulence from undulating pavement that many, and possibly most, compact cars allow through. That’s not to say it’s quiet: A headache-inducing exhaust howl intrudes on music or conversation, particularly as the tachometer needle descends below 1,500 rpm on your way to a stop. Even those accustomed to blatting exhausts will grow annoyed by this one.\n\nWant to know more about the power story? Gearheads, read on. The new WRX adopts the FA-series turbo four-cylinder from the Forester XT. It’s still a horizontally opposed flat-4 engine, but like in the Forester, displacement falls to 2.0 liters from the 2.5 liters the WRX has displaced since 2006. Still, the turbo 2.0-liter gains direct fuel injection and variable valve timing (cam phasing only, no variable lift) on the intake and exhaust camshafts, versus the phased VVT on the intake valves only for the last, port-injected WRX. It also adopts unique camshafts and higher-rate valve springs versus the Forester XT, which enables a 6,700 rpm redline in stick-shift WRXs — up 700 rpm versus the Forester XT’s FA20 engine. Add it all up, and the WRX makes 268 hp. The increased compression ratio (10.6:1 versus 8.4:1 in the last WRX) helps to drive torque to 258 pounds-feet from 2,000 to 5,200 rpm. That roughly matches the last WRX’s horsepower (265 hp) and beats its torque (244 pounds-feet at 4,000 rpm) by a meaningful amount — not bad, given that Subaru says the new car weighs just 60 pounds more.\n\nInterior\nOur impressions of the Impreza’s interior (click here to read them) largely carry over to the WRX, which has excellent A-pillar visibility and — except for a discount headliner — high-quality materials. Changes versus the Impreza include a flat-bottom steering wheel and larger seat bolsters, particularly at the shoulders. Editors agreed they exhibit good lateral support without sacrificing comfort. Except for a large center floor hump that’s endemic of most cars with all-wheel drive, backseat room is decent.\n\nFabric upholstery with red stitching is standard. So are single-zone automatic climate control and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with HD radio, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and steering-wheel controls. Premium models add heated seats, a moonroof, fog lights and illuminated visor mirrors. Atop all that, the Subaru WRX Limited adds leather and a power driver’s seat. Options include a 6.1-inch navigation system, keyless access with push-button start and a Harman Kardon stereo. Consider the stereo upgrade; editors agreed the base system is a tinny mess.\n\nDual-zone climate control, something various competitors offer, isn’t available until you step up to the WRX STi. All cars have a standard 4.3-inch LCD screen with various displays, including a nifty boost gauge that also shows accelerator position in percent. Still, the screen is distant and can get washed out in sunlight — a problem for the standard backup camera, which displays on it.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe trunk measures 12 cubic feet. That’s up from the last WRX’s 11.3 cubic feet, but it’s still tight for a compact sedan — a Volkswagen Jetta GLI, for example, has 15.5 cubic feet. Note that trunks in the WRX’s hatchback competitors aren’t directly comparable because of how they’re measured (click here to learn more). A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard.\n\nSafety\nThe WRX scored top marks in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, making it a Top Safety Pick. Seven airbags, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes are standard. Lane-departure, blind-spot and forward-collision warning systems — features increasingly available in other compacts — are unavailable, which prevents Top Safety Pick Plus status. The features are an odd omission on the WRX, given Subaru’s EyeSight system (available on the Forester, Outback and Legacy) packages most of them and ranks among the best active-safety systems on the market.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features, or here to see our Car Seat Check evaluation of child-safety-seat provisions in the Impreza sedan.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2015 WRX starts around $27,000 with the destination charge, which is just $300 more than the 2014 WRX. Pile on the options, however, and the car gets pricey. Subaru WRX Premium models add $2,200, while the Subaru WRX Limited tacks on another $1,500. The automatic runs another $1,200, and it’s hard to justify — particularly because it’s not, as CVTs often are, the efficient choice. EPA gas mileage, which Subaru says is measured in SI-Drive’s Sport mode, is a modest fuel economy estimate of 19/25/21 mpg city/highway/combined, versus 21/28/24 mpg with the manual; Subaru recommends premium gas for best performance.\n\nStill, if you steer clear of the automatic and many other options, the WRX remains a performance bargain. Outgoing editions of the MazdaSpeed3 and Volkswagen GTI ran about $25,000 and $26,000, respectively, in their final years — and both are slower, front-drive cars. The redesigned WRX is a compelling body-type choice, but stick with the stick.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Subaru WRX isn’t an immediately likable compact sports sedan. It took me a few days of thrashing on a World Rally Blue Pearl WRX Premium to scale the car’s learning curve, but once I started meshing with it, it was clear there are few cars in the $30,000 price range that combine no-drama acceleration and slot-car handling like the WRX.\n\nFor 2018, the Subaru WRX is mildly updated, with revised tuning to the suspension, power steering, manual transmission shifter and clutch. There’s also a new Performance Package with upgraded brake rotors and more aggressive front seats. These changes take the WRX further away from its roots as the 2012 Subaru Impreza, which was a practical but awful car to drive (I know because I own one of those 2012s). It’s worth noting that the 2018 is mostly the same WRX that debuted in 2015, not the next-generation WRX we hope to see soon based off the great-driving, redesigned 2017 Subaru Impreza. Compare the 2018 WRX with the 2017 WRX here.\n\nFast and Loud\n\nThe WRX’s 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine may not seem like a powerhouse given that a 2018 Ford Mustang with turbocharged four-cylinder makes 310 hp, but the Subaru plants all its flat-four power without drama thanks to standard all-wheel drive. Prominent turbocharger lag is a downer, with noticeable delay between romping the accelerator and feeling the surge of acceleration. Mitigating the turbocharger lag to quickly accelerate from a stop takes a lot of engine revs and a balance of clutch and accelerator to keep revs high. When you do nail the launch, though, the WRX rockets like it has more power under the hood than the spec sheet says. It’s not that the Subaru WRX’s turbo lag has gotten worse, it’s that cars like the Volkswagen Golf GTI have gotten better, with quick turbocharger response and sharper acceleration. Back to our Mustang comparison, the `Stang’s turbo four is really good and responsive — and for 2018, it has a lot more torque.\n\nOnce the WRX levels out at cruising speed, there’s loud humming from the road that sounds like massive, knobby off-road tires whirring away at all four corners. Wind noise isn’t as much of an issue in the Subaru WRX as road noise, which is loud enough to make conversations difficult. The thud of tire impacts suggests the car has hit something big when it’s just road tar. I can’t say the Dunlop Sport Maxx RT summer tires are the culprit because I haven’t driven a WRX without them, but I had similar tire noise issues from a set of Dunlop summer tires on a 2017 Nissan GT-R (SP Sport Maxx GT 600).\n\nThe noise is forgotten at a first flick of the steering wheel onto a highway ramp, where the WRX sticks like the tires are covered in glue. It takes a lot of effort to unsettle the Subaru WRX despite it not having the fancier all-wheel-drive system of the WRX STI. The WRX’s electronic torque-vectoring brakes the front-inside wheel in corners and helps reduce understeer to the great effect of lightening the nose of the car. For 2018, Subaru retuned the front and rear shock absorbers and springs, as well as the rear stabilizer bar (19 mm versus the outgoing 20 mm), to improve steering stability and ride comfort. It doesn’t transform the ride quality, and while it’s hard to say for sure without back-to-back loops in the old one and new one, steering effort is lighter than I remember but not bad. The handling still isn’t as razor-sharp as in the Subaru BRZ coupe.\n\nManual Transmission Quirks\n\nMost new Subaru WRXs are sold with the six-speed manual transmission — which is how it should be, because the only other option is a slushy continuously variable automatic. My first takeaway on the new clutch tuning is that the clutch pedal engagement is too close to the floor and goes from disengaged to engaged within a half inch off the floor. Because there’s still the rest of the stiff pedal travel to go, I got a left-foot workout driving the WRX in city traffic.\n\nThe prompt clutch engagement is helpful, however, in clicking off quick shifts given the pedal doesn’t have to move far to engage the newly selected gear. The transmission responds better to fast, higher-rpm shifting, but it takes trial and error to figure out how to drive the car quickly and smoothly. That’s made difficult by the shifter itself, which has good engagement but long throws. In the end, I ended up liking the clutch engagement but only when shifting quickly. Driving this car slowly is a chore and a half.\n\nImproved-ish Interior\n\nFor 2018, rubberized door handles replace the hard plastic ones, and a larger multifunction display is surrounded by imitation leather upholstery with red contrast stitching. They’re nice touches, but they don’t make the interior more competitive; the sophisticated VW Golf GTI remains the class leader in this regard. The WRX’s mediocre interior remains one of the off-putting aspects carried over from the 2012 Impreza that should be addressed in the next-generation WRX.\n\nThe Subaru WRX has a leg up, however, on competitors like the Golf GTI and Ford Focus ST thanks to its cavernous interior and great outward visibility due to thin pillars and a seating position that’s high off the floor. I actually wanted the optional Recaro seats in the Performance Package to sit lower to the ground, reflecting I was in a sports sedan rather than a regular sedan, but otherwise I was comfortable in the highly bolstered performance chairs — and they look good, too.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Subaru WRX received top ratings in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness and crash-avoidance tests. An optional EyeSight system includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and for 2018 it adds auto vehicle hold, which holds the brakes at stoplights or on hills. There’s also a new LED system to show EyeSight alerts on the windshield. Unfortunately, EyeSight is available only on the most expensive trim level, the Limited, so our mid-level Premium package test car didn’t include it.\n\nWorth the Money?\n\nThe Subaru WRX is available in base, Premium and Limited trim levels; compare pricing and equipment here. My Premium test car came with the optional Performance Package and had an as-tested price of around $32,000. For all its performance enhancements, the little quirks here and there in the driving experience mean the WRX isn’t a flawless performance package. I couldn’t help but think that if I bought one, I’d immediately have to dump money into a new shifter, quieter tires and some engine mods to get the WRX in a spot I’d be happy with.\n\nPerhaps the fact that I drove a 2017 Subaru BRZ right afterward — a tight, perfectly balanced coupe with one of the best shifters in the game — tainted my perspective on the WRX. The Subaru WRX feels more like a juiced-up Impreza than a dedicated performance model. Yes, of course, it is a juiced-up Impreza — but cars like the Golf GTI and Focus ST feel more wholly transformed, and the BRZ is in a different league altogether. If the BRZ had 50-75 more horsepower, this would be a very different review — starting with, “If you don’t need four doors, buy a BRZ instead.” Still, it’s hard to refuse the WRX’s all-wheel-drive launches and flat, grippy handling in this price range, even if it means living with a few quirks along the way.",

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Subaru WRX isn’t an immediately likable compact sports sedan. It took me a few days of thrashing on a World Rally Blue Pearl WRX Premium to scale the car’s learning curve, but once I started meshing with it, it was clear there are few cars in the $30,000 price range that combine no-drama acceleration and slot-car handling like the WRX.\n\nFor 2018, the Subaru WRX is mildly updated, with revised tuning to the suspension, power steering, manual transmission shifter and clutch. There’s also a new Performance Package with upgraded brake rotors and more aggressive front seats. These changes take the WRX further away from its roots as the 2012 Subaru Impreza, which was a practical but awful car to drive (I know because I own one of those 2012s). It’s worth noting that the 2018 is mostly the same WRX that debuted in 2015, not the next-generation WRX we hope to see soon based off the great-driving, redesigned 2017 Subaru Impreza. Compare the 2018 WRX with the 2017 WRX here.\n\nFast and Loud\n\nThe WRX’s 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine may not seem like a powerhouse given that a 2018 Ford Mustang with turbocharged four-cylinder makes 310 hp, but the Subaru plants all its flat-four power without drama thanks to standard all-wheel drive. Prominent turbocharger lag is a downer, with noticeable delay between romping the accelerator and feeling the surge of acceleration. Mitigating the turbocharger lag to quickly accelerate from a stop takes a lot of engine revs and a balance of clutch and accelerator to keep revs high. When you do nail the launch, though, the WRX rockets like it has more power under the hood than the spec sheet says. It’s not that the Subaru WRX’s turbo lag has gotten worse, it’s that cars like the Volkswagen Golf GTI have gotten better, with quick turbocharger response and sharper acceleration. Back to our Mustang comparison, the `Stang’s turbo four is really good and responsive — and for 2018, it has a lot more torque.\n\nOnce the WRX levels out at cruising speed, there’s loud humming from the road that sounds like massive, knobby off-road tires whirring away at all four corners. Wind noise isn’t as much of an issue in the Subaru WRX as road noise, which is loud enough to make conversations difficult. The thud of tire impacts suggests the car has hit something big when it’s just road tar. I can’t say the Dunlop Sport Maxx RT summer tires are the culprit because I haven’t driven a WRX without them, but I had similar tire noise issues from a set of Dunlop summer tires on a 2017 Nissan GT-R (SP Sport Maxx GT 600).\n\nThe noise is forgotten at a first flick of the steering wheel onto a highway ramp, where the WRX sticks like the tires are covered in glue. It takes a lot of effort to unsettle the Subaru WRX despite it not having the fancier all-wheel-drive system of the WRX STI. The WRX’s electronic torque-vectoring brakes the front-inside wheel in corners and helps reduce understeer to the great effect of lightening the nose of the car. For 2018, Subaru retuned the front and rear shock absorbers and springs, as well as the rear stabilizer bar (19 mm versus the outgoing 20 mm), to improve steering stability and ride comfort. It doesn’t transform the ride quality, and while it’s hard to say for sure without back-to-back loops in the old one and new one, steering effort is lighter than I remember but not bad. The handling still isn’t as razor-sharp as in the Subaru BRZ coupe.\n\nManual Transmission Quirks\n\nMost new Subaru WRXs are sold with the six-speed manual transmission — which is how it should be, because the only other option is a slushy continuously variable automatic. My first takeaway on the new clutch tuning is that the clutch pedal engagement is too close to the floor and goes from disengaged to engaged within a half inch off the floor. Because there’s still the rest of the stiff pedal travel to go, I got a left-foot workout driving the WRX in city traffic.\n\nThe prompt clutch engagement is helpful, however, in clicking off quick shifts given the pedal doesn’t have to move far to engage the newly selected gear. The transmission responds better to fast, higher-rpm shifting, but it takes trial and error to figure out how to drive the car quickly and smoothly. That’s made difficult by the shifter itself, which has good engagement but long throws. In the end, I ended up liking the clutch engagement but only when shifting quickly. Driving this car slowly is a chore and a half.\n\nImproved-ish Interior\n\nFor 2018, rubberized door handles replace the hard plastic ones, and a larger multifunction display is surrounded by imitation leather upholstery with red contrast stitching. They’re nice touches, but they don’t make the interior more competitive; the sophisticated VW Golf GTI remains the class leader in this regard. The WRX’s mediocre interior remains one of the off-putting aspects carried over from the 2012 Impreza that should be addressed in the next-generation WRX.\n\nThe Subaru WRX has a leg up, however, on competitors like the Golf GTI and Ford Focus ST thanks to its cavernous interior and great outward visibility due to thin pillars and a seating position that’s high off the floor. I actually wanted the optional Recaro seats in the Performance Package to sit lower to the ground, reflecting I was in a sports sedan rather than a regular sedan, but otherwise I was comfortable in the highly bolstered performance chairs — and they look good, too.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Subaru WRX received top ratings in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness and crash-avoidance tests. An optional EyeSight system includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and for 2018 it adds auto vehicle hold, which holds the brakes at stoplights or on hills. There’s also a new LED system to show EyeSight alerts on the windshield. Unfortunately, EyeSight is available only on the most expensive trim level, the Limited, so our mid-level Premium package test car didn’t include it.\n\nWorth the Money?\n\nThe Subaru WRX is available in base, Premium and Limited trim levels; compare pricing and equipment here. My Premium test car came with the optional Performance Package and had an as-tested price of around $32,000. For all its performance enhancements, the little quirks here and there in the driving experience mean the WRX isn’t a flawless performance package. I couldn’t help but think that if I bought one, I’d immediately have to dump money into a new shifter, quieter tires and some engine mods to get the WRX in a spot I’d be happy with.\n\nPerhaps the fact that I drove a 2017 Subaru BRZ right afterward — a tight, perfectly balanced coupe with one of the best shifters in the game — tainted my perspective on the WRX. The Subaru WRX feels more like a juiced-up Impreza than a dedicated performance model. Yes, of course, it is a juiced-up Impreza — but cars like the Golf GTI and Focus ST feel more wholly transformed, and the BRZ is in a different league altogether. If the BRZ had 50-75 more horsepower, this would be a very different review — starting with, “If you don’t need four doors, buy a BRZ instead.” Still, it’s hard to refuse the WRX’s all-wheel-drive launches and flat, grippy handling in this price range, even if it means living with a few quirks along the way.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Starting around $30,000, the manual 2022 Subaru WRX is an inherently fun and unique all-wheel-drive performance car.\n\nVersus the competition: Where the WRX lacks some sharpness compared with the competition, it makes up for it with standard all-wheel drive for all-season duty.\n\nThe previous-generation Subaru WRX was great: a four-door sedan with plentiful grip and an eager driving feel. But it was also an absolute brute of a car, with raw, unpolished driving characteristics that didn’t offer much in the way of everyday comfort. For 2022, the WRX receives a complete overhaul, now riding on Subaru’s Global Platform, which is claimed to improve dynamics and reduce noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). Given NVH is the three-letter acronym most synonymous with Subaru’s sport compact sedan (after WRX, that is), I was eager to drive the latest version to see if it offers a more polished experience.\n\nRelated: 2022 Subaru WRX: Unfrozen Caveman Sports Car\n\nNew Engine You Gotta Feel\n\nA new 271-horsepower, turbocharged 2.4-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 268-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Looking at their peak numbers, you wouldn’t expect a significantly different driving experience between the engines, but that’s not the experience behind the wheel. The previous engine suffered from acceleration and turbo lag, requiring a good winding out to access its power. Now, thanks in part to more displacement and an electronically controlled wastegate, Subaru says the engine is more responsive and has a broader torque curve. The result is more linear power delivery that doesn’t take as much work to access — or leave you waiting for something to happen at lower engine speeds.\n\n2022 Subaru WRX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nPerhaps thanks to that torque accessibility, as well as some other changes, the 2022 WRX with a six-speed manual transmission is significantly easier to drive than the 2021 version. Simply having a manual transmission isn’t good enough these days, but the new WRX’s manual is a good one. The old WRX was difficult to launch quickly; its clutch takeup was right off the floor, and engagement happened within an inch of clutch-pedal travel. Getting off the line quickly required high engine speeds of 4,000-plus rpm; too much throttle and the clutch would burn, but not enough throttle and the car would bog.\n\nSubaru slightly tweaked the six-speed manual’s gear ratios and improved its shift qualities, and the new WRX’s clutch action is considerably more forgiving, making the car easy to drive and accelerate quickly from a stop. Like the old car, the manual is easy to shift quickly, and the brake and accelerator pedals are in good positions to execute heel-and-toe shifting — a good thing given there’s no auto rev-match feature for smoothing downshifts, as some competitors offer.\n\n2022 Subaru WRX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nFull-on acceleration tested the traction limits of my test car’s all-season tires (Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4s), which spun at the front before the rears joined the party. (The WRX comes standard with summer performance tires, but Subaru fitted all-seasons to this particular car because we drove it during a cold season in Chicago.) I also observed traction control or engine management pulling power after aggressive shifting — even with traction control disabled — with acceleration waning after a shift before the engine wanted to get moving again.\n\nThe WRX’s engine and exhaust don’t make many distinctive noises audible from the driver’s seat, though there are pops and spits when shifting at the engine’s top end. This is a common downside of modern turbocharged performance cars, where the turbocharger in the exhaust stream acts like a muffler and good NVH characteristics mean engine and exhaust noises are less likely to enter the cabin. Many automakers attempt to enhance the audible experience via electronic augmentation using the car’s interior speakers, but few do it successfully. Others, such as Hyundai N cars, have variable exhaust systems that provide multiple volume options. The WRX is a staple of aftermarket customization, though, so perhaps Subaru is letting owners figure it out for themselves; the 2022 WRX will likely be no stranger to aftermarket exhaust systems.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe redesigned WRX’s ride and handling is perhaps the most interesting change from the previous generation. With a new platform, Subaru says it’s increased chassis stiffness across the vehicle, providing more responsive steering and handling as well as a quieter ride. I can confirm that the WRX’s ride quality has improved, though that was with the previously mentioned Michelin all-season tires. All-season tires often have more pliability than summer tires, which tends to improve ride quality, so we don’t know yet how the new WRX rides with its standard tires.\n\nRide quality as equipped was excellent, with the standard fixed-firmness shock absorbers versus the WRX GT trim’s exclusive adaptive-firmness shock absorbers; the suspension prevents impacts from disturbing the cabin. The suspension is still firm, but there aren’t big hits that upset the car, and it’s quite nice to drive. There’s also more sophistication in how the car manages broken pavement and bumpy roads, while also being quieter than before — again, perhaps a product of the all-season tires. I recall a loud whirring at highway speeds in a previous-generation WRX with summer tires.\n\nAs you’d expect from less aggressive tires, handling at the limit seemed to take a hit. There was an unsettledness in fast sweeping onramps, and the car doesn’t drive with the immediate confidence of the new Civic Si on its all-season tires. At corner turn-in, the Civic Si tells you exactly what’s happening through steering-wheel feedback; there’s vagueness in the WRX’s steering, which uses a new dual-pinion power-steering system. The steering is quicker, though, with a 13.5:1 ratio versus the outgoing 14.3:1 ratio, resulting in fewer turns lock-to-lock: 2.5 versus 2.8 or 2.7 (depending on trim level).\n\nInterior and New 11.6-Inch Touchscreen\n\nOn the inside, the WRX’s styling is unique versus the Subaru Impreza sedan on which it’s based, with a different appearance but very similar materials quality. There’s less rear-seat headroom versus an Impreza, however: 36.7 inches versus 37.2 inches in the Impreza.\n\n2022 Subaru WRX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe biggest difference inside the WRX is a new 11.6-inch touchscreen. It does some good things, like allowing Apple CarPlay to use a large part of the screen — rare in portrait-style systems — but it also does some strange things. You’d think the seat-heater button on the touchscreen would turn on the heated seats, but it doesn’t; it only accesses the heated seat menu from which you turn on the heated seats. Also, Android Auto smartphone connectivity doesn’t get the big screen view like CarPlay does, so Android users are stuck with a smaller interface. Subaru addressed these issues on its more recent 11.6-inch system, called Starlink Media Plus, which debuts on the updated 2023 Outback.\n\nWhat About That Cladding?\n\nWhether the WRX’s plastic cladding adds to or subtracts from the car’s appearance is up to you, but I suggest seeing it in person before making your decision; it appeared cheap to me in pictures, but it’s less offensive in person. The WRX has aggressive styling overall that’s pleasing to my eye, with broader fenders that look mighty aggressive in the flesh. What I think the cladding does well is give the wheel openings extra height, so they look better in proportion to the body. I always thought the ratio of the old WRX looked dinky, with wheel openings that seemed too small in relation to the body. The new cladding solves that by visually enlarging the wheel openings.\n\n2022 Subaru WRX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nIs the 2022 WRX Worth It?\n\nThe WRX remains the only sport compact with AWD, which is a big advantage among its peers for all-season driving in wintry climates. The WRX also has a good mix of power and handling — the Civic Si very much has only handling nailed down — and the new Subaru is also a much better daily driver than it was before.\n\nAs equipped, however, the new WRX felt a little soft compared with the previous generation. Considering the previous car’s jarring ride, I didn’t find this completely offensive, but Subaru might have gone a little too far in making the WRX more daily-drivable, especially considering there’s no longer a WRX STI (it’s been discontinued) for those who want higher performance capabilities.\n\nMy final judgment is yet to come because I’d like to see how this car drives with its summer tires. I suspect it won’t change the overall demeanor, but a little extra grip and steering crispness would likely help it feel less tepid.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2022 Subaru WRX Prices Start at $30,100\nUp Close With the 2022 Subaru WRX: Different Enough?\nThe 2020 Subaru WRX STI Series White Is All Sold Out, and That’s OK\nHyundai Launches Latest N-Badged Models Onto the Track\n2022 Hyundai Elantra N: Your Move, Honda\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Subaru WRX?\n\nThe Subaru WRX is a compact performance sedan with seating for five people. It shares basic design elements with Subaru’s mainstream Impreza compact car, but it has a gutsier engine, a performance-oriented all-wheel-drive system and distinctive sporty styling touches inside and out, including unusual SUV-esque matte-black body cladding. A 271-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine can be paired with a six-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission; however, available driver-assist safety features (including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, evasive steering assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking) can be had only with the CVT. The WRX comes in base, Premium, Limited and GT trim levels; the GT comes solely with the CVT and includes Recaro sport front seats, a premium sound system, an adaptive suspension and additional drive modes. The WRX lineup spans a fairly broad price range, so rivals include the Hyundai Elantra N, Toyota GR Corolla, Volkswagen Golf GTI and, at the high end, the Honda Civic Type R and Volkswagen Golf R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Subaru WRX? \n\nRedesigned for 2022, the WRX sees no significant changes for 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Subaru WRX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n17-inch alloy wheels \nSix-speed manual transmission  \nAuto-dimming rearview mirror\n60/40-split, folding rear seat\nLeather-wrapped tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nDual 7-inch infotainment touchscreens \nLED headlights\nDual front USB ports\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nContinuously variable automatic transmission\nAdaptive headlights\nKeyless entry and ignition\n11.6-inch infotainment touchscreen\nNavigation system\n11-speaker Harman-Kardon sound system\nDual rear USB ports\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front seats\n10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat\nShould I Buy the 2023 Subaru WRX?\n\nThough the WRX lost some of its raucousness and edginess when it was redesigned for 2022, it became more refined all around and gained a larger engine with smoother power delivery. Even though the car has grown up a bit, its distinctive rally-bred attitude is still there. Despite some equipment availability frustrations — desirable safety features are available only with the automatic transmission, and you’ll have to step up to the pricey, automatic-only GT trim to get certain performance features — the WRX continues to appeal as an everyday performance car that can be driven in all seasons.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: As long as you’re OK trading up or resisting trim envy for a hypothetical future WRX STI, the new WRX tS is the current top-dog super-Subie with its adjustable suspension, digital display and all the WRX TR’s goodies.\n\nVersus the competition: Moderately outgunned in performance when compared to the Toyota GR Corolla and Honda Civic Type R, the WRX tS is still a strong performer that balances refinement and interior quality.\n\nSettle down, class. Inspired by the release of the new 2025 Subaru WRX tS, we’re learning about current production WRX variants, where they fall in the lineup and what they signal for the future of the brand. Nuh-uh! No moaning. I know Subaru’s trim lineup can be a mite confusing, but it all makes sense if you apply a bit of logic to it. But before we get into the new tS, we need to start at the beginning — or rather, the “base” version of the current-generation WRX.\n\nIt’s a somewhat controversial chapter of the WRX storybook, but understanding the core WRX makes understanding the rest simple, particularly from a powertrain perspective. All current-generation WRXs (base, TR, tS, GT) use the same turbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four-cylinder engine that makes 271 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. That’s right: No matter how much more you spend and what suffix appends your “WRX” badge, you command the same power as the basest-of-base WRX.\n\nRelated: 2025 Subaru WRX tS: A Handling Package for the WRX\n\nTR and tS: What’s the Difference?\n\nOutside of the manual-only TR and tS, buyers can also spec their new rallyista hotshot with a continuously variable automatic transmission, but the notchy six-speed manual is the most popular pick, according to Subaru. The range-topping WRX GT is perhaps the most controversial variant of the bunch, offering a heap of exclusive performance goodies like an adjustable suspension, Recaro seats and configurable drive modes, but not a manual transmission.\n\nWRXers were understandably upset. This 2025 WRX TR was a semi-effective salve for all of those chapped asses, living up to its “Tuner Ready” namesake with big honkin’ Brembo brakes at all four corners, retuned steering, a stiffer suspension, Bridgestone Potenza S007 summer tires and standard Recaro seats.\n\nGot it? Good — then the tS should be a cinch. The tS rumbles about with the same sticky Potenzas, wheels, Recaro seats, six-speed manual and Brembo brakes as the TR, but it incorporates the configurable drive modes of the GT and a set of electronically adjustable shocks tuned by STI.\n\nSTI, Aye Aye Aye\n\nThose three little letters make a welcome return with the tS, even if this is far from a full-on WRX STI that a large swath of Subie superfans desperately want. As it does on the BRZ sports car, tS stands for “Tuned by STI,” with enough fettling from Subaru’s storied motorsports division to earn “STI” branding on the tS’ new 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster.\n\nNow that we’re caught up, let’s talk about how the thing actually drives. I spent a week in a WRX TR roughly a month before I drove the tS, so I came mostly prepared; I’ve not driven the base WRX, nor have I wheeled a GT, but I’m told by those I trust that the TR’s retuned steering, suspension and beefy Brembos are significant leaps over the standard WRX, which was critiqued for light, artificial steering and a mushy suspension when compared to the prior generation.\n\nHardware Huddle\n\nOut on familiar canyon roads, the TR was impressively capable and hugely quick for a 3,400-pound, sub-300-hp four-door. Like the tS, power delivery is charmingly characteristic of the WRX species, with solid power sustained through the range cut with moments of strong boost. Even with a set of severely heat-cycled, track-chewed tires, my TR test car was tremendously grippy, with Subaru’s signature all-wheel drive pulling you through corners like a freight train.\n\nFor the most part, the only real mechanical criticism I had was the TR’s steering, which remained light and overly boosted despite the TR-specific upgrades. In the balance between daily usability and feelsome experience, the WRX TR still falls more on daily grins than weekend laughs — which, I suppose, is ultimately the holistic purpose of the WRX, with the ratio flipped for the erstwhile STI. The tS, then, presumably cuts the perfect 50-50 blend even with its untouched powertrain.\n\nDriving Dynamics\n\nFor the most part, it seems to be the best of all worlds — if and only if said worlds do not offer a full STI variant. The headline change here over the TR is that adjustable suspension and the drive modes; on the fast country roads weaving through California wine country, the new suspension noticeably managed body roll and overall body control when toggled into the stiffest Sport setting.\n\nFor roughly half of the street drive portion of the event, I left it in Sport, as that’s the setting each ignition cycle defaults to over the available Normal and Comfort modes. The biggest change is the Sport setting for the steering. It adds a nice shmear of increased effort over the TR’s overboosted feel but is still hardly a pain to use during low-speed maneuvers. Turn-in and actual steering performance is unaffected by the chosen mode; it’s simply a matter of how much effort is needed to turn the wheel.\n\nRegarding that intriguing Power Unit setting on the drive mode selection screen, that refers almost entirely to throttle sensitivity, with the Sport setting predictably increasing response. Still, even this most aggressive mode was a far cry from the ultra-touchy tuning of past STIs, and it would be my preferred state even when commuting.\n\nTrack Tango\n\nThe wine country ramble was just the aperitif for our time at Sonoma Raceway, where I brutalized my way through seven or eight laps in the tS. This was no chicaned lead-follow dance like some drive programs for media — we were given full rein of Sonoma during our allotted time — and as trackwork usually does, the weaknesses were emphasized while the on-road nuance took a backseat. I’ll say this: Outside of some wholly expected understeer in Sonoma’s tightest low-speed hairpins, the WRX tS was a commendably capable and predictable on-track car that carried speed well and offered no surprises or tricks that significantly separate it from the rest of the current WRX lineup.\n\nIt feels very much like the tip of the WRX family spear that it is, offering the most mechanical refinement and capability without overwhelming via adjustable differentials, touchy inputs and punishing sensations. Regardless of what you might hear from other enthusiasts, the core multitool character of the WRX remains; beyond an on-road driving experience that allowed my drive partner and I to zone out and cruise on the highway stretches and laugh during the slithering sections, Subaru staff routinely piled into support WRXs five folks deep to manage event logistics. The cars we whipped on track were the same ones we drove to and from the hotel basecamp, and wore bone-stock brake pads and Bridgestones for the full duration. Utility is a lovely thing when done right.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Subaru WRX TR Review: STI Lite\n2024 Subaru WRX TR: A More Focused Rex\n2024 Subaru WRX Gains Standard Safety Gear, Priced From $33,855\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nShop for a New Subaru WRX\nCost Analysis\n\nShould you get one? It depends. Let’s suppose the recent rumors of Subaru’s about-face with regards to no future WRX STI product holds oil and we’re only a year and change from some 400-hp hybrid super-Subie with a proper STI badge. We’re not privy to the 2025 tS’ pricing quite yet, but Subaru says it will be above the $42,775 (including destination) starting price of the TR, leading me to believe it will be priced around the $45,335 GT. This begs the question: Is there a genuine $11,000-plus difference between a base WRX and the tS?\n\nFor a hardcore Subaru enthusiast who wants to hedge their bets against a future STI — or cannot afford the likely $55,000-and-up price tag of this hypothetical car — the tS is a sure thing. For someone who is fine with the base WRX’s steering and is willing to go aftermarket for performance upgrades, consider doing just that — though a quality set of wheels, tires and brakes will rub awfully close to filling the $9,000-ish gulf between the base and TR trims, and you still won’t have the TR’s uprated suspension, retuned steering and Recaros (to say nothing of the tS’ adaptive suspension and digital gauge display).\n\nFor now, the tS is the deserved top of the food chain — just don’t get trim envy if and when Subaru reveals another WRX above and beyond yours.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new-for-2024 Subaru WRX TR trim brings a sharper edge to the regular WRX — for better and for worse.\n\nVersus the competition: In any of its available versions, the WRX’s standard all-wheel drive and distinctive rally-car-for-the-street personality help it stand out from other performance-focused compact cars.\n\nWhen Subaru fully redesigned its WRX compact sports sedan for the 2022 model year, it made the car quieter and significantly more refined than the previous-generation model. For at least a few performance-minded shoppers, however, the new-gen WRX might have been a little too refined. When Cars.com Managing Editor Joe Bruzek reviewed the car, he praised its improved ride quality and more easily accessible power, but he bemoaned its numb steering feel and lack of distinctive engine noise. Subaru also disappointed enthusiast buyers by canceling its previously announced plans to produce a next-generation version of the WRX’s hotter STI variant — at least one with a traditional gasoline engine.\n\nRelated: 2024 Subaru WRX Gains Standard Safety Gear, Priced From $33,855\n\nFor 2024, Subaru has aimed to rectify some of these issues with the introduction of the new WRX TR, a manual-transmission-only model that adds a bit more edginess and athleticism to the basic WRX formula. Subaru previously used the TR suffix on a stripped-down, budget-priced WRX trim that launched with the 2006 model; back then, the initials stood for “tuner-ready.” This time, TR unofficially stands for “track-ready,” as the new car is outfitted for enhanced performance on a track. The new TR is not a price leader; it’s actually the second-spendiest WRX in the lineup, slotting about $2,500 below the line-topping GT trim.\n\nI took a WRX TR on a 1,000-mile summer road trip to see how it compares with the rest of the WRX lineup, as well as with other performance-oriented compact cars.\n\nSTI Lite\n\nThe TR could be considered an “STI lite” version of the WRX. It gets an upgraded performance suspension for sharper handling, just like the departed STI, but unlike the STI, it doesn’t get a hotter engine. The swan-song 2021 WRX STI packed a high-output flat-four engine making 310 horsepower, but the 2024 TR has to make do with the same 271-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter flat-four that powers other WRXs.\n\nIn place of the 17- or 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels on other WRXs, though, the TR gets unique 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels fitted with Bridgestone Potenza S007 summer performance tires. The brakes are upsize Brembo units with six-piston calipers in front and two-piston calipers in the rear, the suspension gets stiffer springs and revised dampers, and the dual-pinion steering rack has been tuned for better responsiveness.\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nThe net effect of these changes is predictable: The TR feels sharper and more nimble in fast corners than its siblings, with excellent AWD grip from its sticky performance tires. The TR’s steering is accurate and quick, but as in the standard WRX, it isn’t quite as communicative or direct as I’d like; not much feedback comes through the column to the steering wheel. Other sporty compacts, like the Honda Civic Si and Hyundai Elantra N, have a more playful feel.\n\nBruzek felt the same way after driving this TR and comparing it with the 2022 WRX he originally reviewed:\n\n“Overall, the uneasiness on fast sweepers I reported in my 2022 WRX first drive is all but gone. That’s likely aided by the TR package, which also includes summer tires; the previous WRX I drove was equipped with all-season tires. What hasn’t gotten better (which I hoped would) is the lack of steering feel and feedback, as well as the minimal torque buildup in the steering wheel while you’re pushing harder into corners. It’s tough to know what the front tires are doing given how much road feel is isolated from the driver, which would be great if this were a family sedan or SUV. It’s not great for a performance car. There’s plenty of grip and athleticism in how the car handles, but it’s not reaching its maximum engagement with the driver because you feel isolated from the experience — while also questioning how much grip you have before it gets dicey and the car starts to slide (I didn’t get there on city streets). Because of this, I didn’t find it any more fun to drive than the standard WRX, though it was certainly more capable.”\n\nA lot of feedback comes from the tires in the form of road noise, however, and that can get pretty tiring on a long road trip. Though the TR’s ride isn’t outright stiff, it’s taut at all times, and its short-sidewall performance tires kick up a lot of racket at freeway speeds. Sometimes, the road noise seems to reverberate through the whole body structure, making it feel like the ride is stiffer than it actually is. On some stretches of Interstate 90 in Minnesota, with concrete surfaces and expansion cracks, road noise was so loud (ka-chonk ka-chonk ka-chonk) I had to turn up the stereo — and let out a sigh of relief when the pavement surface changed to something quieter.\n\nThe TR doesn’t get any kind of exhaust upgrades, but to my ears, our test vehicle sounded noticeably growlier than my memory of the 2022 WRX. This gave the car a more overt performance attitude, though it was loud enough on a late-night cold startup that I worried about annoying my neighbors. When cruising on the freeway with the engine speed around 2,700 rpm, the exhaust note settles into a drone that can grow wearisome (especially on top of that tire roar). Such compromises are part and parcel of driving a sharply tuned performance vehicle, though, and on shorter trips, the TR’s enhanced handling chops are a hoot. It’s fun to toss it into fast corners and use that AWD grip, and it’s fun to row through the six-speed manual transmission’s gears with the car’s agreeable shifter and clutch pedal.\n\nInterior Alterations\n\nInside, the TR gets Recaro front sport seats with synthetic-suede upholstery inserts and more pronounced bolstering than lesser WRX trims. The seat-bottom bolsters make getting in and out marginally trickier, because you have to slide your backside over them, but once I was seated, I didn’t find any of the bolsters overly confining; they held me snugly in place without feeling uncomfortable or constricting. The synthetic-suede upholstery, however, had me wishing the TR came with cooled or ventilated seats in addition to heated seats. The grippy suede helps keep your backside planted in aggressive driving, but it also gets uncomfortably warm on hot summer days — enough so that I had to lower the climate-control temp and turn up the fan to compensate.\n\nEven so, the WRX’s cabin is a pretty pleasant place to be. Interior materials and overall fit and finish are quite nice for a mainstream brand, and the red contrast stitching and swath of faux-suede upholstery on the dash give the interior a just-right sporty ambiance. Another plus for tall guys like me is that the TR deletes the moonroof that’s standard on the Limited and GT trims. Subaru says this is for weight savings and a lower center of gravity, but it also frees up a precious extra inch of front headroom.\n\nAnother plus is that Subaru has made its EyeSight suite of driver-assist and safety features standard on all WRXs for 2024 (EyeSight was previously available only on automatic-transmission models). It’s nice to have the additional driver aids — especially on a stick-shift car, where they’re not common — but I occasionally found the lane-centering steering feature to be so intrusive, I turned it off; the system added steering input when I didn’t want it to.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Subaru WRX TR: A More Focused Rex\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2025 Subaru WRX tS: A Handling Package for the WRX\nResearch the 2024 Subaru WRX\nShop for a 2024 Subaru WRX\nTR? Or Si, Type R, N, GR, GTI or R?\n\nThe WRX TR is part of a relatively robust class of hot-rod compact sedans and hatchbacks. Its $42,775 starting price (all prices include destination) is significantly more than the base WRX ($33,855), as well as the Honda Civic Si ($30,195) and a manual Hyundai Elantra N ($34,850). The Civic Si has only 200 hp, however, and neither the Si nor the Elantra N have AWD. The 315-hp Honda Civic Type R is a real front-wheel-drive track rat, but it starts at $45,890 and is more high-strung in day-to-day driving than the WRX TR. The 241-hp Volkswagen Golf GTI’s lineup is priced similarly to the WRX’s, but the GTI is also FWD-only. The top-dog VW Golf R has AWD and 315 hp, but it starts at $46,890. At $37,635 to start, the Toyota GR Corolla is also pricier than a base WRX, but it boasts standard driver-adjustable AWD and a 300-hp, turbocharged three-cylinder engine.\n\nAll of those cars are solid rivals of the WRX in their own ways, but none match its rally-car-for-the-street character. If you’re looking for something spicier than the standard WRX but find the TR’s ride a bit too taut, you might want to wait for the recently announced 2025 WRX tS; it gets the TR’s upgrades but also adds an adaptive-damper suspension with driver-selectable Comfort, Normal and Sport modes. This adaptive suspension was previously only on the line-topping WRX GT trim, and it should make the tS a bit more comfortable in everyday driving than the TR.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
