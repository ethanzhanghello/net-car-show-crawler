      "expert_review": "Competes with: Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID.4, Tesla Model Y, Toyota bZ4X\n\nLooks like: Toyota bZ4X\n\nPowertrains: 215-horsepower dual electric motors with a lithium-ion battery pack; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: 2022\n\nThe Subaru Solterra made its first appearance on the global stage last week, and now we have more details on the U.S. version of the all-electric SUV as it debuts at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show. The Solterra will mark a series of firsts for Subaru: In addition to being the brand’s first all-electric vehicle, the SUV will come with new safety features such as an available 360-degree camera system. Like the other SUVs in its lineup, the Solterra also promises to offer mild off-roading capability with standard all-wheel drive and generous ground clearance.\n\nRelated: More 2021 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nA Closer Look Around\n\nWe caught the first glimpse of the Solterra during its global reveal, but now Subaru has revealed more details (and photos) of the U.S.-bound model. The Solterra was jointly developed by Subaru and Toyota, and shares a new e-Subaru Global Platform and many styling elements with its cousin, the Toyota bZ4X.\n\nThe Solterra sports a heavily creased and angular exterior, with a low hood and thin A-pillars intended to optimize forward visibility. In front, a hexagonal grille motif is framed by the vehicle’s thin LED headlights that come with standard high-beam assist. The vehicle’s profile features short front and rear overhangs and a sharply sloped roof; large wheel arch moldings hint at its off-road capability.\n\nIn contrast to the origami-inspired exterior, the Solterra’s interior is minimalistic and tech-focused with a large, upright touchscreen display and digital top-mounted instrument panels. Subaru says cargo and passenger space is optimized thanks to a flat floor, folding rear seats and a wide liftgate opening that should make loading gear easier.  A panoramic glass roof along with raised roof rails will be available.\n\nPower and Charging\n2023 Subaru Solterra | Manufacturer image\n\nPowered by a lithium-ion battery pack and dual motors, the Solterra produces 215 horsepower and 248 pounds-feet of torque. It offers Level 2 AC and DC fast charging capability with a Subaru-estimated range of over 220 miles on a full charge.\n\nAlthough the 220-mile range is competitive among the list of EVs with the longest range, the Solterra’s estimated range falls short of its direct competitors. The Volkswagen ID.4 gets an estimated 260-mile range in rear-wheel drive models and up to 249 miles for AWD; the Ford Mustang Mach-E gets up to 305 miles in RWD and 270 miles in AWD.\n\nThe Toyota bZ4X will be offered in the U.S. with front-wheel drive or AWD; FWD models get a Toyota-estimated 250 miles of range, while range estimates for the AWD models have not yet been determined. A long-range Tesla Model Y leads the entire pack with an EPA-estimated range of 326 miles.\n\nTech and Safety Firsts\n2023 Subaru Solterra | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Solterra’s multimedia system is accessed through an available 12.3-inch touchscreen with standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and wireless charging. The EV is the first Subaru vehicle to offer a 360-degree surround-view camera, and it also gets Subaru’s new standard Safety Exit Alert system that warns passengers of potential obstacles before they exit via visual and audible alerts.\n\nAdditional driver-assist features include standard automatic pre-collision braking, automatic pre-collision throttle management, lane departure warning, and a blind spot monitor with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nOff-Road Capability\n2023 Subaru Solterra | Manufacturer image\n\nFollowing the lead of Subaru’s current SUVs, the Solterra comes with standard AWD (U.S. version) and utilizes Subaru’s on-demand torque technology with driver-selectable regenerative modes. Intended for off-roading, hill climbs and slippery pavement, the driver-activated X-Mode adds more stability and grip by adjusting the SUV’s power output, AWD torque split and brake system. Subaru’s grip control also helps navigate steep grades with hill ascent and descent assist. The Solterra has 8.3 inches of ground clearance, which is slightly less than the Crosstrek and Outback’s 8.7 inches.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Subaru Solterra is expected to arrive in the U.S. in summer 2022, with a starting pricing of $46,220 (all prices include destination but exclude any tax credits).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nSubaru Solterra All-Electric SUV Debuts in Japan, Bound for U.S.\n2023 Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ4X: 4 Things We Hope to See From the Toyobaru EVs\nSubaru Sheds More Light on Upcoming 2023 Solterra All-Electric SUV\nSubaru Solterra Electric SUV to Arrive in 2022\nHere Are the New Electric Vehicles Planned by 2025\nToyota’s All-Electric bZ4X Concept Launches ‘Beyond Zero’ Brand\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Subaru’s first all-electric vehicle doesn’t really stand out — not from its Toyota bZ4X counterpart and not in terms of driving range or charging time, though it’s still a reasonably well-rounded compact SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: Like the bZ4X, the Solterra has its charms, but almost every rival electric SUV offers a superior driving range and lower starting price — and some boast notably quicker charging speeds.\n\nFor the 2023 model year, Subaru dipped a big toe into the electric-vehicle market with the introduction of its first EV, the Solterra compact SUV. It didn’t, however, jump all the way into the water: The Solterra doesn’t represent the same kind of investment into the volatile EV segment as, say, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E or Hyundai’s Ioniq 5. It’s essentially a badge-engineered version of the Toyota bZ4X, which also debuted for 2023 as Toyota’s first mainstream EV available in all 50 states.\n\nRelated: Here Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\n\nThe Solterra looks and feels like even more of a brand outlier in Subaru’s lineup than the company’s other joint venture with Toyota, the BRZ sports car. That car is Subaru’s version of the Toyota GR86, but at least it has Subaru’s signature horizontally opposed “boxer” engine. The Solterra’s exterior styling is nearly identical to its Toyota counterpart’s, but with unique touches like a front-end design that features a Subaru-style grille shape, flat-finish wheel-arch moldings in place of the bZ4X’s glossy ones, and unique wheels and (of course) badging.\n\nThe Solterra also sticks to Subaru tradition by coming only with all-wheel drive (the bZ4X is available with either front-wheel drive or AWD). Subaru positions the Solterra as an off-road-capable vehicle by touting its 8.3-inch ground clearance — which is generous among mainstream compact SUVs but only .2 inches more than the bZ4X — as well as X-Mode functions that include hill descent control and Snow/Dirt and Deep Snow/Mud drive modes.\n\nI recently drove a 2024 Subaru Solterra in its top-line Touring trim on a weeklong family vacation in Southern California. I didn’t get the chance to take it off-pavement or charge it on a DC fast charger (where Subaru says its performance is significantly improved for 2024), but I did get a good taste of its capabilities in daily-grind family hauls. Because the Solterra is so similar to the bZ4X, you can check out our review of the 2023 bZ4X for more information and perspective.\n\nSimple Model Lineup\n\nThe Solterra lineup consists of entry-level Premium and mid-line Limited trims in addition to the Touring. The Premium comes well equipped for a base trim, with standard features like keyless entry and start, dual-zone climate control, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and heated front seats. Its roster of standard safety equipment includes expected features plus reverse automatic braking and, new for 2024, front cross-traffic alert and a hands-free traffic jam assist system. The hands-free driving system operates at speeds up to 25 mph and will maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, as well as keep the Solterra centered in its lane and make automated lane changes in response to the driver activating the turn signal.\n\nThe Limited adds features like a power liftgate, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, a Harman Kardon audio system, a wireless charging pad, synthetic leather upholstery in place of cloth seats and a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen in place of the Premium’s 8-inch touchscreen. The Touring further steps things up via a panoramic moonroof, ventilated front seats (in addition to heated), additional interior lighting and a rearview camera mirror that provides an unobstructed rear view when passengers or cargo are blocking the traditional mirror.\n\nDecent Pep, Mediocre Range and Charging\n\nThe Solterra’s sole powertrain configuration is a dual 80-kilowatt-motor setup that’s powered by a 72.8-kilowatt-hour battery. It’s rated at 215 horsepower and 249 pounds-feet of torque, which is enough for respectably zippy acceleration given the instant-torque response of an electric motor. Dip heavily into the accelerator pedal and the Solterra gets moving right away, making it easy to zip into open spots in traffic or merge into fast-moving expressway traffic.\n\nLike many EVs, the Solterra has driver-selectable settings for regenerative-braking intensity. I preferred the most aggressive setting; it isn’t quite one-pedal driving (I almost always had to use the brake pedal to come to a complete stop), but it’s close. Unfortunately, every time the vehicle is restarted, it reverts to the weakest regen setting, so you’ll have to manually select the higher setting again via the steering-wheel-mounted paddles.\n\nThe Solterra’s EPA-estimated driving range is 227 miles for the Premium and 222 miles for the Limited and Touring (the 5-mile hit is due to the higher trims’ standard 20-inch wheels and tires versus the Premium’s 18-inchers). My Touring test vehicle was on par with this rating; it showed a driving range of 217 miles on a full charge when I first received it and 225 miles after I charged it to full overnight on a friend’s Level 2 home charger. These aren’t great numbers among modern electric compact SUVs; AWD versions of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model Y offer long-range batteries and do significantly better, at 300 and 310 miles, respectively. Comparable versions of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 also best the Solterra, though not as dramatically, at 260 and 252 miles, respectively. (On the EV6, swapping out 20-inch wheels for 19-inchers ups that number to 282 miles.)\n\nSubaru says the Solterra’s DC fast-charging and cold-weather charging performance have been improved for 2024: Subaru says the time it takes to fast-charge from 10% to 80% has dropped from around 60 minutes to as little as 35 minutes. That’s obviously better, but it’s still not as quick as some rivals; the Ioniq 5 and EV6, for example, can fast-charge from 10% to 80% in less than 20 minutes under ideal circumstances thanks to their 800-volt charging architecture.\n\nCabin Quirks\n\nThe Solterra’s interior layout is the same as the bZ4X’s, and both have some unorthodox design choices that drivers may or may not find awkward. The digital gauge cluster is mounted high and very far forward on the dash, essentially splitting the difference between a traditional gauge cluster and a head-up display projected on the windshield. The panel is meant to be viewed over the top of the steering wheel rather than between the rim and hub of the wheel, but the payoff will vary quite a bit between drivers of different heights and seating-position preferences.\n\nFor 2024, the Solterra gets a “squircle” steering wheel instead of a traditional round one — a feature not shared with the bZ4X. The squared-off shape makes for a better sight line to the gauge cluster (because the upper portion of the steering-wheel rim is less likely to block the view of the panel), and it also frees up a bit of knee and leg room under the wheel for tall drivers like me. Still, I found the gauge cluster’s placement a bit awkward, and I wish it took better advantage of its digital screen by offering more configuration options and alternate readouts.\n\nOther cabin quirks include no glove box or rear window wiper. I really missed having a rear wiper when driving in a rainstorm, and while Subaru includes a camera washer for the rearview camera mirror, it’s a small consolation. The wireless device charger is covered by a hinged lid and placed somewhat awkwardly smack in the middle of the center console, where it takes up a lot of real estate.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Subaru Solterra Receives Charging Upgrades, Priced From $46,340\n2024 Toyota bZ4X Gains Standard Comfort, Convenience Tech\n2025 Subaru Forester Review: Redesigned, But on the Same Not-So-Beaten Path\nResearch the 2024 Subaru Solterra\nShop for a New Subaru Solterra\n\nThe Solterra’s front and rear cross-traffic alert warning chimes seemed to be set to hair-trigger sensitivity; I found them more irritating than helpful. The backup warning chime when the vehicle is in Reverse (likely a necessity because of the unconventional rotary shift knob) was distracting, too.\n\nThe climate-control panel is a blend of easy-to-use physical controls and capacitive-touch buttons. They all worked well, but I found the ventilated front seats to be subpar — an issue I’ve noticed in several Toyota vehicles. The ventilator fans don’t cool the seat very much, if at all; it even felt at times that the ventilation function was actually making my seat warmer.\n\nGenerous Space, Middle-of-the-Road Driving Dynamics\n\nThe seats themselves are comfortable, and occupant space is quite good for average-sized adults both up front and in back. Though the angled rear roofline cuts a bit into the Solterra’s maximum cargo volume, the cargo space is laudably spacious, with a low, wide load floor and rear seatbacks that fold nearly flat to open up a larger, unbroken space for extra-large items.\n\nLike the bZ4X, the Solterra’s suspension is tuned for a daily commute, not corner-carving.  Relatively porky curb weights are pretty much the norm with EVs thanks to their heavy batteries, and you definitely get a sense of the vehicle’s heft in quick corners, but the Solterra’s handling is composed and predictable overall. Ride quality is decent even with the 20-inch wheels, but I noticed an intrusive amount of tire roar when traveling over some freeway surfaces.\n\nValue\n\nThe Solterra’s pricing is on par with similar all-electric AWD SUVs. It starts at $46,340 in its base Premium trim, $49,840 for the Limited and $53,340 for the Touring (all prices include $1,345 destination). If nothing else, the Solterra serves as a workable stopgap to the expected Subaru-built EVs of the future, which might kick off with an all-new electric version of the WRX STI performance car.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Subaru Solterra?\n\nThe Subaru Solterra is an electric compact SUV that’s closely related to the Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ. While those SUVs are available with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive, the Solterra follows Subaru convention and is only offered with AWD provided by electric motors front and rear. The motors generate a combined 215 horsepower, and its driving range tops out at 227 miles. The bZ4X aside, competitors include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Volkswagen ID.4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Subaru Solterra?\n\nA new Touring Onyx Edition trim level tops the Solterra lineup for 2025. It gets black wheels and accents inside and out but is otherwise identical to the regular Touring. Across the line, the 2025 Solterra is significantly cheaper — by at least $6,500 — than the 2024 model.\n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Subaru Solterra Have?\n\nThe entry-level Solterra Premium has an EPA-estimated driving range of 227 miles. The rest of the lineup can go an estimated 222 miles on a full charge.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Subaru Solterra?\n\nOn a typical Level 2 home charger, the Solterra needs about 9.5 hours to replenish its battery. It can charge to 80% in as little as 35 minutes on a DC fast charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Subaru Solterra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry and start\nCloth seats\nHeated front seats\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic reverse braking\nLane-centering steering\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear cross-traffic alert\nEmergency steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated outboard rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nVentilated front seats\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nHarman Kardon audio system\nWireless phone charging\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Subaru Solterra?\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Solterra is spacious and comfortable, but its power and driving range trail most competitive electric vehicles. An updated 2026 Solterra, however, will offer up to 338 hp and be able to travel more than 285 miles on a charge; shoppers who need more range or want more power may want to wait for the improved Solterra to go on sale. If a range in the low 200s is sufficient for your needs, though, the 2026 model’s imminent arrival might increase your chances of getting a good deal on a 2025 Solterra.",

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Subaru Solterra a Good Electric SUV?\n\nThe redesigned Solterra is certainly much more competitive, with more power (including a new XT variant with 338 horsepower), significantly more range, improved charging capabilities and a new Tesla-style North American Charging Standard. Pretty much everything that could be improved was.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Subaru Solterra Compare With Other Electric SUVs?\n\nWhile its significant upgrades make the new Solterra much better than the first-generation model, they don’t do anything to raise the ceiling of the segment. Rather, they raise the floor. A Ford Mustang Mach-E is a bit sportier with longer available range, the Volkswagen ID.4 is more comfortable on-road, and the well-rounded Hyundai Ioniq 5 remains a leader in the class. But seeing a Solterra on the road will no longer elicit surprise — at least if it’s the new one.\n\nSubaru announced the redesigned 2026 Solterra this year, and it impressed us when we first saw it in person. The second-generation Solterra, like the first, is the result of a joint venture between Subaru and Toyota, and it shares much of its improvements with its 2026 Toyota bZ cousin. Those include battery, efficiency, charging and interior tech updates that make the Solterra much more than just a vehicle that lets Subaru tick the “sells an electric vehicle” box. And the Solterra, unlike the bZ, comes exclusively with dual-motor all-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: Updated 2026 Subaru Solterra EV Boasts More Than 285 Miles of Range\n\nTo find out as much as I could about the 2026 Solterra’s improvements — and to give it something of a quick and dirty efficiency test — I headed to Denver to drive the new Solterra on twisty mountain roads both paved and unpaved, on highways and even on a light off-road course (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRead on to learn how the Solterra performed.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Solterra’s Power, Range and Charging Stats?\n\nStats matter for EVs, though it’s never a guarantee that an EV will always deliver on its promises. But when the previous Solterra had less than 230 miles of EPA-estimated range in every configuration, a maximum power output of 215 horsepower and a maximum DC fast-charging rate of 100 kilowatts, it never even offered on-paper competitiveness. Compare those numbers to these:\n\n2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium AWD Extended Range\n\n370 hp\n300 miles of range\n150-kW max DC fast-charging rate\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL AWD\n\n320 hp\n290 miles of range\n235-kW max DC fast-charging rate\n\n2025 Volkswagen ID.4 AWD Pro S\n\n335 hp\n263 miles of range\n175-kW max DC fast-charging rate\n\nCompared with its predecessor, the 2026 Solterra improves on every single one of these stats, with an estimated 288 (Premium) or 278 (Limited, Limited XT and Touring XT) miles of range, 233 or 338 (XT) hp, and a 150-kW DC fast-charging rate. Not one of those specs blows away the Ford, Hyundai or Volkswagen (if they exceed them at all), but at least they’re all competitive now.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWhen I started driving, the Solterra Touring XT’s battery was at 100%, and it was showing 280 miles of range — slightly more than its estimated 278 miles. After 121.3 miles of extremely mixed-use driving (including heavy climate-control use, various driving modes and even an off-road course), I’d used 42% of the battery’s charge. The range estimate was now 149 miles, meaning I’d used 131 miles of range — fairly accurate, but not perfect.\n\nI did not, however, get to test the new Solterra’s charging capabilities during my time with it. We’ll have to wait until we have one at our home offices in Chicago for a more thorough evaluation.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Subaru Solterra Drive?\n\nThe Solterra’s driving experience is fairly pedestrian for an EV. I drove a Touring XT, which Subaru says can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds. That makes it the quickest model in the automaker’s lineup, but it’s not all that quick in the world of EVs. While there’s far more power than in the last Solterra, flooring the accelerator pedal hardly pushes you into your seat. The added power is more noticeable on the highway, where there is now enough reserve power for worry-free passing and merging.\n\nRide comfort is adequate, even with my test vehicle’s 20-inch wheels and tires (18s are standard on the Premium). Washboard gravel roads made the Solterra shudder, but it never felt out of control. The standard dual-motor AWD system — retuned for 2026 for better power distribution and control — and the car’s driver-assist features made getting sideways even on dirt hairpins difficult.\n\nBraking feel is solid and linear enough, and while there are five regenerative-braking settings (four if you don’t count “none” as a setting), there is no true one-pedal driving mode. Fortunately, Subaru has tuned the regen admirably, and it’s easy to seamlessly transition from the strongest setting to braking to a full stop with the brake pedal without stopping short and throwing everyone and everything in the car forward. Annoyingly, Subaru has not figured out that drivers might like to keep their regen-braking setting from drive to drive; when the Solterra is turned on again after stopping, it reverts to the weakest “on” setting.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Subaru Solterra Drive Off-Road?\n\nSubaru is quick to point out the 2026 Solterra has 8.3 inches of ground clearance, and with its standard AWD and dual-mode X-Mode terrain settings, it’s more than capable of tackling the average owner’s off-roading needs — and then some. The course we drove was narrow but not especially challenging, based on my experience, and the Solterra had no issues with the uneven, undulating and loose terrain. The Solterra is not a dedicated off-road rig, but it is a Subaru.\n\nMore Subaru Solterra News From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Subaru Solterra Up Close: Meaningfully Updated, Nearly Competitive\nIs the 2025 Subaru Solterra a Good EV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\n2025 Subaru Solterra Gets Significantly Lower Starting Price, New Trim\n2024 Subaru Solterra Review: A bZ4X by Another Name?\nSubaru Latest Brand to Adopt Tesla Charging Standard\nHow Good Is the 2026 Subaru Solterra’s Interior?\n\nInside the Solterra, improvements include a new 14-inch touchscreen — Subaru’s biggest ever and vastly superior to the portrait-oriented displays found in many other current Subaru models. If it’s different from Toyota’s 14-inch infotainment display in any meaningful way, I couldn’t tell. It’s responsive and intuitive enough, and the graphics are crisp.\n\nA new, wider center console now houses two wireless device chargers. It’s a nice design, but over the course of my driving, I found it irritated my right knee. I’m 6-foot-1, and taller drivers may find this even more annoying. Backseat room was good for someone of my height even behind my preferred driving position. Cargo space should be more than adequate for smaller families or folks with pets, but I’m looking forward to measuring the cargo area ourselves to see how it compares with other SUVs.\n\nShould You Buy the 2026 Subaru Solterra?\n\nWith a competitive feature set and spec sheet — and assuming competitive pricing (it wasn’t available as of publication) — the 2026 Subaru Solterra is definitely worth your consideration if you’re shopping for an electric compact SUV. If it can deliver on its improved charging and range in the real world — and currently we have no reason to believe it won’t — it’s better than its predecessor in every conceivable way. While it’s not necessarily vastly better than any of its chief competitors, there’s a chance it could be a relative bargain.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
