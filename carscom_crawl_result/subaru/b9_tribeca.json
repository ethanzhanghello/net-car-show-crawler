      "expert_review": "I distinctly remember the first time I saw a Subaru B9 Tribeca. I remember because I was taken back by the Cyrano De Bergerac like proboscis (big ol’ snout, for those less interested in the dramatic arts) on what is usually the grille of a car. It wasn’t until I drove the B9 Tribeca that I actually “got it”. That honker is supposed to look like the area of an airplane where the propeller goes. Obviously that is not an easy leap for my mind to make, Once I’d made the jump, I recognized it everywhere in the B9 Tribeca.\n\nSitting in the driver’s seat is like sitting in a cockpit. Even the lines of the dash mimic wings. I am comfortably tucked into my seat with all of the controls and gauges set out before me. There are so many things to look at that I feel distracted. At second glance, the controls are fairly easy to interpret and I have no problem figuring out how to run the air conditioner or even the navigation system. I do have some trouble, however, when I want to use any of the buttons that are directly in front of the gearshift. My hand has to bend at a weird angle to get the air in the car to re-circulate – maybe that is an aeronautical thing as well.\n\nThe back-up camera employs features I associate with airplanes. When I place the car in reverse the back-up camera shows the space behind me and also outlines the area with green, yellow and red runway lighting to show me how close an object is to being smashed. I test this feature in a small parking lot where someone has parked a testosterone-truck (you know the kind…) in a space just across the aisle from the Subaru. I rely on the camera to tell me if I am green, yellow, or red. Let me tell you girlfriend, do not get to the red – objects in your rear view camera are closer than they appear. Luckily I did not leave my good judgment at home this particular morning, so I didn’t actually find out how that enormous trailer hitch looks going through the back window – phew. I am a big fan of back-up cameras but, as I told my soon-to-be-driving teenager, the camera will never replace my eyes or my critical thinking skills (wow, I sound like my mom – scary).\n\nThe navigation system in the Subaru B9 Tribeca is almost as good as having a co-pilot. Its voice commands can easily be turned on or off, so I don’t have to listen to an annoying woman’s voice tell me where to turn. My only complaint is with the Point-of-Interest portion of the navigation system. I want to find a coffee joint near my parent’s house so I press the restaurant category button, then it asks me for the name of the business I am looking to find – huh? If I knew the name, I would not have gone through the category menu. Needless to say, I type in Starbucks and I am rewarded, but if I want to find a local java hot-spot I would be hard pressed to find a list in this system. Bummer.\n\nThe small folks in the passenger portion of the cabin are pretty comfortable in the second row. They can easily view the landscape from their window seats and even enjoy the in-flight movie on a long day of errands. It is not until we embark on a journey with additional carpool guests that I hear the complaints. The third row seats have such little foot room that my good-natured 5-year-old begins crying – his feet are literally squished and he can’t even pull them up to put himself in the crash position because they are stuck. I pull the car over and move the second row seat forward only to find that my 15-year-old carpool guest must now move to the center position to get a spot that will accommodate his knees. Long story short, the seven-passenger model rivals the airlines’ economy class for comfort.\n\nI am impressed with the attention Subaru has paid to the airliner theme of the B9 Tribeca. As a matter of fact, even Wonder Woman’s airplane doesn’t have this much thematic integrity. It is a very functional aircraft, I mean vehicle, and my kids appreciate all flights, even those close to the ground.\n\n*For more information on the Subaru B9 Tribeca and its safety features visit Cars.com\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Kids can be so cruel.\n\nIn our urban elementary school, too many years ago for me to admit, one enduring insult was to run around some hapless little soul hollering: “Pig Nose! Pig Nose!”\n\nSo with some reluctance, I note the controversial snoot of the Subaru B9 Tribeca. There’s no gentle way to say this: Tribeca has a pig nose. advertisement\n\nNot an ugly pig nose, mind you. Just a cute, little pug in the middle of its face. This is the signature grille adopted by Subaru for its latest vehicles. For some people, it’s too weird, while others see a classic European shield style.\n\nSaddled with an unwieldy name as well as a pig nose, B9 Tribeca is Subaru’s first entry into the sport-utility arena, an area the automaker has resisted even though all its cars have all-wheel drive. Subaru was arguably the inventor of the SUV crossover, with Forester and Outback station wagons, and Tribeca follows suit as an SUV built on a car chassis.\n\nTribeca is the biggest Subie ever, and the first to offer seven-passenger seating, although those inhabiting the rear-most seat had better be really small folk.\n\nThe Japanese automaker also is trying to move upscale, and Tribeca’s lavish interior, high level of luxury features and substantial base price of $31,000 show that upward movement. The Limited version tested here included enough optional features, including DVD video and navigation systems, to push the price tag close to $40,000.\n\nTribeca has plenty of appeal, with superior drivability and Subaru’s reputation for durability, and despite the pig nose, it’s a fine new entry in the strongest part of the SUV market.\n\n– – –\n\nThe lowdown\n\nPERFORMANCE: The horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine, in which three cylinders lie horizontally on either side of the crankshaft, puts out plenty of power for its 3-liter displacement. Tribeca is a heavy craft but accelerates nicely behind 250 horsepower.\n\nAll Subarus use either four- or six-cylinder “boxer” engines, so called because the pistons seem like fighters’ fists duking it out. Like all these engines, Tribeca’s mill performs smoothly, although it sets up an agricultural roar when you hit the throttle.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Tribeca handles nicely, especially for this class of vehicle, with part of the credit going to the low center of gravity of the boxer engine.\n\nThe SUV also has a full load of electronic drivability enhancements, including “symmetrical” all-wheel drive, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and brake-force distribution and vehicle dynamics control.\n\nSTYLING: Other than the pig nose, Tribeca has a nicely sculpted shape and a sporty look, somewhat akin to Volkswagen Touareg.\n\nINTERIOR: The dashboard is an interesting wrap-around design that looks both space age and luxurious. Truck guys may find the high style too frou-frou, although it should have plenty of appeal for women.\n\nThe controls are nicely designed and come easily to hand, and the materials all feel high quality. Tribeca comes standard with a full collection of luxury and convenience features.\n\nFront-seat space is good, and the middle row moves fore and aft for legroom. But for the small third seat to be usable requires the middle seat to be far forward.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Another nicely turned-out vehicle for Subaru, which has gained many fans during the past decade with its solid all-wheel-drive passenger vehicles as well as its high-performance Impreza WRX sport compact.\n\n– – –\n\nRELATED\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door sport-utility crossover, all-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 3-liter horizontally opposed six, 250 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 219 pound-feet of torque at 4,200 rpm.\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 108.2 inches.\n\nOverall length: 189.8 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,225 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 18 city, 23 highway.\n\nHighs: Good drivability, lush interior, engine power.\n\nLows: Engine roar, teeny third seat, pig nose.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $33,895.\n\nPrice as tested: $39,003.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* DVD rear-video entertainment system, navigation system, audio upgrades, $3,800.\n\n* Auto-dimming mirror, compass, security sensor, $293.\n\n* Puddle lights, $229.\n\n* Cargo net, rear compartment cover, cargo tray, $161.\n\n* Shipping, $625.\n\n– – –\n\nFor more about the Subaru B9 Tribeca, go to autos.azcentral.com.",
