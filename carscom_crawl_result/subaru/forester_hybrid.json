      "expert_review": "Is the Subaru Forester Hybrid a Good SUV?\n\nWith a fully mechanical all-wheel-drive system, familiar flat-four drivetrain and improved performance over its gas-only sibling, the all-new 2025 Forester Hybrid is sure to be a megahit for Subaru, even if efficiency and performance lags behind class competitors.\n\nHow Does the Subaru Forester Hybrid Compare With Other SUVs?\n\nWith an EPA rating of 35/34/35 mpg city/highway/combined, the 2025 Forester Hybrid’s gas mileage trails the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and Honda CR-V hybrid, but its baked-in off-road capability and traditional Subaru appeal mean that loyalists wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThis one’s easy: In the market for a 2025 Subaru Forester? The new hybrid’s the one to get, full stop. I dig the standard non-hybrid Forester, which Subaru redesigned for 2025; it’s great. But, if you seek better efficiency, power and performance, the hybrid version is a no-brainer. Other than the higher purchase price, there is quite literally no downside to baggin’ the battery.\n\nSeriously. I’d suggest that if you’re mapping out a budget for your Forester purchase, tuck away roughly $1,500 to $3,500, depending on the trim level, to upgrade to the equivalent hybrid version. This is all entirely contingent on you being relatively locked in on a Forester — but we’ll address that a bit later.\n\nRelated: 2025 Subaru Forester Review: Redesigned, But on the Same Not-So-Beaten Path\n\nWhat MPG Does the Subaru Forester Hybrid Get?\n\nFor now, the headline figures are good. Subaru claims up to a 40% increase in city fuel efficiency over the gas-only Forester, and its 35 mpg combined rating is 6 mpg better than the next-closest gas Forester. Compared with the competition, however, these figures are fine at best, with the 2025 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid reigning as the segment’s eco-king at an EPA-rated 41/38/39 mpg, followed by the Hyundai Tucson Hybrid Blue at 38/38/38 mpg and the Honda CR-V hybrid AWD at 40/34/37 mpg.\n\nInteresting. Despite a fully developed and implemented hybrid system, the Forester Hybrid drags behind the competition in efficiency and power. The dirty secret here is that some Subaruness gets in the way of, ah, Subaru; like (nearly) every Subie in production, the Forester Hybrid retains the automaker’s signature symmetrical all-wheel-drive system.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nIs the Subaru Forester Hybrid Good Off-Road?\n\nEschewing the electric-motor-based AWD system employed by the RAV4 Hybrid, the juiced-up Forester Hybrid retains a mechanical, clutch-based differential system that ultimately adds weight and complexity that saps efficiency. And it must be said that I am positively tickled pink that it retains this system, as the Forester has long been one of the most capable soft-roaders out of the box.\n\nI know that the Subaru community will gladly take this efficiency hit if it means the Forester’s (comparably) impressive overland capability remains untouched. And, so it is: Even with the additional lithium-ion battery pack and hybrid components, the Forster Hybrid rides high with the same 8.7 inches of ground clearance as the regular Forester, which is more than some configurations of the Ford F-150 pickup.\n\nThis, combined with Subaru’s clever AWD tuning, meant that we ran into no trouble out on some moderate two-track trails winding through a California off-highway vehicle park. Some of the ascents and surfaces wouldn’t really trouble some of the less capable competition, but that impressive ground clearance and effortlessly confident AWD system meant we cruised through moderate obstacles and mixed terrain that would petrify your average SUV driver.\n\nHow Does the Subaru Forester Hybrid Drive On-Road?\n\nOn-road character is far more important, of course. A naturally aspirated 2.5-liter flat-four engine provides the core of the powertrain, augmented by two transmission-mounted electric motors and the aforementioned battery for a combined 194 horsepower. This is a mere 14 hp more than the gas-only Forester’s boxer engine, but the hybrid system’s torque delivers merging and passing capability that might not set an STI driver’s vape on fire but will let you hit highway speeds with less anxiety (and aural gnash) compared with the regular Forester.\n\nReally, the Forester Hybrid’s party trick is not feeling much like a hybrid at all. There is little “handoff” between the electric motor and the gas powertrain, instead feeling more like a seamless augmentation than a two-party system. I dig that — hybrids can too often feel jumbled and frustratingly overcomplex, particularly at the top of the automotive market. The Forester Hybrid’s only noticeable hybridization tell is its brake pedal; the balance between the regenerative and physical brakes is mostly well done, with a low enough threshold between both so as to significantly lower the learning curve for first-time hybrid drivers.\n\nThere is also a bit of bulk felt during more aggressive driving, with the hybrid cracking the scales at around 300 pounds more than the equivalent non-hybrid Forester. A maximum curb weight of 3,946 pounds for a Forester Touring Hybrid means it’s hardly a blubberbutt, but it’s something to be aware of.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nSubaru Targets Class Leaders With 2025 Forester Hybrid\n2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid Up Close: More of a Good Thing\nHow Much Is the New 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid?\nAuto Show Faceoff: How Do the 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid and 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Compare?\nShop for a 2025 Subaru Forester Near You\nHow Much Does the Subaru Forester Hybrid Cost?\n\nAlso something to keep in mind: With a base price of $36,415, including destination, the Forester Hybrid is roughly $2,500 more than a base 2025 RAV4 Hybrid but is less efficient and less powerful. For those considering their first Subaru purchase, the on-paper choice will be easy, with the RAV4 Hybrid coming out ahead most of the time. However, the Subaru faithful are fiercely loyal and rarely rational, prioritizing continuity when it comes to the driving experience, environment and presentation. Once a Subaru fan, always a Subaru fan — so I betcha this is gonna do big numbers.\n\nRegardless, it serves as a juicy preview to Subaru hybrids to come, specifically the 2026 Crosstrek Hybrid and the next-gen Outback and Ascent that are expected to follow suit in the near future. Until then, look for the 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid as your top choice for your next eco-minded outdoorsy SUV — go ahead, jump in!
