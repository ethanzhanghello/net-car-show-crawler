      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2011 about the 2011 Subaru Tribeca. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSubaru is on a roll, with recent redesigns of the Forester, Outback and Legacy earning recognition from Cars.com editors and consumers alike for their value and how competitive they are within their segments. Another all-new Subaru — the 36-mpg 2012 Impreza — will debut this summer, leaving one Subaru that seems to have been forgotten: the seven-seat Tribeca crossover SUV.\n\nThe 2011 Subaru Tribeca shines when it comes to ride quality and safety ratings, but its smaller size and outdated interior hold it back compared with three-row crossover rivals.\n\nIn fact, the Tribeca doesn’t seem to be quite the value other Subarus are. (See three-row crossovers compared.) Tribecas come in base Premium, midlevel Limited and loaded Touring trim levels. I drove a Touring. All come standard with a six-cylinder engine, automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nInside\nThe interior’s design has aged well over the years, with a smooth, curvy flow that wraps around front passengers. That’s quite the feat considering it’s essentially the same design used when this car was introduced as the B9 Tribeca for 2006.\n\nHowever, the quality of the materials in there is far from the segment’s best. There’s an overuse of silver plastic that’s meant to imitate aluminum — a cheap-looking trick. The dashboard and center console are carved out of the stuff, and they don’t do the unique design any justice.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the interior, though, is the lack of a telescoping steering wheel, which is found in just about every other three-row SUV on the market. What may seem like a small oversight made it impossible for me to sit comfortably in the driver’s seat. At 6-feet tall and with a slender build, I had to move the seat back pretty far to get a comfortable distance from the steering wheel. In that driving position, my elbows couldn’t reach the armrest. Combine this with the Tribeca’s high seating position, and I was not a happy commuter during my 90-minute drives to and from Cars.com’s offices.\n\nFit, of course, will vary from person to person. Some people may not have any issues, but I was not the only editor to experience frustration over the steering wheel. And the front seating problem snowballed into issues for the second and third rows, too, partly because of the Tribeca’s small size. Legroom is already mediocre in the second row, at 34.3 inches, but with the driver’s seat where I had it positioned, the second row lost heaps of that space. Then, with the second row slid all the way back to compensate, the third row was left with literally no legroom.\n\nVery few crossovers have enough room in their third row to make adults feel comfortable, and the Tribeca isn’t close to breaking that mold. The seat is so close to the floor that my legs and thighs were positioned uncomfortably off the seat cushion.\n\nCargo\nWe test a standard assortment of grocery bags, golf clubs and luggage in every car we drive, and there wasn’t much — or any, really — room to spare behind the Tribeca’s third row; there’s only 8.3 cubic feet of storage back there. That’s significantly less than the Pilot’s 18 cubic feet, and it’s even less than a small sedan’s trunk.\n\nWith both rows folded flat, the Tribeca has 74.4 cubic feet of total cargo space. Again, it’s an unexceptional amount considering the Pilot has 87 cubic feet, the Highlander has 95.4 and the CX-9 boasts 100.7. What’s more, I can’t imagine trying to fit seven people in this car, especially seven people I like. What’s truly revealing is that Subaru’s Outback wagon doesn’t require a huge concession in overall cargo space (it offers 71.3 cubic feet) even though it seats just five.\n\nFeatures\nOne of the Tribeca’s redeeming qualities is Subaru’s trademark Symmetrical all-wheel drive. It’s one of the best systems available for tackling the slippery snow- and rain-covered city roads on which I drove the Tribeca. Even in aggressive starts in these conditions, the car accelerated seamlessly from stoplights. The Tribeca’s all-wheel drive distributes power to all four wheels all the time, helping with a smooth delivery of traction.\n\nNow here comes Debbie Downer: Unlike the Forester and Outback, the Tribeca’s all-wheel drive doesn’t come at much of a discount compared with the competition. The Pilot, Highlander and CX-9 come really close to or beat the Tribeca’s starting price when equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nOur fully loaded Touring came in at an as-tested price of $37,995. The only option missing was a rear DVD entertainment system. The Touring trim level comes with xenon headlights, a power moonroof, a backup camera and Bluetooth for its $35,795 starting price. Our tester had the optional touch-screen navigation system for another $2,200.\n\nThe navigation system suffered from a fundamental flaw: The touch-screen is beyond arm’s reach — or at least it was beyond mine. To enter an address or check the gas mileage, I had to lean very far forward to reach the screen at the top of the dashboard. The navigation itself felt outdated, with graphics that are easily bested by many of today’s smartphones and portable GPS devices.\n\nAcceleration, Ride & Handling\nOne engine is available in the Tribeca, and it’s a solid one. The 3.6-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder makes 256 horsepower and offers punchy acceleration around town. Even the lightest tap of the throttle results in quick acceleration. The engine does, however, seem to lose some of its gusto at highway speeds when trying to pass.\n\nWith only one engine, transmission (a five-speed automatic) and driveline configuration, the Tribeca’s gas mileage is a somewhat unimpressive 16/21 mpg city/highway — take it or leave it. Other crossovers have the option of more efficient front-wheel-drive models, and the Highlander has a base four-cylinder engine for the gas-conscious.\n\nOne of the Tribeca’s strongest driving attributes is its ride quality; the suspension absorbs road imperfections with ease, making for a very comfortable commute.\n\nSafety\nLike the rest of Subaru’s current lineup, the 2011 Tribeca is a Top Safety Pick at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores the agency’s best rating, Good, in front-, rear- and side-impact crash tests, as well as in a roof-strength test.\n\nAs of publication, the 2011 Tribeca has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using its revised testing procedures.\n\nTribeca in the Market\nIn April, new-car sales of the Tribeca totaled a lackluster 241 units. Sales numbers aren’t always an indication of a good or bad product, but in this case, it seems seven-seat crossover shoppers are buying elsewhere.\n\nThe Honda Pilot sells around 8,000 a month, and even the more niche, sporty Mazda CX-9 crossover sells around 2,800 units. To be competitive, Subaru needs to give the Tribeca some serious attention. Given its smaller size, its entry-level price doesn’t give it much of an advantage over the competition, and there are also some very good products competing from within Subaru — including the Outback, which sold 9,400 units in April.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Subaru is on a roll, with recent redesigns of the Forester, Outback and Legacy earning recognition from Cars.com editors and consumers alike for their value and how competitive they are within their segments. Another all-new Subaru — the 36-mpg 2012 Impreza — will debut this summer, leaving one Subaru that seems to have been forgotten: the seven-seat Tribeca crossover SUV.\n\nThe 2011 Subaru Tribeca shines when it comes to ride quality and safety ratings, but its smaller size and outdated interior hold it back compared with three-row crossover rivals.\n\nIn fact, the Tribeca doesn’t seem to be quite the value other Subarus are. Tribecas come in base Premium, midlevel Limited and loaded Touring trim levels. I drove a Touring. All come standard with a six-cylinder engine, automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nInside\nThe interior’s design has aged well over the years, with a smooth, curvy flow that wraps around front passengers. That’s quite the feat considering it’s essentially the same design used when this car was introduced as the B9 Tribeca for 2006.\n\nHowever, the quality of the materials in there is far from the segment’s best. There’s an overuse of silver plastic that’s meant to imitate aluminum — a cheap-looking trick. The dashboard and center console are carved out of the stuff, and they don’t do the unique design any justice.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the interior, though, is the lack of a telescoping steering wheel, which is found in just about every other three-row SUV on the market. What may seem like a small oversight made it impossible for me to sit comfortably in the driver’s seat. At 6-feet tall and with a slender build, I had to move the seat back pretty far to get a comfortable distance from the steering wheel. In that driving position, my elbows couldn’t reach the armrest. Combine this with the Tribeca’s high seating position, and I was not a happy commuter during my 90-minute drives to and from Cars.com’s offices.\n\nFit, of course, will vary from person to person. Some people may not have any issues, but I was not the only editor to experience frustration over the steering wheel. And the front seating problem snowballed into issues for the second and third rows, too, partly because of the Tribeca’s small size. Legroom is already mediocre in the second row, at 34.3 inches, but with the driver’s seat where I had it positioned, the second row lost heaps of that space. Then, with the second row slid all the way back to compensate, the third row was left with literally no legroom.\n\nVery few crossovers have enough room in their third row to make adults feel comfortable, and the Tribeca isn’t close to breaking that mold. The seat is so close to the floor that my legs and thighs were positioned uncomfortably off the seat cushion.\n\nCargo\nWe test a standard assortment of grocery bags, golf clubs and luggage in every car we drive, and there wasn’t much — or any, really — room to spare behind the Tribeca’s third row; there’s only 8.3 cubic feet of storage back there. That’s significantly less than the Pilot’s 18 cubic feet, and it’s even less than a small sedan’s trunk.\n\nWith both rows folded flat, the Tribeca has 74.4 cubic feet of total cargo space. Again, it’s an unexceptional amount considering the Pilot has 87 cubic feet, the Highlander has 95.4 and the CX-9 boasts 100.7. What’s more, I can’t imagine trying to fit seven people in this car, especially seven people I like. What’s truly revealing is that Subaru’s Outback wagon doesn’t require a huge concession in overall cargo space (it offers 71.3 cubic feet) even though it seats just five.\n\nFeatures\nOne of the Tribeca’s redeeming qualities is Subaru’s trademark symmetrical all-wheel drive. It’s one of the best systems available for tackling the slippery snow- and rain-covered city roads on which I drove the Tribeca. Even in aggressive starts in these conditions, the car accelerated seamlessly from stoplights. The Tribeca’s all-wheel drive distributes power to all four wheels all the time, helping with a smooth delivery of traction.\n\nNow here comes Debbie Downer: Unlike the Forester and Outback, the Tribeca’s all-wheel drive doesn’t come at much of a discount compared with the competition. The Pilot, Highlander and CX-9 come really close to or beat the Tribeca’s starting price when equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nOur fully loaded Touring came in at an as-tested price of $37,995. The only option missing was a rear DVD entertainment system. The Touring trim level comes with xenon headlights, a power moonroof, a backup camera and Bluetooth for its $35,795 starting price. Our tester had the optional touch-screen navigation system for another $2,200.\n\nThe navigation system suffered from a fundamental flaw: The touch-screen is beyond arm’s reach — or at least it was beyond mine. To enter an address or check the gas mileage, I had to lean very far forward to reach the screen at the top of the dashboard. The navigation itself felt outdated, with graphics that are easily bested by many of today’s smartphones and portable GPS devices.\n\nAcceleration, Ride & Handling\nOne engine is available in the Tribeca, and it’s a solid one. The 3.6-liter, horizontally opposed six-cylinder makes 256 horsepower and offers punchy acceleration around town. Even the lightest tap of the throttle results in quick acceleration. The engine does, however, seem to lose some of its gusto at highway speeds when trying to pass.\n\nWith only one engine, transmission (a five-speed automatic) and driveline configuration, the Tribeca’s gas mileage is a somewhat unimpressive 16/21 mpg city/highway — take it or leave it. Other crossovers have the option of more efficient front-wheel-drive models, and the Highlander has a base four-cylinder engine for the gas-conscious.\n\nOne of the Tribeca’s strongest driving attributes is its ride quality; the suspension absorbs road imperfections with ease, making for a very comfortable commute.\n\nSafety\nLike the rest of Subaru’s current lineup, the 2011 Tribeca is a Top Safety Pick at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores the agency’s best rating, Good, in front-, rear- and side-impact crash tests, as well as in a roof-strength test.\n\nAs of publication, the 2011 Tribeca has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using its revised testing procedures.\n\nTribeca in the Market\nIn April, new-car sales of the Tribeca totaled a lackluster 241 units. Sales numbers aren’t always an indication of a good or bad product, but in this case, it seems seven-seat crossover shoppers are buying elsewhere.\n\nThe Honda Pilot sells around 8,000 a month, and even the more niche, sporty Mazda CX-9 crossover sells around 2,800 units. To be competitive, Subaru needs to give the Tribeca some serious attention. Given its smaller size, its entry-level price doesn’t give it much of an advantage over the competition, and there are also some very good products competing from within Subaru — including the Outback, which sold 9,400 units in April.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicles take years to create.\n\nUnlike newspapers, which can create a new front page in the time it takes to reset a ripped paper roll, cars and trucks don’t magically transform themselves during the same edition.\n\nThat might explain why Subaru, one of hottest carmakers in America, and one of the few to show an increase in sales last year, recently launched the 2010 Subaru Tribeca Touring. Back when this vehicle was under development, gas prices had yet to spike to $100 a gallon and the economy had yet to bottom out. At least I hope that’s the case.\n\nIn 2007, when the Tribeca received its massive makeover, someone must have come up with the idea of a top-of-the-line Touring model.\n\nIntroducing an SUV with a combined mileage under 20 and a starting price tag over $36,000 must have seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nHow times have changed. The Tribeca Touring was outdated even before it arrived. The big body, once considered spacious, is now cumbersome. The multi-terrain capable all-wheel drive is just rough. The inconspicuous styling is just boring, but that was true before.\n\nIt looks like any other run-of-the-mill SUV, and big and bulky have already fallen out of favor with consumers. After the superb Legacy, Outback and ever-capable Forester, Subaru was due for a dud.\n\nThe Tribeca Touring may have a gutsy little engine, and it is still fun to drive, but it’s as exciting as a bag of rock salt in the summer. It has a purpose; it’s just the wrong time. Bulky, but powerful\n\nBut first, the good news: The 3.6-liter Boxer engine is very responsive. The 256-horsepower engine creates 247 pound-feet of torque to help this heavy SUV (it weighs 4,256 pounds) merge on highways easily and tear down any city street. The all-wheel drive system also helps keep this lug rolling.\n\nThe all-wheel drive system remains one of the best around and explains why every Subaru sold comes with it. The Tribeca splits its power 45 to 55 percent with a rear axle bias, which adds to the sporty feel when you’re on the road. Add to that an independent suspension, and the Tribeca, despite feeling more like a true highway cruiser, can handle itself off-road, as well.\n\nNow some bad news: The ride remains harsh and noisy no matter what surface you’re driving on.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission, which is smooth and responsive to aggressive or mild driving, remains one gear short of a modern vehicle.\n\nThe exterior looks outdated, and it’s only 3 years old. The 2007 Tribeca may have been homely — what with the triple grille fascia and sharp headlights cutting into the hood — but at least it had some character. Now, the Touring adopts the much more staid and flat front end with a single grille stretched across its face and rectangle headlights. Before it was the Lady Gaga, now it’s the Grey Lady.\n\nThe sides of the Tribeca add lots of sheet metal and a rising belt line that was stylish a few years ago but now seems garish. Really, there’s nothing that stands out with the Tribeca’s dated exterior. Its proportions focus on the pudgy midsection. Its roof line recedes the farther back it goes. It could be a middle aged man if it didn’t rest on 18-inch wheels.\n\nIf the design needed a headline it would be simple: Zzzzzzzzzzzz. Lots of room, features\n\nDespite my displeasure with the vehicle’s exterior, I found the interior quite accommodating. Of course, this typically happens with top-of-the-line, fully loaded vehicles. As the top-end Tribeca, the Touring comes as loaded as an overworked office at an open bar Christmas party.\n\nThe twin cockpit design flows nicely in easy moving curves traced in aluminum trim. The two-tone color adds depth and a sophisticated look. The front leather seats are comfortable and come with two memory positions that keep different drivers happy. The seats offer lots of space, and heat comes standard — a feature that every vehicle should include in Michigan.\n\nOther standard features include: dual climate controls, an auxiliary air conditioning system for the second and third rows, 385-watt harman/kardon stereo, XM satellite radio and Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity. There’s also an auto-dimming rear view mirror that shields your eyes to bright lights behind you and has become a favored feature I always forget to notice until I don’t have it.\n\nThe deep-set optional navigation system is easy to use, though the touch screen feels a little out of reach for most people. If you’re the type of person who programs the navigation system before leaving the driveway, this system works great. If you’re the type who tries to program it at stop lights, it’s a little more difficult. Included in the system is a back-up camera and optional reverse assist sensors that beep faster as you approach an object.\n\nIf you need a second-row entertainment system, Subaru offers a 9-inch wide LCD screen and DVD player for movies. There are also inputs for a video game system or a video camera — allowing kids the chance to see home movies before they even get home.\n\nWhile the second row is roomy, the third row looks pointless. If you put a dog back there, you might end up on “Animal Cops” facing cruelty charges. On paper, it reads well: 30.9 inches of legroom, 43.3 inches of hip room and 36.2 inches of head room. But climbing into the third row is difficult. In reality, you can squeeze a gym in there, but it would be difficult to reach. I’d suggest removing the third row to take advantage of the space. If the third row is folded down, the Tribeca Touring has 37.6 cubic feet of cargo room; if the third row is up, there’s only 8.3 cubic feet.\n\nBut that suggestion only comes if I were to recommend the Tribeca Touring, which I can’t.\n\nThe Tribeca Touring may be capable, but it’s also overpriced in comparison to other seven-passenger vehicles. With a starting price tag at over $36,000, there are a lot more vehicles you can get for a lot less. And if you consider a crossover, such as the Chevy Traverse, you’ll find more space, more flexibility and a more stylish vehicle.\n\nEvery vehicle has its time. And despite Subaru’s success, the time for the Tribeca Touring should have never arrived.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ** 1/2\n\nExterior: Fair. Boring at best and dull at worst. The Tribeca Touring looks dated.\n\nInterior: Good. Comfortable and lots of standard features. The first and second rows offer lots of space; the third row would be considered inhumane for pets.\n\nPerformance: Good. Plenty of power and the all-wheel drive system remains one of the best around, but the poor gas mileage hurts overall standing.\n\nPros: Great for people who really want a truck but want some of the environmental cred Subaru offers.\n\nCons: Dated looks, poor gas mileage and high price make it the last on a long list of much more competitive seven-passenger people haulers.\n\nGrading Scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor\n\n2010 Subaru Tribeca Touring\n\nType: Seven-passenger, all-wheel drive SUV\n\nPrice: $36,490\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter Boxer Six, six-cylinder horizontally opposed, aluminum block and heads\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic with manual mode\n\nPower: 256 horsepower, 247 pound-feet torque\n\nEPA gas mileage: 16 mpg city / 21 mpg highway",

      "expert_review": "I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning: It’s cold out, and I had to put on socks for the first time in four months – a huge bummer because I painted my toenails Vixen Red last night and now I can’t enjoy them. On top of that, my morning newspaper was mysteriously missing, mucking up my usual routine of attempting to catch up on current events. I do this so I can pretend to participate in real live adult conversation, assuming I run into any real live adults who want to discuss something other than the upcoming preschool pumpkin festival. Moving on to break my fast with O.J. and Peanut Butter Puffins, I discovered that the Puffins had all been eaten (well, all but a lonely five of them), and the nearly empty box had been returned neatly to the shelf. Because I promised myself I wouldn’t do anything else until I got this review wrapped up this morning, though, I’m going to have to push through – no morning paper, no Puffins and all grumpified and such. That’s your official disclaimer before reading further.\n\nDespite having a pro list that’s an entire page long and only three cons for the 2008 Subaru Tribeca, this crossover still leaves me feeling underwhelmed and uninspired. It’s been updated since last year, and the car’s “schnoz” (as it was referred to when we reviewed it before) has been given a little nip-tuck so it looks much less schnoz-like. Rear visibility has been improved, as has access to the third row. Now you can get back there from either side of the car instead of just one. This was a complaint of ours in the past, but honestly, no matter how easy it is to slide the second row forward, kids will prefer to muck up the seats with their muddy shoes by climbing over the top of them any day – which is why you should always get leather seats that wipe clean.\n\nAlso as part of its “redesign,” the Tribeca’s name has been streamlined from B9 Tribeca to simply Tribeca. Semantics, I say. If they really wanted to improve this crossover, why didn’t they give us some Latch connectors that are actually useable? The two sets of connectors in the second row’s outboard seating positions are practically inaccessible. They’re wedged deep within the seat bight, and the leather seats are too stiff for you to maneuver your fingers around to position the hooks properly. Also, despite having standard side curtain airbags, they only extend to protect passengers in the first and second rows. Many other three-row crossovers have a curtain airbag available back there, but not all do. Apparently, before you purchase a Tribeca you’ll need to have a serious conversation with your kids’ other parent to decide which of your children are most expendable – they can sit in the third row. In the Tribeca’s defense, Subaru spokesman Dominick Infante said there’s enough superstructure in the third row that the side curtain airbag isn’t needed there.\n\nOK, despite my grumpy complaints, there are several nice things that I did appreciate in the Tribeca. Let’s start with the nighttime ambient lighting scheme whose color is shockingly similar to my Vixen Red toenails. I’m really not superficial enough to match my car to my nail enamel, but seeing this baby lit up at night is a sight to behold. I also appreciated the dual power outlets and auxiliary jack in the center console, along with the little notch for the power cords to slide through so they don’t get pinched.\n\nThere’s plenty of functional storage in the Tribeca, including two cupholders with corresponding junk holders next to them for the driver and passenger to organize loose accoutrements. There are in-door storage bins with cupholders, and two more cupholders in the center armrest for second-row passengers. A hidden slide-out storage bin near the bottom of the center console is a great place for second-row passengers to store stuff, as well. I also liked the 50/50-split folding rear seats, and I loved the smooth feel of this car while driving and the reliable all-wheel drive for which Subaru is known.\n\nIn a day when manufacturers are tricking out new cars with entertainment systems with live television, doors that open almost magically, lights and windshield wipers that turn on without human prompting, and seats that swivel, disappear, reconfigure and fold electronically, the once-futuristic cockpit design of the Tribeca is getting old fast. Subaru better start thinking a bit further into the future before it gets left in the dust.\n\nOK, off to the store to buy some Puffins.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Subaru Tribeca and its safety features, visit Cars.com.
