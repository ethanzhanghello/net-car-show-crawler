      "expert_review": "Automakers usually like to fill the media test fleet with their best finery, but occasionally an automaker will dare deliver a unit equipped as consumers purchase them, which means affordably. Such was the case with the 1995 Ford Windstar GL.\n\nNo power door-locks, no power windows, no leather seats, no . . . you get the picture. The GL is the value leader, a bare-bones version with few frills,but a window sticker that won’t take your breath away either, though it may make your heart skip to an unfamiliar beat for a few seconds.\n\nThe GL is not stripped. It comes with dual air bags and anti-lock brakes asstandard, two of the vital systems everyone wants regardless of whether they can afford to write out one check that day or one check each month for the next four or five years.\n\nOur test vehicle also came with the 3.8-liter, 155-h.p., V-6 engine teamed with 4-speed automatic. Hardly a crude combo. Ample power and quiet operation.The drawback is that the fuel economy rating is only 17 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway and that seemed generous based on our real-world extended trip. However, we filled with enthanol, the 10 percent alcohol-based stuff that may clean the air but also does a rather thorough job of cleaning out your wallet at the pump.\n\nFord, in the next few days, will have an alternative engine available, a 3-liter, 147-h.p., V-6 rated at 18 city/25 highway for those who want to put alittle more time and miles between fills. It will become the standard engine; the 3.8, V-6 optional.\n\nRide and handling were rather pleasant, though it’s best to ease off the accelerator when approaching one of those wide-swing entrance/exit ramps on the interstate to reduce body sway and lean. The long 120.7-inch wheelbase helps smooth out road harshness in the cabin.\n\nThe GL test vehicle offered no compact disc player but there was an AM/FM stereo with digital clock; no leather, but comfortable cloth that keeps coolerin the summer; no automatic self-dimming rearview mirror, but two large outside mirrors for good side and rear visibility. The interior may have been spartan, but it was roomy and comfortable and able to seat the entire family, their luggage and the dog. And there were dual cupholders.\n\nThe GL starts at $19,590, considerably less than the $23,760 base price forthe next-lowest-priced Windstar, the LX.\n\nThe options added were the preferred equipment group at $915, which included air conditioning, a seven-inch track for the rear seat to travel on so it could be pushed forward to store more luggage without removing the seat and floor mats.\n\nStandard equipment includes tinted glass, underbody spare tire carrier, rear window wiper/washer, stowage compartment in the rear side panel, body-colored bumpers, seven-passenger seating, gas-pressurized shocks, power steering and 15-inch tires.",

      "expert_review": "To really test a minivan, you need to load it with people and possessions and drive it somewhere. That’s just what we did with the 1996 Ford Windstar LX. Grabbed the kids, the grandparents and eight pieces of overstuffed luggage and took a long hike from Atlanta to the South Carolina coast. (OK, so we needed a vacation, too.)\n\nThe key questions: How did the Windstar’s revised 3.8-liter engine perform and how aggravating was the lack of a fourth door – something that competitors like Honda and Chrysler have over Ford?\n\nHe: After the first hour in a Windstar crammed full of people and suitcases, I remembered just why I swore off taking family vacations in minivans some 10 years ago. After the second hour, most of which was spent dashing on and off the freeway and merging with all those monster rigs, I began to really appreciate the lustier 200 horsepower engine in the ’96 Windstar LX, which is up nearly 30 percent from last year. It’s also reassuring to have standard antilock brakes and, if you want extra peace of mind, optional traction control.\n\nShe: Well, at least you weren’t shoehorned into the third seat like I was with my mother. I know we got stuck there because we were the shortest of the six. Great point about the Windstar: That third seat can fold or slide forward to accommodate luggage. The down side: When you’ve got a lot of luggage, you’re not left with a lot of legroom in that third seat, especially if you’re adult-sized. My mother was in a better position because she was on the end and could stretch out her legs, but I did a yoga-style sit for five hours. Ouch!\n\nHe: In all fairness, I can’t imagine too many families who would perform the kind of acid test we did very often in their personal vehicles. And I don’t mean sticking my mother-in-law in the third seat. The extra complement of people and bags gave us a pretty good chance to see how the new engine performs under a full load. What was even more remarkable was our fuel economy – well over 20 miles per gallon averaged over 500 miles.\n\nShe: When you finally gave me the wheel I enjoyed how easy the Windstar was to drive and park. It’s slightly bulky in appearance, but don’t be fooled. I wedged it into the tiniest spaces in shopping malls with no problem.\n\nHe: You never seem to have a problem in shopping malls.\n\nShe: How would you even know that? You usually take a nap while I shop. And speaking of snoozing, that brings me to another important point about our experience in the Windstar. I was struck by how much sleeping we all did in those passenger seats. That is a testimonial to the minivan’s smooth ride. The gas-pressurized shocks at all four corners really iron out the bumps.\n\nHe: You always have to throw in a metaphor involving housework, don’t you? That reference to ironing makes me nervous.\n\nShe: Just because you’re ironing impaired.\n\nHe: I can’t help but think the Windstar’s biggest remaining drawback is the lack of a fourth door – which now seems to be an incredible oversight on Ford’s part. I hear they’re trying to stretch the driver’s door on next year’s model so you can squeeze into the rear, but I don’t really expect Ford to offer a genuine four-door version of the Windstar much before 1999. That seems kind of dumb, considering nearly everybody else on the planet will probably have one by then.\n\nShe: Some younger families don’t like that optional fourth door. What I don’t like is that you don’t get much of a price break over the Windstar’s four-door competitors like the Honda Odyssey and the Chrysler models.\n\nHe: I probably wouldn’t squawk so much about the $27,000 sticker if it included that fourth door, considering all the features you get with the Windstar LX. But you can get a very nicely equipped Odyssey EX four-door for about the same money.\n\nShe: Yeah, but you can’t get a six-cylinder engine in the Honda nor could you fit all six of us and our luggage in the Odys What I did admire about the Windstar is the fact that it gives you a very friendly family environment, almost reminiscent of a bigger house. We hauled volatile cargo – teen-agers, parents and grandparents, including a grandpa with a bad knee – and not one fight occurred. I chalk that up to little amenities like cupholders at each seat and an optional headphone jack and climate controls for rear passengers. I also like the fact that the floor of the Windstar was low, and that made for easy loading of both passengers and stuff.\n\nHe: With the new engine and the available traction control, the ’96 Windstar is above average, but not cutting edge. When the Windstar came out two years ago, it looked pretty fresh, but it’s already beginning to age. Since then, Honda has come into the market and the Chryslers have been totally redesigned. And the competition is only going to get stiffer, what with the new GM minivans getting ready to hit the showrooms in September.\n\nShe: For many families, the Windstar is going to seem sensible, not sensational. If you’re a ‘Ford family,’ you’re going to do just fine in it. If you’ve got a larger family, crave the fourth door and need the extra room, the extended-length Chrysler minivans may be a better choice. I had a great vacation, but if I had to do it again, I’d probably look into driving the Plymouth or the Dodge – or leave the kids home.\n\n1996 Ford Windstar LX\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, seven-passenger minivan.\n\nPrice: Base, $24,465; as tested, $27,005 (inc. $555 destination charge, less $560 package discount and $485 delete option credit).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: 3.0 liter V-6 now standard on base GL model, 3.8 liter V-6 now rated at 200 horsepower, traction control added as option, new child safety seat option in second row, convertible rear seat that folds into bed.\n\nStandard equipment: Cruise control, tilt steering column, alloy wheels, AM-FM stereo cassette, intermittent wipers, power locks, lighted visor vanity mirrors, power windows.\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, antilock brakes, child restraint seat (optional), traction control (optional), child-proof rear-door lock.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Preferred equipment package 477A, inc. floor mats, rear defroster, luggage rack, tinted glass, remote keyless entry and two-tone paint ($1,860); heated power mirrors ($340); floor console ($140); high-capacity air conditioning ($465); child-restraint seat ($225).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6; 200-hp at 5000 rpm; 230 lb-ft torque at 3000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nCompetitors: Plymouth Grand Voyager, Dodge Grand Caravan, Honda Odyssey, Mercury Villager, Nissan Quest, Chevrolet Lumina Van, Pontiac TransSport, Mazda MPV.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 120.7 inches; overall length, 201.2 inches; curb weight, 3,700 pounds (est.); legroom, 41.8 inches front/39.2 inches mi ddle/35.3 inches rear; headroom, 39.3 inches front/38.9 inches middle/38.1 inches rear; shoulder room, 60.9 inches front/62.9 inches middle/57.6 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost: $1,119 *\n\nWhere built: Oakville, Ont.\n\n* AAA Michigan rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "If Ford Motor Co. had it to do over again, the Windstar mini-van would havehad more doors than cupholders.\n\nBut, the automaker insists, when it surveyed consumers about their wantsand needs in the early development years of its rival to Chrysler and GeneralMotors mini-vans, most folks said they saw no need for a slide-open door onboth sides of the van.\n\nSo Ford left one off the driver’s side.\n\nBetter Ford leave off a wheel or seat or window, because Chrysler, theindustry’s mini van-sales leader, and GM, one of the followers, added aslide-open door on the driver’s side of its vans.\n\nGM went Chrysler one better and offered the option of a power-operateddriver-side slider.\n\nSo Ford goofed and won’t add the door until 1999.\n\nWe tested the 1998 version with its stop-gap feature aimed at atoning for alack of a driver-side slider–the King Door.\n\nThe driver-side door is bigger than usual to allow the rugrats to scootinto the back seat through the driver’s door.\n\nFirst, however, the driver must get out, which he or she doesn’t have to dowith the Chrysler and GM sliders, since most kids can open the door on theirown–and those that can’t are aided with a power door at GM.\n\nThe Windstar’s driver’s seat also slides farther forward than usual toallow easier access to the back seat.\n\nWhile Ford goofed on doors, it came up with a really nice feature itsrivals failed to think of, a mirror in the center of the roof above the dash that allows driver orpassenger to check out the kids in back without having to loosen their belts,slip sideways in the seat and gawk over the headrest.\n\nThe Windstar has lots of goodies, such as a stowage bin in the left rearwall to serve back-seat passengers, a couple of power plugs for addedaccessories, cup/juice-box holders, a coin holder in the roof (out of the way, but an in-dash or in-console unit would require less time taking your eyes offthe roadto come up with the correct change) and a lock button in the rearcargo area, which we would love to know what it locked or unlocked.\n\nSafety hardware includes dual air bags, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes, butnot traction control and not four-wheel or all-wheel-drive.\n\nBase price of the Windstar GL we drove is $20,655. Sprucing it up with the”preferred equipment package” added $4,405 for such things as speed control,tilt steering, rear-window defroster, AM/FM stereo with cassette and clock,luggage rack, power windows/ locks/mirrors. Floor mats ran $90 and remoteentry $175. With $580 in freight, the sticker ran almost $26,000.\n\nAs is so common with Ford, you then are awarded a discount on thehigh-content option package, in this case $1,300 to bring the package down to$3,105 and the final price to $24,575.\n\nYou spend $3,105 to save $1,300. Why not just lower the sticker to beginwith?",

      "expert_review": "Sparks, that little voice that resides somewhere between my heart and my brain, wouldn’t shut up.\n\n“How could you?” she asked. “How could you possibly rank DaimlerChrysler’s Town & Country minivan number one?”\n\nThe question arose during a long run in Ford Motor Co.’s 1999 Windstar LX minivan. A year ago, the answer would’ve been simple. “That’s easy,” I would’ve said then. “The Town & Country has everything the Windstar doesn’t — performance, comfort, utility, looks.”\n\nBut that was then. Today, maneuvering through New York City’s murderous traffic, it was a different story. The new Windstar seemed especially well equipped for that contest — more so, in fact, than the Town & Country.\n\nThe Windstar was nimble, which is no small thing for a minivan. Many minivans, because of their high walls and long bodies, seem to move in sections, especially in sharp turns. It’s as if their front sections turn first and the rear portions sort of follow — like driving an articulated bus that has never quite learned the language of the road.\n\nAnyway, there was none of that shimmy-shammy stuff with the Windstar. It was tight! It ran with the best of New York’s cabs, and usually came out ahead. I was impressed. But there was more to come.\n\nTranquilizers should be included as standard equipment for parking on the streets of New York City, and the dose should be tripled for trying to park something as large as a minivan.\n\nFirst, you have to find a space. Then you have to pray that the driver in your rearview mirror allows you to back into that space. And when you’re backing in, you have to be certain you aren’t bumping someone else’s car, which is where the new Windstar’s optional Reverse Sensing System (RSS) comes in.\n\nRSS uses sonar to deliver proximity warnings, in the form of beeps, when an object is within 5.9 feet of the Windstar’s rear bumper. The beeps increase in frequency as the Windstar moves closer to the object, and they become a steady, high-pitched whistle when the object is within 10 inches of the minivan’s rear bumper.\n\nIf RSS saves you once in this city, it could be the save of a lifetime.\n\nThere are numerous other features, such as optional, seat-mounted side-impact air bags for front-seat occupants. And Ford has cleverly designed the mounts for the Windstar’s middle bench seat to allow it to be moved to the left or right side of the vehicle.\n\nAlso, the Windstar now comes with sliding doors on both sides — something the Town & Country and other minivans offered earlier. Ford adds the optional spiff of power sliding doors on both sides, which can be opened and closed with an electronic key fob.\n\nOn top of all this good stuff is an exceptionally smooth 3.8-liter V-6 designed to produce 200 horsepower at 5,000 rpm and 180 pound-feet of torque at 3,250 rpm. The engine is mated to a standard, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nHow can I rate DaimlerChrysler’s Town & Country number one? I can’t, Sparks, not after driving the new Windstar. Advantage, Ford.\n\n1999 Ford Windstar LX\n\nComplaints: Okay, so Ford has snatched DaimlerChrysler’s idea of putting rollers on its middle and rear seats for easy removal. But taking them out still ain’t easy. Those seats are heavy as heck. And to make matters worse, there is no convenient way to grip ’em and lug ’em, not even with two people doing the heavy lifting.\n\nIf DaimlerChrysler wants to take Warren’s No. 1 Minivan ranking back from Ford, it has to come up with middle and rear seats that are light enough to be removed by one person, yet strong enough to seat five people comfortably and safely. If Ford wants to keep that ranking, it ought to beat DaimlerChrysler to the punch.\n\nPraise: Don’t just take my word for it. Drive the 1999 Windstar against any minivan out there, and that includes Honda’s bigger, new Odyssey and Toyota’s Sienna. I think you’ll agree, in this case, that it’s more than a sl ogan: Ford has a better idea .\n\nHead-turning quotient: DaimlerChrysler still makes the prettiest minivans on the market. If this were just a beauty contest, the Town & Country and its minivan siblings would win hands down.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Easily among the best in class in all three categories. I couldn’t believe how well the new Windstar handled, both loaded and unloaded, in some pretty dicey driving situations. Bravo! Also, excellent braking both loaded and unloaded. Brakes include power front discs/rear drums with antilock.\n\nCapacities: Seats seven in tested, four-door wagon configuration. Cargo volume is 148.5 cubic feet. Holds 26 gallons of regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nProduct mix: Windstars are available as two-door vans or three- or four-door wagons. There is a base 147-horsepower, 3-liter V-6 engine. Trim levels include L, LX, SE and SEL models, with the SEL version being the most expensive.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker AM-FM stereo radio and cassette with single-disc in-dash CD player. Okay.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Windstar LX is $23,660. Price as tested is $26,425, including $2,185 in options and a $580 destination charge. Dealer invoice on base model is $21,361.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with any minivan available in the U.S. market. Windstar prices start at $18,375. Control pricing by controlling lust for options.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPower-adjustable pedals and a rear-seat video entertainment system are new options on Ford’s front-wheel-drive minivan. With the power pedals, the accelerator and brake pedals adjust within a four-inch range to help drivers attain a more comfortable position. Ford also offers this feature on some of its cars and sport utility vehicles.\n\nThe rear-seat entertainment system includes a 6.4-inch liquid-crystal display screen that flips up from the center console for viewing by middle and rear-seat passengers. A VCR and jacks for video games also are mounted in the console.\n\nExterior\nWindstar comes in one size: 201 inches long with a 121-inch wheelbase, which is a couple inches longer than a Dodge Grand Caravan. Windstar offers the choice of a single sliding door on the passenger side or the more popular configuration of sliding doors on both sides.\n\nA power open-close feature for both sliding doors is standard on the SEL model and optional on the SE model. A power feature for just the passenger-side door is optional on LX and SE models. A rear liftgate is standard on all models.\n\nInterior\nAll passenger models seat seven, and the base and LX models have two front buckets, a two-place middle bench and a three-place rear bench. Two bucket seats replace the middle bench as standard on the SE and SEL models and as an option on the LX. The middle and rear seats are removable, and the three-place bench has built-in rollers and can be mounted in the middle row. Shopping-bag hooks are a new feature on the back of the three-place bench.\n\nA cargo model comes with two front buckets, carpeting and a cloth headliner in the front compartment.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEngine choices are a 3.0-liter V-6 with 150 horsepower or a 3.8-liter V-6 with 200 horsepower, both with four-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0-liter engine is standard on the cargo van and base passenger model. The 3.8-liter V-6 is standard on the LX, SE and SEL passenger models and optional on the cargo van.\n\nTraction control is standard on the Limited model and optional on the LX, SE and SEL models.\n\nSafety\nWindstar is the first minivan to receive the federal governments highest ratings for both front and side crash tests (the Honda Odyssey recently became the second). Side-impact airbags for the front seats are optional on all models, and antilock brakes are standard on all. The sonar-based Reverse Sensing System, which sounds a warning when the Windstar comes within six feet of an object when backing up, is optional on the LX, SE and SEL models.\n\nPerformance\nWindstar doesnt set the pace among minivans in most areas, but it is at the head of the pack in safety ratings, which should be a strong recommendation for a family vehicle.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Minivans make sense. They did back in 1984 when Chrysler built the first one, and they still do today.\n\nThe trouble is, a lot of 30-year-olds gravitate to SUVs instead of minivans when vans would do a better job of carrying around their budding families. Maybe that’s because they grew up being chauffeured around in them, or maybe it’s because they think of minivans as old folks vehicles, like station wagons were to us when we were kids.\n\nSuffice it to say, minivans today are better than ever. Instead of driving like wobbly boxes, they are buttoned down, solid and as nicely equipped as any family sedan. Many, like the Windstar driven here, even come with a built-in video player and a flip-down screen that will keep kids occupied when mom and dad insist on taking the kind of driving vacations lavished upon them by their parents.\n\nFor 2001, Ford has updated the Windstar with a chrome grille and 16-inch wheels, and the 200-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine is now standard on all models. Ford says the Windstar is classified as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV). Another key piece of standard equipment is the Personal Safety System that uses sensors to determine the severity of a crash, the position of the front seat and whether seat belts are in use. Two-stage front airbags then deploy according to crash severity and whether the passenger seat is occupied. Retractors tighten the seat belts to help control an occupantÕs forward motion. A low-tire-pressure warning system also alerts the driver if a tire needs air.\n\nIn recent crash tests by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the Windstar received a five-star rating for front and rear passengers in a side impact. In 1999, it received five stars for frontal impacts. Results for 2001 are not yet available, but there is no reason to think they would be any lower.\n\nLater in the year, Ford’s AdvanceTrac vehicle stability system will be available. AdvanceTrac uses the anti-lock brakes and traction control systems to help counteract skidding in emergency evasive maneuvers. Our test vehicle was also equipped with the power-operated adjustable pedals so short drivers donÕt have to sit dangerously close to the steering wheel.\n\nThe 200-horsepower engine that is now standard has been tweaked to reduce noise and vibration, but it still sounds a tad coarse when accelerating away from a stop. Power and performance are on par with the other minivans.\n\nInside, the SELÕs leather upholstery and wood trim contributed to its upscale feel. The instrument panel, much the same as before, is easy to read and use thanks to simplified gauges and controls. The requisite dual sliding doors are power operated, which is extremely handy if you need to open the doors with things in your hands.\n\nThe Windstar’s third seat has to be removed for maximum cargo space, which is not as handy as one that folds into the floor.\n\nA reverse sensing system consists of four sensors in the bac k bumper that detect obstacles within 6 feet. As you back up, warning beeps grow closer together until there is a steady tone when the vehicle is within 10 inches of the object. Since rear visibility can be challenging, this system makes backing up and parking much less nerve-wracking.\n\nThe optional video system has a color monitor that folds down from the ceiling for easy viewing by back-seat passengers. The VCR is handily mounted in the center console between the front seats. Rear-seat passengers can control the system from the back of the console, which has audio/visual inputs, volume control, media selection, seek function and headphone jacks. Dual headphones are included so front-seat passengers can listen to the stereo while the kids in the back watch a movie.\n\nPrice The base price of our test model, the top-of-the-line SEL, was $30,920. Options included the reverse parking sensors, trailer towing package and AutoVision family entertainment system. The stic r price was $33,615.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.\n\n{Point:} The Windstar’s excellent safety rating, dual power sliding doors and optional family entertainment center make it attractive to families with small children. Power, adjustable pedals and the soon-to-be-available vehicle stability program make it even safer. The 200-horsepower engine is now standard across in all models.\n\n{Counterpoint:} I prefer a third seat that folds into the floor and the engine is not quite as quiet and smooth as some of its competitors.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6\nTransmission: automatic Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 120.7 inches\nCurb weight: 3,988 lbs.\nBase price: $30,920\nAs driven: $33,615\nMpg rating: 18 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFords minivan, in its volume-leading LX form, has a fresh look for 2002. The Windstar LX now comes equipped with standard driving lamps and body-colored front and rear bumpers. The previous LX minivan came with a single sliding side door, but that feature has been dropped and replaced by a base LX model that sports dual-sliding side doors. Sixteen-inch, machined-aluminum wheels are standard on Deluxe versions of the Windstar LX. Ford previously announced that its AdvanceTrac electronic stability system would become available, but that feature has not appeared.\n\nFord launched the Windstar in 1995, and the minivan comes in a single size with a single powertrain. Four trim levels are available for the passenger minivan: LX (Standard or Deluxe), sporty SE and SEL models, and the luxury Limited. Last years SE Sport model is gone. A cargo van is offered for commercial applications.\n\nLike most minivans in 2001, the Windstar saw a notable sales drop  down 19 percent, to 179,595 units, according to Automotive News. The Windstar again ranked second in the sales race behind the Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan duo and comfortably ahead of the Honda Odyssey. The Windstar has been selling twice as well as the Chevrolet Venture and Toyota Sienna.\n\nExterior\nThe Windstar rides a 120.7-inch wheelbase and measures 201.5 inches long overall. These dimensions make Fords minivan comparable to extended-length versions of other minivans, such as the Grand Caravan and Venture. Dual-sliding side doors are standard. Power operation for both side doors is available, and the dual sliders come as a standard feature on the SEL and Limited.\n\nThe LX comes with standard 15-inch steel wheels, while all other Windstar models are equipped with 16-inch wheels. Passenger models include a pressure-based tire monitor warning system. A strobe light in the drivers outside mirror warns approaching traffic that the left-side sliding door is open.\n\nInterior\nThe cargo model in the Windstar lineup is equipped with front seats only, for the driver and a passenger. The passenger versions seat seven occupants. Two rear bench seats are installed in the Windstar LX.\n\nPrivacy glass and a roof rack go on the LX Deluxe. Stepping up from the LX to the SE adds such extras as cornering lamps, second-row bucket seats, a six-way power drivers seat, lighted vanity mirrors and power heated signal mirrors. Leather seating surfaces are used in the SEL, which has powered driver and passenger seats, as well as Tu-Tone body cladding. The top-of-the-line Limited features heated seats, a full-size spare tire, a premium stereo system and a memory feature for its drivers seat, outside mirrors and power pedals.\n\nA center console is included with models equipped with the optional second-row bucket seats. Other options include power-adjustable gas and brake pedals, Fords reverse sensing system that detects obstacles while backing up, and an Autovision rear-seat video entertainment setup that includes a removable VCR unit and a 6.4-inch screen that pulls down from an overhead console.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll Windstar models use the same 200-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine and four-speed-automatic transmission. The Windstar earned an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) rating.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and traction control are standard on the Limited and optional on other models. In addition, antilock brakes are a standard feature across the board. Ford has long been promoting the fact that the Windstar was the first minivan to earn five-star crash-test ratings in government testing.\n\nFords Personal Safety System works with dual-stage front airbags that deploy with less force, or not at all, according to crash severity. A weight sensor for the front passenger seat is part of the system.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Windstar feels less carlike than most of its competitors, including the league-leading Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan. Fords model also feels a bit tauter and firmer on the road  thats good for stability but adds to the trucklike sensation, which some minivan owners favor while others prefer to avoid. While other minivans in the past few years have moved toward a carlike ride, the Windstar appears to have stood its ground.\n\nFor a while, Fords V-6 engine was among the most powerful in a minivan; nowadays, its about in the middle. The V-6 is eager, but it doesnt cause this minivan to lunge forward when a quick burst of energy is needed. Automatic-transmission shifts are reasonably smooth but noticeable  again, a trifle trucklike. When the Windstar is pushed hard, it also emits a throatier engine sound than some of its competitors. The front seats are acceptable, but theyre not quite as comfortable as those in some rival minivans.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
