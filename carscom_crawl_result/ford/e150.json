      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike its competitors from Chevrolet, GMC and Dodge, Fords full-size, rear-drive van is an old-timer, with a heritage dating back to 1961. For the past 21 years, the truck-based Econoline has been the best seller among full-size vans, though sales dropped by more than 7 percent during 2000.\n\nCargo versions are called Econoline Vans and outsell the passenger-carrying Econoline Wagons by more than a 5-1 ratio. Vans come in three capacity ratings: E-150 (half-ton), E-250 (three-quarter-ton) and E-350 Super Duty (one-ton). Wagons are offered only in the E-150 and E-350 forms, in two trim levels, XL and XLT. Econolines also are marketed in cutaway form or as a stripped chassis.\n\nChanges are few for 2001. A deluxe engine cover console has been installed with dual-bin storage, four cupholders, coin slots and a cellular phone holder. The console is a cover that fits over the engine and extends into the vans passenger compartment, where the storage areas are located. A heavier-duty battery is used now, and front seats add inboard armrests. Vans get a newly standard Class I Trailer Tow package as standard equipment, and a passenger-side airbag has been added to commercial, RV and conversion vans.\n\nExterior\nRegular-length Vans and Wagons have a 138-inch wheelbase and stretch to 211.9 inches in overall length. Extended models ride the same wheelbase, but their bodies are 20 inches longer and reach beyond the back wheels. The E-150 is available only in regular length, while the heavier-duty models come either way. Maximum van payloads range from 1,735 to 4,045 pounds, depending on the model. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are installed on the right side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice at the rear.\n\nInterior\nCargo Vans are fitted only with two bucket seats up front. Regular-size passenger models have seating for eight, with two front buckets and a pair of three-passenger benches. Captains chairs can replace the center bench to attain a seven-passenger capacity. A four-place rear bench boosts capacity to a dozen, and extended Wagons add yet another bench seat to carry 15 passengers.\n\nA cargo organizer goes behind the rear bench seat. A new optional Traveler Package for the E-150 XLT includes two video screens, leather-trimmed seven-passenger seating, running boards and Tu-Tone body paint. Econolines offer 256.5 cubic feet of cargo space in regular form and 309.4 cubic feet for extended models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive engines are available under Econoline hoods. The base engine for the E-150 is a 191-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-6. Next up are two V-8s: a 225-hp 4.6-liter and a 255-hp 5.4-liter. The strongest gasoline engine offered is a 6.8-liter V-10 that cranks out 305 hp, while the heaviest-duty models can have a Power Stroke 7.3-liter turbo-diesel V-8 that generates 215 hp. All models have a four-speed-automatic transmission. When properly equipped, an E-150 can tow up to 7,000 pounds  400 pounds more than the E-150 passenger wagon. The E-350 Super Duty can pull up to 5 tons.\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes and front seat belt pretensioners are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPeople who havent driven an Econoline in a while are likely to find that its changed quite a bit in some ways, but not much in others. As a whole, this van is still the same big box on wheels sporting rear-wheel drive and a separate frame, which Ford launched back in the 60s. On the positive side, the current Econoline Wagon can be equipped with an array of comfort and convenience features and, after a few minutes, its possible to forget its truck origins.\n\nEngine drone, for instance, is less noticeable than in the distant past, which helps to make the latest Econoline less trucky than its ancestors. It maneuvers almost as easily as a smaller van, with relatively light steering. But more effort is needed to judge position on the highway and while parking.\n\nThe 5.4-liter V-8 engine in an E-150 is strong enough to deliver satisfying and safe response to the throttle. Ride quality is decent enough  not as cushioned as most minivans, but easily tolerable. An Econoline needs more correction on straightaways than many smaller vans, and its slab-sided body is affected by wind, but on the whole its reasonably stable. Drivers certainly get a commanding view and, despite the high stance, getting in and out isnt too difficult.\n\nHow does the Econoline stack up against Chevrolet, GMC and Dodge? Brand loyalty is often just as important as the available features for people who want or need a big van.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2008, the E-Series receives new front-end styling similar to Ford’s full-size SuperDuty trucks, with a large front grille and squared-off highlights. The E-Series is available as a passenger wagon that can carry up to 15 people, and there’s a commercial van version that offers up to 275 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nFormerly called the Econoline, the rear-wheel-drive E-150 comes in only one size. Passenger versions are sold in XL, XLT and XLT Premium Wagon trim levels.\n\nA 4.6-liter V-8 is the base engine, and a 5.4-liter V-8 and 6.8-liter V-10 are available. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is standard on all models. A storage system consisting of racks and bins inside the walls of the van is available as a no-charge option.\n(Skip to details on the: E-250, E-350 Super Duty)\n\nExterior\nOffered in one length, both the E-150 van and wagon have a 138-inch wheelbase and are 212 inches long overall. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are installed on the right side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice at the rear. The new, larger grille serves another purpose in addition to making the vehicle look more defined: it allows more air to pass through the cooling systems.\n\nChrome bumpers and aerodynamic headlamps are mounted on the XLT. An XLT Premium package replaces last year’s Chateau edition and features aluminum wheels and running boards, as well as two-tone paint.\n\nInterior\nAimed at commercial applications, the cargo-hauling van is fitted with two bucket seats up front. Passenger models have seating for eight occupants on two front buckets and a pair of three-passenger bench seats. Captain’s chairs in the XLT Premium version replace the center bench, reducing seating positions to seven. Air conditioning and a tilt steering wheel are standard. The XLT adds carpeting, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors. An overhead console and keyless entry are included in the XLT Premium wagon.\n\nCargo volume in the E-150 is 236.5 cubic feet. An optional cargo organizer can be installed behind the rear bench seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo engines are available for the E-150. The base engine is a 225-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8. Stepping up a notch is a 255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8. Each drives a four-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the E-150 van can tow as much as 7,500 pounds, while the passenger van can tow 7,100 pounds. Suspension components have been upgraded for 2008, and the E-Series now has heavier-duty sway bars and larger brakes. The 6.8-liter V-10 is available on E-350 versions.\n\nSafety\nAll E-Series models have dual front airbags. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available. A traction control system and electronic stability system are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAfter a few minutes behind the wheel, it’s nearly possible to forget the E-150’s truck origins. Engine drone is less noticeable than in Ford vans of the distant past. With relatively light steering, an E-150 maneuvers almost as easily as a smaller van. On the other hand, more effort is necessary when parking the van and when judging your position on the highway.\n\nThe 5.4-liter V-8 is strong enough to deliver satisfying and safe response. Ride quality is decent, but it’s not as well cushioned as most minivans. Compared with many smaller vans, the E-150 demands more steering correction on straightaways, but it’s reasonably stable. Drivers enjoy a commanding view, and getting in and out isn’t too difficult despite the high stance.\n\nE-250\nRated for heavier duty than the E-150, the E-250 van has the same engine choices but comes in both regular and extended lengths. Extended vans are 20 inches longer overall but have the same 138-inch wheelbase; maximum cargo volume is 275.1 cubic feet. The maximum gross vehicle weight rating for the E-250 is 8,600 pounds, versus a 7,000-pound GVWR for the E-150. Passenger wagons aren’t available in this series. Back to top\n\nE-350 Super Duty\nAvailable in regular and extended lengths, the E-350 Super Duty has a maximum GVWR of 9,500 pounds. Cutaway versions that can be used for motor homes and box vans are also available. Single and dual-rear-wheel trims are available. The E-350 passenger wagon seats seven, eight, 11 or 12 people; extended-length vans seat 11, 12, 14 or 15 occupants.\n\nThe standard E-350 engine is a 5.4-liter V-8, and E-350 models with the 5.4-liter come standard with an electronic stability system. A 6.8-liter V-10 that generates 305 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque can be installed. E-350 extended passenger wagons can tow up to 10,000 pounds. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe E-Series received new front-end styling similar to Ford’s full-size SuperDuty trucks in 2008, with a large front grille and squared-off highlights. The E-Series is available as a passenger wagon that can carry up to 15 people and a commercial van version that offers up to 275 cubic feet of cargo space. Formerly called the Econoline, the rear-wheel-drive E-150 comes in only one size. Passenger versions are sold in XL, XLT and XLT Premium Wagon trim levels. The E-150 competes with the Chevrolet Express and Dodge Sprinter.\n\n(Skip to details on the: E-250, E-350 and E-450 Super Duty)\n\nNew for 2009\nFor 2009, the E-Series gets a redesigned instrument panel that includes four new upfitter switches, optional factory-installed navigation, V-8 engines that are E-85 capable, and rear doors that swing out 172 degrees.\n\nExterior\nOffered in one length, both the E-150 van and wagon have a 138-inch wheelbase and are 216.7 inches long overall — much shorter than the Dodge Sprinter. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are installed on the right side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice in the rear.\n\nNew rear-door system allows 95-degree opening, but with a light push the opening can increase to 172 degrees\nAvailable chrome bumpers and aerodynamic headlights\n\nInterior\nAimed at commercial applications, the cargo-hauling van is fitted with two bucket seats up front. Passenger models have seating for eight occupants on two front buckets and a pair of three-passenger bench seats. Captain’s chairs in the XLT Premium version replace the center bench, reducing seating positions to seven. Cargo volume in the E-150 is 236.5 cubic feet, smaller than the Sprinter’s 318 cubic feet but about on par with the Express.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nAvailable cruise control\nAvailable power windows, locks and mirrors\nRedesigned door trim panels\nRedesigned instrument cluster\nOptional navigation system\nAvailable in-dash computer with high-speed internet access; mouse and printer can be connected\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the E-150 van can tow as much as 7,500 pounds, while the passenger van can tow 7,100 pounds. Suspension components were upgraded for 2008, and the E-Series now has heavier-duty sway bars and larger brakes. Two engines are available for the E-150, both of which are now E85-capable in the cargo van versions.\n\n225-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 with 286 pounds-feet of torque\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\nStandard four-speed automatic with overdrive\nOptional five-speed automatic with TorqShift that maximizes low-speed torque\n\nSafety\nThe E-Series adds a few more safety features to its list, including a new optional, dash-mounted front passenger airbag cutoff. The 2009 E-Series has a three-star (average) rating in rollover testing, even with standard electronic stability control.\n\nDual front airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control and electronic stability control (standard on all wagons and recreational vans, optional on commercial vans with gasoline engines)\nNewly available rearview backup camera\nOptional factory-installed integrated trailer brake controller\nSide-impact airbags not available\n\nE-250\nRated for heavier duty than the E-150, the E-250 has the same engine choices but comes in both regular and extended lengths. Extended vans are 20 inches longer overall but have the same 138-inch wheelbase; maximum cargo volume is 275.1 cubic feet. The maximum gross vehicle weight rating for the E-250 is 8,900 pounds, versus a 8,520-pound gross vehicle weight rating for the E-150. Passenger wagons aren’t available in this series.\n\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\n\nE-350 and E-450 Super Duty\nAvailable in regular and extended lengths, the 350 Super Duty van has a maximum GVWR of 9,500 pounds. Cutaway versions that can be used for motor homes and box vans have a GVWR of 14,500 pounds. Single- and dual-rear-wheel trims are available. The E-350 passenger wagon can seat seven, eight, 11 or 12 people; extended-length vans seat 11, 12, 14 or 15 occupants.\n\nThe standard E-350 engine is a 5.4-liter V-8, and E-350 models with the 5.4-liter come standard with an electronic stability system. A 6.8-liter V-10 that generates 305 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque can be installed with a five-speed automatic transmission in either model. E-450 extended passenger wagons can tow up to 10,000 pounds.\n\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\n305-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 with 420 pounds-feet of torque (E-350 van/wagon)\n235-hp, 6.0-liter diesel V-8 with 440 pounds-feet of torque (E-350 van, E-350/E-450 cutaway)\n\n(Back to top)",

Formerly called the Econoline, the E-150 competes with the Chevrolet Express and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The E-150 is the base version, with the E-250 Super Duty and E-350 Super Duty versions providing higher gross vehicle weight ratings.\n\n(Skip to details on the: E-250 Super Duty, E-350 Super Duty)\n\nNew for 2012\nAll models receive a standard MP3 jack, and cast-aluminum wheels are a new option. A dual battery system replaces the auxiliary battery configuration as an option.\n\nExterior\nThe Ford E-Series features a large front grille and squared-off headlights. Also, the rear doors can swing out a full 178 degrees. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are standard on the passenger side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice in the rear. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels\nAvailable chrome bumpers\n\nInterior\nAimed at commercial applications, the cargo-hauling E-150 is fitted with two bucket seats.
