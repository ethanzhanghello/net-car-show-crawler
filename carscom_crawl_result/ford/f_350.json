      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that’s engineered to tackle the most extreme towing and hauling challenges. The lineup consists of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks. Buyers can choose from two gasoline engines — a 405-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 and a 430-hp, 7.3-liter V-8 — or a turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel that makes 475 hp in its standard form or 500 hp in high-output form. Every engine is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and a 10-speed automatic is standard across the lineup. The Super Duty’s primary rivals are the Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ram Heavy Duty.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty lineup was redesigned for the 2023 model year and sees a number of available trim and technology updates for 2025, along with a shuffling of standard and optional equipment. A ritzy Platinum Plus Package includes a unique satin-finish grille with bright chrome accents, a Smoked Truffle interior featuring perforated Venetian leather seats with French stitching, and a 2-kilowatt onboard power source for tools and toys. Available towing tech now includes an auxiliary trailer camera, a tire pressure monitoring system for trailers and blind spot monitors that cover the length of whatever you’re towing.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 13,800 to 40,000 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Super Duty’s curb weight ranges from 5,697 to 8,627 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nThree-seat regular cab\n8-inch touchscreen\nFour-speaker audio system\n40/20/40-split, folding vinyl bench seat\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\nWi-Fi hot spot\n17-inch steel wheels\nTrailer-tow side mirrors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-inch digital instrument display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-wheel rear axle\nTremor Off-Road Package\nLeather seating\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty is one of the toughest, most capable trucks available, period. It can be a no-nonsense work vehicle when equipped with a minimum of frills, or it can be a veritable luxury-lined cruiser that also happens to be capable of towing and hauling pretty much anything thrown its way. Speaking of towing and hauling, the Super Duty is available with an unmatched array of smart technology features — including Pro Trailer Hitch Assist and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System — meant to make those tasks much easier.\n\nThere’s no doubt the F-250, F-350 and F-450 are hugely versatile, but they may also be way too much truck for many people. Key rivals, specifically the Ram Heavy Duty, receive more opulent interior trim when scaling up to range-topping variants. The Super Duty’s ride can also get jittery when equipped with off-road hardware, such as the optional Tremor Off-Road Package. Still, when it comes to getting a job done, the Ford Super Duty is among the very best in the business.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that’s engineered to tackle the most extreme towing and hauling challenges. The lineup consists of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks. Buyers can choose from two gasoline engines — a 405-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 or a 430-hp, 7.3-liter V-8 — and a turbocharged diesel 6.7-liter that makes 475 hp or 500 hp in high-output form. Every engine is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and a 10-speed automatic is standard across the lineup. Super Duty rivals include the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500, Nissan Titan XD, and Ram 2500 and 3500.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford Super Duty lineup is fresh from a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, so changes are minimal for 2024. The 6.8-liter V-8 is now capable of running on E85 fuel, and there are minor alterations to the trucks’ standard and available equipment.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 13,800 to 40,000 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Super Duty’s curb weight ranges from 5,697 to 8,627 pounds depending on body style, trim level and equipment. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nThree-seat regular cab\n8-inch touchscreen\nFour-speaker audio system\n40/20/40-split, folding vinyl bench seat\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\nWi-Fi hot spot\n17-inch steel wheels\nTrailer-tow side mirrors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-inch digital instrument display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-wheel rear axle\nTremor off-road package\nLeather seating\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty is one of the toughest and most capable trucks available, period. It can be a no-nonsense work vehicle when equipped with a minimum of frills, or it can be a veritable luxury-lined cruiser that also happens to be capable of towing and hauling pretty much anything thrown its way. Speaking of towing and hauling, the Super Duty is available with an unmatched array of smart technology features — including the Pro Trailer Hitch Assist system and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System — meant to make those tasks much easier.\n\nThere’s no doubt the F-250, F-350 and F-450 are hugely versatile, but they may also be way too much truck for many people. Key rivals, specifically the Ram HDs, receive more opulent interior trim when scaling up to range-topping models. The Super Duty’s ride can also get jittery when equipped with off-road hardware, such as the optional Tremor Package. Still, when it comes to getting a job done, the Ford Super Duty is among the very best in the business.",

      "expert_review": "Flipping through the channels late at night, you may have come across that show: The one with huge men in tights tossing 55-gallon drums full of rocks, towing DC9s with their braided back-hair and waddling through an open field playing ultimate Frisbee with manhole covers.\n\nYou want to, but you can’t look away, even as they chalk up their thighs to prevent their polyester bodysuits from a frictional meltdown.\n\nThe World’s Strongest Man Competition may have a new contestant: The 2011 Ford Super Duty. It’s a super-duty freak.\n\nIf this truck was a person, Congress would have inquiries into performance-enhancing drugs. Its strength is obscene, its power nearly absolute.\n\nDuring some quick testing of the Super Duty at an Arizona rock pit — heavy duty trucks live in pits — I pulled an 86,000-pound front end loader, crawled over boulders and then drove back to the hotel with 1,000 pounds in the bed and four people in the cab and managed to top 23 miles per gallon.\n\nI became Herculean, all the while blasting the air conditioning and sipping a protein shake. (OK, it was a Diet Coke — I don’t need my thighs rubbing together.)\n\nThe redesigned F-Series Super Duty includes more flavors than Baskin Robbins, with variations of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 pickups. They were pretty good before, but now they come with improved powertrains, including Ford’s all new 6.7-liter V-8 diesel engine.\n\nInstead of having some other diesel company produce the engine, Ford took on the job itself — creating a Picasso out of a power plant with a compact graphite and aluminum block.\n\nSeriously, the diesel engine is quiet and smooth and cranks out Magnús Ver Magnússon kind of muscle: 390 horsepower and 735 pound-feet of torque.\n\nInstead of simply putting lots of sound-dampening material around the engine to deaden those clacking injectors, Ford tightened the engine’s configuration, moved pieces around and made it lighter, quieter and more powerful.\n\nIt’s even designed to burn B20 biodiesel, if only someone would sell B20 biodiesel.\n\nWhen you tow with this engine, and nearly everyone who buys a Super Duty tows, you’ll quickly forget there’s 12,000 pounds behind you. (The most it can pull is 24,400 pounds.) That’s about 600 more pounds than even Lithuanian great Zydrunas Savickas could carry during the farmers walk through the Power Pit.\n\nHeavy loads, no big deal\n\nBut the truck only gets better from there. For gas burners, and those who want to avoid the $7,835 diesel premium, there’s a 6.2-liter V-8 gasoline engine that can still pull up to 22,500 pounds with its 385 horsepower and 405 pound-feet of torque.\n\nWith either truck, you’ll end up with the TorqShift six-speed transmission — and you want to end up with that; it’s the real gem to this entire setup.\n\nSilky smooth, it adapts and adjusts to the driver and the weight. Pulling a 10,000-pound trailer up a steep hill for a couple of miles is child’s play. It can handle all of the low-end torque of the diesel and still go on the gas-engine version. (There are some changes to the transmission for the gas model, but it’s basically the same.) The transmission also allows for exhaust braking — a great feature for long downhill runs while towing, though I wish I could have heard it. It will downshift when you need it and keep you from burning up your brakes.\n\nAdd to that a programmable transmission that allows the driver to limit the top gear and manually shift gears with a selector button on the steering column mounted shifter, and you’ve got everything a trailer hauler needs. Ford has also added a hill start assist that gives a driver stopped on a hill a few seconds to move his foot from the brake to the accelerator without the vehicle rolling backwards. (There is also a hill descent control that lets the Super Duty head off-road and roll down boulders without touching the accelerator or brake.)\n\nAll told, the Super Duty engineers and designers were no dumbbells. They carried their weight and then some.\n\nSome of the other features include the trailer sway control and a brake trailer control, mounted on the dash on the right side of the steering wheel. That’s the place most people can reach easily in a hurry; and if you’re reaching for it, you’re probably in a hurry.\n\nFor those who want to haul a fifth wheel, Ford will now offer a factory installed gooseneck substructure that is covered under the warranty. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, it’s OK, but if you do, you know how cool that really is. The system is nearly invisible until you need to use it. It’s genius.\n\nRoom to stretch out\n\nThen there’s inside the cabin. Ford took the super-comfortable seats from its new F-150 and used those in the Super Duty. There are changes throughout, including an optional 4.5-inch LCD screen mounted between the speedometer and the tachometer. It seems to know everything but your birthday. It uses easy-to-understand categories that even Jon Pall Sigmarsson could click through easily if he wasn’t dead. Ford has even included a trailer hookup checklist for novice haulers.\n\nThe only thing missing was a second glove box, a feature other pickups offer and a great place to keep a gun — as long as it is registered and you possess a concealed weapons permit (state laws do apply). There is, however, lockable storage under the second-row seat, a feature hunters will greatly appreciate. And there are lots of cubbies and storage features throughout. Ford also added second-row ventilation — it’s good to keep the air moving in these trucks at the end of the day.\n\nThere’s plenty of space inside the cabin, which can easily fit the top five strongest men in the world. The interior feels both plush and down to business. It’s a work ethic kind of vehicle that simply won’t quit.\n\nAnd it looks like at the end of the day, it heads to the gym to work out and blow off some steam. It’s rippled with power — with lots of lines drawing your eye around the vehicle and the clamshell hood suggesting that there’s so much power under there that designers didn’t have a choice but to try to find a little more space. (In fact, that’s true.)\n\nThe 2011 Super Duty is a powerful tool, and for many customers, the most expensive tool in box — hitting $40,000 easily. But it’s like the winner of the World’s Strongest Man Competition. He is rarely the one who can simply lift the most. He’s the one who can do well in all of the challenges. These pickups won’t shy away from any work, they relish it.\n\nAnd that’s worth staying up late and watching.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport card\n\nOverall:****\n\nExterior: Excellent. Bold and expressive. This truck looks like it means business and it does.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Comfortable, complete and very sophisticated. It lets hard workers rest between job sites.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. Can tow anything attached to it and still provide a smooth quiet ride. Excellent road manners fully loaded or with an empty bed.\n\nPros: Will let you do more work in less time.\n\nCons: Will let you do more work in less time.\n\nGrading Scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Three-quarter-ton pickups such as Ford’s Super Duties are the Clydesdales of the automotive business.\n\nWith uncommon strength and pulling power, these brutes earn their keep by working like a draft horse. They pull big trailers and tote heavy loads without complaint. On top of that, the Crew Cab model can carry four or five people at the same time. Unlike a draft horse, you don’t have to clean up after the truck, but you do have to feed it a goodly amount of fuel (less so for the diesel). Casual driving is not what these trucks were meant to do, and most folks who buy them will put them to work on farms, ranches and construction sites.\n\nAll Super Duty trucks come standard with a trailer towing package and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. When properly equipped, the maximum Class IV trailer weight is 10,000 pounds. The maximum increases to 14,500 pounds for a fifth-wheel trailer. Dual rear wheels, which enhance stability and towing capacity, are optional.\n\nDriving one of these big trucks, however, isn’t the punishment it once was. In spite of its substantial bulk, it can be equipped to be as comfortable and plush as a family car. Power seats, electric windows, six-disc CD player, chrome wheels and a top-notch stereo are not uncommon. The top-line Lariat package has leather seats that look great and feel soft. Reverse parking sensors, mounted in the back bumper, are an option that make parallel parking reasonable.\n\nIn recent weeks I drove two Super Duty Fords: a four-wheel-drive F-250 SuperCab powered by the awesome 7.3-liter Power Stroke turbo diesel and a two-wheel-drive F-350 Crew Cab powered by a 6.8-liter Triton V-10. The 156-inch wheelbase F-350 was somewhat longer than the 142-inch wheelbase of the SuperCab, which lacks the full-size back seat of the Crew Cab. With vehicles of this size, however, the difference in size was fairly negligible. Both demand your full attention to negotiate the bank teller window or fast-food drive-through, and pulling into a parking space at the grocery store can cause gray hair.\n\nOn the road, both trucks feel remarkably agile considering their bulk. The two-wheel-drive F-350 was fairly cushy, despite the lack of a payload to soak up some of the bumps. Four-wheel-drive rides a tad harsher.\n\nThe engine is the heart and soul of a heavy-duty pickup truck. The 7.3-liter Power Stroke diesel cranks out an incredible 505 foot-pounds of torque. A version with 275 horsepower and 520 foot-pounds of torque will be available later in the year. If towing or hard work is your gig, the diesel is the answer. Not only is the torque output substantial, it cranks it right off idle. Believe me, this thing can pull down your house. Unfortunately, it makes such a racket at low speed that only diehard truckers are willing to tolerate it, but the pounding of the diesel is music to their ears. Get it on the highway, though, and it accelerates as smoothly and quickly as a gasoline-engined truck and gets better mileage. Once up to cruising speed, the dieselÕs rattle disappears and it is barely louder than a gasoline engine.\n\nIn contrast to the noisy diesel, the 6.8-liter Triton V-10 is a model of civility, and when it comes to power and torque, it blasts 310 horsepower and 425 foot-pounds of torque. The SOHC V-10 is like a 10-cylinder version of Ford’s 5.4-liter V-8. This powerplant is incredibly smooth and free of vibration, which is not something one expects to find in a heavy-duty truck.\n\nThe automatic transmission has an automatic tow-haul feature that adjusts the shift points depending on load and altitude. An overdrive lockout switch is located on the end of the shift lever.\n\nAs is pretty standard truck practice, the pickup box can be divided into upper and lower sections with boards to create two-tier loading. Tie-down hooks are located in each corner of the bed, and the tailgate on the XLT and Lariat can be locked.\n\nPrice The base price of the F-350 was $ ,940. It sticker price was $33,340.\n\nThe F-250’s base price was $30,414, and its sticker price was $38,374.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com. {Point:} Super Duty pickups have evolved from simple work trucks to vehicles that can do serious work without sacrificing the daily comfort and convenience truck buyers have come to expect. The diesel can tow more and gets better fuel mileage than the gas engines. Most of these trucks will spend their time pulling trailers, hauling construction supplies or delivering hay bales. {Counterpoint:} Life in the city is compromised by long wheelbases and substantial vehicle width, which makes tight turns challenging.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty models are the brutes among Ford’s pickups  heavy-duty trucks designed for serious hauling and towing. The Super Duty line was redesigned for 1999, and though it is based on the F-150, it sports different styling, roomier interiors and stronger chassis and engines.\n\nAll Super Duty models are more than 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight (the weight of the truck and what it can carry in passengers and payload). This means they are exempt from federal safety requirements for lighter-duty trucks and cars. However, a driver-side airbag is standard on all models and a passenger side-impact airbag that can be disabled by a dashboard switch is optional.\n\nExterior\nStyling differences from the F-150 are most pronounced in front, where a massive grille dominates the Super Duty’s nose. Models include regular cabs; four-door SuperCabs with two conventional front doors and two rear-opening rear doors; and four-door crew cabs with conventional front-hinged doors. The F-350 crew cab is available with dual rear wheels, a style also known as a dualie.\n\nThe Super Duty lineup starts with the three-quarter-ton F-250 model (gross vehicle weight of 8,800 pounds) and ends with the F-550 (GVW of 19,000 pounds), a truck with a 6-ton payload.\n\nInterior\nJust because the Super Duty models are beasts of burden doesn’t mean the interiors are all vinyl and steel. Cloth upholstery, leather captain’s chairs and a power driver’s seat are available to coddle front occupants. A split front bench seat includes a folding center armrest that’s large enough to stow a laptop computer.\n\nA folding three-place rear bench seat is standard or optional on SuperCab and crew-cab models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe biggest engine available in the F-150 is the smallest engine for the Super Duty models, a 5.4-liter V-8 with 260 horsepower. A 6.8-liter V-10 with 310 horsepower and a 7.3-liter diesel V-8 with 235 horsepower also are available.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe F-Series Super Duty models are the hard-hauling brutes in Fords full-size pickup line  the ones designed for heavy-duty towing and cargo-carrying. Based on the regular, light-duty F-150 series, the Super Duty has different styling, roomier interiors, and stronger chassis and engines.\n\nFor 2002, Super Duty trucks with the 5.4- or 6.8-liter gasoline engine get an upgrade from a five-speed-manual to a six-speed-manual transmission. Ford says that automatic transmissions with the Triton gas engines have an improved shift feel. Single-beam, jewel-effect headlights have replaced the aero-style headlights on XLT and Lariat editions. A six-way power passenger seat is now standard in the Lariat Crew Cab. New map pockets with integrated cupholders are installed in the rear doors of SuperCab models, and all Super Duty trucks now have a passenger-side front grab handle. All models with automatic transmissions have a new transmission-temperature gauge.\n\nAll Super Duty models have a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)  the maximum allowable weight of a vehicle, its occupants and its cargo  of more than 8,500 pounds. For that reason, they are exempt from the federal safety requirements that lighter-duty trucks and cars must meet. Ford claims that its heavy-duty models outsell similar models from Chevrolet and Dodge combined.\n\nExterior\nThe styling differences between Fords light-duty F-150 and the Super Duty models are most evident up front, where a massive grille dominates the Super Dutys nose. Super Duty pickups come in the following forms: regular cab; four-door SuperCab, with two conventional front doors and two smaller rear-opening back doors; or four-door Crew Cab, with conventional front-hinged doors.\n\nWheelbases range from 137 inches on regular-cab models to 172.4 inches on the Crew Cab dualie. Regular-cab pickups have an 8-foot cargo bed and measure 226.6 inches long overall, while the SuperCab models are equipped with either a 6.5- , 6.75- or 8-foot bed and have an overall length of 231.4 or 247.6 inches. The 6.75- or 8-foot bed can be installed on the four-door Crew Cab, which measures 245.8 or 262 inches long.\n\nThe GVWRs range from 8,800 pounds for the three-quarter-ton F-250 model to 11,200 pounds for the F-350 dualie. Payloads start at 2,390 pounds and reach as high as 5,455 pounds. With a diesel engine, a Super Duty truck can tow as much as 12,500 pounds.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab models seat two or three occupants. Cloth upholstery, leather captains chairs and a power drivers seat are available for buyers who appreciate extra comforts. The split, front bench seat includes a folding center armrest that has enough space inside to stow a laptop computer. A folding, three-place rear bench seat is available on SuperCab and Crew Cab models. According to Ford, the seats in the regular-cab or Crew Cab XLT and Lariat models have increased bolster height and shoulder width for 2002.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSuper Duty models may be equipped with one of three engines. The standard 5.4-liter Triton V-8 produces 260 horsepower and 350 pounds-feet of torque; this is the largest engine available for light-duty F-150 pickups. For additional strength, the 6.8-liter V-10 generates 310 hp and 425 pounds-feet of torque. Buyers who need the highest level of power may choose the Power Stroke 7.3-liter, turbo-diesel V-8, which yields either 250 hp and 505 pounds-feet of torque with an automatic transmission or 275 hp and 520 pounds-feet of torque with a manual gearbox.\n\nAll models can be equipped with a six-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic. Super Duty pickups are available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive and come equipped with an airbag restraint system for front occupants.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe F-Series Super Duty is Ford’s line of heavy-duty pickup trucks, which are available in a variety of configurations and three model series: F-250, F-350 and F-450. The truck can carry as many as six people when properly configured, and competitors include 2500 and 3500 models in the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram truck lines.\n\nTwo engines are available: a 6.2-liter gas V-8 and a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission.\nNew for 2013\nFord debuts a Platinum edition of the Super Duty that comes standard with upscale features like a backup camera, navigation system, MyFord Touch, remote start, power-adjustable pedals, power-telescoping mirrors and 20-inch polished-aluminum wheels. The truck also gets a mesh grille surrounded by satin chrome trim as well as chrome tow hooks, door handles, mirror covers and exhaust tip. Inside, there’s a heated leather steering wheel, premium leather upholstery, woodgrain-style trim, two USB ports, A/V connection points and an SD card slot.\nExterior\nA 2011 restyling brought a “power dome” hood, a bolder grille stamped with a Super Duty logo and an oversized Ford oval badge. Buyers have the choice of an extended cab (Super Cab) with a 6.75- or 8-foot box and a crew cab with four conventional doors and a 6.75- or 8-foot box. Dual-rear-wheel models are available with the 8-foot box. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard trailer hitch receiver\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- and 20-inch wheels available\nOptional PowerScope towing mirrors \nOptional power moonroof\nOptional tubular side steps or running boards\nOptional spray-in bedliner\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty borrows seats from the Ford F-150 pickup truck, and it offers a three-place front bench seat or front bucket seats. The bench seat is split 40/20/40, and a lockable under-seat center storage compartment is optional. A wide center console is available on models with front buckets and includes a bin large enough to hold a laptop computer. On the Lariat, heated and cooled front seats with a memory feature for the power driver’s seat are optional. Crew cab models have a three-place rear bench seat that flips up to reveal a flat cargo floor. An available 4.2-inch LCD screen in the instrument cluster shows fuel-economy information and monitors off-road and towing details.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty is one of the toughest and most versatile trucks on the market, but Ford has left its heavy-duty pickup truck virtually unchanged for 2010.\n\nThe Super Duty is available in regular cab, SuperCab and crew cab in either 4×2 or 4×4 drivetrain. The regular cab comes only with an 8-foot cargo bed, while the other two cabs can be ordered with either an 8-foot or 6.75-foot bed.\n\nThe F-350 SuperCab long bed and crew cab long bed can be ordered with dual rear wheels. The F-450 comes only in crew cab long bed with DRW.\n\nThe trim designations have been changed slightly for 2010: The FX4 off-road package is available for the XL, XLT and Lariat trims. The new Cabela’s trim incorporates the FX4 package and adds Cabela’s embroidery, decals and other features.\n\nA properly equipped F-250 can carry 3,200 pounds and tow more than 16,000 pounds. The F-350 goes up to 5,700 and 18,400 pounds, respectively. The F-450 can carry three tons of payload and has a maximum tow rating of 24,500 pounds (with a fifth wheel trailer hitch).\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Cabela’s special edition pickup is based on the off-road-inspired FX4 trim. Ford says more than 75 percent of F-Series owners hunt or fish, so the Cabela’s package is designed to appeal to those likely to shop at the outfitter. There are interior materials unique to the package and additional lockable storage for firearms.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson edition returns on the F-450 model. This Harley is easy to spot, with large blue flame decals coming from the side vents. The familiar cues of a black leather interior and metal badges maintain the theme.\n\nFinally, Ford is offering a spray-on factory bedliner.\n\nExterior\nThe Super Duty’s bulk is well-proportioned, even on short-bed models.

      "expert_review": "Out of the frying pan and . . .\n\nNo sooner had the car hiker pulled away with the Hummer than another arrived with a Ford F-350 SuperCab Dualie.\n\nHummer, the motorhome-size sport-utility vehicle capable of running up the side of a building, proved only slightly smaller than the ’99 Ford, and we emphasize “slightly.”\n\nDualie has dual rear wheels on each side.\n\nA Dualie is meant for heavy labor.\n\nPull a boat–Queen Mary to Titanic. Pull a horse trailer–enough nags at one time to field a derby. Or install a fifth wheel in the cargo bed and tow a house, which you’ll need if you bet enough on those nags.\n\nThe F-350 Dualie is a man among men with big bulging rear wheel wells to accommodate all those tires.\n\nLike the Hummer, the Ford Dualie fills the parking lane. A Dualie driver who can back up squarely into a parking space without hesitating or overlapping the lines deserves a medal.\n\nWe’ll focus on the ’99 F-350 SuperCab, which also comes with the traditional two wheels on the rear axle. There’s a lot to enjoy about an F-350 SuperCab, starting with a redesign (F-250 too) for ’99.\n\nFord opted to mimic Dodge and its bold Ram with a front end that looks like a huge chrome scowl. No second guessing: This is a work machine.\n\nWhat pleased us most, however, was the 6.8-liter V-10 that achieves 275 horsepower at 4,250 r.p.m. and more important 410 foot-pounds of torque at 2,750 r.p.m. (You can get the V-10 on the non-Dualie SuperCab.)\n\nThe V-10 is smooth and quiet, but delivers a potent burst of low-end power when you have that trailer or house tied in back.\n\nThe government doesn’t issue mileage ratings for trucks more than 8,500 pounds, but the 36-gallon fuel tank attests that while you’ll be able to tow anything not cemented into the ground, you’ll pay lots of dues to the petroleum company in doing so.\n\nWith one occupant and nothing attached to the hitch, the overhead message center reported 10.3 m.p.g. average fuel economy.\n\nThe SuperCab comes with four-doors as standard for easy entry/exit in back. To haul cargo–tools, hunting gear or groceries– in the cabin, the rear seat bottom and back fold to form a floor.\n\nThere’s ample room in back for a couple of adults provided they or the person sitting in front of them is short legged. But the rear seat back is stiff and upright, not pleasant for long-distance travel.\n\nThe Supercab we tested comes with four-wheel anti-lock brakes and dual front air bags. The passenger bag has a cutoff switch should you put a child safety seat upfront. Turn the ignition key in the switch and a bright orange “off” light flashes on, leaving no doubt the bag has been disabled.\n\nA nice touch is the dial in the dash to activate four-wheel-drive on the fly. Stay in two-wheel-drive until needed and then turn the dial to 4WD Hi or 4WD low as the road or off-road surface dictates.\n\nFor those who use the truck as an office, the back of the center front s eat folds down to provide a writing top as well as mini-coin holder. In that seat back, there’s room for pens, paper, calculator and lap-top computer. A dash power plug serves the computer.\n\nThere are some annoyances. Crack the window a few inches for air in the rain and a stream of water flows into the cabin; and when ordering a Dualie, the extended outside mirrors may provide vision around those bulging rear fenders, but they’ll destroy a mailbox if you’re not careful.\n\nOur test vehicle started at $28,745.\n\n>> 1999 Ford F350 SuperCab Dualie\n&#169; 1998 Chicago Tribune Wheelbase: 158 inches Length: 243 inches Engine: 6.8-liter, 275-h.p. V-10 Transmission: 4-speed automatic Fuel economy: Not available. Listing not required on vehicles more than 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight. But don’t expect this truckto unseat the Chevy Metro fo r mileage champ honors. The fuel tank holds 36 gallons. Base price: $28,745 Price as tested: $34,190. Includes $2,655 for preferred equipment package with passenger side air bag with cutoff switch, air conditioning, polished aluminum wheels, 6-way power driver’s seat, remote keyless entry; $335 for 6.8 liter V-10; $970 for 4-speed automatic; $305 for all terrain 16 inch tires; $260 for limited slip axle; $150 for shift on the fly 4WD; $125 for slide open rear window; $55 for power trailer towing mirrors; $150 for chrome rear bumper step; $150 for leather seats; $100 for privacy glass; and $190 for lower-accent two-tone paint. Add $640 for freight. Pluses: Redesign with bold, macho type grille like the Dodge Ram. Smooth, but very potent, V-10. Easy-to-see-and-use passenger air bag cutoff switch. Four-doors. Easy-to-fold rear seat back/bottom to create massive cargo hold. Minuses: Dualie with extended wheel wells makes parking place shrink. Rear seat back upright and not very comfortable. >>",

      "expert_review": "I have one suggestion for every urban cowboy out there who always wanted to look the part, even if it wasn’t always possible to act the part: Check out the Ford F-350 King Ranch.\n\nYou will never find a truck more suited for the cattle-roppin’, Merle Haggard singing, boot-wearing crowd than what Ford has done with its top trim level F-350 truck.\n\nThere’s less leather at a Harley-Davidson convention than in the King Ranch. And that’s only half the story.\n\nThe F-350 can tow a house (or about 19,000 pounds). Haul a city block. And intimidate even the heftiest of vehicles.\n\nFor city folk, it’s too much. (At 10 to 12 miles per gallon, you’d be lucky to get it out of your garage without needing to fill up.)\n\nFor the real cowboys, I’m sure the King Ranch will fit just right.\n\nWhat does King Ranch mean? It’s Ford’s way of super-sizing its truck lineup with a special touch. The Super Duty F-350 4×4 Crew Cab, our tester, is a six-passenger monster that will leave you feeling like you own the road (if you don’t push everyone off it first).\n\nThe exterior is enormous (20 feet long, 8 feet wide and almost 7 feet high). The interior is special.\n\nFrom the center console to the grab handles, everything in the King Ranch is swathed with a supple leather surface. It will make your neighbors jealous, and it will make your truck buddies envious.\n\nFord calls it Castano leather. I call it out of this world.\n\nAnd there’s more.\n\nThere are enough gadgets in the King Ranch to start a missile launch – everything from climate control to a power rear window to a factory-installed, optional trailer-brake controller ($425) that makes stopping power a breeze.\n\nAnd, despite its size, the King Ranch is actually very drivable.\n\nWith a new coil-spring front suspension, the F-350 doesn’t wallow its way around corners or roll around corners. The turning radius is actually fairly tight (for a truck this size) and the ride is quite, well, comfortable.\n\nEven with a few extra pounds on board in the cabin and a full payload in the back and a small boat on the rear, the F-350 didn’t miss a beat.\n\nNearly 7,000 pounds of curb weight puts this vehicle into the commercial category, but it’s amazingly mobile – a true tip of the cap to Ford’s engineers.\n\nOn the highway, the F-350 was even better. It eats up the miles, churning down the interstate with all of the creature comforts of home.\n\nOf course, a 6.0-liter “Power Stroke” V-8 turbodiesel (with a 19,200-pound tow rating) helps out. It’s an engine that roars to life at the turn of a key and springs into action when the pedal is pushed.\n\nNegatives: There aren’t many. If you get past the sheer size, there’s a lot to like here.\n\nOK, so who buys this?\n\nThat’s the $50,000 question, especially for a truck that rolls in at $51,255 (or $37,305 before all of the options).\n\nAt that price, I’m guessing Ford is looking for the horse trainer who wants to head to the Kentucky Derby in style. Or the city guy who wants a luxury truck for the extra farm.\n\nFor the urban cowboys or the rural cowboys, the option is out there.\n\nIt’s called the King Ranch. There’s a reason why. 2005 Ford F-350 King Ranch\n\nVehicle type: All-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, six-passenger truck\n\nKey competition: Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota Tundra, Nissan Titan, Dodge Ram\n\nBase engine (King Ranch): 6.0-liter V-8 turbodiesel\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel ABS; dual front air bags\n\nMPG rating (estimated): 10 city/12 highway\n\nManufactured: United States\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price (F-350): $37,305\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $51,255",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChanges to Ford’s one-ton F-350 Super Duty full-size pickup truck echo those of the three-quarter-ton F-250. A new Harley-Davidson model joins the series in 2004, and later in the model year, SuperCab and Crew Cab versions may be equipped with an optional power sliding rear window.\n\nFord introduced a potent new powertrain for its heavy-duty pickup truck line early in 2003. The 6.0-liter Power Stroke turbo-diesel engine delivers 325 horsepower and 560 pounds-feet of torque and works with a five-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Buyers may choose two other engines for the F-350 Super Duty: a gasoline V-8 or V-10.\n\nThe full-size F-350 Super Duty pickups come in regular-cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab configurations. Each is offered in XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels. An FX4 Off-Road model includes skid plates, Ranch shock absorbers and a steering damper. During the 2003 model year, a King Ranch option group became available. An XLT Sport package also is offered for Crew Cab and SuperCab pickups.\n\nThe new Harley-Davidson model comes in three body colors and has 18-inch aluminum wheels, a chrome tubular step bar, a Harley-Davidson Bar & Shield insert and other distinct styling cues.\n\nExterior\nThe F-350’s front-end styling is similar to the F-250’s; both display a bolder, more upright grille than the one on the half-ton F-150. Full-size F-350 Super Duty pickups are available with a choice of five wheelbases and either a 6.75- or 8-foot cargo box. Regular-cab models have two doors, while SuperCab pickups add rear half-doors. Crew Cab models have four, conventional, front-hinged doors. These pickups may have rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive and single or dual rear wheels on each side.\n\nFord’s King Ranch option features lighted running boards, premium aluminum wheels, body-colored mirror housings and Arizona Beige wheel lip moldings. The XLT Sport package includes chrome tubular step bars, body-colored exterior accents, a sliding rear window, fog lamps and privacy glass.\n\nHeated and telescoping trailer-tow mirrors with integrated turn signals, a power moonroof — intended for Crew Cab pickups — and Ford’s Reverse Sensing System are optional.\n\nInterior\nEither two or three occupants can fit into a regular-cab pickup, depending on the seat type. SuperCab and Crew Cab models hold up to five or six passengers.\n\nThe King Ranch version adds premium leather interior trim. The XLT Sport package includes a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a 40/20/40-split front bench seat with twill cloth upholstery.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 260-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 serves as the standard F-350 Super Duty engine. Optional engines include a 310-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 that produces 425 pounds-feet of torque and a 6.0-liter turbo-diesel V-8 that generates 325 hp and 560 pounds-feet of torque. The diesel engine teams with a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual gearbox. The two gasoline engines mate with the six-speed manual or a four-speed-automatic transmission. Towing capacities range from 7,800 to 14,200 pounds, depending on the engine, rear wheels and drive configuration.\n\nSafety\nOnly the federally required front airbags are installed. Antilock brakes are standard.",

      "expert_review": "When a massive 2003 Ford F-350 pickup was delivered for a week of testing, I was, well, intimidated.\n\nEverything about the F-350 is super-sized … even its name.\n\nFrom the first second I stepped up into the truck’s cockpit, I was in trouble. I could not remember the full and proper name of the vehicle I was driving. For the record, here’s what was on the sticker: 2003 Ford Super Duty F-350 4X2 Crew Cab Lariat 156-inch wheelbase Styleside.\n\nThink that’s confusing? Try making sense of the specifications for the various F-350s made by Ford. Calling them up from the Ford Web site produced a computer screen so packed with numbers that it reminded me of the mass of logarithms printed on my desktop in high school algebra class — another environment where I was intimidated.\n\nThe F-350’s dimensions are staggering. The tested model was nearly 7 feet wide and more than 20 feet long, tipping the scales at almost 6,000 pounds. That made fitting it in the standard-size Sacramento-area parking space an exercise in utter futility. While maneuvering in downtown Sacramento traffic, I’m certain the look on my face all but screamed my thoughts: “Am I still between the lines of my lane!”\n\nPower is likewise gargantuan. Ford dropped a 6-liter Power Stroke V-8 turbodiesel engine into my F-350. The power plant was rated at 325 horsepower and an absolutely monstrous 560 foot-pounds of torque, which kicked in as low as 2,000 revolutions per minute. Today, it’s easy to get jaded with high horsepower and torque, but being pinned to the seat on acceleration in a nearly 3-ton pickup got my attention.\n\nThe engine and a five-speed automatic transmission accounted for most of the optional-equipment charges that sent the tested F-350’s price of $32,825 soaring to $41,380 on the bottom line. Still, having experienced the pop of the 6-liter turbodiesel, it’s hard to imagine settling for anything less spirited in this particular pickup.\n\nI felt like the diesel was waking up neighbors for miles around when I backed the F-350 out of my driveway, but truck-driving friends informed me that the Power Stroke engine was comparatively quiet as diesels go. Pickup pros also liked the trailer hitch receiver that was already equipped to tow seemingly anything up to the size of a five-story office building (actual capacity 13,100 pounds).\n\nBeing a relative novice in the world of gigantic pickups, I was impressed with the leather-covered captain’s chairs front and back. Steering the big brute was incredibly easy; power recirculating-ball steering paired with a sweetly tuned suspension made it possible to put the pickup through its paces with one hand on the steering wheel.\n\nBut do not try one-handing an F-350 around Sacramento! Most of the time, I clutched the steering wheel in a two-handed death grip, fearful that I might stray onto the sidewalk and snap off a fire hydrant.\n\nRight about the time I was g etting used to maneuvering the F-350’s wide track and long length, it was time to turn it back over to its handlers.\n\nIn truth, I was relieved to let it go. For my lifestyle, it was too much truck.\n\nHowever, it was easy to imagine wheeling the big F-350 down Interstate 80 to a work site in the Bay Area. The big pickup easily maintained freeway speed, and there was enough room in the cargo bed to carry a storeful of tools. I could even envision cruising through the fields of the ranch of my dreams, benevolently dropping off bales of hay for my eternally grateful livestock.\n\nIn that world, the F-350 would be perfect — with the bonus of exceptional luxury inside the passenger cabin. Even a city boy could love that.\n\nFord F-350 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2003 Ford F-350 Super Duty 4X2 Crew Cab Lariat Styleside.\n\nVehicle type: Four-seat, four-door, rear-drive, full-size pickup.\n\nBase price: $32,825 (as tested, $41,380).\n\nEngine: 6-liter V-8 turbodiesel with 325 horsepower at 3,300 revolutions per minute and 560 foot-pounds of torque at 2,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nSteering: Recirculating ball with power.\n\nBrakes: Four-wheel discs with power and anti-lock.\n\nSuspension type: Twin I-beam independent with stabilizer bar on front, live axle with leaf springs and shock absorbers on rear.\n\nCargo capacity: 64.7 cubic feet.\n\nTowing capacity: 13,100 pounds..\n\nFuel tank: 29 gallons (diesel)..\n\nCurb weight: 5,836 pounds..\n\nHeight: 77 inches.\n\nLength: 245.8 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 156.2 inches.\n\nWidth: 79.9 inches.\n\nTire track: 68.7 inches on front, 68.1 inches on rear.\n\nGround clearance: 7 inches.\n\nTires: LT265/75RX16E all-season radials.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRated at one ton, the full-size F-350 Super Duty pickup truck comes in regular cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab configurations and is offered in XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels. Dual-rear-wheel versions are available for greater hauling capacity. When properly equipped, an F-350 pickup can haul as much as 17,000 pounds. For 2007, changes are limited to the addition of a few appearance options.\n\nFord says the F-350’s TowCommand System with an integrated electric trailer-brake controller was an industry first. Design revisions for 2005 incorporated elements of the Mighty F-350 Tonka concept truck.\n\nTwo appearance packages are available for 2007: a Highline Package for SuperCab models with single rear wheels and a Outlaw Package for Crew Cab models with single rear wheels. The Highline Package features extensive use of chrome on the grille, tow hooks, step bars and other trim bits, while the Outlaw is a primarily black theme that’s carried over into the interior.\n\nExterior\nFord says “sharp edges and vertical bar surfaces provide a milled appearance” on Super Duty models. The F-350’s front-end styling is similar to that of the F-250’s; both display a bolder, more upright grille than the one on the half-ton F-150.\n\nFull-size F-350 Super Duty pickups are available with a choice of five wheelbases and either a 6.75- or 8-foot cargo box. Regular cab models have two doors, while SuperCab pickups add rear half-doors. Crew Cab models have four conventional front-hinged doors. These pickups can have rear- or four-wheel drive and single or dual rear wheels on each side.\n\nFront tow hooks are standard. XLT models feature a chrome front bumper and bright grille, versus an argent grille for the XL. Stepping up to the Lariat edition adds cab steps, fog lamps and a sliding rear window.\n\nInterior\nEither two or three occupants can fit inside a regular cab pickup. SuperCab and Crew Cab models hold up to four, five or six people, depending on the model.\n\nExtra equipment on the XLT includes air conditioning, power windows and locks, cloth seats, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and a CD player. Power front seats with leather surfaces go into Lariat models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are available in the F-350 Super Duty. The 5.4-liter V-8 produces 300 horsepower, while the 6.8-liter V-10 is rated at 362 hp and 457 pounds-feet of torque. An available 6.0-liter turbo-diesel V-8 generates 325 hp and 570 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a five-speed automatic is optional.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty is one of the more playful trucks on the market, with three interesting theme packages: King Ranch, Harley-Davidson and the new Cabela’s edition. The Super Duty is available in regular cab, SuperCab and crew cab in either 4×2 or 4×4 drivetrain. The regular cab comes only with a 8-foot cargo bed, while the other two cabs can be ordered with either an 8-foot or 6.75-foot bed.\n\nThe F-350 SuperCab long bed and crew cab long bed can be ordered with dual rear wheels. The F-450 comes only in crew cab long bed with DRW. Ford continues with its familiar trim level offerings: XL, XLT, FX4 and Lariat.\n\nThe Super Duty series boasts the highest payload and tow ratings for non-commercial trucks. A properly equipped F-250 can carry 3,200 pounds and tow more than 16,000 pounds. The F-350 goes up to 5,700 and 18,400 pounds, respectively. The F-450 can carry three tons of payload and has a maximum tow rating of 24,500 pounds (with a fifth wheel).\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Super Duty was redesigned for the 2008 model year. For 2009, Super Duty trucks get the new F-150’s electronic features, including Ford Work Solutions, a collection of technologies that help businesses keep track of tools and projects; hands-free, voice-activated Sync; and voice-activated navigation with Sirius Travel Link.\n\nThe Cabela’s special edition pickup is based on the offroad-inspired FX4 trim. Ford says more than 75 percent of F-Series owners hunt or fish, so Cabela’s package is designed to appeal to those likely to shop at the famed outfitter. There are interior materials unique to the package and additional lockable storage for firearms.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson edition returns on the F-450 model. This Harley is easy to spot, with large blue flames coming from the side vents. The familiar cues of black leather interior and metal badges maintain the theme.\n\nFinally, Ford is offering a spray-on factory bedliner; the automated sprayer applies the film in a thinner but uniform manner to reduce weight while minimizing load slippage.\n\nExterior\nThe Super Duty’s bulk is well-proportioned, even on short-bed models. Ford offers a wide range of colors, paint schemes and 19 different wheels to help distinguish the different trim lines and special packages. For commercial customers, there’s a pickup-box-delete option, so custom service bodies can be adapted to the chassis.\n\nPowerScope tow mirrors standard on some models; manual telescoping trailer mirror standard on others\nAvailable moonroof on crew cab\nFront and rear step bumpers help access engine bay, cargo box\nAvailable tubular side steps or running board\nOffroad package includes skid plates\nPower-sliding rear window standard on Lariat, available on other models\nAvailable tailgate step\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty has a luxury option for almost every application. Like the offroad look of the FX4 but want heated leather seats, Sync and a six-CD changer? Order the FX4 Luxury Package.\n\nOther packages include the Lariat Plus, Lariat Ultimate and the Cabela’s Luxury Package. Certain packages require specific trim levels. The Harley-Davidson F-450 and King Ranch have front and rear captain’s chairs with leather-trimmed center consoles.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRated at one ton, the full-size F-350 Super Duty pickup truck comes in regular-cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab configurations and is offered in XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels. Dual-rear-wheel versions are available for greater hauling capacity. When properly equipped, an F-350 pickup can haul as much as 17,000 pounds.\n\nFor 2005, a new 6.8-liter V-10 generated 52 horsepower more than its predecessor, and the 5.4-liter V-8 gained 40 hp. Ford claimed the new TowCommand System with an integrated electric trailer-brake controller was an industry first. Design revisions for 2005 incorporated elements of the Mighty F-350 Tonka concept truck.\n\nEquipment that was previously included just in the Lariat Luxury Package is standard in all Lariat models for 2006. An Amarillo Package for Lariat Crew Cab models features Blazing Yellow paint, 18-inch forged aluminum wheels, black leather seating surfaces and other extras. A Chrome Package is available for XLT and Lariat SuperCab and Crew Cab trucks. Forged polished-aluminum 20-inch wheels are available on SRW Crew Cab 4×4 Lariat, King Ranch and Amarillo editions.\n\nExterior\nFord says “sharp edges and vertical bar surfaces provide a milled appearance” on Super Duty models. The F-350’s front-end styling is similar to that of the F-250’s; both display a bolder, more upright grille than the one on the half-ton F-150.\n\nFull-size F-350 Super Duty pickups are available with a choice of five wheelbases and either a 6.75- or 8-foot cargo box. Regular-cab models have two doors, while SuperCab pickups add rear half-doors. Crew Cab models have four, conventional, front-hinged doors. These pickups can have rear- or four-wheel drive and single or dual rear wheels on each side.\n\nFront tow hooks are standard. XLT models feature a chrome front bumper and bright grille, versus an argent grille for the XL. Stepping up to the Lariat edition adds cab steps, fog lamps and a sliding rear window.\n\nInterior\nEither two or three occupants can fit inside a regular-cab pickup. SuperCab and Crew Cab models hold up to four, five or six people, depending on the model.\n\nExtra equipment on the XLT includes air conditioning, power windows and locks, cloth seats, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and a CD player. Power front seats with leather surfaces go into Lariat models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are available in the F-350 Super Duty. The 5.4-liter V-8 produces 300 hp, while the 6.8-liter V-10 is rated at 362 hp and 457 pounds-feet of torque. An available 6.0-liter turbo-diesel V-8 generates 325 hp and 570 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a five-speed automatic is optional.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "We’ve seen the wildly redesigned heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado and its cousin, the GMC Sierra HD. We’ve been behind the wheel of the new Ram HD pickup trucks as well. And now here it is, finally, the last of the big redesigned trucks: the 2020 Ford Super Duty. Yes, I know, it doesn’t look all that different from the 2019 version, but I assure you, Ford’s done its homework in making the 2020 Super Duty appealing and even more competitive than before.\n\nRelated:  2020 Ford Super Duty: Did the Blue Oval Go Far Enough?\n\nThis is a mid-cycle refresh, as Ford calls it, not a full-on redesign like we saw with the GM trucks. So don’t expect any big styling changes or interior differences, because there aren’t any. What we have instead is a lot of powertrain, suspension and technology work that’s been performed under the hood, combined with a compelling new off-road package that is sure to grab some attention. So if it doesn’t look different outside and it doesn’t look different inside, where the heck did Ford’s product developers spend all the redesign money? They spent it on the underside.\n\nThey spent it on an all-new 7.3-liter gasoline V-8 engine that makes a best-in-class 430 horsepower and 475 pounds-feet of torque. And they spent it on a revised third-generation Power Stroke turbo-diesel 6.7-liter V-8 making a best-in-class 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 pounds-feet of torque. And they spent it on a brand-new 10-speed automatic transmission with three overdrive gears, up to six drive modes and an available power takeoff with a best-in-class maximum of 300 pounds-feet of torque when paired with the diesel engine.\n\nBoth of the engines are fantastic. The new 7.3-liter tows like a champ, and mated to the 10-speed automatic, it feels powerful and responsive in all conditions. I didn’t tow anywhere near the Super Duty’s maximum ratings, but the trailers provided by Ford were representative of what people normally tow with these trucks. From 9,000-pound horse trailers to 11,000-pound campers, neither powertrain had so much as a hiccup in its performance. The best powertrain for towing is, of course, the 6.7-liter diesel engine, mostly due to its superior engine braking abilities when negotiating a downhill stretch. But the new 7.3-liter gas engine is no slouch either and would serve those who occasionally tow but don’t want to splurge on the pricey diesel option. When the trucks are empty, both engines are fantastic performers. The diesel is more responsive than before, now offering some forward thrust with no turbo lag and lightning-fast, smooth downshifts. Both engines are also surprisingly quiet, even under load going up a hill. It’s clear that powertrain refinement was a goal for the Super Duty engineers, and they’ve succeeded admirably.\n\nSo what does all that do for the new Super Duty? It lets Ford claim a whole bunch of best-in-class ratings: payload capacity of 7,850 pounds with the standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 while the diesel gets a maximum gooseneck towing of 37,000 pounds, fifth-wheel towing of 32,500 pounds and bumper towing of 24,200 pounds. But two of these claims are predicated on you buying an Super Duty F-450, which was not a common model in 2019; the F-250 and F-350 are much more popular. The F-250 and F-350 can also claim some best-in-class ratings, from best gooseneck maximum towing to best dually payload ratings. But honestly, best-in-class numbers don’t impress me much. I’m much more interested in how the vehicles drive and operate, and given the big powertrain and suspension changes Ford has made, that’s where I focused my attention.\n\nThe New Tremor Package\n\nThe bigger difference in towing performance came when I switched from a conventional Super Duty to one equipped with the new Tremor Off-Road Package. What’s a Tremor? Unlike before, when the Tremor name was used on an F-150 to denote a special performance version of the half ton, now it’s an equipment package that you can add to a new Super Duty. Ford has cooked this up for the off-road truck enthusiast buyer — the recreationist, one who takes a Super Duty, adds a bunch of parts and turns it into a bro dozer. You know, one of those big off-road trucks with enormous wheels and tires and a lifted suspension, often seen blowing big black clouds of soot out its diesel exhaust pipe? Well, Ford isn’t going to help you screw up your emissions, but now it is offering something that gets you one step closer to a factory bro dozer: the new 2020 F-250 or F-350 Tremor.\n\nThis thing is aimed squarely at the Ram 2500 Power Wagon and the GMC Sierra HD AT4. Ford bills it as both a workhorse and an adventure rig, something able to tow like an HD truck should, but also play like a lot of people increasingly want an HD truck to play. You can add the package to the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch or Platinum trim levels of the F-250 and F-350 as long as it’s the 4×4, single-rear-wheel SuperCrew model with a 6 3/4-foot bed. Like the Ram Power Wagon, it features big tires, 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTracs mounted on 18-inch matte-black wheels. It gets a front-end lift, progressive rate springs and custom 1.7-inch-piston twin-tube shocks. You get a locking rear differential with electronic shift-on-the-fly engagement and a Dana limited-slip front diff. A 12,000-pound Warn winch can be fitted to the front bumper from the factory. And unlike the Ram Power Wagon, you can get the Super Duty Tremor package with a diesel engine — Ram won’t let you do that, since its winch placement screws up the plumbing for the Cummins diesel engine.\n\nSo how do the modifications to the Super Duty work as a Tremor? Well, you can tow with it, given that it has all the excellent powertrain upgrades that other Super Duty trucks have, but it’s not as happy as the other models in doing so. The front end is lighter, the suspension is softer and it’s not really at home as a towing rig. Instead, it’s really meant to boost the Super Duty’s off-road ability, and this it does quite well.\n\nI drove an example through some impressively challenging rock quarry terrain that one wouldn’t assume a huge, portly, heavy-duty truck could negotiate. But thanks to a combination of parts like the big dampers, tires and a screen displaying novel forward-facing and 360-degree camera views, you can take a Tremorized Super Duty through some very tight obstacles and over some completely blind hills with confidence. The Tremor also comes with Trail Control, which acts as a kind of off-road cruise control: It helps you maintain speed going both down a hill and back up it again. That can be useful when you want to focus on maintaining a line over a challenging obstacle and not have to worry about throttle inputs. It also features a Rock Crawl mode meant for making easy work of boulder fields, but I found that it didn’t damp the throttle inputs quite enough to smooth out the jerks and starts. Still, the changes Ford has made for the Tremor package are impressive, and it will give the Power Wagon and Sierra AT4 a good run for the money — at least until they encounter an obstacle that sees the Power Wagon lock its front axle as well.\n\nLooks the Same, Inside and Out\n\nThe new Super Duty isn’t exactly the same in appearance as the outgoing model; there are a few updates to keep it fresh, but you’ll have to look hard to spot them. It has a new grille and headlights, some slightly different bumpers, new wheels and a couple of new colors, but no, it really doesn’t look any different from the outside than the outgoing model. Hey, you want crazy, wacky styling changes? I know there’s a Chevrolet dealer near you with some pretty hefty discounts on a new 2020 Silverado HD right now, but Ford’s not having it. People apparently like the way the Super Duty looks, given the continued sales supremacy that the trucks enjoy. At least, Ford had better hope they do, because what you see is what dealers will be stuck with for the next several years at least.\n\nOn the inside, it’s the same situation. The new HD looks the same as the old one: no big improvements to the materials, no fancy new 12-inch vertical displays, no crazy lighting schemes, not even any unusual colors. The Platinum gets some nicer materials, and the King Ranch interior still looks sumptuous in brown leather. There is some new technology, however, with the arrival of Ford’s still amazing Pro Trailer Backup Assist — it debuted on the F-150 for the 2016 model year — to help you not only connect a trailer but also to help you drive with it behind you. You can’t make the trailer disappear in the rearview display like you can with the Chevrolet trailer system, but you can’t steer the entire truck and trailer combination when backing up with a simple knob on the dash in a Silverado like you now can in a Ford Super Duty. And you can do it with a gooseneck trailer as well, something you couldn’t do before. There’s even something called Trailer Reverse Guidance that helps suggest your next moves when backing up your rig. Pro Trailer Backup Assist takes some preparation of the trailer before you can use it, and it does require you to purchase some extra equipment, but this system turns any novice into a professional truck driver with very little drama. It’s worth whatever Ford is charging for it in peace of mind alone.\n\nStill Not Cheap\n\nFor 2020, a new Super Duty truck can be had at a variety of price levels, depending on how nice and well equipped you want your truck. They start at a low of $35,300 (all prices include destination) for a base F-250 XL model, and can stretch all the way up to $92,125 for a well-equipped F-450 Limited. It won’t be uncommon to see trucks like this selling in the $60,000-$80,000 range, which is sadly common for today’s heavy-duty trucks.\n\nSo if you’re looking for the latest flashy styling or ultra-luxe interior or gee-whiz connectivity technology, you’re going to have to look elsewhere, as the latest 2020 Ford Super Duty doesn’t have any of that. What it does have is massive capability, unshakable competency and a reputation for delivering on its promises that this new version with its new powertrains is only going to make greater than ever. For the brand that’s still the sales champ, that should be enough to continue its popularity.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Ford introduced its latest, burliest Super Duty pickups in a trial by fire and ice. The ice was in the form of a storm that closed south Texas highways and airports, and the fire was courtesy of the shotguns the Blue Oval boys provided for journalists to mercilessly slaughter clay pigeons. Shotguns not only smoke impressively in cold weather, but the warm barrel works as a hand warmer!\n\nFull credit to Ford for having the guts to order up an ice storm for truck testing. Full-size pickup truck manufacturers will go to no end in search of new gimmicks designed to reinforce the impression of tough capability for their trucks. Pull locomotives? Done. Dropped from the sky? Done. Churn through mud in slow-mo? Done.\n\nBut Ford pioneered new frontiers of effort by arranging for journalists to sample the first of its burly new Super Duty pickups during a raging ice storm. That’s tough! Obviously, Ford had already used its weather control technology to verify the trucks were up to the challenge, because they performed perfectly in the slick conditions, both on- and off-road.\n\nRecognizing the seemingly insatiable demand by truck buyers for ever tougher, more capable trucks, in 1998 Ford remade its heavy-duty line with the introduction of the Super Duty trucks. These are built on their own, stronger, chassis rather than using the same foundation as the high-volume F-150 half-ton pickups. The company now sells 380,000 of its work-ready heavy-duties each year and sales are growing because of increased use of the trucks by “personal use” drivers who might tow boats or horse trailers.\n\nNow Ford has expanded the beachhead it established in the niche between light-duty pickups and medium-duty commercial trucks with stronger-than-ever F-250 and F-350 pickups. But Ford’s ace in the hole is a new F-450 pickup, a model never previously available, with a gigantic 24,000 lb. towing capacity. The company predicts it will sell 10,000 of these uber-pickups each year. The F-550 continues to be available only as a chassis cab.\n\nThe Super Duty receives an all new 350-horsepower, 650 lb.-ft., 6.4-liter PowerStroke diesel V8 and carries over the 362 horsepower, 457 lb.-ft., 6.8-liter Triton gas V10. The diesel is the focus of attention, and the company promises that the new PowerStroke, with a common-rail injection system and piezoelectric injectors, leaves behind all the headaches of the old PowerStroke’s injection system.\n\nIn addition to more payload and towing capacity, and more powerful engines, the new Super Duties also provide that key “Built Ford Tough” macho feature: more comfort amenities. The new trucks are better-riding, the seats are wrapped in rich Chaparral leather, and there is a nifty fold-out step built into the tailgate that makes it easier to climb into the bed.\n\nDrivetrain\n\nBecause three-quarters of all Super Duty trucks are diesel-powered, the new oil-burner is the more interesting of the engines. There is also considerable interest because of the durability problems with the outgoing 6.0-liter PowerStroke engine. Those problems were attributable to the fuel injection system’s need for calibration that was tolerant of various levels of fuel quality, according to chief engineer Pete Reyes. By the 2007 model year, reliability scores for the 6.0 PowerStroke topped those of the tried-and-true 7.3-liter, he said.\n\nFord says the 6.4-liter PowerStroke is all-new, and that is mostly true. The engine is based on the same basic architecture as the 6.0-liter engine, but the parts are upgraded. Only the crankshaft is carried over from the old engine, with everything else replaced.\n\nThe significant change is the replacement of the old hydraulic fuel injection system with a modern common rail system featuring piezoelectric injectors. This high-tech system is key to the new PowerStroke’s ability to meet the tough gas engine-equivalent emissions rules.\n\nThe other critical part of the new induction system is the sequential turbocharger assembly. The combination of a quick-reacting variable-geometry small turbo with a high-volume large unit gives the PowerStroke the quick reflexes and maximum power that customers demand. Ford says that tests indicate the new engine powers the Super Duty to 60 MPH a second faster than the old 6.0-liter did. The injection system also contributes to a promised cold start capability down to minus 20 degrees F.\n\nThe large catalyst and particulate trap permit the truck to earn the clean bill of health from the EPA, but they do cost a bit of power because of the increased back pressure. Further, the system for cleaning the particulate trap involves sending extra fuel through the engine to help burn off the gunk in the trap, and that periodic fuel use puts a small dent in the truck’s fuel efficiency.\n\nThe engineering team balanced emissions, power and efficiency, but because of the new government regulations for diesel emissions, that factor had to take priority. Ford insists that unlike the 6.0-liter’s trouble-plagued launch, the new 6.4-engine is thoroughly tested, with more than ten million equivalent miles of testing in both trucks and on engine dynos.\n\nDrivers who have no truck with diesels can still choose the 6.8-liter Triton V10 gas engine. Transmission choices are a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic. I drove only the automatic, which is well-calibrated, with smooth shifts in casual around-town driving, while also delivering smart gearchanges in harness. Climbing hills, pulling trailers and hauling a load, the transmission makes good decisions about downshifts, when to hold a gear for a while, and when to upshift.\n\nWhile Ford doesn’t have a name-brand transmission like GM’s Allison gearbox, the company has experienced good reliability with its much less-expensive in-house transmission, Reyes said.\n\nChassis\n\nThe F-250/350 Super Duty frames are made using thick 6.7 mm steel outer rails, and the F-450/550 gets 8.1 mm steel. The cross members are both welded and riveted, a belts-and-suspenders approach that Ford says tops the either/or approach of competitors.\n\nThe front section of the frame is fully-boxed, for maximum strength, which is critical for customers such as landscapers, who may mount a snow plow on the trucks, said Reyes. The entire frame is e-coated for corrosion resistance.\n\nA significant detail of the frame’s construction is that the very front frame horn section drops down seven inches to mount the bumper. This puts the Super Duty’s front bumper in better line with the protection systems in passenger cars, so that in the event of a collision the occupants of the car are less likely to be injured. High bumpers and stiffer frames can worsen the effects of collisions between different-sized vehicles, so the front frame horn not only lowers the bumper nearer to car height, but it is also constructed of dimpled steel that will crush in accordian-style in a crash to reduce the force of the blow.\n\nWith this virtual bridge truss as the foundation, Ford installs suspension appropriate to the expected work load. Two-wheel-drive F-250s and 350s rely on the ol’ Twin I-Beam swing axle suspension used by Ford since the Iron Age. In this iteration stiffer bushings and revises attachment links on the anti-sway bars improve ride and handling, and a steering damper reduces vibration. The front portion of the Gross Vehicle Weight is boosted from 4,800 lbs. to 5,250 lbs.\n\nThe four-bys get a moonbeam solid front suspension using coil springs and radius arms designed to minimize axle wind-up under acceleration. The design enables a reduced turning circle of 46.1 ft. for the regular cab, long-bed pickups. The two-wheel-drive trucks U-turn in 47.7 ft.\n\nThe F-450/550 rides on a solid front axle, either two- or four-wheel-drive, mounted with twin-coil suspension. The solid axle not only provides durability, but its wider track lets the front wheels turn at sharper angles for a reduced turning circle size of only 42.3 ft. for the regular cab. The big crew cab long bed F-450 pickup turns around in 51.5 ft.\n\nThe rear suspension is the business end of any pickup truck, so Ford put some extra effort into this area. The seemingly contradictory requirements of both higher payloads and increased personal use — which means customer demand for better unladen ride — posed an obstacle, but vehicle dynamics supervisor Dan Gompper’s Super Duty team scaled it like a Super Duty 4 x 4 conquering the slimy mud of a south Texas construction site in an ice storm. That means they met the seemingly impossible task with poise and determination that prevailed impressively.\n\nLeaf-sprung solid axles have known pros and cons. They are strong and have excellent load-carrying capability, but are given to rough ride and axle-hop under hard acceleration. The solution was longer leaf springs. The new trucks’ leaves stretch eight inches more to mount farther forward on the frame. These longer springs have fewer leaves, contributing to a smoother ride. Stiffer bushings meanwhile contribute better roll control in cornering and the staggered shock mounts provide an improved ratio for the shocks’ damper action.\n\nThis rear suspension was also designed to keep the rear of the trucks low to better tow fifth-wheel and gooseneck trailers.\n\nF-450\n\nTowing those trailers is the raison de etre of the F-450 pickup. Its appeal is obvious, leaving us to wonder why Ford didn’t offer a pickup bed on the F-450 chassis cab previously. After all, aftermarket companies sold the trucks with pickup beds, right?\n\nAftermarket companies don’t have the same durability requirements for their products that Ford Motor Co. has, replies Reyes.\n\nThe problem was that previous F-450s used industry-standard straight frame rails 34-inches apart to accept various aftermarket beds. Pickup-type beds won’t survive mounted on narrow frames because of the twisting forces that have greater leverage on the narrow mounts. “The box wouldn’t survive our durability cycle,” Reyes explained. “You couldn’t distribute the loads properly over the box on the narrow frame.”\n\nFord’s solution was to redesign the F-450’s frame to spread wide aft of the cab, providing a secure platform for the bed. But now the wide frame rails ran too close to the massive commercial-duty axle used on the F-450.\n\nOne of the benefits of those axles is the huge brake assembly. But over suspension’s range of travel, the mounting heads on the large brake calipers could contact the frame. “This isn’t a drop-in axle,” he said. “We are pushing the limits on the size of the components you can put in a traditional pickup.”\n\nThe solution was to use half-height mounting bolts to shave some space on one side of the problem, and to design some indentations in the frame for extra clearance on the other side.\n\nNeat Features\n\nA pickup truck touch is the use of a mid-mounted fuel tank, leaving space out behind the axle to carry the spare tire. Also at the rear of the truck is an innovative step ladder build into the tail gate that folds out to make it easier to climb into the truck’s bed.\n\nA quick tug on the ladder extends it from an open tailgate, and another motion snaps a grab-handle into its upright position. The ladder looks like the kind of thing that manufacturers have been co-opting from the aftermarket in recent years, but nothing like this existed before.\n\nFord’s engineers got the idea when a couple of them spotted a removable step installed on a tailgate at the annual SEMA show. Looking at the tailgate, which they knew to be hollow, they started plotting ways to use that space to house a deployable step.\n\nA couple customer clinics found strong interest from truck owners, who even said they liked the step enough to switch from competitor’s trucks to get it, so Ford aggressively pursued the idea. While the step looks a little flimsy, the company says it will hold 1,000 lbs., so do not fear additional stops at Waffle House will render it unusable.\n\nLike the F-450’s bed, more effort went into the step than its appearance might suggest. “It was just a matter of working through bugs, and improving the weight, smoothness, life expectancy,” Reyes said. Additional testing found a grab-handle was a must, and the team went through five different versions of that. The step itself is designed to OSHA specs, so professional users should be satisfied if their employees use the device.\n\nBed extenders have been around for years, but they have always been intrusive when not in use, so Ford developed the Super Duty’s new collapsing bed extender to fold completely out of the way. “Customers said, ‘Get it out of my way,'” said Reyes. “If you look at it, the problem became one of simple geometry.”\n\nSimple maybe, but Ford is the first to solve this particular problem. Another folding component is the Super Duty’s outside mirrors. The truck has the industry’s first power extending and folding mirrors. This lets drivers easily slide out mirrors on both sides when towing, and not only retract them for regular driving, but even fold them both in for parking in tight spots.\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nInside the Super Duty’s cab, occupants are left to wonder if this could possibly be a work truck, considering the abundant leather in the Lariat and King Ranch versions (and in the Harley-Davidson edition in the future). But professional drivers practically live inside their trucks, and personal users tend to employ them on long drives towing trailers to distant locations, making virtually all of the Super Duty’s customers sensitive to the amenities available.\n\nSirius Satellite Radio, dual-zone climate control, quiet steel laminated dash panel, more insulation and thicker window glass all combine to make the Super Duty’s cabin a comfort palace unrecognizable to those of use whose first trucks had AM radios and no A/C.\n\nFor those diesel veterans accustomed to freezing on cold days, the Super Duty offers a welcome innovation in the form of an electric heater. The Rapid-Heat cab heater starts making heat instantly and supplements the diesel’s meager heat output whenever needed.\n\nThe TowCommand system looks like another electronic doodad, but it is in fact a miraculous breakthrough in trailer brake technology, as anyone who has used the system since it appeared on the previous generation Super Duty well knows. The device is an electronic trailer brake controller that is built into the truck, so it has the benefit of knowing everything about the vehicle’s systems and the driver’s inputs, so that it can provide the correct amount of braking force to the trailer, rather than having to guess at the correct amount as add-on brake controllers do.\n\nNew for the ’08 models is smarter software that lets the trailer brakes work better on slippery surfaces where the truck’s antilock brake system is active, and especially in those tricky situations when one side of the truck is on, say, the dry crown of the road, while the other side is on a wet or icy edge. Forget the tailgate step; TowCommand continues to be a reason to buy a Super Duty over a competitor.\n\nHammer the brake pedal with the truck pulling a massive 20,000 lb. fifth-wheel camper and it hums uneventfully to a stop in a normal-seeming distance. The truck’s brake pedal is long, as seems to happen with hydraulically boosted brakes on diesel trucks under heavy braking, but keep pressing and it keeps slowing the truck more. There was simply no indication of any activity from the trailer. It didn’t seem to push us onward, it didn’t wiggle, and it certainly didn’t smoke or flat-spot any of its tires. It just stopped.\n\nThe F-450’s precise steering is appreciated when pulling such a big trailer, making it easy to keep the rig in the center of the lane with no difficulty. On the open road without the trailer, the F-450 rides better than we have any reason to hope, its longer leaf springs working as advertised to soak up bumps without punishing the occupants. Broken pavement makes itself known, as should be expected, but in regular conditions an empty F-450 dually gives the driver no reason to wish for a payload.\n\nThe Super Duty F-450 still falls short of the tow rating of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Kodiak medium-duty truck with a pickup bed conversion performed by a an aftermarket company such as Monroe. The Ford would be easier to live with when unhitched, more comfortable and better-equipped with luxury features and at a lower price too. The massive commercial-duty rear axle and brakes, combined with the smart brake controller make the F-450 an impressive hauler. But if exorbitant towing capacity is the overriding issue, an almost-big rig like the Kodiak is the way to go.\n\nThe F-250, which we also drove unladen, has the ride and handling of a half-ton truck. At least that of a half-ton truck before the latest generation of half-tons moved more solidly into car-like ride. Personal use owners won’t regret the days they have to use their truck as a car thanks to the many upgrades to the Super Duty’s frame and suspension, as well as the interior amenities.\n\nOff-road, in more-than-axle-deep slime, even in four-wheel-high, the truck powered through uneventfully. This included impressively deep ruts and some very steep climbs over wet rocks, with no instance when the truck felt out of control, in danger of getting stuck, or had the driver wishing he’d selected the low range in the transfer case.\n\nYou will never get stuck, but if you ever need to pull anyone else out, the Super Duty has 27 mm closed tow hooks that will support 33,000 lbs. So you can lift out a couple of the other guys at once.\n\nMaybe the Ford guys can add that test to the fire and ice trial next time around.",

      "expert_review": "The Ford F-Series Super Duty configurator is already a dizzying place, with F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks available with three cab sizes, two bed lengths, five trim levels, four engines, and single- and dual-rear-wheel configurations. For the 2026 model year, there are even more choices.\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Super Duty Review: Subtle Upgrades, More Jaw-Dropping Tech\n\nThose new choices come in the form of previously — or at least recently —unavailable combinations of existing elements. The SuperCab, with its rear-hinged rear doors and smaller backseat than the Crew Cab, can once again be paired with the short 6.75-foot bed. In recent years, the SuperCab was only available with the 8-foot box.\n\nPerhaps motivated by the Ram Rebel’s available Cummins diesel engine, Ford is now offering its 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8 on trucks equipped with the Tremor Off-Road Package. Similarly, the STX Appearance Package is now available on the F-350; it includes body-color bumpers, a painted grille, STX decals and interior upgrades.\n\nFord has also bundled a handful of popular options into the new Lariat Premium Package, which includes running boards, a power-sliding rear window, the Co-Pilot 360 2.0 safety-tech suite, and a trio of technologies aimed at simplifying the tasks of hooking up a trailer and maneuvering with one attached. Creating a new void of the sort addressed by this year’s additions to the ordering guide, the Lariat Premium Package is only available on trucks equipped with the optional 7.3-liter V-8 engine.\n\nRead More About the Ford Super Duty:\n\nLuxe Truck: 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Adds Fancy Features, Towing Tech\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nIs the 2023 Ford Super Duty a Good Pickup Truck? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\n2023 Ford Super Duty Up Close: More Useful Tech Is Always Good\nResearch the Ford F-250\nSome Things for Everyone\n\nFinally, tire pressure monitors are now standard across the Super Duty lineup. All buyers also now have the choice to sign up for seven years of the Ford Connectivity Package with a one-time purchase; the package includes cellular connectivity, a Wi-Fi hot spot, audio and video streaming, a voice assistant and connected navigation.\n\nShoppers can now order their 2026 Ford Super Duty at their local dealership. Pricing for the full lineup will be available soon.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Styling and interior changes are subtle, but the 2023 Ford Super Duty heavy-duty pickup truck continues to push the cutting edge of technology with some stunning new towing systems.\n\nVersus the competition: “Max towing” or “most powerful” numbers don’t mean anything (they change almost monthly), but where the Ford stands out from its competitors is in the remarkable, genuinely useful technology it brings to help owners use their trucks more efficiently and safely.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of the Super Duty lineup of pickup trucks to Ford Motor Co.’s bottom line. They’re massively profitable and extremely popular vehicles, and you can bet it’s their continued influx of profit that’s funding a lot of the company’s shift toward electrified vehicles. But that electrification is skipping the big heavy-duty truck class for now largely because the technology just isn’t ready yet. Instead, gas and diesel engines still rule the land because those are what work for these trucks, and these trucks are what work for people who use their trucks for professional purposes. The Super Duty (available in F-250, F-350 and F-450 versions) is first and foremost a workhorse — 90% of Super Duty owners tow with their trucks, according to Ford, so that’s one area the company has focused on for this update for the 2023 model year. Some new styling, two new engines, and a host of revisions and refinements help keep the Super Duty competitive against a new set of GM pickups also arriving for 2023. So what has Ford done to keep the Super Duty on top?\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Super Duty: Ford’s Workhorse Gets Some New Grunt and Updated Tech\n\nIs It a Ranger XXL, Or Is the New Ranger a Baby Super Duty?\n\nThe most obvious and perhaps least important aspect of the new ‘23 Super Duty is its updated looks — the family resemblance to the rest of the Ford truck showroom might not be obvious at first, but then have a look at the new 2024 Ranger mid-size pickup that’s just been unveiled and you’ll get it. It looks like a Ranger XXL — or maybe the Ranger is a baby Super Duty now? Either way, it’s a big, boxy truck with a big, boxy look. The sides and rear are slightly cleaner, as well, but it still pretty much looks like the outgoing truck, with the big C-channel-style LED running lights up front and a multitude of trim levels to choose from, each with their own grille and wheel styles. The Super Duty styling wasn’t broken, so nobody tried to fix anything — unlike the revisions to the latest GM trucks, which saw some pretty significant changes from the last update to the current one, as the styling of the last ones was rather controversial.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore Significant Changes Inside\n\nThe updates to the cabin are a bit more significant than the ones to the styling, but they are again evolutionary, as they should be. Cabin materials have taken another step up the niceness ladder but still fall short of the benchmark Ram HD cabins when you compare the top luxury trim levels. Ford needs to figure out how to make the cheap, smooth plastic on the dash, consoles and doors not feel like cheap, smooth plastic. The leather quality in trims like the Platinum and King Ranch (especially the latter) is excellent, the colors are on point and the new interior styling is top notch, too. Comfort is also excellent, with big, supportive seats and more cabin room for passengers than you could possibly ever need.\n\nThe controls adjustability is also superior to that of the GM trucks — the steering wheel and seats seem to have more adjustability, and visibility is notably better than the GM trucks. A lower hood, taller windshield and lower beltline make it feel like you have more glass than steel around you, making it easier to see out.\n\nThe big new displays inside are also excellent. Ford is sticking with its own proprietary Sync 4 multimedia system, not yet going to Google Built-In as some automakers have, and that’s a good thing. It simply works better than the Google-based systems I’ve tried in GM’s trucks; it also has better resolution and is easier to reconfigure. Most of the trucks I sampled during the introduction to the Super Duty at Ford’s Michigan Proving Grounds north of Detroit were Lariat-trimmed and above, so they featured the big new 12-inch touchscreen paired with a 12-inch digital instrument cluster that’s standard on all trims. It’s augmented by the new optional full-color head-up display that adds yet another futuristic dimension to the new truck. And thankfully, there are still plenty of hard buttons and knobs for more frequently used controls, so you’re not constantly trying to use touchscreen controls.\n\nA Bit More Grunt\n\nThere’s a choice of four engines in the Super Duty, including a new base engine: a standard 6.8-liter gasoline V-8 engine making 405 horsepower and 445 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard 10-speed automatic transmission that’s used with all of the engines. You can upgrade to a carryover 7.3-liter gas V-8 engine making 430 hp and 485 pounds-feet of torque, but if you’re like the majority of Super Duty owners, you’re going to opt for the diesel powerplant. The entry diesel is a turbocharged 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 with 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 pounds-feet of torque, but you can also upgrade to the new high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 that makes a lunatic 500 hp and 1,200 pounds-feet of torque. That’s just about enough torque to shift the orbit of the moon, but it’ll probably be upstaged next week when Ram or Chevy somehow find a bit more power out of their own diesel engines so that they’re the class leader for a while. Chasing the “most powerful” prize is a fool’s errand; at those high levels of torque, everything seems to operate the same anyway — incredibly capably.\n\nThat’s how the Super Duty works, at any rate. At Ford’s proving grounds, we were able to sample the new Super Duty performing all manner of workhorse tasks: I towed a 40,000-pound gooseneck trailer up and down a 7% grade with no problem whatsoever. I also towed a slightly lesser 30,000-pound trailer in a much more commonly available trim combination of the Super Duty, also with no problem or difficulty. Yeah, the big diesel is breathing hard, but that roar is actually the massive cooling system doing its job and keeping the big diesel mill nicely chilled. It will actually accelerate up that 7% grade with your foot to the floor while lugging the big trailer, that’s how much torque you have to play with. It’s practically overkill, but if it were me out in the real world lugging something that heavy, overkill with torque is exactly what I’d want. The thing is, who is actually towing a 40,000-pound trailer on a public road with a pickup? That, to me, seems like the kind of thing you do with a Class B truck, but you can certainly do it with a Super Duty, as well (provided you have a commercial driver’s license).\n\nRefinement Is Clear\n\nThe excellent part of driving this new Super Duty is not how it behaves with a huge load behind it; I expect it to be able to achieve amazing feats of strength when pushed to its limits, and it does that without drama. What’s more amazing is that it’s quiet, refined, comfortable and pleasant to drive without a load behind it, which is far more difficult to achieve. In order to have a truck that can perform feats of strength, heavy-duty equipment has to be present, and it often leads to a bouncy ride, a loud engine and steering that’s numb and odd to use. Not so in the new Super Duty; Ford engineers have crafted a truck that’s all-day pleasant to use even when not towing or hauling anything. It drives like a smaller, lighter truck. Both the diesel and, especially, the gas engines are quiet and refined at speed or when accelerating. The transmission isn’t clunky or harsh. The steering feels natural and isn’t overboosted. This might be the closest the Super Duty has ever come to feeling like the light-duty F-150 in recent memory.\n\nWhere it’s not as pleasant is off-road, where its sheer size and weight means it feels like riding an elephant through the woods. The Tremor off-road package first appeared on the Super Duty before proliferating throughout the Ford truck lineup, and it does indeed boost the capability of the Super Duty with a more off-road-ready suspension, 18-inch wheels with 35-inch tires, underbody protection and off-road tuning (including the addition of Trail Turn Assist, which you frankly need off-road given the Super Duty’s massive length). But it’s too big to be an enjoyable experience in the dirt. As a work truck to get you to a logging camp or a remote construction site, it’ll do, but it wouldn’t be my first choice for wheeling through the rough.\n\nWhere the Magic Happens\n\nThe real story of the ‘23 Super Duty isn’t in the powertrain, the numbers or the new cabin, it’s the new technology debuting on the truck that’s going to make it the envy of the industry. We were impressed when Ford first showed us Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a system that, once you’ve set it up, allows you to reverse your pickup and trailer combination using just the backup cameras and a knob on the dash. No trying to figure out if you turn the steering wheel left or right when reversing, what direction that’ll send the trailer. You just use the guidelines to point the trailer in the direction you want it to go, operate the pedals, and everything becomes so much easier.\n\nWell, now there’s something even more jaw-dropping: Using the backup camera and radar sensors in the Super Duty plus some extraordinary computing power, the truck will now automatically back itself up perfectly aligned to hook up a trailer. Line it up in front of the trailer in question, push a few buttons on the touchscreen to activate the newly available Pro Trailer Hitch Assist system, take your feet off the pedals and your hands off the steering wheel, and the truck will back itself up to align a conventional hitch ball with the trailer coupler. All you then need to do is lower the trailer onto the ball, and off you go. There are several step-by-step prompts from the onboard computer along the way, but it completely takes the guesswork and teamwork out of trying to hook up a trailer to your Super Duty. It is perhaps the ultimate marriage-saving device if YouTube videos of amateur boaters launching various crafts is anything to go by.\n\nThat’s not the only bit of brilliant tech to debut. You know how you lose the backup camera in a pickup truck when you have the tailgate down? Maybe you have the tailgate lowered to back up to a loading dock to have a bunch of stuff dropped into the bed? Well, Ford has solved that problem, too, with the new available Tailgate Down Camera and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System. They’ve put a second backup camera and radar sensors in the top of the tailgate, meant to activate when the tailgate’s been lowered, so you have full backup camera and sensor functionality. It’s one of those systems that leaves you wondering why nobody’s thought of this before.\n\nThere are a host of other new innovations for the Super Duty, as well, such as a navigation system that can incorporate the size and weight of the trailer you’re towing into directions, helping to avoid low bridges or super-tight corners that might be problematic. The blind spot warning system adds trailer coverage for fifth-wheel and gooseneck setups to detect vehicles alongside the trailer (additional equipment is required, however). There’s an electronic Onboard Scales with Smart Hitch system that automatically measures not only the weight of the payload in the bed, it also can detect if your trailer’s load is balanced properly based on the change in the tongue weight. It even lets you adjust the trailer load and get visual feedback in real-time using the LED taillights as guides. It’s a compilation of astonishingly useful, genuinely usable technology that will make owner-operator’s lives easier and safer.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Ford Super Duty Up Close: More Useful Tech Is Always Good\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD: New Face, New Interior, More Diesel Power, ZR2 on the Way\n2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Joins the Off-Road Party\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-250\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-350\nCome and Get It\n\nThe new Super Duty’s updates should make it even more desirable than the outgoing model, securing its position as the likely sales leader for the segment quite nicely. By offering more choices, more refinement and some game-changing technology, the new Super Duty becomes more useful than ever for a wide, wide range of customers.\n\nPrices vary depending on options and requirements, but suffice it to say that you can spec a Super Duty from the base F-250 XL regular-cab 4×2 with the 6.8-liter gas V-8 from $45,865 (all prices include a whopping $1,895 destination charge) all the way up to the F-450 Limited crew-cab 4×4 dually with the high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel for an eye-watering $110,000-plus with options — or anywhere in between, as your needs require and your wallet allows. The number of build combinations is astonishing, but so are the number of uses the Super Duty can fulfill. And with the new 2023 model’s advanced tech, more powerful engines and nicer cabin, it’ll continue to be a useful tool for the foreseeable future.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe F-Series Super Duty is Ford’s line of heavy-duty pickup trucks, which are available in a variety of configurations and three model series: F-250, F-350 and F-450. The truck can carry as many as six people when properly configured, and competitors include 2500 and 3500 models in the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram truck lines.\n\nTwo engines are available: a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 and a 6.2-liter gas V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nNew for 2012\nA strengthened frame and trailer hitch provides 17,500 pounds of conventional towing capacity when properly equipped. Ford also offers a CNG/LPG prep package for gas-engine trucks, and a gooseneck hitch is available for the 6.75-foot cargo box.\n\nExterior\nA 2011 restyling brought a “power dome” hood and a bolder grille stamped with a Super Duty logo and an oversized Ford oval badge. Buyers have the choice of an extended cab (Super Cab) with a 6.75- or 8-foot box and a crew cab with four conventional doors and a 6.75- or 8-foot box. Dual-rear-wheel models are available with the 8-foot box. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard trailer hitch receiver\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- and 20-inch rims available\nOptional PowerScope towing mirrors\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional tubular side steps or running boards\nOptional  spray-in bedliner\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty borrows seats from the F-150, and offers a three-place front bench seat or front bucket seats. The bench seat is split 40/20/40, and a lockable under-seat center storage compartment is optional. A wide center console is available on models with front buckets and includes a bin large enough to hold a laptop computer. On the Lariat, heated and cooled front seats with a memory feature for the power driver’s seat are optional. Crew cab models have a three-place rear bench seat that flips up to reveal a flat cargo floor. An available 4.2-inch LCD screen in the instrument cluster shows fuel economy information and monitors off-road and towing details. Interior features include: \n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional navigation system with SiriusXM Travel Link\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Sync system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 is a single-overhead-camshaft engine that runs on regular gas or E85 ethanol. It produces 385 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe available Power Stroke 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 produces 400 hp and a massive 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm, making it the logical choice for serious towing and hauling. The Power Stroke V-8 burns regular diesel fuel or a blend of up to 20 percent biodiesel.\n\nBoth engines work with a standard six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates Ford’s SelectShift technology, which enables driver-initiated shifts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard electronic locking rear differential\n\nSafety\nSafety features on the Super Duty include:\n\n\nStandard stability system with Roll Stability Control\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nOptional rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nFord’s full-size heavy-duty F-Series Super Duty pickup truck offers a choice of three cabs and two bed lengths. Three versions — the F-250, F-350 and F-450 — are offered. The F-Series Super Duty can carry up to six people in certain versions, and two engines are offered: a 385-horsepower, gas 6.2-liter V-8 and a 450-hp, turbo-diesel 6.7-liter V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 and the Ram 2500 and 3500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nA Lariat Sport Package features 20-inch wheels, and a new Bang & Olufsen premium stereo replaces the Sony premium audio system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include manual air conditioning, 17-inch steel wheels, a vinyl bench seat and an AM/FM stereo. Available features include power windows and locks, cloth seats, cruise control, Sync connectivity, satellite radio, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot, power-adjustable pedals, remote start, navigation, power running boards, a panoramic moonroof, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe 2019 F-Series Super Duty continues to be a strong player with brag-worthy numbers, but if you’re considering this truck, the updated 2020 F-Series Super Duty might also be of interest. Available in fall 2019, the 2020 F-Series Super Duty offers a new gas 7.3-liter V-8 engine along with an available 10-speed automatic transmission. Enhancements to the exterior are subtle, with updated grille styling, revised taillights and new wheel designs. Automatic emergency braking joins the 2020 F-Series Super Duty’s list of available safety features, too.",
