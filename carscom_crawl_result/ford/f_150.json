      "expert_review": "The full-size pickup truck has been America’s workhorse for decades.\n\nIt still is. But in recent years, big trucks have become something else: sporty, comfortable, user-friendly vehicles that more and more Americans are using as cars.\n\nTrucks are not just hot these days, they’re sizzling.\n\nThe two best-selling vehicles in the world are the Ford F150 and the GMC/Chevrolet C1500Silverado.\n\nDodge also builds a popular big truck, the Ram D150.\n\nIn effort to find out who makes the best full-size pickup truck, we asked the Big Three to lend us trucks for a couple of weeks.\n\nWe asked for each company’s best-selling models. All three trucks were equipped with an entry-level V-8, automatic transmission, two-wheel drive and a regular bed and cab. We requested the trucks be equipped the way most truck buyers prefer: with air conditioning, an AM/FM radio, a trailer hitch and a few power accessories.\n\nWe didn’t just drive the test trucks around town. We loaded them with heavy cargo and tested their metal, er, mettle. We drove the trucks in the rain and the dirt. We drove them over bad roads, and we listened for wind and road noise. We looked closely at the way the trucks were built and tried out every accessory several times.\n\nYou may be wondering which truck came out on top.\n\nWell, I’m not going to tell you just now. But I will say this: If you are looking for a big truck, you’ll be able to make your choice a bit easier if you define your priorities. Each of the trucks has its unique strong points.\n\nFor instance, the F150 XLT is most like a car. The Dodge has the most power and versatility. The Chevy does everything well, but comes up a bit short on the inside.\n\nBut one thing is certain: In these rotten economic times, buyers are looking for value above all else. I think all three trucks are excellent vehicles that give you your money’s worth – and more.\n\nHere’s how they compare:\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe numbers tell the story here. Dodge’s 5.2-liter V-8 pumps out 230 horsepower. Compare that to the 185 horsepower on tap from 5.0-liter Ford V-8 and the 175 horsepower from Chevy’s 5.0-liter.\n\nNot only was the Ram D150 faster from a start, but when it came to passing slower traffic, the big Dodge moved away easily and aggressively.\n\nWhen loaded with 1,070 pounds of shingles, courtesy of Builders Square in Apopka, the Dodge’s engine got a bit louder, and its performance dropped slightly, but it still was the quickest and beefiest. The Ram’s 50-horsepower advantage was easily felt at the gas pedal.\n\nDon’t get the impression, however, that the Ford and Chevy were slow or unresponsive. Both offered pleasing and very adequate performance, much like a midsize V-6-powered sedan.\n\nEach truck sported a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The Ford and Chevy transmissions shifted exceptionally smoothly. The Dodge transmission worked well but did not offer the same level of refinement.\n\nAlthough the Dodge engine had the most power, the 5.0-liter engine in the Chevy Silverado performed more consistently. Chevy’s V-8 may have ranked last in horsepower, but it was the only engine that could haul the 1,070 pounds without compromising its smoothness and performance.\n\nFord’s V-8 is great, but when loaded with the shingles, the edge came off its performance.\n\nHANDLING\n\nIf someone blindfolded you and gave you a ride in the Ford and the Chevy trucks, it would be hard to tell which you were in. Both offered a smooth and quiet ride.\n\nTheFordand Chevy had a firm but soft suspension. Both suspension systems filtered out much of the jarring, bouncy motion that you may associate with pickup trucks. When a large bump or pothole was hit, the suspension systems absorbed the shock and both trucks dipped gently.\n\nThe Dodge had a more rugged feel to it, one that will likely appeal to those who like a tough, macho-riding truck.\n\nWh nloaded with cargo, the Ford and Chevy remained level but the front end of the Dodge rose several inches. The cargo was put in the same place in each truck – between the wheel wells.\n\nWe were surprised to find the Ford and Chevy rode smoother with the added weight. The same can’t be said for the Ram, which bounced and dipped considerably over big bumps.\n\nBut Dodge won hands down in the braking department. The front disc/rear drum brakes in the Ram felt strong enough to stop a runaway jetliner.\n\nThe brakes in the Ford and Chevy trucks were excellent, too, but they didn’t have the fast, powerful bite of the Dodge’s brakes.\n\nRear anti-lock brakes were standard in all three trucks.\n\nAs for steering, Ford’s F150 was the easiest to turn. If the steering wheel was released after a sharp turn, it would return to center quickly and smoothly. The steering on the Chevy and Dodge was generally good, but not as responsive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Dodge seemed a bit dated in its styling. And there’s a good reason for that: It has been on the market since 1972. For the most part, the only changes have been minor and cosmetic ones.\n\nBut the Dodge that was tested had the best paint job of the three – a smooth and glossy red that contrasted nicely with the chrome bumpers and grille, styled alloy wheels and black body trim.\n\nThe Ram D150 still is a tough-looking truck that conveys the Dodge’s true mission: It was born to work.\n\nOf the three, Ram had the least impressive interior. The cloth-covered bench seat was comfortable, but the dash and the instrument panel – with its round instruments and a push-button, lever-activated air-conditioning system similar to what my parents had in their 1974 Plymouth Duster – seemed old-fashioned.\n\nIn contrast, some parts of the Ram’s interior seemed out of place. For instance, the tilt steering column, with its steering wheel-mounted cruise control is as modern as anything you’ll find. So was the superb AM/FM cassette radio.\n\nOf the three trucks, the Dodge had the most wind noise.\n\nThe Chevy offers a compromise between style and utility – but it doesn’t really work. The thinly-padded four-spoked steering wheel pokes out too far; it’s almost in your lap. The instruments are housed in a huge, square plastic box fastened to the dash. And the air conditioner requires no fewer than seven buttons to operate. Ford gets by with three round easy-to-use knobs.\n\nAnd speaking of air conditioners, Chevy’s fan was noisy. And there’s not a vent that blows air directly on your face.\n\nFord’s F150 had the best interior. It is more than just stylish – it’s classy.\n\nThe analog gauges – housed in a sweeping one-piece dash – are similar to those used in the Taurus and Thunderbird. The overdrive switch is at the end of the stylish black column shifter; the lighted button can be operated by your thumb.\n\nOn the Dodge, the overdrive button is in the dash on a flimsy p lastic panel. The Chevy Silverado doesn’t have an overdrive switch; instead, you have to shift from overdrive to third gear.\n\nFord takes the award for the best seat. The test truck came with a thickly-padded cloth-covered bench that had a big foldaway center armrest.\n\nChevy’s armrest was so small it was almost useless. The Dodge didn’t have one.\n\nThe F150 also came with inflatable lumbar support; the others didn’t.\n\nCupholders popped out of the Chevy’s dash; on the Ford they were in a plastic tray that juts out from the center of the seat. This could be uncomfortable for a middle passenger. The Dodge didn’t have cupholders.\n\nAll three trucks featured removable tailgates. The Dodge’s was the easiest to remove, but it was the heaviest.\n\nThe Dodge and the Chevy offer cargo lights that shine on the pickup bed. The Ford did not.\n\nAND THE WINNER IS . . .\n\nSo here’s the final word: If you are in the market for a truck to use only for work, take a look at theDo ge.\n\nThe Ram D150 is a truck you can fling bricks and heavy equipment into and no t care about scratching the bed. Heck, you may not even bother to wash it regularly.\n\nGo for the Chevy if you need a truck to use for both work and as a second or third car. The Chevy Silverado is somewhat bland inside, and it has a fussy and confusing dash, but it offers reasonable comfort and a great ride.\n\nThe Silverado also has just enough style not to cause raised eyebrows in social situations.\n\nIf you are interested in the Chevy truck, don’t forget to look at the GMC version.\n\n(It should be noted that the Chevy and GMC trucks are not equipped with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails. Those models, which are the focus of safety concerns because of the possibility of fires in side-impact collisions, were discontinued in 1987. Like the Ford and Dodge trucks, the current GMC and Chevy trucks have their fuel tanks mounted inside the frame rails – meaning that they are less likely to rupture in a side-impact collision.)\n\nIf you want a truck to use as a car, look at the F150 XLT. With a smooth aerodynamic grille and plush interior, it is miles ahead of the competition in class and prestige.\n\nYou’re likely to find that sticker prices for all three of these trucks are flexible.",

      "expert_review": "What comes with two sporty, body-hugging bucket seats, a huge, pulse-quickening V-8 and a full gauge package?\n\nWhat has a heavy-duty, high-performance suspension system, fat road-gripping tires and a bright red paint job?\n\nAnd what packs a hearty growl that’s sure to attract the admiring glances of sports-car lovers everywhere?\n\nA Ferrari?\n\nA Corvette?\n\nA Mercedes convertible?\n\nNope.\n\nWhat we’ve got here is the Ford F-150 Lightning, an outlandish, bodacious muscle truck designed to kick up clouds of dust or sprint from stoplight to stoplight.\n\nThe Lightning is a product of Ford’s Special Vehicle Team, a band of enthusiastic company gearheads charged with the responsibility of pinpointing small niches in the market and then developing high-performance, limited-edition vehicles to fill them.\n\nSVT struck first early in 1993 with the Cobra, a 235-horsepower neck-snapping Mustang hot rod.\n\nThen they worked their magic on Ford’s hot-selling F-150 full-size pickup. The 1993 model debuted a few months after the Cobra and is now available as a 1994 model.\n\nYou’ve got to love what SVT spokesman Scott Sweeney says about the Lightning: ”It has a purposely narrow mission – to entertain and enthrall a select group of discriminating drivers. Philosophically, the Lightning is a Mustang GT with a cargo bed instead of a back seat.”\n\nMission accomplished. After a week and 372 highly entertaining miles, I can tell you that the Lightning is not for the timid.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIt’s what’s under the Lightning’s hood that is most noteworthy. Lightning comes with a 240-horsepower, 5.8-liter fuel-injected V-8 that has been outfitted with the special GT40 cylinder heads that Ford used in LeMans racing, said Jim Sawyer of the SVT.\n\nThe racing heads and other engine modifications deliver 40 more horses over the standard 5.8-liter engine. And you can feel it when you touch the acclerator.\n\nNormally, you wouldn’t care what a truck’s 0-to-60 mph time is, but speed is what the Lightning is all about. Officially, Ford claims the Lightning will reach 60 mph in about 7.6 seconds – about as fast the BMW 325i.\n\nThe Lightning’s engine is a beefy, deep-breathing mill that runs smoothly, but not quietly. It isn’t supposed to.\n\nYou can hear it sucking in air, and you can hear a muffled roar from the exhaust pipes – two noises that make the driving the Lightning an exciting, adrenalin-increasing experience.\n\nThe huge 17-inch tires make sure that the engine’s power is transformed into pure acceleration. Floor the Lightning’s accelerator and the tires don’t spin. Instead, you get knocked back in the seat as the truck shoots forward from a stop.\n\nThe only transmission available is a specially calibrated computerized four-speed automatic. This gearbox has been tuned to extract the maximum amount of performance from the engine. The shifts are delayed while the engine revs. Each upward shift is accompanied by a gentle nudge. You want smooth, go buy a Lincoln.\n\nFuel mileage is poor, but you don’t buy a vehicle like this if you care about fluctuations in gas prices.\n\nThe test truck drained both its gas tanks at the rate of just 14 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving.\n\nHANDLING\n\nFor a big truck, the Lightning is amazingly agile and easy to drive.\n\nIts power-assisted steering is the first thing you notice. It has a nicely weighted feel that conveys a precise feeling of control. There’s no play in the steering, and response is sharp, tight and quick.\n\nThe front disc and rear drum power-assisted brakes haul the big truck to a stop with a minimum of fuss.\n\nIf there’s anything that will take getting used to in this high-performance vehicle, it’s the suspension system. Every little bump jars the Lightning. That’s because the suspension is rock hard. In order to make the Lightning handle like a sports car, SVT engineers loweredt e truck’s ride height and added high-performance shock absorbers.\n\nYou can blast through a tight curve at any legal speed and the Lightning’s body will remain straight and poised.\n\nOn bumpy terrain, though, you are thankful for the snug fitting seat belts that hold you in place when the truck bounces.\n\nUnlike other high performance trucks, the Lightning can haul or tow heavy loads.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe high-quality manner in which the F-150 is assembled is one of the key reasons why it has been this nation’s best-selling vehicle for years.\n\nThe dash is very carlike. The analog gauges are easy to read, nicely styled and sensibly arranged along with the rest of the switches and controls.\n\nThe cloth-covered bucket seats, separated by a huge console, are extremely firm, but comfortable. They are outfitted with numerous electric adjustments. If you are tall – say, 6 feet – leg room might be a problem.\n\nThe bucket seats don’t have much travel on their tracks, and pushed back fully, the rears of the seats touch the back of the cab, forcing you to sit in a more upright position than you might like.\n\nIt’s too bad the door-mounted switches for the electric windows and door locks are not lighted. Finding them at night is a bit of a chore.\n\nBut that’s nit-picking. Few vehicles deliver as much fun and utility as the Lightning.\n\nSawyer of the SVT says Ford built about 5,300 Lightnings in 1993. The 1994 models will have a driver’s side air bag.\n\nThat’s makes an already awesome truck that much better.\n\nTruett’s tip: Ford’s F-150 Lightning is the sports car of trucks. It’s an exceptionally fast and fun-to-drive vehicle that handles well. And it is a stellar value.",

      "expert_review": "IT’S WHITE Lightning — a white Ford F-150 pickup that moves with lightning speed and scares the devil out of anyone who gets in its way.\n\nIt’s a big, muscular truck with a 240-horsepower V-8 that’ll thump lesser vehicles. But it’s friendly, until somebody tries to mess with it.\n\nTake some of your District of Columbia pin-stripers, for example. Some of ’em believe their streets are best suited for limos, Volvos, Hondas and BMW automobiles. You put a full-size pickup in front of ’em, and they go ballistic. They gotta get around you, cut in front of you, do silly things like that.\n\nWell, they can pull that kind of stuff with an ordinary pickup. But the F-150 Lightning ain’t ordinary, not even when it’s hauling a load of clothes for Martha’s Table, a District organization dedicated to helping the homeless.\n\nSome folks who saw me with the pickup and its cargo of boxes and plastic bags obviously couldn’t stand the sight. They honked horns, rode my rear bumper and made illegal passes — until Lightning struck. Va-va-voom! Made their hair curl, I tell ya. Made ’em show some respect, which is all most folks want, regardless of whether they’re driving a pickup or reaching out to Martha’s Table for help.\n\nBackground: Trucks — pickups, minivans, full-size vans and sport-utility vehicles — now account for nearly 40 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States. That’s up from 10 percent since 1974.\n\nChrysler Corp.’s introduction of the minivan in 1984 helped spur truck sales. But, truth is, many folks already were moving in that direction, abandoning their family sedans for go-anywhere, haul-anything vehicles.\n\nStands to reason, then, that with all of those different kinds of people wanting trucks, there’d be a bunch of them who’d want a truck that’s different. Hence, the F-150 Lightning, which is not a truck for everybody.\n\nWhat we have here is truck as hot rod, a lovable beastmobile that has been lowered front and rear to improve its cornering ability.\n\nThe thing tracks like a sports car, even with an empty cargo bed, a condition that would make most pickups squiggly in the rear. Add 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels, performance shock absorbers and that galumptious V-8, and you’ve got something that really hauls … fast.\n\nAnyway, the engine is rated 240 horsepower at 4,200 rpm, with torque set at 340 pound-feet at 3,200 rpm.\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission with a shift interlock (to help eliminate inadvertent shifts from park to reverse) is standard, along with improved side-impact barrier protection and rear anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe truck can carry a 745-pound load and can be outfitted to pull a trailer weighing 5,000 pounds.\n\nThe rear-wheel drive Lightning comes in three colors: black, white and red.\n\nComplaints: Something that seems to be inescapable in pickups — night-time, instrument panel glare on the side and rear windows.\n\nPra ise: Overall engineering, construction and presentation. Excellent seating for three, with a center seat that can be folded down and used as a console. But the real deal is that the Lightning is just one hoot of a ride.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Big, fetching rascal with a deep-throated growl. Gets attention.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Yo! Way to go! No complaints here. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: Well, um, ah, um, about 14 miles per gallon, combined city/highway. Fuel capacity is 30 gallons in two tanks. Estimated range is 400 miles on usable volume of regular unleaded.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette. Ford installed. Okay.\n\nPrice: Estimated base price is $21,700. Estimated dealer’s invoice is $19,000. Estimated price as tested is $22,414, including $229 for the optional center seat and a $485 transportation charge. Please note that state prices are preliminary for 1995 and are subject to change.\n\nPurse-str ngs note: Compare with sport versions of Dodge Ram 1500 and Chevrolet/GMC 1500 pickups.",

      "expert_review": "There’s no one single reason why the Ford F-150 has been America’s bestselling pickup truck for as long as it has been. It doesn’t have the poshest interior, smoothest powertrains, craziest features list or best bargain price. Instead, it’s a very well-rounded pickup truck that satisfies buyers over and over again.\n\nRelated: Ford F-150 Adds Features and Tech as Part of 2024 Updates\n\nFor 2024, Ford has given its perennial cash cow what’s called a “mid-cycle refresh,” which is meant to keep things hot and competitive versus the F-150’s rivals: the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra. Some mild styling updates, some new interior bits, a couple of nifty new features meant to make life with the F-150 that much easier, and bam – America’s favorite soldiers on for another few years before its next great rethink and redesign, which likely won’t stray far from the current one.\n\nWhenever a new F-150 arrives, the question is always if Ford went far enough with its update to keep people interested. With the ‘24 update, the answer is simple: It’s more about not fixing what ain’t broken.\n\nDid They Even Change the Styling?\n\nYou’d be forgiven for not noticing the styling changes to the ‘24 F-150; they’re so small as to be largely invisible even if you parked the ‘23 and ‘24 next to each other. You’d likely also be hard-pressed to determine which one was the newer version. There’s some new headlights, new grilles, new bumpers — the standard things that change whenever a big pickup gets a mid-cycle update — and like most updates like this, they’re just different, not particularly newer.\n\nSuffice it to say that it doesn’t matter; the F-150 looks like an F-150, and the differentiation is more about making the myriad trim levels stand out. The off-road Tremor trim gets a special grille and headlights that look different than the other trims (XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum, Raptor and Raptor R) with their “wraparound” aesthetic. The taillights are subtly different, as well. It all looks Ford-proper, completely uncontroversial and likely the least of the reasons that people will buy an F-150. “Does it look like an F-150? Check.” Moving on.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNew Year, New Tech\n\nOne new-for-2024 feature that is sure to please F-150 owners is the Pro Access Tailgate (every new F-150-related system is seemingly “Pro Something”). Every truckmaker now has its tailgate gimmick (GM started it with its tiered-opening gate; Ram followed up with a vertically split tailgate), and Ford’s is to put a door in the middle of the tailgate. It still opens conventionally if you want it to, but if you have something in the bed that you want to get to without having to reach over the lowered tailgate to get it, the new door in the middle opens up to 100 degrees, and also has detents at 37 and 70 degrees. That’s useful for when you’re opening the door while you’re hitched to a trailer; stopping at the 37-degree detent lets you access the bed without risking banging the tailgate on your trailer. Useful, indeed.\n\nThe other big news for ‘24 is the expanded availability of Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system. Previously only available on the top Limited trim (which no longer exists for ‘24, by the way; Platinum is now the top model), BlueCruise can be had on the XLT trim and up. I tested the latest version in a Lariat, cruising along Interstate 10 in Palm Springs, Calif., at 70 mph without a hiccup or hitch. The best thing one can say about any hands-free driving system is that it works without issue and doesn’t cause any puckering, panicky moments. BlueCruise’s one-button operation is simple to activate, and the new features for 2024 in BlueCruise 1.2 that bring automated lane changes and in-lane repositioning also work as advertised. BlueCruise still can’t operate while towing a trailer, however, something that GM’s Super Cruise can do, so there’s still some room for more functionality in order to keep up with the neighbors. But if you’re not pulling a trailer and you’re just commuting down a busy highway, BlueCruise is lovely.\n\nThe third big bit of news for ‘24 is the addition of Ford’s Pro Trailer Hitch Assist technology that debuted on the 2023 Ford Super Duty pickup. With a little bit of setup (attaching some visual marker stickers to a trailer’s hitch), the truck’s cameras and onboard artificial intelligence software work with the rest of the truck’s systems to automatically line up and back up the pickup directly to the trailer coupler. It makes hitching up a trailer a one-person affair — and easier than ever. The Ford event where I drove the F-150 didn’t include any towing or a demonstration of the system, however, so we can only attest to its seemingly miraculous operation from seeing it at work in the Super Duty; if it works as well here as it did there, this thing is what’s known as a “marriage saver.”\n\nDriving the ’24\n\nMy time on-road in the newest F-150 was limited to two variants: a Lariat crew cab with the PowerBoost full-hybrid powertrain, and the Tremor off-road trim with the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. There are plenty of other powertrains offered for the F-150, but there’s one fewer than there was before: The base engine is now the twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6, as the old naturally aspirated 3.3-liter V-6 is gone.\n\nMy time in the PowerBoost model, which combines a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6, an electric motor that works with a small lithium-ion battery pack and a 10-speed automatic transmission, wasn’t any different than the last PowerBoost truck I’d driven. The integration of the electric and gasoline systems is still not terribly smooth or seamless — you always know when one or the other is working, as well as when the powertrain transitions between them. Braking also feels unnaturally strong when you lift off the accelerator, with rather aggressive regenerative braking taking hold before you hit the brake pedal itself. It takes a bit of practice to drive a PowerBoost model smoothly, and in our experience of owning one for years, the advertised fuel economy is hard to achieve.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter, as the real reason to get a PowerBoost hybrid system is for the optional 7.2-kilowatt Pro Power Onboard generator system, which allows you to power a stunning array of electrical accessories. I’ve used the system to power an Airstream trailer, including its air-conditioning units, all night at a winery’s off-grid camping spot. It makes off-grid trailer camping a no-brainer, and it’s probably one of the F-150’s most unique and exceptional features. You can put up with a little powertrain operational weirdness for that level of unrivaled utility.\n\nThe interior isn’t all that different, either, and still slots below the latest Ram 1500 in terms of interior materials quality. There’s a lot of cheap-looking and feeling plastic in the interior, which is fine for a $38,000 pickup but not a $68,000 one. The 12-inch digital gauge cluster is still one of the best, with great visibility and reconfigurability, and the newly standard 12-inch dashboard touchscreen is welcome, as well. Ford offers plenty of features, usability and comfort in the cabin, I just wish it’d up its game when it comes to some of the tactile qualities — especially in high-end trims.\n\nGetting the Tremors\n\nThe other model that gets a little more massaging than the rest of the lineup is the Tremor off-road spec. Available with a standard 5.0-liter V-8 (making 400 horsepower and 410 pounds-feet of torque) or an optional twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 (400 hp and 500 pounds-feet of torque), it’s more of the off-road work truck to the Raptor’s off-road play truck. Featuring a host of off-road upgrades (including Tremor-specific control arms and front knuckles; unique single-tube front and twin-tube rear shocks; an electronic locking rear differential; an optional Torsen limited-slip front differential; 33-inch tires; and Tremor-specific grille, badging and orange accents), it’s an incredibly capable off-road machine.\n\nI experienced it both on-road and off, and its comfort is undeniable. The big 33-inch all-terrain tires soak up pavement imperfections and even mitigate a lot of washboard chatter off-road, but the lack of an adjustable air suspension means your ride height is static, along with your suspension control. When you really get into the rough off-road, as we did on access roads around Johnson Valley, Calif., it will toss you around in the cabin like most off-road trucks do. It feels indestructible, however, and could likely handle far more challenging obstacles than we faced (I never even dropped it into low range in four hours of off-road overlanding). It’s an excellent rival to the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 and Ram 1500 Rebel. Switching the drive mode selector to Off Road mode also brings up the camera views, with the front-facing one useful on steep inclines for seeing where you’re placing your tires. A washer feature for it might be useful, though; it got a bit dusty as the trail wore on.\n\nThe Tremor also features a couple of electronic systems meant for making off-road driving even easier. There’s Trail Turn Assist, which locks the inside rear tire to tighten the turning radius on low-friction (dirt, mud, snow, ice, etc.) surfaces, and the Trail Control with Trail 1-Pedal Drive system (everything off-road-related in an F-150 is evidently a “Trail Something”). Trail Turn Assist can be useful, especially in a truck this large, if you’re out in the woods and are trying to negotiate some tight spaces. Trail Control is a kind of low-speed cruise control for off-road driving, and I’ve yet to really see the point or need for it. The 1-Pedal Drive can be useful if you’re scaling a steep, slippery rock surface and need to stop in the middle of it for some reason (you don’t have to work both pedals), but it seems that these features were added because they could be, not necessarily because customers requested them. I tried all of these systems in my off-road drive of the ‘24 Tremor and honestly didn’t feel like they added to the experience, with the potential exception of Trail Turn Assist in tight woodland environments.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBreaking Down the 2023 Ford F-150’s Towing Capacities\nFord Recalls Over 870,000 F-150 Pickup Trucks for Parking Brake Issue\nGoing to the Dark Side: Ford Introduces 2024 F-150 Lightning Platinum Black Edition\nFord F-150 Lightning Vs.

Ford has dramatically reduced the number of build combinations and stand-alone options for the 2024 model year, instead lumping various options into packages and trim levels. The company says it has reduced ordering complexity by 90% compared with the 2023 model. That means some features are now standard across the lineup, like the 36-gallon fuel tank for gas-only trucks, a Class IV trailer hitch and the 12-inch multimedia touchscreen.\n\nThere are nine trim levels for 2024, starting at $38,765 for the basic F-150 XL (all prices include a whopping destination fee of $1,995), $47,890 for the STX and $49,615 for the XLT, then jumping quite a bit to $66,145 for the off-road Tremor, $67,190 for the Lariat, and $75,730 for either the luxurious Western-themed King Ranch or $75,730 for luxurious urban-themed Platinum. The factory-floor Baja racing-truck-themed Raptor starts at $80,325 for the twin-turbo V-6 model and $112,250 for the supercharged V-8-powered Raptor R. That’s a massive price gap between the lowest and highest variant, but hey, y’all are evidently paying it, as sales continue to be strong.\n\nThe 2024 Ford F-150 is finally in dealer showrooms now following a multimonth delay from the start of production. The new ‘24 F-150 is not all that different from the ‘23 — but then, it didn’t need to be to continue its success. If you liked the ‘23, you’ll like the ‘24.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford F-150?\n\nThe bestselling vehicle in the U.S., the Ford F-150, can be customized in seemingly endless ways and optimized for a wide variety of tasks. There are three available cab styles, three cargo bed lengths and six powertrain options, including a 325-horsepower, twin-turbo V-6; a 430-hp, hybrid V-6; and a 720-hp, supercharged V-8, which is found in the Raptor R. The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately. \n\nProperly equipped, an F-150 can tow or haul with the best of them. The most basic version is a bargain-minded workhorse, while the highest trims have enough power, luxury and tech to make premium-brand vehicles blush. The F-150’s rivals are the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford F-150?\n\nFord treated the F-150 to a mid-cycle refresh for 2024, so there are no major changes to the truck for 2025. Last year’s updates included revised front-end styling, a newly available Pro Access Tailgate with a center section that opens to the side for easier bed access and a more powerful base engine. The F-150 also received a larger 12-inch touchscreen as standard equipment, and the availability of Ford’s BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system was expanded.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Ford F-150?\n\nThe F-150’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 8,200-13,500 pounds, depending on trim and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Ford F-150 Weigh?\n\nThe F-150’s curb weight ranges from 4,391-5,950 pounds, depending on trim and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford F-150 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12-inch touchscreen\nThree-seat regular cab\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nCloth seats\n12-inch digital gauge cluster\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\nWireless device charging\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nBang & Olufsen audio system\nAdaptive cruise control\nHands-free highway driving (BlueCruise)\n360-degree parking camera\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford F-150?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a full-size pickup, the F-150 absolutely deserves a spot on your shopping list. With so many ways to spec this Ford truck, finding your perfect balance of toughness, fuel economy, cabin room, and towing and hauling capability is a cinch — though sifting through this truck’s enormous options sheet takes planning and patience. Raptor and Raptor R variants have incredible power and off-road capability — along with high price tags that reflect those abilities. Thankfully, even at its most basic, the Ford F-150 is still a rock-solid and savvy choice.",

      "expert_review": "A Ford with an attitude.\n\nBetter yet, a Ford truck with an attitude, a Harley-Davidson edition of the full-size Ford F-Series SuperCrew with a 340-h.p., supercharged rendition of Ford’s 5.4-liter V-8.\n\nThe Harley Ford is the third joint venture rendition since the auto and cycle makers teamed up to produce a limited-edition lifestyle vehicle to showcase each other’s talents.\n\nThe first joint-venture machine was a Super Cab in 2000 followed by a SuperCrew in ’01 and an update for ’02.\n\nSuperCrew means it has four swing-out doors for easy entry/exit, while Super Cab came with swing-outs upfront, swing-back access doors in the rear.\n\nWhat sets the Harley apart from a regular F-150, in addition to all the Harley trim, is the supercharged V-8 that delivers 80 more horsepower than the nonboosted 5.4-liter as well as 425 foot-pounds of torque, up from 350 foot-pounds in the regular.\n\nThe Harley Ford steps lively–very lively. It just doesn’t step past the filling station often. With a 12 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g. highway rating you’ll at least be able to show off your Harley Ford to all those Ford Excursion owners parked at the same pumps.\n\nFor a full-size pickup it handles well, thanks to a suspension tuned to complement the power and to the vehicle being lowered by an inch to give it better road stability.\n\nThe Harley contribution comes from flame pinstriping both outside and on the center console inside; and the Harley-Davidson bar and shield embossed on the parking lamp lenses, center wheel caps, quarter panels, tailgate and seat backs. No flames or shields on the cupholders, however. No need to overdo a good thing.\n\nThe Harley Ford also has a novel chrome billet grille, large headlamps, rivet design around the chromed cast aluminum wheels, chrome exhaust tips, quad captain’s chairs with perforated leather, huge front and rear center consoles, brushed stainless steel/rubber pedals and a “spun metal” instrument cluster.\n\nBase price: $35,780, including such goodies as air conditioning, AM/FM stereo, power adjustable pedals, power windows/locks/mirrors/driver’s seat and four-wheel anti-lock brakes.\n\nOur test vehicle added a power moonroof at $810, slide-open rear window at $125, cargo box cage/extender for $195, heated front seats at $245, and six-disc CD changer at $295, all the options available on the machine. Add $740 for freight.\n\nThe Ford/Harley pact also calls for co-branded clothing and accessories.",

      "expert_review": "There are some crazy people at Ford Motor Co. who spend careers trying to figure out how to turn ordinary cars into hot rods and pickups into rockets. They are members of the company’s Special Vehicle Team, and though they labor in a corporate world, they seem remarkably lacking in restraint&#151;at least in terms of any holds on their imagination.\n\nWitness their latest work&#151;a hot-looking, hard-running, neck-snapping special F-150 pickup truck.\n\nIt’s the 2000 F-150 Harley-Davidson, distinguished, among other things, by being the first production vehicle ever built by Ford with 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe idea is to convey bigness, power, muscle, grip&#151;a theme reinforced by the truck’s strategically bulging sheet metal, growling engine and thrummm-thrummm exhaust note.\n\nIts massive wheels are shod with P275/45R20 Goodyear Eagle GT II rubber, which should relieve the minds of customers worried about Firestone truck tires.\n\nClearly, Ford wanted to get this one right. And no wonder. The F-150 Harley-Davidson, the first project to emerge from a five-year joint venture between Ford and the people who make Harley-Davidson motorcycles, is aimed at a very special audience.\n\nThat means it’s no ordinary F-150, which is no ordinary truck even in generic form. For nearly 20 years, the F-150 has been America’s best-selling vehicle. The limited-edition F-150 Harley-Davidson, 2,000 copies of which are being made at Ford’s truck plant in Oakville, Ontario, is meant to keep things that way. It’s aimed at biker-truckers, or people who want to be bikers and truckers, or deep-pocket members of the Walter Mitty League.\n\nSuch folks are very concerned with “authenticity,” the look, sound, feel, smell of being real. Ford has gone way out of its way to give them what they want on this one.\n\nThe truck is black inside and out, you know, to give it that “Shut yo’ mouth!” appeal. There are, of course, the classic orange Harley-Davidson pinstripes, with genuine Harley-Davidson insignia strategically placed on outside and interior panels.\n\nThe engine is total kick-butt&#151;Ford Triton V-8 that develops 260 horsepower at 4,500 rpm and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The model I drove came with a short, flare-side pickup bed 6 1/2 feet long.\n\nSupple, black biker leather covers the interior, and somehow, by golly, Ford and Harley-Davidson even found a way to make the stuff smell like a biker’s leather jacket. That’s not exactly the most aromatic thing whiffed by my nose. But it surely smells real.\n\nAh, and there are interior, biker-type pouches here and there. It’s wild!\n\nPut it all together with highly polished wheels and the sweetest Harley-Davidson exhaust note (authentic, remember) you ever heard, and you’ve got a truck that police stopped just to check it out. No joke. The brothers in blue weren’t handing out tickets. They just wanted to check out the ride. That’s community relations.\n\nAnd the ride was something else&#151;smooth, power ful, fast on the highway. The truck remained quite maneuverable in the city, though its low-speed movement there was somewhat ponderous. No matter. It made a wonderful thrummm-thrummm-thrummm noise at idle. I loved that. I really did.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150\n\nComplaints: The Harley-Davidson F-150 is over the top, sort of like a Hell’s Angel toting a cargo bed for eternal punishment. It’s totally in-your-face, which doesn’t go over well with some motorists, who automatically assume that anyone bold or crazy enough to drive a truck like that is up to no good.\n\nPraise: The Harley-Davidson F-150 is over the top, which delights the recalcitrant rebel in me, bringing a smile to my face and a transient sense of power and independence to my being. This is by no means a practical pickup. Any F-150, or one of its myriad rivals, would be better suited for real truck work. This one is sheer fun.\n\nCapacities: It’s a Supe rCab model, which means it seats four adults in comfort, five with a squeeze. Depending on equipment chosen, the Harley-Davidson F-150 can haul a payload of up to 2,893 pounds and pull trailer weight up to 13,800 pounds. The test vehicle came with a 25-gallon fuel tank. Regular unleaded worked fine.\n\nMileage: Not much. Barely 16 miles per gallon on highway runs. Not a Sierra Club candidate.\n\nPrice: Whatever the market can get. This is a specialty truck. Start thinking in the $30,000 range.\n\nPurse-strings note: A very attractive “want” truck surrounded by high-quality competitors that do a good job of meeting “needs” at a lower price. Check out Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram 1500, Toyota Tundra.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford F-150?\n\nAs the bestselling pickup truck in the U.S., there are seemingly endless ways to customize the 2023 Ford F-150 for a wide variety of tasks. There are three cab styles, three cargo-bed lengths and seven powertrains available, including a 250-horsepower diesel V-6; a 430-hp, full-hybrid V-6; and a 700-hp, supercharged V-8 in the new-for-2023 Raptor R. The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately in Cars.com’s Research section. The most basic F-150 is a bargain-minded workhorse, while the highest trims have enough power, luxury and tech to make many premium-brand vehicles blush. The F-150’s rivals are the Chevrolet Silverado 1500,  GMC Sierra 1500, Nissan Titan, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ford F-150?\n\nThe new Rattler trim includes off-road-focused features like underbody skid plates, all-terrain tires, an upgraded suspension, a dual-exhaust system, rock-crawling mode, hill descent control and, of course, Rattler logos inside and out. Also arriving is an over-the-top Raptor R; building upon the already wild foundation provided by the Raptor, the R version features a 700-hp V-8, plus beefed-up driveline components and giant 37-inch tires. There’s also a Heritage Edition appearance package available for the XLT trim level that adds a nostalgic two-tone paint scheme.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ford F-150 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nThree-seat regular cab\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nCloth seats\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nRear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment screen\nWireless device charging\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\n12.0-inch digital gauge cluster\nBang & Olufsen audio system\nLeather seating\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ford F-150?\n\nIf you’re in the market for a full-size pickup, the F-150 absolutely deserves a spot on your shopping list. With so many ways to spec this Ford truck, finding that perfect balance of toughness, fuel economy, cabin room, and towing or hauling capability is a cinch — though sifting through this truck’s enormous options sheet takes planning and patience. Raptor and Raptor R models have incredible power and off-road capability, along with giant price tags that reflect as much. Thankfully, even at its most basic, the Ford F-150 is a savvy, rock-solid choice.",

      "expert_review": "Here in truck country, the brawny Ford F-series pickup is still the unchallenged king of the hill.\n\nAfter a stylish redesign unveiled early this year, the F-series remains the No. 1 vehicle in U.S. sales for the 16th year running, pulling away from its nearest challenger, the Chevrolet/GMC CK pickup.\n\nAnd just a glance at the four-wheel-drive SuperCab F-150 we tried out confirms another superlative.\n\nThis thing’s big. Really big, as in huge. And this is just the half-ton.\n\nDoes this truck need its own area code? If I walk around to the passenger side, should I pack a lunch?\n\nAnd no, I won’t help you move.\n\nDespite its Herculean proportions, this jumbo drives like a charm, accelerating briskly and handling with surprising agility, especially considering the extra weight and complexity of its four-wheel-drive system. Other than the commanding view from the driver’s seat, and some bulkiness in the corners, the F-150 feels not too different from a passenger car.\n\nNot bad for a massive workhorse. No wonder trucks have been stealing the turf from cars in recent years.\n\nThe only time this wide, long, tall behemoth gets in its own way is in crowded parking lots. But this is a big truck for a big country. It’s not some decked-out sport-utility vehicle, and it needs plenty of space.\n\nIf anything, the F-150 looks sharper in the longer SuperCab version, which nicely balances out its sloping noise and provides it with a commanding presence.\n\nThe SuperCab provides the F-150 with much more flexibility than the standard version, with places to stow gear, kids or whatever inside the cab. There’s extra room to stretch out, too.\n\nThese big cabs have become major sales boosters for all pickup manufacturers, and the recent third-door designs from Ford and Chevrolet/GMC make them even easier to justify. Industry observers say the next step are full-on four-door pickups with bigger back seats, furthering the trend of trucks as family vehicles.\n\nThe Ford’s third door, which is on the passenger side, eases entry into the rear seat. And unlike GM’s version, which forces exiting passengers to put their fingers in harm’s way to open the third door, Ford provides an inside handle.\n\nThe F-series re-skin, with its rounded shapes that sparked some controversy early on, looks nothing but good after being out for nearly a year. It’s greeted with nearly universal approval by truck folk, and makes the former look seem drab in comparison.\n\nOf course, the competitors haven’t been standing still. The Chevy/GMC is pretty sharp-looking these days, and the Dodge Ram and it baby brother, the Dakota, have made tremendous sales gains, no doubt partially attributable to their mighty big-rig styling.\n\nUnder its bulbous hood, our tester was supplied with an optional 4.6-liter engine, one of Ford’s new generation of overhead-cam V-8s. While missing some of the initial grunt of the old push rod models, the overhead-cam engine quickly picks up its skirts and hauls its heavy load up to highway speed with remarkable agility.\n\nThe standard 4.2-liter V-6 is pretty beefy, too, and a bit lighter on the gas consumption. Or, if you have some stumps that need pulling (or heavy trailers), you could opt for the 5.4-liter V-8, another overhead-cam design, that produces 235 horsepower at 4,250 rpm or, more significantly, 330 pound-feet of torque at a low down 3,000 rpm.\n\nMost impressive about the big pickup is its overall driveability. The power steering has excellent control and feedback, weighted just about right for real-world driving. The quick reactions of the steering is well-matched by the overall cornering balance and stability.\n\nWith the off-road package in our test truck, the overall bigness also means a serious climb into the cab. Running boards should be standard.\n\nStill ahead of the pack, Ford’s big pickup seems destined to maintain its place as national best seller. Way to go, big guy.\n\n1997 Ford F -150\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, three-door pickup truck, Rear/four- wheel-drive. Base price: $24,190. Price as tested: $28,805. Engine: 4.6-liter V-8, 220 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, 290 pound-feet of torque at 3,250 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 4,500 pounds (approx). Payload: 1,520 pounds. Length: 226 inches. Wheelbase: 138.8 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 14 mpg city, 18 mpg highway. Highs: Head-turning styling. Excellent driveability. Well-executed third door. Lows: High step up with no running board. Mediocre gas mileage.",

      "expert_review": "In no fewer than 17 places, the 2003 Ford F-150 SuperCrew King Ranch edition either says “King Ranch” or has the ranch’s brand visible somewhere inside and outside the truck. From side badges to floor mats to the center of the wheels, you are reminded it’s the flagship Ford pickup.\n\nNot necessary, as two other things reminded us we were driving an F-150 King Ranch: One, the superb leather upholstery featuring hides from the King Ranch in Texas. And two: the fact that the truck costs $35,000, and still doesn’t have four-wheel-drive. You can get four-wheel-drive, but you’ll need to add about $3,000 to the sticker.\n\nPrice is not likely to be a consideration to the King Ranch buyer. Ford struck up a partnership with the 825,000-acre ranch in South Texas – a ranch that is, incidentally, bigger than Rhode Island – in 2000, in time to introduce the first King Ranch model as a 2001. The ranch was founded in 1853 by steamboat captain Richard King, and continues to produce cattle and crops in Texas, and on property the company owns in Florida.\n\nFord wanted to build a very upscale F-150, and King Ranch wanted to enhance its national profile, so the marriage prospers.\n\nThe King Ranch edition takes the already well-equipped Lariat model and adds the unique natural-leather upholstery, captain’s chairs, heated front seats, a center console, an upgraded stereo with six-disc CD changer, fog lights, illuminated running boards and special alloy wheels.\n\nThe 5.4-liter V-8 in our test truck was an $800 option over the standard 4.6-liter V-8; add to that $810 for a power moonroof, $195 for a tubular aluminum flip-over bed extender, $285 for a limited-slip rear axle, $740 for transportation, and – this is neat – $245 for a power sliding rear window, and the $32,375 base price moseys on up to $35,450. If you don’t need four full doors and the big rear seat, you can get King Ranch versions of the SuperCab F-150, which has a smaller back seat and a pair of abbreviated rear doors that open front-to-rear; that version starts at $30,920.\n\nMake no mistake: This is a truck for the ranch owner, not for the cowboy. Quiet, comfortable and sure-footed on the highway, this particular “Oxford White” King Ranch – even if you opt for the four-wheel-drive version – does not like to get dirty. Its mission is to transport four people in – complete abject comfort – just four, not five, – due to the big center console in the middle of the rear seat – and if you want to do more, well, Ford makes trucks for that, just not this one.\n\nIn fact, new for this year are King Ranch versions of the heavy-duty F-250 and F-350 pickups, but those are more likely to go to customers who haul horses, not herd cattle. There is so much thick, creamy leather inside the King Ranch that a glance inside would likely spook the cattle, or, lacking that, a PETA representative – from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nEven so, the test King Ranch pickup was prepared to do some light hauling. The 56½7-and-a-half-foot bed can be lengthened by putting the tailgate down, and flipping over the tubular aluminum bed extender. Or, to use the whole bed, the bed extender can be removed.\n\nThe upshot, then: For touring the King Ranch, the F-150 SuperCrew King Ranch is ideal. For working the King Ranch – well, it’s not so ideal.",

      "expert_review": "If Ford’s off-road 2017 F-150 Raptor has an on-road equivalent, it would be the 2017 Ford Shelby GT350 Mustang. The Raptor has been engineered like a specialty sports car and built with very specific and purposeful parts; it’s not just a shock-absorber-and-wheel package like the bulk of the off-road models.\n\nThe Raptor has a new, higher-output version of Ford’s EcoBoost V-6, a borderline race-truck suspension, strengthened frame and supercar-wide tires with more knobs than a Home Depot. The Raptor is perhaps one of the most singularly focused new trucks. Off-roaders such as the Toyota Tundra TRD Pro and Nissan Titan Pro-4X can do light-duty stuff, and the Ram 2500 Power Wagon is perhaps the Raptor’s closest competitor in terms of go-anywhere capability. Compare the Ford Raptor with its competitors here. We tested all of them in our 2017 Monster Factory Off-Road Challenge.\n\nAvailable in SuperCab extended-cab and SuperCrew crew-cab body styles, the Raptor starts at $50,155 and $53,140, respectively, including destination charges. I tested a Raptor SuperCab totaling $64,845.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nAdjectives like “aggressive” and “menacing” don’t appropriately convey the Raptor’s presence. The 2017’s stance is more like, “Eff you.” Huge, meaty tires fill the fenders like a desert racer and the 6 inches of additional track width compared with its predecessor produces a stance similar to a trophy truck. Darkened Raptor-specific front and rear bumpers provide plenty of approach and departure angle, and the front skid plate is imposing and functional.\n\nThe 17-inch wheels wear BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires spec’d to an ultra-wide 12.4 inches (315/70R17) and terrain-absorbing 34 inches tall. Like the previous Raptor, the optional forged-aluminum wheels are bead-lock ready to operate in single-digit tire pressures for extreme rock crawling. In a traditional wheel/tire combination, air pressure keeps the tire secure to the wheel, but a bead-lock wheel mechanically secures the tire to the wheel by squishing the tire’s mounting surface (the bead) between the wheel and a locking ring. With the Ford Performance bead-lock kit, the tires can be aired down for increased contact patch without risking the tire separating from the wheel.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Raptor is seriously quick. Not only do you get a dedicated off-roader in this package, but the Raptor has acceleration reminiscent of a Ford SVT Lightning or Viper-powered Dodge Ram SRT-10. In the Raptor, a 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 produces 450 horsepower and 510 pounds-feet of torque, impressively harnessed by an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission. The 10-speed unlocks the EcoBoost engine’s full potential. Stab the accelerator from a stop and the Raptor pounces off the line unlike any EcoBoost truck I’ve tested. With its twin tailpipes, this version of the EcoBoost sounds meatier than previous versions, but the interior engine noise is noticeably digitized, augmented through the stereo.\n\nDuring our recent Off-Road Challenge, we clocked zero-to-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and the quarter-mile in 14.2 seconds at 96.6 mph. The closest you’ll get to this kind of acceleration from a new truck is the GM half-ton twins with the optional 6.2-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic, and they’re not very good off-road. Ram’s Power Wagon may have a go-anywhere capability, but its acceleration is poky and there’s no thrill in hitting the accelerator like the Raptor.\n\nOne of the only ways the Ford F-150 Raptor indicates it has 10 gears is the vertical gear readout on the dashboard; otherwise, the transmission feels completely natural. Sometimes the transmission didn’t kick down appropriately to match the acceleration I wanted in Normal driving mode, but in Sport mode, the transmission quickly kicked down from 10th to 4th.\n\nGear ratios are, of course, important in rock crawling and low-speed off-road driving, and the wide range of ratios provides plenty of options to get around obstacles. The Ford Raptor’s aggressive 1st gear (4.70) and 4.10 axle ratio, combined with the transfer case’s low range, let the engine rev high for serious rock-crawler action and wheel control.\n\nWe took the Raptor on the Charouleau Gap off-road trail in Tucson, Ariz., which is geared for Jeeps and not necessarily full-size trucks. The Raptor’s stout gearing and generous suspension travel — 13 inches in the front and 13.9 inches in the rear — let the Raptor slowly crawl onto a rock, articulate over and then gently unload the suspension on the other side. We even descended portions of the trail in low range without touching the brakes by engine braking downhill in 1st or 2nd gear. Other trucks would run away if we let off the brakes on the steep downhill portions; the heavy Power Wagon didn’t have the braking power to descend in confidence like the Raptor.\n\nThe Raptor’s Terrain Management System takes the guesswork out of picking driving mode and transfer case settings. Normal, Weather, Mud and Sand, Baja and Rock Crawl modes configure the truck for specific types of driving. In Baja setting, for example, 4-High is selected, the transmission and stability system have unique programming for desert runs and engine responsiveness is specifically tuned. In other modes, the selector will activate both 4-Low and the electronic locking rear differential to escape traction-limited situations at low speeds. There’s also a new automatic four-wheel-drive setting (4A) in addition to 4-High, 4-Low and 2-High that automatically transfers torque between the front and rear wheels on demand.\n\nIn Baja mode, the Ford Raptor glides over dirt washboard roads at 70 mph like it’s on freshly paved asphalt. The suspension works frantically to conform to the road surface without sending big movements into the cabin; other Off-Road Challenge competitors didn’t have supple enough tires or shock absorbers and felt like the bed wanted to rattle right off the frame on the same roads. The Raptor’s composure and ability to find traction on loose dirt and sand is remarkable in 4WD with the optional front limited-slip differential. Slapping it in two-wheel drive let the Raptor’s back end slide around our makeshift dirt course feeling more like a 5,800-pound Mustang than a full-size pickup truck.\n\nFord says the Raptor weighs 500 pounds less than the previous Raptor, but it ain’t no lightweight, as ours tipped the scales at 5,860 pounds with optional equipment. Still, it’s extremely agile and drives like a much lighter truck. The new Raptor has larger-diameter shock absorbers (going from 2.5 to 3 inches) developed with off-road shock manufacturer Fox.\n\nTake the Ford Raptor out of its element and it’s surprisingly not scary to drive on pavement. A long-travel soft suspension with tires like these has the potential to be disconnected from the road, but the steering remains quick, albeit light and somewhat floaty, and the truck is perfectly drivable in daily duty. Body lean is noticeable, but the Raptor doesn’t feel uncontrollable.\n\nBraking is where the off-road truck has its biggest compromise. The Raptor doesn’t stop with immediacy, and the brake pedal is soft and unresponsive. Braking distances are long — we recorded a 60-mph-to-zero panic braking distance of 151.1 feet, which is more than 10 feet longer than street-oriented F-150s we’ve tested.\n\nInterior\n\nA few interior pieces separate the Raptor from pedestrian Ford F-150s. A contoured steering wheel has a red stripe at the 12 o’clock position for peripheral steering reference, and manual gear changes are handled through magnesium shift paddles mounted to the wheel. The steering wheel has a confident grip and the paddle shifters are easily accessible for quick trail use. Front seats are bolstered for tighter grip, though they’re not a sport seat that will alienate customers like the Mustang’s optional Recaros do.\n\nThe SuperCab doesn’t have a very roomy or usable backseat compared with crew-cab trucks, but I think it’s a fair compromise for the more attractive body style (your opinion may vary). The Ford F-150 Raptor is an off-road sports truck anyway, so like a Porsche 911 or Nissan GT-R, who cares about backseat comfort? If you do, the SuperCrew is available and quite roomy.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nLike other F-150s, the Raptor’s optional Sync 3 puts it above and beyond other multimedia system offerings. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto simplify phone use by mirroring navigation, calls and text messages on the main media touchscreen. Sync 3 has robust application integration with an easy-to-use interface for Spotify and Pandora internet radio, Glympse and more.\n\nBetween the speedometer and tachometer gauges is an 8-inch information display with off-road info showing pitch, steering angle, power distribution and terrain mode.\n\nUnlike the Toyota Tundra TRD Pro, Ford hasn’t limited feature availability on its off-road trim, so all the great class-leading technology of the regular F-150 is available on the Raptor, which helps with everyday ownership. Pro Trailer Backup Assist is available for those who tow with the Raptor, and there’s remote start, LED headlights and a seemingly endless number of charge receptacles: USB, AC and DC — and that’s just the front seats.\n\nCargo & Towing\n\nThe Raptor’s ratings are knocked down to mid-size territory, with the tested SuperCab having a maximum trailer weight rating of 6,000 pounds and the SuperCrew at 8,000 pounds. The calculated payload of our SuperCab was 740 pounds, which is enough for a recreational off-road all-terrain vehicle, but that will also be sapped by any additional cargo or occupants.\n\nThe Ford F-150 Raptor has one cargo box length: 5 feet 5 inches. Our test truck had the optional spray-in bedliner and stowable load ramps. The ramps are a nice feature if any wheeled vehicle will be carried, like a pair of dirt bikes or an ATV. When not in use, the ramps fold up to the side of the carbo box above the wheel tubs and don’t take up too much space. The cargo box also illuminates nicely with optional LED lighting. Like other F-150s, the Raptor has a huge center console with plenty of storage for big items such as a tablet or laptop, and nooks and crannies for phones and other pocket items.\n\nSafety\n\nThe F-150’s top crashworthiness ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also apply to the Raptor, according to an IIHS representative. Available safety features include a 360-degree camera system, blind spot warning, lane departure prevention, automatic high beams and a forward collision warning system that pre-charges the brakes if a likely collision is detected.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nIt’s hard to valuate a truck that’s so unique. There’s honestly nothing out there that combines the Ford Raptor’s acceleration and extreme off-road confidence from the factory. As tested, our SuperCab at $64,845 had desirable features of the F-150 such as Pro Trailer Backup Assist, 360-degree parking camera, lane keep assist and more, plus the kind of off-road prowess at the levels of a specialty model like the GT350 Mustang. Ram’s Power Wagon is similarly all-terrain capable with a standard winch and front and rear locking differentials, but it’s not menacingly fun to drive like the Raptor.\n\nA $65,000 light-duty half ton is a tough bite to swallow, but it’s easy to see where the money went on the F-150 Raptor. Want to save a few bucks? I see no need to buy the cargo box ramps to fit an off-road toy in the cargo box — the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor is the toy.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Ford’s F-150 only continues to get better with every new generation, with the 2021 model featuring a slick hybrid-electric powertrain option and some genuinely useful new tech.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s the leader for a reason — the balance of capability, comfort, reliability and feature content has put it on top. Ford’s fanatical attention to delivering unique, innovative new features that are more useful than gimmicky continue to keep it there.\n\nIt’s a great day for America, everybody, because there’s a new Ford F-150 in town. It isn’t every day that Ford updates its breadwinner, the bestselling vehicle in America, but the 2021 model year is here and with it comes a significantly revised F-Series light-duty pickup truck. Ford has made meaningful updates to the popular truck, adding some new technological innovations that are genuinely useful, not just gimmicky. There’s a new gas-electric hybrid powertrain, an all-new interior, three levels of built-in generator, new exterior styling — lots to talk about, for sure. But have the changes to the Ford F-150 improved it over the past model, made it more competitive versus redesigned trucks from Ram and Chevrolet, and generally been worth the cost and effort? Let’s find out.\n\nRelated: 2021 Ford F-150: America’s Favorite Vehicle Gets an Upgrade\n\nAn All-New, Yet Still Familiar Face\n\nMuch of Ford’s mantra for an F-150 update has always been: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The notable deviation from that happened with the previous generation, when Ford went to an all-aluminum-alloy body and structure on a steel chassis. The aluminum-intensive construction is retained for 2021, but the look has been modified a bit. It isn’t easy to spot, but there are a few cues — most notably in the front end, where the popular C-channel LED running lights now extend down into the front bumper. There are a bunch of new grilles, as well, meant to differentiate between the six different trim levels, but only the most die-hard fans will memorize which grille goes with what trim. The rest of the body is also new even if it doesn’t seem so at first glance: The hood is lower and at a different angle than the outgoing model, the body sides get integrated wheel arch flares, and there are new taillights and tailgate designs. You can still get it in three different cab styles (regular, extended and crew cab) with three bed lengths. The overall look isn’t as dramatic a departure as Chevy saw with its latest Silverado and doesn’t even feel as dramatic as the latest Ram’s update. Instead, Ford keeps the styling much as it has been: attractive, clean, distinctive and freshened just enough to keep customers happily coming back for more.\n\nA Richer Looking Interior\n\nStep inside and you’ll see that Ford has made some meaningful improvements to the F-150’s interior styling. It’s a more dramatic change than the exterior styling and takes a more industrial chic design aesthetic to heart, with simulated-metal trim in some models that looks extraordinarily real. The dash now features a “twin racetrack” design, with one hoop encircling the instrument panel width-wise, and another encompassing the center console and multimedia system. Various trim levels have varying degrees of leather, fabric, metal (both real and fake) and wood, but all of them look considerably upgraded from previous efforts. Of note is the move away from “animal grain” pattern on the dash and doors — no more vinyl simulating the look of skin, which you probably didn’t even realize was a thing until someone pointed it out.\n\nIs the new interior good enough to unseat the Ram 1500 as our benchmark for truck interiors? Almost. The big difference here is that while the F-150 interior looks considerably better, the illusion fades once you start touching and tapping things. The hollow feeling of the previous model continues on in the new interior; Ford hasn’t quite nailed the tactile sensation of a high-quality interior in its pickups. Tap anywhere in a Ram interior and it feels solid, chunky, robust; tap around in the F-150 interior and it feels thin, seamed and snapped together instead of solidly screwed together. It’s a subtle difference, but it does hold the Ford back from stealing the Ram’s top spot.\n\nThere are few complaints about the new interior technology, however, with a beautiful optional digital gauge cluster and massive optional 12-inch touchscreen system, both of which are paragons of clarity and function. The latest Sync 4 multimedia system is yet another improvement on the last one, with big buttons, simplified menus and either a split-screen or full-screen configuration depending on the app. Sync 4 allows you to control a number of functions through the big central screen or through the FordPass mobile app. Of note are Zone Lighting, which allows you to project white light on the ground by any single side of the truck (or all of them), the Pro Power Onboard generator system, and the reconfigurability of both the central screen and the digital gauge cluster. One thing is oddly missing, however — a home button for the Sync system. There isn’t a “main screen” for the multimedia system, a step backward from what most automakers do these days in transitioning in-vehicle systems to look more like personal portable electronics. So in the F-150, you’ll always be switching between screens for various functions instead of having several on a general information menu, an odd omission I suspect Ford will rethink for future updates.\n\nThere are some other neat new features in the interior that show genuine innovation on Ford’s part. The electronically folding shifter that lowers into the console to allow for a flat table to open from the armrest is nifty, and I can see this being used often, from contractors needing a laptop surface to road trippers needing a McDonald’s tray table. The fold-flat seats are another matter: Hold the seatback recline button for a few seconds (after you’ve manually folded up the backseat so it doesn’t interfere), and the front seatbacks go nearly horizontal, with the seat bottoms raising themselves to create a bedlike platform. But they’re not exactly comfortable as a bed, being rather short and firm with no support for your legs. I struggled to find a position on them in which I’d want to nap for any length of time.\n\nThe rest of the cabin is as Ford has always made it: comfortable, spacious, well laid out and full of useful storage, cubbies, bins and lockers. The view out is expansive thanks to the drop-down cutouts in the front windowsills, a low hood and tall windows all around. The seats are comfortable, with plenty of room for five in the crew-cab models I drove. All in all, the interior improvements are both functional and innovative, and will provide actual utility to owners who decide to splurge on the fancier options. \n\nLet’s Talk About That New Hybrid\n\nThere are now six powertrain choices for the F-150, starting with a standard 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6; a 325-hp, turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6; a 250-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6; a 400-hp, 5.0-liter V-8; a 400-hp, turbo 3.5-liter V-6; and the new 430-system-hp, turbo 3.5-liter V-6 hybrid. Driving the traditionally powered F-150s isn’t all that different from driving prior versions as not too much has changed mechanically. The turbocharged V-6 models are quick and powerful; the V-8 has a ton of low-end torque and a surprisingly eager throttle; and the diesel is still smooth and torquey. It’s the hybrid that’s the big news here.\n\n2021 Ford F-150 | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n\nThere have been other hybrid full-size pickups before (GM had trucks with two-mode hybrid drivetrains more than a decade ago), but none quite as well integrated and fully fleshed out as the Ford PowerBoost system. The difference comes in the transmission, which is still a 10-speed automatic like the rest of the F-150 lineup, but with an integrated 47-hp electric motor to boost its performance. There’s also a 1.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery on board, sandwiched between the frame rails below the passenger compartment load floor, that enables the hybrid-powered F-150 to drive in full electric mode at speeds up to 45 mph. On top of all this, the hybrid powertrain comes with the new Pro Power Onboard generator system as standard, with an output of 2.4 kilowatts in base form, upgradeable to a whopping 7.2-kW version for some extra cash. More on that in a minute, though; right now we’re more interested in how the new hybrid powertrain drives.\n\nAnd it must be said, it drives quite well. One thing to keep in mind is that this is not a Toyota- or Honda-style hybrid, where you have a small four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission (or the equivalent, as some will say it’s not technically a transmission, or at least not a CVT in the typical sense). Here, we have a powerful turbo V-6 bolted to a big 10-speed automatic with optional four-wheel drive included, as well. As such, the operation of an F-150 hybrid is not the same kind of super-smooth feel you’d get with a smaller vehicle. There’s noticeable vibration when the engine kicks on and the truck transitions from electric to gasoline propulsion, and the transmission itself does seem to shift quite often. It’s by no means jarring or unpleasant, just a little different from other hybrids I’m familiar with. Power delivery when you want it is plentiful, as the 3.5-liter V-6 was a powerhouse even before it got an electric assist. The most remarkable thing about the hybrid is how eager it is to stay in EV mode when it can — you can trundle down main street at 35 mph in complete silence powered only by electrons and even accelerate (very carefully) in full EV mode. Once you pass 40-45 mph, the gas engine will kick back in. In normal operation, you have to have a very light accelerator foot in order to keep it in electric mode, but it can be done, and the experience is pretty novel. \n\nMore Than Just an Eco Poseur\n\nThe interesting part about the hybrid option is that Ford is not treating it like a lifestyle truck. You can get the hybrid powertrain in any trim level of F-150, from the lowly XL up to the range-topping Limited. That makes it accessible as a work option, especially since it features the integrated Pro Power Onboard generator system. A stand-alone 2.0-kW generator system can be had on any gas-engine-equipped F-150 except the standard 3.3-liter V-6, but the basic hybrid system is a 2.4-kW system that can run a variety of equipment. Use it as a mobile movie theater and run a projector, loudspeakers and a popcorn machine all at the same time, or use it at a job site and run a miter saw, jackhammer or other electric tools out of the two 120-volt outlets in the bed. Or, upgrade to the 7.2-kW system and get a 240-volt, 30-amp circuit that can run the air conditioner on a camper trailer, be used as an emergency power source for home appliances, or on a work site to power a plasma cutter, chop saw, work lights and so much more — all at the same time. It’s all easily controlled through a screen in the multimedia system and can even be run while the truck is being driven, meaning you can recharge batteries for tools or keep the air conditioner running on your camper while you’re driving, letting you arrive at a destination with a chilled camper in the summer. It’s a genuinely useful piece of very well-integrated equipment, and I predict it’s going to be very, very popular.\n\n2021 Ford F-150 | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nSo it’s useful, but how does the hybrid do for gas mileage? The new hybrid is rated at 24 mpg across the board, city/highway/combined, according to the EPA. I can’t make a definitive statement without a much longer drive in one, but the 37 miles of rural straight-line roads I drove returned a trip computer reading that was spot on for that rating: 24.2 mpg. This rivals the official EPA rating for the 2020 F-150 4×4 Power Stroke light-duty diesel of 22 or 24 mpg combined, depending on which trim level you get (ratings for the 2021 diesel are not yet available). The highway rating for the 2020 4×4 diesel is superior — 25 to 28 mpg, again depending on trim. One suspects that an urban environment that has more stop-and-go traffic (where hybrids tend to do their most efficient work) would be more effective than my rural trip, but my careful and calm driving seemed to be the ticket. A conventional 3.5-liter-equipped 2021 F-150 4×4 is rated to get only 20 mpg combined, so it would seem that the benefit of the hybrid powertrain is real, at least from this brief spin.\n\nAnd I’m happy to report that it also tows like a champ. Hybrid-equipped F-150 trucks are rated to have at least a 12,000-pound maximum tow rating according to Ford’s preliminary numbers, and my drive of one through a hilly test track at Ford’s Michigan Proving Grounds dragging a 7,000-pound camper trailer showed that the hybrid-equipped model performs just as well as the normal 3.5-liter EcoBoost truck. Towing up a 5-6% grade from a standstill was a snap, with the truck still providing plenty of acceleration on the grade, even under partial throttle. The big question eventually will be what kind of fuel economy the hybrid powertrain achieves while towing — our experience with the conventional EcoBoost powertrains while towing has shown them to be extremely thirsty when put under a load. A longer test should determine if electrification makes a difference here.\n\n2021 Ford F-150 | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\nMore Features, Still Expensive\n\nFord has added so many new features to the F-150, it’s hard to go through them all. There’s the novel new tailgate with built-in work features like F-clamp affixing pockets, built-in rulers and work surface, a bottle opener, even a stand for personal electronics. There’s the optional electronic Active Drive Assist function that will let you take your hands off the wheel on specific premapped roads and highways, coming later in 2021 (trucks purchased before ADA availability will have the appropriate hardware that can be activated via an over-the-air software update). The truck’s safety game has been upped, too, with automatic emergency braking with precollision and intersection assist, an automatic parking function, adaptive cruise control, automatic lane-centering, automatic evasive steering assist and more. There’s towing technology, too, including Ford’s novel Pro Trailer Backup Assist that lets you steer the truck and trailer with a knob, now featuring Trailer Reverse Guidance that even prompts you which way to turn that knob to go where you want. It starts to seem like gadget overload, but the thing is, all of it is genuinely useful in some way — none of it is gimmicky. \n\nAs before, Ford likes to make an F-150 to fit most budgets, and is offering up six different trim levels and myriad special packages to help you find one. The least expensive offering is the XL, which can be had in a regular-cab, 6.5-foot-bed version for the least expensive price of $30,635 (all prices include a $1,695 destination fee). From there, you get an XLT starting at $36,745, Lariat at $46,890, King Ranch at $58,025, Platinum from $60,805 and the range-topping Limited ringing in at an eye-watering $72,520. These are all base prices of course — add options and the prices easily begin to climb. \n\nYet despite the lofty sticker prices, Ford has no trouble finding buyers for massive numbers of F-150 pickups every year, and for good reason. Few other brands have such an intimate relationship with their customers, engendering fierce loyalty and repaying that loyalty with product improvements specifically aimed at answering owner requests for new and improved functions. In short, Ford listens to its owners and continues to deliver what they want in a truck. The new 2021 F-150 is a testament to that consistency.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Even five model years after its last full redesign, the 2020 Ford F-150 continues to be a well-rounded pickup truck with a configuration for almost every buyer.\n\nVersus the competition: Meaningful updates have kept the F-150 competitive among more recent redesigns from Chevrolet, GMC and Ram. \n\nEditor’s note: Our evaluation is  based on a 2019 Ford-F-150 but covers 2019 and 2020 model years; little of substance has changed for 2020.   \n\nWe’ve driven every version of the Ford F-150, using it to work and play while towing, hauling and driving off-road. Despite not being fully redesigned since the 2015 model year when the F-150 switched to aluminum-alloy body construction, the F-150 placed second in our exhaustive half-ton test after a weeklong evaluation of towing/payload performance and drivability. New engines, a 10-speed automatic transmission and updated features have kept the F-150 from falling too far behind its competition, and it remains a recommendable truck. A light-duty diesel engine recently became an option, and the Limited trim level got the F-150 Raptor’s high-output V-6, while the Raptor also received noteworthy changes. I’ll focus this review primarily on those three topics; you can read our 2018 F-150 review of the 5.0-liter V-8 for drivability impressions with the 10-speed that remain unchanged, and our 2016 F-150 SuperCab twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 review that still has relevant impressions about the well-roundedness of that engine.\n\nRelated: Ford F-150: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nWhat’s New for 2020?\n\nFor 2020, there are no mechanical or interior changes to the F-150, though some features and options have been reconfigured. Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 is now standard on Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited trims, adding blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist and automatic high beams; forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is also part of this grouping and was included standard in all F-150s for 2019. On the off-road F-150 Raptor, the former Raptor Technology Package that included adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and rain-sensing wipers has been discontinued, and those options have been lumped into other packages (mid-grade and luxury).\n\nFord F-150 Limited\nFord F-150 Limited | Cars.com photo by G.R. Whale\n\nThe F-150 Limited’s high-output 3.5-liter, new in 2019, is a powerhouse engine that’s a riot to drive if you have gasoline in your veins — and green in your pocket, considering the $69,430 starting price with destination. For 2019, Ford stuffed the Raptor’s 450-horsepower, 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine into a non-Raptor for the first time, fitting the turbocharged V-6 under the hood of the top Limited trim where it produces 510 pounds-feet of torque. \n\nAs an uplevel engine over the regular 3.5-liter EcoBoost (producing 75 hp and 40 pounds-feet more), the high-output version bridges a content gap, filling the same role as  the GM duo’s 420-hp, 460-pounds-feet-of-torque 6.2-liter V-8. GM makes this V-8 available as an alternative to the 5.3-liter V-8 in the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 at a wider range of trims and pricing, however, starting well into the $40,000 range.\n\nFord F-150 Limited | Cars.com photo by G.R. Whale\n\nFord’s high-output 3.5-liter serves up turbo whistling noises like a big rig and almost drives like a diesel, too, with its generous torque available at low engine speeds; I prodded the accelerator pedal in the Limited more like a sports car than a pickup truck. The 10-speed’s transmission calibration takes advantage of the torque bath down low with short shifts during light throttle that pours on acceleration at low engine and vehicle speeds. \n\nBecause of the Limited’s weight (5,135 pounds with two-wheel drive and 5,414 pounds with four-wheel drive), its payload is shrunken in the quest for luxury and power; at a given gross vehicle weight rating, more curb weight means lower payload capacity. Trim-wide, the F-150 has a maximum payload of 3,270 pounds when properly configured with the 5.0-liter V-8 engine, but the Limited 3.5-liter’s 1,520-pound max payload is the lowest maximum of any of the F-150’s engine offerings, lower even than the mid-size 2019 Ford Ranger’s lowest payload of 1,560 pounds. The Limited’s maximum trailer weight is still respectable, however, at 11,100 pounds with two-wheel drive and 9,300 pounds with four-wheel drive. Note that trailer tongue weight counts toward the Limited’s payload, so at the recommended 10% max tongue weight, you’d have only 420 pounds left to carry people and cargo after 1,100 pounds of tongue weight is applied. \n\nThe Limited really is more about power and luxury than rough ‘n’ tough truck stuff, and power it certainly has in exceeding amounts. But it doesn’t quite hit the mark in luxury compared with the most opulent in the class, the Ram 1500 Limited and Laramie Longhorn, which we named our 2020 Luxury “Car” of the Year. Interior quality is where the F-150 shows its age, with a more mechanical, industrial look and feel than the rich luxurious trimmings of a top-level Ram 1500. Plus, its ride is choppy when the bed is empty compared with a Ram riding on its optional air suspension, and it doesn’t have the well-damped ride quality of the Chevrolet and GMC trucks. The F-150 Limited’s 22-inch wheels and short-sidewall tires don’t do its ride quality any favors, either, and at an as-tested $74,000, the F-150 Limited needs a little more in the luxury department — or a lower asking price.\n\nFord F-150 Raptor\nFord F-150 Raptor | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThere’s simply no parallel to the F-150 Raptor. The Ram 2500 Power Wagon is a workhorse, and the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 and Jeep Gladiator Rubicon have their specialties, but the Raptor pairs go-anywhere capabilities with the playfulness of a Mustang GT (like the Limited, the Raptor’s 450-hp, high-output 3.5-liter is a riot to drive). I was a judge on our sister site PickupTrucks.com’s 2017 Monster Factory Off-Road Challenge, in which the Raptor took the top spot. It has a well-roundedness for high-speed washboard roads as well as slow-speed rock crawling courtesy of a 6-inch-wider track than the F-150, meaty tires, a 4.10 axle ratio, 13 inches of front and 13.9 inches of rear suspension travel, and various selectable driving modes that adjust electronic systems and four-wheel drive to match the terrain. \n\nThe F-150 Raptor only got better in 2019, adding standard electronically adjustable shock absorbers (versus fixed firmness in previous years) that better balance the two extremes of on- and off-road. On-road, body control is more civilized, while off-road, a new Trail Control feature (an off-road, low-speed cruise control) helps with slower-speed driving.   \n\nDriving on-road, the Raptor would previously dive, squat and lean like your grandparents’ Mercury Grand Marquis, but starting in 2019, the ride became flatter, more predictable and a lot more enjoyable as the smart shocks automatically adjust firmness in response to inputs from the road and driver, as well as in selectable driving modes for various terrain. These shocks can now detect when the Raptor is airborne and will ramp up firmness when fully extended to counter bottoming out during landing. \n\nAlso added in 2019 were optional Recaro seats that are now my favorite Recaros in any Ford. They’re snug, have creature comforts, aren’t overly bolstered and are good for varying body types. They hold you in tightly but also provide heated and ventilated functions. Other versions of Recaro seats in Fords (Mustang, Focus, Fiesta) are overly aggressive and get mixed reviews from anyone who isn’t 6 feet tall and 160 pounds.\n\nIf there’s anywhere the Raptor comes up short, it’s with maximum trailering capacities of 6,000 pounds for extended-cab and 8,000 pounds for crew-cab versions, and maximum payloads of 1,000 pounds for the extended cab and 1,200 pounds for the crew cab. This isn’t unheard of with extreme factory off-road trucks like the Power Wagon or Raptor because specialty suspensions with increased articulation — and the weight added by beefier, more durable parts — can diminish traditional truck capabilities.\n\nFord F-150 Power Stroke Diesel\nFord F-150 Lariat Diesel | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOur impressions of the turbo-diesel 3.0-liter in the half-ton F-150, first offered in 2018, are mixed, especially after driving the latest Ram 1500, Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 with their optional small-displacement light-duty diesel engines, which are new alternatives to their three-quarter/one-ton heavy-duty diesel power plants. The F-150’s 3.0-liter Power Stroke makes 250 hp and 440 pounds-feet of torque — turbo-diesel Chevrolets and GMCs generate 277 hp and 460 pounds-feet, and Ram’s diesel puts out 260 hp and 480 pounds-feet. \n\nThe diesel has a rush of torque and requisite diesel rattling noises in the lighter-duty F-150, saving some coin and backaches compared with a Ford Super Duty, though at a fraction of its capability. What’s curious about this offering in a Ford is that the existing lineup of gas EcoBoost engines have many diesel-like driving qualities, including generous amounts of low-end torque, which means the light-duty diesel isn’t a clear choice over a 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine that makes 375 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. A 2020 F-150 XLT diesel extended cab starts at $44,420, while the same truck with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost is $41,610. Though the diesel is more efficient according to EPA figures (24 mpg combined versus 19 mpg), diesel fuel is currently expensive enough compared with regular gas ($1.84  versus $2.52) that it makes the choice cloudy — only $50 in annual savings from a significant 6 mpg combined improvement means cost savings shouldn’t really be a consideration given how expensive it is to option the diesel engine.. The F-150 diesel’s fuel economy is just short of competitors with a maximum combined 24 mpg versus the Ram EcoDiesel’s 26 mpg combined and the Chevrolet Duramax’s best 27 mpg.\n\nWhat the light-duty diesel aims to offer is a rich towing experience with improved fuel economy, though we haven’t been able to give the F-150 Power Stroke an exhaustive towing mileage test yet. We weren’t enamored with the initial towing performance of the diesel 3.0-liter primarily because of transmission tuning with the 10-speed that didn’t downshift enough gears for added oomph when needed, though it did make hauling payload quite easy. \n\nGiven the lack of a clear financial advantage to the diesel engine, you’d either have to rack up a lot of miles to make up the difference in upfront costs, need the available 1,000 miles of maximum fuel range per tankful or really want diesel noises in an F-150 to choose the 3.0-liter Power Stroke over the already potent performance of a 3.5-liter EcoBoost. Though the 3.5-liter EcoBoost is usually a disappointment in towing fuel economy, one recently surprised us by returning higher mileage than four other trucks over the same towing loop. Plus, out of roughly 102,000 new F-150s in Cars.com’s national inventory, only 374 are currently listed as diesels, so finding a 3.5-liter will be easier, too.\n\nF-150 Towing\nFord F-150 Lariat | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe F-150 is rated to tow between 5,000 and 13,200 pounds among its six different engines, all of which require the Max Trailer Tow Package for the highest ratings. The Max Trailer Tow Package includes a 3.55:1 axle ratio, electronically locking rear differential, 36-gallon fuel tank, auxiliary transmission and engine coolers, a Class IV receiver hitch, integrated trailer brake controller and an upgraded front stabilizer bar. \n\nIn a recent towing test, an F-150 Lariat with the 375-hp, 3.5-liter EcoBoost performed well against the Chevrolet Silverado 6.2-liter, GMC Sierra 6.2-liter, Ram 1500 5.7-liter with eTorque and Nissan Titan 5.6-liter. Towing 6,100 pounds from the bumper, the F-150 was deemed the towing champ thanks to the 10-speed automatic transmission and how confidently the truck towed, along with the best towing mirrors and surround-view camera setup. That 10-speed transmission also accounted for the best fuel economy of the group while towing (13.2 mpg), which is an area where the previous EcoBoost V-6 engines struggled in our testing.\n\nHow the F-150 Compares to Chevrolet Silverado, Ram 1500\n\n\nIn our quest to find the best half-ton truck, we compared an F-150 Lariat crew cab with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost to the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 with the 6.2-liter V-8, Nissan Titan with the 5.6-liter V-8 and Ram 1500 with the eTorque 5.7-liter V-8. The F-150 placed second behind the GMC 1500 and ahead of the Ram 1500, performing well in towing, fuel economy and measured acceleration. The F-150 drives like a much smaller truck than competitors, almost SUV-like in its agility and how light it is on its feet with responsive steering that reacts quickly to inputs. It does this with a massive cabin (crew cab) with exceptional room for backseat passengers (and under-seat storage too). \n\nWhere the F-150 struggled in that test was in value as a $60,000 truck that lacked advanced safety features and fell short in interior quality compared with similarly priced competitors. For 2020, the safety features omission is less of an issue because the tested Lariat trim now includes Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 standard with blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and automatic high beams. What remains an issue is interior quality showing age with cheap-looking plastic on the dashboard, doors and steering wheel, especially on $60,000-plus versions. Even so, the F-150 remains competitive and a worthy consideration in almost all versions. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Many New Yorkers snicker at the lack of urbanity present in their fellow countrymen. To them anything outside of metro New York City is one vast farm field filled polyester-clad clods who aren’t smart enough to live in New York.\n\nBut we know better. After all, there’s no one more provincial then a New Yorker. As if to prove it, the latest status symbol among the in-crowd denizens who think they know better is the pickup truck.\n\nYes, that’s right, the pickup truck.\n\nIt’s even more macho then a sport utility and, when it comes to image, that’s what really counts in the Big Apple(aside from boatloads of cash).\n\nA message to these clueless car buyers: This truck has been the best-selling truck in America for two decades and the best-selling vehicle in the world for 15 years. And few iterations are better than the latest edition.\n\nRedesigned for the 1997 model year with an aerodynamic air, this strong-shouldered truck has a sophisticated yet modern look. The doors bow inward, sweeping out at the bottom, and, while the front end isn’t as aggressive as the Dodge Ram, it gains points for a more refined look.\n\nAs with any pickup there are a lot of variations. First, start with the model. F-Series trucks come in 150 and 250 depending on size and grunt power needed. The 150 can tow up to 7,300 pounds, the 250 8,300 pounds. Then, pick a cab: Regular cab, crew cab(big rear seat) or super cab (smaller rear seat). Next comes a cargo box, Styleside (practical) or flareside (less practical, looks cool) with 6.5- or 8-foot beds. Then pick an engine. Engines range from a 4.2-liter 210 horse V6 to a 5.4-liter V8 with 235 horsepower with a stump churning 330 pound-feet of torque. All of this comes as a 4×2 or 4×4 in standard, XL, XLT or Lariet trim levels. Got that?\n\nThe test vehicle was an F150 4×2 Super Cab and styleside bed in XLT trim level and the 5.4-liter engine. Painted Bright Red Metallic, this beautiful truck could be seen for miles and, indeed, drew stares aplenty.\n\nMaybe it was from the quick take-offs. The single-overhead-cam engine has good pulling power despite its OHC design. It’s refined sound lets you know its working, but never too much so. Being a rear-drive pickup with an unloaded bed, it wasn’t too difficult to squeal the all-season tires. The ride was excellent for a pickup, with none of the uncomfortable ride motions one would expect.\n\nDespite its size, the truck never drove as big as it was, feeling almost car-like. There was good road feel through the light power steering. Actually, the interior seemed almost as quiet as some luxury cars. Despite its good handling, the tail of this truck will slide easily in inclement weather. Take it easy, or order the 4×4 version.\n\nThe accommodations, while not at the level of the Walfdorf Astoria or the Plaza, were still quite comfy. The seats were a split bench with a wide center armrest/cup holder/storage compartment. The se ats were quite supportive on long drives, with just enough give.\n\nThere’s a short back seat, along with a right-hand-side door for access. Only extremely forgiving adults or small children can ride back there.\n\nUnlike too many instrument panels, this vehicle comes completely equipped, including voltmeter and oil-pressure gauge.\n\nThe dash is rounded, modern and easy to use. The transmission lever is column mounted. The climate controls are three simple rotary knobs that reside just below the very good stereo.\n\nBelow that is an auxiliary power outlet and cup holders.\n\nEveryone thinks about safety, and Ford has thought about it, too. There are rear anti-lock brakes and dual air-bags standard. The passenger side air-bag can be switched off if a child seat is installed, and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes are optional.\n\nBut unlike New Yorkers, who are only now discovering the joys of this vehicle, real Americans have known about the goodness of this truck for years\n\nNow that those Big Apple residents know about it, the price will probably go up.\n\nGet yours now.\n\n1998 Ford F-150 4×2 Super Cab Standard: 4.2-litre SOHC V-6, 5-speed manual transmission, P235/70R16 tires, dual airbags, rear anti-lock brakes, third passenger-side door, power windows and locks, split rear seat, auxiliary power point, dual cupholders, trailer tow wiring, removable lockable tailgate, front and rear chrome bumpers. Options: Preferred Equipment Package 507A (cruise control, tilt steering wheel, air-conditioning, AM/FM/Cassette Stereo with clock), 4.6-litre SOHC V-8, 4-speed automatic transmission, P255/70R16 tires, floor mats, 6,000 GVWR Package, power chrome mirrors, cast aluminum wheels, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, keyless entry.

      "expert_review": "Pickup trucks are selling so fast you’d think half the country is in the home remodeling business.\n\nRoughly half of all vehicles sold are trucks, and last year Ford’s F-series racked up more than 836,000 sales, making it once again the best-selling vehicle in the country.\n\nMost trucks fall into the “personal use” category, where their beds haul little or nothing most of the time. With the accouterments of a passenger car, a ride soft enough to be tolerable on a daily basis and extended cabs with back doors and nearly full size back seats, it’s not surprising that pickup trucks have become the epitome of a “personal” vehicle.\n\nIt was with these things in mind that I approached Ford’s F-150 SuperCab as it came into our household for a weekly test drive. The two-wheel-drive test vehicle was typical of a truck sold for general city driving, including the soft tonneau cover over the bed (a $200 option) to smooth up its looks.\n\nThe standard engine for the F-150 is a 4.2-liter V6, but there are two single-overhead-cam (SOHC) V8s available: a 4.6-liter and a 5.4-liter. The 5.4 got a substantial tweak in power and torque for 1999, and our test truck was so equipped. Horsepower is now 260 and torque an impressive 345 ft.lbs. These changes improve acceleration as well as trailer towing.\n\nBoth V8 engines are as smooth as those found in the Crown Victoria or Lincoln Town Car. Ditto for the shifting of the automatic transmission.\n\nThe 5.4-liter engine made our test truck feel really frisky most of the time, and it was possible to squeal the tires with very little effort. This same willingness to leap away from stop signs resulted in a fair amount of skittishness in the rain, however. Come wintertime, it would be wise to load up the bed for better traction. It’s too bad the same kind of traction control found on cars is not offered on two-wheel-drive trucks. Probably will be one day.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock brakes are a $300 option, but special package discounts on our test vehicle meant that anti-lock was essentially a no-cost item.\n\nThe F-150’s instrument panel is almost as curvaceous as the outside. Gauges are black with white numbers. At night, they glow light green and the needles are pink, which is easy on the eyes. Controls for the radio and climate control are grouped together in a pod that is angled slightly toward the driver. Two large cupholders pull out from the bottom of the dash, and a key-operated switch turns off the passenger-side airbag.\n\nThe test truck also had a cloth-covered, split bench front seat with a large center armrest.\n\nHardcore truck types may think the F-150’s rounded styling is too much like a car, but I like it. The soft curves, sloping windshield and rounded front bumper give it a well-integrated look that I find appealing, especially in the SuperCab version.\n\nAnd speaking of SuperCab, four doors are now standard so the back seat can be accessed from either side . This is an exceptionally useful feature, despite the fact that folks unfamiliar with the current state of the truck art might think four doors is excessive. In fact, while driving the test truck I got into quite a discussion with two people who thought the proliferation of truck doors was excessive. However, after even the shortest time with a truck, being able to get things into and out of the back seat from either side is tremendously handy.\n\nThe Ford’s back seat is big enough for adults, although the legroom is a tad crowded. The 60/40, split-folding bottom cushion allows one or both sides to be folded forward, creating a hard, flat load floor for carrying luggage or groceries. I think a bicycle might even fit there in a pinch, which would keep it out of the weather and protect it from theft.\n\nTrucks continue to gain in popularity because they are practical alternatives to cars as well as a personal statement. With four doors, a usable back seat and carlike amenities, t’s no wonder they sell so well.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the F-150 SuperCab is $21,605. Options on the test vehicle consisted of the 5.4-liter V8, automatic transmission, all-season tires, cab steps, sliding rear window, premium AM/FM/CD stereo, power driver’s seat, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, soft tonneau cover, two-tone paint and remote keyless entry.\n\nThe sticker price was $26,265.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call 816-234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The 5.4-liter V8 has muscled up for 1999 and now boasts 260 horsepower, enough to yank this full-size pickup down the road with tire-squealing acceleration. Having rear doors on each side makes the back seat even easier to use.\n\nCounterpoint: Hardcore truck enthusiasts may find the F-150’s styling too soft, too much like a car, but they can’t quibble with how well it works.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.4-liter, V8\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nCONFIGURATION: Rear-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 138.5 inches\n\nGVWR: 6,300 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $21,605\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $26,265\n\nMPG RATING: 13 city, 17 highway",

      "expert_review": "Ford Motor Company’s 2018 Ford F-150 is preparing for an assault from its fiercest rivals, the soon-to-be-redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and Ram 1500. Somewhat out of cycle from its competitors, the F-150 was last fully redesigned for 2015, when it got an aluminum body and steel frame and became one of the most civilized and high-tech trucks around. It also got some unique features, such as adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning system with automatic braking, that other trucks lack. Will the Ford F-150 instantly be outdated as soon as there’s a new Silverado and Ram? Doubtful, given its updates for 2018. \n\nFor 2018, the F-150 gets more power, more torque, more gears and more mpg to better compete with a crop of new trucks on its way — trucks that have undoubtedly benchmarked the impressive F-150. Despite not accelerating as fast as the 6.2-liter-powered Chevrolet or GMC trucks in our previous testing, the Ford F-150 still takes the crown for drivability.\n\nFor this review, I drove a 2018 Ford F-150 Platinum (the second-most-expensive trim level) with the updated 5.0-liter V-8 and its new 10-speed automatic transmission. You can read about the full engine lineup, including a new base 3.3-liter V-6, in our First Drive of the 2018 Ford F-150. Half-ton truck shoppers are no doubt familiar with sticker shock, so we’ll just mention our test truck’s $63,800 price tag and move right along.\n\nUpdated 5.0-Liter V-8\n\nThe 5.0-liter V-8 isn’t the flashiest powertrain option in the F-series lineup (the 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter turbocharged EcoBoost V-6s get that nod). In previous years, the V-8 felt more like a courtesy engine for die-hard V-8 truck buyers. Why? Because it was matched in our acceleration and towing tests by the less-expensive turbo 2.7-liter, and it was easily outperformed by the more fuel-economy-conscious 3.5-L EcoBoost engine.\n\nFor 2018, the 5.0-liter gains a new fuel-injection system with both port and direct fuel injection for 10 more horsepower and 13 more pounds-feet of torque, up to 395 hp and 400 pounds-feet. That extra power and torque, teamed with the 10-speed’s added gears, make the 2018 5.0-liter a more compelling engine option for die-hard V-8 buyers — though if you’re looking for my recommended engine, the turbo 2.7-L V-6 is the jack-of-all-trades that no one should be ashamed to buy, even if it’s missing a few cylinders. But if you must have a V-8, the 2018 F-150’s is better than before.\n\n10-Speed Transmission Is Transformative\n\nThe secret to the V-8’s improvements is primarily the new 10-speed automatic transmission, which uncorks more of the 5.0-liter’s potential in both highway and stop-and-go conditions. The previous F-150 5.0-liter came with only six gears, which didn’t do the high-revving V-8 any favors; it took too long to get the engine into its power-making range. The 10-speed’s aggressive gearing gives the engine many more options (four, to be exact), and the first six gears are shorter than before: 4.7, 2.99, 2.15, 1.77, 1.52 and 1.28:1 versus the six-speed’s 4.17, 2.34, 1.5, 1.14, 0.86 and 0.69:1 gearing. The 10-speed’s 7th gear is a 1:1 ratio, while 8th, 9th and 10th are overdrive gears.\n\nThe result is less falloff in engine speed between gears, plus continuous, smooth pulling power. Programming is exceptionally intuitive, and the transmission downshifts promptly and can jump half its gears if needed. Another editor noted engine lugging at slower speeds as well as some hunting of gears, but an easy way to resolve that is by switching to Sport mode, which hangs on to numerically lower gears and isn’t too aggressive to drive on a daily basis.\n\nFord F-150 buyers also get improved fuel-economy ratings, up an EPA-estimated 1 mpg in all categories with four-wheel drive to 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. With rear-wheel drive, fuel economy is up 2 mpg in the city and 1 mpg both on the highway and overall, at 17/23/19 mpg. On its own, that may not seem significant, but combined with the truck’s significantly improved drivability, it’s a notable benefit.\n\nF-150 as a Luxury Truck\n\nThe four-wheel-drive, V-8 Platinum SuperCrew I drove is on the higher end of the F-150 spectrum. It’s priced at more than $60,000 and is only one slot below the top Limited trim. For 2018, there aren’t many improvements to the cabin, technology or even ride and handling, which we cover in-depth in the 2016 Ford F-150 expert review. The F-150 Platinum remains a luxury truck in the sense that it’s super nice to drive and has interior quality, features and technology that stand out in the segment.\n\nInterior quality is on par with an entry-level BMW sedan, and the ride and handling are unlike any other half-ton truck, with agility and on-road stability reminiscent of a much smaller non-truck; it feels more like an SUV, in fact. The available 360-degree cameras, massaging seats, impressive new B&O Play stereo by Bang & Olufsen and class-exclusive adaptive cruise control — which also works while towing a trailer — seal the deal: The Ford F-150 is more than simply a utility vehicle.\n\nSafety\n\nThe F-150’s crashworthiness ratings are best-in-class. It scored the highest rating in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, but it lacks Top Safety Pick status because of poor headlight performance. The 2018 F-150 model year hadn’t been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nThe F-150 is the only half ton with optional forward pre-collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Others have collision warning but won’t automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision; that could easily change with the next-generation Chevrolet Silverado and Ram 1500, however.\n\nTowing and Payload\n\nWe have yet to subject the 2018 Ford F-150 to a full towing test, but historically, additional gearing has helped improve towing performance, both numerically as well as in seat-of-the-pants comfort thanks to a drivetrain that’s more responsive and an engine in its peak torque range. Maximum towing for 2018 increases to 13,200 pounds when equipped with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine. Maximum payload honors go to the 5.0-liter V-8 at a rated 3,270 pounds. Ford Motor Company’s Pro Trailer Backup Assist remains a unique option that takes the guesswork out of backing up a trailer.  \n\nValue in Its Class\n\nMore than $60,000 is certainly a lot of money to spend on a vehicle often seen as a utilitarian workhorse, but the F-150 Platinum has an interior, feature set and drivability satisfying enough that I didn’t scoff at the price after spending a couple of hundred miles behind the wheel. And you don’t have to spend $60,000 to get a really good F-150, as detailed in our 2016 test of the 2.7-liter mid-trim-level extended-cab XLT: It had four-wheel drive, remote start, an LED-illuminated cargo box, a tailgate step, a trailer brake and a spray-in bedliner for $43,085.\n\nThe F-150 Platinum, however, can take your payload to work, take your kids to school and be taken out for a date night without pause. And for its price, the F-150 offers features and drivability the other half tons don’t — for now, anyway.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Even five model years after its last full redesign, the 2020 Ford F-150 continues to be a well-rounded pickup truck with a configuration for almost every buyer.\n\nVersus the competition: Meaningful updates have kept the F-150 competitive among more recent redesigns from Chevrolet, GMC and Ram. \n\nEditor’s note: Our evaluation is  based on a 2019 Ford-F-150 but covers 2019 and 2020 model years; little of substance has changed for 2020.   \n\nWe’ve driven every version of the Ford F-150, using it to work and play while towing, hauling and driving off-road. Despite not being fully redesigned since the 2015 model year when the F-150 switched to aluminum-alloy body construction, the F-150 placed second in our exhaustive half-ton test after a weeklong evaluation of towing/payload performance and drivability. New engines, a 10-speed automatic transmission and updated features have kept the F-150 from falling too far behind its competition, and it remains a recommendable truck. A light-duty diesel engine recently became an option, and the Limited trim level got the F-150 Raptor’s high-output V-6, while the Raptor also received noteworthy changes. I’ll focus this review primarily on those three topics; you can read our 2018 F-150 review of the 5.0-liter V-8 for drivability impressions with the 10-speed that remain unchanged, and our 2016 F-150 SuperCab twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 review that still has relevant impressions about the well-roundedness of that engine.\n\nRelated: Ford F-150: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nWhat’s New for 2020?\n\nFor 2020, there are no mechanical or interior changes to the F-150, though some features and options have been reconfigured. Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 is now standard on Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited trims, adding blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist and automatic high beams; forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is also part of this grouping and was included standard in all F-150s for 2019. On the off-road F-150 Raptor, the former Raptor Technology Package that included adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and rain-sensing wipers has been discontinued, and those options have been lumped into other packages (mid-grade and luxury).\n\nFord F-150 Limited\nFord F-150 Limited | Cars.com photo by G.R. Whale\n\nThe F-150 Limited’s high-output 3.5-liter, new in 2019, is a powerhouse engine that’s a riot to drive if you have gasoline in your veins — and green in your pocket, considering the $69,430 starting price with destination. For 2019, Ford stuffed the Raptor’s 450-horsepower, 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine into a non-Raptor for the first time, fitting the turbocharged V-6 under the hood of the top Limited trim where it produces 510 pounds-feet of torque. \n\nAs an uplevel engine over the regular 3.5-liter EcoBoost (producing 75 hp and 40 pounds-feet more), the high-output version bridges a content gap, filling the same role as  the GM duo’s 420-hp, 460-pounds-feet-of-torque 6.2-liter V-8. GM makes this V-8 available as an alternative to the 5.3-liter V-8 in the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 at a wider range of trims and pricing, however, starting well into the $40,000 range.\n\nFord F-150 Limited | Cars.com photo by G.R. Whale\n\nFord’s high-output 3.5-liter serves up turbo whistling noises like a big rig and almost drives like a diesel, too, with its generous torque available at low engine speeds; I prodded the accelerator pedal in the Limited more like a sports car than a pickup truck. The 10-speed’s transmission calibration takes advantage of the torque bath down low with short shifts during light throttle that pours on acceleration at low engine and vehicle speeds. \n\nBecause of the Limited’s weight (5,135 pounds with two-wheel drive and 5,414 pounds with four-wheel drive), its payload is shrunken in the quest for luxury and power; at a given gross vehicle weight rating, more curb weight means lower payload capacity. Trim-wide, the F-150 has a maximum payload of 3,270 pounds when properly configured with the 5.0-liter V-8 engine, but the Limited 3.5-liter’s 1,520-pound max payload is the lowest maximum of any of the F-150’s engine offerings, lower even than the mid-size 2019 Ford Ranger’s lowest payload of 1,560 pounds. The Limited’s maximum trailer weight is still respectable, however, at 11,100 pounds with two-wheel drive and 9,300 pounds with four-wheel drive. Note that trailer tongue weight counts toward the Limited’s payload, so at the recommended 10% max tongue weight, you’d have only 420 pounds left to carry people and cargo after 1,100 pounds of tongue weight is applied. \n\nThe Limited really is more about power and luxury than rough ‘n’ tough truck stuff, and power it certainly has in exceeding amounts. But it doesn’t quite hit the mark in luxury compared with the most opulent in the class, the Ram 1500 Limited and Laramie Longhorn, which we named our 2020 Luxury “Car” of the Year. Interior quality is where the F-150 shows its age, with a more mechanical, industrial look and feel than the rich luxurious trimmings of a top-level Ram 1500. Plus, its ride is choppy when the bed is empty compared with a Ram riding on its optional air suspension, and it doesn’t have the well-damped ride quality of the Chevrolet and GMC trucks. The F-150 Limited’s 22-inch wheels and short-sidewall tires don’t do its ride quality any favors, either, and at an as-tested $74,000, the F-150 Limited needs a little more in the luxury department — or a lower asking price.\n\nFord F-150 Raptor\nFord F-150 Raptor | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThere’s simply no parallel to the F-150 Raptor. The Ram 2500 Power Wagon is a workhorse, and the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 and Jeep Gladiator Rubicon have their specialties, but the Raptor pairs go-anywhere capabilities with the playfulness of a Mustang GT (like the Limited, the Raptor’s 450-hp, high-output 3.5-liter is a riot to drive). I was a judge on our sister site PickupTrucks.com’s 2017 Monster Factory Off-Road Challenge, in which the Raptor took the top spot. It has a well-roundedness for high-speed washboard roads as well as slow-speed rock crawling courtesy of a 6-inch-wider track than the F-150, meaty tires, a 4.10 axle ratio, 13 inches of front and 13.9 inches of rear suspension travel, and various selectable driving modes that adjust electronic systems and four-wheel drive to match the terrain. \n\nThe F-150 Raptor only got better in 2019, adding standard electronically adjustable shock absorbers (versus fixed firmness in previous years) that better balance the two extremes of on- and off-road. On-road, body control is more civilized, while off-road, a new Trail Control feature (an off-road, low-speed cruise control) helps with slower-speed driving.   \n\nDriving on-road, the Raptor would previously dive, squat and lean like your grandparents’ Mercury Grand Marquis, but starting in 2019, the ride became flatter, more predictable and a lot more enjoyable as the smart shocks automatically adjust firmness in response to inputs from the road and driver, as well as in selectable driving modes for various terrain. These shocks can now detect when the Raptor is airborne and will ramp up firmness when fully extended to counter bottoming out during landing. \n\nAlso added in 2019 were optional Recaro seats that are now my favorite Recaros in any Ford. They’re snug, have creature comforts, aren’t overly bolstered and are good for varying body types. They hold you in tightly but also provide heated and ventilated functions. Other versions of Recaro seats in Fords (Mustang, Focus, Fiesta) are overly aggressive and get mixed reviews from anyone who isn’t 6 feet tall and 160 pounds.\n\nIf there’s anywhere the Raptor comes up short, it’s with maximum trailering capacities of 6,000 pounds for extended-cab and 8,000 pounds for crew-cab versions, and maximum payloads of 1,000 pounds for the extended cab and 1,200 pounds for the crew cab. This isn’t unheard of with extreme factory off-road trucks like the Power Wagon or Raptor because specialty suspensions with increased articulation — and the weight added by beefier, more durable parts — can diminish traditional truck capabilities.\n\nFord F-150 Power Stroke Diesel\nFord F-150 Lariat Diesel | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOur impressions of the turbo-diesel 3.0-liter in the half-ton F-150, first offered in 2018, are mixed, especially after driving the latest Ram 1500, Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 with their optional small-displacement light-duty diesel engines, which are new alternatives to their three-quarter/one-ton heavy-duty diesel power plants. The F-150’s 3.0-liter Power Stroke makes 250 hp and 440 pounds-feet of torque — turbo-diesel Chevrolets and GMCs generate 277 hp and 460 pounds-feet, and Ram’s diesel puts out 260 hp and 480 pounds-feet. \n\nThe diesel has a rush of torque and requisite diesel rattling noises in the lighter-duty F-150, saving some coin and backaches compared with a Ford Super Duty, though at a fraction of its capability. What’s curious about this offering in a Ford is that the existing lineup of gas EcoBoost engines have many diesel-like driving qualities, including generous amounts of low-end torque, which means the light-duty diesel isn’t a clear choice over a 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine that makes 375 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. A 2020 F-150 XLT diesel extended cab starts at $44,420, while the same truck with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost is $41,610. Though the diesel is more efficient according to EPA figures (24 mpg combined versus 19 mpg), diesel fuel is currently expensive enough compared with regular gas ($1.84  versus $2.52) that it makes the choice cloudy — only $50 in annual savings from a significant 6 mpg combined improvement means cost savings shouldn’t really be a consideration given how expensive it is to option the diesel engine.. The F-150 diesel’s fuel economy is just short of competitors with a maximum combined 24 mpg versus the Ram EcoDiesel’s 26 mpg combined and the Chevrolet Duramax’s best 27 mpg.\n\nWhat the light-duty diesel aims to offer is a rich towing experience with improved fuel economy, though we haven’t been able to give the F-150 Power Stroke an exhaustive towing mileage test yet. We weren’t enamored with the initial towing performance of the diesel 3.0-liter primarily because of transmission tuning with the 10-speed that didn’t downshift enough gears for added oomph when needed, though it did make hauling payload quite easy. \n\nGiven the lack of a clear financial advantage to the diesel engine, you’d either have to rack up a lot of miles to make up the difference in upfront costs, need the available 1,000 miles of maximum fuel range per tankful or really want diesel noises in an F-150 to choose the 3.0-liter Power Stroke over the already potent performance of a 3.5-liter EcoBoost. Though the 3.5-liter EcoBoost is usually a disappointment in towing fuel economy, one recently surprised us by returning higher mileage than four other trucks over the same towing loop. Plus, out of roughly 102,000 new F-150s in Cars.com’s national inventory, only 374 are currently listed as diesels, so finding a 3.5-liter will be easier, too.\n\nF-150 Towing\nFord F-150 Lariat | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe F-150 is rated to tow between 5,000 and 13,200 pounds among its six different engines, all of which require the Max Trailer Tow Package for the highest ratings. The Max Trailer Tow Package includes a 3.55:1 axle ratio, electronically locking rear differential, 36-gallon fuel tank, auxiliary transmission and engine coolers, a Class IV receiver hitch, integrated trailer brake controller and an upgraded front stabilizer bar. \n\nIn a recent towing test, an F-150 Lariat with the 375-hp, 3.5-liter EcoBoost performed well against the Chevrolet Silverado 6.2-liter, GMC Sierra 6.2-liter, Ram 1500 5.7-liter with eTorque and Nissan Titan 5.6-liter. Towing 6,100 pounds from the bumper, the F-150 was deemed the towing champ thanks to the 10-speed automatic transmission and how confidently the truck towed, along with the best towing mirrors and surround-view camera setup. That 10-speed transmission also accounted for the best fuel economy of the group while towing (13.2 mpg), which is an area where the previous EcoBoost V-6 engines struggled in our testing.\n\nHow the F-150 Compares to Chevrolet Silverado, Ram 1500\n\n\nIn our quest to find the best half-ton truck, we compared an F-150 Lariat crew cab with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost to the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 with the 6.2-liter V-8, Nissan Titan with the 5.6-liter V-8 and Ram 1500 with the eTorque 5.7-liter V-8. The F-150 placed second behind the GMC 1500 and ahead of the Ram 1500, performing well in towing, fuel economy and measured acceleration. The F-150 drives like a much smaller truck than competitors, almost SUV-like in its agility and how light it is on its feet with responsive steering that reacts quickly to inputs. It does this with a massive cabin (crew cab) with exceptional room for backseat passengers (and under-seat storage too). \n\nWhere the F-150 struggled in that test was in value as a $60,000 truck that lacked advanced safety features and fell short in interior quality compared with similarly priced competitors. For 2020, the safety features omission is less of an issue because the tested Lariat trim now includes Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 standard with blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and automatic high beams. What remains an issue is interior quality showing age with cheap-looking plastic on the dashboard, doors and steering wheel, especially on $60,000-plus versions. Even so, the F-150 remains competitive and a worthy consideration in almost all versions. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: The F-150 gets some new appearance and utility packages for 2022. The big news is the new electric-powered F-150 Lightning, which should go on sale this spring. A high-performance F-150 Raptor R will come sometime after that, possibly as a 2022 or 2023 model.\n\nPrice changes: Prices for 2022 are up slightly across the lineup from $430 to $1,230, depending on the trim level.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2021 or 2022? Obviously if you want a Raptor R or Lightning, you need to opt for a 2022 (or possibly 2023) model and wait for it. Otherwise, the F-150’s higher-end King Ranch, Platinum and Limited trims are the only ones to get more standard content for the price hikes, so a model-year 2021 version will be cheaper and you won’t miss out on any extras.\n\nFord redesigned its F-150 pickup for 2021 with a new hybrid powertrain as well as a bunch of handy features and new tech that keep it competitive. Cars.com liked it so much, we named it our Best of 2021 vehicle — then bought one. (Follow our journey.) For 2022, the truck carries over with very few changes in equipment along with modest price increases across all trims.\n\nRelated: We Bought a 2021 Ford F-150: See How Much We Paid\n\nAside from the bread-and-butter trim levels, at least one new model will join for 2022 — the electric-powered F-150 Lightning, which should go on sale in spring 2022. A second vehicle, the Raptor R — a high-performance capstone to the off-road-oriented Raptor lineup — is expected to debut in the 2022 calendar year, though Ford hasn’t yet said whether it will be a 2022 or 2023 model.\n\nEquipment\n\nA new color choice joins the F-150 for 2022: Atlas Blue. Other changes for the new model year are limited to appearance and utility packages that are either new to the F-150 or available across trim levels for 2022.\n\nThe STX Black Appearance Package is now optional on XL models with Ford’s 101A equipment group. Also, the XLT Black Appearance Package is now optional on XLT 301A and 302A SuperCab and SuperCrew models. (Ford markets the F-150’s extended and crew cabs as SuperCab and SuperCrew, respectively.) In addition, the Lariat Black Appearance Package is now optional for 502A equipment groups.\n\nA Platinum Black Appearance Package is newly available for F-150 Platinum models, and a Bed Utility Package is included on King Ranch, Platinum and Limited trims and optional on trims below them.\n\nPricing\n\nPrices for 2022 are up slightly across the lineup. For example, the base XL trim in regular cab, rear-wheel-drive format starts at $31,685 — $700 more than the outgoing base model. All prices include destination.\n\nBelow are the starting prices for 2022, each with two-wheel drive, the base cab and the shortest bed available. In parentheses are price increases over the same trim level for 2021. Four-wheel drive is available across the lineup; the Raptor and Tremor models come standard with 4WD.\n\nXL: $31,685 ($700 increase)\nXLT: $38,325 ($1,230 increase)\nLariat: $48,335 ($1,095 increase)\nTremor: $52,430 ($1,230)\nKing Ranch: $58,805 ($430)\nPlatinum: $61,585 ($430)\nRaptor: $67,070 ($1,230)\nLimited: $76,030 ($1,230)\nNew Models Join the Lineup\n\nThe F-150’s lineup is expanding in different directions for 2022 and beyond with the addition of a new Raptor R model as well as the electric-powered F-150 Lightning.\n\nAfter a redesign for 2021, Ford’s off-road-ready monster is adding a new Raptor R model that’s coming sometime in the 2022 calendar year. Details are slim, but Ford said it will feature a V-8 engine. There’s no word yet on pricing either, but expect it to start north of the $67,070 base price of the F-150 Raptor (non-R), which is powered by a turbocharged V-6.\n\nOn the other side is the highly anticipated F-150 Lightning pickup truck, Ford’s latest electric vehicle. Ford estimates the Lightning will put out 563 horsepower and 775 pounds-feet of torque from its dual-motor, 4WD battery-electric powertrain. In terms of range estimates, the automaker is targeting 300 miles of EPA-rated range for the Lightning’s extended-range version and 230 miles for the standard-range version.\n\nFord says the electric truck is moving to the final phase of preproduction testing, and customers can expect deliveries to start this spring. Prices will range from around $40,000 to $90,000 depending on trim level and equipment, before any state or federal tax credits.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nOur 2021 F-150 Had Problems After 9 Days, 242 Miles\nSee the Rust Under Our Brand-New 2021 Ford F-150\nRead More About Our 2021 F-150\nFind your next car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The switch to aluminum sheet metal is most apparent in how the redesigned 2015 Ford F-150 rides and drives like a much smaller, more agile truck than its competitors.\n\nThe 2015 Ford F-150 is a dramatic departure from typical pickup truck construction, relying on the heavy use of lightweight aluminum in the cab and body to decrease weight up to 700 pounds compared with the 2014 F-150. Why do this? Shedding weight is one way to kill two, three or four of those birds with one stone because payload and towing capacities, and acceleration and braking performance all improve by purging pounds. That’s a big rock. The whole truck also includes new features previously unheard of in the pickup segment, from top to bottom.\n\nThis review covers a mix of engines and body configurations augmented by exhaustive testing from Cars.com’s sibling site, PickupTrucks.com, in our 2015 Light-Duty V-8 Challenge featuring the 2015 F-150 with the 5.0-liter V-8, as well as V-6 engine testing in the 2015 Annual Physical. In the Physical, we tested the new and intriguing turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 plus the lineup’s rock-star engine, the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine. Compare the various engines here.\n\nThe Ford F-150 has previously dominated PickupTrucks.com’s light-duty multitruck comparisons, taking the cake in 2013 and 2008, but the segment has changed considerably since then with new engines, transmissions and suspensions from the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram 1500. Compare the F-150 with those trucks, here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe F-150 hides its significant structural reworking with many design similarities to the outgoing F-150. It’s impossible to mistake the F-150 for anything else but a Ford, but the new pickup is fit, trim and more toned than before. The biggest clue that you’re looking at a 2015 are the new headlight and taillight housings with optional LED lighting.\n\nAll of that steel replaced with aluminum equates to a base model Ford F-150 (regular cab, 3.5-liter V-6, rear-wheel drive and 6.5-foot box) weighing a lick more than 4,000 pounds (4,050 pounds), or roughly the same weight as a midsize Ford Edge SUV. The F-150 is also lighter than the competition. Entry-level Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500s are both 4,521 pounds, a base Ram 1500 is 4,705 pounds, a Toyota Tundra is 5,095 pounds and the Nissan Titan weighs in at 5,049 pounds.\n\nThe F-150 SuperCrew XLT we weighed during PickupTrucks.com’s Light-Duty V-8 Challenge tipped the scales at 5,120 pounds, undercutting the Chevrolet Silverado’s 5,620 pounds, the 2015 GMC Sierra’s 5,640 pounds, the Ram 1500’s 5,780 pounds and the Toyota Tundra’s 5,840 pounds. (While the interior features varied, the tested trucks were comparable in terms of cab and bed styles and four-wheel drive.)\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new F-150 is a massive departure not just from how the old truck drove, but also how a pickup truck should ride in general. Even those who choose one as a good old-fashioned workhorse will be surprised by the F-150’s high-quality ride, increased agility and quiet cabin that’s well-isolated from wind and road noise. All of the body and frame stiffening as well as suspension reworking have done wonders for the Ford F-150’s ride, which is spirited and lively without being overly stiff, striking a harmonious balance between road feel and comfort.\n\nThe ride quality is that much more impressive for having stuck with a rear leaf-spring suspension. It can’t beat the Ram’s plush ride quality from the optional air suspension, but the F-150 doesn’t ride like a truck at all. The steering is dialed in, and even the slightest movement translates to a change of direction.\n\nUnder the hood are two new engine options: the standard naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 making 282 horsepower and 253 pounds-feet of torque and the optional 325-hp, 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 making 375 pounds-feet of torque. The 2.7-liter is the most efficient engine and a deal at $795 on XL and XLT trims; it’s standard on the Ford F-150 Lariat. The mini-EcoBoost engine is quick both when the truck is unloaded and while carrying a load. Auto stop-start technology to save fuel at stoplights contributes to an EPA-estimated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive and 18/23/20 mpg with four-wheel drive.\n\nThe 2.7-liter’s fuel economy and quick-responding performance make it an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a jack-of-all-trades engine. While it’s the most-efficient F-150, the 2.7-liter is still short on mileage numbers compared with the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel’s 20/28/23 mpg rating with rear-wheel drive. The 2.7-liter EcoBoost is a heck of a lot quicker than Ram’s baby diesel, however, and posted quicker times in all measured acceleration testing in PickupTrucks.com’s 2015 Annual Physical.\n\nCarried over is the 3.5-liter EcoBoost with the highest towing capabilities in the F-150 lineup, as well as the half-ton segment as a whole, making 365 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. The 5.0-liter V-8 with 385 hp and 387 lb-ft of torque is also carried over and features the highest payload capacity (more details below). All engines pair with a six-speed automatic transmission and offer two selectable driving modes apart from the default: Tow/Haul and Sport. Sport mode is actually entertaining in the EcoBoost F-150s; the transmission holds gears longer to keep engine speeds up, plus quickens shifts and tightens up throttle response.\n\nFuel economy is up across the board, though not by any groundbreaking numbers. A two-wheel-drive 3.5-liter small-displacement EcoBoost goes from 16/22/18 mpg to 17/24/20 mpg, while a 5.0-liter rear-wheel-drive F-150 sees a 1 mpg improvement, going from 15/21/17 mpg to 15/22/18 mpg. The base 3.5-liter is 1 mpg more efficient than the 2014 3.7-liter with 18/25/20 mpg ratings up from 17/23/19 mpg. We hoped to see a little better fuel economy with a claimed 700-pound weight reduction plus the improved aerodynamics.\n\nIn our testing, the 2.7-liter did zero to 60 mph in nearly the same time as the V-8, 6.79 seconds versus 6.78 seconds for the 5.0-liter, and the 3.5-liter EcoBoost walked away from the others in a blisteringly quick 6.22 seconds. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost’s spritely acceleration couldn’t match the 6.2-liter V-8 in the GMC Sierra V-8 with its 5.91 seconds — the Chevrolet and GMC were so fast that I initially thought the equipment was incorrectly calibrated. The 6.2-liter is the larger of two V-8 engines available in the Chevy and GMC.\n\nI can’t wait to see what Ford’s proven engines will do in performance and fuel economy when mated to the upcoming 10-speed automatic transmission. Especially in the V-8 where with the current six-speed automatic’s gearing doesn’t spin it very quickly. The eight-speed in the 6.2-liter-powered Chevrolet and GMC 1500 trucks rockets the heavy rigs from a standstill. Those trucks bested the 5.0-liter, 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engines during our measured acceleration testing, both loaded and unloaded.\n\nInterior\nThe higher-end F-150 trim levels are where the interior steps away from traditional pickup truck fare and truly impresses in a way that’s slightly more understated than, say, the borderline ridiculous Ram Laramie Longhorn. The difference between a loaded Platinum trim and the modestly equipped XLT, for example, is huge.\n\nThe high-end Platinum trim with genuine wood accents, leather, big 8-inch digital gauge cluster display, heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel plus an array of tech features might as well be a completely different truck from the workhorse XLT, the quality of which doesn’t come across as very different from the outgoing Ford F-150. Some of the F-150’s features wouldn’t be unheard of in a luxury car, including the optional multicontour massaging seats.\n\nIn an XLT SuperCab, seating comfort up front is great for the long haul with comfy fabric seats. The SuperCab’s backseat is a little tight for a 6-foot-tall adult. The seating position is upright and the cushioning not very comfortable. The SuperCab’s doors open surprisingly wide to 170 degrees and provide great access to the inside. Underneath the backseat is a nice partition for cargo that keeps loose items from rolling around in the back.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe instrument panel is all new and features an available 8-inch screen for customizing information displays for fuel economy, towing and off-roading. Tire pressure and trailer information are available through the screen, which offers almost an overload of information.\n\nThe top-tier Platinum trim level includes navigation with an improved version of MyFord Touch featuring numerous surrounding dials and buttons to make the system easier to use. While the current MyFord Touch is not as intuitive as the GM and Ram systems, a significantly updated version of MyFord Touch called Sync 3 is coming for 2016 with a promise of easier usability.\n\nCargo & Towing\nA pickup is meant to do work, and our testing revealed that either EcoBoost engine is the way to go for the tow-and-haul crowd. The 5.0-liter V-8 is the meanest sounding of the bunch, but it’s mostly bark and little bite, while the 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engines provide the low-end grunt the V-8 lacks. The turbocharged V-6s pounce off the line while the V-8 takes a while to spin up and get going — the opposite of what many think would happen when comparing a V-8 and turbocharged V-6.\n\nThe Ford F-150 isn’t any less capable of a truck after switching to aluminum construction. The opposite is true, as the increased strength of the steel frame and lighter body have increased the 2015’s maximum towing to as high as 12,200 pounds with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost regular cab, 141.1-inch wheelbase and rear-wheel drive with 3.55 axle ratio. That represents a 900-pound increase in towing compared with the previous best trailer rating of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine. Payload capacity ratings are, at best, 3,300 pounds with a 5.0-liter V-8 in the regular-cab, 141.1-inch wheelbase configuration with rear-wheel drive. The 5.0-liter can tow a maximum of 11,100 pounds with the optional Heavy Duty Payload Package, while the 2.7-liter can tow 8,500 pounds with the EcoBoost V-6 Payload Package; both packages include 3.73 axle ratios.\n\nLoaded with payload, the 2.7-liter EcoBoost lost the least amount of time between loaded and unloaded zero-to-60 times in our testing versus the 5.0-liter. Carrying 1,240 pounds, the 2.7-liter did zero to 60 mph in 7.42 seconds, and the 5.0 did it in 8.08 seconds.\n\nThe F-150’s 5.0-liter and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engines have higher maximum capacities, however, in towing and payload. The 5.0-liter wasn’t the best performer in our Light-Duty V-8 Challenge, coming in fourth behind the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram 1500 when towing 6,700 pounds up the Davis Dam grade in Arizona.\n\nThe 3.5-liter EcoBoost is a much better match to GM’s 6.2-liter and ran up Davis Dam to 60 mph closer, yet still slightly behind, the Chevrolet and GMC: 20.76 seconds in the 3.5-liter EcoBoost versus 19.92 seconds for the Chevrolet and 20.05 seconds for the GMC. With differences this small, no one would blame you for calling it even.\n\nA couple things we observed while towing is that the F-150’s trailer brake controller is not easily accessible. We’ve towed with a number of EcoBoost engines and while they get respectable fuel economy unloaded, hook up a trailer or load up the cargo box and the 3.5- and-2.7-liter lose a lot of their V-6-like fuel economy. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost with the 3.55 axle ratio pulled off 11.1 mpg towing 6,800 pounds while the V-8 with 3.55 axle ratio was 11.0 mpg on the same loop towing 6,700 pounds.\n\nHooking up a trailer is easy with the 360-degree camera in the Platinum, and the available Trailer Tow Package makes hitching up easier with Dynamic Hitch Assist providing onscreen guidelines for the trailer.\n\nThe optional retractable step on the side of the Ford F-150’s cargo box remains a winner, as does the optional retractable tailgate step that’s easier to use for 2015. Cargo box sizes on the XL, XLT and Lariat include a 5.5-, 6.5- or 8-foot bed, while the King Ranch and Platinum are available only with the 5.5- or 6.5-foot boxes. The box can be illuminated with LEDs as an option.\n\nSafety\nThe F-150 SuperCrew body style received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick rating by testing good (on a scale of poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in moderate-overlap front, side, roof-strength and head restraint/seat tests, and most notably in the difficult-to-ace small-overlap front crash test. Not all of the F-150’s cab styles are as crash-resistant in IIHS testing with the extended-cab SuperCab scoring an only marginal rating in the small-overlap front crash test. That excludes it from being called a Top Safety Pick, which requires good or acceptable ratings in small-overlap results.  Structural elements of the SuperCrew differ from the SuperCab, according to IIHS, though the institute says Ford is evaluating possible changes for small-offset performance. No other full-size pickups have gone through the small-overlap front test, and IIHS plans to evaluate more pickups this year.\n\nThe F-150 passed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash-test ratings with flying colors. The 2015 F-150 earned NHTSA’s highest overall rating of five stars in all cab configurations, with five out of five in front and side collisions, and four out of five in the rollover rating. This mirrors the Chevrolet and GMC trucks and is slightly better than the Ram’s overall four-star rating.\n\nNotable safety features include the optional forward collision warning that triggers audio and visual alerts as well as pre-charges the brakes when an emergency stop is needed. It does not automatically apply the brakes as some vehicles do. Blind spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert and a lane keeping system are also available.  A new 360-degree bird’s-eye-view camera is optional and gives a top-down view of the truck through the use of cameras placed around the exterior.\n\nA backup camera is optional on XL, XLT and Lariat trim levels. The optional camera without upgrading to MyFord Touch shows its image on a smaller screen and is hard to view, though a view-change feature shows a closer view of the trailer hitch for easy connecting. See all of the F-150’s safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhile the 2015 Ford F-150’s weight savings are impressive, it didn’t rocket the 5.0-liter-powered F-150 to a win in PickupTrucks.com’s Light-Duty V-8 Challenge. It placed third, in fact, behind the first-place Chevrolet and second-place GMC. The Chevrolet with its powerful 6.2-liter bested the F-150 in measured acceleration, braking and fuel economy scoring that, combined with subjective scoring, created an overall winner. The F-150 earned the highest scores in the subjective evaluations, however, including performance, interior comfort, technology, ride quality, outward visibility and value.\n\nThe 3.5-liter EcoBoost Platinum we tested at the same time for the 2015 Annual Physical would have gotten the F-150 a lot closer to the performance numbers of the GMC, though that truck’s $60,880 price tag (all prices include destination charges) was above the $55,000 price cap for the V-8 Challenge. You read correctly: $60,000 for a light-duty truck. Incentives will help knock out a good chunk of the cost and were up to $7,050 in total savings on certain models at the time this review was written.\n\n2015 F-150 pricing has increased since its debut and an entry-level XL now costs $1,005 more than the outgoing 2014; when it launched the difference was only $395. Pricing increases throughout a model year are not uncommon and in addition to the mechanical redesign the XL has a newly standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel and additional speakers. The XLT, which is $985 more than the 2014 also gets a power tailgate lock and bed organization system.\n\nWhile the expensive Platinum trim can send you into price tag shock, a midtrim-level XLT we tested with the 2.7-liter EcoBoost and four-wheel drive came to $43,085 with remote start, an LED-illuminated cargo box, a tailgate step, a trailer brake and a spray-in bedliner. Not too shabby for some of the F-150’s most notable features.\n\nUpper trim levels see higher price increases. Lariat models are $1,670 more expensive, the King Ranch is $4,240 more expensive and Platinum trucks are $3,680 pricier than 2014. The increase is somewhat justifiable given all the new feature content for 2015 like the LED headlights, remote power locking tailgate, blind spot warning and so on. Read more about what new features come on each trim level here.\n\nIt’s in these upper trim levels where the Ford F-150 brings the wow factor. An F-150 Platinum with 3.5-liter EcoBoost is one of the nicest riding, most well-appointed and capable half-ton trucks out there, but be prepared to shell out serious dollars to get the Ford F-150 that does it all.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Page: 1 | 2 | 3\n\n6.2-liter V-8 ($2,995 more than 3.7-liter V-6)\n\nFord’s 6.2-liter V-8 is the only engine that carries over from 2010, when it was only available with the F-150 SVT Raptor.\n\nThe single-overhead cam engine is rated at a brawny 411 hp and 434 pounds-feet of torque. But compared to the other engines for 2011, it’s a bit of a throwback. It has two valves and two spark plugs per cylinder, a cast-iron engine block and aluminum cylinder heads. It also features a cast-iron crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods and cast-aluminum pistons.\n\nSince it only has a single cam per cylinder bank, instead of Ti-VCT, the 6.2 uses dual-equal variable cam timing, where the intake and exhaust valve opening and closings are phased at the same time, so it’s not quite as efficient as the other engines.\n\nThe only opportunity Ford gave us to drive the 6.2 was in a drag-racing scenario with the F-150 Harley-Davidson truck, where we measured a zero to 60 mph time of 7.15 seconds – three-tenths of a second slower than the EcoBoost-powered F-150 FX2. But the Harley truck was rocking P275/45R22 tires on 22-inch wheels while the EcoBoost rig was shod with smaller P265/60R18 tires on 18-inch wheels.\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 is the only F-150 engine that’s shared with Ford’s F-Series Super Duty pickups. In our experience testing the 6.2 during our recent Heavy-Duty Shootout, we came away impressed with its performance pulling trailers, especially when the engine worked hard.\n\nWe’ve also been impressed with the 6.2-liter V-8 performance in the Raptor.\n\nZero to 30 MPH (SuperCrew): 2.84 seconds\nZero to 60 MPH (SuperCrew): 7.15 seconds\nWhat We Like\nIf it tows in the F-150 like it did in the F-250 we tested in the Heavy-Duty Shootout, this is the engine to order if you’re going to tow heavy trailers frequently\nExcellent zero to 60 mph performance\nWhat We Don’t\nSteep price tag even though it’s a 2-valve, SOHC design\nOnly available for Lariat, Platinum and limited-edition F-150 models\nOther Changes\n\nOther changes that we noted during our 2011 F-150 sampling were the handsome new gauges in the instrument cluster and the availability of the 4.2-inch productivity screen that debuted in F-Series trucks in the 2011 Super Duty. Hands-down, it’s the best pickup truck trip computer, and it’s the benchmark by which all others that follow will be measured. It has a fuel-efficiency monitor, pitch and yaw angles while off-roading and a robust set of towing apps that can store names and notes for up to 20 trailers, and provides a hitch checklist to help ensure you’ve hooked up the trailer properly.\n\nSummary\n\nFord continues to set the pace in half-ton pickups. Chosen as our Best Overall Light-Duty Pickup during the 2008 Light-Duty Shootout, the new powertrain lineup answers nearly every weakness we identified during that test.\n\nWhile traditional truck owners are likely on the fence watching how the V-6 EcoBoost engine performs before picking it to replace their current V-8 truck, technology like this represents the future of light-duty engines. It’s amazing Ford can market a six-cylinder engine with 420 pounds-feet as environmentally friendly. We’re certainly OK with it.\n\nNon-EcoBoost buyers can find an engine to meet their needs, too. Especially when that engine is paired with Ford’s six-speed automatic transmission, which has more utility than any other gearbox available for a half-ton pickup.\n\nAfter driving all four engines, what seemed originally to be a huge gamble on Ford’s part by making all of these changes in a single model year, might just be the safest bet of all.\n\nPage: 1 | 2 | 3\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When the Ford F-150 SVT Raptor was first unveiled in 2008, auto enthusiasts of all stripes were stopped in their tracks by the sheer outrageousness of Ford’s off-road pickup truck. There has never been a factory-offered high-performance car or truck engineered to travel at speeds up to 100 mph in places where little more than rocks and sand are the only sources of traction. After several turns behind the wheel of the 5.4-liter V-8 model, we were shocked and awed by how well the Raptor fulfilled Ford’s go-fast-in-the-dirt and air-catching promises.\n\nBut suddenly, the original Raptor is a base-model truck. A new 6.2-liter V-8 Raptor has arrived with the most powerful engine available in a half-ton pickup, and we’ve just driven it hard in the unforgiving Mojave Desert of Southern California.\n\nPickupTrucks.com reader Matt Davis, who hangs out with the Raptor driving crew at SVTOffRoad.com, picked up his 6.2-liter Raptor last week and was kind enough to let us borrow it for a day. Also driving alongside us, our good friend Sean Holman, tech editor at Four Wheeler Magazine (you can read Sean’s initial opinion of the truck at the Four Wheeler Blog).\n\nMore Power!\nFor years, if there was one gripe that Ford F-150 owners collectively shared, it was the distinct lack of power (and bragging rights) that come with a large-displacement V-8. The all-new 6.2-liter is meant to answer this glaring hole in Ford’s powertrain lineup.\n\nThe single-overhead cam 6.2-liter V-8 is rated at a brawny 411 horsepower and 434 pounds-feet of torque. The fact that it’s making its debut in today’s frugal times is rather odd, like seeing the strongman sideshow freak turn up in a Cirque du Soleil performance. Where Ford’s latest gas and diesel engines are modern marvels that feature direct injection, turbochargers, compacted graphite iron engine blocks and slick tech like twin intake variable cam timing, the 6.2-liter V-8 is a bit of a throwback. It has two valves and two spark plugs per cylinder, a cast-iron engine block and aluminum cylinder heads. It also features a cast-iron crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods and cast-aluminum pistons. “Powered by Ford” is proudly embossed on the valve covers.\n\nIn addition to the Raptor, the 6.2-liter V-8 can also be found bolted under the hood of the new 2011 F-Series Super Duty, where it’s rated a bit lower at 385 hp and 405 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nBefore we made a beeline for the California outback north of Edwards Air Force Base to try out the whole truck, we paid a visit to our friends at K&N Air Filters in Riverside to borrow time on their chassis dynamometer to empirically measure the horsepower and torque curves of the 6.2-liter.\n\nWith the transmission in third gear, maximum torque was measured at 361.64 pounds-feet and horsepower peaked at 344.52 hp. Both measurements were made at the rear wheels instead of at the crank, which is what Ford uses to claim its advertised rating of 411 hp and 434 pounds-feet.\n\nA 15 to 20 percent power loss from the crank to the rear wheels from friction and rotational parasitic forces is a fair number to use, gauging the relative difference between claimed and dynoed numbers. In that context, the power the 6.2-liter V-8 was able to put on the ground was better than we expected. It’s got more horsepower and just a bit less torque at the rear wheels than the legacy 310-hp, 365 pounds-feet 5.4-liter V-8 has at the crank!\n\nUpdate 1: April-28-2010\nWe dynoed the 6.2 Raptor using 87 octane regular unleaded gasoline. The 6.2 Raptor makes 411 peak horsepower at the crank using premium unleaded fuel and 401 peak horsepower burning regular. Torque remains the same with either fuel.\n\nOn the Road\nAfter K&N, the freeways and backroads from Riverside to Mojave gave us plenty of seat time to see how the 6.2-liter Raptor behaved on the road. After all, you don’t need to trailer this desert prerunner from home to OHV park or Baja Mexico.\n\nA spring storm passing through Southern California threw hard rain at us at times, so we were able to drive on asphalt in wet and dry conditions. In both cases, the 6.2-liter Raptor felt very secure and solid on the road despite its tall stance, big 35-inch BF Goodrich tires and long-travel suspension. The ride seemed distinctively better than the 5.4-liter Raptor, though you could feel some chassis float when changing lanes.\n\nPerhaps it’s the extra weight from the larger mill or revised suspension tuning, but road feel was our first confirmation that the extra time Ford has taken to deliver the 6.2-liter Raptor has paid off well.\n\nThe second indicator that the 6.2-liter Raptor is an improved truck came from the noticeable lack of fussiness from the six-speed automatic transmission, which is the same gearbox paired with the 5.4-liter V-8. In past drives, we noted how the 5.4-liter V-8 tended to hunt for gears, looking for the best balance between speed and fuel economy. Our solution to that issue was to use tow/haul mode to hold gears longer before shifting. There’s virtually none of that frequent cog swapping in the 6.2-liter Raptor, which shifted only as needed and used the engine’s larger power band to stay in gear.\n\nWhen it came time to plant the accelerator to pass slower vehicles, the Raptor responded by smoothly dropping a gear and revving up to its peak torque sweet spot that’s available from 3,500-5,700 rpm. But the rush of power wasn’t EcoBoost shove-you-back-in-the-seat-and-keep-shoving strong, like we’ve experienced in Ford’s latest EB-powered vehicles. Opening the Raptor’s throttle produced a confident and steady stream of power instead of urgent torque sent to the rear wheels. Its power nicely patches all the gaps the 5.4-liter has, but not excessively so.\n\nTo find out just how fast the Raptor is on the road, instead of relying on our butt dyno, we made a couple of runs with the truck at Willow Springs Raceway north of Los Angeles. During three passes in a stormy crosswind, we measured a best zero-to-60 mph time of 7.61 seconds, according to instrumented testing using the VBOX we brought along. That’s with the truck’s launch-optimized 4.10 rear axle, though that low final-drive ratio is somewhat negated by the Raptor’s very tall 35-inch tires. It’s 1.2 seconds faster than what we measured in the 5.4-liter V-8 Raptor, and it’s very respectable considering the Raptor ‘s hefty curb weight tips the scales at more than 6,000 pounds.\n\nIn the quarter-mile, we hit 89.04 mph in 15.86 seconds.\n\nAll of the runs were performed in two-wheel drive with off-road mode on and stability control off, so throttle interference from electronic nannies wouldn’t be a problem, though that apparently introduced rear axle wrap and some wheel hop when we went wide-open throttle from a brake-torqued standing start. That’s not surprising, since we’ve experienced similar behavior before in a standard 5.4-liter F-150.\n\nAfter leaving Willow Springs, we pointed the Raptor toward the wide-open high desert near Johannesburg, Calif. It’s where we recently tested a 5.4-liter V-8 Raptor, so we could put the 6.2-liter Raptor on some of the same trails but still try some new ground.\n\nIn the Dirt\nWe turned off the main road into Last Chance Canyon for a quick excursion up a wash that was freshly covered in spots with large rocks that fell from cliffs during the recent rains. Where possible, we squirted up open sandy sections and dodged boulders, getting a feel for the 6.2-liter V-8’s power on loose surfaces. As hoped and expected, the strong engine enabled the Raptor to hunch down in the dirt for traction without feeling or becoming bogged down in excessively silty sections. That same power also allowed us make precise course corrections during rapid turns around water-formed bends in the dry riverbed, which wouldn’t have been possible with the slower and lower power response with the 5.4-liter V-8. Deft punches of the right pedal could be used for maneuvering instead of being power-limited and having to brake around an obstacle, risking getting bogged down.\n\nWe followed several power line roads and dirt bike trails looking for just the right place to jump the Raptor — you are supposed to jump the truck, after all — but we didn’t have much luck this time finding the right rise. We didn’t want to break the truck, either.\n\nWhat we did find were some great straightaways with odd and random mixes of hard-packed dirt, old crumbling asphalt and small to moderately sized whoops that proved to be an excellent refresher of how well the Raptor’s specialized front and rear Fox shocks handle rapidly changing terrain conditions at speeds up to 50 to 60 mph. The 2.5-inch diameter maintenance-free dampers deliver over 11-inches of front and more than 13-inches of aft wheel travel. Three oil gates inside their barrels control the dampening rate as the shock responds to every surface condition the truck encounters, from pothole to mudhole.\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 excelled in these trail situations as well. Faced with the on-the-spot decision to immediately brake and crawl at low speeds or, instead, quickly speed up to leverage the suspension to rapidly cross changing surfaces — like washboards that gave way to wider-spaced dips or whoops that grew deeper troughs — the extra power rapidly pushed the speedometer to the right so we didn’t bounce too hard over stuff that would be tough on the truck and passengers at lower speeds.\n\nWhat also works well with the 6.2-liter V-8 is the Raptor’s specialized off-road mode. Enabled with the push of a button, off-road mode changes the engine’s throttle map to give the Raptor linear throttle response, like a race truck, instead of high power at the beginning and tapered at the end, like a street truck. Off-road mode also changes the transmission’s shift points to hold its gear and not upshift after letting off the throttle at high speeds. It also locks out the sixth-gear overdrive at the top of the transmission to keep the rpm high.\n\nWe also spent some time just running the Raptor hard in a wide open desert expanse, drifting and power sliding on the dirt to get further familiar with the 6.2-liter V-8’s power band without risk of hitting rocks, bushes or an unexpected deep rut. Flatland isn’t part of the Raptor’s native hilly and rutted trail-running habitat but it sure is fun throwing the rig around a field.\n\nAdding It All Up\nBut there’s more to the Raptor we tested than just go-fast antics. In addition to the $3,000 upgrade to the 6.2-liter V-8 over the 5.4-liter Raptor’s $38,020 starting price, this Raptor also came with the Luxury Package ($1,950) with 10-way power leather heated front seats, power adjustable pedals and a Sony audio system; a moonroof ($995); Ford’s Sync entertainment and navigation system ($2,430); a bed extender ($250); tailgate step ($375); and a rearview camera that’s a lifesaver backing up off-road ($450). The grand total was $48,445, including a $975 destination charge. Not included: the $1,075 “digital mud” exterior graphics option, so we could decorate the truck with the real stuff.\n\nAre those luxuries worth it? Maybe not the moonroof, but all of the others make sense if this is your ultimate fantasy pickup that can be used for work and play.\n\nOne disappointing thing we noticed about the 6.2-liter Raptor was its lack of external differentiation from the 5.4-liter version. Both have the same twin exhaust tips and wheels. On the Ford Racing Raptor XT that was shown at SEMA, there was a cool 6.2-liter V-8 badge that clearly identified the powerplant residing in the truck’s engine bay, but on this truck there was nothing. It’s an issue that deserves a fix, even one as simple as a small badge.\n\nThe last item we measured was fuel economy. We tallied it at two points during the trip. The first part combined freeway and country road driving with off-road driving, and it came out to a lowly 10.4 mpg. The second part only examined highway miles, which were better at 14 mpg but certainly nothing to brag about.\n\nThose familiar with the telenovela development history of the 6.2-liter V-8 powertrain — which is too long to get into in this story — know that this engine has been in development since the early part of the last decade. What might have been considered efficient or satisfactory had it arrived around 2006 isn’t necessarily the case today. Yes, it has gobs of power, but even a six-speed transmission isn’t enough bring mileage up to where it should be. That’s the biggest challenge Ford SVT has in front of it with the Raptor because the rest is brilliant.\n\nCompared with the 5.4-liter truck, the 6.2-liter V-8 Raptor is a better balanced package of power and refinement on and off the pavement. There’s no doubt that the 6.2-liter V-8 gives the Raptor the extra capability it’s been demanding. It’s an incredibly good deal for only an extra $3,000.",

      "expert_review": "As a showcase for powertrain innovations, the 2006 F-150 Harley-Davidson breaks new ground with the availability of all-wheel-drive. That’s a first for any Ford pickup and another step in attracting active truckers in regions prone to inclement weather.\n\nBut the seventh edition of the alliance between Ford and Harley doesn’t push the styling envelope. The familiar deep black paint, large chrome wheels, orange graphics and leather/chrome interior trim returns. It’s a comfortable look and one that surely will appeal to Harley faithful. Maybe I’m getting a little jaded by the Harley-Davidson model, but finding aesthetic pleasure in another black-on-black truck is tough, especially when you look back at the surprises the Harley model has offered over the years.\n\nAnother disappointment is the return to the SuperCab configuration. The first H-D model in 2000 was a SuperCab followed by three years of SuperCrew models, and those were among the best-looking of any Harley-themed truck. The 2004 and 2005 models grew to Super Duty size as Ford needed a diversion to introduce the next generation F-150 platform. Ford is selling every SuperCrew it builds, so it stands to reason that the marketing department wants to inject some life in the dwindling SuperCab market by attaching the Harley badge to the fender. Ford, however, didn’t take that chance with the King Ranch edition.\n\nThe 2006 F-150 Harley-Davidson still commands attention even though the smaller configuration may not appeal to owners with families or lots of drinking buddies. The deep, rich black paint looks as glossy as ever and is accented by orange-trimmed-in-blue scallops. Gone are the lovable flames but the bold die-cast fender emblems continue to announce the package with authority.\n\nThe new 22-inch wheels are the highlight of the package. These forged alloy wheels are more contemporary in their styling and retain the 5-spoke tradition of the model. Considerable engineering was needed to adapt the huge wheels to the suspension and chassis.\n\n“Large rims definitely can affect ride characteristics,” explains Gary Braddock, chief designer at Ford Product Design. “Jounce-up and down movement-is something you have to be especially aware of when putting larger rims on a truck. That is why the wheels are forged rather than cast. Forging produces a stronger aluminum, allowing us to use less material in the wheel and retain the strength without adding excess weight.”\n\nAccenting the wheels and providing a little edge to the stance are chrome-trimmed side tubes and a lower, meaner looking chin spoiler.\n\nThe upside to the SuperCab, of course, is the longer bed that can accommodate more cargo. Toting a custom Harley in the bed still requires a lowered tailgate, but there’s additional clearance for longer models. Chrome tie-downs and a rubber mat with the Harley logo accent the bed.\n\nThe interior is dressed in black aniline leather and trimmed with plenty of chrome. The captains chairs up front sports a die-cast Harley logo embedded in the leather. Piano Black surfaces on the center stack and door panels are flanked by logo-patterned graphic treatments. Chromed-ringed gauges and HVAC vents add to the custom accents throughout the interior. For those keeping score, a serialized nickel plate boasts the truck’s production date and number. Power sliding rear window and power adjustable pedals made our truck easier to bond with. Other interior amenities on our test vehicle that were highly appreciated included heated seats, satellite radio, power moonroof and reverse-sensing system.\n\nOur test vehicle had the all-wheel-drive option. In AWD, the system monitors wheel speed and throttle position to determine the amount of power sent to the front wheels. By selecting the locked mode, the truck runs in 4WD full time. The H-D is also available in 2-wheel-drive. Price difference is about $3,500.\n\nIn front of the transfer case is a 4-speed automatic and 5.4-liter V8 engine. Rated at 300 horsepower with 365 lb-ft of peak torque, the powertrain is capable of giving the H-D a towing capacity of 8600 pounds. Payload rating is 1460 pounds. With a curb weight just under 5,700 pounds and 3.73:1 rear gears, the F-150 Harley isn’t exactly a speed demon. Acceleration is adequate but hardly spirited. One certainly longs for previous H-D models that were supercharged and weighed about 700 or 800 pounds less. Engineers did give the engine a meaner exhaust note.\n\nThe sport-tuned suspension is pleasant enough for most driving situations but don’t expect to carve any canyons and keep up with an aging Lightning. The new Ford platform is heavy, regardless of the increased frame stiffness that minimizes shake and shudder. Much of the riding-comfort equation can be attributed to the improved seats and excellent feel of the leather. On the positive side, the truck is very quiet, a compliment often given to the new generation F-150 platform.\n\nLast year PUTC interviewed Willie G. Davidson about the challenges of coming up with new ideas for the Harley-Davidson edition. He praised the teams from Harley and Ford that he works with but never said it was easy. This edition doesn’t have the surprise element of the first edition. The next three years of the SuperCrew Harley models were highlighted by the 2003 anniversary edition (both Harley and Ford celebrated their 100th birthdays). With a supercharged engine and beautiful black/silver two-tone paint job, it was a stunning tribute for both companies. The Super Duty model has morphed into a cross between the Harley and King Ranch and is more of a cosmetic package. There are no performance upgrades with the Super Duty Harley. Hopefully the 2006 H-D is a stepping stone to a more dramatic edition for the future. With the absence of the SVT Lightning, the Harley team has a greater opportunity to take the F-150 to a much higher level than what is available now.",

      "expert_review": "HELL — Interstate 94 is Michigan’s highway to Hell.\n\nHead west from Detroit and it’ll take you through Ann Arbor; hook a right and then cruise north about 20 miles. Off the highway, the smooth meandering roads offer postcard views through rolling hills. Hell, it turns out, is a 166-year-old hamlet, home to a few hundred people, a bar, an ice cream and general stores. It also hosts more cliches than Intercourse, Pa.\n\nIt seemed a fitting destination to test Ford’s new supercharged Harley-Davidson F-150 SuperCrew. The four-door black pickup became Ford’s latest attempt to combine street-riding charms and supercharged power since the automaker discontinued the SVT Lightning in 2004. The 2007 supercharged model is a late addition to Ford’s 2007 pickup lineup, and the 2008 models will hit dealerships in August.\n\nUnlike the Lightning, this supercharged truck packs more punch and includes the chopper king’s seal of approval, as noted by more Harley logos than on a Friday night Royal Oak “RUB” — biker speak for the Rich Urban Biker.\n\nThe purist in me questions whether the 1999 Harley-Ford partnership stays true to pickups and motorcycles. The enthusiast in me says this is a pretty cool truck.\n\nIn the end, the combination works, though the motorcycle maker’s logo may have been slightly overused. It’s everywhere, both front fenders, the tailgate, the wheel caps, and written across both rear quarter panels. Even the bed liner looks like a welcome mat to a Harley store. All that’s missing are a few bumper stickers decrying helmet laws and a T-shirt letting you know, “If you can read this, (someone) fell off.”\n\nUnlike most work trucks, this kind of pickup begets bragging rights, and the Harley Davidson F-150’s bravado is as subtle as straight pipes. It shouts: I love Harley-Davidson and I can afford it.\n\nStarting at $44,635, the supercharged Harley-Davidson certainly is not cheap.\n\nBut if you want to pay for attention, this truck fits the bill.\n\nDevilish good looks\n\nEven in Hell, its monochrome black body and majestic interior says bad boy, without crossing the line and breaking a beer bottle over anyone’s head. It smokes its 22-inch tires faster than the cast of Easy Rider can hotbox a Lucky Strike.\n\nPart outlaw and part poser, it will cruise Woodward Avenue on a Saturday night in style as well as get the wife and kids to the cabin up north in a hurry.\n\nThe truck’s speed starts with the $6,500 optional twin-screw Saleen supercharger Ford bolted to the 5.4-liter V-8.\n\nFord showcased a supercharger in a concept truck last November at the aftermarket trade show SEMA as the F-150 FX2. Eight months later, the concept became a production-ready, lightning-quick pickup with a 450-horsepower engine and devilish good looks.\n\nFloor this truck at a light and listen to it scream in that high-pitched whistle as the inter-cooled supercharger crams each cylinder with more air.\n\nWhile I never loaded up the bed with any weight, the truck handled itself well on the road, a good sign for a truck with more intentions of being seen than being seen working. The only real gig against the powertrain is its four-speed automatic transmission that seemed jarring on fast acceleration. Also, the supercharger and performance tuned suspension and larger tires, limits the truck’s towing abilities, cutting it to 5,000 pounds. (The base model Harley-Davidson F-150 can haul 9,500 pounds.)\n\nPut this truck on a straight and narrow path and it will blister up the competition.\n\nOf course, that comes with a price. The Harley-Davidson sucks down gas as much as it gulps down air. The EPA averages are 13 mpg city and 16 mpg highway. I averaged 14 mpg.\n\nBug-free ride\n\nInside Ford’s ninth Harley model, the love-fest continues. There’s even a small metal plate at the base of the center stack near the gear shifter that gives the truck’s VIN. It’s a personalized plate to let the buyer know he, or the truck, is special. My test vehicle, an engineering prototype lacked an actual serial number, but still looked nice.\n\nThe interior is so much like a Harley, you almost wonder whether you should wear a skull cap and chaps. The instrument panel is patterned after the Harley-Davidson Screaming Eagle’s gauges, with silver faces and orange numbers. “Harley-Davidson” is proudly written across the bottom of the speedometer.\n\nThe leather seats are big and comfortable with enough room for a Fat Boy and the center console between the two passengers is big enough to hold a laptop computer. There are nice nooks and storage crannies that will hold drinks and cell phones.\n\nPiano-black trim tastefully outlines the dashboard’s edges and encases the stereo and cabin controls. Every piece fits together well. Aluminum pedals shine, and the chrome accents around the vents felt well placed and tasteful.\n\nThe second row of the truck fits two adults comfortably or three kids with ease. Every seat is embossed with Harley stitching and logos.\n\nWhile in Hell, I stopped for lunch at the Dam Site Inn, a well-known biker bar and eatery. It’s one of three stops along the half-mile stretch of damnation. Two dozen Harleys were parked outside the building where hardcore bikers and RUBs mingled and ate.\n\nIt’s getting hard to tell the real McCoy from the weekend wannabe. But who really cares when I’m cruising around in a beast like this.\n\nThe fastest way to Hell may still be a two-wheeled Harley, but in Ford’s latest version at least I won’t end up there with bugs in my teeth.\n\nI can live with that.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "Ford’s risky redesign of F-150 pays off beautifully\n\nLiving among family and friends who include tradespeople of various talents — plumbers, builders, contractors — here is what I came to expect of the inside of a pickup truck: Upright front seats pushed hard against the back wall of the cab; a confetti storm of paperwork (bills, architectural plans, job estimates, wiring layouts) stuffed in every nook and cranny. Buried somewhere in all this: maybe a cellphone, maybe a tape measure, other smaller tools and certainly some empty coffee cups. It was, after all, a rolling workbench/office.\n\nNo more. Consider the redesigned 2004 Ford F-150 pickup truck.\n\nBigger on the outside, more powerful under the hood, yet boasting easy access and an interior that bespeaks quiet family travel as fine as in a luxury SUV.\n\nWelcome to the world of “personal use” pickup trucks, with Ford at this point leapfrogging the competition with tires planted in both the world of the contractor and the world of the active family.\n\nKeep in mind that the F-150 series of Ford pickups has been billed the best-selling vehicle in automotive history. Last year, Ford sold more than 800,000 of them. A redesign might seem a risky proposition, but Ford tackled it with powerful grace. When it came time to swap my test truck — a high-end F-150 Lariat — for my next test car — a 2004 BMW 5 Series — there was wailing in the family that the truck had to go. We liked it that much.\n\nThe redesign comes out of necessity even as Ford pushes to get back into the neglected passenger car market. General Motors and Dodge are stiff competitors. Toyota is bringing us a Tundra pickup with four full doors. Nissan has launched the imposing Titan pickup and Honda and South Korean manufacturers are testing the edges of big truck production.\n\nThe F-150 comes in a wide range of models that include regular cab, SuperCab, and SuperCrew. The first has a front seat and small rear doors allowing access to storage space behind the seat. SuperCab gives a full rear seat and somewhat larger, rear-opening doors. The SuperCrew has four full-size doors. All cabs benefit by the six inches of extra space that has been added to the interior. Bed choices are 5 1/2, 6 1/2, and 8 feet. Rear- and four-wheel-drive setups are available. What is remarkable about the rugged exterior and the big power under the hood is how refined Ford has made the interior. Brushed metal trim surrounds a central control stack with audio and climate controls and is replicated in nice touches on the dash, doors, and center console. The leather seats are expansive and firm. Leg room, front and rear, seem limo-like. Power ports abound, as do storage areas. Toss in a DVD player and you can take the kids to Florida in this truck.\n\nMoving these big rigs — and all they will haul in gear and people — meant an engine upgrade by Ford. Two engines are available: a 4.6-liter, 16-valve V-8 that produces 231 horsepower and 293 lb.-ft. of torque, or a 5.4-liter V-8 (as tested) with three valves per cylinder that delivers 300 horsepower and a big-hauling 365 lb.-ft. of torque. The engines are mated to Ford 4-speed automatic transmissions, some on the column, some on the floor at center console. The bigger engine moved the truck with sure surges of power even as it remained whisper quiet. The steering was surprisingly light and responsive, and the truck was flat and stable even in hard corners.\n\nThe suspension features an independent double wishbone system upfront with control arms, coils on shocks, and anti-roll bar. The rear features a rigid axle with leaf springs and shocks mounted outside the frame.\n\nThe brakes, ABS standard, are hydraulic with vacuum power assist. Mate that to 13-inch-plus discs and there’s no trouble stopping this rig quickly.\n\nRedesigning the best-selling vehicle in your lineup can be risky. ord has easily won this gamble.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nDespite the ups and downs in the truck market, the Ford F-150 remains the top-selling pickup in the U.S. and has garnered various awards. The truck’s platform remains the same for 2013, but adds noticeable visual changes and slight refinements to the interior. The F-150 seats up to six people in certain configurations, and competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra.\n\nWith a variety of trim levels, there’s an F-150 that meets just about every segment of truck buyer out there, including those who use a light-duty pickup for work, play and simply to look good driving down the street. Truck owners wanting a custom look can choose the FX Appearance Package, which brings unique flat-black 20-inch wheels.  The King Ranch and Platinum bring high levels of luxury, while the Baja-ready SVT Raptor remains the prime choice for spirited off-road driving.\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the F-150 gets revised exterior styling. Available high-intensity-discharge headlights look similar to those on the Explorer and Edge crossovers. XLT and other work-oriented trims get a new two-bar grille while uplevel trims have a three-bar design. Tow mirrors that power-fold and power-extend are available.\n\nInside, uplevel trims like the Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and new Limited get MyFord Touch and its 8-inch touch-screen in the middle of the dashboard. Other F-150s get a new 4.2-inch dash screen for the stereo and climate systems.\nExterior\nThe 2013 Ford F-150 is available as a regular cab, SuperCab, and four-door SuperCrew, and can be had with a 5.5-, 6.5- or 8-foot bed. Exterior features include:\n\n\nFlat-black-themed FX Appearance Package\nAvailable 20-inch wheels \nAvailable rear parking sensors and backup camera \nAvailable running boards or tubular side steps \nAvailable two-tone paint on some models \nAvailable tailgate step and cargo box side steps\n\nInterior\nFX4 and FX2 trucks with the FX Appearance Package have black leather seats with red piping.

Interior features include:\n\n\nSeating for up to six\nPremium Chaparral leather seats (King Ranch)\nFlip-up rear seat on SuperCab and SuperCrew\nAvailable MyFord Touch system with 8-inch screen\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe range of engines for the F-150 allows truck shoppers to select the power and fuel-economy levels that best match their needs. In any case, the F-150’s six-speed automatic transmission continues to play a key role in its fuel efficiency. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nBase 3.7-liter V-6 delivers 302 horsepower and 278 pounds-feet of torque\n5.0-liter V-8 delivers 360 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque \nTwin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 delivers 365 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque \n6.2-liter V-8 delivers 411 hp and 434 pounds-feet of torque \nAvailable electronic locking rear differential\nAvailable towing package\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control  and Trailer Sway Control\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats \nSide curtain airbags\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controller",

      "expert_review": "Any time a celebrity relationship lasts more than a decade, you wonder how the couple keeps it from getting stale and if there’s enough substance underneath for the relationship to continue. Maybe they’re not actual celebrities, but the Ford and Harley-Davidson relationship, now in its 12th year, has definitely given birth to some amazing offspring.\n\nOver that time, there have been 10 F-150s and six Super Duty models, with the first F-450 model in 2009. In all, more than 70,000 Harley F-Series packages have been sold since 1999.\n\nWith all those years of success behind Ford and Harley, their relationship might be showing signs of conflict. In fact, the newest Ford Harley truck in the lineup might be the most confused model to date.\n\nThe 2012 Ford Harley-Davidson F-150 is relatively unchanged from last year: It has the same 6.2-liter V-8 under the hood and more Harley-Davidson emblems than you can count. But the model now offers a new four-wheel-drive transfer case and a few new design details. As it turns out, the transfer case is largely responsible for this truck’s oddly conflicted personality.\n\nMore than ever before, this new Harley F-150 is a confused combination of performance truck styling with weakened real-truck capabilities.\n\nLast year, Ford made manufacturing the F-150 simpler by reducing the number of transfer cases available to a single unit that provides the benefits of all-wheel drive and an extra low-range gear. The new transfer case has a setting called 4A, which stands for automatic all-wheel drive. This setting puts the vehicle in full-time all-wheel-drive mode. However, it should be noted that Ford’s all-wheel-drive mode is different from GM’s transfer case. The Ford system does not send power to all four wheels until it actually detects some amount of slip. The Auto setting on GM’s full-size pickups and SUVs sends power to all four wheels all the time, but it can vary the proportion instantaneously based on input from sensors.\n\nOne of the advantages of Ford’s new transfer case is that the 4A setting effectively runs like a normal rear-drive vehicle, running more efficiently, in typical high-traction situations. But as soon as any wheel slip is detected, the front drive axle engages like a light switch until the sensors determine that front drive is no longer needed. Then the system goes back to rear drive.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the 4-High or 4-Low settings, which basically lock the center differential and split the available engine torque between the front and rear drive shafts. The front axle is open, while the Harley package includes the normal rear-locking differential that can be engaged only in low range, which makes sense for a rock crawler but not for a sportier performance truck.\n\nThis is the first Harley F-150 to offer a transfer case with a low-range gear; all other Harley F-150s have been rear- or all-wheel drive. And, yes, four-wheel drive was offered in Super Duty Harley-Davidson models.\n\nWe drove the 2012 Harley F-150 on a road trip up Interstate 94 from Chicago to Milwaukee, the birthplace of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\n\nThe route allowed us to do some comfortable, wintertime cruising as we averaged about 65 mph on the open road, with temperatures hovering around 40 degrees. At that speed, the Harley F-150 lumbered along around 1,700 rpm, and our computer readout told us we were averaging around 17.2 mpg over our 100-mile highway cruise. By the end of the trip, with two gas fill-ups under our belt by the time we turned in the truck, we had an overall average of 14.2 mpg in the city, which included a rush-hour drive out of Chicago and an accidental tour of downtown Milwaukee, running from the Harley-Davidson Museum (see our tour story) to the company’s headquarters on West Juneau Avenue, about a mile and half away.\n\nThe Harley package comes standard with the larger 36-gallon tank, allowing the big V-8 to take the F-150 somewhere between 400 and 600 miles on one tank of fuel, depending on how you drive. And just like last year, all 2012 Harleys come with 3.73:1 gears. At this time, no alternate gearing or engine options are available (which is too bad; we’d like to see a 3.55:1 EcoBoost at some point).\n\nEPA fuel economy numbers aren’t pretty for the V-8 Harley F-150: 12/16 mpg city/highway and 13 mpg combined.\n\nAmong the truck’s strengths, the throaty rumble of the exhaust note is our favorite. As you might expect, the big-bore, twin-spark-plug V-8 engine makes 411 horsepower and 434 pounds-feet of torque, stuffing a lot of power through the manifolds and tubes. The 6R140 six-speed transmission was a little quick to upshift when motoring through traffic (it would be nice and clearly appropriate with the Harley edition to offer some kind of Sport mode), but we continue to appreciate the thumb-touch gearshift button that allows for quicker and more assured manual shifting. That said, we have to note this is one of the smartest downshifting transmissions of any pickup truck, which becomes even more apparent when mated to the power of this V-8. In some cases the transmission dropped from 6th to 3rd gear when we needed to put the hammer down, causing a launch worthy of any sports car’s respect.\n\nWe didn’t get a chance to run the new Harley F-150 on a track, but we’re guessing the overall zero-to-60-mph time would be right on top of the 2011 model, which Motor Trend track-tested during its time with the truck at a scorching 6.4 seconds.\n\nAs we noted earlier, among the more significant changes in the 2012 Harley F-150 is the transfer case, which has permanent all-wheel-drive capability and part-time low-range capability (a new addition for higher trim levels such as Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Harley). We especially appreciated this new feature when about 6 inches of snow fell overnight in Milwaukee, causing some questionable conditions on all the roads through and around the city. Being able to flip the transfer case dial into all-wheel drive gave us the sure-footedness needed to keep the truck under control and moving with traffic, even with very erratic grip conditions on the road.\n\nWe even got to pull out a late-90s front-wheel-drive Honda CR-V that was parked nose-in into a downhill curb at the Harley museum. Snow plows had wedged a pile of snow behind the back tires to the point the front tires couldn’t push them up and over the berm. The passengers were standing there in the snow with a strap in hand when we almost drove by. We probably could have tugged the CR-V in 4A or 4-High, but we opted to pull it out gently in low range, pulling the vehicle through the snow mounds.\n\nUnfortunately, it was during the snow flurries when we discovered the Harley front-end styling package does not allow for a tow-hook option. So we wrapped the strap around the lower control arm — certainly not the best choice, but standing in the Wisconsin cold, we weren’t going to delay — and gently tugged the CR-V to better ground. Who would have thought that high-profile Pirelli Scorpion Zero tires had so much grip in snow? For the rest of the day, as we drove around the neighborhoods and city streets of Milwaukee, we had a great deal of fun driving in 4A with traction control turned off.\n\nOther minor changes for the 2012 Harley F-150 include interior and exterior designs — one we like, the other not so much. Whereas the 2011 model was offered with brushed aluminum inserts, this year there are several more stylish leather snakeskin accents throughout — on the seats, steering wheel and center console. At first glance, it’s subtle enough to miss, but once your eye catches the inlayed texture and color changes when contrasted with the formal black dashboard and trim pieces, the snakeskin pieces look very cool and tie into the Harley mystique quite well.\n\nOutside, the design changes don’t work so well. The new Harley F-150 graphics package almost looks like some windblown clothing or material is stuck onto the side of the truck. Also, if you look closely, the snakeskin design also appears on the exterior graphics package. Interesting for sure, but the leather look on the outside of the truck doesn’t work as well as inside. They missed it with that one.\n\nLikewise, the new rims have a “wavy gravy” look that doesn’t seem masculine or aggressive — it’s sort of odd that they look like they’re melting or losing their shape. Add to that the fact that the high-profile 275/45R22 tires look like rubber bands on a four-wheel-drive truck, and we begin to pick up on some odd personality conflicts with this truck. Calling this Harley F-150 schizophrenic would be an overstatement, but combined with the real four-wheel-drive transfer case, it does seem to lack some design and engineering consistency. Is it a performance truck, or does it want to be a real truck? Trying to be both means it’s likely not to do either very well.\n\nAs to the “truck-ness” of the new Harley F-150, except for the years they were based on the Super Duty platforms, these partner packages have never really been hard workers. The gross vehicle weight rating of our test truck — a short-bed SuperCrew — was 7,350 pounds, and the as-tested weight was 6,240 pounds, leaving a total payload weight of 1,110 pounds. That’s certainly not horrible, but only if you’re comparing it to an F-150 SVT Raptor (which, we might add, seems to be a much better example of a clearly executed design and engineering exercise).\n\nHowever, if you compare these figures to other SuperCrew 4×4 F-150 models, you are losing almost 700 pounds in payload and more than 3,000 pounds in towing capacity. (Our 4×4 could tow up to 7,300 pounds). For payload, if you add a few passengers to the Harley, you’re looking at the bed capacity being about 700 pounds, about half the capacity of a Honda Ridgeline — not so good for a full-size pickup. (We know criticizing the truck for these types of shortcomings might be a little like criticizing a Porsche 911 for not offering a DVD entertainment system for backseat passengers, but it’s worth pointing out.)\n\nIn terms of overall value, we fully expect Ford to sell every Harley package it makes. But with a base price of $52,990 (including a $995 destination fee), you can imagine that not much is left on the options list for a customer to choose. Among our favorite details, the 8-inch touch-screen integrates the voice-activated navigation system, climate control and SiriusXM satellite radio.\n\nWe continue to be huge fans of the 4.2-inch LCD productivity screen, which sits between the tachometer and speedometer. It gives us access to all sorts of information about fuel economy, towing performance and even four-wheel-drive advice. Other standard features include a power moonroof, rearview camera, rear heated seats, ambient lighting, remote start, 110-volt power inverter and more. Our test unit came with a bed extender ($250) and a tailgate step ($375), giving us a grand total of $53,615.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line here? This is clearly an impressive vehicle, and Ford continues to be the best in the industry at executing these types of themed vehicles. But this particular Harley-Ford pairing might be trying to do too much. Sure, you get a lot for your money, but what kind of truck, and the resulting tradeoffs, are you really getting? To put the most positive spin on it, this is a great sport truck that also offers real four-wheel-drive capability. But to put a more realistic spin on it, you’re getting much less capability for your money and paying more, too (and you have to ride on 22-inch rims).",
