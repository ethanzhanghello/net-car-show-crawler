      "expert_review": "If big SUVs knot your shorts, please turn to the letters column now and come back to this space next week.\n\nToday we review the 2007 Ford Expedition EL sport-utility. EL stands for extra long, with a 12-inch longer wheelbase and 14.8 inches greater overall length than the regular model, which is pretty substantial to begin with.\n\nThe full-size Expedition was redesigned for 2007 and an EL added now that the gargantuan Excursion is gone.\n\nThere’s lots to like about the EL, even the really potent 5.4-liter, 300-horsepower V-8 with a new 6-speed automatic transmission. Touch the pedal and go, no waiting on- or off-road or up steep inclines where 18-wheelers and those tiny gas sippers gasp for breath.\n\nBut prepare for frequent stops. No government mileage rating is required because EL tops 8,500 pounds. The same 5.4-liter in the regular-length Expedition is rated at 14 m.p.g. city/20 m.p.g. highway, wishful thinking on the EL.\n\nPleasant ride and decent handling for a vehicle that sits high for great visibility as well as ample clearance for heavy snow or off-roading. Despite the size, braking is excellent; four-wheel anti-lock brakes plus stability control with rollover control are standard. Still, consider the length and weight and approach sharp turns with respect–and at fewer m.p.h.\n\nNice touches include standard running boards–much needed for those shorter than 6 feet; dial-up 4WD with a low setting for off-road; power side rear windows; and a cargo hold parcel divider to keep items from sliding around.\n\nPower third-row seats fold flat to expand the already huge cargo hold, and a power rear tailgate opens by touching a button in the dash or on the key fob.\n\nFirst- and second-row seating is well cushioned with good lateral support for driver and passenger. But side bolsters in rows two and three are marginal.\n\nGetting into or out of the third row is easy thanks to second-row seats that flip and fold quickly (after lowering the headrests) to create a wide aisle.\n\nLots of third-row head room, but seats are firm and bottoms short with little thigh support.\n\nOne nagging problem, slipping a vehicle 14.8 inches longer than the barge-size Expedition into a parking space–any parking space. You think that’s bad? Try to get back inside the vehicle when another vehicle–any size vehicle–parks too close to your doors. And don’t forget, you’ll still have to back out of the parking space without tattooing any nearby vehicle.\n\nGas prices aside, Ford sold 16,225 Expeditions in October-November, up from 12,774 a year earlier. EL accounts for 61 percent of those sales, and 40 percent of trade-ins on EL are non-Fords, compared with 20 percent on the regular-length SUV.\n\nBut Ford is realistic about the full-size SUV market.\n\n“We aren’t getting new buyers as we are getting those trading in an older full-size SUV,” said George Pipas, Ford sales analyst. “Sales have been strong since the new Expedition came out, but this segment accounted for industry sales of 1 million units two years ago, 880,000 a year ago and will account for less than 700,000 this year, with further declines expected.”\n\nSo, Ford’s Michigan truck plant that assembles Expedition and Lincoln Navigator will go from two shifts to one in the second quarter to keep inventory in line with sales expectations.\n\nWhy keep building them?\n\n“There are customers who need this size, space and towing capability, aren’t concerned about gas prices and who use it to haul a large family or pull a boat or trailer,” Pipas said.\n\nBase price: $41,125, but prepare to tickle if not top $50,000 after adding $1,995 for navigation system, $1,500 for DVD entertainment system, $495 for power liftgate, $1,095 for 20-inch all-season radials, $950 power moonroof, $625 for heated/cooled front seats. All that’s before tax.\n\nChrysler Aspen\n\nDodge dealers complained that Jeep had a compact SUV, the Liberty, and they didn’t.\n\nAnd Chrysler dealers complained Dodge dealers had a midsize SUV, the Durango, and they didn’t.\n\nSo Chrysler Group gave Dodge dealers a version of Liberty called Nitro and Chrysler dealers a version of Durango called Aspen for ’07.\n\nNow everyone is happy, except Jeep dealers, of course, who don’t have a version of the Chrysler 300C sedan or Dodge Viper sports car. But we digress.\n\nWe tested the 2007 Aspen in top-of-the-line Limited trim and four-wheel-drive.\n\nThanks to the design staff, Aspen and Durango look nothing alike.\n\nAspen, like Durango, seats up to eight in three rows but does so in formal, rather than casual, attire with wood and metal trim.\n\nAspen offers a choice of a 4.7-liter, 235-h.p. V-8 or a 5.7-liter, 335-h.p. Hemi V-8. Durango the same plus a 3.7-liter, 210-h.p. V-6 mileage leader, if 16 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway is anything to brag about.\n\nWe tested the 4.7-liter Aspen. Plenty of power to move this midsize SUV derived from the Dakota pickup. But at more than 5,000 pounds, it’s rated at 14 m.p.g. city/18 highway. The Hemi is better at 14/19 thanks to a system that shuts off four cylinders when not needed.\n\nChrylser dealers now have a midsize SUV–just as consumers are migrating to compact SUVs, midsize cars and crossovers for better mileage.\n\nJ.D. Power & Associates statistics show that midsize SUV sales are down 12 percent through November, to 1.08 million units, and full-size SUVs are off 13 percent, to 458,151. In the premium segment where Aspen plays, midsize sales are down 13.5 percent but full-size models such as the Cadillac Escalade are up 12.5 percent.\n\nChrysler sold 4,623 Aspens in September-November, the first three months it was out. That’s 4,623 sales Chrysler dealers wouldn’t have had without it.\n\nHowever, Dodge dealers sold 18,519 Durangos, 9,300 fewer than a year ago. So Chrysler division’s gain comes at the expense of Dodge division and Chrysler Group.\n\nGeorge Murphy, senior vice president of global brand marketing for Chrysler, boasts that Aspen offers customers a “value alternative” to full-size SUVs.\n\nNot value in terms of mileage–or truck-like ride and handling.\n\nBase price: $33,520 full of power and pleasure amenities as well as safety items including side-curtain air bags, stability control and four-wheel ABS.\n\nAdd $875 for leather seats, $360 for U-Connect hands-free phone and $455 for the trailer towing group. Costly options were missing from the test SUV. Those include a navigation system at $1,595, which comes with AM/FM radio and six-disc CD changer, and a rear-seat DVD system at $1,200.\n\n– – –\n\n2007 Ford Expedition EL 4×4\n\nPrice as tested: $48,290*\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$41,125 Base\n\n$1,500 Rear-seat DVD entertainment system\n\n$1,095 20-inch all-season radials\n\n$950 Power moonroof\n\n$795 Second-row captain’s chairs\n\n$675 Convenience package with reverse sensing system, power pedals, power rear quarter windows\n\n$625 Heated/cooled front seats\n\n$495 Power liftgate\n\n$485 Load-leveling suspension\n\n$350 Trailer-towing package\n\n$195 Sirius satellite radio with six-months free service\n\n*Add $820 for freight.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nWheelbase: 131 inches\n\nLength: 220.5 inches\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter, 300-h.p.

      "expert_review": "The Ford Expedition might not be the most-timely vehicle on the market, but it’s certainly one that Texans might find appealing – even with the high gasoline prices.\n\nAnd added just last year is the EL version, is an extended-length model giving Ford a direct competitor to the longtime Texas favorite, the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nIt’s even slightly bigger, with an overall length 1.2 inches more than that of the current Suburban and its clone, the GMC Yukon XL.\n\nIntroduced for 2007 along with the second-generation Expedition, the EL returned for 2008 with some new standard equipment and a new King Ranch version, another variation designed to lure Texas buyers.\n\nThe EL model replaced the much-larger Excursion, which was discontinued after 2006.\n\nThe Excursion originally was intended by Ford to compete directly against the Suburban, but its behemoth dimensions and poor fuel economy made it unsuitable for most people who might have considered it an alternative to the Suburban.\n\nIt also became a symbol of excess for Ford and the SUV genre as a whole. It brought Ford Motor Co. notoriety and ridicule, particularly in liberal hot spots such as California – even while the Suburban continued to be one of the most popular sport utilities on the market.\n\nThe Excursion eventually became a target for radical environmental activists, and some owners reported vandalism to their vehicles after leaving them parked at malls or on city streets in California.\n\nIts best year was its first – 2000 – when 50,786 were sold; total sales for 2005 were just 16,283 overall.\n\nAlthough sales of large truck-based SUVs have slipped further this year as gasoline prices have spiked above $3 a gallon, Ford believes that the Expedition EL is still a viable product that gives Ford fans an alternative to the Suburban.\n\nBut taking on the Suburban is no easy task. About one-fourth of all Suburban/Yukon XLs produced by General Motors are sold in Texas.\n\nTotal GM large utility vehicle sales in Texas last year were about triple those for Ford. Those sales include the luxury Hummer, Cadillac and Lincoln models. Lincoln has a similar, new long version of the Navigator that competes against the Suburban-length Cadillac Escalade ESV.\n\nEven though GM is dominant in the large SUV market here, Texas is Ford’s leading market for the Expedition. Two of every 10 Expeditions are sold to Texas consumers.\n\nBoth automakers introduced completely redesigned large SUVs for 2007, and this year GM is rolling out gasoline-electric hybrid versions of the shorter-length Tahoe and Yukon.\n\nFord and GM are struggling over weak sales and declining profits from their cash cows – trucks and SUVs – both of whose sales have fallen in response to the higher gasoline prices.\n\nBoth automakers are working to shore up their car offerings so that they can depend less on truck and SUV sales for the bulk of their per-vehicle profits.\n\nThe newest generation of the Expedition has an exterior design that was inspired by the company’s F-series trucks. But there were other major changes to the vehicle last year besides styling. It rides on an entirely new chassis and has suspension, safety and interior improvements as well.\n\nUnder the hood is Ford’s 5.4-liter Triton V-8 engine, rated at 300 horsepower and 365 foot-pounds of torque. It’s powerful enough to tow up to 9,100 pounds.\n\nThe engine is connected to a new six-speed automatic transmission, which Ford says will help improve fuel economy over the previous Expedition’s four-speed automatic.\n\nFord’s high-tech roll stability control system is standard on both models.\n\nAn optional three-row Safety Canopy rollover-detection system adds side-curtain air bags. The system automatically deploys the air bag canopy to protect the passengers.\n\nBeyond these changes, Ford cited “big improvements in capability, functionality and toughness” for the Expedition, as well as “new levels of interior refinement, flexibility and quietness.”\n\nAdding the EL model probably was the most important change, though, especially for Texas consumers.\n\nTo create the EL, Ford lengthened the regular Expedition by 14.8 inches, most of which went into additional cargo space behind the third row of seats.\n\nThat gives the EL 130.8 cubic feet of cargo space, which includes 24 more cubic feet behind the third seat than is found in the standard-length model.\n\nThe EL is built on a 131-inch wheelbase, a foot longer than that of the regular Expedition.\n\nFord says the EL model is unique from just behind the front seat all the way to the rear, with its own floor pan, exterior side panels, running boards, rear fascia, roof rack, rear quarter windows, headliner and quarter-panel trim.\n\nThe second-row doors also are different from the standard Expedition; they are larger to help improve ease of entry and exit to the second and third rows of seats.\n\nUp front on both models are a new, prominent grille, a raised hood, dual-beam headlights and integrated side-marker lights wrapped into the front fenders.\n\nA number of wheel and tire combinations are offered, including 20-inch, five-spoke chrome wheels.\n\nFord said the inside was made more carlike because these vehicles are most often bought for family use and many are regularly driven by women.\n\nBesides the King Ranch model, trim levels include XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited models. Leather seats are available in up-level models, along with amenities such as mahogany wood interior accents, a 10-way power driver’s seat, and both heated and cooled front seats.\n\nThe middle seat can be folded into the floor to increase cargo space as well as to allow easier access to the third seat. That seat, of course, can be folded flat into the floor when not needed.\n\nFord says the third seat is designed to accommodate passengers up to 6 feet 2 inches tall. The optional Powerfold third seat folds flat into the floor with the push of a button.\n\nA power tailgate also is offered.\n\nOther options include a DVD-based navigation system, a 340-watt AM/FM audio system with MP3-capable six-disc in-dash CD changer and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nThere is a jack on this stereo to which an external device such as an MP3 player or iPod can be hooked up.\n\nBoth models are available with four-wheel drive. This is a serious four-by-four system with shift-on-the-fly capability and a two-speed transfer case for low-range operation in extreme off-road conditions.\n\nExpedition prices for 2008 range from $30,620-$45,515 (plus freight), with EL models beginning at $34,145 and topping out at the $45,515 mark for the King Ranch edition.\n\nEPA ratings are 12 mpg city/18 highway for the two-wheel-drive models.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ford Expedition is a truck-based full-size SUV that can carry up to eight people. The SUV comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trim levels. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. There’s a longer version called the Expedition EL. It’s about 15 inches longer and has a standard third-row seat. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Expedition receives trailer-sway control standard, to help prevent trailer sway during towing.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. Regular- and extended-length Expeditions sport the same exterior styling.\n\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard power, heated mirrors\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\nOptional 18- or 20-inch wheels\nOptional power liftgate\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to nine occupants across three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor — a feature not offered in all competitors. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional on lower trims and standard on higher ones.\n\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional Sync multimedia system\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nOptional power-folding third row\nOptional navigation system\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, the Expedition comes only as a half-ton truck. The sole powertrain is now a flex-fuel engine that can run on E85.\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nOptional part-time four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension\n\nSafety\nThe Expedition has not been crash-tested by our preferred source, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores five stars in government front-crash tests, which is the highest rating possible. A new trailer-sway control feature is standard and works in conjunction with the electronic stability system to detect trailer movement and apply braking, as well as reduce engine torque to keep the vehicle in control. A standard MyKey system allows parents to impose vehicle restrictions on teen drivers. Parents can limit the vehicle’s top speed, add a persistent seat-belt reminder, limit the volume on the stereo to 44 percent of its maximum volume, and have a speed chime activate at 45, 55 or 65 mph.\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard MyKey\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with anti-rollover technology\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS Post-Crash Alert System\nStandard trailer-sway control\nOptional rearview camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ford Expedition is a truck-based, full-size SUV that can carry up to eight people. The SUV comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trim levels. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. A longer version, called the Expedition EL, is about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. Regular- and extended-length Expeditions sport the same exterior styling. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard heated mirrors\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\nOptional 18- or 20-inch wheels\nOptional power liftgate\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to eight occupants across three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional on lower trims and standard on higher ones. Interior features include:\n\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional Sync multimedia system\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nOptional power-folding third row\nOptional navigation system\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, the Expedition comes only as a half-ton truck. The sole powertrain is a flex-fuel engine that can run on E85.\n\nSafety\nA trailer-sway control feature is standard and works in conjunction with the electronic stability system to detect trailer movement and apply braking, as well as reduce engine torque, to keep the vehicle in control. A standard MyKey system allows parents to impose vehicle restrictions on teen drivers. Parents can limit the vehicle’s top speed, add a persistent seat-belt reminder, limit the volume on the stereo to 44 percent of its maximum volume and have a speed chime activate at 45, 55 or 65 mph. Safety features include:\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard MyKey\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with anti-rollover technology\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS Post-Crash Alert System\nStandard trailer sway control\nOptional rearview camera",

      "expert_review": "Compared with the latest crossovers, the Ford Expedition feels primitive, dated and in need of some love — but compared with full-size SUV competitors, the Expedition remains top dog.\n\nThe response I received whenever I told someone I was reviewing a new 2013 Ford Expedition EL was always the same: “Ford still makes those?” Heard it at least a half-dozen times. And the answer is yes, Ford most definitely still makes the big Expedition — and it remains one of the company’s most profitable products. Admittedly, Ford doesn’t put the same kind of attention into marketing and selling its behemoth SUV as it did in its heyday, and sales of these kinds of trucks — both at Ford and throughout the industry — are nothing like they were just a decade ago. Trucks like these have largely been replaced by large, car-based crossovers like the Ford Flex, but for someone who has big cargo or towing needs, nothing but a truck-based, full-sized, V-8-powered SUV will do.\n\nThere are just a handful of changes from the 2012 to the 2013 model (see a model year comparison here).\n\nTwo Sizes: Big and Bigger\nThe Ford Expedition comes in two styles: a regular-length, full-size SUV and the longer EL version, which adds considerable length. Both have a third row in the form of a three-person split bench that folds down for extra cargo capacity. My tester was the extended EL version, which adds an extra foot to the wheelbase and a full 14.8 inches to the truck’s overall length. All that extra space goes behind the second-row seats, keeping dimensions the same in the first two rows. It makes a considerable difference for third-row passengers, adding a full 15.2 inches of shoulder room by repositioning the seat. Legroom is unchanged, so it also adds a lot of room behind the third row, increasing cargo capacity from 18.6 cubic feet to 42.6 cubic feet. Both the second and the third rows fold flat to create a massive space suitable for hauling just about anything. While the regular Expedition can carry plenty of people and stuff, the EL is a clear winner in terms of truly massive cargo-carrying ability.\n\nStill, its numbers are slightly smaller than the Expedition’s main body-type competitors, the Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon/Yukon XL, which represent short/extended versions of GM’s SUVs. Among shorter-wheelbase versions, the Expedition has the edge, with greater cargo room behind the third-row seat but roughly equal cargo capacity with both the second and third rows stowed. Among extended-length versions of both companies’ trucks, GM gets the nod, with the Suburban and Yukon XL boasting 137.4 cubic feet of total cargo volume to the Expedition EL’s 130.8. In addition to this space advantage, the GM trucks offer an optional front bench seat in some models, extending the passenger count to nine versus the Expedition’s maximum of eight.\n\nBig Truck + Big Engine = Big Thirst\nWith all this room for people and stuff, you need some serious grunt to get the rig up to speed. Ford provides just one engine for the Ford Expedition EL, a 5.4-liter V-8 making 310 horsepower and 365 pounds-feet of torque. Ford’s EcoBoost technology hasn’t yet made it into a full-size SUV, so there’s nothing turbocharged available — no direct-injection technology, not even four valves per cylinder. Power is routed through a standard six-speed automatic transmission to either the rear wheels or to a mode-selectable all-wheel-drive system featuring automatic, high- and low-range modes.\n\nThe big V-8 provides adequate power — if you’re not in a hurry. Throttle response is relaxed, and at no point do you forget you’re piloting three tons of old-style, body-on-frame truck. There’s plenty of torque available for hauling a boat or trailer, but when compared with the upgraded engine options in the GM stable, the 5.4-liter feels weak. The standard engine for the Suburban/Yukon XL is a 5.3-liter Vortec V-8 making 320 hp and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Those numbers are comparable to the Expedition, but the GM trucks offer a bigger 352-hp, 6.0-liter motor with 382 pounds-feet of torque in their heavy-duty versions. And if that’s still not enough power, you can upgrade to a Yukon XL Denali for a 6.2-liter monster motor making 403 hp and 417 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe brakes are more than up to the task of bringing the big truck to a stop, with standard antilock braking. Strong, progressive and firm, the brakes are among the Expedition’s strengths. Handling is what one would expect in such a beast — fairly numb around town and in parking lots, but stable at highway speeds. It won’t be your choice for weekend canyon-carving, but hauling the basketball team to a game is no sweat. Ride quality is truck-like but comfortable; the sheer mass of the Expedition lets it swallow bumps and broken pavement with little interruption to passengers’ serenity. Compared with a big crossover like Ford’s own Flex, the ride is not as refined and the handling is not as crisp, but these are the trade-offs one makes for the Expedition’s cargo room and towing capability. Owning an Expedition means being no stranger to gas pumps. In a lot of mixed driving, I recorded an average 15 mpg overall, a respectable figure that won’t surprise anyone in the market for such a truck. My observed mileage matches the EPA estimates precisely — the Expedition EL 4×4 is rated 13/18 mpg city/highway, with a 15 mpg combined rating. The 4×2 version gets slightly better mileage, rated 14/20 mpg city/highway and 16 mpg combined. There are no mileage differences between regular and extended-length versions.\n\nJust as Old School Inside\nClimbing up into the cabin — which I did with the help of optional retractable running boards — puts you in a large, comfortable leather seat with a commanding view. It’s not hard to see why high-riding SUVs gained widespread popularity; the view up there is impressive. The layout of the Expedition’s controls and switches is logical, and everything is within reach. The design is last-generation; the Expedition was last updated way back in 2007 and has not yet fallen in line with the interior quality of the latest Fords. Materials are hard plastic, mold seams are visible, and the fake wood is just a bit too glossy by current Ford standards. But it is quiet and comfortable, and with a thick steering wheel nicely centered for the driver (a trait the GM trucks do not share), it’s still a better place to spend a long road trip than the even more outdated GM models.\n\nFord’s Sync voice activation is present, but the generally reviled MyFord Touch system is not yet available in the Expedition. Instead, you get the past generation of the old-style Sync system — which, frankly, works quite well: It responds better and makes fewer errors than Ford’s latest voice-controlled nightmare. The big touch-screen in the center console is smaller than most competitors’ screens these days, but it also works well and is reasonably uncluttered, if visually outdated. The navigation system is similarly ready for an update, but there’s something to be said for previous-generation, bug-free systems.\n\nFor passengers, the Ford Expedition EL is a great cruiser. Space in the second and third rows is decent even for adult-sized passengers, but the fact that this is a body-on-frame truck means that its higher load floor compromises somewhat on legroom. Third-row passengers have their knees fairly high up, but the extra width provided by the EL minimizes this discomfort. Fold everything down, and you get a flat floor without having to remove the third row of seats, as is required in the GM models. That ability to keep the third row with you when filling the truck with cargo is a major advantage over the GM trucks, which force the driver to choose between hauling cargo and leaving the seats behind or compromising on room.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the 2013 Ford Expedition’s results are mixed, ranging from two stars for a side impact into a pole to a five-star side-impact rating overall. The Expedition’s overall rating is four stars, matching the GM models. See the Expedition’s safety ratings here. The Ford has six standard airbags: two front, two front-seat side and two side curtain airbags that descend from the ceiling to protect all three rows of seats in a side impact or rollover. The Nissan Armada and Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon feature the same airbag count. See the Expedition’s safety ratings here. NHTSA gives the Expedition a rollover rating of three out of five stars. Full-size SUVs are among the last vehicles on the market with ratings this low, representing a greater propensity to roll over. Minivans and crossover SUVs, including large ones, typically score four stars. Much of this derives from full-size SUVs’ origins as high-riding trucks, whereas minivans and crossovers tend to be car-based with a lower center of gravity. For all the Expedition’s features and safety specs, click here.\n\nIn the Market\nThe full-size SUV market may be a fraction of what it was, but there are still several options for shoppers. The 2013 Expedition starts at $41,600 including a $995 destination charge, $44,310 for the EL. Three trim levels are available for both models: XLT, Limited and the top-of-the-line King Ranch. I tested an Ford Expedition EL Limited 4×4, which starts at $53,425 and includes leather seats, a backup camera, all-wheel drive, a power-folding third-row seat, heated second-row seats, rear climate control, rain-sensing wipers and a heavy-duty trailer tow package. My tester included an optional equipment group that threw in a power moonroof, power retractable running boards and a navigation system, plus stand-alone options of a load-leveling air suspension, a remote-start system and 20-inch polished aluminum alloy wheels. All this content pushed the Expedition EL Limited to an as-tested price of $60,735, which is generally on par with its biggest competitors in the GM family of full-size trucks. See full specs for the 2013 Expedition here. Some of the Expedition’s biggest competition comes from within the Ford brand, in the form of the company’s large crossovers, like the Flex. The trend in recent years for many family buyers has been to downsize out of behemoth truck-based SUVs and into more reasonable car-based crossovers like the Flex and Explorer. These smaller models don’t have the towing capacity or passenger room that the larger ones do, but they can seat seven people and fulfill most of the duties for which buyers purchased big trucks. (See how the Expedition compares with competitors here.) Yet the new wave of large crossovers cannot do it all. For towing, hauling big loads, maximum passenger capacity and taking off through the rugged wilderness, there are few substitutes for the Ford Expedition.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ford Expedition is a ladder frame full-size SUV that can carry up to nine people. The SUV comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trim levels. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. There’s a longer version called the Expedition EL. It’s about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row of seats. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2009\nFor 2009, the Expedition receives a standard flex-fuel V-8 engine and can get Ford’s Sync voice-activation system.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. At 206.4 inches long and 78.8 inches wide, the Expedition is the longest of the group, though the Tahoe and Sequoia are wider. Regular-length and extended Expeditions sport the same exterior styling. At 221.3 inches long, the Expedition EL is about the same size as the Suburban.\n\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable power liftgate (standard on Limited and King Ranch)\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard power heated mirrors\nOptional rain-sensing wipers (standard on Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to nine occupants across three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor — a feature not offered in all competitors. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional on lower trims and standard on higher ones. With the second- and third-row seats folded, the Expedition’s maximum cargo capacity is 108.3 cubic feet, which is about equal with most of the class, though the Sequoia beats all other competitors by a bit. The Expedition EL offers 130.8 cubic feet of volume, which is just a tad smaller than the Suburban’s space (137.4).\n\nStandard auto-dimming mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nStandard Ford Sync (optional on XLT)\nAutomatic climate control (Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional power-folding third row (optional on XLT)\nOptional GPS navigation system (Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, the Expedition comes only as a half-ton truck. The 2500-series three-quarter-ton Chevys come with larger engines and higher towing and hauling capacities. The sole powertrain is now a flex-fuel system that can run on E85.\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nAvailable rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension system\n\nSafety\nThe Expedition has not been crash tested by our preferred source, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores five stars in government frontal-crash tests, which is the highest rating possible.\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability control with antiroll mitigation\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS-Post Crash Alert System\nAvailable rearview camera (standard on Limited and King Ranch)",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Ford Expedition is a truck-based, full-size SUV that can carry up to eight people. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. A longer version, called the Expedition EL, is about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2012\nSpotter mirrors integrated into the side mirrors to show blind spots are now standard, and Limited and King Ranch models gain standard front park assist.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. Regular- and extended-length Expeditions sport the same exterior styling. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard heated mirrors\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\nOptional 18- or 20-inch wheels\nOptional power liftgate\n\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to eight in three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional. The Expedition EL comes with a cargo organizer that divides the space to suit what is being carried. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional Sync multimedia system\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nOptional power-folding third row\nOptional navigation system\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, which are available with heavy-duty payload ratings, the Expedition comes only as a regular-duty, half-ton truck. The sole powertrain is a flex-fuel engine that can run on E85. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nStandard rear-wheel drive; optional four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension\n\nSafety\nA trailer-sway control feature is standard and works in conjunction with the electronic stability system to detect trailer movement and apply braking, as well as reduce engine torque, to keep the vehicle in control. A standard MyKey system allows parents to impose vehicle restrictions on teen drivers. Parents can limit the vehicle’s top speed, add a persistent seat-belt reminder, limit the volume on the stereo to 44 percent of its maximum volume and have a chime activate at 45, 55 or 65 mph. A backup camera is optional. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system with anti-rollover technology\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTrailer-sway control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2015 Ford Expedition continues almost unchanged from the current model; some powertrain and suspension updates are the big story for this big truck.\nExterior\nChanges for 2015 are limited to some new head- and taillights, the inclusion of LED running lamps and some restyled bumpers. All sheet metal remains the same, there’s a new grille up front and fender trim has been added to the wheel wells. New wheels are offered, with 22-inch wheels optional.\n\nTwo lengths will be offered. The standard Expedition has a 119-inch wheelbase with three rows of seats, offering up to 108.3 cubic feet of cargo room. The long wheelbase Expedition EL spans 131 inches, with a cavernous 130.8 cubic feet of cargo room with the second and third rows folded.\nInterior\nChanges to the interior are minimal as well. The Expedition keeps the old-look Ford truck dash with its last-generation plastics, but adds push-button start, Ford Sync and the latest connectivity abilities. A new 8-inch touch-screen is present in a refreshed console, and new gauges with twin 4.2-inch LCDs are offered.\n\nWhere the Expedition does maintain its advantage is in passenger comfort, thanks to its independent rear suspension, which allows the third row of seats to be folded flat into the floor. This means that the third row is fully usable for real adults, and when stowed it doesn’t eat up a few inches of height like the ones in GM’s SUVs. A new trim level joins the Expedition lineup, the Platinum trim that’s popular on the F-150 pickup truck. It brings upgraded leather in two color choices, Brunello dark red or black, but no real wood trim or upgraded dashboard materials.\nUnder the Hood\nThe biggest changes to the Expedition are where you can’t see them. Front and center is a new powertrain for the truck: The only engine offered will be a new twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic and sending power to the rear wheels. Four-wheel-drive is optional. Ford says that the turbo V-6 should be more powerful and more fuel efficient than the old 5.4-liter V-8 it replaces. No V-8 engine will be available for the Expedition, just like the Navigator.\n\nThe suspension gets some revision as well, with Ford including a new continuously controlled damping system that lets drivers select between Comfort, Normal and Sport modes. The system monitors 46 unique inputs from body sensors, steering, brakes and more to adjust the dampers in milliseconds and create what Ford says will be a far more engaging vehicle to drive.",
