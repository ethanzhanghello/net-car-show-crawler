      "expert_review": "Now that Chevrolet has dropped the Caprice, the oldest car left on the face of the planet must be the Ford Crown Victoria.\n\nThe Crown Vic is a relic from an era when most folks cruised the roadways in rear-wheel-drive vehicles. It’s so old that when it arrived on the scene, there were no mini-vans or sport-utility vehicles.\n\nYet Crown Vic is a survivor. Lots of names have come and gone, but Crown Vic keeps coming back year after year. Fashionable styling and breathtaking performance are not the reasons it keeps making curtain calls. The Crown Vic is a car that pops into mind about the time your locks turn silver. In fact, it’s the sedan you buy when the discount coupons arrive with your monthly AARP magazine.\n\nWhen someone says “They don’t build cars like they used to,” it’s a safe bet the guy owns a Crown Vic.\n\nFor years, the big rear-wheel-drive Ford has justifiably earned a reputation as a very spacious sedan that will transport you and three or four other adults from point A to B with minimal jostling.\n\nCrown Vic has been a big, roomy, four-door sedan with a huge trunk to hold the belongings annually taken to the Florida or Arizona winter retreat.\n\nFord doesn’t boast of any technological breakthroughs because Crown Vic owners don’t expect any. Electronics, to them, means a radio in the dash.\n\nFor the 1998 model year, however, Ford figured it was about time Crown Vic got with the program and delivered more than a smooth, comfy ride that didn’t rattle the dentures.\n\nThe changes to the ’98 are subtle. Call them refinements, starting with a minor cosmetic makeover. The car keeps its conservative design, but smoother front- and rear-end treatment wipes away some of the age lines.\n\nAs with Crown Vic’s cousin, the Mercury Grand Marquis (Cartalk, Nov. 23), the reason to celebrate the car’s ’98 makeover is that the engineers tinkered with the suspension and steering systems to bring them into the modern world.\n\nCrown Vic would get you from Chicago to the wintertime lodge in Florida, but the suspension would rock you all the way there. Older drivers wanted as much sheet metal as possible wrapped around them, but they didn’t like having to fight the wheel to maintain control of the poundage that floated down the road and changed course at the whim of any crosswind.\n\nSo for 1998, Crown Vic gets Precision Trac suspension to eliminate the road wander and give the driver the feeling he is in control. The rear suspension was tweaked for more directional stability. There’s still some float, but only a hint of it because what owners didn’t want to give up was ride softness, which cushioned them from road harshness.\n\nBut Precision Trac wouldn’t provide such a noticeably improved ride without revisions to the steering system to upgrade handling. The engineers eliminated the need to white-knuckle the steering wheel to get the vehicle to respond wh en you choose to move. Crown Vic steering typically hesitated before the ’98 revision.\n\nFord’s description of how the ’98 steering system differs from previous years aptly sums it up: “Turn the wheel in ’97 and the rear end sways, turn the wheel in ’98 and the rear end stays.”\n\nYou enjoy more precise response to steering-wheel input. There’s better steering harmony.\n\nFor optimum ride and handling, you can choose the optional handling and performance package with heavier stabilizer bars, air springs and 16-inch Goodyear all-season radial tires tuned for improved handling and a bit firmer ride.\n\nAfter a few miles on the highway, you may find yourself asking, why doesn’t Taurus grip the road like this?\n\nOur test car came with the standard 4.6-liter, 200-horsepower V-8, but with the handling and performance upgrade ($615), you get dual exhausts for better breathing and therefore a boost to 215 h.p.. Good low-end torque to move off the line when the light changes.\n\nFuel economy isn’t bad at 17 miles per gallon city/24 highway. And as has become common on Fords, an arrow on the fuel gauge in the dash points to which side the fill nozzle is on to keep you from pulling up on the wrong side at the pump. Nice touch, especially in multiple-car households.\n\nA 4-speed automatic is standard, and Ford tinkered with it to come up with smoother shift points.\n\nSome noteworthy features include placement of the rear-window defroster button within easy reach on the dash; an easier-to-see digital speedometer and large easier-to-use control knobs for older drivers; fold-down center armrests for driver/passenger to provide comfort on long-distance travel; outside temperature reading; large outside mirrors for good side and rear field of vision; and the power trunk open button conveniently located in the driver’s door.\n\nThere are a few annoyances, however, one being the driver’s information center that, among other things, gives you a continuous digital reading of your fuel economy. Since the mileage reading can zoom from 70 m.p.g. when cruising to 10 m.p.g. when accelerating to pass, it is a toy that drives you to distraction if you focus on it for any length of time.\n\nThe other gripe is a traditional one at Ford Motor Co. While Chicago is the founder of the deep-dish pizza, Ford takes credit (?) for the deep-dish trunk. The trunk is very deep, but deep isn’t all that practical when you surround that hole with a wide ledge so the only things that fit in the hole are beach balls and pillows. When golf clubs are shaped like boomerangs, the deep-dish Ford trunk will prove handy. Until then, a flat floor would be welcome.\n\nThe Crown Vic starts at $23,135. Standard equipment includes dual air bags, childproof rear-door locks, remote keyless entry, speed-sensitive power steering, four-wheel power disc brakes, solar tinted glass, dual power mirrors, air conditioning, power windows and locks, tilt steering, automatic on/off headlamps and 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nThe price swells by $2,200 when you convert it to the more lavish LX edition by adding a package that includes ABS and traction control for all-season motoring in a larger rear-wheel-drive sedan along with power seats, automatic climate control and a premium sound system. Leather seats will run you $735. Our test car came with a dark blue leather interior that looked very drab and will show every dirt and dust mark. Those are the reasons we’d stick with cloth.\n\n>> 1998 Crown Victoria LX Wheelbase: 114.7 inches Length: 212 inches Engine: 4.6-liter, 215-h.p. V-8 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 17 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway Base price: $23,135 Price as tested: $26,740. Includes $2,200 for LX package with ABS wit h traction control, dual six-way power seats, leather-wrapped wheel, automatic climate control, premium AM/FM stereo with cassette, electronic instrumentation and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels; $615 for handling and performance package with 16-inch all-season radials; $55 for front and rear floor mats; and $735 for leather seats. Add $605 for freight. Pluses: Huge interior room. Controls easy to see and use. ABS and traction control for all-season motoring. Fairly friendly suspension. Minuses: Conservative styling. Deep-dish trunk design is fine if golf clubs were round or you haul a hot tub. >>",

      "expert_review": "`Few extra gray hairs pop out this morning, Padre?” Twin No. 1 asked.\n\n“Earned each and every one,” we replied with a smile.\n\n“Were you holdin’ the handrail goin’ down the stairs this morning?” offered Twin No. 2.\n\n“Can never be too careful,” we noted with a grin.\n\n“Sit down at the table, your pureed cereal is ready,” cooed the wife.\n\n“Soft food is good for the digestion,” we beamed. “By the way, anyone seen my AARP newsletter?”\n\nJust another birthday. No cause for alarm. Sure the trips to the bathroom are more frequent but age isn’t measured only by how you feel or the number of notches added to the belt, but by how others perceive you look and feel.\n\n“Oh, almost forgot,” Twin No. 1 interjected. “A car was left for you this morning-a Ford Crown Victoria. If you want to drive it, I’ll toss on the antique plates.”\n\n“Yikes!!!” we screamed as we jumped up from the breakfast nook and knocked over the diuretics, vitamins A through D, kelp capsules and the tube of Ben-Gay.\n\n“If you want to see the car, I’ll get your walker or do you feel frisky today and want to make do with only your cane?” Twin No. 1 chuckled.\n\nSuddenly the hair felt gray, the bones brittle, the eyes foggy, the ears plugged and the bladder full.\n\nA Ford Crown Victoria. The car Methuselah tooled around in. The retirement village sedan of choice. The vehicle preferred by those with a blue hue to their hair and 24 Visa payments left on their teeth.\n\nIt had come to this.\n\nFord Motor Co., the outfit with the best-selling car (Taurus) and truck (F-Series) and sport-utility vehicle (Explorer) still turns out one of the oldest vehicles known to man-a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nCops, cabbies and coupon clippers are the customers for what has become a sensible sedan, Ford’s version of the Chevrolet Caprice-Mrs. Methuselah’s car.\n\nStill, since the first pension check won’t arrive for a few more years, we opted to test the 1995 Crown Vic LX, a rear-wheel-drive relic in an age of front-wheel-drive, a car whose claim to fame is that it can still tow a boat.\n\nHave to admit that the buggy has grown old rather gracefully. Styling is ultra-conservative-meaning bleak-though grille, bumpers and taillamps got revised cosmetic treatment for ’95. But the sedan still has some spring to its step thanks to the addition of a 4.6-liter, 190-horsepower, V-8 teamed with 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nDon’t underestimate the allure of a V-8 to 60-something buyers who grew up learning that bigger is better, a V-6 is a toy and a 4-cylinder a joke. Detroit builds 6s and 4s; God built the V-8-on the seventh day while He was resting.\n\nThese are the same people who were teethed on rear-wheel-drive and still resist accepting front-wheel-drive as anything other than a gimmick. They may never tow that boa t and seldom venture into the passing lane, but they want the satisfaction of knowing that if they did, there would be power in reserve.\n\nThe price you pay for the V-8 is frequent stops at the pump. The 4.6 is generously rated at 17 miles per gallon city/25 m.p.g. highway. We say “generous” because over a week, we found the fuel gauge needle moves much more briskly than most Crown Vic owners.\n\nAnother advantage of the Crown Vic is roominess. It will hold five to six adults. That trio in back might be squeezed a tad, but not packed like sardines as they would be in the smaller Taurus.\n\nAnd the trunk is spacious. Pack it with golf clubs or luggage, perhaps both. Our only gripe is that the Crown Vic holds to the deep dish trunk design, which means it holds a lot, but you have to bend over a lot to put items in and get them out. Then again, that’s what the kelp capsules are for.\n\nThe main attraction of the car for those up a bit in yearsi that it offers all the safety goodies-dual air bags, anti-lock brakes and traction control. But, though the air cushions are standard, ABS and traction control cost extra.\n\nWhen you order ABS, traction control comes with the system. The argument over FWD versus RWD focuses on vehicle stability and traction on wet or snowy roads. With ABS and traction control in a RWD car, the argument is a bit moot.\n\nBut, in our test car the ABS/TC systems were part of a $4,395 package that included memory seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and automatic dimming mirror-items that contribute far more to the well-being of the automaker’s financial statement than the peace and joy of the motorist.\n\nFor $665 you can buy ABS/TC as a free-standing option. ABS/TC should be the first box you check when ordering this car, because the two could prevent the air bag from having to deploy.\n\nBut there is a gripe over the ABS/TC system. Ford fails to acknowledge the two with dash lights or wording.\n\n“We apply a badge when we want to call attention to a different or exclusive benefit, such as a V-8 badge on the Thunderbird because the rest of the cars in that segment offer V-6s,” a Ford spokesman said. “A badge for ABS/TC wasn’t considered on the Crown Vic.”\n\nShame on Ford. Such wording would remind motorists that they have the added insurance of ABS/TC. Also, unless you save the window sticker listing standard and optional equipment, the second or third owner is going to have to take someone’s word that the vehicle has added value from those systems.\n\nIf Ford can provide an arrow in the dash informing the motorist what side the gas tank door is on so that he or she doesn’t pull up to the wrong pump, you’d think the automaker could spend a couple of more pennies to tell any and all that ABS/TC is available for their protection.\n\nBase price of the Crown Vic LX we tested is $21,970.\n\nStandard equipment includes all-season radial tires, deluxe wheel covers, dual remote power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, dual cupholders, air conditioning, power windows, speed-sensitive power steering, nitrogen gas-pressurized shocks, childproof rear door locks and four-wheel power disc brakes.\n\nYou’ll want to add ABS/TC at $665, the handling suspension at $410, which reduces lean or sway in corners and bouncing and jostling on the straightaways, but should take a pass on leather seats and save the $530.\n\nChanges for 1995 include moving power seat controls to the door panel from the seat and adding heated sideview mirrors as standard, rear seat ducts for faster rear-compartment warmup, solar-tinted windshield and rear glass for improved interior cooling and a “battery saver” that turns off lamps after 10 minutes if the lights have been left on.\n\nAlso, the decklid is aluminum to save 19 pounds, the previously optional rear window defroster is sta ndard and a power plug has been added near the floor heat register to handle 12-volt accessories, such as cellular phones.\n\nOptions deleted include the cellular phone system, compact disc changer and power antenna, which was replaced by an antenna hidden in the rear window.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNew dual-stage front airbags, more horsepower and optional power-adjustable pedals are fresh features for the Crown Victoria, a traditional V-8-powered, rear-drive family sedan with body-on-frame construction.\n\nThe new front airbags deploy at one of two inflation levels based on crash severity, whether the seat belts are buckled and the position of the drivers seat. The airbags may not deploy in less-severe crashes if sensors detect that the seat belts are buckled.\n\nAlso new for 2001 is a feature that automatically turns on the headlights when the windshield wipers are activated. The Crown Victoria is a corporate twin to the Mercury Grand Marquis. While about two-thirds of Crown Victoria sales go to police squads and taxicab companies, most of the Grand Marquis sales are to retail buyers. Restyled versions of both are expected for the 2002 model year but will retain their current mechanical design.\n\nThe Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis are built on the same rear-drive platform as the Lincoln Town Car, which has different styling and larger dimensions. The separate body-chassis design dates to the 1979 Ford LTD.\n\nExterior\nThe conservatively tailored Crown Vic has a 114.7-inch wheelbase and is 212 inches long overall  a foot longer than the Buick LeSabre, a front-drive rival and the most popular full-size car. Styling is the same as that on the Grand Marquis except for a different grille, taillamps and exterior trim.\n\nInterior\nTall, wide doors allow easy entry and exit, and with bench seats in the front and rear, the Crown Vic holds six people. Middle passengers, however, have to straddle a large driveshaft tunnel and dont get the same cushy seating as outboard occupants. The front seat is a split bench with a folding center armrest.\n\nThe new power-adjustable pedals, a feature previously offered on other Ford vehicles, have a 3-inch range.\n\nCargo volume is a cavernous 20.6 cubic feet, though much of it is in a deep well that is awkward to reach.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard engine is a 4.6-liter V-8 with 220 horsepower, 20 hp more than last year. An optional handling package includes a firmer suspension, touring tires and a dual exhaust system that boosts horsepower to 235 (also 20 hp more than last year).\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission is standard, and antilock brakes and traction control are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSeveral full-size, front-drive sedans offer as much room or more and similar acceleration with more economical V-6 engines, and they come wrapped in more contemporary styling. The Crown Vic and Grand Marquis, however, offer rear-drive traditionalists a solid and capable alternative that is more reasonably priced than some front-drive rivals.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "I was an old man for a week, and I loved it. That’s “old,” not “middle-aged.” I’m talking 65 to 75 years, not 45 to 55. I’m talking geezer, curmudgeon, grouch, don’t-have-to-listen-to-you because-I’ve-heard-it-all-before.\n\nI had a good time.\n\nIt happened in a 2002 Ford Crown Victoria LX sedan. It’s a big, conservative American car favored by police, government agents and senior citizens. It gets respect.\n\nPeople move out of the way of a Crown Vic. If they’re speeding, they slow down. Nobody cuts you off.\n\nAnother thing: At a Giant Food store in Northern Virginia, one motorist allowed me to take a regular parking spot closest to the store. She was very nice about it. Maybe she thought I was a detective, or maybe an Internal Revenue Service agent. Maybe she thought I as an old guy in a Crown Vic who needed a break.\n\nNo matter. It felt good. I once wrote a column about being treated like royalty in a Rolls-Royce Corniche. But that was deference stemming from envy and, perhaps, a mixture of lust and greed.\n\nThe Crown Vic engenders something else. If you’re sitting behind its wheel in coat and tie, people assume that you’re on a mission. Why else would you be driving an “Arizona Beige clearcoat metallic” govmobile that stretches 17.7 feet front to rear? Why else would you be in a car that could seat six large adults in perfect comfort?\n\nIf you’re in casual wear, as I was on the day the nice woman helped me at the Giant, younger people treat you as their father, village elder, someone in need of and deserving of assistance.\n\nThere is something so establishment about the Crown Vic, other motorists assume that you’re going to do the right thing behind the wheel. I’m often nervous when slowing down for yellow lights. I fear that drivers speeding behind me will smash my rear. But in the Crown Vic, I checked the rearview mirror and noticed that traffic was slowing in anticipation of my stopping at yellow.\n\nIt’s easy to make fun of this car. Its dashboard is long and wide enough to host a soccer game. Despite a variety of cosmetic fixes, the rest of the interior is old-school — big cloth-covered or leather seats, depending on your preference; lots of woodgrain inserts, plush-pile carpeting.\n\nThe car also is traditional mechanically — rear-wheel drive; a 4.6-liter, 220-horsepower, two-valves-per-cylinder pushrod V-8 engine; and, of course, a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nRival automobiles, such as the Toyota Avalon sedan, have more pizazz and prestige. But the Crown Vic trumps most of them in terms of value for dollar and overall safety.\n\nI’m going to miss this car. It carried me well on my tours of Northern Virginia. It was as great at rest stops as it was on the highway. I’d pull over at patrolled rest stops, turn off the engine, crack the windows, check the door locks, and quite literally stretch out and nap on its sp acious rear seat.\n\nAnd it didn’t matter when I got up a bit rumpled and ambled to the men’s room to clean up before hitting the road, again. I was just an old guy, probably a nice old guy, traveling around Virginia.",

      "expert_review": "Police forces traditionally have favored big, affordable, rear-drive V-8 sedans. There’s a lot of room in them for felons and doughnuts, and they have enough power to catch most of the bad guys.\n\nAlas, the years have not been kind to the sub-luxury subspecies of Gigantis Reardrivicus. Chrysler stopped building one back in the ’80s. The Chevy Caprice tossed in its greasy towel in the mid-’90s.\n\nThat leaves the Ford Crown Victoria to reign alone as – a flourish of clarions here – America’s police car.\n\n“The Crown Vic has sales of between 110,000 and 120,000 a year, and 50 to 60 percent of those are for police car service,” reports George Pipas, a Ford sales analyst.\n\nThe Crown Vic Police Interceptor model accounts for 85 percent of the cars sold for use as police pursuit vehicles in the United States and Canada, according to Ford.\n\nActually, the Crown Vic is not just beloved by the gendarmes. It also has a mature fan club that appreciates a powerful, roomy, comfortable car that can tow a lot – and does not make its clientele float a bond to buy it.\n\nConsider: The Crown Vic starts at $22,100. The well-equipped, top-of-the-line LX model that I tested was base-priced at $24,120. Even after the PR operatives got out there with pitchforks and loaded it up with just about every available option, the Vic weighed in at $28,215, including shipping.\n\nIt had been a while since I was in America’s police car, and frankly, I did not expect to be impressed.\n\nI was. The test car proved lively and athletic for a two-ton sedan.\n\nPart of that engine zip and cornering competence was courtesy of an optional handling and engine performance package. In addition to replacing the standard, 16-inch steel rims with some handsome alloy ones, this inexpensive ($615) package tweaks the Vic in a number of ways.\n\nThe package’s dual exhausts raise the horsepower rating of the car’s gutsy, 4.6-liter V-8 from 200 to 215. A lower differential ratio further boosts acceleration.\n\nTo improve handling, the package equips the car with performance tires, and stiffens the suspension with bigger stabilizer bars, revised shock absorbers, and rear air springs, which also provide automatic load leveling. (About the only performance-oriented hardware that does not get massaged is the braking system. With huge standard discs at all four corners, it does not need any.)\n\nThe net result is a big, old sedan that addresses the corners in an unexpectedly flat and composed manner – and does not exact a hard-ride trade-off.\n\nIn addition to performing nicely, the Crown Vic is comfortable company. It easily seats six in its quiet cabin, and provides them with plenty of room for their luggage in its cavernous trunk.\n\nFord has been making the Crown Vic for a long time, and it shows. It shows in the way it is screwed together, and in the small amount of aggravation it causes its customers. (It was among J.D. Power & Associa tes’ top 10 quality vehicles last year.)\n\nGas mileage is pretty good for a car that weighs this much. The Crown Vic has EPA mileage ratings of 18 m.p.g. city and 25 highway. I got 19.8 in mixed driving.\n\nThe Crown Vic, finally, is not a sports car, but acquits itself surprisingly well in the performance department, particularly when fitted with the handling package. It is not a beautiful car, but it has a certain utilitarian dignity.\n\nWhat it is is a large, strong, durable automobile that can tow boats and campers, and carry a lot of friends (or felons) and doughnuts.\n\n* * *\n\nBase model:Rear-drive, 4.6-liter V-8, four-speed automatic transmission, 16-inch steel wheels, P225/60R16 all-season radials, power brakes, antilock braking system, speed-sensitive power steering, dual air bags, air-conditioning, power doors with keyless entry, power windows, power mirrors, power driver’s seat, tilt steering, intermittent wipers, rear window defrosters.\n\nTest model: Traction control, floor mats, full-size spare tire, premium sound system with trunk-mounted CD changer, engine performance and handling package, power passenger’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, climate control system, leather seats.\n\nBase price: $24,120\n\nTest price: $28,215 (inc. shipping)\n\nEPA city mileage: 18 m.p.g.\n\nTest mileage: 19.8 m.p.g.\n\nWarranty: Three years/36,000 miles bumper to bumper.",

      "expert_review": "Last year, an Oklahoma writer named John Hiner wrote a book called The Car I Couldn’t Wear Out. That car: A 2003 Ford Crown Victoria had, at the time, 465,015 miles. He replaced a wheel bearing at 110,000 miles, but never even changed the spark plugs.\nI don’t know if Hiner needs a new Crown Victoria, but if he does, he’d best act now. Some Ford dealers have a handful of 2007 Crown Victorias left, and others are already sold out. There will be no more.\nNot for us civilians, at least: Ford will still market a basic Crown Victoria to police and taxicab fleets. And Mercury will continue to sell the Crown Vic’s cousin, the Grand Marquis, for another year or so. But with the end of this model year, there will be no more retail Crown Vics. Ford is so anxious to distance itself from the Crown Victoria’s decades of service that the company has already broomed the car from its official consumer Web site.\nAll this makes me a little sad. The Crown Victoria is a legitimate dinosaur, a soon-to-be-missing link connected to the way they used to build cars: V-8 engine up front, driving the wheels in the back, big four-door body bolted to a separate frame.\nEssentially unchanged since its last major redesign — in 1992! — the 2007 Crown Victoria is, nonetheless, updated with some moderately recent technology. The LX test car had traction control, power adjustable pedals and side airbags, all options. The price: $30,860. But suffice to say you could do a whole lot better than that.\nUnder the hood is the 4.6-liter, 224-horsepower V-8. Feel free to go looking for one of those high-powered Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models, but they only have 239 horsepower, 11 fewer than a Kia minivan.\nBut the good news is that when your V-8 is pumping out only 224 horses, it’s so understressed that these engines tend to run for, well, a long time. The four-speed automatic transmission shifts grudgingly — this whole car feels as if it’s ready for a siesta. The energy it’s conserving translates into mediocre fuel mileage, an EPA-rated 17 miles per gallon city, 25 mpg highway, and regular is fine, thanks. This engine would probably run on lighter fluid. It does, in fact, run on E85 ethanol.\nThe Crown Victoria LX’s suspension is built for comfort. Drive too fast into a corner and you get substantial body roll, punctuated with squeals from the 16-inch radial tires. But on the highway, this is a pretty comfortable car, though the rigid rear axle tends to be alarmed by potholes.\nThere are, of course, much more technologically up-to-date big cars, but I respect the single-minded honesty of this big beast — it’s built to go, and go, and go, and now that it’s almost gone, I’ll miss it.",

      "expert_review": "You can call the Ford Crown Victoria stodgy and boring, and you won’t get much argument from me.\n\nIn fact, I have this irrational fear that using the words “sport sedan” and “Crown Victoria” in the same sentence could cause my computer to crash. (OK, I got away with it this time.)\n\nBut what I don’t want to hear in connection with this grand old American traditional is a lot of guff about gas-guzzling dinosaurs. Not in a marketplace dominated by sport-utility vehicles.\n\nSure, the Crown Vic weighs in pretty close to the two-ton frontier, and its agility is some distance from best among full-size sedans.\n\nBut compared with most sport-utilities, the Crown Vic is a lightweight, with the agility of a halfback. And its fuel economy — 17 m.p.g. city, 24 highway, according to EPA projections, just more than 22 in my week with a test car — puts those same sport-utilities to shame.\n\nIf you’re still wondering why a car like this persists, here’s why: It’s big, it’s roomy, it’s rugged, it’s quiet, it’s smooth, and if it doesn’t offer much in the way of driver involvement, well, that’s just exactly what its drivers covet — full-size, traditional American transportation almost undiluted from a carefree era.\n\nIncidentally, the word traditional goes even deeper here than you may think.\n\nThe Victoria name goes way back in Ford model history, at least to 1930, and in another sense it actually predates the advent of the automobile itself. Before self-propelled buggies began wobbling around on public roads, a Victoria was an open horse-drawn carriage for two.\n\nThe first Ford Crown Victoria, as nearly as I can tell, came along in 1955, which was when the domestic industry was embarking on the golden age of fins, chrome and uninhibited color combinations.\n\nMaybe you remember it. It was a two-door model then, with a chrome tiara, or crown, spanning the roof amidships. Garish, but nevertheless right in step with its times.\n\nAs a kid, I loved its looks, and I remember a sense of outrage when one of the older guys I knew managed to drive his Vicky, as we called it, into a pressure ridge in the Lake Minnetonka ice at a pretty high rate of speed.\n\nUnderstand, this was Minnesota in midwinter. The ice was thick, and during January and February we all drove our cars on the lake.\n\nBut we were savvy enough to avoid pressure ridges, which were caused by the constant expansion of the ice as it froze. With no water underneath, the ice wouldn’t support the weight of a car, and plook, the Vicky broke through and bubbled some 40 feet to the bottom, the owner safely jumping ship before she sank.\n\nObviously, the Crown Vic of today doesn’t have much in common with the one that did that Titanic act back in ’55.\n\nChrome is out, ditto Easter egg two-tone color schemes, a modern overhead cam V8 has replaced the old push-rod version, and the standards for handling and stopping have improved by a whole o rder of magnitude.\n\nOn the other hand, there are ties with that earlier age that you just won’t find outside the Ford Motor Co.\n\nUnique design\n\nSpecifically, the Crown Victoria is one of the very few passenger cars whose body and frame are separate units. The others are the Mercury Grand Marquis, essentially the same car with slightly different trim, and the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nAlthough body-on-frame yields slightly higher curb weights than the near-universal unitbody approach — where the frame rails are integrated with the body shell — it can be more durable.\n\nYou might wind up with a few more squeaks and rattles over the years, but you’ll also have a car that’s capable of absorbing a real pounding.\n\nThat’s why all pickup trucks are body-on-frame designs.\n\nIt’s also a key reason the Crown Vic is so popular for uses that require exceptional durability.\n\nThe New York City taxi fleet, for example. Or police cars.\n\nThat last i an important element in the Crown Vic’s survival.\n\nWith the demise of the Chevrolet Caprice, the Crown Vic has become America’s cop car, claiming 85 percent of police-related sales in North America, according to Ford.\n\nWhat the police want and need for their demanding duties is a big, rear-wheel-drive sedan with reasonable power, good handling, and lots of room, including a big trunk for all the emergency gear police officers have to lug around.\n\nThe Crown Vic is roomy enough inside, with seating for six, and enough space in back for three adults to sit comfortably, even when they happen to be wearing handcuffs.\n\nThe trunk in my test car, however, was compromised by the spare tire, one of those temporary ones, which sits atop a shelf that rises out of the depths about halfway into the trunk.\n\nAs you’d expect, police organizations also need stiffer suspension components for emergency activities that require first-rate handling.\n\nNo argument there, but I really wish Ford would make the same stuff available to ordinary Crown Vic customers.\n\nDespite upgrades to the suspension last year, and a $615 handling and performance package (slightly firmer springs and 215 horsepower, versus 200 for the standard Crown Vic), my test car’s handling responses were not what you’d call knife-edged — unless you happened to be comparing them with, say, a Ford Expedition, or others of that ilk.\n\nAnd its steering, though improved in that same update, is still pretty much devoid of any tactile information about what the front wheels are doing.\n\nAnd like some other recent Ford products, the Crown Vic rates five stars — the top mark — from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its ability to protect the driver and front-seat passengers in head-on impacts.\n\nInterior flaws\n\nInside, the Crown Vic is move-around roomy and reasonably comfortable — if you like seats that are devoid of any lateral support.\n\nFord has installed climate and audio controls that are operable even with gloved hands, and the sound quality was excellent. But the monochromatic appearance of the interior in my test car, a uniformly funereal blue, was just flat dreary.\n\nMy test car was also equipped with a digital speedometer, part of a $2,150 option package that included leather, a premium AM-FM-cassette sound system, power seat controls, automatic climate controls, and 16-inch aluminum alloy wheels.\n\nI hate digital speedometers, partly because they don’t give a good sense of how fast you’re accelerating. But I suppose for drivers who aren’t in a hurry they’re just fine.\n\nAfter all, that’s what the Crown Vic is all about. Relaxed transportation that’s short on flash and long on durability, with the bonus, for some, of rear-wheel drive.\n\nIt seems to me that Ford could broaden the Crown Victoria’s appeal by making elements of its police car package available to civilians, as Chevrolet d id with the Impala SS a few years back.\n\nBut even without that enticement, it’s clear that there’s still a place for the Crown Victoria and its Mercury sister in this market.\n\nIt’s also clear that Ford is doing a pretty good job of keeping this all-American tradition on the road. Long may it live.\n\nSPECS\n\nRating: 3\n\nVehicle type: Front-engine, rear-drive full-size sedan\n\nKey competitors: Buick LeSabre, Dodge Intrepid, Pontiac Bonneville\n\nBase price: $24,530\n\nAs tested: $27,525\n\nStandard equipment: Antilock brakes, four-speed automatic transmission, air-conditioning, AM-FM-cassette audio, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, tilt steering\n\nSpecifications:\n\n(manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine: 215-horsepower 4.6-liter V8\nEPA fuel economy: 17 m.p.g. city, 24 hwy.\nCurb weight: 3,917 pounds\nWheelbase: 114.7 inches Length: 212 inches\nWidth: 78.2 inches\nHeight: 56.8 inches\nWhere assembled: St. Thomas, Canada",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s traditional full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan saw only modest changes for the 2006 model year. An in-glass antenna replaces the former mast, and a perimeter alarm is newly optional. New nine-spoke 16-inch wheels go on LX models, and a trip computer is standard on LX and LX Sport sedans. All Crown Victorias are powered by a 4.6-liter V-8.\n\nBuilt in Canada, Ford’s biggest sedan has earned five-star ratings for both front occupants in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration frontal-impact crash tests. Mercury offers the similar Grand Marquis with additional features and a higher price. These two are the last remaining examples of moderately priced, rear-drive, full-size sedans.\n\nThe Crown Victoria is offered in Standard, LX and LX Sport trim levels. An LX Premier Group option package incorporates certain features of the LX Sport. Heavy-duty Crown Victorias for police and taxi use come in standard or extended-wheelbase form.\n\nExterior\nStyling features include wide door openings, wraparound aero headlights and color-keyed bodyside moldings. Riding a 114.6-inch wheelbase, the four-door sedan is 212 inches long overall and 58.3 inches tall.\n\nStandard wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but the LX Sport sedan gets 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels, a Handling and Performance package and a monochromatic exterior. Automatic-leveling rear air springs are installed on the LX Sport.\n\nInterior\nFive or six people fit inside the Crown Victoria, depending on whether a bench or bucket seats are installed up front. Standard and LX models feature the front bench for a six-person capacity. An overhead console is standard in the LX and LX Sport models. The sedan’s trunk holds 20.6 cubic feet of cargo, and a trunk organizer is offered as an option. A power moonroof is optional on the LX and LX Sport models.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt steering column, a cassette stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Remote keyless entry, electronic climate control and a CD stereo are installed in the LX sedan. The LX Sport adds a cassette/CD stereo, leather-trimmed power bucket seats, a floor-mounted gearshift lever and a full-length center console. Power-adjustable pedals are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn Standard and LX trims, the Crown Victoria’s 4.6-liter V-8 produces 224 horsepower and 272 pounds-feet of torque and drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. Optional all-speed traction control uses the antilock braking system and throttle intervention to manage wheelspin. A more potent 239-hp version of the V-8, featuring a dual exhaust system, is standard in the LX Sport.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. A dual-rate brake booster applies full braking power automatically in a panic stop. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough the past two model years have seen the introduction of other rear-drive models, relatively few choices are available for drivers who seek rear-drive motoring at a moderate cost. Fortunately, the Crown Vic yields a generally pleasant experience, led by an easygoing ride. As long as you don’t expect sharp handling, this sedan can be a sensible purchase, though it’s bigger than most people need.",

      "expert_review": "Finding an alternative-fuel vehicle can be as difficult as ordering a vegetarian entree in a Kansas City steak house. And that may bother you, especially if you’re worried about smog, global warming or the fact that U.S. cars and trucks burn 240,000 gallons of gasoline every minute.\n\nOh, sure, General Motors is bringing out the EV1, its first production electric car, in the fall, but you won’t be able to buy it or service it unless you live in California or Arizona.\n\nThat’s why we were so excited to test-drive the 1996 Ford Crown Victoria NGV (for “natural gas vehicle”). It’s an interesting alternative in a gasoline-powered marketplace, but be forewarned – you’re going to feel like a pioneer if you buy one.\n\nHe: So tell me what the big deal is here. You jump in the car, turn the key, fire up the engine and away you go. I love Crown Vics anyway, but unless you lifted the trunk lid or ran out of fuel, you’d be hard-pressed to tell much difference between the natural-gas model and the garden-variety Crown Vic.\n\nShe: That’s what makes it so great. You get the same rumble and roar that you do with the conventional gas engine, and you don’t really sacrifice anything in terms of fuel economy. The two biggest problems are range and availability of fuel. Plus there are some subtle price wars going on.\n\nHe: I’m not even sure where I’d go to refuel a natural-gas car, or how much it would cost. Those would be the biggest potential bugaboos to me.\n\nShe: In the Detroit area, we’ll have at least four natural-gas refueling stations by the end of August. There are 25 altogether in Michigan, including some high-traffic locations like the Meijer store in Jackson. Now you can’t be an airhead about this type of vehicle. You’ve got to know that you only get about 240 to 250 miles on a tankful – about 100 miles less than in a conventional Crown Vic.\n\nHe: That’s still a lot better, by a factor of two or three, than the range on the typical electric cars that are beginning to hit the streets. Plus you get the roominess of the Crown Vic, which is still one of the biggest cars on the road. Considering it weighs nearly 2 tons and can carry up to six adults, that’s not bad mileage. It will get you from Detroit to Lansing and back on a tankful.\n\nShe: I was worried about the price of natural gas and how it compares with regular gasoline, partly because natural gas prices are all over the map right now, depending on which station you go to. The ones controlled by MichCon, our local gas company, tend to run about 80 cents a gallon. Independent gas station owners want the price to be more in line with regular gasoline, and they’re pricing it around 93 cents a gallon. But I have good news for consumers: You can buy a $3,000 “fuel maker” from MichCon that hooks up to your natural-gas line at home and you can fill up overnight for about 30-40 cents a gallon. There’s always a way around roadblocks like this, especially if you’re an e nvironmental activist.\n\nHe: I would have never guessed you were a closet tree-hugger.\n\nShe: Well, I’ve come out of the closet today. But it wasn’t easy. Because I had real safety fears about a natural-gas vehicle. I was worried about the tanks blowing up. And I was worried about whether I’d have to stick a carbon-monoxide detector on the dash. Turns out my worries are unfounded.\n\nHe: You clearly never saw the movie “Dr. Strangelove,” did you? Remember the subtitle – “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.”\n\nShe: I didn’t need to see the movie. But it helped to talk to the MichCon people. They said it would be pretty hard to hurt the natural-gas tanks. The federal government has dropped them from airplanes, run them over with bulldozers, shot at them and thrown them in fires, and they’re fairly impervious to abuse. Also, unlike regular gasoline, natural gas is lighter than air and vents into the atmosphere, so there is little danger from lingering fum If you want to know the truth, one of my disappointments is here’s this environmentally hip package in an old fogy’s car.\n\nHe: Oh, I’m really hurt. You know I’ve always been fond of the Crown Vic.\n\nShe: You also still like Burger King Whoppers, and they’re not politically correct either.\n\nHe: Some people like that extra sense of security they get from having all that sheet metal around them, and they like the power of the overhead-cam V-8, which doesn’t lose much in the conversion to natural gas. It still makes 178 horsepower, compared with 190 for the regular engine. And Ford has done a nice job of tuning the car’s rear-wheel-drive chassis, which is supple without feeling marshmallowy. The steering is surprisingly responsive, and you also get loads of standard equipment, all for under $25,000. My biggest gripe is that antilock brakes and traction control, which are must-have features on the Crown Vic, cost an extra $670.\n\nShe: If you’re still wondering why Ford decided to start putting natural-gas engines in Crown Vics, it was initially aimed at police and utility fleets. The city of Wixom, where Ford builds most of its big Lincolns, is running most of its Ford cop cars on natural gas. However, by the end of the summer, consumers will be able to buy a natural-gas-powered Ford Contour. That package should be easier to market to environmentally conscious yuppies. To say nothing of the fact that you can also get a natural-gas Chrysler minivan.\n\nHe: Somehow I can’t picture Peter Sellers or Slim Pickens driving a minivan.\n\nShe: I couldn’t imagine myself driving any kind of a natural-gas vehicle either. But it’s beginning to make more and more sense. Natural gas is made in America – 95 percent of the natural gas used in the United States comes from the United States. And can you imagine if we all made the switch? There’d be none of this talk about defending our oil-related military interests overseas.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s traditional, full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan got a new full-perimeter frame and some major upgrades in ride, comfort, safety, and steering and handling for 2003. Rack-and-pinion steering replaced the Crown Victoria’s old recirculating-ball system, and the sizable sedan’s turning circle was reduced by a foot.\n\nOther than one new color and a newly available six-CD changer, little has changed for 2005. The Crown Victoria features a 4.6-liter V-8, and a power moonroof is optional on LX and LX Sport models for 2005.\n\nThe sedan earned five-star ratings for both front occupants in NHTSA frontal-impact crash tests. Mercury offers a similar Grand Marquis sedan with additional features and a higher price.\n\nThe Crown Victoria is offered in Standard, LX and LX Sport trim levels, along with an LX Premier Group option package that incorporates some of the features of the LX Sport.\n\nExterior\nStyling features include wide door openings, wraparound aero headlights and color-keyed bodyside moldings. Riding a 114.7-inch wheelbase, the four-door sedan is 212 inches long overall and 58.3 inches tall.\n\nStandard tires measure 16 inches in diameter, but the LX Sport sedan gets 17-inchers on aluminum wheels and a monochromatic exterior. Automatic-leveling rear air springs are available.\n\nInterior\nFive or six people fit inside the Crown Victoria, depending on whether a bench or bucket seats are installed up front. Standard and LX models feature the front bench seat. An overhead console is standard in the LX and LX Sport models. The sedan’s trunk holds 20.6 cubic feet of cargo, and a trunk organizer is offered as an option.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt steering column, a cassette stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. All Crown Victorias except the base model have a door-mounted keyless-entry pad. Remote keyless entry and a CD stereo are installed in the LX sedan. The LX Sport adds a cassette/CD stereo, electronic climate control, a floor-mounted gearshift lever and a full-length center console.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn Standard and LX trims, the Crown Victoria’s 4.6-liter V-8 produces 224 horsepower and 272 pounds-feet of torque and drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. Optional all-speed traction control uses the antilock braking system and throttle intervention to manage wheelspin. A more potent 239-hp version of the V-8, featuring a dual exhaust system, is standard in the LX Sport.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. A dual-rate brake booster applies full braking power automatically in a panic stop. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough 2005 has seen the introduction of other rear-drive models, relatively few choices are available for drivers who seek rear-drive motoring at a moderate cost. Fortunately, the Crown Vic yields a generally pleasant experience, led by an easygoing ride. As long as you don’t expect sharp handling, this sedan can be a sensible purchase, but it’s bigger than most people need.",

      "expert_review": "IT’S AN OLD runner with a new heart, a 1992 Ford Crown Victoria with a gas engine — natural gas, compressed.\n\nIt’s “clean-burning natural gas,” the kind proponents see as an alternative to dirtier burning gasoline.\n\nThe gas Vic is part of a three-year test conducted by Ford and 20 utility companies nationwide, including Washington Gas. The idea is to gather real-world data on the use, durability and reliability of natural-gas cars under many conditions.\n\nThere are 41 experimental Ford gassers. I ran mine for a week before almost running into trouble. I forgot about traffic jams, which is a no-no in compressed natural gas vehicles.\n\nUnlike gasoline, which must be converted from liquid to vapor before being mixed with air and made ready for combustion, natural gas is, well, already gas. It comes ready to mix and burn, which creates a delightful yet troublesome efficiency in the internal combustion engine.\n\nThe delight is performance. You want fast? Use natural gas.\n\nThe trouble is mileage. Natural gas burns at a higher temperature than gasoline. But it burns faster, especially, it seems, when the gas car is sitting and baking in traffic.\n\nFor example, the gasoline-powered 1992 Crown Vic with a 20-gallon tank, four-speed automatic transmission and 4.6-liter V-8 gets about 24 miles per gallon on the highway. That’s a possible range of 480 miles between fills, based on my real-world experience with that car.\n\nThe comparable natural-gas Vic has a highway range of about 200 miles between fills, based on the test-week run. In the city, the gas Vic inhales at the equivalent rate of 10 miles per gallon, compared with about 18 miles per gallon for the regular Vic.\n\nI usually filled the four pressurized canisters of the gas Vic every time the fuel gauge dipped below the half mark. But on one run, I figured I’d run that sucker on the highway until it got three-quarters low, and then turn around and head toward one of the 19 natural gas filling stations in the Washington metropolitan area.\n\nHah! The trip down I-66 west was totally righteous. Zoom-de-zoom and all of that. But I failed to pay attention to what was happening on I-66 east. That road was jammed — seven miles outside of the District of Columbia, 12 miles from the nearest natural gas pump in Southeast D.C.\n\nThe last wisp of natural gas vanished as I pulled into the station. The Vic’s “check engine” light glowed orange. The car was wheezing, but I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nBackground: The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require cities with smoggy air to start doing more to clean up the mess. That means producing cleaner-running cars and cleaner gasolines. It also means a genuine push for the development of alternative-fuel vehicles, such as the tested gas Vic, and electric cars and vans.\n\nBecause natural gas is readily available, because natural gas vehicles are cheaper to produce and run than electr ic models and because the gassers reduce smog-causing pollutants by as much as 98 percent, natural gas has at least the short-term edge in the race for new-fuel automobiles.\n\nComplaints: Some things remain to be worked out before natural-gas cars can have mass appeal. Improved driving range is a must. A new fuel gauge, specifically designed to measure natural gas pressure and onboard availability, is needed. More compact gas canisters would be helpful. Ah, standardized filling nozzles at natural gas stations is an absolute must. I had to lug around some five pounds of metal adapters to guarantee access to pumps.\n\nOf course, more natural gas filling stations are needed. As of July 1993, there were 730 natural gas filling stations nationwide, compared with some 140,000 gasoline outlets.\n\nPraise: Very clean burn. Superior acceleration. Super-smooth engine performance. Long-term test notes by Washington Gas indicate that the natural-gas Vic also has overall lowe maintenance costs than comparable gasoline-powered cars.\n\nThe tested Vic uses the same electronically fuel-injected, 4.6-liter V-8 found in the gasoline-powered car. That engine is rated 190 horsepower at 4,200 rpm, with a maximum torque of 260 horsepower at 3,200 rpm when running on gasoline. It kicks out about 200 horsepower with natural gas.\n\nTest car was equipped with dual air bags and anti-lock brakes.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Cop car.\n\nSafety: Researchers regard compressed natural gas cars as being safer than gasoline models in crashes. The aluminum, fiberglass-wrapped gas canisters have proved more rupture resistant than gasoline tanks in tests. Natural gas, which dissipates more quickly than gasoline fumes in the event of rupture, is less likely to explode.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Faster than greased lightning. The ride is what you’d expect in an otherwise normal Crown Vic: soft, billowy. Brakes, power four-wheel discs with anti-lock, were excellent.\n\nSound system: Didn’t listen.\n\nPrice: Experimental car. No real-world, consumer pricing applicable at this time.\n\nPump pricing: Using equivalent gallons, natural gas (which has a 130-octane rating) costs about 80 cents per gallon, versus about $1.36 a gallon for the highest-rated (95 octane) gasoline.\n\nProspect: This is a technology with a future.",

If the fountain of youth exists, the Crown Vic should be hooked up via IV to those magical, restoring waters.\n\nFord realizes the problem.\n\n“In the ’60s, big sedans were prestigious. People aspired to buy them just like they aspire to buy [sport-utility vehicles] today. But people don’t aspire to big sedans today because the industry builds boring ones,” J Mays, vice president of design for Ford, told us at the unveiling of the Ford 427 concept at a preview in Las Vegas before it hit the auto-show circuit to test consumer reaction.\n\nMays calls the 427 “the reinvention of the big Ford sedan,” noting that, “40 years ago there was nothing more popular than the sedan. Up to 1.4 million were sold each year. There were no SUVs back then. It’s not that people walked away from big sedans; it’s that the industry walked away. If we go back, customers will go back. Detroit needs to be Detroit, to stop trying to be Japanese or German. Nothing is more American than the big sedan–it isn’t Japanese or German.”\n\nFord has set out to solve the problem, as evidenced by the concept 427 sedan built off a longer, wider stretch of the Ford DEW platform, same one used for the Thunderbird, Lincoln LS and next-generation Mustang. Though rear-wheel-drive, it could be adapted to all-wheel-drive as well.\n\nThe sedan concept owes its name to its 427-cubic-inch, 7-liter, 590-horsepower V-10 derived from the 5.4-liter, V-8 in the Mustang Cobra R.\n\nIf built, perhaps for ’06, the 427 would be a companion to the midsize Ford Five Hundred sedan coming out for ’05.\n\nWith the 427, Ford would take one giant leap toward rebuilding that full-size sedan segment. With a V-10 sedan holding the promise of a little kick, Ford also would take aim at younger buyers as well.\n\nThe current full-size Crown Vic is dressed conservatively. The 427 is more fashionable. The 427 thick, bent-bar grille is bold, the Crown Vic grille is body-colored. The 427 stands out in the crowd, Crown Vic blends into it. Crown Vic advance technology is minimal–traction control and wiper-activated headlamps so the lights go on when the wipers do.\n\nYouth, which in the case of the Crown Vic means those younger than 65, aren’t served by this sedan.\n\nWhat’s new for the ’03 Crown Vic we tested?\n\nWheels and wheel covers.\n\nWhat new technol ogy?\n\nTraction control–a $175 option.\n\nYou no longer can get a candy bar for a nickel or a Tribune for a quarter, but you can still get a Crown Vic.\n\nOK, so what if Crown Vic attracts an older buyer? There are lots of older buyers with lots of money who have kept this nameplate going for decades. Seniors don’t necessarily covet the same cars younger ones do.\n\nEven so, Crown Vic could serve the older buyers better. For example, outside mirrors are a tad small. And radio control buttons are small and not easy to see or use by those who don’t have a cutesy, Gen-alpha designation for their age.\n\nAnd it sure would be nice if there were a push-button mode for the heater to direct warm air to the face and feet at the same time.\n\nAs a nice gesture, the Ford tosses in leather seats, but leather seats tend to be a little slippery instead of holding older occupants in place. And without a corresponding heater button, leather seats are cruel and unusual punishment in the Snow Belt for any age group.\n\nOn the positive side, the fuel-filler door and trunk-release buttons are large and in the driver’s door to make those tasks easier; the fuel gauge comes with an arrow pointing to the side the filler door is on so you always pull up to the correct side at the pump; and the trunk is large and the floor is flat to make carrying luggage or groceries less of a chore.\n\nThe test car also came with an optional $190 trunk organizer, a massive plastic chest that sits deep and flat in the trunk well with individual compartments to hold a wealth of items you don’t want rattling around in back.\n\nOpening the right side compartments is a bit tricky, however, because the full-size spare on the rear ledge sticks out above. But if there is a group that demands a full-size spare, it’s the seniors who feel cheated by mini spares.\n\nThe optional traction control is a must for those motoring in the Snow Belt.\n\nHad plenty of opportunity to rely on the system over snow-covered roadways. It sure helped getting the rear-wheel-drive sedan moving through the slop. But while the traction control helps get you going, a more sophisticated stability-control system designed to keep the rear end still in corners and turns would be appreciated more.\n\nThe LX Sport model we tested comes with a suspension tuned to minimize road harshness while keeping the weight under control for better handling than the base model. The 17-inch radial tires, a sporty upgrade from the standard 16-inch treads, also contribute to improved handling.\n\nThe LX is powered by a 4.6-liter, 224-horsepower V-8 with ample muscle to move with the traffic from the light or merge/pass when needed. Considering this is a full-size, five-passenger sedan powered by a V-8 with 4-speed automatic, the fuel economy rating is very good at 18 m.p.g. city/26 m.p.g. highway.\n\nOther new features for ’03 include speed-sensitive, variable-assist power steering to make it easier to maneuver and park the big sedan at low speeds; optional side-impact air bags; standard overhead console in the LX and LX Sport to hold such items as glasses; and a standard valet key.\n\nThe ’03 Crown Victoria LX Sport starts at $29,475. Standard equipment includes four-wheel anti-lock brakes; AM/FM stereo with cassette player; eight-way power driver’s seat; air conditioning; power windows, locks and outside mirrors; power adjustable brake/gas pedals that move to you at the push of a button so you don’t have to power the seat forward to reach the pedals; floor console with lots of storage capacity plus a power plug; and redundant climate/audio controls in the steering wheel, though the controls in the wheel don’t show you how to get warm air to face and feet at the same time, either.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Ford Crown Victoria LX Sport\n\nWheelbase: 11 4.7 inches\n\nLength: 212 inches\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter, 224-h.p. V-8\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 18 m.p.g. city/26 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $29,475\n\nPrice as tested: $29,660. Includes $190 for trunk organizer; $175 for traction control; $255 for driver/passenger side-impact air bags; and $165 for six-disc CD changer. Subtract $600 for leather-seat discount. Add $725 for freight.\n\nPluses: Gets you where you’re going with lots of size and weight wrapped around you. Traction control reduces many of the traditional problems with managing a big, rear-wheel-drive car in Snow Belt. Mileage good for a full-size sedan.\n\nMinuses: Traction control helps, but more sophisticated stability control is the better answer. Long overdue for styling, technology upgrade. Leather seats without warmers is cruel and unusual punishment. Can you read the controls?",
