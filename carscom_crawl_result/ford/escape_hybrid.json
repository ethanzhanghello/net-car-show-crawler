      "expert_review": "Ford Motor Co. was the first U.S. automaker to offer a true gasoline-electric hybrid powertrain on one of its vehicles, with the 2005 introduction of the compact Ford Escape hybrid sport utility.\n\nIt was also the first to offer an SUV offered with a hybrid system.\n\nThe company followed the next year with a hybrid version of the similar Mercury Mariner.\n\nEssentially, these are the same vehicle, but with one major difference: The Escape is offered in either the less-expensive front-drive version or the costlier all-wheel-drive model, while the Mariner is available only with all-wheel drive.\n\nEntering its third year in production, the Escape for 2007 gets four new options packages that combine appearance, infotainment and safety features.\n\nOne of those is a package that brings front seat-mounted side air bags and a side-curtain canopy air bag system to protect front and rear outboard passengers ($595). Production of these hybrids is limited to just a few thousand a year, and during the recent spike in gas prices, these vehicles – as well as most of the other affordable hybrids – were hard to find.\n\nOne reason for the limits on production is the limited availability of the battery packs that are used to power the vehicles’ electric motors.\n\nThe other reason is that Ford doesn’t make much money on the sale of a hybrid, and would like to keep their numbers to a minimum. For now, hybrids such as these are meant more as a public-relations statement than a serious attempt at saving fuel and helping the environment.\n\nThe Escape is one of the few hybrids that can recoup the extra costs of the hybrid system at the gas pumps in a relatively short period, according to a recent study by the consumer automotive Web service Edmunds.com.\n\nAccording to Edmunds, the 2007 Escape hybrid would recover the $1,218 extra cost of the hybrid system in 2.9 years at 15,000 miles a year, and 1.7 years at 25,000 miles annually.\n\nThe premium for the hybrid drivetrain was calculated from the cost of an ’07 Escape XLT, which Edmunds determined was the gasoline model with equipment and options most closely matching the standard features of the hybrid.\n\nTo allay a concern many consumers have about the hybrids – the expense of replacing the nickel-metal-hydride battery pack should it fail – the Escape and Mariner come with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty on all hybrid-system components, including the battery pack.\n\nBeyond that, though, replacement of the batteries, which are installed under the rear cargo floor, could costs as much as $5,000.\n\nFor this report, we tested the front-drive Escape model (base price $25,600 plus $615 freight), but we previously had tested the all-wheel-drive Mariner model, which begins just under $30,000.\n\nWe found both vehicles to be capable of handling a family’s vacation travel needs the way a good SUV should, while giving nearly 30 miles to the gallon in combined city/highway use (slightly higher for the front-drive model).\n\nThat’s more than a 50 percent improvement over the mileage of most midsize, gasoline-powered sport utilities. Over long highway drives, the hybrids’ fuel economy is quite evident.\n\nWhile they have some different external styling touches, the Escape and Mariner are very much alike. They share the hybrid drivetrain.\n\nThe Escape and Mariner come with a 2.3-liter, four-cylinder Atkinson cycle gasoline engine and a 70-kw electric motor, connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nThis is a true hybrid system, unlike those used on the Honda Civic, Accord and Insight hybrids and the new Saturn Vue Green Line.\n\nOn those vehicles, the electric motor is used only to assist the gasoline engine, but cannot propel the vehicle alone.\n\nBut with the Escape and Mariner, along with all of Toyota’s hybrids and the new Nissan Altima hybrid, the electric motor can move the vehicle by itself at speeds up to about 25 mph.\n\nThe Escape/Mariner gasoline engine is rated at 133 horsepower, and the electric motor is equivalent to 94 horsepower.\n\nTogether they give these vehicles a combined 155 horsepower, and 50 percent better fuel economy in city driving than a V-6 powered Escape or Mariner. Yet acceleration is comparable to that of a V-6, Ford says.\n\nThat might be a bit of a stretch, though, depending on what six-cylinder engine they’re talking about. The power is almost as much as that of the V-6 in the comparably sized Chevrolet Equinox (185 horsepower), but much less than the Honda V-6 that powers the gasoline-only version of the Saturn Vue (248 HP).\n\nThe Escape we tested did have adequate power for most situations, even though it felt more like a four-cylinder car than a V-6 most of the time. Most consumers should be able to live with that, though, in return for the greatly improved fuel economy.\n\nWith two-wheel drive, the Escape’s EPA ratings are 36 miles per gallon in the city and 31 mpg on the highway.\n\nFor the four-wheel-drive models, the figures are 33 city/29 highway.\n\nThe mileage for city driving is higher than for highway cruising because the vehicle is designed to shut off its gasoline engine during stops and to start up only on electric power.\n\nThe battery pack – which is separate from the 12-volt battery that is used to start the gasoline engine — is recharged automatically whenever the gasoline engine is running, when the car is braking, or when the car is coasting. As with other gasoline-electric hybrids, the car never has to be “plugged in” to an external power source.\n\nFord developed its own hybrid system and did not copy any of Toyota’s processes, but the final Ford system was so similar in many ways to Toyota’s that Ford licensed 20 hybrid-drive patents from Toyota to avoid potential patent-infringement claims.\n\nToyota and Ford both acknowledge that the Escape and Mariner do not use any Toyota hybrid-drive components, however. Ford’s are made by the Japanese automotive supplier Aisin.\n\nAs with the regular Escape and Mariner, the hybrid models seat five people quite comfortably, and there is plenty of room for luggage in the rear cargo area.\n\nThe cargo compartment has a lift gate that opens all in one piece, or the rear window can be opened by itself to load small items without opening the entire door. This is handy when the entire cargo area is packed, and opening the door might allow some things to fall out.\n\nThe vehicle rides smoothly on the highway, but is a bit noisy. Part of that noise is from the four-cylinder engine working so hard in conjunction with the continuously variable transmission, which has no identifiable shift points.\n\nStandard on the front-drive Escape hybrid are such amenities as power four-wheel antilock disc brakes; power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote control; electric power steering; 16-inch aluminum wheels; AM/FM stereo with six-disc, in-dash CD changer and six speakers; front fog lights; air conditioning with privacy glass; six-way power driver’s seat; cruise control; roof rack; tilt steering wheel; floor shifter with center console; tire-pressure monitoring system; premium cloth front bucket and rear bench seats; driver-information center; roof side rails; four-wheel independent suspension; and an anti-theft system.\n\nExtras on our tester included the navigation/audiophile stereo system upgrade ($1,995); the safety package ($595), which added the front seat side air bags and the side-canopy air bag system; an exterior appearance package ($695); and a 110-volt power outlet ($180), located in the center console between the front seats.\n\nTotal sticker for our vehicle was $29,705, including freight and options. A federal tax credit may be available on the purchase of an Escape hybrid; check with your tax preparer.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "The idea behind a hybrid vehicle is to get decent fuel mileage and lower emissions without sacrificing performance or capability.\n\nSure, you could get great gas mileage from a minimalistic microcar, but who’d want to? European drivers, forced to conserve by economics, rely on subcompacts often powered by small diesel engines. American drivers may want to conserve more and pollute less, but without compromising the amenities.\n\nSo you hook up a high-torque electric motor to work in consort with a smallish gasoline engine, using an extraordinarily complex computer system to sort it all out.\n\nThe Ford Escape Hybrid was one of the earlier efforts, coming just on the heels of Toyota and Honda hybrids. When it arrived in 2004, it was the first hybrid SUV, later joined by the nearly identical Mercury Mariner Hybrid. There have been rumors of a possible Ford Fusion sedan hybrid on its way.\n\nStill relying on a gasoline/electric hybrid system similar to that used by Toyota, Escape arrives for 2008 with performance and efficiency improvements that make it run more smoothly and quietly. The hybrid gets the same bold body restyling as the regular Escape that makes it look like a downsized Explorer.\n\nFuel mileage is right up there, as advertised. In normal urban and suburban driving, I actually did better than the EPA figure, getting 37-38 miles per gallon, according to the on-board computer. In one trip from north-central Phoenix to Scottsdale and back, with the air-conditioning turned off, I averaged better than 40 mpg.\n\nMileage dropped off in highway driving, the wind resistance from Escape’s boxy styling no doubt taking a toll. Overall, my mileage averaged about 34 mpg, a good result for a well-equipped SUV that drives nicely and doesn’t cost a fortune.\n\nFord Escape Hybrid\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door hybrid SUV, front-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 2.3-liter in-line four, 133 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 124 pound-feet torque at 4,250 rpm; electric-drive motor, 70 kilowatts.\n\nTransmission: Continuously variable.\n\nWheelbase: 103.1 inches.\n\nOverall length: 174.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,638 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 34 city, 30 highway.\n\nHighs: Improved fuel economy, new styling, moderate base price.\n\nLows: Modest performance, no grab handles, boxy aerodynamics.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $25,075\n\nPrice as tested: $31,165\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Navigation system, with six-CD audio, $2,695.\n\n* Premium package, with leather package, power heated mirrors, 110-volt electrical outlet, roof rack, $1,195.\n\n* Moonroof and satellite radio, $995.\n\n* Side step bars, $345.\n\n* Chrome package, $195.\n\n* Shipping, $665.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nPerformance: The constant interchange between gas engine and electric motor is nearly imperceptible, other than a few unusual sounds.\n\nThe ability of the engine to shut off while stopped or coasting below 20 mph while the electric motor takes over helps Escape gain mileage in urban driving. This is a benefit shared with Toyota hybrids.\n\nBut the air-conditioner operates conventionally via an engine-driven belt, so when the AC is on, the engine has to run constantly even when the Escape is stopped, eliminating the mileage advantage. Toyota gets around this problem with an AC that works electrically.\n\nDrivability: Escape Hybrid gains about 250 pounds over the regular Escape, and it feels heavier. But it handles and accelerates reasonably well, and the electric power steering feels better than most.\n\nStyling: The new look gives Escape a more masculine appearance, with the bright chrome grille looking distinctive.\n\nBut Escape’s boxy styling loses its luster on the highway. Gas mileage fades as you push this brick through the air.\n\nInterior: Escape’s interior looks and feels rich, with designs and textures that seem sturdy as well as attractive. The combination video screen for navigation, audio and hybrid-system monitoring works well without a lot of fuss for changing radio stations or switching functions.\n\nOne missing piece: There are no grab handles in the ceiling for passengers.\n\nBottom line: A likable and competent hybrid SUV offered at a moderate price.",

      "expert_review": "Our family’s new year’s resolution for 2005 is to become more Earth conscious. For us, that means starting to recycle. I think that driving the Escape Hybrid for two weeks officially pardons me from those occasional yogurt cups I’ve “mistakenly” thrown in the garbage since January 1.\n\nI’ve been so anxious to drive this car since a reader of mine wrote in asking if it would fit three child seats. She says that a salesman at a Ford dealer swears to her up and down that since it has three seatbelts in the back seat, three child car seats will fit. Well, we all know from experience that he must be on something. Either that, or he’s a young guy without kids who’s never seen how honking big child seats are these days.\n\nI tried fitting three child seats in the back of the Escape Hybrid, to no avail. I have a Britax Roundabout (forward facing 5-point harness), a Graco something-or-other (forward facing 5-point harness) and a Graco Turbo Booster. There just isn’t enough width in the back seat to fit all three (two of which have protruding snack and cup holders). Seats of differing sizes might fit (check out www.carseatdata.org for measurements on popular child seat models). The Latch connectors in the two outer seating positions are easy to see and easy to use.\n\nFor children who like to climb in on their own, I highly recommend a running board. My 4-year-old greased up several pair of tights attempting to get into the Escape on her own. She insists on wearing ballet tights to school nearly every day.\n\nThe cargo space in the Escape Hybrid is large and functional. I didn’t put my double stroller in it, however. After a recent disaster at the mall, I’ve decided my kids are too big for the double stroller now. It was too heavy to turn so I had to go in straight lines only.\n\nThe cargo space sports an extra dry cleaning hook that actually holds hangers (unlike others I’ve experienced). To expand the storage room, the rear seat has a 60/40 split, and requires a two-step process to fold.\n\nThe driver’s seat is easy to adjust and offers a clear and unobstructed view of the road. I find myself trying to pull the steering wheel toward me, however. It would be more comfortable with a telescoping steering wheel.\n\nAlthough I haven’t actually used it, the addition of the 110V power outlet (for $110) is cool. Ford claims its “perfect for … air pump, electric razor or even holiday lights at the campsite.” I’m thinking more along the lines of a bottle heater, butt-wipe warmer or handheld steam cleaner. Either way, it could really come in handy.\n\nDriving the Escape Hybrid is an interesting experience. The gas engine turns on and off to maximize fuel consumption. I don’t notice it while driving, but while idling in the carpool lane I’m startled on a couple of occasions when the engine starts up on its own accord. As with the Ford Freestyle that I drove recently, I find it difficult to get up to speed when entering the highway. Both highway noise and engine noise are slightly annoying (the engine in a full hybrid can run at a higher speed than in other vehicles in order to maximize fuel consumption). During night driving I’m unable to use the cruise controls that are black and hard to see.\n\nThe real benefit to the Escape Hybrid is the hybrid part. Not only does it make trips to the gas station less frequent, it also produces “as little as half of the amount of C02” as other vehicles. This helps me do my part to save the world, and rids my conscience of guilt for the 28 years that I didn’t recycle.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Ford Escape Hybrid is one of a few Ford vehicles to offer the option of a self-parking system. The vehicle comes in a base and Limited trim, which incorporates added entertainment and comfort options. Competitors include the Toyota Highlander Hybrid.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe Escape Hybrid has a plunging chrome grille that would be equally at home on a Volkswagen Jetta or Passat. A raised hood and high belt line may make the SUV look tougher, but they probably don’t do much for visibility. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 16-inch aluminum wheels\nAvailable moonroof\nCapless refueling nozzle instead of fuel cap\n\nInterior\nThe Escape Hybrid seats five people in two rows of seats. It has a swing-up hatch, and the rear seats fold in a 60/40 split to increase cargo capacity. A leather-wrapped steering wheel is standard. Interior features include:\n\nStandard front dual-zone air conditioning\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nOptional leather seats\nOptional rearview camera\nOptional navigation system with traffic information\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe self-parking system handles all the steering required for parallel parking. The driver must still shift the transmission into gear as well as operate the gas and brake pedals. The driver can override the system and steer the car, if needed. The Escape Hybrid’s 153-horsepower gasoline engine uses the Atkinson-cycle combustion process for greater fuel efficiency.\n\nStandard 153-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 136 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard 94-hp, 330-volt permanent magnet motor\nStandard continuously variable automatic transmission\nFront- or all-wheel drive\nCapable of moving on electric power alone at low speeds\n\nSafety\nThe Escape Hybrid incorporates Roll Stability Control. It is the only system with a sensor that detects the beginning of a rollover and can act to stop it. Other safety equipment includes:\n\nStandard side-impact airbags for the front seats\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nStandard integrated blind spot mirrors",

      "expert_review": "Why would President-elect Barack Obama trade in his sporty and luxurious, Hemi-powered Chrysler 300C on a 4-cylinder and battery Ford Escape hybrid compact SUV?\n\nWhy would a liberal go conservative?\n\nTo learn the practical, if not political, motivation, we slipped behind the wheel of a 2009 Escape Limited hybrid with on-demand all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe numbers on the window sticker tell the story: 29 m.p.g. city / 27 highway from an AWD sport-utility vehicle that can travel off-road or stay on-road when the snow’s there too.\n\nThe magic 30 m.p.g. city rating would be more attractive. With two-wheel-drive, Escape hybrid leaps to 34 m.p.g. city / 31 highway, ideal for those in Florida and southern California.\n\nThe Escape hybrid teams a 2.5-liter, 153-horsepower 4-cylinder-an upgrade from last year’s 2.3-liter, 133-h.p. 4-with nickel-metal hydride battery pack and a continuously variable automatic transmission. This gives the 2.5 a bit more off-the-line vitality, though not quite enough, and it still has too much noise.\n\nBatteries get the vehicle started and keep it moving up to 40 m.p.h., Ford says, before the gas engine kicks in. There are exceptions, of course. The gas engine gets things going on cold mornings when batteries tend to hit the snooze button. And to hit 40 m.p.h. in battery mode you have to tap the gas pedal with a toe-preferably the little one-not your foot.\n\nBest we got with batteries was 28 m.p.h. before the gas engine kicked on, and we didn’t need the power to pass or merge; we had simply gone far enough that the battery pack needed more juice. Escape doesn’t plug in; it recharges on the fly.\n\nAs with all gas/electrics, Escape sports hybrid badges on its body panels to let others in on your preference for green, but in the cabin conservation is on a need-to-know basis. And the driver apparently doesn’t.\n\nPush the “i” button on the tiny navi screen in the dash, and schematics show when the gas engine, battery pack or both are working or at rest rather than wasting fuel at the light. You also get an instant mileage reading and an average of the last 15 minutes.\n\nThe system revealed that on a 60-mile jaunt with a good mix of stop-and-go city and speed-limit-and-beyond highway driving we averaged 34 m.p.g., far better than the government rating, though without the fuel-consuming AWD system engaged. No snow, so no practical way to determine m.p.g. with AWD.\n\nIt’s nice to know when in battery or gas, but the tendency is to focus on the screen rather than the road to see that passing, merging and climbing sends the gauge below 20 m.p.g., while tiptoeing, coasting and flat surfaces push the needle to the 60 m.p.g. ceiling.\n\nWe’d prefer a large gauge atop the dash that lets everyone know when in battery and when not and mileage at the moment.\n\nOn top of the hybrid system, Ford made a major safety upgrade to Escape. Traction control had been offered to minimize slipping when starting from a light on snow or ice. The hybrid adds stability control as standard to help the driver maintain maximum control in turns and corners by minimizing oversteer or understeer. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes and side-curtain air bags complement the package.\n\nBesides hitting 30 m.p.g. in the city and enlarging the hybrid-saves-gas display, we hope the next generation has a slightly wider and longer cabin so occupants don’t feel like they’re driving around in their the cubicle from work.\n\nAnd with the Flex and Edge crossovers boasting such dramatic styling, Escape deserves something other than plain vanilla.\n\nOn-demand AWD means all-season motoring, though there’s no “low” for heavy-duty off-roading.\n\nNice touches include a 110-volt, 150-watt console power outlet for a computer; time/date/temp/direction readings in the dash top; capless fuel-filler nozzle; cell-phone/iPod holders in the center console; cargo hold access through the rear window or lift-open tailgate; and rear seats that fold flat, providing you remove headrests.\n\nEscape Limited AWD hybrid starts at $32,385 (XLT 2WD $28,305, XLT AWD $30,055) and qualifies for a $1,950 alt-fuel vehicle tax credit. It comes loaded with the power goodies, including moonroof, plus Sync, the system that turns it into a voice-activated rolling sound system. Navi is a $2,395 option.\n\nFord adds its first hybrid sedans-Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan-early next year after they bow this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "I’ve been a fan of the Ford Escape Hybrid for several years; it’s a tough-looking SUV that embraces its truck roots.\n\nIf you’re looking for a smooth ride, you’ll want to look elsewhere because the Escape Hybrid rides more like a truck than a car; you’ll definitely feel all the bumps in this baby and know what kind of terrain the four huge tires are climbing. Personally, I liked this no-secrets approach because I used the sensory feedback to let me know how to adjust my driving to road conditions. Some moms (and finicky passengers) might prefer a softer, more carlike feel.\n\nThe Escape Hybrid has a 155-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine that’s paired with a 94-hp electric motor. It was fun to drive, and I never felt like there was a lack of power. While it moved quietly when in electric mode, I occasionally noticed some engine noise creeping in when the four-cylinder was engaged, which served to remind me that this is no cushy crossover.\n\nThe Escape Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 30/27 mpg city/highway. In the city, I averaged roughly 25 mpg, which isn’t quite as high as the estimates but not bad for all the stop ‘n’ go traffic.\n\nMy biggest problem with Escape Hybrid is its price: My top-of-the-line model cost roughly $37,000. That’s getting really close to luxury-car territory. For about $45,000 you can get a 2010 BMW X5. The Escape Hybrid is a small SUV from Ford, not Lincoln, so it needs to be priced accordingly.\n\nExterior\n\nDespite the exterior design trend to make everything rounded, I still love the Escape Hybrid’s square edges. This mommy likes a big, bad chrome grille, and the Escape Hybrid delivered tons of shine; perhaps enough for a quick tooth check before heading in to meet friends?\n\nFrom the side, the Escape Hybrid is all buttoned up, with straight, sturdy-looking lines accenting big, square windows, which offer great visibility. The rear window can open independently of the liftgate; I loved this feature because it could help when you’re hauling those excessively long items from the local home center.\n\nHowever, I had some problems when it came to hauling my kids. My test SUV didn’t have running boards ($345). Without them, my 4-year-old had a hard time climbing into the Escape Hybrid. It usually took several attempts before he could get into the backseat. If you have younger kids, I’d get the running boards.\n\nOne thing was certain in the Escape Hybrid, my kids needed of a quick scrubbing before going into public after a ride in it. The dark gray plastic beneath the doors was a dirt-collecting magnet that my kids would brush against while climbing into the SUV, leaving them with dirty coats and pants. Eww!\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nWhile the Escape Hybrid stays rugged on the outside, it manages a softer look on the inside with Stone-colored leather, shimmering accents and a sunroof to let in a little natural light. Color matters, and the Escape Hybrid’s interior reminded me of a sunny morning in the clean version of my kitchen.\n\nThere’s tons of cool technology in the Escape Hybrid. From watching the engine’s performance and checking our family calendar (perfect for moms on the go) on the center stack’s touch-screen to using the Sync system to call Daddy from the road, this hybrid kept us on the ball.\n\nThe Escape Hybrid’s seating was firm yet comfortable up front. My test car had heated seats for the front row. In the backseat, my boys were able to buckle up by themselves. What a relief. However, the backseat cupholders, which sit at the rear of the center console, were out of reach for the kids.\n\nMy boys loved selecting the color of the hybrid’s ambient lighting. This seriously kept my youngest busy for at least 15 minutes while we waited in the school parking lot for his big bro to join us.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Escape Hybrid’s Latch connectors scored major points with me because they weren’t hidden beneath the seatback. My son’s booster seat fit well in the backseat, which is flat with no bolsters to get in the way, and there’s enough legroom in the second row to accommodate a rear-facing child-safety seat.\n\nThe Escape Hybrid has standard Roll Stability Control, a sensor detects the beginning of a rollover and can act to stop it. This system is only available on SUVs from Ford-owned brands. The hybrid also has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, electronic stability control and traction control. It has standard front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nMy top-of-the-line test car had a standard backup camera, but it’s optional on the base model. The Escape Hybrid now offers MyKey, a programmable key that allows parents to encourage teen drivers to drive more safely and efficiently by limiting the car’s top speed to 80 mph; it also ensures that they’re using their seat belts. There’s also a newly available auto-park option that helps people like me with the dreaded parallel parking.\n\nThe Escape Hybrid scored the highest rating of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In past years these crash-test scores would earn it a Top Safety Pick, however, this year IIHS has added a rollover crash test to its Top Safety Pick requirements. The Escape Hybrid scored the lowest score of Poor in this crash test.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Child-safety seats should fit without any problems.\n\nIn School: Younger kids might need help getting into this SUV, but once in, it’s a good fit for kids.\n\nTeens: The programmable MyKey gives parents some control over their teen drivers.",
