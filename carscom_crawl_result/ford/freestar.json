      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord introduced the Freestar in 2004, which replaced the company’s Windstar minivan. Mercury’s Monterey is closely related, and both are manufactured in Canada.\n\nThe 2006 lineup includes three models: SE, SEL and Limited. The Limited now uses chrome on the 16-inch wheels, door handles and roof rack, but 17-inch polished alloy wheels are optional.\n\nAn SE Appearance Package is available for 2006, and the SEL gets bright, machined, 16-inch wheels. The front door panels have been redesigned. New standard equipment includes cruise control, a CD player, roof rails and a tire-pressure-monitoring system.\n\nFord has indicated that it may stop making minivans after the 2006 model year.\n\nExterior\nThe Freestar’s appearance is similar to the Windstar’s. Distinctive front-end styling themes differentiate Freestar trims. The SE model has a body-colored grille, whereas a chrome grille and five-spoke aluminum wheels go on the SEL. Limited models have exclusive exterior trim and power sliding doors, as well as heated signal mirrors with puddle lamps.\n\nLarge upright headlights and an eggcrate grille integrate with the hood and front fenders. Contoured rear bumpers promise a low liftover height.\n\nStandard wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels are optional. Measuring 201 inches long overall, the Freestar rides a 120.8-inch wheelbase. Self-sealing tires and a power liftgate are optional.\n\nInterior\nFreestars can seat up to seven occupants. Second-row bucket seats in upper-end models include a fold-and-tumble feature. The third-row seat can be positioned to face the rear for tailgate parties, and it can fold flat into the floor. Cargo space behind the third row totals 27.4 cubic feet. A covered compartment atop the dashboard holds small items.\n\nOverhead consoles on the SEL and Limited contain readouts for outside temperature, a compass and auxiliary buttons for the power sliding doors, if installed. Front-door cupholders can hold 20-ounce beverages. Ford’s Conversation Mirror lets drivers watch children in the rear. Power-adjustable pedals, a DVD entertainment system and Ford’s Reverse Sensing System are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 193-horsepower, 3.9-liter V-6 is standard in the SE model. A 4.2-liter V-6 in the SEL and Limited generates 201 hp and 263 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. On Freestars equipped with Ford’s AdvanceTrac electronic stability system, panic brake assist — which applies added pressure in an emergency — is included. A Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbag system is available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLike its Windstar predecessor, the Freestar seems a little more trucklike than most minivans. When parking, this minivan seems unusually wide.\n\nPerformance with the 4.2-liter V-6 is energetic, and the automatic transmission yields prompt, smooth shifts. Moderate engine noise during acceleration is present. The Freestar is fairly easy to drive and maneuvers with acceptable agility. The ride is sufficiently smooth on good surfaces.\n\nThe seat bottoms are short but offer good support. Front headroom is abundant, and elbowroom is adequate. Second-row occupants get plenty of space when bucket seats are installed. Squeezing into the third row isn’t too difficult.",

A cargo van version is also available.\n\nExterior\nDistinctive front-end styling themes differentiate Freestar trims. The SE model has a body-colored grille, whereas a chrome grille and 16-inch five-spoke aluminum wheels go on the SEL. Limited models have chrome exterior trim and power sliding doors, as well as heated signal mirrors with puddle lamps and 16-inch chrome wheels.\n\nLarge upright headlights and an eggcrate grille integrate with the hood and front fenders.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord introduced a brand-new minivan for 2004 named the Freestar, which replaced Ford’s Windstar minivan. Mercury’s Monterey is related to the Freestar.\n\nFive trim levels are available: S, SE, SES, SEL and top-of-the-line Limited. The third-row seat can be positioned to face the rear for tailgate parties, and it can fold flat into the floor. A power liftgate became optional after the start of the 2004 model year.\n\nFor 2005, a new liftgate spoiler is available on the SES model. Ford indicated that it could stop making minivans after 2005.\n\nExterior\nThe Freestar’s appearance is similar to the previous Windstar. Distinctive front-end styling themes differentiate the models. S and SE models have a body-color treatment. The SEL and Limited get a chrome grille, and the SES displays a black grille. Limited models have color-coordinated two-tone lower body paint.\n\nLarge upright headlights and an eggcrate grille integrate with the hood and front fenders. Contoured rear bumpers promise a low liftover height.\n\nStandard tires measure 16 inches in diameter, but 17-inch tires on aluminum wheels are optional. Measuring 201 inches long overall, the Freestar rides a 120.8-inch wheelbase.\n\nInterior\nThe Freestar will seat up to seven occupants. In S, SE and SES models, the standard second-row bench seat can slide horizontally. Second-row captain’s chairs in upper-end models include a fold-and-tumble feature.\n\nOverhead consoles contain readouts for outside temperature, a compass and auxiliary buttons for the power sliding doors, if installed. Front-door cupholders can hold 20-ounce beverages. Ford’s Conversation Mirror lets drivers watch children in the rear. Adjustable pedals, a DVD entertainment system and Ford’s Reverse Sensing System are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 193-horsepower, 3.9-liter V-6 is standard in S, SE and SES models. A 4.2-liter V-6 in the SEL and Limited generates 201 hp and 263 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. On Freestars equipped with Ford’s AdvanceTrac electronic stability system, panic brake assist � which applies added pressure in an emergency � is included. Side-impact and side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nLike its Windstar predecessor, the Freestar seems a little more trucklike than most minivans. When parking, this minivan seems unusually wide.\n\nPerformance with the 4.2-liter V-6 is energetic, and the automatic transmission yields prompt, smooth shifts. Moderate engine noise during acceleration is present. The Freestar is fairly easy to drive, and it maneuvers with acceptable agility. The ride is sufficiently smooth on good surfaces.\n\nThe seat bottoms are short but offer good support. Front headroom is abundant, and elbowroom is adequate. Second-row occupants get plenty of space when bucket seats are installed. Squeezing into the third row isn’t too difficult.",

      "expert_review": "Freestar feels familiar\n\nThat’s right. It’s Freestar, not Windstar. When Ford Motor Co. launched its restyled Ford Windstar minivan last fall, the company gave it a new name to better fit its alliterative list of products, which includes the Focus and F-150 pickup. The name change is about the most radical part of the 2004 Ford Freestar.\n\nFord did not rip up the blueprints when it came to the exterior of its minivan . and that formed the basis for much of our discussion. We tested a well-equipped SEL model priced at $31,520.\n\nSHE: I know that you’re being a big crab about Ford’s redesigned minivan. You were hoping that they would have injected a bit of, God forbid, sexiness into the family hauler. Instead, Ford spent its money wisely, creating a third-row seat that easily folds flat and stows into the floor. And the seat can be flipped to face the rear for use when the vehicle is parked, great for soccer games. Ford gave the Freestar bigger brakes and a new 4.2-liter V-6 that comes standard on the SEL model we drove and the top-of-the-line Limited. It gave the Freestar its first DVD entertainment system, which families tell me is a necessity for kids on long trips. All thoughtful features. So why are you giving it a middle-of-the-road grade?\n\nHE: I think you’re judging me too harshly. In fact, I don’t think minivans need to be sexy. But there are a number of competitors that offer more features and meet the needs of their audience more completely than the Freestar. Let’s take that new 4.2-liter V-6 you mentioned. It makes 201 horsepower and is mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The Environmental Protection Agency rates that combination at 16 miles per gallon in city driving and 22 mpg on the highway. The horsepower figure, the transmission and the EPA fuel economy are strictly middle-of-the-road compared with the Honda Odyssey, which, by the way, is at the end of its current life cycle.\n\nSHE: Does it matter to you that the Freestar has what I consider the best coat hook in the business? It’s a great little gadget that’s recessed into the ceiling about 6 inches away from the door so that you can see it when you’re loading stuff from the dry cleaners. You don’t have to fumble around for it with your fingers. And that’s my point, it’s the little details in the Freestar that really won me over. Sometimes the biggest engine on the block isn’t the most important thing.\n\nHE: So let’s talk about details. I give Ford credit for installing some very simple and easy-to-use controls on the Freestar. The dual-zone temperature controls are a good example. You sure don’t need an engineering degree to figure them out. I thought the wood trim that Ford installed on the instrument panel was quite tasteful. But not every detail stood up to close scrutiny. We noticed gaps, for instance, where the hard plastic on the side pillars meets the headliner. It would have been nice, too, to have a small cargo net between the front seats, like some of the competition offers.\n\nSHE: But the big picture is that the Freestar is a very solid minivan, especially if you are determined to buy a domestic product. Our SEL had an optional side-curtain air bag system that protects all three rows of passengers, as well as optional power adjustable pedals. I really love the fact that you can jump in the Freestar, without getting any instruction from a sales person or an owner’s manual, and feel absolutely at home with the controls. That is not the feeling you get in the redesigned Nissan Quest minivan, which has an instrument panel that looks like it was designed by an aeronautical engineer. The Freestar has a very spare elegance in the cabin, which I’m sure a lot of moms will appreciate. They may not appreciate the fact that the second-row windows can’t roll down or that you can’t order it with a navigation system, however.\n\nHE: I think my biggest disappointment is tha Ford took the cheap and easy route, and decided only to do a modest face-lift on its minivan while competitors such as Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Co.p. are doing major ground-up redesigns. The new Toyota Sienna, for example, really raised the bar for other players in this segment, and I expect the redesigned 2005 Odyssey will do the same. Maybe Ford is content with fielding a middle-of-the-road product. But that’s no way to stand out in a crowd.",
