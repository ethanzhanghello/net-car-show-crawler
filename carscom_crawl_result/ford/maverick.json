      "expert_review": "Nearly half a century ago, Ford introduced a game-changing vehicle that became an inflection point for the auto industry and American culture — an affordable, stylish, widely appealing sporty car. The 1965 Ford Mustang was a marvel aimed at the youth market that found buyers across the spectrum thanks to its amazing combination of attributes. But times change, and now, 56 years later, we have this: the 2022 Ford Maverick. No, it’s not the same formula that made the Mustang an instant hit — but the Maverick is just as much a product of its time as the Mustang was of its era.\n\nSports coupes are out, and personal utility vehicles are in. In the “swinging ’60s,” it was glitz, power and speed. In these “terrible ’20s,” it’s all about efficiency, utility, ruggedness and go-anywhere, do-anything looks. That’s what Ford has delivered: an affordable, useful, stylish, economical, versatile vehicle that, like the original Mustang, combines popular style with attainable price. While that looks amazing on paper, what is the Maverick like to drive? Is it any good? It looks like a pickup truck, but does it work like a pickup truck?\n\nI came to Music City USA, Nashville, Tenn., to drive all the versions of the new Maverick — and I can say yes, it works. It works so very, very well.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Ford Maverick: Just Being a Compact Pickup Is Enough\n\nWee, Not-So-Wee and Friggin’ Huge\n\nWith a nod to that old Mike Myers bit on “Saturday Night Live,” those are essentially the three sizes that Ford pickups now come in. On the Friggin’ Huge side, we have the F-Series (any of them, really); not-so-wee, that’s the Ranger; and properly wee, that’s the Maverick. It’s small. You might think it looks like a big butch truck in videos and pictures, but stand next to it and you quickly realize that this thing is astonishingly tiny. Built off of Ford’s C2 platform, the same one that underpins the Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs, it sits low (you do not climb up into it at all), and has a low roof. Just how squat is it? There’s no bumper step to help you climb into the bed — if you want to hop into the bed, just open the tailgate, put a foot up on it and step into it.\n\nThose compact dimensions mean that a lot of thought and attention have gone into every aspect of how the Maverick works. You don’t have the massive real estate to play with that an F-Series does, so everything has to be smartly conceived and properly executed. It shows up in the details inside, where despite the tight dimensions, there’s room for no fewer than 16 huge bottles in the doors and front and rear consoles. The dashboard is horizontally oriented to give the impression of width despite not being all that wide. The center console doesn’t come up above the bottom seat cushions, allowing you more room to splay your knees, again creating the feeling of width. The backseat lower cushions flip up, allowing you to slide a bicycle in the back if you prefer to store it out of the elements instead of in the bed of the truck.\n\nThat smart packaging also translates into the integrated pickup bed out back. The Flexbed tailgate has adjustable cable stays that let you open it partway, creating a level plane with the tops of the wheel housings and allowing you to carry a full four-by-eight-foot sheet of plywood (or more than a few, up to a tailgate-load-limit of 500 pounds). The bed has cutouts that you can drop pieces of lumber into to make your own super-cheap bed dividers, and there’s even a QR code to scan that will take you to a YouTube channel full of DIY projects that Ford has created. There are 12-volt fused connectors behind cubby panels that you can use to tie in electronic accessories without having to run wiring up from the front or through the firewall.\n\n2022 Ford Maverick | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThere’s even another QR code inside that will help you download the computer-aided design file for the interior’s special connector slots, so you can create your own home 3-D-printed accessories. A lot of creative engineering and packaging design has gone into the Maverick, and it all comes together nicely to create something that feels quite purpose-built. The Maverick is a pickup truck, not a sport-activity-criss-cross-whatever, and it’s built as such.\n\nQuick or Efficient\n\nYou have a choice of two powertrains with the new Maverick, both perfectly acceptable but each distinctively different. Setting the Maverick apart from … well … everyone is the fact that it comes with a standard gas-electric hybrid powertrain. It’s a 2.5-liter four-cylinder mated to an electronic continuously variable automatic transmission that drives the front wheels only. It makes an easygoing 191 system horsepower and 155 pounds-feet of torque. That ain’t a whole lot, and it shows up in the Maverick’s lazier accelerator responses. It’s tuned for efficiency, and boy does it deliver — our admittedly brief run of a little more than 50 miles of mixed urban stop-and-go and slightly quicker twisty back roads turned in a 43 mpg combined reading from the trip computer. That’s pretty exceptional for a five-seat compact pickup that has a 1,500-pound payload rating and a base 2,000-pound towing capacity.\n\n2022 Ford Maverick | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nAround-town driving is just fine with the hybrid, and while you won’t be winning any stoplight drag races versus a Hyundai Santa Cruz, you’re likely not engaging in any to begin with. The hybrid’s operation is smooth and quiet, without any odd noises or weird transitions between electric and gasoline mode. And it does enjoy staying in electric mode for as long as it possibly can, further impressing upon you how remarkably solid and silent the Maverick is overall.\n\nBut if you’d rather trade a little efficiency for a lot more capability, the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine is what you want. Available with front- or all-wheel drive, it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and delivers a more robust 250 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque. It provides much snappier acceleration, and actually becomes obnoxiously fun when you engage the Maverick’s Sport mode thanks to quicker shifts and more aggressive throttle mapping. Your payload rating won’t change, but add the 4K Tow Package and your tow rating jumps to 4,000 pounds, enough to pull a small camper. The trade-off for this is fuel economy that drops considerably: The EcoBoost trucks are EPA rated at 23/30/26 mpg city/highway/combined for the FWD model and 22/29/25 mpg with AWD. Mixed driving returned about 26 mpg according to the Maverick’s onboard computer, which ain’t too shabby, either. The official numbers for the hybrid aren’t out at the time of this writing, but as mentioned, I saw 43 mpg observed.\n\nMake No Mistake, This Is a Pickup Truck\n\nFord says that from day one, it approached the Maverick like it approaches all its other pickups. The truck has to perform similar duties; it has to survive pickup truck tests; it will have a catalog of pickup truck accessories to customize it; and it will have things like FX4 Off-Road packages, as all Ford trucks do. Ford was so confident in its minitruck’s ability to truck that it even arranged an off-road course, a towing test and even one laden to maximum payload ratings to sample.\n\n2022 Ford Maverick | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nWithout anything in it, the Maverick is incredibly solid and controlled. The ride quality is exceptional; it’s on the firm side, like most pickup trucks, but bumps and expansion joints are soaked up with a single whump and little else — no bobbing motions, no rocking, no bouncing. It almost feels European in its chassis control and sophistication. Steering is also nicely weighted and gives excellent feedback; there’s none of the Santa Cruz’s video-game-like numbness in the steering wheel. It’s easy to hustle the Maverick along at higher speeds, as the body control, brakes and suspension all feel outstanding even on the base XL trim.\n\nI can say with confidence that either powertrain can handle a payload in its bed without batting an eye. The same goes for trailering — the hybrid can drag up to 2,000 pounds, but the EcoBoost turbo can tow up to 4,000 pounds when equipped with the trailer tow package (which includes things like a larger radiator, oil cooler and integrated electronic trailer brake controller in the dash). With the hybrid, I towed a pair of Jet Skis without any issue whatsoever. With the EcoBoost, I hauled a 2,600-pound Airstream Basecamp trailer and a 3,650-pound flatbed trailer with two quads strapped to it, and both performed beautifully, with no performance, acceleration, braking or stability issues. I sampled a hybrid variant with a full pallet of mulch in its bed and a turbo model with more than 1,000 pounds of bagged cement mix. Again, both performed flawlessly, making me wonder if they’re actually underrated for how much weight they could safely handle.\n\nAs for off-roading, the Maverick is available with an FX4 Off-Road Package, which brings a special off-road-tuned suspension, chunkier tires, more underbody skid plate protection, tow hooks and special modes for the drive selector. But Ford is quick to admit that despite these mods, the Maverick is not a very serious off-roading machine — it’s the thing you take to a campsite, but not beyond the campsite. In this regard, it’s more like the Bronco Sport and less like the big Bronco or the Ranger Tremor. As such, the off-road portion of the drive was mild, little more than a two-track path followed by a relaxed rocky hillclimb, both of which gave the Maverick no challenge whatsoever.\n\nWhat About That Other New Compact Pickup?\n\nThe question that’s going to be asked a lot is, “How does the Maverick stack up to the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz?” The new Santa Cruz is also a crossover-based compact … um … not-pickup, according to Hyundai, which has gone to great lengths to try and convince everyone it’s some kind of nebulous sport-lifestyle-activity vehicle — a thing for active young people who want a crossover but have dirty hobbies and don’t want to put their wetsuits/muddy boots/mountain bikes/fresh catch in the carpeted cargo area of an SUV. Sure, Jan.\n\n2022 Ford Maverick | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThere are some significant differences between the Maverick and Santa Cruz, however, and I don’t just mean the Santa Cruz-spaceship-versus-Maverick-trad-truck styling. The biggest might be in interior design: The Santa Cruz has a decidedly more expensive, upscale look and feel, with a far larger optional multimedia screen, more connectivity options (standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, for example), an available fully digital instrument cluster and more overall room inside than the Maverick.\n\nBut this is another result of the two trucks’ differing missions. Ford opted to prioritize bed space and utility over backseat passenger room, whereas Hyundai went the other way, giving the Santa Cruz a more spacious backseat but less useful cargo bed. Frankly, I think the Ford idea is the better way to go. The backseat passengers, when there are any, can be accommodated by front occupants adjusting their legroom as needed. But the bed space can’t be adjusted — it’s a fixed volume, so the manufacturer may as well maximize that utility and allow for adjustability in the interior instead.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Chicago Auto Show: Best in Show\n2022 Ford Maverick Vs. 2021 Ford Ranger: How Do Their Interiors Compare?\nChevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150, Ram 1500 Dealer Inventory: Where Are They Now?\nMore Ford News\nMore Pickup Truck News\nSealing the Deal With Screaming Value\n\nThe clincher for the Maverick might just be its price: It starts at $19,995 (which climbs to $21,490 when you add the eye-popping $1,495 destination fee). That’s nearly $4,000 less than the starting point of a Santa Cruz, but it does include less standard equipment. The three trim levels are XL, XLT and Lariat. A well-equipped XLT hybrid could run into the high $20,000 range. A loaded Lariat EcoBoost AWD with the Lariat Luxury Package and all the trimmings will top out at about $38,000. When the average price of a new car is now $41,000, the Maverick represents an absolutely jaw-dropping value.\n\nThe Maverick’s not perfect, of course. It’s not difficult to see where Ford cut corners to give us this screaming deal — you still have a twist-key in the XL and XLT trims (push-button start is available only in the Lariat), the buttons and switches for everything from climate controls and windows to turn signals and lights are the past generation of Ford parts-bin stuff from 2016, not the latest and greatest bits. There’s no cruise control at all on the XL trim, and the only standard advanced safety features are forward automatic emergency braking and automatic high beams; everything else is optional. The 8-inch multimedia screen is oddly dim and hard to read on bright, sunny days; that it’s also perfectly vertical and not raked at an angle at all doesn’t help, either.\n\nBut all of this frankly doesn’t seem to matter much because the Maverick’s whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It’s just so damned cool — it turns heads everywhere (especially in one of its eye-popping colors; where were these in the Mustang Mach-E palette?) and draws a crowd wherever it’s parked. On my drive, a young Tennessee bubba in scuffed steel-toed work boots got out of a lifted Toyota Tundra bro-dozer and begged to see more of it. So did a park ranger. So did an elderly gas station attendant. So did a group of young college girls on a Nashville street corner. Everybody loves the Maverick regardless of age, gender, occupation, just like the original ’65 Mustang. There’s nothing like the Maverick on the street right now — but like the Mustang copycats that showed up in the years following its bombshell launch in 1964, I don’t think you’ll have to wait long for Maverick clones to start appearing. The Ford Maverick is the ’65 Mustang for the 21st century.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ford Maverick?\n\nOne of only two truly compact pickup trucks currently on sale — the other being the Hyundai Santa Cruz — the Maverick is Ford’s most affordable vehicle. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine making 250 horsepower and 277 pounds-feet of torque, with an available hybrid powertrain that uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder for a combined 191 hp and 155 pounds-feet. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive is only available with the turbocharged 2.0-liter. Because it’s based on the platform of Ford’s compact Escape SUV, the Maverick doesn’t have the rugged structure of a body-on-frame pickup. Available FX4 and Tremor off-road packages, however, add rough-terrain capabilities via features like skid plates, front tow hooks, all-terrain tires and additional ground clearance.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ford Maverick?\n\nFor 2024, Ford has switched the places of the Maverick’s two engine offerings. The 2.5-liter hybrid engine that was standard for 2023 is now optional, and the formerly optional turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost is now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ford Maverick Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix-speaker audio system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSpray-in bedliner\nKeyless entry and start\nEight-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system\nOff-road suspension\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nEmergency steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Ford Maverick?\n\nThe 2024 Ford Maverick is a versatile canvas. The hybrid earned a 42/33/37 mpg city/highway/combined EPA rating, but we averaged 41.5 mpg over 200 miles of mixed driving in our own testing. The turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost can tow up to 4,000 pounds, while the hybrid maxes out at 2,000 pounds. The available Tremor Package brings a noteworthy increase in off-road ability, as well as some subtle but cool visual tweaks. The Maverick allows buyers to spec their truck to fit a range of priorities, but no matter the form, it’s affordable and highly desirable. When it debuted for 2022, we named it not only our Best Pickup Truck, but also Best of the Year among all new or significantly redesigned vehicles. It nabbed our Best Pickup Truck honor again for 2023.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Ford Maverick a Good Pickup Truck?\n\nSmall interior touches, a fresh face, a new Lobo performance trim level and the addition of available all-wheel drive for the existing hybrid drivetrain make the updated 2025 Ford Maverick one of the most compelling affordable vehicles on the market.\n\nHow Does the Ford Maverick Compare With Other Pickup Trucks?\n\nCompetition in the compact truck class is scarce in the U.S. For now, it’s just the Hyundai Santa Cruz facing down the Maverick, and the Ford is far, far more compelling from a presentation, packaging, capability and affordability standpoint.\n\nOh heck yeah. The 2025 Ford Maverick finally offers all-wheel drive with its hybrid powertrain, and there’s a new performance-oriented variant? Talk about listening to your customers. These major additions, along with a larger standard infotainment screen and some minor stylistic tweaks, significantly elevate what was already one of the most compelling sub-$30,000 vehicles on the market.\n\nRelated: 2025 Ford Maverick: Mini Truck, Max Utility\n\nWhat Engine Does the Ford Maverick Hybrid Have?\n\nLet’s kick it off with the hybrid. The powertrain is untouched, the core of which remains a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine augmented by a transmission-mounted electric motor, a setup Ford calls an “eCVT.”  Unlike traditional belt-driven continuously variable transmissions, Ford’s eCVT is simply a planetary gearset with an integrated electric motor, making it both simpler and more robust than its belted cousins.\n\nThat’s old news, as that’s been in the front-wheel-drive Maverick hybrid since day one. Now, this same powertrain can incorporate a mechanical clutch and driveshaft that routes power to the rear wheels when slippage is detected. This is a welcome alternative to the e-AWD systems found in some hybrid models like the popular Toyota RAV4 Hybrid; though certainly effective in some environments, the rear-electric-motor-based e-AWD system has proven less flexible and adaptive than the classic driveshaft-based setup.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Does the Ford Maverick Hybrid Drive?\n\nNot that you’ll notice much difference during day-to-day driving. After putting close to 1,000 miles on a FWD Maverick hybrid when it launched a few years ago, the differences in character with the new AWD system are nearly imperceptible. And, that’s just the way I like it; the FWD electro-Mav remains one of the better-driving affordable hybrids on the market.\n\nThe handoff between the initial surge from the electric motor to the gas four-cylinder is near-seamless, with the combined 191 horsepower providing more than enough gumption for relatively confident merging and attentive passing. It ain’t quick, but there’s plenty of motivation for virtually any daily scenario, even while hauling a passenger or two.\n\nIf you do end up constantly burying the accelerator pedal, you won’t simultaneously reach for hearing protection as you might in other budget-oriented, CVT-backed vehicles. The 2.5-liter engine is well isolated from the cabin, and the eCVT is less screamy than a traditional belt-driven CVT powertrain like the kind in, say, an autowriter’s personal Subaru Crosstrek Sport.\n\nBrake blend between pure regenerative resistance and the physical brakes is excellent, too. I believe the customer overlap between trucklet-seeking Maverick buyers and dedicated hybrid seekers is fairly narrow, so a low hybrid learning curve is ideal for the typical Maverick driver. Do you feel the mass of the AWD system’s extra 200-ish pounds? Maybe, but the bulk adds minimal heft to the Maverick’s crossover-like handling character, with the only thing reminding you of the truck bed out back is a glance at the rearview mirror.\n\nEverything else is right where you left it in 2024, including the terribly clever interior packaging and rugged materials. However, fuel efficiency does take a small hit when you jump from FWD to AWD, with EPA-estimated combined gas mileage dropping from 38 to 37 mpg.\n\nWhat Is the Ford Maverick Lobo?\n\nSo while the new AWD Maverick hybrid offers big benefits with little change in the truck’s real-world character, elsewhere in the lineup, the new Lobo sport trim seeks big change with its suite of performance-minded upgrades. It’s been repeated ad nauseam at this point, but think of the Maverick Lobo as a descendant of the sport compact trucks of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, a time when automakers infused small trucks like the Ford Ranger and Chevrolet S-10 with style and performance packages.\n\nNaturally, this followed the vibrant mini- and sport-truck subculture that saw passionate enthusiasts swappin’, slammin’ and airbrushing their trucks to match the contemporary hot-rodding trends. This era arguably hit its apogee in the ‘90s with the GMC Syclone and first-generation Ford F-150 Lightning, where power and presence were prioritized over handling.\n\nThe Maverick Lobo switches this up. It’s offered exclusively with the Mav’s available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 250 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque, but this engine’s familiar eight-speed automatic transmission has been replaced with a seven-speed automatic shared with the European Focus ST. Also from the Focus are the front twin-piston brake calipers, complemented by a revised steering rack and a suspension drop of 0.5 inches in the front and just over 1.1 inches in the rear that adds both stiffness and visual rake.\n\nThe Lobo also uses the twin-clutch rear differential from the Maverick Tremor and certain iterations of the Bronco Sport — and, if you go back far enough, you can trace some of its DNA from the bygone Focus RS. The differential’s torque-vectoring capability is active when the track-focused Lobo mode is engaged. Lobo mode also reduces stability-system intervention.\n\nIs the Ford Maverick Lobo Fast?\n\nAll this and some style thanks to a unique front end, special interior accents, body-color trim and wicked monobloc-style 19-inch wheels. It’s quite the compelling sport trucklet on paper and in person, but I’m afraid it’s far from the hot hatch (hot tailgate?) both myself and other enthusiasts wished for.\n\nDespite the new transmission, the Lobo feels no quicker in a straight line than a regular turbocharged Maverick, which accelerated from 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds when we last tested a 2022 model. The engine sounds a bit gruffer when on the move, but the tone is neither very aggressive nor particularly “cool.” Steering is modestly improved in terms of weight and feel, and the reworked suspension does cut down on some body roll, but the Lobo still feels very much like a vehicle forced to exercise when it really, really doesn’t want to.\n\nRainy conditions meant I didn’t get to smash ‘n scream through an autocross course, but a good eight or so hot laps riding shotgun with a Ford dynamics engineer proved its capability is indeed elevated above a non-Lobo Maverick. Still, it’s also no match for any hot hatch.\n\nI asked one of the Ford engineers why the Lobo doesn’t wear the vaunted ST badge, considering the automaker’s Explorer three-row SUV offers an ST variant. He told me the ST development team is a close-knit one and that there are internal directives and checklists that an ST product must meet for approval. Considering the semi-parts-bin nature of the Lobo treatment, it starts to make sense.\n\nI’m glad the Lobo exists, and I’m sure there are plenty of Ford and Maverick enthusiasts who are counting down the minutes until their order is fulfilled, but I wish it went a bit further — especially with the Focus RS’ 350-hp, turbo 2.3-liter four-cylinder sitting right there. Alternatively, I bet there’s a way to crank the truck’s turbo 2.0-liter up a bit.\n\nActually, I’m sure of it, and I think Ford is, as well. The Lobo feels purpose-built for the nascent Maverick tuning community, and I expect the aftermarket will have an absolute field day with the long-proven powertrain. This makes a whole lot more sense to me than how the Lobo is right out of the box; get some real tires, a bigger suspension drop, a reflash, a gnarly turbo and a comprehensive exhaust, and you should be picking on Ford Mustang GTs in no time.\n\nDon’t get it twisted — the Lobo is still a Maverick, which means it’s a fantastic little truck. It still possesses all the brilliant packaging, excellent ‘round-town usability and weekend-warrior utility that’s ensconced it as Ford’s affordable giga-hit. Now, with a sport-oriented trim sitting pretty with the off-road Tremor, luxe Lariat and AWD hybrid models, there’s truly a Maverick for everyone.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ford Maverick Lobo: The Return of the Street Truck\n2025 Ford Maverick Up Close: It Just Keeps Getting Better\nFord Recalls 144,000-Plus Maverick Trucks for Rearview Camera Malfunction\nResearch Ford Vehicles\nShop for a 2025 Ford Maverick Near You\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Ford Maverick compact pickup truck may be one of the hottest commodities on the market even as it enters its second model year. For 2023, Ford gives the Maverick an off-road Tremor Off-Road Package all its own, an upgrade over the off-road-adjacent FX4 Off-Road Package. Previously appearing on the F-150, F-Series Super Duty and Ranger, the Tremor package improves each truck’s off-roading capabilities without going to the extremes of a Raptor in terms of capabilities or appearance. The Maverick Tremor in particular gets a more advanced all-wheel-drive system, a 1-inch increase in ride height, knobbier tires and subtle appearance tweaks. Since it has AWD, the Maverick Tremor is exclusively powered by the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine; no hybrid off-roading here. The Maverick Tremor Off-Road Package is available on XLT or Lariat trims for $2,995.\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Maverick Tremor Up Close: Dirtier and Loving It\n\nI drove a Maverick XLT Tremor in the Chicago area; unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to drive it off-road, though readers familiar with driving around Chicago will know I encountered plenty of bumps and obstacles. Given how infrequently most buyers will actually take the Maverick Tremor (or any off-road vehicle) off-road, plus how it’s targeted as a city-friendly truck, it’s still worth asking how the package affects on-road ride quality and handling — and if it’s worth the added cost.\n\nMostly Enjoyable On-Road\n\nOff-road packages are some of my favorites to drive around the city because off-road suspensions usually handle bumps and potholes especially well, and the Maverick Tremor is no exception. While regular Mavericks have issues with impact harshness, the Tremor’s off-road suspension and Falken Wildpeak A/T tires provide significantly more cushioning for the driver and passengers. The increased ride height also makes for a more confident driver seating position — not by much, of course, but I didn’t feel dwarfed by compact SUVs the way I sometimes do in our long-term Maverick Lariat hybrid.\n\nHandling doesn’t feel especially different from a regular Maverick. The Maverick Tremor is not sports car precise, but it’s not as vague as some compact SUVs I’ve driven and not vaguer than a regular Maverick, which is occasionally a problem with off-road versions of trucks or older pickups. There’s a bit more body roll in the Tremor because of its taller ride height and suspension, but the changes aren’t so drastic that the Tremor wallows from side to side the way an F-150 Raptor with all of its additional suspension travel can.\n\nDriving the Maverick Tremor also confirmed a feeling I’d developed while testing two front-wheel-drive Mavericks: AWD versions launch better from a stop. While FWD Mavericks don’t have a lot of torque steer (when the truck pulls left or right during acceleration), they struggle to handle abrupt power delivery with wheelspin when unloaded in a way that this AWD Maverick doesn’t. A loaded FWD EcoBoost Maverick also had a scary amount of wheel hop during acceleration testing. I don’t think a Maverick Tremor would be the quickest Maverick in the lineup with its added weight and less street-oriented tires, and I’m not even sure an AWD Maverick EcoBoost without any off-road package would be quicker than a FWD one because of the weight, but I enjoyed the cleaner launches.\n\nWe’ve called the Maverick Tremor a Bronco Sport Badlands with a bed given it borrows the SUV’s AWD system, but there’s an added bonus: a longer wheelbase. I took the Maverick Tremor down a stretch of rough road that had practically bounced me out of my seat in a Bronco Sport Badlands. I felt all the bumps in the Tremor, but the truck remained composed. I can’t ascribe all of that to the Maverick Tremor’s 16-inch-longer wheelbase, but it certainly helps improve the ride compared to Ford’s other similarly priced off-road offering.\n\nThere are three notable issues with driving the Maverick Tremor around town. First, the turbocharged four-cylinder engine is just not a very pleasant-sounding type of engine to my ear, and more affordable vehicles such as the Maverick tend to have less sound deadening than other turbo four-cylinder vehicles. Second, the knobby tires produce more noise and vibrations than the street tires on other Mavericks; again, this isn’t unusual for off-road trims and it’s not as noisy as larger off-road vehicles, but it’s still noticeable. Finally, fuel efficiency is not the Maverick Tremor’s strong suit: Observed fuel economy in city-leaning mixed driving with temps in the high 20s to low 30s hovered in the mid- to high teens. More city driving will lower fuel economy, but when I got in the truck with a nearly full tank, it predicted I had just over 300 miles of driving range. EcoBoost-powered 2022 Mavericks with AWD are rated by the EPA at 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined, but the agency hasn’t yet provided 2023 Maverick ratings. Buyers may not be concerned about fuel economy, but after seeing the stellar economy of our FWD hybrid Maverick, numbers like this are disappointing.\n\nLest you think the Maverick Tremor is just a lift kit, it also gets Tremor-specific upgrades like a heavier-duty transmission cooler, upgraded half-shafts, off-road-specific drive modes for mud, sand and snow, and a new AWD system with a rear differential that can send nearly all the torque to the right or left wheel, or lock the rear wheels, for maximum traction. It also gets revised front styling that significantly improves its approach angle to 30.7 degrees from 21.6. While I didn’t get to take the Maverick Tremor off-roading, it has the tools to be capable. In the same way that the Maverick can do enough “truck” things like towing and hauling for most people, the Maverick Tremor seems likely to handle most off-road situations.\n\nSpeaking of truck things, an added consequence of the Maverick Tremor is that its payload capacity is slightly reduced. Ford lists its maximum capacity at 1,200 pounds, down from 1,500 pounds max in other Mavericks; our test vehicle’s maximum capacity, including occupants, was listed at 1,225 pounds. Towing capacity also maxes out at 2,000 pounds, the same as a standard Maverick; while non-Tremor AWD Mavericks can add a towing package that doubles capacity to 4,000, it’s not available with the Tremor Off-Road Package.\n\nLooks the Part\n\nThe added ride height is both noticeable and an improvement, and the new fascia adds a small dose of aggression to the Maverick. I also appreciate that the standard Tremor visual upgrades, in the form of orange accents on the grille, unique wheels with orange accents and “Tremor” graphics on the rear fenders, are rather subtle. Our test vehicle came with the $1,495 Tremor Appearance Package, which adds to the Tremor Off-Road Package graphics and, on the Lariat, additional gray exterior accents. I’m firmly in the “skip it” camp; while it costs less than the Maverick’s $1,645 Black Appearance Package, the graphics don’t look good to me and there’s no cost reduction if you add the package to an XLT despite its fewer changes to that trim. But if you like it, go for it, and make your truck look exactly how you want it to look.\n\nInside, the front seats have unique stitched “Tremor” logos and the drive mode selector button has an orange “Tremor” logo, as well. There are also some new buttons for the AWD system and the differential lock. That’s about it. It’s still very much a Maverick inside, so materials quality is on the cheaper side but it’s still visually interesting. There’s no change to seat comfort front or back, either. I don’t really like the seats for longer drives, but some of our, uh, narrower editors have fewer complaints. The backseat is roomy enough for adults, but beware: It’s not roomy enough for adults and stuff, and without a bed cover, there’s not much secure space to store cargo.\n\nMore From Cars.com\n\nIs the Ford Maverick’s EcoBoost Engine’s Performance Worth Its MPG Penalty?\nBest Car Features for Tailgating in 2022\n2022 Ford Maverick Real-World Fuel Economy: Extraordinary Achievements\n6 Months With a 2022 Ford Maverick: Is It Still Our Top Gun?\nPicking a Bed Cover for Our 2022 Ford Maverick Hybrid\nWorth the Cost?\n\nThe $2,995 it takes to get these off-road upgrades make the Maverick Tremor Off-Road Package feel like a capable truck for the money, and our XLT test vehicle rang in at a reasonable $33,335 including the skippable appearance package. I’m not certain it’s worth the trade-offs, however. If you’re a buyer who drives on rough or unpaved roads constantly, there’s certainly some value in the package, but a regular AWD Maverick or even a FWD one can probably survive the same sort of day-to-day driving, albeit with reduced comfort.\n\nPayload also takes a hit with the Tremor package, and towing is limited despite its AWD EcoBoost powertrain. Those are two of the Maverick’s best qualities, and losing some of that capability isn’t ideal.  And while I think this is the most enjoyable Maverick I’ve driven around the city, it’s not so much better than Cars.com’s long-term Maverick hybrid that I’d be willing to sacrifice that much fuel efficiency.\n\nMore variety in a vehicle lineup is almost always a good thing, but while Ford seems set on offering a Maverick for every lifestyle, not every Maverick can meet every need. Buyers should conduct their own cost-benefit analysis to see if the Maverick Tremor is the right Maverick for their needs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
