      "expert_review": "Can a big van be chic? \nChances are you might say yes after taking a look at Ford’s Econoline Club Wagon Chateau, the luxury version of Ford’s recently redesigned full-size van. \nFord has overhauled the Econoline for 1992. It is no longer a      utilitarian brick on wheels. There’s a more aerodynamic front end, a better interior and something rarely found in a big van: class. \nThis is a people-mover par excellence. \nComfortable and quiet, the Club Wagon can be ordered with a variety of      engines and transmissions, and it can be outfitted to transport as many as 15 passengers. \nPERFORMANCE \nThe test vehicle came with Ford’s 200-horsepower 5.8-liter V-8 and four-speed automatic, a drivetrain that provided reasonable performance and    excellent fuel economy. \nOn a trip from Orlando to Naples – about 235 miles – the 4,500-pound van got nearly 18 miles per gallon, terrific for such a large vehicle. \nThere’s ample power for passing slower traffic and hustling onto the interstate.    \nOnce cruising speed is reached, the engine – located under a cover between and slightly ahead of the front seats – becomes nearly inaudible. When accelerating, though, you can hear the engine more so than in a passenger car, but it is not distracting. \nThe column-mounted shift lever has a push button for the overdrive located at the tip of the shifter, a nice touch. I never accidentally turned overdrive off or on. \nHANDLING \nAt more than 17 feet in length, the Club Wagon Chateau is the biggest vehicle I have ever tested. However, its size does not make it unwieldy. \nThe power-assisted steering is light but has a solid feel, and the van can turn a tight circle for a vehicle its size. Ford says the turning radius is 46.6 feet, so making a      tight U-turn presents no problem. \nThe Club Wagon has a soft ride, but it isn’t bouncy. The big van cruises over rough pavement, while isolating the trauma and noise from the interior. \nStopping the Club Van are heavy-duty power-assisted disc/ drum  brakes with an anti-lock system installed on the rear. \nDuring the trip to Naples, I got caught in a rainstorm, and that uncovered what may be the Club Wagon’s only bad habit: The rear wheels lose traction easily on slippery surfaces. \nThis doesn’t  mean the Club Wagon is dangerous or that it won’t stay on the road. It means that in certain situations, such as pulling out of a wet parking lot on a slight incline, the rear wheels will spin easily unless you proceed with a light foot. \nThe           Econoline’s fuel tank is not mounted over the rear axle as it is on many other full-size vans. So, there is not as much weight over the rear wheels to keep them from spinning on wet roads. Perhaps a better set of tires or a traction control system would   help. Traction control prevents wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces; it’s the opposite of anti-lock brakes. \nFIT AND FINISH \nFord engineers really                                                                                                  did a great job inside the Club Wagon. For starters, it’s the only full-size van you can buy with a driver’s side air bag. \nThe analog instruments are clear and easy to read. Switches, buttons and controls for the air conditioning, radio and            accessories are easy to locate on the Econoline’s huge dash and they are simple to use. \nA large storage compartment under the center of the dash can hold most small parcels. An auxiliary air conditioner for rear passengers gives each person his or her own outlet, much like on an airplane. \nThe test van had seating for seven, two bucket seats up front, two in the middle, and a bench in the rear that can be folded into a bed. \nVisibility is good up front because the view is unobscured by the hood,  but the view is not as good through the small square windows in the rear swing-open doors. Two huge rear-view mirrors help compensate. \nAll passengers are likely to find that there is more than enough room. The interior is simply c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      vernous. \nAnother big improvement involves the way the two front doors open. Instead of swinging straight open, the doors also swing out and down slightly. You still have to step up into the van, but getting in and out is very easy because the doors    open so wide. \nThe Econoline has been named Motor Trend’s ”Truck of the Year.” Since being introduced in 1962, Ford has sold more than 6 million. Ford spokesman Jim Treanor says the company thinks it will sell 225,000 Econolines this year. \nFord’s big van is available with a menu of engines that range from a 4.9-liter straight six to a 7.3-liter diesel. There’s also another body, one that is even longer. The ”Super Van” model adds almost two more feet in length. \nSince hitting the streets late last year, sales of the new Econoline have been strong.",
