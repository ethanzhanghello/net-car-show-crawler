      "expert_review": "I’m a little guy who normally hauls little stuff. I often look foolish in big trucks with big engines, especially in city traffic. But I get paid to drive them.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed in my years of writing about cars and trucks is that lots of little guys worldwide spend their workdays hauling little stuff — usually in congested cities where big pickup trucks and vans make little sense. They use little trucks, or other smallish conveyances that better fit their work and living environments.\n\nOne of those little trucks, in wide use in Western Europe, is the Ford Transit Connect. It has an appearance reminiscent of the Colorado River basin’s humpback chub, a small fish with a long snout and a pronounced hump behind its head.\n\nThe humpback chub is built more for maneuvering between rock crevices and through other small spaces than it is for speed. The design of the Transit Connect is based on a similar concept. It is meant to move efficiently through man-made canyons of concrete and steel — to pick up and deliver without appreciably worsening the congestion found in those places.\n\nBut the Transit Connect, equipped with a 2-liter four-cylinder engine (136 horsepower, 128 foot-pounds of torque), also fares well on expressways and highways, assuming it’s driven with a modicum of common sense. That means maintaining residence in the slower lanes — right and middle. It means staying out of the acceleration lane, the left lane, unless it is absolutely necessary to use that strip.\n\nI fell in love with the Transit Connect in London and Rome, where I noticed its ability to deliver and collect goods with much greater ease than larger trucks. The little trucks were in and out of pickup and delivery spots in a fraction of the time of the big trucks, many of which were carrying similar amounts and types of packaged and bundled goods.\n\nThe Transit Connect simply makes more sense in urban spaces. It’s to Ford’s credit that its executives have overcome the bigger-is-better mentality of the truck market in the United States and brought the Transit Connect here.\n\nIt’s also a risky business decision in an environment where the urban transportation of anything, including flowers, seems to require a medium-size or large truck, van, or sport-utility vehicle with six, eight or more cylinders.\n\nMaybe, now that “going green” is American chic, the little Transit Connect has a chance of making it in a country that grew fat and rich by supersizing everything from hamburgers to houses.\n\nI hope so.\n\nI drove a 2010 Transit Connect panel van for a week and am eagerly looking forward to driving future models, especially if Ford decides to bring a diesel version to these shores.\n\nToday’s advanced diesel engines come with low tailpipe and noise pollution. They also are 30 percent more fuel-efficient than gasoline-powered models. Installed in the Transit Connect, that means a delivery truck with big utility, a small footprint, reduced tailpipe and noise pollution, and increased fuel efficiency in an urban setting.\n\nThere also is the possibility of a gas-electric hybrid, or an all-electric model.\n\nAm I proselytizing here? Yes.\n\nNot all trucks need long wheelbases, wide tracks or body-on-frame construction. Not all of them need six-, eight- or 10-cylinder engines. It’s time to end automotive overkill in the nation’s cities. The Transit Connect is a way to start.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nFord’s “One Ford” strategy, which refers to the company’s plan to leverage its global product lineup to spread models across new markets, is responsible for bringing the Transit Connect stateside. It’s a small commercial van Ford introduced in Europe and other markets in 2003. Maximum cargo space is about 130 cubic feet, close to that of larger minivans. Ford says it made a few styling tweaks to suit the U.S. market, but the Transit Connect’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder — the sort of engine you’d find in a compact car — speaks more to Europe’s fuel prices than to America’s penchant for horsepower. With a second row of seats, the Transit Connect can hold up to five people.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Transit Connect comes in cargo and passenger configurations, the latter with a second row.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nThe Transit Connect isn’t very long from nose to tail, but its height allows for the cavernous interior. At 180.6 inches long, the van is significantly longer than hatchbacks like the Scion xB, but it’s nearly 2 feet shorter than large minivans like the Dodge Grand Caravan. Total height, at nearly 80 inches, tops the minivan by almost a foot. Exterior features include:\n\n\nSliding second-row doors available with or without windows\nRear doors swing open 180 degrees or (optionally) 255 degrees\nStandard 15-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has basic seats and plenty of hard, industrial-looking surfaces. Storage areas include a large shelf above the windshield made possible by the van’s high ceiling. From the load floor to the ceiling, Ford says there’s up to 59.1 inches of room, just 5.9 inches short of what a standard-height Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers.\n\nIn passenger versions, the second row can be configured with two seats grouped to one side or three seats across. They can be folded down to maximize cargo room. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo\nOptional power windows and door locks\nOptional Crew Chief telematics can manage vehicle-fleet information\nOptional interior customization to manage cargo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 136 horsepower and 128 pounds-feet of torque. Small numbers, but enough to haul a 1,600-pound payload, according to Ford. That’s a figure comparable to many light-duty pickup trucks. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nFour-speed automatic transmission\nUses regular gas\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nFront disc and rear drum antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with rollover mitigation\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nFord’s “One Ford” strategy, which refers to the company’s plan to leverage its global product lineup to spread models across new markets, is responsible for bringing the Transit Connect stateside. It’s a small commercial van Ford introduced in Europe and other markets in 2003. Maximum cargo space is about 135 cubic feet, close to that of larger minivans. Ford says it made a few styling tweaks to suit the U.S. market, but the Transit Connect’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder — the sort of engine you’d find in a compact car — speaks more to Europe’s fuel prices than to America’s penchant for horsepower. With a second row of seats, the Transit Connect can hold up to five people.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Transit Connect comes in cargo and passenger configurations, the latter with a second row.\n\nNew for 2012\nAn electronic stability system with Ford’s Roll Stability Control is now standard on all models. Also, the Transit Connect wagon’s gas mileage increases to 22/27 mpg city/highway from 21/26 mpg thanks to revised gearing and low-rolling-resistance tires.\n\nExterior\nThe Transit Connect isn’t very long from nose to tail, but its height allows for the cavernous interior. At 180.6 inches long, the van is significantly longer than hatchbacks like the Scion xB, but it’s nearly 2 feet shorter than large minivans like the Dodge Grand Caravan. Total height, at nearly 80 inches, tops the minivan by almost a foot. Exterior features include:\n\n\nSliding second-row doors available with or without windows\nRear doors swing open 180 degrees or (optionally) 255 degrees\nStandard 15-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has basic seats and plenty of hard, industrial contours. Storage areas include a large shelf above the windshield made possible by the van’s high ceiling. From the load floor to the ceiling, Ford says there’s up to 59.1 inches of room, just 5.9 inches short of what a standard-height Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers.\n\nIn passenger versions, the second row can be configured with two seats grouped to one side or three seats across. They can be folded down to maximize cargo room. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo\nOptional power windows and door locks\nOptional Ford Work Solutions system, which can track inventory and fleet vehicles\nOptional interior customization to manage cargo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 136 horsepower and 128 pounds-feet of torque. Small numbers, but enough to haul a 1,600-pound payload, according to Ford. That’s a figure comparable to many light-duty pickup trucks. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nFour-speed automatic transmission\nUses regular gas\n\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags for the front seats\nStandard front disc and rear drum antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system with rollover mitigation\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s “One Ford” strategy, which refers to the company’s plan to leverage its global product lineup to spread models across new markets, is responsible for bringing the Transit Connect stateside. It’s a small commercial van Ford introduced in Europe and other markets in 2003. Maximum cargo space is about 135 cubic feet, close to that of larger minivans. Ford says it made a few styling tweaks to suit the U.S. market, but the Transit Connect’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder — the sort of engine you’d find in a compact car — speaks more to Europe’s fuel prices than to America’s penchant for horsepower.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Transit Connect comes in cargo and passenger configurations, the latter with a second row. Trim levels include a base XL and a better-equipped XLT.\n\nNew for 2011\nFord adds a taxi prep package and a package for people with disabilities, as well as an online custom graphics program.\n\nExterior\nThe Transit Connect isn’t very long from nose to tail, but its height allows for the cavernous interior. At 180.6 inches long, the van is significantly longer than hatchbacks like the Chevy HHR and Scion xB, but it’s nearly 2 feet shorter than minivans like the Honda Odyssey, Dodge Grand Caravan and Toyota Sienna. Total height, at nearly 80 inches, tops the minivans by almost a foot. Exterior features include:\n\nSliding second-row doors available with or without windows\nRear doors swing open 180 degrees or (optionally) 255 degrees\nStandard 15-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has basic seats and plenty of hard, industrial contours. Storage areas include a large shelf above the windshield made possible by the van’s high ceiling. From the load floor to the ceiling, Ford says there’s up to 59.1 inches of room, just 5.9 inches short of what a standard-height Dodge Sprinter offers.\n\nIn passenger versions, the second row can be configured with two seats grouped to one side or three seats across. They can be folded down to maximize cargo room. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo\nOptional power windows and door locks\nOptional Ford Work Solutions system, which can track inventory and fleet vehicles\nOptional interior customization to manage cargo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 136 horsepower and 128 pounds-feet of torque. Small numbers, but enough to haul a 1,600-pound payload, according to Ford. That’s a figure comparable to many light-duty pickup trucks.\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission is standard. Ford estimates combined city/highway gas mileage will be in the low to mid-20s.\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard front-and side-impact airbags\nStandard front disc and rear drum antilock brakes\nAn electronic stability system with rollover mitigation standard on passenger version and optional on the cargo van",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2014 Ford Transit Connect wagon is a people-carrying version of Ford’s Transit Connect cargo van. The small Transit Connect wagon can carry up to seven occupants in three rows and has new conveniences similar to a minivan or crossover SUV. \n\nA short-wheelbase model has room for five occupants in two rows, while the longer-wheelbase model has three rows and room for seven. The Transit Connect wagon features sliding doors like a minivan, has a payload capacity of up to 1,200 pounds and is powered by a choice of two engines offering up to an estimated 30 mpg on the highway.  \n\nNew for 2014\nThe Transit Connect wagon is more than a cargo van with seats for 2014. An all-new interior and redesigned exterior give the wagon a less-commercial look compared to previous wagon versions. It now features some of the conveniences of a minivan or crossover, such as available navigation, advanced multimedia systems, big sunroofs and different trim levels. Newly available is a turbocharged 1.6-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine with estimated mileage up to 30 mpg on the highway. \nExterior\nWith a utilitarian box shape, the Transit Connect wagon still has the profile of a commercial vehicle with a tall roof to fit as much inside as possible. Seven-passenger models are about as long as a Toyota Highlander at 189.7 inches, while five-passenger models measure 173.9 inches, which is shorter than a Honda CR-V.\n\n\nAvailable exterior features include rain-sensing wipers, heated washer jets, panoramic sunroof, and a choice of a rear liftgate or symmetrical hinged doors. Wheel choices are 16 or 17 inches, and the wagon can tow up to 2,000 pounds.\nInterior\nInside is where Ford makes the biggest transformation of the Transit Connect wagon. A fully-trimmed interior has carpet, available heated leather seats and other conveniences new to the Transit Connect wagon, which previously was similar a commercial van with seats mounted in the cargo area. The dashboard and other interior trimmings mirror what non-commercial family offerings from Ford.  \n\n\nIn seven-passenger models, the second and third rows fold flat for an estimated 100-plus cubic feet of cargo volume, which is more than Ford’s own Flex at 83.2 cubic feet. Available interior options include MyFord Touch multimedia system with 6.5-inch touch-screen, voice-activated Sync multimedia system and navigation.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Optional is a turbocharged 1.6-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine with six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nThe Transit Connect wagon features six standard airbags, including side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating, plus standard electronic stability system, antilock brakes and available MyKey system that can limit the vehicle speed and stereo volume for other drivers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nOffered in cargo- and passenger-carrying forms, the Transit Connect is Ford’s compact van. A short-wheelbase version has room for five people in two rows, while the long-wheelbase model has three rows and room for up to seven. The Transit Connect has minivan-style sliding doors and can be powered by a gas four-cylinder or a turbo-diesel engine. Competitors include the Ram ProMaster City.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nThe Transit Connect has been refreshed for 2019. Changes include a new standard 162-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. A new turbo-diesel four-cylinder is available. Front-end styling changes include a new grille and headlights.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford Transit Connect Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features on the XL passenger van include air conditioning, cloth upholstery, cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and rear parking sensors.\n\nAvailable features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, navigation, wireless device charging, leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, push-button start, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nEven in passenger-carrying form, the Transit Connect more closely resembles a utility van than one of the minivans offered by competing automakers. It’s not as easy as a traditional minivan to convert from passenger- to cargo-carrying duty, but it does offer good passenger space, a low load floor and numerous versions to fit specific needs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nOffered in cargo- and passenger-carrying forms, the Transit Connect is Ford’s compact van. The long-wheelbase passenger version has three rows and room for up to seven people. The Transit Connect has minivan-style sliding doors and is powered by a gas four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Ram ProMaster City.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nAutomatic headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers are now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Ford Transit Connect Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features on the XL passenger van include air conditioning, cloth upholstery, cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and rear parking sensors.\n\nAvailable features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, navigation, wireless device charging, leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, push-button start, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane-keeping assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Ford Transit Connect?\n\nEven in passenger-carrying form, the Transit Connect more closely resembles a utility van than one of the minivans offered by competing automakers. It’s not as easy as a traditional minivan to convert from passenger- to cargo-carrying duty, but it does offer good passenger space, a low load floor and numerous versions to fit specific needs.",
