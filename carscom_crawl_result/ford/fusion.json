      "expert_review": "Trying to decide on a midsize sedan may be one of the hardest tasks for any car shopper. From the Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry to the redesigned Nissan Altima and Honda Accord, these cars offer quiet cabins, plenty of space and a fair amount of features even in base or lower trim levels.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion breaks away from the pack in a big way. It outhandles the entire field and has a design that is James Bond dashing while the rest would be best fit for Miss Moneypenny.\n\nIf midsize sedan shoppers want fun and style, the redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion is perhaps the only option they have, but it does come with a few tradeoffs.\n\nThe 2013 is significantly different from the outgoing 2012 in terms of not just performance and technology but also size, inside and out. You can compare the two model years here.\n\nStyle\nFrom the Aston Martin look of its front end to the geometric design of the tail, the Fusion is an exercise in aggressive styling. That was the plan. The entire car was developed to preserve the styling designers had penned. When engineers needed to make the car larger, they still had to maintain the design’s aesthetics.\n\nThe design does translate to a high belt line, narrow windows and reduced visibility, though.\n\nPerformance\nThe looks may draw in shoppers, but an array of four engines — three of which are new for the Fusion — may be the hardest decision made at the dealership.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss the S and SE’s base engine, a carryover from 2012. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder produces 175 horsepower and gets an EPA-estimated 22/34 mpg city/highway and 26 mpg combined.\n\nNext up is the 178-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that achieves the best non-hybrid mileage at 25/37/29 mpg city/highway/combined with a six-speed manual transmission and EPA fuel economy estimates of 23/36/28 mpg with a six-speed automatic.\n\nReplacing the previous generation’s V-6 is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an impressive 240 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque that returns 22/33/26 mpg. It comes with an automatic transmission but is the only engine that can be teamed to optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThe turbo engines run on regular gas but premium is needed to achieve the posted horsepower ratings. Mileage is the same on regular or premium.\n\nFinally, there is a hybrid with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and electric motor producing a combined 188 hp and returning 47 mpg across the board in city, highway and combined mileage.\n\nI drove the three new powertrains over hundreds of miles in hilly Southern California and found the variety welcome, but each with its own quirks.\n\nThe 1.6-liter with an automatic will likely be the volume leader in terms of sales, but I found it the least interesting to drive. The power rating is below most of the competition, and it’s noticeable on the road. There is still ample passing power in highway situations, but it doesn’t feel nearly as robust as the Nissan Altima’s 182-hp four-cylinder engine. I was able to reconfirm my past experience on this point with a base Altima provided by Ford during the Fusion test drive.\n\nWith a manual transmission, the 1.6-liter is livelier, and downshifting to ascend curvy roads helps you appreciate the car’s impressive handling.\n\nNo matter which Ford Fusion I tested, it took curves with sports car aplomb. Even with low-rolling-resistance tires on all the Fusions — equipped with standard 16-inch or optional 17-, 18- or 19-inch wheels — there was ample grip. Steering feel on all the cars is exceptional: precise during dynamic turns and on point on straight stretches.\n\nThe 2.0-liter delivered considerably more power — obviously — and teamed with all-wheel drive was even more fun to pilot around California’s curvy roads. While I’d never turn down more power, I wish the 1.6 had a bit more so the 2.0 wouldn’t be a necessary option at all.\n\nThe ride in the 1.6 and 2.0 was tightly composed, showcasing the work that went into designing a global car that needs to meet the sporty desires of European customers, too. However, the car doesn’t sacrifice too much comfort. It’s not as soft as the Altima or Camry but on par with the Kia Optima over rough road surfaces. Road and wind noise fall in that same spectrum, as well.\n\nThe Altima may be the more comfortable cruiser, but when I took it on sharp turns at speed, my co-pilot and I leaned far out of our seats. Take the same turn in the Fusion, and you stick to your seat like there’s adhesive on the fabric. This is confidence-inspiring during fun drives through the mountains, but for the daily driver, I question if it will be a deciding factor.\n\nHybrid\nThe Fusion Hybrid might have been my favorite of the bunch because it felt like it had the mix of power I was looking for with a slightly suppler ride while still featuring that impressive steering feel and handling.\n\nThe fact that it’s rated at 47 mpg is just a bonus.\n\nFord also did a good job with the traits that often limit a hybrid’s appeal. The brakes felt good under foot with none of the soggy or unpredictable feedback you can find in other hybrids and fully electric vehicles.\n\nThe battery pack in the trunk was also well-executed. There is a noticeable hump that reduces cargo space from 16 cubic feet to 12 cubic feet, but it is designed like a shelf so that larger cargo can fit in the deeper well and other items like groceries, dry cleaning and smaller bags can go on the shelf. The rear seats also fold to create a flat floor with that shelf.\n\nFord wisely left the stand-out Fusion styling as-is for the hybrid. There are no aesthetic or visible aerodynamic tweaks on the exterior to help cheat the wind. The Fusion Hybrid does get a set of shutters that close during certain types of driving to help with aerodynamics. Located behind the car’s grille and radiator, the shutters reduce drag at higher speeds. All Fusions feature a significant amount of underbody shielding to decrease drag, but the Fusion Hybrid’s underside is almost entirely shielded.\n\nThese changes aid the hybrid powertrain in returning the impressive 47 mpg mileage. There is no EV driving mode, and the hybrid features a digital gauge cluster identical to that found in Fusions equipped with the optional MyFord Touch multimedia system. The Fusion Hybrid does carry over the previous generation’s familiar graphical leaves in the gauge cluster that grow as you drive more efficiently.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nInside, the 2013 Fusion benefits from a considerably longer wheelbase as well as about an additional inch of exterior overall length. Interior measurements for headroom, legroom, hip room and shoulder room are all competitive or near the top of the class. The legroom numbers proved true. There was plenty of space for me in both the driver and rear seats. Front headroom wasn’t an issue, but in the rear seats I felt like if I were an inch or two taller than my 5-foot-10 frame I might have some issues.\n\nBoth the fabric and leather seats I tested felt significantly firm but offered good support. After two hours of solid driving, my thirty-something back was feeling sore. My twenty-something co-driver had no back issues even after four hours of driving. But in my defense, I took my comparison test in the Altima at the two-hour mark, and its wider, softer seats felt therapeutic on my poor back.\n\nThe cabin materials are all of good quality and competitive for the class. The main issue for shoppers will be the ergonomics — and not just of the optional MyFord Touch system. Even the base console, which has physical buttons, sports dozens of them. And they’re small. They look slick and futuristic, but that doesn’t make a difference in their size. Luckily, knobs for stereo volume and tuning are large, and the small LCD screen and menus are straightforward.\n\nThe standard gauge cluster is also nice to look at with a sharp LCD screen between the analog gauges, a setup we’re seeing across the segment.\n\nI also liked the rather large cubby ahead of the shifter. It’s a bit far forward to reach easily while driving but is large enough to stash larger gear like sunglasses, wallets or smartphones.\n\nThere’s also a small cubby between the front seats that’s able to accommodate similar-sized objects, and it’s where you can plug devices into two USB ports.\n\nThe Fusion’s trunk is 16 cubic feet and gets most of the space from being deep, not wide, but there are small cutouts for golf clubs by either side of the lid opening. It holds up well against the Altima and Camry’s 15.4 cubic feet, Accord’s 15.8 cubic feet and Malibu’s 16.3 cubic feet.\n\nYou can compare the Fusion to the Accord, Altima and Camry here.\n\nFeatures\nThe Fusion comes relatively well-equipped with the base S model getting standard Bluetooth, Ford’s Sync system, power windows with express up and down for all windows, remote entry, body-colored mirrors and door handles, and a chrome grille at $22,495 (all prices include destination charges). But that’s with the 2.5-liter engine, and this is where pricing will become a problem for Ford in this very competitive segment.\n\nTo opt for the more fuel-efficient 1.6-liter you need to move up to the SE, and to equip it with an automatic, you’ll be paying a base price of $25,290. It’s $24,495 with a manual.\n\nThe Altima, Camry and Accord come standard with their most fuel-efficient engines and cost $22,280, $22,850 and $23,270, respectively, with automatic transmissions.\n\nAnd to confuse even regular Ford shoppers a bit, there’s no longer an SEL trim level. There is the base S, SE and Titanium. S comes only with the 2.5-liter engine. SE comes with the 2.5, 1.6 or 2.0, and the Titanium is equipped only with the 2.0.\n\nSimple enough, but if you want more features with the 1.6, you need to add option packages like an Appearance Package at $1,250 or the Luxury Package at $2,300.\n\nMyFordTouch is an option for the SE trim in the Technology Package at $1,000; it  also adds a backup camera and dual-zone temperature control. The Ford Fusion Titanium MyFordTouch comes with an upgraded 12-speaker Sony stereo, which I tested and found rather robust. That makes paying the $30,995 price a bit more palatable.\n\nThe touch-sensitive capacitive buttons on models without the Sony system are few and spread out a bit to make finding the right one easier since you can’t feel them blindly. The Sony system is busier with many more capacitive buttons — none of which feature an audible click or send a pulse of feedback through the panel to confirm you’ve actually achieved the desired result of your finger pressing. And to take this buttonless world to a new extreme, controls for the map lights in the roof console of all Fusion models are also capacitive touch.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Ford Fusion has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Fusion features a standard array of airbags and optional safety technology like lane departure warning and correction, backup sensors and cross-path detection.\n\nYou can see a list of safety features here.\n\nFusion in the Market\nThere is no denying it: The Ford Fusion carries a price premium in this class to get a competitive engine under the hood. That premium can be an easier pill to swallow because the hood and everything around it is just that good looking, and the car is that much fun to drive.\n\nThe lingering question is just how many midsize sedan shoppers out there want a fun-to drive sedan when they can get more comfort and value from a variety of well-reviewed cars from other automakers.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2012 about the 2013 Ford Fusion. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nTrying to decide on a midsize sedan may be one of the hardest tasks for any car shopper. From the Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry to the redesigned Nissan Altima and Honda Accord, these cars offer quiet cabins, plenty of space and a fair amount of features even in base or lower trim levels.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion breaks away from the pack in a big way. It outhandles the entire field and has a design that is James Bond dashing while the rest would be best fit for Miss Moneypenny.\n\nIf midsize sedan shoppers want fun and style, the redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion is perhaps the only option they have, but it does come with a few tradeoffs.\n\nThe 2013 is significantly different from the outgoing 2012 in terms of not just performance and technology but also size, inside and out. You can compare the two model years here.\n\nStyle\nFrom the Aston Martin look of its front end to the geometric design of the tail, the Fusion is an exercise in aggressive styling. That was the plan. The entire car was developed to preserve the styling designers had penned. When engineers needed to make the car larger, they still had to maintain the design’s aesthetics.\n\nThe design does translate to a high belt line, narrow windows and reduced visibility, though.\n\nPerformance\nThe looks may draw in shoppers, but an array of four engines — three of which are new for the Fusion — may be the hardest decision made at the dealership.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss the S and SE’s base engine, a carryover from 2012. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder produces 175 horsepower and gets an EPA-estimated 22/34 mpg city/highway and 26 mpg combined.\n\nNext up is the 178-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that achieves the best non-hybrid mileage at 25/37/29 mpg city/highway/combined with a six-speed manual transmission and 23/36/28 mpg with a six-speed automatic.\n\nReplacing the previous generation’s V-6 is a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an impressive 240 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque that returns 22/33/26 mpg. It comes with an automatic transmission but is the only engine that can be teamed to optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThe turbo engines run on regular gas but premium is needed to achieve the posted horsepower ratings. Mileage is the same on regular or premium.\n\nFinally, there is a hybrid with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and electric motor producing a combined 188 hp and returning 47 mpg across the board in city, highway and combined mileage.\n\nI drove the three new powertrains over hundreds of miles in hilly Southern California and found the variety welcome, but each with its own quirks.\n\nThe 1.6-liter with an automatic will likely be the volume leader in terms of sales, but I found it the least interesting to drive. The power rating is below most of the competition, and it’s noticeable on the road. There is still ample passing power in highway situations, but it doesn’t feel nearly as robust as the Nissan Altima’s 182-hp four-cylinder engine. I was able to reconfirm my past experience on this point with a base Altima provided by Ford during the Fusion test drive.\n\nWith a manual transmission, the 1.6-liter is livelier, and downshifting to ascend curvy roads helps you appreciate the car’s impressive handling.\n\nNo matter which Fusion I tested, it took curves with sports car aplomb. Even with low-rolling-resistance tires on all the Fusions — equipped with standard 16-inch or optional 17-, 18- or 19-inch wheels — there was ample grip. Steering feel on all the cars is exceptional: precise during dynamic turns and on point on straight stretches.\n\nThe 2.0-liter delivered considerably more power — obviously — and teamed with all-wheel drive was even more fun to pilot around California’s curvy roads. While I’d never turn down more power, I wish the 1.6 had a bit more so the 2.0 wouldn’t be a necessary option at all.\n\nThe ride in the 1.6 and 2.0 was tightly composed, showcasing the work that went into designing a global car that needs to meet the sporty desires of European customers, too. However, the car doesn’t sacrifice too much comfort. It’s not as soft as the Altima or Camry but on par with the Kia Optima over rough road surfaces. Road and wind noise fall in that same spectrum, as well.\n\nThe Altima may be the more comfortable cruiser, but when I took it on sharp turns at speed, my co-pilot and I leaned far out of our seats. Take the same turn in the Fusion, and you stick to your seat like there’s adhesive on the fabric. This is confidence-inspiring during fun drives through the mountains, but for the daily driver, I question if it will be a deciding factor.\n\nHybrid\nThe Fusion Hybrid might have been my favorite of the bunch because it felt like it had the mix of power I was looking for with a slightly suppler ride while still featuring that impressive steering feel and handling.\n\nThe fact that it’s rated at 47 mpg is just a bonus.\n\nFord also did a good job with the traits that often limit a hybrid’s appeal. The brakes felt good under foot with none of the soggy or unpredictable feedback you can find in other hybrids and fully electric vehicles.\n\nThe battery pack in the trunk was also well-executed. There is a noticeable hump that reduces cargo space from 16 cubic feet to 12 cubic feet, but it is designed like a shelf so that larger cargo can fit in the deeper well and other items like groceries, dry cleaning and smaller bags can go on the shelf. The rear seats also fold to create a flat floor with that shelf.\n\nFord wisely left the stand-out Fusion styling as-is for the hybrid. There are no aesthetic or visible aerodynamic tweaks on the exterior to help cheat the wind. The Fusion Hybrid does get a set of shutters that close during certain types of driving to help with aerodynamics. Located behind the car’s grille and radiator, the shutters reduce drag at higher speeds. All Fusions feature a significant amount of underbody shielding to decrease drag, but the Fusion Hybrid’s underside is almost entirely shielded.\n\nThese changes aid the hybrid powertrain in returning the impressive 47 mpg mileage. There is no EV driving mode, and the hybrid features a digital gauge cluster identical to that found in Fusions equipped with the optional MyFord Touch multimedia system. The Fusion Hybrid does carry over the previous generation’s familiar graphical leaves in the gauge cluster that grow as you drive more efficiently.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nInside, the 2013 Fusion benefits from a considerably longer wheelbase as well as about an additional inch of exterior overall length. Interior measurements for headroom, legroom, hip room and shoulder room are all competitive or near the top of the class. The legroom numbers proved true. There was plenty of space for me in both the driver and rear seats. Front headroom wasn’t an issue, but in the rear seats I felt like if I were an inch or two taller than my 5-foot-10 frame I might have some issues.\n\nBoth the fabric and leather seats I tested felt significantly firm but offered good support. After two hours of solid driving, my thirty-something back was feeling sore. My twenty-something co-driver had no back issues even after four hours of driving. But in my defense, I took my comparison test in the Altima at the two-hour mark, and its wider, softer seats felt therapeutic on my poor back.\n\nThe cabin materials are all of good quality and competitive for the class. The main issue for shoppers will be the ergonomics — and not just of the optional MyFord Touch system. Even the base console, which has physical buttons, sports dozens of them. And they’re small. They look slick and futuristic, but that doesn’t make a difference in their size. Luckily, knobs for stereo volume and tuning are large, and the small LCD screen and menus are straightforward.\n\nThe standard gauge cluster is also nice to look at with a sharp LCD screen between the analog gauges, a setup we’re seeing across the segment.\n\nI also liked the rather large cubby ahead of the shifter. It’s a bit far forward to reach easily while driving but is large enough to stash larger gear like sunglasses, wallets or smartphones.\n\nThere’s also a small cubby between the front seats that’s able to accommodate similar-sized objects, and it’s where you can plug devices into two USB ports.\n\nThe Fusion’s trunk is 16 cubic feet and gets most of the space from being deep, not wide, but there are small cutouts for golf clubs by either side of the lid opening. It holds up well against the Altima and Camry’s 15.4 cubic feet, Accord’s 15.8 cubic feet and Malibu’s 16.3 cubic feet.\n\nYou can compare the Fusion to the Accord, Altima and Camry here.\n\nFeatures\nThe Fusion comes relatively well-equipped with the base S model getting standard Bluetooth, Ford’s Sync system, power windows with express up and down for all windows, remote entry, body-colored mirrors and door handles, and a chrome grille at $22,495 (all prices include destination charges). But that’s with the 2.5-liter engine, and this is where pricing will become a problem for Ford in this very competitive segment.\n\nTo opt for the more fuel-efficient 1.6-liter you need to move up to the SE, and to equip it with an automatic, you’ll be paying a starting price of $25,290. It’s $24,495 with a manual.\n\nThe Altima, Camry and Accord come standard with their most fuel-efficient engines and cost $22,280, $22,850 and $23,270, respectively, with automatic transmissions.\n\nAnd to confuse even regular Ford shoppers a bit, there’s no longer an SEL trim level. There is the base S, SE and Titanium. S comes only with the 2.5-liter engine. SE comes with the 2.5, 1.6 or 2.0, and the Titanium is equipped only with the 2.0.\n\nSimple enough, but if you want more features with the 1.6, you need to add option packages like an Appearance Package at $1,250 or the Luxury Package at $2,300.\n\nMyFordTouch is an option for the SE trim in the Technology Package at $1,000; it  also adds a backup camera and dual-zone temperature control. The Titanium MyFordTouch comes with an upgraded 12-speaker Sony stereo, which I tested and found rather robust. That makes paying the $30,995 price a bit more palatable.\n\nThe touch-sensitive capacitive buttons on models without the Sony system are few and spread out a bit to make finding the right one easier since you can’t feel them blindly. The Sony system is busier with many more capacitive buttons — none of which feature an audible click or send a pulse of feedback through the panel to confirm you’ve actually achieved the desired result of your finger pressing. And to take this buttonless world to a new extreme, controls for the map lights in the roof console of all Fusion models are also capacitive touch.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Ford Fusion has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Fusion features a standard array of airbags and optional safety technology like lane departure warning and correction, backup sensors and cross-path detection.\n\nYou can see a list of safety features here.\n\nFusion in the Market\nThere is no denying it: The Fusion carries a price premium in this class to get a competitive engine under the hood. That premium can be an easier pill to swallow because the hood and everything around it is just that good looking, and the car is that much fun to drive.\n\nThe lingering question is just how many midsize sedan shoppers out there want a fun-to drive sedan when they can get more comfort and value from a variety of well-reviewed cars from other automakers.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Tossed into the deep end of the pool, the 2006 Ford Fusion seems to be a pretty good swimmer.\n\nAs Ford’s indirect replacement for the Taurus, and as arguably the best-prepared American-branded car in years to go after the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, the Fusion was sent into battle in what may be the most competent, contentious segment of the automotive market.\n\nNot only do you have the twin towers of the Accord and Camry, you also have potent competition from the breakthrough Hyundai Sonata, an aging but discounted Nissan Altima, plus competent second-tier challengers such as the Mitsubishi Galant, Kia Optima, Dodge Stratus, Chevrolet Malibu, Volkswagen Jetta and Pontiac G6. If you just want reasonably priced transportation in a four-door sedan, any will do. And we can’t forget the Fusion’s sibling, the Mercury Milan, and we certainly can’t discount the vehicle that provided the basic platform for the Fusion, the Mazda6, a Ford corporate cousin.\n\nSo why buy the Fusion instead of one of the other midsize sedans? There’s not one compelling reason, but the Fusion’s package — styling, interior, ride, power, handling — is all above average. Part of this is because of the Mazda6 chassis, which is much-praised, and deservedly so. Part of the Fusion’s success also stems from a nice job of conception, execution and follow-through by Ford.\n\nLet’s start with the outside. Although stunning from no angle, the car is handsome and reasonably distinctive from every angle. Ford says it’s inspired by its 427 concept car from a few years ago, but I don’t really see that. Still, especially in darker colors, this is a pretty car.\n\nInside, even in the base model, the Fusion looks more expensive than it is. Learning a lesson from the models that came before it — the Taurus, the Contour and even the Tempo — you have to pick the Fusion interior apart to find any real evidence of cost-cutting. Seats are comfortable; instruments and controls look upscale.\n\nRear-seat room is a little tight if you plan on hauling three adults back there regularly, but it’s no penalty box. Trunk space, at 15.8 cubic feet, is on the large side of average. The Fusion’s length of 190.2 inches, and width of 72.2 inches, is within an inch either way of both the Accord and Camry.\n\nThe standard engine is a 160-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder, and though I haven’t driven a Fusion with that engine, I have driven other models with it, and for its size, it’s a solid powerplant. The test Fusion, an SEL model, had an optional 3.0-liter Duratec V-6, with an eager 221 horsepower, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Other V-6s, such as those in the Camry and Accord may have more power, but the difference isn’t that noticeable. Mileage is EPA-rated at 21 mpg city, 29 mpg highway, and my overall average was right in the middle.\n\nOn the road, the Fusion is quiet, and the ride is supple. Steering is light and very well-balanced, almost to the point of feeling German. The Fusion SEL seemed very much at home when asked to drive hard through tight corners, aided substantially by comparatively aggressive P225/50R-17 radials.\n\nThe test car started at $21,710, and with shipping and options — including anti-lock brakes ($595, they really should be standard on this model), nice leather upholstery ($895), a “safety and security” package with an alarm and side air bags ($595), upgraded sound system ($420) and several smaller features — the bottom line was $25,650. For 2007, side air bags and the alarm will become standard, and all-wheel drive will be offered.\n\nThe base Fusion S starts at $17,795 with shipping, and it comes with only the four-cylinder engine, and at that price, a five-speed manual transmission. The midlevel SE offers the four-cylinder or the V-6, as does the SEL.\n\nIs there a compelling reason to choose a Fusion over the competition? Not really. But just as telling, though: There’s no compelling reason not to buy one. With so many good vehicles in this class, you can afford to indulge your tastes, as dictated by your bank account.\n\nVideo versions of Sentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s road tests are available at OrlandoSentinel.com/cars.",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Fusion is an undeniably stylish, athletic, fun-to-drive midsize sedan, but its interior appointments won’t match its exterior panache unless you’re ready to open your wallet.\n\nFord’s popular Fusion midsize sedan received a big makeover for 2013, adopting styling directly influenced by Aston Martin coupes. It’s a rare flash of hot and sassy style in a sea of gray and boring midsize sedans, the rest of which are designed to be inoffensive and conservative. America seems to prefer consistency over uniqueness in everything from hamburgers to family sedans.\n\nSwitching to a global chassis for that redesign made the Fusion a completely different car, so it hasn’t been updated all that much for the 2015 model year (compare 2014 and 2015 models here). But that’s OK, as the 2015 Fusion is still one of the newest, freshest entries on the market. But is it good enough to wrest sales from the perennially popular Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima?\n\nExterior & Styling\nFew people would disagree: The Ford Fusion is a very attractive car. Admittedly, higher-spec trim levels with bigger wheels and more chrome tend to look better, but even lower trims like my SE test vehicle — with its squinty headlights, big grille and shapely body — look good compared with the painfully generic Camry, Altima and Accord. It’s long and low, and while that looks great for styling purposes, it does require something of a compromise on interior headroom and outward visibility. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard on the Ford Fusion SE, as is a bright exhaust tip, but there isn’t much additional flash on this midlevel trim. It’s a good thing the styling doesn’t really require any.\n\nHow It Drives\nOut on the road, the Fusion’s European influence really shines through. This is a car meant to appeal to buyers around the world, and in other nations buyers tend to like their cars tighter, sportier and with better feedback than most American-style vehicles. As such, the Fusion is quick, with handling that’s responsive and decidedly sportier than most cars in its class.\n\nDespite that firm handling, though, the Fusion’s ride doesn’t suffer. It’s still well-damped over bumps and broken pavement, revealing a sophistication that’s lacking from a lot of vehicles that cost more than the Fusion. During our 2015 $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, many editors were surprised at the Fusion’s athleticism and found themselves driving faster than they thought they were, thanks to the car’s confidence-inspiring chassis, steering and strong brakes.\n\nFrom a powertrain standpoint, there was less consensus on the Ford’s abilities. Standard in the Fusion SE is a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but my test car had the optional 181-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine. If you require more power, a 231-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder is available. If maximum fuel economy is more your thing, a 141-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is available in a gas-electric hybrid model.\n\nOpinions of the 1.5-liter EcoBoost’s performance differed. I and several other editors found it perfectly adequate to the task of getting the Fusion around with a modicum of speed, providing brisk acceleration, no noticeable turbo lag and decent fuel economy. But a few colleagues disagreed, finding it pokey and inadequate compared with similarly powerful engines in the much lighter Camry, Accord and Altima. (Most competitors, it seems, are lighter than the Fusion; in our big comparison test, only the Chrysler 200 and Subaru Legacy outweighed it.)\n\nThe reason for putting such a small engine in a hefty car like the Fusion is to boost fuel economy without sacrificing performance, but we’re not entirely certain that was accomplished. It costs an extra $795 — not much for an engine upgrade – and the 1.5-liter EcoBoost motor provides an EPA-rated 24/36/28 mpg city/highway/combined, a figure we were able to duplicate in a mileage test. Opt for the version with stop-start technology, and those numbers all go up by 1 mpg, to 25/37/29 mpg.\n\nThe base 2.5-liter engine, however, is rated 22/34/26 mpg, which is on the low end versus competitors. The base Camry gets a 25/35/28 mpg rating, while the Accord’s 27/36/31 mpg and the Altima’s 27/38/31 blow the Fusion away. Part of the advantage the Accord and Altima have are their standard continuously variable automatic transmissions, which are inherently more fuel-efficient than the six-speed automatic that comes standard in the Fusion. If fuel economy is what you want, the Fusion Hybrid is rated 44/41/42 mpg, but even that falls short of the Honda Accord Hybrid’s 50/45/47 mpg rating. The Fusion can also be had as a plug-in hybrid model that’s able to go a short distance on electric power alone; the Accord offers a similar model. A hybrid Camry is also available, but the Altima can’t be had in hybrid form.\n\nInterior\nThe Ford Fusion’s daring design carries over to the interior, in which an attractive futuristic landscape is rendered in some unfortunately substandard plastics and fabrics. Higher-spec Fusions have wood trim, genuinely attractive patterned leather seats, neat color and lighting options, and impressive high-end electronics. Low-end Fusions, like the SE I drove, have the lesser version of Ford’s Sync multimedia system, plus ugly, shapeless fabric seats and a primitive feel that doesn’t match the quality appointments of a similarly priced Accord or Altima. The front seats’ bottom cushions feel short, and the fabric and stitching pattern look and feel laughably cheap.\n\nFront seat room is acceptable, if a bit narrow due to an unusually wide center console. Backseat room is tight in the leg and headroom departments — the price one pays for the Ford Fusion’s slippery styling. That styling also impedes outward visibility, with thick windshield pillars obscuring the view forward and creating bigger than normal blind spots. Overall, the consensus among our editors was that the Ford Fusion’s good looks outside aren’t matched by its interior appointments, and it’s definitely outclassed by competitors like the Accord and Altima – though not the Camry, which features similarly cheap-feeling interiors in its lower trim models.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe user-friendliness of the base multimedia system is terrible, with an astonishingly tiny display screen set low in the console, plus layers of buttons and confusing menus. Not only that, but if you have a lot of songs on your personal media device (as I do), as soon as you plug it in a voice will tell you that due to the number of songs, Sync’s voice commands will not be available — effectively negating one of the chief benefits that system is supposed to bring to the party. Given how cheap electronic memory is these days, this seems highly unusual – and it’s something that didn’t happen in any other car in our Midsize Sedan Challenge. The Fusion’s multimedia system is outclassed by just about every other competitor, and is truly embarrassed by the Chrysler 200’s Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen.\n\nThe only saving grace of the Ford Fusion’s controls is that none of them are the touch-sensitive, blank-panel type that come on higher trim levels. In the SE, you get dedicated buttons that are big, if a little strangely arranged on the console. The rest of the Fusion’s controls are well-done. Clear, easy-to-read gauges flank a small display screen, and the chunky steering wheel features two five-way selectors.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn-cabin storage is adequate, but not as functional as some competitors despite what seems to be plenty of real estate in the wide center console. Trunk room is better than most, featuring 16.0 cubic feet of space — more than the Camry (15.4 cubic feet), Accord (15.8 cubic feet) or Altima (15.4 cubic feet). You can thank the high tail’s styling, which enables a deep and tall trunk to stash luggage or gear. The backseat features a 60/40-split folding bench to accommodate longer items. Most midsize sedans feature such a backseat, with the notable exception of the Honda Accord.\n\nSafety\nThe Fusion earned mixed results in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, varying from three-star ratings in a couple of side-impact tests to five stars in most tests, including overall crash-test rating. See results of the tests here.\n\nThe Fusion has an interesting feature unique to Ford: optional inflatable rear seat belts. The rear shoulder belts contain special low-powered airbags that inflate to create a larger surface area, which better protects children from injury in a crash by spreading out the force of impact over a larger area, lessening the severity of the jolt.\n\nThe Fusion’s list of electronic safety aids is an impressive one, including adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, cross-traffic alert, even automatic parallel and perpendicular parking – but nearly all of it is optional, aside from a standard backup camera. See the list of what comes standard on the Fusion here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Ford Fusion starts as a base S trim for $23,225 including destination fee, which gets you things like the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, an automatic transmission, air conditioning, one-touch up and down windows front and rear, cruise control, a full complement of airbags, Ford’s basic Sync multimedia system and a few other niceties. Step up to the SE, for $24,760, and you’ll get things like 17-inch wheels, a standard power driver and passenger seat, and the ability to add optional leather seats and adaptive cruise control. Opting for the SE all-wheel-drive adds $3,795 to the price as well as a bit more content, including the most powerful engine – the 2.0-liter EcoBoost — 18-inch wheels and more. The top-of-the-line Ford Fusion is the Titanium trim, which has leather seats, available 19-inch wheels, a 12-speaker Sony audio system and more, for a starting price of $31,425. Option a non-hybrid Fusion up completely, and you’re looking at a loaded Titanium all-wheel drive model that costs more than $40,000. The most expensive Ford Fusion you can buy, however, is the Energi plug-in hybrid. Option that one to the max, and you’ll push north of $44,000.\n\nThere are nearly a dozen possible competitors to the Ford Fusion, and the competition is fierce. The Fusion routinely places just behind the top three finishers in the segment in sales every month. Tops is the Camry, which was just redesigned for 2015. Like the Fusion, base Camrys are not as pleasant to be in as higher-trim models, but unlike the Fusion the Camry can be had with a powerful V-6 engine. The Camry feels larger inside, but doesn’t offer all-wheel drive. Pricing is similar, but the Fusion can be optioned up to more advanced levels of technology, with extras like automatic parking and rain-sensing wipers available on lower trims.\n\nThe Accord is an older design but features great benefits like a spacious cabin, much better interior materials than the Fusion, Honda’s novel LaneWatch blind spot monitor and an optional V-6. It suffers from a backseat that folds only as a single bench, plus a split-level multimedia system that isn’t much easier to operate than the Fusion’s base system. The Altima is another good option, also featuring an interior that some say feels more spacious and comfortable than the Ford Fusion’s, better fuel economy (thanks to its standard CVT) and an optional V-6. But its interior comfort is a matter of debate, with some drivers not enjoying the Altima’s seats at all. See how these four competitors match up here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2014 about the 2015 Ford Fusion. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model.

That styling also impedes outward visibility, with thick windshield pillars obscuring the view forward and creating bigger than normal blind spots. Overall, the consensus among our editors was that the Fusion’s good looks outside aren’t matched by its interior appointments, and it’s definitely outclassed by competitors like the Accord and Altima – though not the Camry, which features similarly cheap-feeling interiors in its lower trim models.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe user-friendliness of the base multimedia system is terrible, with an astonishingly tiny display screen set low in the console, plus layers of buttons and confusing menus. Not only that, but if you have a lot of songs on your personal media device (as I do), as soon as you plug it in a voice will tell you that due to the number of songs, Sync’s voice commands will not be available — effectively negating one of the chief benefits that system is supposed to bring to the party. Given how cheap electronic memory is these days, this seems highly unusual – and it’s something that didn’t happen in any other car in our Midsize Sedan Challenge. The Fusion’s multimedia system is outclassed by just about every other competitor, and is truly embarrassed by the Chrysler 200’s Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen.\n\nThe only saving grace of the Fusion’s controls is that none of them are the touch-sensitive, blank-panel type that come on higher trim levels. In the SE, you get dedicated buttons that are big, if a little strangely arranged on the console. The rest of the Fusion’s controls are well-done. Clear, easy-to-read gauges flank a small display screen, and the chunky steering wheel features two five-way selectors.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn-cabin storage is adequate, but not as functional as some competitors despite what seems to be plenty of real estate in the wide center console. Trunk room is better than most, featuring 16.0 cubic feet of space — more than the Camry (15.4 cubic feet), Accord (15.8 cubic feet) or Altima (15.4 cubic feet). You can thank the high tail’s styling, which enables a deep and tall trunk to stash luggage or gear. The backseat features a 60/40-split folding bench to accommodate longer items. Most midsize sedans feature such a backseat, with the notable exception of the Honda Accord.\n\nSafety\nThe Fusion earned mixed results in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, varying from three-star ratings in a couple of side-impact tests to five stars in most tests, including overall crash-test rating. See results of the tests here.\n\nThe Fusion has an interesting feature unique to Ford: optional inflatable rear seat belts. The rear shoulder belts contain special low-powered airbags that inflate to create a larger surface area, which better protects children from injury in a crash by spreading out the force of impact over a larger area, lessening the severity of the jolt.\n\nThe Fusion’s list of electronic safety aids is an impressive one, including adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, cross-traffic alert, even automatic parallel and perpendicular parking – but nearly all of it is optional, aside from a standard backup camera. See the list of what comes standard on the Fusion here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Fusion starts as a base S trim for $23,225 including destination fee, which gets you things like the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, an automatic transmission, air conditioning, one-touch up and down windows front and rear, cruise control, a full complement of airbags, Ford’s basic Sync multimedia system and a few other niceties. Step up to the SE, for $24,760, and you’ll get things like 17-inch wheels, a standard power driver and passenger seat, and the ability to add optional leather seats and adaptive cruise control. Opting for the SE all-wheel-drive adds $3,795 to the price as well as a bit more content, including the most powerful engine – the 2.0-liter EcoBoost — 18-inch wheels and more. The top-of-the-line Fusion is the Titanium trim, which has leather seats, available 19-inch wheels, a 12-speaker Sony audio system and more, for a starting price of $31,425. Option a non-hybrid Fusion up completely, and you’re looking at a loaded Titanium all-wheel drive model that costs more than $40,000. The most expensive Fusion you can buy, however, is the Energi plug-in hybrid. Option that one to the max, and you’ll push north of $44,000. Configure a Fusion your way here.\n\nThere are nearly a dozen possible competitors to the Ford Fusion, and the competition is fierce. The Fusion routinely places just behind the top three finishers in the segment in sales every month. Tops is the Camry, which was just redesigned for 2015. Like the Fusion, base Camrys are not as pleasant to be in as higher-trim models, but unlike the Fusion the Camry can be had with a powerful V-6 engine. The Camry feels larger inside, but doesn’t offer all-wheel drive. Pricing is similar, but the Fusion can be optioned up to more advanced levels of technology, with extras like automatic parking and rain-sensing wipers available on lower trims.\n\nThe Accord is an older design but features great benefits like a spacious cabin, much better interior materials than the Fusion, Honda’s novel LaneWatch blind spot monitor and an optional V-6. It suffers from a backseat that folds only as a single bench, plus a split-level multimedia system that isn’t much easier to operate than the Fusion’s base system. The Altima is another good option, also featuring an interior that some say feels more spacious and comfortable than the Fusion’s, better fuel economy (thanks to its standard CVT) and an optional V-6. But its interior comfort is a matter of debate, with some drivers not enjoying the Altima’s seats at all. See how these four competitors match up here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Ford Fusion?\n\nThe Ford Fusion is a mid-size sedan that seats up to five people. A 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, but a selection of turbocharged four-cylinder engines is available. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid (Energi) variants are also offered. All engines pair with a six-speed automatic transmission, except for the hybrid versions, which have a continuously variable automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Competitors include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Ford Fusion?\n\nThe FordPass Connect telematics system is now standard.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Ford Fusion Are Most Important?\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nAvailable features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, power-adjustable front seats, leather-trimmed seats, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a power moonroof, an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, navigation, a Sony premium stereo and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Ford Fusion?\n\nThe Fusion remains a good-driving mid-size sedan with noteworthy ride and handling. The available Sync 3 touchscreen multimedia system is easy to use, but the car’s backseat feels cramped and thick pillars limit forward visibility. The Fusion was last redesigned for the 2013 model year, and Ford says this is the last generation of the sedan. Going forward, the automaker is turning the bulk of its attention to SUVs and trucks.",

      "expert_review": "Ford has redesigned its midsize Fusion sedan for 2010, and has added a gasoline-hybrid model to the lineup as well.\n\nPrices range from $19,620-$28,030 (plus $725 freight) for the gasoline-only models, while the hybrid version begins at $27,625 – and sports fuel economy better than that of the competing Toyota Camry hybrid.\n\nThe new Fusion officially went on sale in March, and was among the best sellers in the government’s recent Cash for Clunkers program.\n\nAlthough not a complete makeover – the car still rides on the chassis it came with when first introduced for 2006 – the new Fusion got numerous exterior changes and interior upgrades, along with a lot of new technology.\n\nIt’s quite a bit more stylish than before, and has a lot more standard content – making it seem more like a luxury car than a mass-market model.\n\nSimilar changes were made to the corresponding Mercury Milan model, including the addition of a hybrid version. Base prices of the gasoline-only Milan models range from $21,535-$28,155 (plus $725 freight), while the hybrid starts at $27,855.\n\nThe Fusion and Milan hybrids are rated at 41 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway, which beats the Toyota Camry hybrid by 8 mpg in the city and 2 mpg on the highway.\n\nA combination of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and electric motor powers the hybrids, while gasoline-only Fusion and Milan models offer a choice of a four-cylinder or two V-6 engines.\n\nThe best gasoline-only fuel economy comes with the four-cylinder Fusion S, which is EPA rated at 34 mpg on the highway and 23 in the city. That beats both the gasoline-powered Camry and Honda Accord models. Those, with automatic transmissions, are EPA rated at 21 city/30 highway for the Accord and 21/31 for the Camry.\n\nFord’s only hybrids until now have been the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner compact crossover utility vehicles, which entered their second generation last year.\n\nHybrid Fusion and Milan models come with a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine using the so-called Atkinson cycle design for better fuel economy. It’s assisted by an electric motor, and power is transferred to the wheels by an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission.\n\nThe hybrid’s gasoline engine is rated at 155 horsepower and 136 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nIt’s the same two-mode hybrid drive system that Ford uses in the Escape and Mariner models, both of which were upgraded significantly for 2009. Ford developed the system on its own, but licensed some of the technology from Toyota because of similarities with Toyota’s hybrids.\n\nFord said its hybrid team developed a system “that combines the best attributes of the gasoline engine and electric battery-driven motors to deliver the optimal experience for the customer in terms of driving performance and fuel economy.”\n\nThe system will allow the Fusion and Milan to operate longer at higher speeds – up to 47 mpg — in pure electric mode, Ford said. The Toyota Prius, for example, automatically shifts to gasoline power at about 25 mph maximum.\n\nWith their city EPA ratings, the Fusion and Milan hybrids could go more than 700 miles between re-fueling, Ford said. A smaller, lighter nickel-metal hydride battery has been developed for the hybrids, and can produce 20 percent more power over the previous generation of this battery.\n\n“Because our hybrid can run at a much higher speed in electric mode, you can do so much more in city-driving situations,” said Gil Portalatin, Ford’s hybrid applications manager. “Under the right conditions, you can drive in your neighborhood or mall parking lots without using a drop of gasoline.”\n\nIncluded on both models is Ford’s “SmartGauge with EcoGuide,” which the automaker explains is a “unique instrument cluster … that helps coach [drivers] on how to optimize performance of their hybrid.”\n\nIt displays instant fuel economy, fuel economy history, odometer, engine coolant temperature, what gear the car is in and trip data.\n\nAmong special features on the hybrids are unique badges on both sides and the rear of the vehicle; 17-inch, eight-spoke wheels; recycled seat fabric; and a standard 110-volt power outlet.\n\nFusion gasoline models come in four trim levels – the base S, the SE, the fancier SEL, and the Sport, which comes only with a 3.5-liter, 263-horsepower V-6 engine.\n\nFor this report, we tested the regular gasoline Fusion SEL front-wheel-drive model, with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine different from the one in the hybrid. This engine is rated at 175 horsepower and 172 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nOur tester, with the six-speed automatic transmission, had EPA mileage estimates of 22 city/31 highway. A six-speed manual gearbox is offered, but only with the four-cylinder engine and in the S and SE models.\n\nAll-wheel drive is available in the Fusion SEL, but only with the optional 3.0-liter V-6 engine, rated at 240 horsepower and 228 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nOur SEL model was quite well equipped for its base $23,975 price, with such standard amenities as leather seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel with integrated cruise and audio controls, dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power driver’s seat with lumbar adjustment, the SYNC voice-activated audio system that allows for playback of iPods with simple voice commands, and Sirius satellite radio.\n\nA tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel was standard, along with power windows/mirrors/door locks and that great Ford driver’s door keypad that lets you in with a code if you happen to lock your keys inside.\n\nOther standard features included 17-inch aluminum wheels, automatic headlights, a custom grille, chrome dual exhaust tips, heated outside mirrors, fog lights, and Ford’s new cap-less fuel tank.\n\nThe roomy trunk – 16.5 cubic feet – has a pass-through to the passenger compartment for larger cargo, accommodated by the 60/40 split-folding rear bench seat.\n\nSafety features include front seat-mounted side air bags; electronic stability control with traction control, roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for both rows; a tire-pressure monitoring system; four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes; a perimeter alarm; and an SOS post-crash alert system.\n\nThe car seats five, although four fit most comfortably. The front bucket seats in our tester weren’t the most comfortable I’ve experienced; the bottom cushion wasn’t long enough to support my thighs sufficiently. But the seats probably would be fine for most adults.\n\nCup holders are well placed, and there are bottle holders in the front doors – although they’re rather small and not easy to use. Otherwise, the interior was very well laid out, and I really liked the large, easy-to-read instruments with their cool blue lighting.\n\nThe test vehicle’s four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission gave me all the power I needed for my daily commute, which includes city streets, country roads, and a 20-mile Interstate highway segment in between.\n\nOne of the V-6 engines might be more fun to have because of the extra zip they offer, but I’d prefer the better fuel economy of the four-cylinder.\n\nOur tested came with some of the new technology, all in a $2,740 package (minus a $945 discount).\n\nIt included blind-spot warning lights in both of the outside mirrors, which illuminate an orange dot when there is a vehicle in the adjacent lane on either side. Also in the package were a rearview camera system, power moon roof, and a Sony 12-speaker sound system.\n\nTotal price with freight and options was $26,495, but with all the luxury amenities, the car seemed as though it should cost about $10,000 more. It certainly came across as a great value compared with some of its peers.\n\nThat should help Ford with its goal of taking some market share from both the Toyota Camry, which is the top-selling car in the United States, and the Honda Accord, a perennial favorite among midsize-sedan buyers.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\nThe package: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder, V-6 or hybrid-powered, front- or all-wheel drive family sedan.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2009 about the 2010 Ford Fusion. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nWhen it debuted in 2005, the Ford Fusion had the heavy task of replacing the once-dominating Taurus. It certainly found its niche in the segment, even if it fell short compared to competition from Honda and Toyota. The second-generation Fusion arrives this spring and, thanks to a number of significant changes and a few cosmetic ones, the 2010 version will be a major competitor in the midsize segment.\n\nForget the bold new grille — which is even bigger and shinier than last year’s — or the upgraded interior; what really sets the 2010 Fusion apart is its smoother ride, wonderful new four-cylinder engine and a number of standard features that make it a good deal as well.\n\nWhat’s Changed\nThe most noticeable change is the Fusion’s exterior design. The original Fusion debuted the three-blade grille that has quickly become the new face of Ford products. Now, that chromed look gets a shot of steroids; the grille is taller and narrower, with a pronounced downward angle coming from the slanted headlights. Where the old Fusion had a much more horizontal appearance, the new Fusion seems a bit angrier. It’s definitely a cutting-edge look.\n\nThe hood has a noticeable dome on it. In sports cars, that’s often referred to as a “power dome” because the extra space is needed to shoehorn large engines under the hood. The Fusion clearly doesn’t need the space, but the look gives it a powerful air. Even the SE trim I tested had jewel-like headlights and fog lights. In back, the taillights have been beefed up, now featuring a honeycomb-type effect that kind of mimics what LED taillights look like, but without the cost of LEDs. It’s a smart move.\n\nInside, the Fusion is so subtly different that a lot of people might think nothing has been changed. I drove the old and new models back-to-back over 600 miles of total driving, however, and can attest that they are worlds apart. The materials that make up the doors and dashboard are still the same shape, but the top of the dashboard has a new finish to it that makes the 2010 model feel not quite as cheap as the previous generation.\n\nThe bigger changes are to the seats, which are much more comfortable now, especially for long trips. They offer more support and the cloth is high-quality and looks like it’ll hold up well over time. The SE model has all power adjustments except for lumbar support, which can be adjusted using a knob.\n\nFord also slickly revamped the gauge cluster: In place of the old plain-white numerals on a black background is a blue-and-white background with space-age-like numerals. It’s nearly identical to what Honda uses in the Civic, it probably cost the company very little to change and it makes a world of difference in appearance.\n\nThe center stack of controls is the other major change. The display has been raised to the top of the stack to keep your eyes closer to the road. Substantial knobs are used to control the volume, tuning, air-conditioning temperature and vent speed.\n\nPerformance\nUndeniably the most impressive aspect of the 2010 Fusion in the week I spent with it was its new four-cylinder engine. The 2.5-liter produces 175 horsepower, which makes it one of the most powerful fours on the market. That power translates to a real-world driving experience that is surprisingly sporty. It doesn’t feel like there’s a V-6 under the hood, but neither is there any desire for a V-6. The four-cylinder accelerates robustly during passing maneuvers on the highway, and it’s the same when merging on highway ramps. Cruising at 70 mph is a breeze, and the engine never seems to struggle.\n\nThe 175-hp engine is a 15-hp improvement over the outgoing entry-level Fusion, but mileage has increased as well; it’s now rated at 23/34 mpg city/highway. Unfortunately, most of my testing was done in temperatures well below 20 degrees and at mostly 70 mph. On a drive from Detroit to Chicago in these conditions, I averaged 29 mpg. The 34 mpg highway rating is the highest in the segment, besting the Toyota Camry, Chevy Malibu and Honda Accord.\n\nThere are two V-6 options. The Fusion SE and SEL feature a 240-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, and the Fusion Sport has a 263-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Mileage numbers have not yet been released for the V-6 engines. All-wheel drive will also be an option with both V-6 power plants.\n\nI’ve tested those engines in other Ford products, and they’ve proved competent but not overly memorable from a performance standpoint.\n\nMy test car was equipped with a six-speed manual transmission that replaces the five-speed manual in the previous model. A six-speed automatic is available with the four-cylinder and standard with the V-6. The manual was relatively smooth, if a tad boring. If you’re into sporty driving, this is not for you. If you’re into thrifty driving or have a long commute, it’s probably preferable to a heavy clutch and tricky shift gates.\n\nThird gear was where I found myself most, in its sweet spot of acceleration and around-town speeds.\n\nSteering wasn’t as heavy as the 2008 Fusion I tested the week before I had the 2010. (The 2009 model year was a short one for the Fusion, with no noticeable changes from the 2008 version, so Ford kept 2008s in its test fleet.) The new Fusion has a much lighter feel all-around, which is a blessing for navigating parking garages. I found the center point a bit light on the highway; there was just a bit too much play in the wheel. But I still preferred the overall steering feel to the old model.\n\nRide quality is also significantly improved in the new Fusion. It’s worlds more comfortable now, with a ride that rivals the new Chevy Malibu without feeling as disconnected as the Toyota Camry. It’s a nice tradeoff. I also found the 2010 very quiet. It isolated road and wind noise remarkably well, especially as I drove through a horrible winter storm with 35 mph wind gusts.\n\nThis segment is crowded with very good cars. I’ve tested them all, and the new Fusion ranks high on my list for its four-cylinder performance, which I think rivals — if not bests — the rest, mainly because it never seems like there’s a lack of power. It may not feel anything like a V-6, but it has none of the typical four-cylinder tradeoffs, like weak passing power. Steering may be an issue for those who like heavier setups, like those found in the older Fusion, the Mazda6 or the Honda Accord.\n\nA Fusion Hybrid is scheduled to go on sale this year with a very healthy mileage rating of 41/36 mpg city/highway. This makes it more efficient than Toyota’s Camry Hybrid but less efficient than the Toyota Prius. However, the Fusion Hybrid offers an alternative both to the Prius’ hatchback body style and to its design, which some find off-putting.\n\nFeatures\nThe Fusion comes decently equipped at its starting price of $19,270 for the base S model. It comes standard with cruise control, 16-inch aluminum wheels, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer, a CD stereo with four speakers, stability control, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nMove up to the SE at $20,545, and you get 17-inch steel wheels with painted covers that look remarkably like aluminum wheels, dual exhaust, fog lamps, body-colored side mirrors, a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, Sirius Satellite Radio and six stereo speakers.\n\nSEL models start at $23,975 and add ambient lighting, Sync, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a six-way power-adjustable passenger seat, leather seats, heated front seats, a keyless entry keypad, a six-speed automatic transmission and 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 is available on the SE and SEL.\n\nThe Fusion Sport gets the 3.5-liter V-6 standard, as well as a sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch aluminum wheels, chrome exterior accents, a spoiler and unique bodywork. It also comes standard with Sync, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and upgraded leather seats.\n\nOther available options and packages can be added to lower trim levels, including Ford’s superb Sync system, which cost just $395 in the past. Pricing hasn’t been announced for 2010. Sync allows drivers to plug in an iPod or another MP3 player and control the player via spoken prompts. Just say, “play artist Bruce Springsteen,” and every Boss track on your iPhone will be queued up.\n\nThe optional navigation system has been upgraded with new Sync features as well, including live traffic, weather, sports scores and even local movie listings. All can be controlled by voice commands or via the touch-screen interface. I haven’t tried the system out in a Fusion yet, but it’s similar to the one in the Lincoln MKS, which was exceptionally easy to use and had a crisp, clear screen. The Fusion’s screen, however, is larger than the Lincoln’s, at a gigantic 8 inches.\n\nNavigation commands can be controlled by voice, too. The optional nav system comes with an upgraded Sony stereo that has a 10GB hard drive and 12 speakers.\n\nThe trunk is also quite big, at 16.5 cubic feet. That’s bigger than the Accord’s 14, Camry’s 14.5 and the Malibu’s 15.1 cubic feet. The Mazda6 is slightly bigger, at 16.6 cubic feet. You can lower the Fusion’s rear seats via latches mounted near the trunklid, so there’s no need to go into the backseat.\n\nAll measures of legroom, headroom, hip room and shoulder room are on par with the rest of the segment, but the backseat feels larger in both the Accord and Mazda6.\n\nSafety\nA full complement of airbags is standard in the Fusion, including side-mounted airbags for the front-seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. The big improvement on the safety front versus the old Fusion is the inclusion of electronic stability control standard on even the base model. The system, along with standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, adds a tremendous amount of control to the vehicle and could help it earn Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which requires a stability system to earn that distinction. That also requires top crash-test ratings, though, and the 2010 Fusion has not yet been crash-tested by either the federal government or IIHS.\n\nA blind spot detection system is also available as an option. It alerts drivers when a car is in their blind spot so they don’t change lanes at the wrong time. Ford’s system uses sensors that can also detect an approaching car when you’re backing out of a parking space. This is a fairly new technology that I have yet to test, but it shows real-world utility.\n\nFusion in the Market\nFord has completed a very successful update of the Fusion for 2010. It’s priced competitively and comes relatively well-equipped, even in its most base form. Factor in the excellent mileage and terrific driving experience, and the four-cylinder model really shines in today’s midsize sedan market.\n\nEven the new design stands out in a crowd. I don’t really like to proclaim a car a winner or a loser, but it’s hard to argue with all the improvements Ford has made to the Fusion.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2009 about the 2010 Ford Fusion. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhen it debuted in 2005, the Ford Fusion had the heavy task of replacing the once-dominating Taurus. It certainly found its niche in the segment, even if it fell short compared to competition from Honda and Toyota. The second-generation Fusion arrives this spring and, thanks to a number of significant changes and a few cosmetic ones, the 2010 version will be a major competitor in the midsize segment.\n\nForget the bold new grille — which is even bigger and shinier than last year’s — or the upgraded interior; what really sets the 2010 Fusion apart is its smoother ride, wonderful new four-cylinder engine and a number of standard features that make it a good deal as well.\n\nWhat’s Changed\nThe most noticeable change is the Fusion’s exterior design. The original Fusion debuted the three-blade grille that has quickly become the new face of Ford products. Now, that chromed look gets a shot of steroids; the grille is taller and narrower, with a pronounced downward angle coming from the slanted headlights. Where the old Fusion had a much more horizontal appearance, the new Fusion seems a bit angrier. It’s definitely a cutting-edge look.\n\nThe hood has a noticeable dome on it. In sports cars, that’s often referred to as a “power dome” because the extra space is needed to shoehorn large engines under the hood. The Fusion clearly doesn’t need the space, but the look gives it a powerful air. Even the SE trim I tested had jewel-like headlights and fog lights. In back, the taillights have been beefed up, now featuring a honeycomb-type effect that kind of mimics what LED taillights look like, but without the cost of LEDs. It’s a smart move.\n\nInside, the Fusion is so subtly different that a lot of people might think nothing has been changed. I drove the old and new models back-to-back over 600 miles of total driving, however, and can attest that they are worlds apart. The materials that make up the doors and dashboard are still the same shape, but the top of the dashboard has a new finish to it that makes the 2010 model feel not quite as cheap as the previous generation.\n\nThe bigger changes are to the seats, which are much more comfortable now, especially for long trips. They offer more support and the cloth is high-quality and looks like it’ll hold up well over time. The SE model has all power adjustments except for lumbar support, which can be adjusted using a knob.\n\nFord also slickly revamped the gauge cluster: In place of the old plain-white numerals on a black background is a blue-and-white background with space-age-like numerals. It’s nearly identical to what Honda uses in the Civic, it probably cost the company very little to change and it makes a world of difference in appearance.\n\nThe center stack of controls is the other major change. The display has been raised to the top of the stack to keep your eyes closer to the road. Substantial knobs are used to control the volume, tuning, air-conditioning temperature and vent speed.\n\nPerformance\nUndeniably the most impressive aspect of the 2010 Fusion in the week I spent with it was its new four-cylinder engine. The 2.5-liter produces 175 horsepower, which makes it one of the most powerful fours on the market. That power translates to a real-world driving experience that is surprisingly sporty. It doesn’t feel like there’s a V-6 under the hood, but neither is there any desire for a V-6. The four-cylinder accelerates robustly during passing maneuvers on the highway, and it’s the same when merging on highway ramps. Cruising at 70 mph is a breeze, and the engine never seems to struggle.\n\nThe 175-hp engine is a 15-hp improvement over the outgoing entry-level Fusion, but mileage has increased as well; it’s now rated at 23/34 mpg city/highway. Unfortunately, most of my testing was done in temperatures well below 20 degrees and at mostly 70 mph. On a drive from Detroit to Chicago in these conditions, I averaged 29 mpg. The 34 mpg highway rating is the highest in the segment, besting the Toyota Camry, Chevy Malibu and Honda Accord.\n\nThere are two V-6 options. The Fusion SE and SEL feature a 240-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, and the Fusion Sport has a 263-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Mileage numbers have not yet been released for the V-6 engines. All-wheel drive will also be an option with both V-6 power plants.\n\nI’ve tested those engines in other Ford products, and they’ve proved competent but not overly memorable from a performance standpoint.\n\nMy test car was equipped with a six-speed manual transmission that replaces the five-speed manual in the previous model. A six-speed automatic is available with the four-cylinder and standard with the V-6. The manual was relatively smooth, if a tad boring. If you’re into sporty driving, this is not for you. If you’re into thrifty driving or have a long commute, it’s probably preferable to a heavy clutch and tricky shift gates.\n\nThird gear was where I found myself most, in its sweet spot of acceleration and around-town speeds.\n\nSteering wasn’t as heavy as the 2008 Fusion I tested the week before I had the 2010. (The 2009 model year was a short one for the Fusion, with no noticeable changes from the 2008 version, so Ford kept 2008s in its test fleet.) The new Fusion has a much lighter feel all-around, which is a blessing for navigating parking garages. I found the center point a bit light on the highway; there was just a bit too much play in the wheel. But I still preferred the overall steering feel to the old model.\n\nRide quality is also significantly improved in the new Fusion. It’s worlds more comfortable now, with a ride that rivals the new Chevy Malibu without feeling as disconnected as the Toyota Camry. It’s a nice tradeoff. I also found the 2010 very quiet. It isolated road and wind noise remarkably well, especially as I drove through a horrible winter storm with 35 mph wind gusts.\n\nThis segment is crowded with very good cars. I’ve tested them all, and the new Fusion ranks high on my list for its four-cylinder performance, which I think rivals — if not bests — the rest, mainly because it never seems like there’s a lack of power. It may not feel anything like a V-6, but it has none of the typical four-cylinder tradeoffs, like weak passing power. Steering may be an issue for those who like heavier setups, like those found in the older Fusion, the Mazda6 or the Honda Accord.\n\nA Fusion Hybrid is scheduled to go on sale this year with a very healthy mileage rating of 41/36 mpg city/highway. This makes it more efficient than Toyota’s Camry Hybrid but less efficient than the Toyota Prius. However, the Fusion Hybrid offers an alternative both to the Prius’ hatchback body style and to its design, which some find off-putting.\n\nFeatures\nThe Fusion comes decently equipped at its starting price of $19,270 for the base S model. It comes standard with cruise control, 16-inch aluminum wheels, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a trip computer, a CD stereo with four speakers, stability control, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nMove up to the SE at $20,545, and you get 17-inch steel wheels with painted covers that look remarkably like aluminum wheels, dual exhaust, fog lamps, body-colored side mirrors, a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, Sirius Satellite Radio and six stereo speakers.\n\nSEL models start at $23,975 and add ambient lighting, Sync, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and a six-way power-adjustable passenger seat, leather seats, heated front seats, a keyless entry keypad, a six-speed automatic transmission and 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 is available on the SE and SEL.\n\nThe Fusion Sport gets the 3.5-liter V-6 standard, as well as a sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch aluminum wheels, chrome exterior accents, a spoiler and unique bodywork. It also comes standard with Sync, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and upgraded leather seats.\n\nOther available options and packages can be added to lower trim levels, including Ford’s superb Sync system, which cost just $395 in the past. Pricing hasn’t been announced for 2010. Sync allows drivers to plug in an iPod or another MP3 player and control the player via spoken prompts. Just say, “play artist Bruce Springsteen,” and every Boss track on your iPhone will be queued up.\n\nThe optional navigation system has been upgraded with new Sync features as well, including live traffic, weather, sports scores and even local movie listings. All can be controlled by voice commands or via the touch-screen interface. I haven’t tried the system out in a Fusion yet, but it’s similar to the one in the Lincoln MKS, which was exceptionally easy to use and had a crisp, clear screen. The Fusion’s screen, however, is larger than the Lincoln’s, at a gigantic 8 inches.\n\nNavigation commands can be controlled by voice, too. The optional nav system comes with an upgraded Sony stereo that has a 10GB hard drive and 12 speakers.\n\nThe trunk is also quite big, at 16.5 cubic feet. That’s bigger than the Accord’s 14, Camry’s 14.5 and the Malibu’s 15.1 cubic feet. The Mazda6 is slightly bigger, at 16.6 cubic feet. You can lower the Fusion’s rear seats via latches mounted near the trunklid, so there’s no need to go into the backseat.\n\nAll measures of legroom, headroom, hip room and shoulder room are on par with the rest of the segment, but the backseat feels larger in both the Accord and Mazda6.\n\nSafety\nA full complement of airbags is standard in the Fusion, including side-mounted airbags for the front-seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. The big improvement on the safety front versus the old Fusion is the inclusion of electronic stability control standard on even the base model. The system, along with standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, adds a tremendous amount of control to the vehicle and could help it earn Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which requires a stability system to earn that distinction. That also requires top crash-test ratings, though, and the 2010 Fusion has not yet been crash-tested by either the federal government or IIHS.\n\nA blind spot detection system is also available as an option. It alerts drivers when a car is in their blind spot so they don’t change lanes at the wrong time. Ford’s system uses sensors that can also detect an approaching car when you’re backing out of a parking space. This is a fairly new technology that I have yet to test, but it shows real-world utility.\n\nFusion in the Market\nFord has completed a very successful update of the Fusion for 2010. It’s priced competitively and comes relatively well-equipped, even in its most base form. Factor in the excellent mileage and terrific driving experience, and the four-cylinder model really shines in today’s midsize sedan market.\n\nEven the new design stands out in a crowd. I don’t really like to proclaim a car a winner or a loser, but it’s hard to argue with all the improvements Ford has made to the Fusion.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "As aggressive as Ford has been in trying to position the Fusion against the perennial class leaders — the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord — the company hasn’t been particularly vocal about one valuable card in the Fusion’s deck: It’s offered with all-wheel-drive, and the Camry and Accord are not.\n\nThat’s certainly a selling point in the snow belt, but it’s a pretty potent asset anywhere in the country that has rain, road construction, or idiot drivers who periodically pull out in front of you. That pretty much covers — everywhere.\n\nGranted, the advent of a whole bunch of technologies, from radial tires to electronic stability control, has made all-wheel-drive less of an advantage than it used to be. But on any sort of slippery surface, AWD retains an edge. How important that edge is, and how much you are willing to pay extra for it, is up to you.\n\nThe test Fusion, with all-wheel-drive and traction control, lists for a base price of $23,825. The same car with front-wheel-drive is about $1,800 less. Would I pay $1,800 extra to get AWD? In a split second.\n\nThe best thing about modern AWD is that it’s invisible. It doesn’t affect the ride, or the turning circle, or make more noise. It does add a little weight and complexity, but these systems are extremely reliable. The fact that the engine is powering the front and rear wheels typically trims fuel mileage a little, and that’s the case here: The AWD Fusion is EPA-rated at 19 mpg city, 26 mpg highway. With front-wheel-drive, 20/28.\n\nThose numbers are with the 3.0-liter, 221-horsepower V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission. The base Fusion has a 2.-3-liter, 160-horsepower four-cylinder, but the AWD feature is offered only with the V-6.\n\nEven the base Fusion S, with the four-cylinder and a five-speed manual transmission, has a ton of equipment for a base price of less than $18,000, including side and side-curtain airbags, air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry, power windows and a stereo. Next up is the SE, which adds an automatic transmission and several other features, and the SEL, which adds bigger tires and wheels and some additional equipment.\n\nThe test car’s base price of $23,825 rose to $28,525, thanks to antilock brakes ($595 — they ought to be standard on this model), Sirius satellite radio ($195), leather upholstery ($895), an easy-to-use navigation system ($1,895), and an upgraded stereo ($420). Shipping was $700.\n\nFord had a lot riding on the Fusion, and the car shows considerable attention to detail. Styling is handsome, interior and trunk room ample, and performance is more than acceptable in every area. The powertrain lacks the sophistication of the Honda or Toyota V-6 — this 3.0-liter engine is getting a little long in the tooth — and there was a little roughness under hard acceleration. While 221 horsepower isn’t bad at all, the V-6 is still giving up 55 horses to the Camry and the new 2008 Accord.\n\nInside, the Fusion’s instruments and controls give no cause for complaint, and the front bucket seats are fine. Rear seat room is a little tight for taller adults, but that’s true with the competition, too.\n\nHandling is very good — the ride is plenty smooth, but the Fusion AWD is as nimble as anything in this class and price range. Not surprising, as it’s based on the excellent Mazda6 platform.\n\nEvery Fusion model is a worthy competitor for others in its class, but the AWD version is in a class by itself. Nicely done.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2008 about the 2008 Ford Fusion. This year’s Fusion gains an optional electronic stability system, whose absence in 2008 put the car at a competitive safety disadvantage. To see what else is new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThree years have passed since the Ford Fusion arrived, and those years have been kind: Its proportions still lend a clean-cut athleticism that’s rare among family sedans, and its spot-on handling puts many of those sedans to shame. In competition with some of its freshest rivals, the Fusion comes up short overall, but it beats most of them in value — the well-equipped base model starts around $18,000 — and remains a viable choice for car shoppers seeking a midsize bargain.\n\nThe Fusion comes in S, SE and SEL trims, with front- or all-wheel drive, manual or automatic transmissions, and four-cylinder or V-6 engines; click here to see a side-by-side comparison with the 2007 model. Mercury markets a twin in the slightly pricier Milan. I tested a Fusion SEL with the four-cylinder and a stick shift, though I’ve driven the V-6 automatic, too.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nFord’s 160-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder is standard on all trims. It works with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Optional on the SE and SEL is a 221-hp, 3.0-liter V-6; it comes only with a six-speed automatic.\n\nThe four-cylinder feels smooth, revving to high speeds with none of the strained fussiness that often accompanies such moves. Passing power seems adequate, if not quite energetic, and I found enough pep to get around town with two passengers in tow. The drivetrain is quiet, too: With little engine noise to remind me to, I forgot to shift into fifth gear on the highway several times.\n\nThe gearshift itself has long throws, but each gear position feels crisp and well-defined. Parents should know that the Fusion is a good candidate for teaching teens to drive stick — its clutch is light and forgiving, and the accelerator isn’t overly sensitive.\n\nThe V-6 feels comparatively less impressive. It’s certainly stronger than the four-cylinder, and it moves quickest when revved hard, but it just can’t muster the forcefulness of a V-6 Nissan Altima or Toyota Camry, both of which have another half-liter of displacement at their disposal. Stick with front-wheel drive for the best acceleration; the all-wheel-drive system saddles the Fusion with an extra 218 pounds, or roughly 6 percent more weight.\n\nAnother disappointment is the Fusion’s gas mileage: Among its major competitors, it’s the only car that can’t manage 30 mpg on the highway. You’d think the Fusion’s smaller engines would turn out better efficiency, but modern automotive technology proves that isn’t always the case:\n\nMileage Compared (city/highway, mpg)\n \tFour-cylinder\tV-6\nNissan Altima\t23/32 (manual); 23/31 (auto)\t19/27 (manual)*; 19/26 (auto)*\nHonda Accord\t22/31 (manual); 21/31 (auto)\t19/29 (auto)\nToyota Camry\t21/31 (manual and auto)\t19/28 (auto)\nHyundai Sonata\t21/31 (manual); 21/30 (auto)\t19/28 (auto)\nChevrolet Malibu\t22/30 (auto)\t18/29 (3.5L auto); 17/26 (3.6L auto)\nFord Fusion\t20/29 (manual); 20/28 (auto)\t18/26 (auto, FWD); 17/25 (auto, AWD)\nSource: EPA for 2008 models.\n*Premium fuel recommended; all others recommend regular.\n\nAll Fusions have four-wheel-disc brakes, and antilock brakes are newly standard for 2008. The pedal produces linear response, though it doesn’t inspire as much stopping confidence as the brakes in the new Chevy Malibu.\n\nRide & Handling\nAll Fusions have a four-wheel-independent suspension, and my test car came with a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels. The resulting ride is more supple than the car’s thin P225/45R18 tires would suggest, but the suspension can become quite loud over major bumps. There’s plenty of road noise on the highway, too, though wind noise remains in check. Presumably the regular suspension and 16- or 17-inch wheels — which come with chunkier 60- or 50-series tires, respectively — provide a more cushioned ride.\n\nHandling is probably the Fusion’s best attribute. Its steering wheel turns with a light touch but stops short of feeling overly assisted, and the precise turn-in will impress anyone used to driving a family car. The chassis shows firm composure over stretches of broken pavement, only yielding to wobbly shake-ups after serious bumps. On highway cloverleaves, body roll remains controlled.\n\nUnfortunately, the steering doesn’t yield a tight turning circle: At 39 feet, it’s more than a foot wider than a number of major competitors.\n\nExterior & Styling\nA car’s proportions are usually the first thing to go sour — note the redesigned Camry, mildly provocative in late 2006 and all but stale a year later. Improbably, the Fusion has aged well. It bucks the trend toward upright, big-car faces (if you’re into that sort of thing, check out the Malibu), but it’s appealing all the same. I thought the short front overhang and long tail looked lean and athletic — no doubt a subconscious gesture to the fact that I am neither.\n\nSixteen-inch steel wheels are standard, with optional alloy wheels available in 16-, 17- and 18-inch diameters. My only gripe is with the clear-lens taillights, a styling cue that never should have left the aftermarket. Get a Fusion in gray, like my test car, and they blend in a bit better.\n\nThe Inside\nI wish the Fusion’s interior had aged as well as the exterior. Its wraparound dashboard is soft to the touch but finished in a grainy texture that looks inferior to some of the more common materials you’ll find in this class. Certain elements are especially dated — most obviously the stereo system, which still sits in a square cutout; competitors have long since integrated theirs into their surroundings. The automatic climate control in my test car had the same design, complete with chrome accents, as the ones in Ford’s larger Taurus, but while those buttons press down with well-cushioned clarity, these don’t feel quite so solid. (At the Chicago Auto Show several weeks ago, I verified this by sitting back-to-back in a Fusion and Taurus.)\n\nI also stole some time in a Fusion SE at the show, and the manual climate controls felt flimsy and imprecise compared to the ones in the base-model Camry and Accord across the floor. The seats, too, seem narrow and stiff, and some of the interior panels were poorly finished. Check out the photos above to see more.\n\nFord’s Sync audio system is new this year and should become available in most Ford, Lincoln and Mercury models by 2010. I’ve separated my critique of it into a section at the bottom of this review. Suffice it to say, the system has certain limitations that aren’t immediately obvious in how it’s marketed.\n\nHeadroom and legroom is adequate, though no spot feels especially spacious. The Fusion’s redemption comes in its cargo space, which is easily one of the best you’ll find in a family car. The trunk boasts a low lift-over height and a healthy 15.8 cubic feet of volume, and the 60/40-split rear seats fold with release handles at the lip of the trunk. The seatbacks are spring-loaded, too, so they fall forward without you needing to pull them down from the backseat or push something against them from the trunk. If you have fragile cargo — say, a lamp — the Fusion can be a godsend.\n\nRoominess Compared\n \tPassenger volume (cu. ft.)\tCargo volume (cu. ft.)\nHonda Accord\t106.0\t14.0\nHyundai Sonata\t105.4\t16.3\nToyota Camry\t101.4\t14.5 — 15.0*\nNissan Altima\t100.7\t15.3\nFord Fusion\t96.9 — 100.7**\t15.8\nChevrolet Malibu\t97.7\t15.1\nSource: Automakers; all passenger volumes are without moonroofs.\n*14.5 cu. ft. in SE, XLE; 15.0 cu. ft. in CE and LE.\n**96.9 cu. ft. with AWD; 100.7 cu. ft. with FWD.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Fusion earned the top score, Good, in both frontal and side impacts. Standard safety features include front and side-impact airbags for the front seats, as well as side curtain airbags for both rows. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. Per federal requirements for 2008, so is a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nUnfortunately, an electronic stability system is still missing. The feature isn’t as necessary as it might be in an SUV, but its wide availability among competitors — it’s standard on the Accord and Sonata and optional on the Camry, Altima and Malibu — makes the Fusion’s omission less acceptable.\n\nThe backseat includes Latch child seat anchors for the outboard positions, though I found them buried a bit deep in the cushions. Top-tether anchors for all three seats are clearly marked on the rear shelf. Note, however, that the rear head restraints are little more than extensions of the seatback; they keep visibility out the rear window unobstructed, but I’m dubious about the whiplash protection they’ll provide for taller passengers.\n\nReliability scores are promising, with ’06 and ’07 models earning above-average or excellent scores for overall reliability from Consumer Reports. Ford’s powertrain and bumper-to-bumper warranties aren’t as impressive as GM’s or Hyundai’s, but they generally match what Toyota and Honda offer.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the Fusion S starts at just $18,010 — some $2,000 less than the Accord or Malibu. It comes impressively equipped at that, with power windows and locks, keyless entry, cruise control, A/C and a CD stereo. The Fusion SE is the real steal: It adds 16-inch alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat and an upgraded stereo with steering-wheel controls — and costs just $925 more. The Fusion SEL ($20,025) upgrades to 17-inch rims and automatic climate control, among other features.\n\nAn automatic transmission costs $875. The V-6 engine, available on the SE and SEL, adds $2,750 but includes the automatic transmission. All-wheel drive adds $1,850 and can only be had with the V-6. Other options include heated leather seats, a moonroof, rear parking sensors, a navigation system and Sync. Some luxury features available elsewhere in this class, like a power passenger seat and dual-zone climate control, are not offered.\n\nExpect an all-wheel-drive Fusion SEL to top out around $30,000.\n\nFusion in the Market\nPut the Fusion toe-to-toe with its competition, and it comes up short in a lot of ways. The cabin is starting to show its age, and the engines are both underwhelming and inefficient — a paradoxical combination, and not a good one at any rate. But like most aging products, Ford gives this car a handsome discount: For the cost of a modestly equipped Accord or Malibu, you could get a well-heeled Fusion with cash to spare. The fact that it can edge both cars out in a few areas is a testament to its continued viability, and it means bargain hunters will find the compromises few.\n\nSync or Swim?\nMicrosoft helped develop Sync, which uses voice recognition software to play songs from your MP3 player, as well as make and receive hands-free phone calls. Sync is optional on the Fusion SE and standard on the SEL.\n\nThe feature works by indexing the songs off an iPod, Zune or other compatible MP3 player. The players plug into a USB port, and the system recognizes songs, artists, playlists and album titles. I found audio quality to be superior to that of an MP3 player plugged into an auxiliary jack (though there is one next to the USB plug should you need it). The USB plug-in also charges the MP3 player and turns it off when you get out of the car. Auxiliary plugs do neither, and I’ve returned many a morning to find my iPod’s battery dead.\n\nSync could be a smash hit for audiophiles with short attention spans, as it allows you to switch from one song to another at the slightest whim. Others might not enjoy having to talk to their stereo to get it to work — and, in some cases, upgrading their MP3 software on a home computer.\n\nFor me, the system was more a pain than anything else. Try as I might, I couldn’t get my iPod to start playing songs when I got back into the car unless I pressed a button on the steering wheel, waited for Sync’s audio chime and said “USB.” Sync engineer Jeff Ostrowski said that was likely because my iPod had outdated firmware; properly updated devices should play songs right away, he said. What’s more, a number of songs on my iPod are apparently missing metadata — the litany of electronic tags that code everything from genre to album title for each MP3. Songs from legitimate sources like iTunes or a purchased CD usually have all this data embedded, Ford spokesman Alan Hall said, which allows Sync to easily categorize them. Without such information, however, many songs won’t show up on request. I found this out the hard way: Asking for The Who (burned off a friend’s computer) got me Queen (purchased on iTunes), and AC/DC’s “Shoot to Thrill” (same computer) produced Jane’s Addiction’s “Superhero” (iTunes again).\n\nI’ll admit I have plenty of music from shared sources or downloaded during the Napster days. (A man in a black suit is approaching my door right now.) But so do countless other drivers, and having such songs go MIA is mighty frustrating. Missing metadata packs a second punch: Sync allows you to refine your search within an artist or playlist to show the albums, a convenient feature if you have a number of albums under a single band. But when I tried to refine my searches, the system told me it couldn’t comply. Hall said that’s likely because all the songs within the artist weren’t properly encoded.\n\nThe order in which Sync plays your songs can be frustrating, too. It played songs in the correct order if I asked it to play an album or playlist, but when I called out an artist — say, the Smashing Pumpkins — it jumped arbitrarily from one album to another, ignoring the order of songs I’d set for the Pumpkins on my iPod. Hall said that’s because in many cases Sync defaults to alphabetical ordering.\n\nI didn’t get a chance to test out the phone operation, as my Blackberry wasn’t compatible beyond basic Bluetooth functions. Ford says Sync can read text messages and send one of 15 replies, which could prove useful.\n\nHall said that down the road Sync will partner seamlessly with the car’s navigation system, so you could press a button and say “find the nearest gas station.” Right now the two systems work on separate levels. The day that sort of integration comes — and all my MP3s are tagged correctly — I might be sold, but right now I’m turned off by the system’s limitations. Perhaps I’m the wrong market for it, as I usually just listen to whatever’s on the radio. Cars.com editor and Zune user David Thomas, on the other hand, is a serious music listener, and he raved about the feature.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The pothole appeared out of the dark and rain in the midst of an otherwise smooth stretch of roadway. This was no one-thump-and-done bump – because of its size (width and depth), I quickly realized there was no way to avoid impact. Today’s test car – the all-wheel-drive version of the 2008 Ford Fusion SEL – was about to get the type of extreme test you don’t want to give your own car.\n\nThere was just enough time to grip the wheel tighter and hope I didn’t loosen any teeth or fillings. The Fusion sits low, and as we hit, I feared for the tires, wheels, and even the bodywork. Amazingly, the car took the pothole with aplomb, much as a wide-track catamaran would handle a big ocean wave – smoothly, with no giant thud. A glance in the rearview mirror showed the pickup truck following us also was unable to dodge the pothole. But the ensuing bouncing headlights showed it didn’t handle the challenge nearly as well as the Fusion.\n\nWhile there’s no such thing as a perfect suspension that will please all of the people all of the time, there are times when a suspension is right for a vehicle. We found the Fusion’s underpinnings to be just that. Ford has done a nice job of building a vehicle that can compete in a market segment that has been dominated by Toyota (Camry), Honda (Accord), and Nissan (Altima).\n\nWhile the standard 160-horsepower, four-cylinder engine and the 3.0-liter, 221 horsepower V6 were not acceleration champions, they work sufficiently with the car’s handling to make this a nice driver’s vehicle.\n\nThe V6 all-wheel-drive version we tested was comfortable, with automatic headlights, heated exterior mirrors with puddle lamps, automatic climate control, leather steering wheel, and a distinctive (but sometimes hard-to-read) analog clock.\n\nAnd Ford’s SYNC system allowed even this sometimes-technology-challenged driver to integrate a cellphone into the car’s system. Not only did the car recognize the phone, but it also downloaded its address book into the system’s memory. That was a surprise that added functionality to the driving experience.\n\nI left it to my grown daughters to appraise Ford’s ambient lighting option – a $295 feature that allows the driver (or passenger) to choose one of seven colors for the ambient lights in the front foot wells and cupholders. Their response: “Why?” Interestingly, $295 was the same price for heated front seats or a reverse sensing system, both of which are more practical add-ons.\n\nThe Fusion also features more interior space than the established all-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy sedan, which set the standard for this kind of vehicle. It comfortably seats five, including full-sized adults in the rear. Additionally, it has plenty of cargo capacity. The rear seats fold flat for temporarily increasing that capability, as does the passenger’s seat.\n\nThe driving position seems high, even though the Fusion sits low.\n\nThe seats are positioned to have you facing out a good-size front windshield.\n\nBut there’s a downside: You have to look down at the instrument panel. That’s not bothersome with the main instrument cluster, but the center stack is another matter. We would have sacrificed the storage bin atop the dashboard to move the navigation screen – and with it the audio and climate controls – higher.\n\nOur driving experience came in weather conditions that ranged from warm to cold, and snow to rain.\n\nThe Fusion handled all with aplomb with the exception of the wipers icing up during a heavy snow squall. We averaged 19.1 miles per gallon, a bit less than we would prefer, but representative in the new EPA rating system.\n\nStill, it’s a reason we are eager to get an early look at the hybrid version of the Fusion reportedly in the works.\n\nIt’s supposed to be based on the same system used in the Escape, Ford’s small SUV.\n\nLet’s just hope they keep that pothole-taming suspension.\n\n——————————\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nBase price/as tested $24,385 -$28,980 Fuel economy 19.1 miles per gallon in Globe testing\n\nTHE EARLY LINE\n\nFord’s entry in the midsized sedan market is a nice package that adds reliability to the company’s resume.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\n\nDrivetrain 3.0-liter V6, with six-speed automatic transmission, and optional all-wheel-drive system\n\nSeating 5 passengers\n\nHorsepower 221\n\nTorque 205 lb.-ft.\n\nOverall length 109.2 inches\n\nWheelbase 107.4 inches\n\nHeight 57.2 inches\n\nWidth 72.2 inches\n\nCurb weight 3,325 pounds\n\nTHE SKINNY\n\nNice touch The slightly convex side mirrors do a good job of covering blind spots.\n\nAnnoyance The gearshift lever can be easily be moved past Drive and into Low range if you’re not paying close attention.\n\nWatch for A hybrid version that’s in the works.\n\nConsider shopping it against Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima, Saturn Aura, Subaru Legacy, Toyota Camry",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed 2017 Ford Fusion is improved in key areas, including a better multimedia system, updated safety technology and driver aids that enhance the car’s satisfying cabin and driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The Fusion offers a more robust feature set and has the best technology integration and a higher-quality interior than its peers, but consumers will pay a premium for that quality.\n\nThough Ford has given the 2017 Fusion midsize sedan an extensive refresh, it’s easy to miss at first glance. Not much has changed on the exterior, but big updates to the interior, safety systems and technology make this a smarter, savvier Fusion. It impressed me with how well it drove and how easy it was to live with. Compare the 2017 Fusion with last year’s model here.\n\nThe Ford Fusion competes in a crowded class against popular cars like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Volkswagen Passat, the last of which recently won our 2017 Midsize Sedan Challenge. See how the 2017 Fusion compares with those cars here.\n\nTwo new trim levels have been added to the Fusion for 2017: Sport and Platinum, which join the returning S, SE and Titanium models. I tested both an SE and a Platinum. The Ford Fusion Sport model isn’t set to debut until late summer.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nAt first glance, it doesn’t seem that much on the exterior has changed; the styling of last year’s model is still very much intact. The grille has been widened slightly, and Titanium, Sport and Platinum models get updated headlight clusters with LED headlights (they’re optional on the SE). These changes give the front some added sleekness, but you’ll be hard pressed to tell one apart from last year’s model, even at a short distance.\n\nSixteen-inch alloy wheels, a chrome grille finish and LED taillights are standard, while the SE adds 17-inch nickel wheels and LED daytime running lights. Titanium models get even more exterior features, including 18-inch wheels, a rear spoiler, dual exhaust and power side mirrors (which include memory on Titanium trims). To that, Platinum models add a unique grille and 19-inch wheels.\n\nSport models have a bunch of visual cues to hint at their performance potential, including 19-inch alloy wheels, deeper front air inlets, a black mesh front grille and quad exhaust pipes.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI drove two of the three engines that carry over essentially unchanged from 2016, but not the one that’s new for this year: a 325-hp, twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6, available in Sport trims. The Ford Fusion SE I tested came with the smaller, 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine and standard front-wheel drive, while the Platinum I drove had the more powerful, 2.0-liter EcoBoost and AWD.\n\nI came away from driving both engines feeling slightly underwhelmed. Power is there when you need it from both of the turbocharged four-cylinders – boasting 181 and 231 horsepower, respectively — but you have to work to get it. The engines’ tuning (and the transmission’s shift logic) seemed more suited to gas mileage than performance. The 1.5-liter engine can be had only in the SE, while the 2.0-liter is optional in the SE and standard in the Titanium and Platinum. The base engine, which is standard in the S and SE, is a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission option, and it gets paddle shifters in Titanium and Platinum models.\n\nWhat did impress me about the Ford Fusion was its athleticism. Our editors praised the handling and ride of the previous generation, and those characteristics remain. The platform’s rigidity is evident when the road gets bendy, and the Fusion clearly knows how to take a corner (or 10). I also found the suspension to be pliant and comfortable in everyday use, as well — a happy medium.\n\nFor 2017, the 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine adds stop-start capability to improve fuel economy. Ford’s execution of this kind of system is typically top-of-the-line, and this application is no exception. After a few hours in the car, I started to forget the feature was there. Startup happens seamlessly and quietly, without much hesitation.\n\nThe Fusion Sport’s new engine has much more power than you’ll find in anything else in this class, and it also boasts standard all-wheel drive and an adaptive suspension that adjusts firmness on the fly. With these enhancements, Ford aims to have the only bona fide performance sedan in this class.\n\nThe Fusion’s gas mileage puts it toward the bottom of the midsize body type class. EPA-estimated fuel economy for the base engine is 21/32/25 mpg city/highway/combined. The 1.5-liter EcoBoost gets the best marks, at 23/34/27 mpg, while the 2.0-liter EcoBoost returns an estimated 21/31/25 mpg with front-wheel drive and 20/29/23 with all-wheel drive. Each of these engines takes regular fuel.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the Fusion gets a redesigned center console. The conventional shifter is gone, replaced by a rotary shifter, which opens up space for added storage and makes for a less cluttered design.\n\nThough not as large as some competitors’, I found the Ford Fusion’s backseat to have enough room to fit adults in the outboard seats comfortably for longer trips.\n\nTitanium models add leather-wrapped upholstery, but the real star is the Platinum, which gets quilted leather seats that I really liked. In fact, I found the Platinum’s fit and finish to be on par with most luxury vehicles, and it was very quiet and comfortable on the road.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe Fusion’s multimedia system got a major update for 2017, with the addition of Sync 3 and a few other helpful technologies. Sync 3 is the best iteration of Ford’s Sync system to date; its usability and responsiveness have both gotten much better. As car multimedia systems go, Sync 3 is at the top for me alongside Uconnect, which is found in Fiat Chrysler America vehicles.\n\nSync 3 is available as an option starting on SE models, and it’s standard on Titanium and Platinum trims. Coming along with it are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which give users even more flexibility. Paired with Sync, these smartphone interfaces are a way to incorporate on-screen navigation functionality without paying extra for the factory navigation system, which is an additional option.\n\nFord is also introducing a new technology for 2017, called Sync Connect. The system adds cellular hardware to the car itself, allowing remote access to features like lock/unlock, vehicle status reports and remote start via a smartphone app. Sync Connect is available on Titanium trims and standard on the Platinum.\n\nCharging points for portable devices have also proliferated in the Ford Fusion refresh. There are two 12-volt outlets and two USB ports up front, plus another 12-volt outlet and an optional 110-volt household socket in back for even more charging. On higher trim levels, those USB ports charge at 2.5 amps (versus 1.5 amps on lower trims). That’s better suited to charging phones (and even tablets) quickly.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Fusion has 16.0 cubic feet of cargo room, which puts it at the top end of the pack (the Passat, Accord and Camry have between 15.4 and 15.9 cubic feet). A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard on all trim levels.\n\nInterior storage has gotten much better with the new rotary shift knob and redesigned console. The low-profile knob makes it easier to access the large storage cubby under the climate controls, and there’s a new pocket lined with grippy leather designed to hold your phone in place, either upright or lying on its side.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Fusion’s refresh added many safety features and driver aids, and the Platinum model I tested came with all of them.\n\nWhile many of the features themselves are not completely new to the Fusion, Ford added lots of functionality to them. The forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, for instance, gets pedestrian detection; park assist can now steer into perpendicular spaces in addition to parallel parking; and the adaptive cruise control adds stop-and-go capability. Stop and go means the system won’t automatically shut off as the car comes to a stop, like many other systems do. So when you’re in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the Fusion will come to a complete stop then proceed on its own once traffic starts moving again.\n\nThe adaptive cruise control impressed me. I live in a high-traffic area, so having the system work in dense congestion is a godsend. If you’re stopped in traffic for more than three seconds the system turns off, but just a press of the “resume” button or a tap of the gas pedal is enough to get it started again. One other thing I liked: Some systems turn off once the car stops then let the car start to roll forward, but the Fusion keeps the brakes engaged, keeping you in place until you tell it to move again.\n\nForward collision warning, blind spot warning, park assist and adaptive cruise control are not available on S models but are optional on SE and Titanium trims. Platinum models get everything standard.\n\nEquipped with front crash prevention technology, the 2017 Ford Fusion earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest ratings in all categories. See a comprehensive list of the Fusion’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThis class is tightly bunched when it comes to price, and the Ford Fusion mostly falls in line with the competition. S models start at $23,485 including an $875 destination charge, while the SE is $24,485 and the Titanium checks in at $31,485. At the top end of the spectrum, however, the Fusion Platinum pushes the segment’s price limit to new heights, starting at $37,495. As equipped, the Platinum vehicle I tested was higher still: $40,080 thanks to added all-wheel drive, inflatable rear seat belts and its burgundy red paint (seen in the photos).\n\nThat’s a lot of scratch, considering a Camry with an upgraded engine and all the safety/technology boxes checked costs only $35,075. An Accord in the same configuration comes to $35,665 and the Passat is $35,090.\n\nCharacterizing the Fusion’s value is a difficult proposition. Even if you drop down to a Titanium, adding those advanced safety features pushes the price tag to $34,995 — and you’ll still be missing navigation, which is present on its competitors at that price. The Platinum, however, has the best interior and more features/technology (with better integration) than any of its competitors. The Ford Fusion’s price tag will dissuade some buyers, but the good news is, at least if you opt for a Platinum, you’ll get what you pay for.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford Fusion?\n\nThe Ford Fusion is a mid-size sedan that seats up to five people. A 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, but a selection of turbocharged engines is available, including a 325-hp, twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6 that goes in the Sport trim level. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid (Energi) variants are also offered. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Competitors include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford Fusion?\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high-beam headlights. The sedan also gets front and rear styling updates.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford Fusion Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, cloth upholstery, a 60/40, split-folding backseat, cruise control, rain-sensing windshield wipers and push-button start. Available features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a power moonroof, remote start, an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, navigation, a Sony premium stereo, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford Fusion?\n\nThe Fusion’s ride and handling is a highlight, along with the performance-oriented Sport trim level, which is fun to drive. The available Sync 3 touchscreen multimedia system is easy to use, but the backseat is cramped, and thick roof pillars limit forward visibility. The Fusion was last redesigned for the 2013 model year and is nearing the end of its run; Ford has said this will be the final generation of the sedan.",
