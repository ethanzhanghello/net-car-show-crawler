      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Escort used to be one of Fords best-selling models, but it plays a smaller role now that the Focus has taken over as the high-volume small car. The Escort survives as a four-door sedan available as a fleet vehicle for daily car-rental companies and other high-volume customers. The sporty ZX2 coupe is still available to consumers.\n\nFord hasnt said when Escort production will end, but there may not be a 2002 version of the sedan, and the ZX2 might stay in production longer.\n\nExterior\nThe front-drive Escort sedan and ZX2 coupe share a 98.4-inch wheelbase, but the coupe is about an inch longer at 175 inches overall. The coupes unique, sportier styling is aimed at a younger audience.\n\nInterior\nThe front bucket seats provide enough room for most adults to fit comfortably, but the rear seat has limited headroom and knee room in both body styles. The rear seatback folds to expand the trunk in both the sedan, 12.8 cubic feet, and the coupe, 11.8 cubic feet.\n\nThe modern dashboard has easy-to-read gauges and controls conveniently grouped in the center in what Ford calls an integrated control panel. A cassette player is standard, and a premium sound system with a six-CD changer is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Escort sedan comes with a 114-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and the ZX2 uses a dual-camshaft version that generates 130 hp. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.Antilock brakes also are optional.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "My first stint behind the wheel of a Ford Escort was not pleasant. It was 1983 or thereabouts, several years before I became an automotive writer, and the Escort in question was a Hertz rental in Los Angeles.\n\nThe car was awful. Even allowing for the suspect nature of it being a rental, it was wretched, it shook, it rattled, it stalled out at stop lights. I was so disgusted I took it back to the airport the next day and demanded a replacement.\n\nThose were the darkest days for U.S.-built cars, and that Escort seemed to be the poster car for the “Buy Japanese” movement.\n\nSlipping behind the wheel of a 1997 Escort, it’s hard to imagine that it is even remotely related to that rental from hell. In reality, only the name remains the same.\n\nFord has spent nearly 15 years perfecting its small car formula, and even before the appearance of the new ’97 model, buyers apparently agreed that the Escort had gotten pretty good – it has ranked among the top 10 bestselling cars in America for more than five years.\n\nThe 1997 model moves one step closer to perfection.\n\nThe test car being discussed here is the sportiest of Escorts, the ZX2 coupe. But many of the attributes that make the ZX2 a ball to drive can be found in the more utilitarian Escort.\n\nLet’s start with the chassis. One of Ford’s consultants is world champion Formula One driver Jackie Stewart, who is highly critical of the notion that only sports cars have to handle well. He has pushed Ford to treat all of its cars as performance vehicles when it comes to cornering and braking — which can pay off in everyday driving situations, like accident avoidance.\n\nThat philosophy shows up in the Escort. It is very responsive to steering inputs, and even the base car has predictable understeer and not a lot of body roll.\n\nOn the ZX2, the performance edge is honed a little further. The basic setup is the same, but changes to items like suspension bushings, shock absorbers and springs give the ZX2 a sports-car feel.\n\nThe base Escort’s two-liter, 110-horsepower four-cylinder engine is adequate for most driving. It won’t pin you to your seat, but it will move the 2,500-pound, four-door sedan with alacrity.\n\nOn the ZX2, the engine is a 16-valve, double-overhead camshaft two-liter that produces 130 horsepower. The addition of 20 horses makes the Escort a nifty runner. It takes about nine seconds to get to 60 mph, with the multivalve four singing to its 6,000 rpm redline.\n\nTransmission choices are a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic. The automatic on the ZX2 doesn’t dilute the performance aspect too much, but most buyers will want the five-speed. On a base Escort sedan, go for the automatic unless you just like shifting gears.\n\nOn styling, the new Escort is as handsome as any compact out there. Ford has built on the Taurus/Contour design theme, so you’ll know the Escort is part of the Blue Oval crowd.\n\nSeating is very comfortable for four in the sedan, with enough leg room and head room in the back for two adults.\n\nFor the coupe, Ford opted to not just chop two doors out of the sedan. All of the coupe’s body panels are unique, and the car is slightly longer and wider than the sedan.\n\nOn the inside, the steering wheel, radio and air-conditioning controls and the center console are the only items shared with the sedan. The rear seat room is, predictably, less than in the four-door Escort. Kids will be comfortable, but adults will feel cramped.\n\nThe ZX2 is available in two trim levels — base and Sport. Choose the Sport option and you get 15-inch tires mounted on five-spoke wheels, a rear spoiler and special bucket seats.\n\nThe appeal of the Escort, particularly the ZX2 Sport, is its affordability. In an era when the average new car lists for more than $20,000, the Escort, which starts at about $13,000, seems quite a bargain.\n\nAnd the ZX2, given the styling and erformance, is an affordable sporty coupe at $17,000.\nSPECS\nBase list price: $13,145\nPrice as tested: $17,550\nMajor options on test car: Preferred Equipment Group, $1,825; sport package, $595; automatic transmission, $815\nEngine: Two-liter, DOHC four-cylinder\nHorsepower: 130 @ 5,700 rpm\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\nWeight: 2,555 pounds\n0-to-60 mph: 9.5 seconds\nMileage: 25-33 mpg\nSafety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side impact beams\nCompetition: Toyota Paseo, Chevrolet Cavalier, Plymouth Neon",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Motor Co. has a cool version of a hot set of wheels in its new 1998 Ford Escort ZX2 coupe.\n\nThe ’98 ZX2 comes in “Cool” or “Hot” form and is aimed at young buyers who want to combine sporty with a brisk performance.\n\nFord hopes the ZX2 will become Generation X’s favorite vehicle. Although the ZX2 shares key components with the regular Ford Escort Sedan and Wagon, the coupe has sleek body work unique to this model, more power, and a fractionally longer overall length than the sedan.\n\nThe principal difference is a potent Zetec 2.0-liter (121-cubic inch) four-cylinder engine that delivers 130-horsepower, 20 more than the 2.0-liter motor in the sedan or wagon. Suspension is tuned to deliver maximum responsiveness to agility and driver control. The interior features an asymmetrical instrument panel that blends into the door surfaces. And frameless door glass adds to the lean look.\n\nThe coupe is a four-passenger automobile, and, as with all coupe structures, access to the rear is not as convenient as with four doors. But when you are young, little things like that really don’t bother you.\n\nTo help things along, the driver’s seat has a memory recline device that automatically returns the seat to its original position after it is tilted for rear access.\n\nThe coupe is built on the Escort platform that has a wheelbase of 98.4 inches, the same as the sedan and wagon. But the overall length stretches just a bit, 175.2 inches vs. 174.7 for the sedan and 172.7 for the wagon.\n\nThe body contour is more sleek in appearance and lower in drag. Rounded sheet metal transforms into a slippery shape. But it also encroaches just a bit on interior room.\n\nHeadroom and shoulder room in the ZX2 are down about an inch compared to four-door Escorts. But not to worry. At 120 mph past the grandstand nobody will ever know the difference.\n\nThe Zetec is a dual overhead cam engine with four valves per cylinders Horsepower peaks at 5,750 rpm, so with a five-speed it should be possible with the rev-happy Zetec to go to about 7,000 rpm or so without the valves floating. At that engine speed you can play a little tune with the gearbox.\n\nAn optional four-speed electronically controlled automatic is offered, an $800 item. It obviously is more convenient for everyday mundane motoring. But for the youthful types who really want to go, the automatic loses the versatility of downshifting through the gears.\n\nAn interesting facet emerges from the comparison of these two powertrains. The automatic flies in the face of convention and offers a slightly better city cycle fuel mileage rating than the five-speed.\n\nThe EPA fuel economy estimates for the automatic is 25 miles per gallon vs. 26 mpg for the five-speed manual transmission. The highway rating is 33 mpg for both transmissions.\n\nConforming to the sporting touch, the front-cockpit layout is the standard individual seats separated by a center console that mounts the shift levers. Full instrumentation plus a low-fuel warn ing light are standard.\n\nThe tachometer when the coupe is equipped with the five-speed gearbox is a very viable instrument, much more so than when an automatic is on board, as it tells a driver when he or she is in danger of overreving the engine.\n\nFord groups its climate controls and audio system into what it calls its Integrated Control Panel packages that are positioned in one location. With this arrangement, drivers have easy access to the controls without losing concentration on the road.\n\nThe standard audio system in the ZX2 consists of premium speakers and a stereo system, the thinking being that younger drivers are into cool music.\n\nIf you really want to go upstream, additional individual options include items like anti-lock brakes, a power moonroof and windows, and two remote entry systems. And if you really want to be sporty, a sports package is offered that includes 15-inch aluminum wheels a rear spoiler, fog lamps, upgraded bucket seats and integrated headrests.\n\nW ith a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $13,080, a ZX2 represents a sporting proposition at an affordable cost, one that offers life in the fast lane without busting the budget.",

      "expert_review": "OUT TO POLISH ITS IMAGE, HYUNDAI GOES BUMPER TO BUMPER WITH 4 COMPETITORS.\n\nIn his day, D.O. Chung, president of Hyundai’s beleaguered U.S. operations, might have been a pretty good race-car driver.\n\nOn a slalom course set up in the parking lot of Joe Robbie Stadium, Chung, piloting a 1994 model Hyundai Elantra, slithered the compact sedan through a series of tight curves with the finesse and panache of a professional.\n\nJust ahead, another driver was putting a Saturn SL1 through the same paces.\n\n”Saturn. That is a good car. But ours is better,” said Chung as he drove.\n\nHyundai has been making a lot of noise lately in an effort to convey the message that its cars are better than most car buyers realize.\n\nBut better or not, Saturn has something Hyundai doesn’t: a good reputation.\n\nAnd that’s something Chung – as well as the rest of Hyundai – is out to change. After years of declining sales because of a poor-quality reputation, Hyundai now believes it has turned the corner and is building vehicles that can compete with the best in the market.\n\nTo test that assertion, Hyundai gathered four of the best-selling compact cars – the Ford Escort, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and the Saturn sedan – and then invited several automotive journalists to compare all the cars against the ’94 Hyundai Elantra during an afternoon of aggressive driving.\n\nIf I read the situation correctly, Hyundai officials tried to tilt the proceedings as much in their favor as possible.\n\nYes, Hyundai did have four similar-sized cars priced within about $1,500 of each other. But the Elantra on hand was a fully loaded 1994 GLS model, a car that won’t be available to dealers for a few weeks.\n\nThe ’94 Elantra has a driver’s side air bag, an environmentally friendly air conditioner and a host of other improvements not found in the ’93 models.\n\nThe four other cars were 1993 models.\n\nAlso, to make things a bit more even, Hyundai could have assembled cars that were closer in specification. For example, the Saturn SL2, with its more powerful engine, would have a better choice than the SL1. Instead of a plain Jane Ford Escort, Hyundai might have used the Escort’s sibling, Mercury Tracer LTS.\n\nBut the LTS would have eaten Hyundai’s lunch.\n\nIn any case, the comparison test was still useful. Because the cars are priced close together, shoppers are likely to compare them.\n\nAnd Hyundai officials raised a good point: Most people, when shopping for a car, first take a look at their budget to see what they can afford. They don’t usually target cars with certain features, such as 16-valve engines.\n\nIn real-world driving, you likely will find that all five cars are more than adequate in terms of performance and handling.\n\nBut driving all five cars one after another – and very aggressively at that – turned up a few surprises.\n\nHere’s a brief report on what you can expect when comparing these cars:\n\nFord Escort LX\n\nThis car was a major surprise. The Escort seemed stodgy and out of date. I didn’t like much about it.\n\nIn terms of looks, it was downright dowdy compared with the swoopy Honda Civic.\n\nBut I’ll give the Escort credit for its solid feel and its excellent fit and finish. It had a great-looking paint job, and it was built as well as a Lincoln.\n\nThe Escort’s interior, while offering plenty of room for front and rear passengers, is dreadfully plain and utilitarian. Such things as the analog gauges and the steering wheel looked chintzy.\n\nAlso, under duress, the Escort was the worst-handling car of the bunch. The steering was dull and vague, and the body leaned considerably in sharp turns. The brakes are adequate, but not confidence-inspiring, in panic situations.\n\nWhen revved the engine buzzed like a runaway chain saw.\n\nFunny thing is, not all Escorts are like this. I test-drove a Escort GT hatchback several years ago and found it to be a terrific, stylish c ar.\n\nHowever, the ultimate Escort is found at the Mercury dealer. It’s called the Mercury Tracer LTS. The Tracer sedan body is mated to the Escort GT’s high-performance, 124-horsepower engine and sports suspension system.\n\nToo bad one wasn’t available.\n\nHonda Civic LX\n\nMaybe the world has come to expect too much from Honda. For so long, every new car Honda brought out hit the competition square in the jaw like a right cross from a lightning-quick prize fighter.\n\nSo when I climbed into the bright red Civic, I expected nothing less than perfection. What I found was that the Honda is not much more than just another pretty face.\n\nIts performance, in terms of handling and acceleration, ranked no better than average for a compact car. When pushed hard around a corner, the Civic’s body leans like a person who has had a few too many drinks. But the steering wheel turns smoothly, and the steering feels nice and solid.\n\nThe interior lacks consistency. The instruments and the sweeping dash they are housed in look great. Yet the center switch cluster, which holds controls for the air conditioner and the radio, is a mass of confusion. And it looks cheap.\n\nThe Civic’s exterior looks are its strong point – and maybe enough to cross out its road-holding and interior shortcomings. This car looks classy, sporty and it is extremely well-made.\n\nHyundai Elantra\n\nIt’s time to jettison any bias you might have against Hyundai.\n\nespecially the upcoming ’94 model – is a solid and value-packed competitor. It should not be written off your shopping list based on the reputation of other, older Hyunda is.\n\nIf you test drive the Elantra and you don’t like it, that’s fine. But at least give the Elantra equal consideration. Hyundai has made major improvements.\n\nIn addition to pounding the daylights out of a 1994 model at the stadium, I put 600 miles on a 1993 Elantra in two days.\n\nThe Elantra handles well and has a tight, quality feel to it.For instance, when you slam the doors, they close with a solid thunk.\n\nElantra has an awesome, tight-turning radius. The body stays fairly straight in hard, fast cornering, and when revved, the engine is somewhat loud, though not harsh.\n\nIf the Elantra has a weak point, it is that the engine isn’t very responsive at low speeds. In fact, getting going from a stop in an Elantra with an automatic transmission is annoyingly time consuming. It seems to take forever to get rolling. However, once the engine revs to about 3,500 rpm – or about 25 mph – the Elantra performs well.\n\nThe dash layout is simple, if a bit utilitarian. The switches are big, well-labeled and easy to use.\n\nYou’ll find ample room in the front and rear, and a big, package-swallowing trunk.\n\nSaturn SL1\n\nThe Saturn is the most unique-looking small car of the lot.\n\nIt’s also one of the hottest small cars on the market.\n\nFrom a stop, the SL1 offers excellent throttle res ponse and is very peppy. The engine runs smoothly and quietly, unlike earlier models.\n\nThe Saturn’s strong point is this: It feels very solid and safe. Its big dash is reassuring – you feel as if the car could take a hard hit without driver or passengers being injured.\n\nThe SL1 also has what may be the smoothest shifting automatic transmission you’ll find in a small car.\n\nThe car is very agile and easy to steer. The SL1 handles well at moderate speeds; when pushed hard around a corner, the SL1’s tires squeal rather loudly. The brakes are strong.\n\nUp front, the sporty bucket seats do a fine job of providing good lower back support. Visibility is OK – once you get used to looking over the big dash.\n\nOn the negative side, the dash is a melange of pieces and parts that have a cobbled together look.\n\nUnlike all the other cars, the Saturn is American-built. And there’s something appealing about that.\n\nToyota Corolla\n\nI can’t say enough about the Corol la. This was far and away the best small car of the bunch, and, I think, the finest small car on the market.\n\nWhen you rev the engine, you hear the race-bred sound of quality.\n\nWhen you drive aggressively, the Corolla takes it all in stride. There’s not much protest from the tires, and the brakes grab with a hearty reassurance.\n\nThe steering is responsive, and it gives the Corolla a feeling of athletic agility.\n\nInside, the Corolla is somewhat plain-looking, but very user friendly. The cloth-covered seats, which are firm but comfortable, hold the driver in place well, and there’s plenty of room for rear passengers.\n\nIf the Corolla has a fault, it’s styling. There’s nothing wrong or out of place, it’s just a little dull and conservative.\n\nThe Corolla is quiet and unusually tight and competent. Sometimes when you test a car, you feel right away that it’s a perfect fit.\n\nThat’s the feeling you get when you drive the Corolla.",

      "expert_review": "Conceding that not every Escort buyer relishes a hatchback, Ford hasbrought out a pair of four-door notchback sedans for 1992.\n\nThe additions to the recently redesigned Escort lineup are the LX and LX- E sedans. They are called “notchbacks“ because they have trunks that slamshut to hide cargo, unlike hatchbacks.\n\nKudos to the Ford design team. Not only did it add the security of atrunk, it also pulled off a highly stylized subcompact-and one with kick to itfrom its 127-h.p. twin-cam 4-cylinder engine, the one that powers the EscortGT.\n\nOf the two sedans, we tested the LX-E. Ford calls it the performancemodel because it comes with styled aluminum wheels, 14-inch performance tires,sport suspension, four-wheel disc brakes and the 127-h.p., 1.8-liter 4-cylinder.\n\nThe LX-E offers a bonus, quick 0- to 60-m.p.h. acceleration plus highmileage. The economy rating is 23 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway with theoptional automatic ($732) our test car had and 26/31 with five-speed manual.\n\nYou have to put up with a modest groan when stepping away from the light, though it seemed less audible than the noise in a rival Saturn SL2 with 4-cylinder automatic.\n\nWhen comparing the Saturn and Escort further, it would be a standoff inride and handling. Even with the sport suspension, the LX-E had thetraditional sedan tendency to lean in turns. Uneven pavement brought somejostling.\n\nTo compare the LX-E with a Japanese rival, we felt the Ford subcompacthas the edge in styling over the Honda Civic, which recently received newsheet metal to sport the same rounded look as all Japanese cars. The LX-E alsowould get the nod in room and comfort. The Civic would be a bit more nimble,the LX-E a bit more substantial.\n\nThe LX-E with automatic transmission has a base price of $11,933, about$2,000 less than a comparable Honda Civic EX sedan, which starts at $14,525.But the Civic has driver-side air bag and anti-lock brakes as standard, which would erase about $1,000 of Escort`s price advantage.\n\nIn addition to the typical power brakes and steering as standard, the LX- E features a couple clever items. One worth noting is an arrow in theinstrument panel pointing to the left to show the location of the fuel-filler door. That`s a handy feature for multiple-car families whose drivers mayforget what side the cap is on when pulling into the station. It`s also a plusfor Escort in the rental car market. It`s a handy item that probably didn`tcost Ford more than a couple pennies to add. Nice touch.\n\nAlso, there`s a little lip on the dash that`s just big enough to catchand hold the pen or pencil that goes astray when making a turn or applying thebrakes. Another nice touch.\n\nThe LX-E has some shortcomings, however, such as a mushy brake pedal with too much play and seat backs a bit too stiff. Unlike Saturn, the LX-E offersneither driver-side air bag nor anti-lock brakes.\n\nAnd Saturn might gain another advantage this fall if rumors prove truethat the GM division will offer traction control in selected cars. Tractioncontrol is to getting a car going on slippery surfaces what ABS is to stoppinga car in a straight line on those same pavements.\n\nFord has been promoting a one-price line of Escorts from two-doornotchback to four-door wagon at only $10,499. That applies to LX models, butnot the LX-E, which starts at $11,933, or roughly $1,338 more than a SaturnSL2 sedan.\n\nOur test car included such options as a preferred equipment package at$1,298, which consisted of rear-window defroster, air conditioning, tiltsteering, cruise control and tachometer; and a power equipment group at $305, which included power windows and door locks. Other options were power moonroofat $549, premium AM/FM stereo at $138, clearcoat paint at $91 and automatictransmission at $732. With options and a $375 freight charge, the stickertotaled $15,421 before option discounts of $ 744, which brought the price down to $14,677.\n\nThe LX-E is an economy car with stylish looks, a fuel-conserving sedanthat can cart four adults and their luggage or two adults and three kids plus their groceries. The LX-E would be a good choice for young couples whoseincome levels haven`t reached managerial status without advertising that tothe world by tooling around in a Hyundai.",

      "expert_review": "Affordability has become one of the major issues in the auto industry – for consumers as well as automakers.\n\nA decade ago, the average price of a new car was a bit more than $12,000, according to the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. This year the National Automobile Dealers Association says the average price of an automobile has rolled over the $20,000 barrier.\n\nThere are many drivers who can’t – or won’t spend $20,000 on transportation. They might opt instead to pay as little as $12,000 for a subcompact with basic equipment.\n\nBut what can you get for $12,000 these days? Plenty, as proved by a test-drive of three subcompacts in that range – the Toyota Tercel, Ford Escort and Hyundai Accent.\n\nWe chose to test these three cars, which are similar in price and size, for different reasons:\n\nThe Tercel, one of Toyota’s best-selling cars, is a high-quality automobile and the most affordable car the company offers in the U.S. market.\n\nThe Ford Escort is a versatile, well-built car and a perennial best-seller.\n\nThe Accent, Hyundai’s new addition, is the vehicle the company is banking on to repair its bruised reputation among entry-level buyers.\n\nWe drove entry-level models – stripped of electric gadgets and price-bloating knickknacks – for a week, logging about 300 miles in each in combined city and highway driving.\n\nAlthough the Toyota ($12,471), Ford ($12,110) and Hyundai ($11,217) are priced within several hundred dollars of each other, there are big differences in how the cars are equipped once you get beyond air conditioning, radios and dual air bags.\n\nThe lower end of the new car market is where you really have to do your homework to be a smart shopper and to get the best deal. Just because economy cars are priced the same doesn’t mean they come with the same equipment. In fact, our test shows that some cars give you more equipment for less money.\n\nTo make an informed buy, you have to do more than go for a quick spin around the block. First, look at each car’s warranty. Then check out things like the rear seat – some small cars have rear seats that fold forward, making a rather small sedan a bit more versatile. Last, look for the small things. For instance, does the car have intermittent windshield wipers, a cupholder and two outside mirrors?\n\nValue figured heavily in choosing the best of this week’s cars. In fact, the car I selected as best wasn’t necessarily the best-engineered.\n\nThe Toyota Tercel is all-new for 1995, not a gussied-up older model. The Accent, which replaces the Excel, is new to Hyundai line up for 1995. The Ford Escort has been around in its current form since the spring of 1990.\n\nHere’s how the cars stack up.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nVirtually all new small cars these days are equipped with a four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. Our test cars were no exception.\n\nThe Escort has an 88-horsepower, 1.9-liter four-cylinder engin e with two valves per cylinder. The Tercel’s 1.5-liter engine has four valves per cylinder and generates 93 horsepower. The Accent also has a 1.5-liter four-cylinder; horsepower is rated at 92.\n\nThe Accent’s engine is noteworthy for two reasons: It is the first engine Hyundai has ever developed in-house (previous Hyundais used Mitsubishi engines), and it has three valves per cylinder. It’s an uncommon setup.\n\nGenerally, a multivalve engine – one with more than two valves per cylinder – runs smoother, but with less power at low speeds, as is true with the Accent. The performance comes when the engine is revved up.\n\nOf the three test cars, the Tercel’s engine was far and away the most refined. It ran with a whisper-smooth demeanor, offered good overall performance and delivered excellent fuel economy. But it was connected to an outmoded four-speed manual transmission. The Tercel may be the only car left on the market you can buy with a four-speed manual; virtually all other automakers offer a five-speed gearbox.\n\nIn city driving, the lack o f a fifth gear isn’t going to be noticed in the Tercel. But when you take it on the highway where cruising speeds are often 65 mph or more, the Tercel needs a fifth gear so that its engine can work less hard and be more frugal.\n\nThe Tercel’s transmission shows why it’s important to look closely at what you can get for your money. The Ford Escort – which sells for less than the Tercel comes with a five-speed manual. And the Hyundai, which is priced at even less than the Escort, is outfitted with a four-speed automatic.\n\nIn any case, the Tercel is easy to drive. The clutch pedal does not require much pressure to push down, and the shifter, though not particularly smooth, is fast-acting.\n\nThe Ford Escort, which also came with a standard transmission, requires a bit more effort to drive. The clutch pedal seems a bit on the stiff side, and it is sometimes difficult to find the right gear when shifting. On several occasions I jabbed and poked in vain trying to engage reverse.\n\nThe Escort’s performance, however, is very pleasing. It pulls strongly from a stop and delivers good midrange power. Its engine is not as smooth as the Tercel’s, but it is still a very civilized and balanced power plant.\n\nOn long highway trips, the Escort was the best of the three cars. Its engine settles into a nice groove at 65 mph in fifth gear, which also helps the car to be more frugal at the gas pump.\n\nThe new Hyundai Accent surprised me. This car is proof that Hyundai is serious about building affordable, higher-quality cars.\n\nIts engine is smoother and quieter than the four-cylinder in a new Nissan Sentra I tested recently. Still, it ranked last among the power plants among today’s test-drive trio.\n\nWhen I took the Accent on a grueling four-hour stop-and-go drive in 90 degree heat on back roads from Orlando to Lakeland, the car performed admirably. But in quick acceleration, as from a stoplight, engine noise became a bit intrusive.\n\nThe Accent’s automatic transmission was a bit unrefined. In some instances, such as shifts from first gear to second, the transmission wasn’t as smooth as the automatics in many other subcompacts. A button near the shifter lets the driver switch from Power to Economy modes, a nice touch for an inexpensive automobile.\n\nIf you don’t want to drive a stick shift and want to spend only about $12,000, you’ll find your choices limited. Aside from the Hyundai Accent, I can think of maybe one or two cars in that price range that offer a four-speed automatic.\n\nOur dark purple Accent delivered 26 mpg in city driving and 34 mpg on the highway. The grey Tercel checked in with 32 mpg in the city and 37 mpg on the highway. The teal Escort returned 25 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway. All three vehicles used the least expensive grade of unleaded.\n\nOverall, I would rank the Tercel as the best-engineered subc ompact of our trio, followed by the Escort and the Accent.\n\nHANDLING\n\nWhen it came to steering, handling and braking, the three cars performed well – but again, the Toyota had a clear edge over the competition.\n\nFor a small car, the Tercel is uncommonly quiet over rough pavement and bumps. Its suspension system – McPherson struts up front and a rear torsion beam – helps to contain noise as well as make the car agile, nimble and easy to drive.\n\nOur Tercel did not have power steering, as the other two cars did, but it was fairly easy to maneuver in tight spaces. And once the Tercel is moving, I didn’t notice the lack of power steering.\n\nAll three cars came with front disc/rear drum brakes. The Tercel was the only one outfitted with anti-lock brakes, an $825 option that pushed the price past that of the Escort and Accent.\n\nThe Tercel can handle most driving situations with ease. However, its rather skinny 13-inch tires can be made to squeal and loset heir grip in fast cornering, such as would be done to avoid an accident.\n\nThe Escort felt a bit stiff compared with the Tercel and the Accent. But our test Escort, delivered with just 35 miles on the odometer, had yet to be broken in. After 300 miles it had loosened up a bit; the brakes and clutch began working smoother, and the car felt a bit easier to drive.\n\nThe Escort’s greater weight – it is the heaviest of the trio by more than 200 pounds – robbed it of any sporty feeling. Rather, the Escort delivers a solid and smooth ride. Its four-wheel independent suspension system enables the car to handle competently.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system has a weighted feel, but it responds quickly and crisply.\n\nI would rate the Escort’s brakes as the best of the group; they provide excellent stopping power.\n\nOver the road, Hyundai’s Accent proved to be a cut above average. The car, which also has a four-wheel independent suspension system, handled cleanly and without surprises in most driving situations. However, it bounced quite a bit when driven quickly over something such as a speed bump.\n\nThe Accent was the easiest of the trio to turn. Also, the Hyundai can turn a very tight corner.\n\nThe containment of road noise is the one major area in which the Accent could be improved. On rough pavement you hear a constant muffled roar. Yet I am tempted to forgive the Accent for this in light of its very agreeable price.\n\nThe Accent may not be as smooth and refined as the Tercel and Escort, but it comes with a generous amount of equipment, and it costs less. Think of it as a Timex, not a Rolex.\n\nIn a very close race, the Tercel tops the list again in handling, followed by the Escort and the Accent.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nNot even the Tercel’s world-class quality could make up for its spartan furnishings, and this car never lets you forget you’re in the economy class.\n\nI could not see myself driving a base model Tercel each day – though I could and would drive either an Accent or an Escort.\n\nFor starters, the Tercel came with a set of heat-absorbing vinyl seats, which were painful to sit on when first entering the car on a hot day. Worse, even after the heat was dissipated, the vinyl made me sweat. But the seats provide enough padding to be supportive.\n\nThe Tercel was the only one of the cars that didn’t have a right door-mounted mirror. I’m so used to having a door-mounted mirror on that side that it was disconcerting not to have it.\n\nTo its credit, the car was put together with Toyota’s usual fervent devotion to quality. I heard no rattles or squeaks. The dash was as simple and plain as they come, and the stalk-mounted controls for the lights and windshield washers were easy to reach and use.\n\nThe Tercel’s air conditioner was the best of the bunch. It cooled the car very quickly.\n\nThe car was the only two-door of the three, but it was fairly easy for an ave rage-sized person to flip the Tercel’s front seats forward and get into the back. Rear-seat passengers are likely going to be find enough room to be comfortable.\n\nThe Escort also proved to be a comfortable and user-friendly subcompact, but several of its interior parts look dated – especially the square plastic trim where the ends of the dash meet the leading edges of the inner door sills. The controls and switches also are not as well-designed as those in the Tercel.\n\nA strong air conditioner is an important feature in vehicles that travel Central Florida’s roads. Accent’s air-conditioning system didn’t deal well with recent 90-degree heat, taking much too long to begin to cool the car. However, once the lever-operated unit got going, it did a reasonable job of cooling.\n\nI would rank the cloth-covered bucket seats in the Escort as the best among the three cars. They are, in fact, close to great. They have generous padding and are comfortable on long trips.\n\nThe Hyundai’s seats also were good,although it was sometimes hard to find a comfortable driving position. I felt the seat was either too far from or close to the pedals and dash.\n\nOf our three test cars, the black decorative upholstery in the Accent was the most attractive.\n\nWhat wasn’t attractive were the rattles I heard in the Accent. Frankly, I thought Hyundai was past that, but over bumpy roads I heard some squeaking coming from plastic trim parts. The other two cars were quiet.\n\nAll three cars came with very basic analog gauges for fuel, temperature and speedometer. The Hyundai’s gauges can be obscured by glare, and the gauges in the Ford are not well lighted. The Toyota’s are flawless – they are cleanly designed and clear, but a little boring.\n\nVisibility in the Tercel and Accent is excellent, but the Escort has a very thick rear pillar that partially blocks side vision.\n\nI found the Escort five-door offered the best combination of comfort, utility and space. With the rear seats folded forward, the Escort can swallow a box big enough to hold a full-size bicycle.\n\nTrunk room in the Accent is a bit on the short side. The car has a very stubby rear end and a fairly small trunk. The Tercel, on the other hand, has ample trunk room. The rear seats do not fold forward on either car – something to think about if you need a car that can hold large items.\n\nThe Escort came with electric side mirrors; the Accent offered intermittent windshield wipers, and the Toyota had nothing extra to distinguish it from the pack.\n\nAnd the winner is . . .\n\nI place the Escort at the head of the class in this test. In the time that the Escort has been on the market, such notable small cars as the Honda Civic, Saturn SL and Dodge/Plymouth Neon have come along and failed to knock it off the nation’s list of top 10 selling cars. And this test shows why. Even the base model offers a nice level of standard equipment, good performance, high-qualityassembly and excellent value forthe money.\n\nThe Hyundai Accent places second. I see in this car a company on the move. Hyundai is quickly learning how to build user-friendly cars that don’t fall apart.\n\nToyota’s Tercel, the best-built car of the three, is close to undriveable in Florida’s heat. The car’s vinyl interior make the car unbearable. Also, its lack of equipment makes you feel like a second-class citizen. If you opt for a better-equipped DX version, the price climbs into the $13,000 to $14,000 range – knocking out many potential buyers. Even though the Toyota was, in my view, the best engineered of the three cars, it’s not the one I would own.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1995 Ford Escort Base price: $10,970. Price as tested: $12,110. EPA rating: 30 mpg city/38 highway. Engine and drivetrain: 88-horsepower, 1.9-liter four-cylinder; five-speed manual transmission. Sa fety: Driver’s and front passenger’s air bags, side-impact protection. Warranty: Three-year, 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper; 6-year, 100,000-mile rust protection. Incentives: $300.\n\nThe bottom line: Even though the Escort is starting to show its age, it was the best of the three tested cars. It has a very solid feel, delivers good performance and is the most versatile. Escort offers the most value for the money of the three cars.",
