      "expert_review": "With its elongated roof and unrefined road manners, the first-generation Ford Probe built from 1988-’92 was a clunker.\n\nIt got off to a fast start but soon fizzled. And since 1990 the Probe has been something of an albatross around the necks of Ford dealers. Only deep discounts kept them moving.\n\nFor the 1993 model year, the Probe is back. And this time you probably can forget about any discounts.\n\nThe 1993 Probe is an all-new car. Thanks to a massive assist from Mazda, Ford got it right this time.\n\nThe new Probe is mechanically identical to Mazda’s MX-6 and 626 cars, which are built by Mazda in Flat Rock, Mich.\n\nThe styling and the handling of the new Probe are right on target. The new model is available in two flavors, mild and wild.\n\nThe mild: It has a 115-horsepower 16-valve four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe wild: It is a GT model with a high-performance V-6. That’s this week’s test car.\n\nFord officials are hoping the latest Probe will have a long run at the top.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Probe’s Mazda-built 2.5-liter aluminum V-6 is unusually smooth and very quiet.\n\nThis fast-revving 24-valve engine develops 164-horsepower and features dual overhead camshafts and electronic fuel injection.\n\nFord says the new Probe will go 0-to-60 mph in 7.5 seconds.\n\nThe engine pulls strongly all the way to 7,500 rpm. That’s when a computer intervenes and prevents the engine from being revved any higher.\n\nThe test car came with an easy-shifting five-speed transmission. The clutch has just the right feel to it. It’s light and smooth, making the car easy to drive and fun to shift fast.\n\nYou can order the Probe with a computer-controlled four-speed automatic.\n\nI drove the test car hard, but that didn’t seem to affect fuel economy. In the city, the Probe returned 20miles per gallon. On a trip to Tampa, that figure rose to 26 mpg.\n\nThe Probe GT requires unleaded premium.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe suspension layout – four-wheel independent – is the same as in the old Probe. But Ford and Mazda did some fine-tuning. The result: the new Probe is much more nimble and athletic than the old version.\n\nTorque steer was the bane of the old Probe. In that car, you stepped on the accelerator and then fought with the steering wheel to keep the car from pulling to the left or the right.\n\nThat trait is gone from the new model thanks to some mechanical improvements in the suspension system that keep both front wheels firmly planted on the pavement.\n\nAs one might expect in a $20,000 sports coupe, the Probe GT is loaded with high-performance equipment.\n\nThere are four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes, speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering and speed-rated 16-inch tires.\n\nIf you wish to slice through a curve at 50 mph, the Probe will be a willing accomplice. It understeers ever so slightly, but it does so in a manner that actually increases control of the car.\n\nOverall, the new Probe i s tight and lean and pleasing to drive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe new Probe may be based on Mazda products and built in a Mazda factory, but it is not really a Mazda.\n\nMany interior items come from other Ford products.\n\nThe air-conditioning system is nearly identical to the one Ford uses in the Taurus and Sable. There are round knobs in the center of the dash that adjust air flow and temperature.\n\nThe radio-controlled keyless entry system comes from the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nAnd Ford’s AM/FM cassette and CD player provide maximum punch.\n\nThe dash is a nicely contoured one-piece affair. The instruments are cleanly designed analog gauges set at exactly the right level. One quick glance is all it takes to glean whatever information you need.\n\nLike the old model, the new Probe offers plenty of cargo room when the split folding rear seats are lowered.\n\nRear seat passengers in the old Probe found little leg and head room.\n\nThey still will.\n\nIt’s best to think of the Probe as a two-seater. One person can sit in the rear if he or she doesn’t mind sitting side ways.\n\nAs much I liked the Probe, I still have a few nits to pick.\n\nThe air conditioner did not cope well with Florida’s upper 90-degree summer heat. It didn’t really blow cold until the car got moving at a fairly quick speed – about 30 mph – and even then it took about five minutes to cool the car.\n\nThe plastic cover behind the steering wheel buzzed.\n\nRoad noise over rough pavement was deafening.\n\nThose things aside, the aqua test car was a head-turner.\n\nThe second generation of the Probe GT is an excellent vehicle that looks great and is geared for the driving enthusiast.\n\nIt should have more staying power than the car it replaces.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Probe GT gives Ford a fast sports coupe that can do battle with such stars as the Eagle Talon, Toyota MR2, Volkswagen Corrado SLC and Nissan 240SX.",

      "expert_review": "Thank goodness that reason and sanity won out and Ford didn’t give in to those who had planned to replace the venerable Mustang with the Mazda-designed Probe sport coupe.\n\nThe Probe has grown old since it was unveiled in the 1989 model year. It may have raised a few eyebrows in 1989, but the lids have grown weary. It didn’t help that early design exercises and concepts of what was to become the Probe were stunning and expectations were sky high for a mind-boggling hunk of sheet metal. The production model was a conservative compromise.\n\nRumors are strong that Probe will put a few more years under its belt before it disappears from the Ford lineup.\n\nThe speculation is that 1997 will be Probe’s last year. In the 1998 model year, Mercury gets a small sports coupe built off the next generation Mazda 626 and Ford gets a sports coupe built off the front-wheel-drive Taurus platform. The new cars will carry familiar names-Cougar at Mercury, Thunderbird at Ford.\n\nBut that is then and this is now so on to the Probe.\n\nProbe somewhat reminds us of the Pontiac Fiero, an economy car wrapped in a sporty exterior. Base engine is a 2-liter, 118-h.p., 16-valve, 4 and the GT carries a 2.5-liter, 164-h.p., 24-valve, V-6. Despite the 24 valves, the 2.5-liter seemed to lack ambition. We expected to get slapped into the seat when the pedal was pushed to the floor. Not so. The V-6 seemed tame.\n\nFuel efficiency-20 m.p.g. city/26 highway with the V-6-further attests to Probe’s economy.\n\nPluses include dual air bags, but ABS is an option. Rear seat leg or arm room is sadly lacking, as is headroom from the pronounced roof/rear glass slant.\n\nThe list of standard equipment on the car’s window sticker pales in comparison to the optional bells and whistles.\n\nStandard equipment includes power steering, fully independent suspension, 16-inch tires, cast aluminum wheels, fog lamps, split rear folding seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, AM/FM stereo with digital clock, console with cupholder and sun visors with vanity mirrors-hardly a wealth of technology and innovation.\n\nYou have to spring for lots of options to dress Probe to go out. Check out the accompanying box listing Probe specs and the items in the optional preferred equipment package. You’d think Ford could have thrown in a few of those-such as ABS, power mirrors and rear-window defroster-as standard.\n\n>> 1995 Ford Probe GT Wheelbase: 102.8 inches Length:178.7 inches Engine: 2.5-liter, 164-h.p., 24-valve, V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 20 m.p.g. city/26 m.p.g. highway Base price: $16,545 Price as tested: $22,470.Add $4,365 for preferred equipment group that includes manual air conditioning, dual electric remote mirrors, intermittent wipers, tilt steering, cr uise control, power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, convenience lights, color-keyed front floor mats, rear window wiper/washer, power driver’s seat, ABS brakes, bodyside moldings; $790 for automatic transmission with overdrive; $270 for AM/FM stereo with compact disc player and clock; and $500 for leather bucket seats. Add $360 for freight. Pluses: Dual air bags standard. Very good mileage. Ford decided not to make this the Mustang replacement. Minuses: ABS an extra-cost option, like just about everything. Though 24-valves, the V-6 seemed focused more on mileage than performance. Rear seat room a premium. Styling won’t knock your socks off-or even make them roll down to your ankles. >>",
