      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord calls the Freestyle a crossover model because it blends the merits of a sport utility vehicle, a minivan and a sedan. Ford notes that the overall design is “more sculpted than chiseled, more capable than rugged,” so the Freestyle is “definitely not a minivan.” To head off such comparisons, Ford points out the Freestyle’s long hood, high belt line and flared wheel arches.\n\nLike the related Five Hundred sedan, the Freestyle has midsize dimensions that approach full-size. It comes in base SE, midrange SEL and top-level Limited trim levels. For 2007, four new packages offer more options for SEL and Limited models. Two new exterior colors are also offered: Alloy Metallic and Dune Pearl Metallic.\n\nExterior\nThe Freestyle has a long hood, high belt line, trapezoidal mesh grille, “grille guard”-style lower fascia, flared wheel arches and large side mirrors. The rear features a split hatch and step bumper.\n\nFog lamps and body-colored door handles are included on the SEL and Limited. Built on a 112.9-inch wheelbase, the Freestyle is 200.1 inches long overall. SE and SEL models ride on 17-inch aluminum wheels, and the Limited gets 18-inch wheels. Limited models have a monochromatic exterior and heated exterior mirrors. All Freestyles have a fully independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nThree rows of seats hold six or seven occupants. Ford says upright “command” seating eases entry and exit and produces maximum visibility. The third-row seat folds flat into the floor. Either reclining and sliding bucket seats or a 60/40-split, folding bench can be installed in the second row.\n\nA dashboard-mounted grab handle for the front passenger adds SUV style to the Freestyle. A covered storage bin sits atop the dashboard. The gearshift lever is mounted on the console, which has a power adapter to charge portable devices.\n\nWith all the seats folded — including the front-passenger seat — the Freestyle offers more than 9.5 feet of pass-thru storage. Cargo space totals 15.2 cubic feet behind the third-row seat.\n\nA six-CD changer and leather-wrapped steering wheel go into the SEL. The Limited gets heated front seats, an Audiophile sound system and perforated leather seating surfaces. A navigation system is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFord’s Duratec 3.0-liter V-6 produces 203 horsepower and 207 pounds-feet of torque and drives a continuously variable transmission. The Freestyle can be equipped with front- or all-wheel drive. Operating without any gears, the CVT unit uses two variable-size pulleys, connected by a chain, to transfer engine power to the drive wheels.\n\nSafety\nFront seat airbags are standard, and seat-mounted side-impact airbags, along with a Safety Canopy side curtain airbag system, will be standard on all models later in the 2007 model year. All-disc antilock brakes are standard, and traction control is standard on vehicles equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFord’s V-6 and CVT work beautifully to deliver eager acceleration with utter smoothness. Overall performance might trail vehicles with a conventional automatic transmission, but the Freestyle passes and merges with quick responses.\n\nRide comfort is generally good, though it’s closer to that of an SUV than a traditional wagon. Handling is ordinary but satisfactory.\n\nThe wide console creates a slightly tight feeling in an otherwise ample front seat. Second-row space — even in the center position — is snug but satisfying. Reaching the third row is more of a battle.\n\nVisibility is good despite thick rear pillars, and the controls are conveniently positioned. Facing a very low cowl, the driver gets the sensation of sitting high off the ground. Cargo space behind the third-row seat is modest, but both rows of seats fold down easily.",

      "expert_review": "Say this for the all-new 2005 Ford Freestyle: It’s appropriately named. It’s so free-verse that it defies labeling. Is it a sport-utility vehicle? A minivan with four doors? A high-riding wagon?\n\nWell, yes, on all counts.\n\nFord calls it a midsize crossover vehicle, and that describes it as well as anything. It handles like a passenger car but can carry weighty cargo and play in the mud like a true SUV.\n\nDuring a weeklong test drive, the Freestyle SEL with all-wheel drive and a continuously variable transmission was equally nimble on pavement or on a mild, off-road course about an hour’s drive north of Sacramento. And for my money, it came off as one of the best products Ford has introduced in years.\n\nSurprised? I was.\n\nYou wouldn’t expect a Ford-built crossover starting at $28,045 to draw unsolicited compliments from passersby, but that happened frequently during my week in the Freestyle. Folks liked the way it looks, and rightly so.\n\nThe Freestyle’s exterior says “racy SUV.” A long hood, flared wheel arches and rounded corners sit on top of fancy, 17-inch wheels.\n\nFord engineers said they spent many hours pondering Freestyle’s interior design, sculpting the cabin for three rows of seats that can comfortably seat up to seven – no easy chore on a vehicle a fingernail short of 200 inches in length.\n\nThey did a pretty fair job. Three hefty adults might feel squeezed in the third row – a 50/50-split bench – but there is adequate leg room to maneuver yourself free of shoulder contact with your neighboring seatmate. The tester came with a second-row bench seat split 60/40. Again, adequate leg room made that arrangement comfortable for adults.\n\nFor kids – Ford is heavily marketing the Freestyle to families – the second-and third-row benches in the SEL that I tested offered plenty of room. Translation: Good news for parents on long road trips with squirming children.\n\nFreestyle is being offered in six trim levels with varying seat configurations. Buckets, benches and folding seat backs can be found to suit virtually every taste.\n\nHappily, Freestyle’s dashboard and center stack of controls are easily understood, although I wish Ford would have used more-expensive materials in the center console, which has a low-budget, plastic feel and look.\n\nEasily the most surprising aspect of the Freestyle SEL was its handling. Its passenger-car foundation and 203-horsepower V-6 engine promised aggressive agility, but I feared the 4,100-pound vehicle would struggle during a run up the hills outside Nevada City.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nDuring a particularly steep climb on wet pavement, I kept waiting for a telltale groan from the powertrain that would indicate imminent surrender of acceleration. Nothing of the kind happened, however. It seems to be a perfect match of engine, all-wheel drive and the continuously variable transmission, which utilizes two variable-size pulleys and a metal chain.\n\nTheoretically, a CVT offers an infinite number of gear ratios, but who cares to count when even uphill accelerations are strong and seamless?\n\nOther Freestyle perks include numerous on-board storage areas – including a recessed bin that pops open at the touch of a button atop the instrument panel – and a solid body structure borrowed from Volvo, which is under the Ford Motor Co. umbrella.\n\nFord, which billed 2004 as the “year of the car,” needs a winner after coming to market late with its Five Hundred passenger car. Consequently, the company is pushing Freestyle as a vehicle that can be nearly all things to all people.\n\n“Freestyle is the crossover done right,” said Phil Martens,Ford’s group vice president for product creation.\n\n“We didn’t try to adapt an existing minivan or sport-utility platform. Freestyle is built from the ground up as a crossover with class-leading spaciousness, seven-passenger comfort, versatility and all-wheel-drive capability,” he said. “We believe these strengths give Freestyle the strongest potential to define the crossover market – much like the Ford Explorer defined SUVs a decade ago.”\n\nBut be advised that the Freestyle is not a heavyweight vehicle. Ranchers, farmers and serious haulers of cargo are more likely going to stick with their beefier SUVs and maybe even opt for full-size pickups with new hybrid technology. The Freestyle is not going to be enough vehicle for this crowd.\n\nTo that end, I think Ford has certainly carved a niche in the crossover market with the Freestyle. For families, parents transporting activity-laden kids and those whose cargo load typically includes a dozen grocery bags, the Freestyle shapes up as an ideal choice – practically sized and fairly priced.\n\nAnd bargain-hunters, take note: An entry-level Freestyle SE with front-wheel drive starts around $25,000.\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord calls the Freestyle a crossover model because it blends the merits of a sport utility vehicle, a minivan and a sedan. Built on a unique platform, the “purpose-built” Freestyle can be equipped with front- or all-wheel drive. Its 3.0-liter V-6 engine drives a continuously variable transmission.\n\nFord notes that the overall design is “more sculpted than chiseled, more capable than rugged,” so the Freestyle is “definitely not a minivan.” To head off such comparisons, Ford points out the Freestyle’s long hood, high belt line and flared wheel arches.\n\nLike the related Five Hundred sedan, the Freestyle has midsize dimensions that approach full-size. It comes in base SE, midrange SEL and top-level Limited trim levels. A navigation system is available in 2006 models.\n\nExterior\nDesigners intended to evoke the aura of Ford SUVs, starting with the wagon’s trapezoidal mesh grille. The rear features a split hatch and step bumper.\n\nFog lamps and body-colored door handles are included on the SEL and Limited. Built on a 112.9-inch wheelbase, the Freestyle is 200.7 inches long overall. SE and SEL models ride on 17-inch aluminum wheels, and the Limited gets 18-inch wheels. Limited models have a monochromatic exterior. All Freestyles have a fully independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nThree rows of seats hold six or seven occupants. Ford says upright “command” seating eases entry and exit and produces maximum visibility. The third-row seat folds flat into the floor. Either reclining and sliding bucket seats or a 60/40-split, folding bench can be installed in the second row.\n\nA dashboard-mounted grab handle for the front passenger adds SUV style to the Freestyle. A covered storage bin sits atop the dashboard. The gearshift lever is mounted on the console.\n\nA six-CD changer and leather-wrapped steering wheel go into the SEL. The Limited gets heated front seats, an Audiophile sound system and perforated leather seating surfaces.\n\nWith all the seats folded — including the front-passenger seat — the Freestyle offers more than 9.5 feet of pass-thru storage. Cargo space totals 21.2 cubic feet behind the third-row seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFord’s Duratec 3.0-liter V-6 produces 203 horsepower and 207 pounds-feet of torque. A CVT is standard. Operating without any gears, the CVT unit uses two variable-size pulleys, connected by a chain, to transfer engine power to the drive wheels. The Freestyle can be equipped with front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Ford’s optional Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbag system provides head protection in all three rows.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFord’s V-6 and CVT work beautifully to deliver eager acceleration with utter smoothness. Overall performance might trail vehicles with a conventional automatic transmission, but the Freestyle passes and merges with quick responses.\n\nRide comfort is generally good, though it’s closer to that of an SUV than a traditional wagon. Handling is ordinary but satisfactory.\n\nThe wide console creates a slightly tight feeling in an otherwise ample front seat. Second-row space — even in the center position — is snug but satisfying. Reaching the third row is more of a battle.\n\nVisibility is good despite thick rear pillars, and the controls are conveniently positioned. Facing a very low cowl, the driver gets the sensation of sitting high off the ground.. Cargo space behind the third-row seat is modest, but both rows of seats fold down easily.",
