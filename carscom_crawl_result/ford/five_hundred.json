      "expert_review": "Everybody knows that Ford makes some of the best trucks on the road, but the automaker still has a problem getting its car message across.\n\nHere it is: This company sells cars, really good cars, and anyone who thinks otherwise is living in the past.\n\nOver the past three years, Ford has rolled out a new stable full of up-to-date, highly competitive new car models that can compete with the best of the Japanese makes. And at the top of the list is the Ford Five Hundred sedan, introduced for 2005 as the first of two cars designed to replace the venerable Taurus.\n\nThe Five Hundred is offered in two trim levels and either front- or all-wheel drive, with 2007 prices ranging from $22,980 (plus $750 freight) for the base SEL front-wheel-drive version to $28,405 for the top-of-the-line Limited model with all-wheel drive.\n\nIn between are the SEL with all-wheel drive for $24,830 and the Limited with front drive for $26,555.\n\nThe Limited is the most impressive one, and has a long list of standard amenities – including leather interior – that fully justifies the price.\n\nThe Five Hundred is larger than the Taurus it replaces, but smaller than the venerable taxi/police favorite Crown Victoria.\n\nIt is part of Ford’s strategy to revitalize its car business after years of concentrating on trucks and sport utility vehicles.\n\nAfter the Taurus lost favor with consumers in the late ’90s, Ford – whether by accident or ill-conceived design — ceded its car business to the Japanese, losing out in the lucrative midsize sedan market to the likes of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nWith the Five Hundred, then the addition of the Fusion for 2006, Ford has finally said “Enough!” and mounted a serious attack on the Japanese automakers’ dominance of the car market.\n\nThe Five Hundred is part of a two-vehicle strategy that Ford says “brackets” the discontinued Taurus, giving sedan customers two strong products to choose from. The Five Hundred is on the upper end of the bracket in price as well as size. The Fusion, which is Ford’s entry midsize model, ranges from just over $17,000 to just under $24,000 (plus freight).\n\nBut where the Fusion leaves off, the Five Hundred begins, and it gives Ford not only a competitor to the Camry and Accord, but even to the Toyota Avalon, a larger version of the Camry that some observers have described as “the best Buick money can buy.”\n\nThis car is as upscale as Buick’s new LaCrosse, and a credible alternative to both the LaCrosse and Avalon, among others.\n\nThe Five Hundred is based on the architecture of Volvo’s flagship S80 sedan. Volvo, the Swedish automaker known for its safe cars, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe Five Hundred is for consumers who want something a bit more modern and upscale – not to mention larger – than the Taurus, yet not as large as the Crown Vic.\n\nAlthough the Five Hundred’s styling certainly can’t be described as radical or even cutting-edge, it does offer a refreshing new look in a Ford sedan.\n\nFord designers have avoided the stodgy looks of the Crown Vic and Taurus. And the Five Hundred isn’t nearly as bland as the generically styled Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nThe Five Hundred doesn’t have the stodgy handling of a Taurus or Crown Vic, either.\n\nThis is a Ford sedan that has decent styling, a comfortable ride, room for five full-size adults, yet surprisingly nimble handling.\n\nThe Five Hundred handles more like a sport sedan or coupe, quite surprising for a car whose back seat offers more passenger room than a new Rolls-Royce.\n\nAlthough a Limited model I drove came with a sticker that totaled more than $31,000 with options, it’s not necessary to pay that much to get a nicely equipped Five Hundred.\n\nThe least-expensive model last year was the SE, but that one has been discontinued for 2007, leaving the better-equipped SEL as the base model – with more standard equipment than last year’s SE, but with a price just a few hundred dollars more.\n\nEven at the base price, the Five Hundred comes with a long list of standard equipment, including “Command Seating” for the driver and front-seat passenger. That means the front seats are about four inches higher than those of a conventional sedan, giving the driver and front passenger a better view of the road.\n\nFord claims best-in-class rear headroom and legroom, plus the largest trunk of any sedan – a whopping 21.2 cubic feet of space.\n\nUnder the hood of all Five Hundreds is a 3.0-liter V-6 engine, connected to a six-speed automatic transmission on front-drive models, or a continuously-variable transmission on all-wheel-drive versions.\n\nThis engine is rated at 203 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque, which isn’t at the top of the class, but quite adequate for moving this car along with the rest of the traffic.\n\nFor 2007, Ford is adding front seat-mounted side air bags and a side-curtain canopy air bag system for both rows of seating as standard equipment.\n\nOther standard features include four-wheel antilock disc brakes; 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels with all-season tires; AM/FM stereo with single CD player; power door locks with remote keyless entry and door-mounted keyless entry key pad; power windows with driver’s door one-touch up/down; five-passenger seating with a six-way power driver’s seat with manual lumbar adjustment; bright painted grille; halogen headlamps; air-conditioning ducts in rear of front console; six-way power driver’s seat; two-way power front-passenger seat; split fold-flat rear bench seat; two 12-volt power points; automatic dimming rearview mirror; fold-flat front passenger seat; leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel with audio controls; message center with electronic compass; wood-grain appliqué on center stack and console; tilt steering wheel with cruise control; and Ford’s SecuriLock anti-theft system.\n\nThe upgrade to the Limited model brings 18-inch bright aluminum wheels; heated chrome exterior mirrors with puddle lamps; an Audiophile audio system with a six-CD changer and subwoofer; analog clock; dual electronic automatic climate control; eight-way power driver’s seat; heated driver and passenger seats with leather surfaces, four-way power passenger seat, and a memory for the driver’s seat and exterior mirrors The leather seats and seat heaters are offered as options on the SEL model.\n\nOther options include Sirius satellite radio; power-adjustable pedals; moon roof; navigation system; reverse sensing system; traction control; chrome mesh grille; a Limited convenience package; a chrome package; a safety package; a safety and security package; an interior power package; and an interior convenience package.\n\nNo manual gearbox is offered in either model.\n\nInside, there is 107.5 cubic feet of passenger space, which is huge – especially when you consider that the exterior of the car is almost the same size as most of the popular midsize sedans.\n\nThis is a case where Ford designers, using the Volvo platform, were able to optimize interior space without a correspondingly large increase in exterior dimensions.\n\nWith the rear seat folded (it’s a 60-40 split) and the front passenger seat also folded to increase cargo space, an eight-foot ladder can be carried inside the car with the trunk lid closed.\n\nSteering is a precise power rack-and-pinion setup, and the brakes also come with electronic brake-force distribution – standard on all models.\n\nBecause the Five Hundred’s chassis and body structure are borrowed from the S80, the car comes with the same crash-safety engineering features found on the Volvo, which have made that car one of the safest on the road.\n\nFuel economy ratings for front-drive models with the automatic are 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway, impressive for a car this large.\n\nAll-wheel-drive models with the continuously variable transmission are rated at 19 mpg city/26 highway.",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Five Hundred’s biggest problem is the Chrysler 300, a giant hit. I’m a fan, but I question if the Five Hundred isn’t the vehicle with staying power. In the end you want a car that doesn’t become dated, that you can live with every day.\n\nYou can bet that a few years ago in the design studios of Chrysler and Ford, the 300 was seen as a big risk and the Five Hundred was seen as a safe bet. Ironically, at this point in the American market, fielding a blandly styled vehicle is actually riskier than taking a stand. A J.D. Power and Associates report last year revealed that polarizing car designs sell better than those that evoke no strong emotion in either direction.\n\nPerhaps the Five Hundred’s assets will become apparent as furor over the 300 dies down. The Five Hundred is roughly as roomy inside as the 300 and roomier than the Ford Crown Victoria despite being smaller from bumper to bumper.\n\nExterior Specifications Compared\n\tChrysler 300\tFord Five Hundred\tFord Crown Victoria\nLength (in.)\t196.8\t200.7\t212.0\nWidth (in.)\t74.1\t74.5\t77.3\nHeight (in.)\t58.4\t60.1\t56.8\nWheelbase (in.)\t120.0\t112.9\t114.7\nCurb Weight (lbs.)\t3,700\t3,643\t4,057\nSteering Diameter (ft.)\t38.9\t40.0\t40.3\nManufacturer data\n\nThe Five Hundred has pleasant ride quality and competent handling. The car’s platform is derived from that of Volvo’s S80 sedan. Overall I’d say the Five Hundred’s ride is similar  perhaps softer than one finds in European cars but nowhere near the mush we’ve come to expect from American road barges. The steering improves upon the current S80’s numb, somewhat heavy steering.\n\nModels equipped with the optional all-wheel drive include automatic leveling that employs self-leveling rear shock absorbers, which are similar to air shocks but don’t require a compressor. When the rear end is loaded and sits too low, the shocks restore the correct level when they rebound after absorbing bumps in the road.\n\nHave you ever climbed into a subcompact car, something like the Chevrolet Aveo, and been surprised by how roomy it is inside? If so, imagine attaching an air hose to it and pumping it up a couple of size classes and you have the Five Hundred. The interior volume is far superior to the current Ford Crown Victoria, which makes up most of the police cruisers and taxicabs in the country. The Five Hundred provides a compromise between cars and sport utility vehicles by locating the front seat cushion 4 inches higher than that of the average midsize sedan. The height improves legroom in addition to the driver’s vantage point. The backseat legroom is heroic.\n\nFord has delivered on its promise of higher-quality interiors. Both the design and the materials quality in the Five Hundred are impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, our preferred resource, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, hasn’t crash-tested the Five Hundred at the time of this review. It scored a quadruple-five-star rating in the government tests, which are less reliable (learn why in the Guide to Interpreting Crash Tests). Side-impact and side curtain-type airbags are optional and include the Safety Canopy feature, whereby the curtains deploy in the event of a rollover.\n\nAs of its intro, the Five Hundred comes with one engine, the 3.0-liter Duratec V-6, which is rated as follows.\n\nEngine Specifications\n\tDuratec 3.0-liter V-6\nHorsepower\t203 @ 5,750 rpm\nTorque (lbs.-ft.)\t207 @ 4,500 rpm\nRequired Gasoline\tregular unleaded (87 octane)\nManufacturer data\n\nThe standard transmission is a continuously variable type in its first mass-market application. Ford also offers a conventional six-speed automatic on the front-wheel-drive versions of the SEL and Limited, the higher two trim levels. I drove the CVT-equipped all-wheel-drive Five Hundred SEL.\n\nClose behind consumers’ styling complaint is one about power. Some say the Five Hundred is underpowered, a term that is too carelessly thrown around. I’d categorize it as modestly powered. The CVT behaves differently than do conventional step-gear transmissions, with a slower launch as the CVT adjusts to maximize acceleration. Many conventional automatics introduce delays of their own in the form of hunting and/or kickdown lag  it just happens at a different time. For a new technology, the CVT is capable and has logged few complaints.\n\nAll the same, if I were to load up an all-wheel-drive model with people and cargo and then take to the hills, I suspect I’d find the power lacking as well. The Chrysler 300 with a 3.5-liter V-6 has more guts, and the 300C with its 5.7-liter V-8 is in another league. I’m often asked if Ford will offer a V-8 in the future. The company doesn’t discuss such plans, but I’ll be very, very surprised if a V-8 doesn’t come along within the next year or so.\n\nI think all-wheel drive is being overhyped and oversold these days  in part because rear-wheel drive better justifies it. In most urban and suburban areas that have decent snow removal, front-drive cars like the Five Hundred should be just fine, especially when equipped with standard traction control and ABS. That said, if you intend to resell your car in a region where four-wheel drive is valued (rightly or wrongly), you might be better off shelling out the extra cash now for the feature that the next buyer thinks he needs.\n\nUnfortunately, Ford doesn’t offer an electronic stability system at this time.\n\nIt’s not notable for a large car to have a large trunk, but the fact that the Five Hundred’s 21-cubic-foot trunk joins a commodious cabin in such a compact shell  that’s notable. Ford conservatively claims the Five Hundred’s trunk can hold eight full-size golf bags. Also of note is the split, folding backseat, a feature that remains rare in full-size cars. One drawback to the car’s front-drive layout is a towing capacity of 1,000 pounds. The Chrysler 300 can hack 2,000 pounds.\n\nLet the Five Hundred’s slow start work to your advantage: Ford has been offering zero-percent financing to some buyers, and factory-to-dealer incentives also have been available at times during the year. Check our Incentives before you buy.\n\nI believe that if the Five Hundred were more interesting looking, it would be a hit. Currently it’s a lot like a minivan: roomy and both space and fuel efficient, but not compelling to look at. It’s possible that, in time, this model will attract similar buyers  practical people who don’t feel their image is tied to their car.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Ford’s “Year of the Car” might not have set the automotive world on fire.\n\nBut close examination of the new cars that came out of the product blitz Chairman Bill Ford promised for 2005 shows that the nation’s No. 2 automaker can design and build cars with the best of them.\n\nLast year, we got three impressive new Ford cars: the all-new Mustang, which became a runaway best-seller; the Freestyle, a crossover SUV-sport wagon; and the full-size Five Hundred sedan, one of two vehicles Ford is using to replace the long-running Taurus sedan.\n\nFor this report, we tested the 2006 version of the Five Hundred Limited. This is the top-of-the-line model, whose price starts at $26,380 (plus $675 freight) but has a long list of standard amenities — including leather interior — that fully justifies the price.\n\nThe Five Hundred is larger than the Taurus it replaces, but smaller than the venerable taxi/police favorite Crown Victoria.\n\nIt part of Ford’s strategy to revitalize its car business after years of concentrating on trucks and sport utility vehicles.\n\nAfter the Taurus lost favor with consumers in the late ’90s, Ford — whether by accident or ill-conceived design — ceded its car business to the Japanese, losing out in the lucrative midsize sedan market to the likes of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nWith the Five Hundred last year, and the addition of the Fusion this year, Ford has finally said “Enough!” and mounted a serious attack on the Japanese automakers’ dominance of the car market.\n\nThe Five Hundred is part of a two-vehicle strategy that Ford says “brackets” the discontinued Taurus, giving sedan customers two strong products to choose from.\n\nThe Five Hundred is on the upper end of the bracket in price as well as size, with stickers beginning just over $22,000, compared with about $17,000 for the Fusion.\n\nBut where the Fusion leaves off, the Five Hundred begins, and it gives Ford not only a competitor to the Camry and Accord, but even to the all-new Toyota Avalon, a larger version of the Camry that some observers have described as “the best Buick money can buy.”\n\nThis car is as upscale as Buick’s new LaCrosse, and a credible alternative to both the LaCrosse and Avalon, among others.\n\nThe Five Hundred is based on the architecture of Volvo’s flagship S80 sedan. Volvo, the Swedish automaker known for its safe cars, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe Five Hundred is for consumers who want something a bit more modern and upscale — not to mention larger — than the Taurus, yet not as large as the Crown Vic.\n\nAlthough the Five Hundred’s styling certainly can’t be described as radical or even cutting-edge, it does offer a refreshing new look in a Ford sedan.\n\nFord designers have avoided the stodgy looks of the Crown Vic and Taurus. And the Five Hundred isn’t nearly as bland as the generically styled Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nThe Five Hundred doesn’t have the stodgy handling of a Taurus or Crown Vic, either.\n\nDriving our Limited model last week proved to be something of a treat.\n\nThis is a Ford sedan that has decent styling, a comfortable ride, room for five full-size adults, yet surprisingly nimble handling.\n\nThe Five Hundred handles more like a sport sedan or coupe, quite surprising for a car whose back seat offers more passenger room than a new Rolls-Royce.\n\nAlthough our test model represented the best of the Five Hundred line, and came with a sticker that totaled more than $31,000 with options, you really don’t have to pay that much to get a nicely equipped Five Hundred.\n\nThe least-expensive model is the SE, with a base price of just under $23,000 (including freight) for a front-wheel-drive model, while the all-wheel-drive version’s base price is about $24,500. That compares with a base price of just under $20,000 for the Taurus it repolaced, but it’s hard to compare these cars — the Five Hundred is just so far ahead.\n\nThe midlevel SEL version begins at just under $25,000.\n\nEven at the base price, the Five Hundred comes with a long list of standard equipment, including “Command Seating” for the driver and front-seat passenger. That means the front seats are about four inches higher than those of a conventional sedan, giving the driver and front passenger a better view of the road.\n\nFord claims best-in-class rear headroom and legroom, plus the largest trunk of any sedan — a whopping 21.2 cubic feet of space.\n\nUnder the hood of all Five Hundreds is a 3.0-liter V-6 engine, connected to a six-speed automatic transmission on most front-drive models, or a continuously-variable transmission on all-wheel-drive and some front-drive models.\n\nIt’s rated at 203 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque, which isn’t at the top of the class, but quite adequate for moving this car along with the rest of the traffic.\n\nStandard features, even at the base price, include four-wheel antilock disc brakes; 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels with all-season tires; AM/FM stereo with single CD player; power door locks with remote keyless entry and door-mounted keyless entry key pad; power windows with driver’s door one-touch up/down; and five-passenger seating with a six-way power driver’s seat with manual lumbar adjustment.\n\nThe upgrade to the SEL adds dual-zone automatic climate control, six-disc CD changer with MP3 capability, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a fold-flat front passenger seat with two-way power adjustment.\n\nExtras that come with the Limited, besides leather seats and quite attractive wood interior accents, include 18-inch wheels and Pirelli P6 tires, an audiophile sound system with subwoofer, and heated front sport seats.\n\nOptions offered on all models include all-wheel drive ($1,700) and side-curtain air bags with rollover protection ($595-$795, depending on model).\n\nIf you choose all-wheel drive, you’ll get the continuously variable automatic transmission, rather than the conventional six-speed. No manual gearbox is offered in either model, at least for now.\n\nInside, there is 107.5 cubic feet of passenger space, which is huge — especially when you consider that the exterior of the car is almost the same size as most of the popular midsize sedans.\n\nThis is a case where Ford designers, using the Volvo platform, were able to optimize interior space without a correspondingly large increase in exterior dimensions. With the rear seat folded (it’s a 60-40 split) and the front passenger seat also folded to increase cargo space, an eight-foot ladder can be carried inside the car with the trunk lid closed.\n\nSteering is a precise power rack-and-pinion setup, and the brakes also come with electronic brake-force distribution — standard on all models.\n\nOptions on our Limited model included some things we could have lived without and still had a very nice car. But they did help dress the vehicle up enough to make it feel more like a Lexus than a Ford.\n\nThey included an AM/FM/compact-disc/navigation system with moving map in the center dash console ($1,995); a reverse sensing system ($295); adjustable foot pedals with memory ($195); and a DVD rear-seat entertainment center ($995).\n\nWe also had the optional safety package ($595), which included driver and front-passenger seat-mounted side air bags, as well as side-curtain air bags for front and back seats.\n\nTotal sticker for our car, which came with front drive and the six-speed transmission, was $31,130, including freight.\n\nBecause the Five Hundred’s chassis and body structure are borrowed from the S80, the car comes with the same crash-safety engineering features found on the Volvo, which have made that car one of the safest on the road.\n\nFuel economy ratings for front-drive models with the automatic are 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway, impressive for a car this large.\n\nAll-wheel-drive models with the continuously variable transmission are rated at 19 mpg city/26 highway.\n\nThe tank holds 19 gallons of fuel, and unleaded regular is acceptable.\n\n– – –\n\nG.
