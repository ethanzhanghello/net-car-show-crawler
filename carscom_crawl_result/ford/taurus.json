      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEven though Ford launched its new Five Hundred sedan for 2005, the automaker’s midsize Taurus continues into the 2006 model year with a simplified lineup and a single V-6 choice. Four-door sedans are offered in SE and SEL trim levels. SEL models gained woodgrain trim on the console, doors and instrument panel for 2005. When properly equipped, sedans seat up to six occupants.\n\nFord has already dropped the Taurus wagon, and the sedan isn’t likely to last much longer. Mercury no longer offers its related Sable sedan but has instead turned to the new Milan model.\n\nExterior\nAerodynamic teardrop-shaped headlights and large taillights are the major styling cues on the four-door Taurus sedan, which rides on a 108.5-inch wheelbase and has 16-inch tires. At 197.6 inches long overall, the Taurus is approximately 8 inches longer than the Toyota Camry. Seven-spoke aluminum wheels are mounted on SEL models. A sunroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nIn SE form, the Taurus sedan can seat up to six people with a front bench seat and folding center storage console. Five occupants fit in the SEL sedan, which is equipped with front bucket seats. All four doors contain map pockets, and the trunk holds 17 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nStandard SE equipment includes air conditioning, remote keyless entry, cruise control, a cassette stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Moving up to the SEL model adds a driver’s door keypad, a six-way power driver’s seat, lighted visor mirrors, a HomeLink garage-door opener and a CD player. The SE sedan has a column-mounted gearshift, while the SEL has a floor lever. Options include leather seating surfaces and heated mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nOnly a single 3.0-liter V-6 is available for 2006:a Vulcan overhead-valve engine that produces 153 horsepower. The four-speed-automatic transmission incorporates adaptive shift control.\n\nSafety\nThe front airbags deploy at one of two inflation levels based on crash severity and whether or not the seat belts are buckled. Side-impact airbags, antilock brakes and traction control are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Taurus sedan is satisfying in most respects, but it doesn’t stand above the midsize pack, which includes the league-leading Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Ride and handling are acceptable, but the Taurus can feel a little ponderous at times; it can also exhibit a harsher-than-expected ride. The automatic transmission functions in an easygoing manner but may suffer a bit of hesitation when downshifting.\n\nInterior space is ample, but large roof pillars impair visibility. All the seats are comfortable and supportive. Despite a few drawbacks, attractive prices have made the Taurus a good buy against much of the competition. Now that the sedan is on its way out, it’s tough to recommend at any price.",

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK — The styling is governmental. It would fit nicely into any municipal, state or federal vehicle fleet.\n\nThat is our first impression of the 2008 Ford Taurus Limited AWD sedan, a full-size car designed to haul parents, children, police, perpetrators or politicians. Even with its bright, bold, three-bar grille, the new Taurus appears devastatingly official.\n\nThat isn’t a complaint. It is, instead, restrained praise. There is something to be admired about a car that automatically slows neighboring traffic because of a collective assumption by fellow motorists that they are in proximity to a traffic citation.\n\nThe Taurus sedan, available with all-wheel drive or front-wheel drive, gets respect. That is no small thing in an often unruly world.\n\nWe noticed as much on our drive to and around this hard-knock metropolis. People gave us space, or they gently pulled alongside the Taurus, looked into the front cabin and breathed sighs of relief when they saw a bespectacled, small, gray-haired man with a woman of eternally undetermined age.\n\nMy wife, Mary Anne, and I laughed. “There goes another one,” I’d say. “Yep,” she’d say. We’d chuckle.\n\nBut our humor was undermined by vanity. The styling and dimensions of the new Taurus — a car more conservatively designed and substantially larger than its mid-size predecessors of the 1980s and 1990s — made us feel old.\n\n“I feel like a senior citizen in this one,” said my spouse. “Did Ford design this one for seniors?”\n\nThe answer is “no” and “yes.”\n\nThe new, full-size Taurus follows the ill-named Ford Five Hundred, which enjoyed some fame among senior citizens but hardly anyone else. The Five Hundred was a good, solid, spacious sedan friendly to aging backs and bottoms, attributes shared by its successor. But, given its size and its weight approaching two tons, the Five Hundred largely was treated in the market as an underpowered lump.\n\nThe new Taurus shares many of its predecessor’s structural underpinnings. But it has a substantially stronger engine, a 263-horsepower V-6 as opposed to a 203-hpV-6 in the Five Hundred. Fit, finish and material quality are discernibly better in the new Taurus, too. Also, the Taurus has more intelligence — seriously.\n\nFord has installed its Microsoft-based, voice-activated Sync communications system in the Taurus. You can make phone calls, play music or contact emergency personnel simply by telling the car to do so. It would consume too much space here to explain Sync technology. Don’t worry. The system comes with an owner’s manual.\n\nWe developed affection for the Taurus Limited, which we nicknamed “Das Boot” after the 1981 movie depicting life and death on a German U-boat in World War II. Admittedly, sitting in the Taurus Limited on a long drive was nowhere near as harsh and, certainly, not even close to dangerous. But we were overwhelmed by the girth of the thing. We sometimes felt that we were piloting, more than driving the car, an assessment shared by our counterpart in these matters, Ria Manglapus.\n\n“It is so big,” Ria said. “Everything in this car is big. The front seats are so big, you feel like you can slide across them.”That is why, of course, it is good to wear seat belts, especially in cars as large as the Taurus Limited.\n\nBut we became accustomed to the car’s size and all of the living space it provided on the road. We could stretch out in this car. We could rest in it at rest stops.\n\nSoon, we expect Ford to build Taurus sedans with advanced diesel engines. Those cars would be about 35 percent more fuel efficient than current models. That development should ensure the long-term success of the born-again Taurus — a big car, comfortable and solidly built, certifiably safe, with enough power and utility to meet the transportation needs of a family, or a city, county, state or federal agency.",

      "expert_review": "Pity the folks who don’t understand how much cars and people are alike. You have to get to know them [cars and people] before making a commitment. Otherwise, the relationship can be short and unhappy.\n\nSome cars, and people, come on strong. They look like a million bucks. But spend some time with them, and you know they’re not for you. Lots of style, maybe not so much substance. The whole package doesn’t back up the looks or performance that first attracted you.\n\nThen there are the cars, like people, you tend to overlook. Until you realize they’ve been around you for years, getting the job done, even though they hardly shout at you or stand out from the streams of vehicles passing by on the highway.\n\nBut spend some time with one of them and you come away impressed. There’s real substance behind that “normal” exterior.\n\nThis is about one of the latter: The 2001 Ford Taurus Wagon. Even though the 2002s are coming out, the changes will be of the tweaking and improving category. The redesign took place a year ago.\n\nMrs. G., never a fan of wagons and SUVs, gives this one her highest rating: “It’s a nice car … for a wagon.”\n\nAnd she’s right. It’s a nice car – er, wagon. You don’t ooh and ahh over it, but it goes about its business, does what a wagon is supposed to do and, hidden behind that facade is a double five-star safety rating for both driver and passenger.\n\nFamily histories can get confusing, so let’s just deal with the last three generations of Taurus (and its sibling, the Mercury Sable). The first generation was the squarish design that made Taurus a best-seller in the early 1990s. The second generation was the oval design that didn’t win Ford many friends – earning only grudging acceptance by the time it was due to be phased out.\n\nThis is a third generation. It keeps some of the oval designs (door openings, windows, and grille) but squares off the whole car. It works. There’s plenty of room inside and the tailgate lifts for wide access to the rear storage area.\n\nBut there’s one leftover drawback from the oval design: Anyone bigger than a small child tends to whack their head when getting into the rear seat.\n\nAmong the four folks bonking their heads in a weekend of ferrying people and shopping was my daughter, hardly a giant at 5 feet, 4 inches.\n\nThis model of the Taurus was the SES, meaning it was a tad more expensive and had accoutrements such as leather seats, six-disc CD changer (with the unit mounted behind the wheel well in the rear cargo area), ABS, and traction control.\n\nThe 200-horsepower, 3.0-liter V6 was up to the task of people moving. The Taurus wagons always have had a different rear suspension from the sedan models. This one’s short- and long-arm rear setup, in this corner’s opinion, continues a tradition in which the wagons handle better than the sedans.\n\nSafety-wise, the Taurus is a big winner. That five-star front-seat driver and passenger safe ty rating is prized by Ford engineers, marketers, and customers alike. The dual-stage front air bags deploy with less force [although just as quickly] in lesser fontal collisions. Ford’s safety system also includes a crash-severity sensor, driver’s seat position sensor and front seat belt usage sensors. Those factors add up to those stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing. Our wagon also had side impact air bags (a $390 option).\n\nDriving on the highway, in the land of 18-wheelers and SUVs, we felt safe.\n\nMeasurements for headroom and hiproom always confuse me. But we put four good-sized people in the car, let the driver (me) have the seat all the way back, and everyone professed to be comfortable for a long trip. On a furniture-shopping excursion to Central Massachusetts last Saturday, the Taurus did just fine, even though we didn’t try to carry home any big pieces (the adjustable roof rak isnt designed for sofas and tables).\n\nInside, ther were sufficient storage cubbies and cupholders. The audio and climate controls were standard Ford, with good-sized buttons, and were pretty much intuitive.\n\nWhen you test drive a car, the law of averages says it generally arrives in a color you wouldn’t choose. But this Taurus had Ford’s new-for-2001 Spruce Green clear coat metallic. It’s a color that always seems to look nice, dirty or not. The Taurus and Sable design with the slight horizontal bulges at doorhandle height picks up a bit of road reflection. I’ve always thought it adds a nice two-tone appearance to the vehicles.\n\nIt’s the midsize cars like the Taurus, Camry, Accord, Impala, Intrepid, and Legacy that most people buy.\n\nTaurus is a big member of that group. It’s worth that second look because there’s a lot more there than you see at first glance.\n\n2001 Ford Taurus Wagon\n\nBase price: $20,285\n\nPrice as tested: $25,145\n\nHorsepower: 200\n\nTorque: 200 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 108.5 inches\n\nOverall length: 197.7 inches\n\nWidth: 73 inches\n\nHeight: 57.8 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,516 lbs.\n\nSeating: 5 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 23.6 miles per gallon\n\nSOURCE: Ford Motor Co.; fuel economy from Globe testing.",

      "expert_review": "When Ford took the wraps off of its 2000 Taurus last spring at the New York Auto Show, enhanced safety and a fairly major redesign were key elements.\n\nThe 2000 Taurus (as well as the mechanically similar 2000 Sable) is now on the street and I have had a chance to drive both. It comes in LX, SE and SE station wagon models. Prices start as low as $18,245 for the LX and range to $$21,445 for the SE Comfort model.\n\nAcross the board, from drivability to styling to function, this Taurus is a notable improvement. It has a little more headroom in front but 1.9 inches more in back. The trunk is 1.2 cubic feet bigger and it is easier to get things in and out. It now contains an emergency release so it can be opened from inside.\n\nAs before, the availability of a station wagon is great because so few are offered in this mid-size class.\n\nOur test car, an SE model with the Duratec 24-valve, DOHC, 3.0-liter V6 engine, has 200 horsepower, an increase of 15. The base engine, also a 3.0-liter V6, gets an increase of eight horsepower to 153.\n\nThe Duratec engine is clearly superior to the older engine. It is more energetic and refined, although in terms of overall smoothness it still falls a tad short of some of the best engines in this segment.\n\nNice additions include the availability of an all-speed traction control system ($175). Anti-lock brakes are optional on the LX and standard on the SE.\n\nTo improve the ride and handling, Ford retuned the suspension and changed the front-end alignment for added directional stability. Handling seems to be about as before, while ride harshness has been reduced.\n\nDespite changes to improve steering feel, I think the Taurus, as well as the Sable, doesn’t steer as nicely as the smaller Focus.\n\nIn terms of the redesign, the roof and door panels remain the same, but the nose is more upright and less round. Large, clear-glass headlights and a bigger grille give the front a stronger presence, while around back the trunk is taller, the taillights are bigger and the back window is rectangular.\n\nInside, things have been changed significantly, as well. The instrument panel and the integrated control panel for radio and climate control are no longer dominated by oval shapes.\n\nBig map pockets are again in the door panels. An adjustable cupholder has been created for the center console. Even when it is not being used as a cupholder, its rectangular shape makes it a good storage space for cell phones, etc.\n\nWhile the most obvious part of the story is the redesign, the comprehensive way that safety has been addressed is significant. The previous Taurus had received a five star ranking in crash tests, and the steps the company has taken to improve on that score is noteworthy.\n\nFortunately, during my test drive I did not have a chance to test the new system, but it contains a number of features that give it a considerable advantage.\n\nFor example, the “brain” o f the safety system is a computer with sensors that tell it whether the front-seat passengers are wearing seatbelts, how close the driver’s seat is to the steering wheel and how severe the accident is. Dual-stage airbags open at two levels of force, depending on the severity of the accident.\n\nFord’s press material explains that in a crash, the computer activates devices in the seatbelt retractors that take the slack out of the belts. In severe crashes, a metal bar tucked into the spool of the seatbelt retractor releases small amounts of belt webbing to reduce the risk of injuries to the occupant’s chest.\n\nOptional side airbags are shaped to protect both the head and chest in a side impact.\n\nFor those who use child safety seats, there are three anchors for attaching tethers to keep the seats in place even better.\n\nFord said it expects this new safety system to reduce airbag deployments and cut down on airbag-related injuries.\n\nWorking hand-in-hand with the ew safety system is an adjustable pedal option ($120). The pedals can be moved up to three inches so that shorter drivers need not have the steering wheel in their face in order to reach the pedals.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $21,445. Options included floor mats, center console, traction control, adjustable pedals, side-impact airbags and leather upholstery.\n\nThe sticker price was $23,185.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The 2000 Taurus has greater appeal because it looks better, drives better and has an impressive gathering of standard safety equipment, all for a price that is well under $19,000 for the LX.\n\nCounterpoint: While changes have been made to the steering, I think it still feels artificially heavy.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.0-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nCONFIGURATION: front-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 108.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,341 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $21,445\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $23,185\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 28 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2014 Ford Taurus. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nLike a prehistoric animal living blissfully without influence from the rest of the world, the 2014 Ford Taurus has had evolutionary blinders on; it simply hasn’t changed quickly enough to stay competitive in this class.\n\nIn fact, the Taurus might just get eaten alive by the more modern and advanced Hyundai Azera, Chevrolet Impala, and Chrysler 300S. See them compared side by side here. We tested these sedans and a few others in Cars.com’s $38,000 Full-Size Sedan Challenge.\n\nThe Taurus’ possible saving grace, however, is as a family pack mule, with a backseat that can fit three kids or three child-safety seats across, plus trunk space to schlep even the most challengingly large family loads.\n\nThe Taurus hasn’t changed notably for the new model year. The only slight change is the addition of an available lane-keeping system in Limited and SHO trim levels. See the 2013 and 2014 models compared side by side here.\n\nThe 2014 Taurus has four trims to choose from: the front-wheel-drive SE, the front- or all-wheel-drive SEL and Limited, and the all-wheel-drive SHO, all of which are powered by a high-performance, twin-turbo V-6 engine. The SE can also be had with a four-cylinder. See the trims compared side by side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Taurus’ front grille looks a little like the wide, gaping mouth of a whale shark. It does get a little better from there, however, with additional bits of chrome jewelry on the exhaust tips and solid, grounded-looking 19-inch wheels on the Limited version I drove. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard on the base SE trim.\n\nThe Taurus comes in a range of 10 available exterior colors with body-colored door handles. While all the basics are there, there are also a few unique color options for the more adventurous ones among us, like Kodiak Brown Metallic and Sunset Metallic (a sparkling burnt orange color), so we can express ourselves.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nAs a family workhorse, this full-size sedan has the ability to haul even full-size families with full-size cargo needs. All three positions of the rear seat are quite comfortable (I know — I tried them out myself over many miles). A low floor hump below the center passenger’s feet and a bench that’s almost as soft and comfortable there as in the outboard positions makes the center seat just as usable as the others. This may sound like a minor thing, but sitting in the center rear seat in every vehicle in our recent Full-Size Sedan Challenge has given me newfound sympathy for my youngest daughter, who often gets squeezed into that rock-hard and sometimes raised middle seat.\n\nThe 20.1 cubic feet of trunk space in the Taurus was the most voluminous in our Challenge thanks to the Taurus’ recessed floor. It allowed a shocking 10 golf bags to be piled in. Hockey sticks, backpacks, sleeping bags and Costco runs can all be swallowed without so much as a burp from the Taurus. This feels massive compared with the Chrysler 300’s 16.3 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nThe Taurus’ functionality and backseat are overshadowed, however, by the antiquated and messy aesthetics of the front of the cabin. An abundance of black plastic surfaces gives this brand-new vehicle the look of a gently used rental car. I loved having three cupholders in the center area between the driver and passenger, as I regularly have both a latte and a bottle of water during my morning run; having that third cupholder meant my husband could also store his coffee. However, the cupholders have hinged lids that have to be flipped open to use the cupholders. This created a cluttered look, with sharp, squared-off corners and edges sticking up this way and that. I’d much rather have cupholders that are always open for easy access — and that are trimmed out more elegantly, like those in the Toyota Avalon.\n\nWhile Ford and Microsoft have theoretically improved the MyFord Touch system, there’s still a general lag in touch-response time, not to mention the cluttered and confusing interface that’s impossible to interact with without removing your eyes from the road. If my $200 iPhone can react instantaneously when I touch it, a $35,000 car with touch-screen technology should be at least as quick and easy to use. One of my biggest pet peeves with this system is the presence of four main navigation “buttons” in the corners of the screen that are too narrow for a normal-size finger to touch.\n\nTall drivers with longer legs may also complain about the wide center console cutting into their knee room. The consumer who test-drove all the cars in our Challenge had to press his knee and leg up against the side of the console for the entire drive in order to properly reach the accelerator. He commented on how uncomfortable this would be for long drives.\n\nIf you can get around this issue, buyers of the Taurus Limited will fawn over the heated and ventilated front seats, which are standard on that trim level.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nUnfortunately, the Taurus just didn’t live up to the high driving standard set in our Challenge. When accelerating, there was quite a lag before the Limited’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine’s power really kicked in. It took more nursing than I would like to get smooth acceleration up to speed from a full stop.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Taurus gets an EPA-estimated 19/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined with the V-6, which puts it in the middle of the similarly equipped sedans in our Challenge. The 300S, Dodge Charger SXT Plus and Azera (all 2013 models) are all rated 23 mpg combined. The 2014 Impala and 2013 Nissan Maxima are rated 22 mpg, and the 2013 Avalon leads with an estimated 25 mpg combined.\n\nThe Taurus suffered a lot of lean in corners, which I noticed both as a driver and as a backseat passenger. In the back, I was thrown around on a twist and then a turn while the driver got up to speed approaching a highway on-ramp. From the center rear seating position, I had to grab the handles on either side of the car to catch myself and stay upright. This lack of support isn’t just in the rear seat, but can also be sensed by the driver as a feeling of apprehension when cornering, plus an innate desire to brake midway through a corner just to gain a sense of sure footing. The brakes were a bit touchy, which I felt equally as a passenger.\n\nThe Taurus’ suspension did recover easily from a large recessed bump in the highway while at speed, where several of the other cars in our Challenge bounced a few times before finally settling down.\n\nCabin noise inside the Taurus was quite obtrusive, even on smoother roads. I had to raise my voice to be heard from the backseat, and the notes I dictated to my iPhone while in the Taurus were illegible. You might be quick to blame this on Siri’s lack of voice-recognition skills, but I could easily decipher all my notes taken in other cars in our Challenge, which covered the same roads at the same speeds. The ones taken in the Taurus were about as understandable as hieroglyphics: “Very fast can come are the toilet seat” and “Wakefield Moshi comparing to the other.” (If you have any idea what those might mean, please email me.)\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2014 Taurus received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 2013 Taurus earned the institute’s Top Safety Pick designation, which represents top scores in all tests except the new small-overlap crash test, to which no car in this class has been subjected. Because the Taurus is mechanically unchanged for 2014, the results should apply to the new model year.\n\nAs has been required since the 2012 model year, the 2014 Taurus has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The Taurus also features six standard airbags, including driver and passenger front airbags, driver and passenger torso side airbags, and side curtain airbags extending to cover both rows. While this may seem good enough, again this feels like an area in which Ford has the expertise to expand and evolve; competing cars in the segment offer up to 10 standard airbags.\n\nA Belt Minder system that alerts the driver if any of the front or rear occupied seats have an unbuckled seat belt is standard on all trim levels, as is a tire pressure monitor. A rearview camera is standard on Limited and SHO trims and optional on the SEL. A blind spot monitoring system with cross-traffic alert is optional on both the Taurus Limited and SHO, as is a lane-keep assist system.\n\nThe wide backseat in the Taurus makes it one of the few sedans we’ve tested than can fit three child-safety seats side by side, in certain configurations. The Taurus’ Latch anchor configuration is a little different from most vehicles. While most cars have two sets of Latch anchors (one set in each of the outboard seats), they typically don’t allow a center seat to be installed via Latch by using an anchor from either side. The Taurus’ anchors are different. They’re slightly offset, but built to allow for attachment to either the center position or the outer positions, but not both at the same time. This allows for greater flexibility for a growing family with one or two child-safety seats to install with the Latch anchors. However, three cannot be used with Latch at the same time. Learn more in the 2014 Taurus Car Seat Check.\n\nThe downside to this configuration lies in a family situation like my own. My two youngest daughters (ages 8 and 10) are still in booster seats, and we use Latch to attach their Clek Olli seats. One of the Taurus’ Latch anchors is directly behind a seat belt buckle. So, if two Latch-connected boosters were installed in the outer two positions, the left seat would sit directly on top of two sets of belt buckles, effectively blocking both the left and center positions from being able to buckle their belts.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nTAURUS IN THE MARKET\n“Taurus” is one of those nameplates that has simply been around forever. I remember my parents renting a Taurus on vacation when I was a young child, and I thought it was the coolest, most comfortable car ever. While the current Taurus’ backseat is still quite plush and comfortable, nearly everything else about the car is due for an overhaul. Let’s hope that overhaul comes sooner rather than later. Otherwise this iconic name may get left in the dust in favor of its more progressively evolving competitors.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Amid complaints that you could buy a Taurus in any color, but not cheaply, Ford brought out a price leader Taurus G sedan for 1996 that’s carried into 1997 with one change, a new blue denim exterior color. The prices stays at $18,545, which includes $550 for freight.\n\nThe G keeps it simple with black rather than body-colored side moldings, rocker panels and mirrors. There’s also no power locks and no chance to buy the 3-liter, 200-h.p., Duratec V-6.\n\nYou have to settle for locks that function one door at a time when you press the button or insert key. You really don’t appreciate power locks until you do without, especially in a midsize sedan that takes more effort to get toeach button than it does in a little subcompact Escort. Women who travel aloneand parents who travel with kids demand power locks.\n\nAnother irritant is that you can get only the 3-liter, 145-h.p., Vulcan V-6, not the peppier Duratec V-6. The Vulcan V-6 means the trip down the merger ramp or up the incline must be taken more cautiously.\n\nThe Vulcan V-6 is for the older or less aggressive driver content to move from place to place without burning too much fuel (20 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway).\n\nDual air bags are standard, ABS a $570 option. With an AM/FM stereo with cassette at $175, you reach $19,290.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2007 about the 2008 Ford Taurus. This year, Ford made the Taurus’ electronic stability system standard, which enhances its safety appeal significantly. To see what else is new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nEven if you’ve never owned a Taurus, you probably know someone who has. Before the demise of the original Taurus, it was Ford’s bread-and-butter family car and had a prominent spot in driveways across America — a degree of popularity the carmaker hopes to regain, at least in part, with the new Taurus. It’s a revision of the slow-selling Five Hundred, a practical car that suffered from unimaginative styling and modest performance.\n\nThe five-seat Taurus keeps the Five Hundred’s better attributes and reverses many of its faults, and it deserves to be a hit. Whether or not it will be depends on how consumers react to its cabin and styling. Both have improved, but neither is as compelling as some competitors.\n\nThe Basics\nThe Taurus comes with either front- or all-wheel drive. Ford also sells the Taurus X, a six- or seven-seat wagon derived from the Taurus. Mercury’s Sable sedan is the Taurus’ twin.\n\nTrim levels for the Taurus include a base SEL and uplevel Limited. Both share the same V-6 engine, and an automatic transmission is standard. I drove an all-wheel-drive Taurus Limited.\n\nEdgier Styling\nFord says there are some 500 updates to the Taurus compared to the Five Hundred, and they start up front. A new three-bar grille replaces the Five Hundred’s forgettable mesh one. The headlights and fog lights look crisper and less restrained than before, and the overall effect recalls Ford’s smaller sedans, the Fusion and redesigned Focus. Those who think they’re getting an upsized Fusion might be disappointed to see the Taurus in the flesh; with the same wheelbase and virtually unchanged dimensions, it keeps the Five Hundred’s stodgy profile.\n\nThe taillights now have clear lenses, something a lot of automakers resort to when they need to spice things up. I parked beside a Five Hundred, and its simpler red taillights seemed more fitting for a large family car.\n\nSeventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the SEL. Eighteen-inch wheels are optional on the SEL and standard on the Limited.\n\nHow it Moves\nWith its upsized V-6 engine (the 3.5-liter Duratec gets 263 horsepower, up from last year’s 203), the Taurus moves smartly from stoplights and pulls confidently onto the freeway. Passing others requires just a modest step on the gas, and at 75 mph the car feels like it still has plenty of oomph left. The extra power doesn’t turn the Taurus into a lean machine, mind you — my all-wheel-drive test car, which weighed in at nearly two tons, felt hefty at all times. It moves quickly when needed, though, something the Five Hundred never did. Stick with front-wheel drive, and you shave off 189 pounds (about 5 percent of the car’s total weight), which is likely to create a payoff in sprightlier acceleration.\n\nMost of the time, the transmission minds its business without creating too much drama. Occasionally it goes beyond the call of duty, finding the right gear in a pinch and sticking with it for strong acceleration down a straightaway. Other times it comes up short — prod the gas pedal from a stoplight, and the gear changes are jerky and awfully late.\n\nUsing the EPA’s stricter 2008 standards, gas mileage is rated at 18/28 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 17/24 mpg with all-wheel drive. My mileage ranged from the mid-teens around urban Chicago to 26 mpg during one 30-minute freeway trip. The ratings represent a slight improvement over the Five Hundred’s when the 2007 numbers are adjusted to compensate for the new testing procedure. Here’s how they compare to the competition:\n\nGas Mileage Compared\n \tGas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\tRecommended fuel\nToyota Avalon\t19/28\tRegular\nNissan Maxima\t19/25\tPremium\nFord Taurus\t17/24 — 18/28\tRegular\nHyundai Azera\t17/26 — 18/26\tRegular\nChevrolet Impala\t16/24 — 18/29\tRegular (V-6) or premium (V-8)\nChrysler 300, 300C\t15/22 — 18/26*\tRegular (2.7L V-6) or midgrade (3.5L V-6; V-8)\nBuick Lucerne\t15/22 — 16/25\tRegular (V-6) or premium (V-8)\n*Excludes SRT8\nSource: EPA; all figures adjusted for 2008 standards.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The mushy pedal feel is typical for a large car.\n\nThe four-wheel-independent suspension combines a comfortable ride with unexpectedly agile handling. It sorts through potholes and expansion joints with little disturbance, and save for some wind noise off the A-pillar, the cabin stays relatively quiet on the highway. Hit some rough patches and there’s little of the floaty steering response you might expect from a full-size car. The wheels stay grounded, and the steering wheel turns with precision.\n\nBody roll is noticeable, but the suspension firms itself up through any prolonged turns and stays reasonably level. The Buick Lucerne delivers something of the same unexpected cornering response, but generally speaking these dynamics are rare in large family cars.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Taurus keeps the Five Hundred’s interior, save for a few bits and pieces. Those who fancy a premium environment or imaginative design would do better in a Lucerne or Avalon, but for anyone who wants straightforward simplicity, the Taurus is right up there. The front seats sit high off the ground — Ford calls it Command Seating — which affords a high driving position and makes getting in and out of the Taurus a breeze. The eight-way power seat in my test car offered plenty of adjustment range for short or tall drivers. The seats themselves felt well-padded, if a bit narrow.\n\nThe dashboard doesn’t break any new ground in design or quality, but its usability deserves note. Buttons for the driver’s memory settings, trunk release and power-adjustable pedals sit within easy view to the left of the steering wheel rather than being tucked in the footwell, as in many cars. The gauges have large numbers that are easy to read, and the green and red nighttime illumination is vintage Ford. The dual-zone climate controls won’t win any style awards, but the large temperature buttons are easy to find, and their tailored quality rivals those of any luxury car.\n\nNot that the Taurus passes for luxury: The center armrest is hard enough to dribble a basketball on, and the navigation system looks a few years behind in graphics quality. The overhead grab handles still slam against the ceiling when you let go — something most automakers addressed years ago with soft-shut handles. None of these issues are deal-breakers, but on the scale of user-friendliness, they keep the Taurus a few rungs below perfection.\n\nVisibility is excellent, unhindered by swooping rooflines or chunky C-pillars. The side windows are tall, and the outside rearview mirrors could fit an SUV. I never wondered if I had missed something with my over-the-shoulder glances. Cars like the Nissan Maxima and Chrysler 300 seem downright claustrophobic in comparison.\n\nThe rear seat offers spacious accommodations, though the backrest was angled a bit far for my taste. The center floor hump is manageably low — unexpected, considering my test car had all-wheel drive. The trunk measures 21.2 cubic feet, easily the largest in its class. Should you need it (if you just bought, I don’t know, an armoire) the rear seats fold in a 60/40 split, a feature some competitors skip. The Taurus is the only one to offer a fold-flat front passenger seat; with it down, Ford says the car accommodates cargo up to 9 feet long. The setup would be perfect if it weren’t for the low backseat opening and the abrupt step from the trunk floor to the folded seatback. Many cars provide some sort of bridge between the two surfaces, even if it’s just a flap that extends from the seatback. Not here.\n\nSafety\nAs safety ratings go, the Taurus is a solid bet. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the car its highest rating, Good, for all three of its crash tests — front-impact, side-impact and rear-impact. Not surprisingly, IIHS named the Taurus a Top Safety Pick among large cars.\n\nThe six standard airbags include side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. The curtain airbags include a tip sensor to maintain inflation for several seconds if the Taurus rolls over. This feature is normally reserved for SUVs, which are more prone to rollovers, but it’s nice to have all the same. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and traction control are also standard. An electronic stability system is optional.\n\nFour of the five seats have head restraints, and the Latch child-seat anchors for the outboard seats are spaced a few inches inward of the door. That locates properly installed seats farther away from potential side-impacts, and the inboard anchors are close enough to easily secure a seat in the center position — the safest spot for kids. Top-tether anchors for all three backseat positions are located on the shelf behind the seatback.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nExcluding the destination charge, the SEL starts at $23,245. Standard features include alloy wheels, power windows and locks, keyless entry, a power driver’s seat and a CD stereo with an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. The $27,230 Taurus Limited adds larger wheels, heated leather upholstery, a power passenger seat, automatic climate control and an upgraded stereo. Most of those features are optional on the SEL. For either trim level, all-wheel drive adds $1,850. Later this year, Microsoft’s Sync system, which integrates cell phones, iPods and more, will be available. Other options include a moonroof, backseat DVD player, navigation system and rear parking sensors.\n\nA fully loaded Limited AWD costs around $35,000 — still a bargain when you consider that the Avalon and V-6 Lucerne can run near $37,000 and the V-6 300 can easily top $40,000.\n\nTaurus in the Market\nThe Taurus’ everyday usability and safety credentials deserve attention, and if the Five Hundred is any indication, reliability should be respectable, as Fords go. Best of all, the car is seriously cheap — it even starts below bargain-priced Korean models like the Hyundai Azera and Kia Amanti.\n\nCombine that with its cargo dimensions and available all-wheel drive, and the Taurus seems destined to be a solid, if unemotional, choice. It might not achieve the everyman popularity of the original Taurus — or its modern-day successor, the Toyota Camry — but with this update, Ford should be able to take home a decent portion of the large-car market.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "In 1995, Ford officials told me that the shape of the new Taurus would grow on me over time.\n\nWell, two years down the road has proved Ford correct. I dislike the Taurus’ design quite a bit less than I did.\n\nPerhaps all the Taurus really needs is a redesign of the rear end, some nicer-looking taillights and a more cleanly designed trunk lid. In any case, I almost like it. The avant-garde styling is starting to look familiar.\n\nEven though some people still consider the shape of the Taurus to be controversial, few would argue that Ford engineers smacked a solid hit with the car’s performance, handling and quality.\n\nTechnically, this is an excellent car. And it’s hard not to like a car as well-made as the Taurus.\n\nI tested the SHO version, which has a high-performance engine, suspension system and brakes. It is designed for those who would like a BMW-like sports sedan but don’t have $45,000 or so to spend.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Taurus SHO is powered by a3.4-liter, double-overhead cam V-8 engine that has four valves per cylinder. The lightweight engine, which is made of aluminum, develops 235 horsepower.\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available. The previous generation SHO could be ordered with a five-speed stick shift, but only about 5 percent of SHO buyers ordered the manual transmission, so Ford dropped it from the option list when the new SHO came out last year.\n\nBy the way, this SHO is the first Taurus to be powered by a V-8, and it’s the only Ford vehicle to use the 3.4-liter engine.\n\nPerformance is excellent at all speeds. The SHO is fast from a stop, and it delivers plenty of punch all the way to the red line on the tachometer. The smooth-running engine makes a serious snarl as it revs, underscoring the performance nature of the car and giving it plenty of character.\n\nThe original V-6-powered SHO attracted a cult following for its wonderful high-performance engine and sensible design. The new model takes the SHO to the next level. This is a serious performance sports sedan. Motor Trend tested an SHO recently and clocked a 0-to-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds.\n\nThe SHO has just one American-made competitor, the new Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. Chrysler doesn’t really offer a true high-performance sports sedan, and neither do any of the Japanese automakers who build cars here.\n\nMotor Trend also tested a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP, which has five more horsepower, costs $5,000 less and races from 0 to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds. So the SHO takes a back seat to the Pontiac is several areas.\n\nThough the SHO’s acceleration is strong, it does not have the same finesse as the Grand Prix GTP, the best car I tested last year.\n\nUnder full acceleration from a stop, you can feel what engineers call torque steer, a slight pull to the left or right. You won’t feel it unless you hammer the accelerator from a dead stop. It’s not dangerous, but it gives th e SHO a slightly unrefined feeling.\n\nHowever, there is nothing else about the car’s handling performance that is less than excellent.\n\nThe powerful four-wheel disc brakes are fabulous. They have a strong confidence-inspiring feel, and the anti-lock system is smooth and quiet. I also like the firm, speed-sensitive power rack-and-pinion steering system. When you turn the wheel, the SHO responds instantly.\n\nFord engineers did a superb job tuning the SHO’s four-wheel independent suspension. The car is extremely quiet. When you are driving over the roughest brick roads, you hear only the sound of the tires. The stiff body allows the suspension to absorb the energy from bumps without transmitting much of the ruckus to the interior.\n\nOverall, the SHO got 15 miles per gallon in combined city/highway driving. This is far below EPA estimates. But I drove the car with a heavy foot, and the car wasn’t broken in (it had only 218 miles on the odometer when it was delivered.)O ce a car gets to 2,000 miles or so, the parts loosen up abit and the mileage improves.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIn many ways the new Taurus is a world-class automobile.\n\nThe solid way the doors close makes you think that Ford sculpted the SHO from a single block of steel.\n\nFord’s interior decorators really sweated the details, making sure all the various trim pieces look good and fit right. The analog instruments, featuring white numbers on a black background, were easy to read and well laid out.\n\nThe controversial part of the interior is the integrated control panel, or ICP, in the center of the dash. Within the oval area, Ford has placed all the buttons for the air conditioner, defroster and radio. This gives the Taurus a very futuristic look. Unfortunately, form does not follow function very well. Many of the buttons are the same size and shape, so changing the settings can be somewhat distracting. However, after a few days, I learned where each button was located.\n\nThe sumptuous tan leather seats didn’t take any getting used to at all. I liked them immediately. The front bucket seats were very comfortable and extremely supportive of my lower back and thighs. I made several two-hour trips and felt no fatigue.\n\nRearpassengerswill find plenty of head, leg and foot room. The rear seats split and fold forward, which is somewhat unusual for a mid-size car. There is plenty of room to transport long objects.\n\nMy major gripe with the SHO is its price – $30,000 is a lot of money for a Ford Taurus, even if it has a high-performance motor and all the bells and whistles of an import.\n\nEven though our test car came fully loaded, including such things as a six-disc CD player, an electric sunroof and a full array of power accessories, I feel as if Ford has placed too high a price on the SHO for it to sell in large numbers.\n\nHaving tested both true mid-size American sports sedans, I feel that the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP is much better looking and that it has the edge on the Taurus SHO when it comes to value for the dollar. With the Grand Prix you pay less and get more than you do with the SHO.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1997 Ford Taurus SHO Base price: $26,640. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection, daytime running lights, front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $30,380. EPA rating: 17 mpg city/26 mpg highway. Incentives: $1,000.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Taurus SHO is quick, comfortable, well-equipped and tightly assembled. It handles well and is a pleasure to drive. However, it may be priced too high.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford Taurus?\n\nThe Taurus is Ford’s five-seat full-size sedan. It’s powered by a standard 288-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available, and competitors include the Chevrolet Impala, Toyota Avalon and Kia Cadenza. Ford also offers a performance-oriented Taurus SHO that’s powered by a 365-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford Taurus?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford Taurus Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include cruise control, cloth seats, a CD stereo and a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Available features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote start, the Sync 3 touchscreen multimedia system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, navigation, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, power-adjustable pedals, adaptive cruise control and a power moonroof.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford Taurus?\n\nThe Taurus is nearing the end of the line in Ford’s lineup; the automaker has announced it won’t be sold in the U.S. when this generation ends its run. A large trunk and decent dynamics have been highlights, but the Taurus’ cabin isn’t as roomy as many competitors’ and the car doesn’t offer great visibility.",

      "expert_review": "The SHO version of Ford’s full-size Taurus sedan tries hard to do a lot of things, but it doesn’t excel at any of them.\n\nIt wants to be a performance car, but comes up short in a few critical areas. It could be a family car, thanks to its large exterior, but it’s too cramped inside. It’s comfortable cruising down the highway, but it’s a pain on narrow city streets.\n\nThe SHO is the high-performance model, but there are several versions of the Taurus on the road. The models are, in ascending price order, SE, SEL, Limited and SHO. The SHO is available only with AWD, and the SE is available only with front-wheel drive, but the other trims can be had with either front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nWe tested a 2011 Taurus SHO. Not much has changed between the 2010 and 2011, but judge for yourself here.\n\nAs a Performance Car\nThe best part of the SHO is its drivetrain. It comes with a 365-horsepower, turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that Ford calls an EcoBoost engine. It’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The engine and transmission are well-matched, so you get good power pulling away from the line and while passing.\n\nSome turbocharged engines have a lag before they start making acceleration power, and this can mean the engine first feels like it isn’t doing anything, then like it’s doing everything too fast. In short, they can be jerky. The SHO’s EcoBoost engine displayed none of that. There was a slight hesitation passing at highway speeds as the transmission kicked down a gear or two, but it wasn’t bad compared with most cars; it’s only noticeable if you compare it with other performance cars. Mostly there was just a good sense of pulling power across the rev range.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system deserves praise, too, because I really had the sense that the car was hunkering down — in a good way — and grabbing the road to propel me forward, whether I was accelerating in a straight line or in a curve. Also, the SHO has a sport-tuned suspension, but it didn’t beat me up over rough roads.\n\nThe SHO comes with paddle shifters, and while they’re no substitute for a true manual transmission (which isn’t available on the SHO), they did make the engine/transmission even more enjoyable. I could hold gears longer when I wanted to really accelerate, and I could pass much more quickly.\n\nFor my money, getting the SHO going is where the enjoyment ends. The problems start with getting the SHO stopped.\n\nA good performance car will have a brake pedal that’s a bit firm, so it’s easier to feel how you’re stopping the car. The process should also be direct and linear, so the harder you press the pedal, the more vigorously the car stops. The SHO’s brakes didn’t deliver. The pedal was too mushy to inspire confidence, and I never got a handle on just how hard to press the pedal to make a quick stop.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, turning the SHO isn’t the greatest experience, either. Cruising around parking lots, the initial signs were encouraging: There was a bit of resistance, and I had a good sense of how the car was moving. Once you top about 10 mph, though, it all goes to heck because the steering gets too light and there’s not enough feedback. It wouldn’t be atrocious in a normal car, but if this is supposed to be a performance car, it’s just too light.\n\nFinally, the seats are too soft. A good sport seat should cradle and support you. Some are more firm than a normal seat, yes, but they don’t have to be, provided the bolstering is high and supportive enough to hold you in place. The only thing holding me in place in the Taurus was the weight of my rear end.\n\nWhile that is substantial, during turns at speed I had to brace myself with my legs and arms, and tense up my abdominal muscles to keep from flopping over in the seat. Again: This isn’t terrible if you’re cruising around, but it’s exactly the opposite of what you want when you’re trying to drive fast.\n\nMy overall impression was that I would never want to take the SHO on a racetrack. I never had any sense of what the car was trying to tell me.\n\nAs a Daily Driver\nIn this realm, the Taurus SHO does better. The V6 engine is strong, and as I’ve said, the steering is well-tuned for parking lots and cruising at low speeds, as you would on city streets.\n\nThe same lack of support that damns the SHO’s seats as a performance car can make them more comfortable for longer drives. (Personally, I find a softer seat to be more tiring on a long drive, but I don’t think most people would take issue with sitting in the SHO on a long road trip.)\n\nIn fact, long highway drives are a strength of the Taurus. Set the cruise control and go. The engine makes passing on the highway a breeze, and the sport suspension isn’t too firm for fast driving over bad roads. Having AWD will provide a bit more security when the weather gets bad on your trip. Wipers on, and keep going.\n\nJust don’t bring too many people on that trip. True, all Ford Taurus models (SHO or not) are large cars on the outside. How large? The Taurus is 202.9 inches long, about 18 inches longer than the Ford Edge SUV and only about 4 inches shorter than a full-size Ford Expedition SUV. It’s about the same width as the Edge and, again, only about 2 inches narrower than the Expedition.  \n\nHaving a car that’s almost as big as a full-size SUV isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the problem here is that while both the Edge and especially the Expedition can carry more than two people comfortably, the Taurus struggles with that. One of my taller rear-seat passengers said she was cramped for headroom and that legroom wasn’t so great. And she was sitting behind a shorter person in the front seat; she couldn’t sit behind me because there just wasn’t enough room.\n\nWhat’s really interesting is that the Ford Taurus has a mammoth trunk. It’s one of the biggest I’ve seen in a car lately, and it was impressive. Still, I kept thinking, “Great, I’ve got enough room to carry guns for the entire Russian Army, but I can only take one soldier.”\n\nFinally, the Taurus’ exterior size means you have more to squeeze into parking spaces, which was a constant source of frustration. I admit I’m pretty rotten at parking, but usually after having a few tries in a car I get a sense of how to park it. This wasn’t the case with the Taurus. Side-to-side visibility is a problem thanks to the high windowsills, and the high hood made it difficult to judge where the front end was. I was often sorry to see my journeys end, if only for the fact that it meant I’d have to park it again.\n\nTo paraphrase a line from the movie “The Searchers,” the Taurus is both too much car and not enough.\n\nExterior & Interior\nThe full-size version of the Ford Taurus started out as the Five Hundred, but the name was eventually changed, and new styling, which substantially improved its looks, followed.\n\nIt’s a handsome car from the outside and one of very few that manage to make the fender side vents so common these days actually look good. I also like this car’s adoption of Ford’s three-blade grille, as it doesn’t look like something I shave my face with in the morning.\n\nOn the inside, the interior is well-laid-out, and I never found myself hunting or reaching uncomfortably for the buttons and controls I needed. I also thought the interior looked good and that there was a nice mix of materials.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Mileage\nReliability is predicted to be above average. The 2011 (and 2010) Ford Taurus is designated a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, meaning it scored the institute’s highest rating (Good) in front, side and rear crash tests and a roof-strength test, and that it comes with a standard electronic stability system. Mileage is estimated at 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway, which is the same as non-turbo models.\n\nTaurus SHO in the Market\nThe Taurus SHO is at its best on the highway or in the suburbs, but it’s not what I’d want to drive on a twisty road or a narrow city street. Visibility is OK on the highway, but bad while parking. The ride and handling made me want to drive the car all the way to Nebraska, but I wouldn’t want to take it around a racetrack.\n\nI think your affection for this car will be directly proportional to how many long highway drives you undertake. The more you travel that way, the more you’ll like the Taurus SHO. \n\nIt can’t really compete with other large, high-performance sedans, like those from Chevrolet or other manufacturers, though it does offer a nice ride and a decent engine. In the end, I kept coming back to the same idea: If this were the base Taurus and not intended in any way to be a performance variant, I’d be happier. It would still be big and in some ways hard to live with, but at least I wouldn’t feel like I’d spent my money on a sporty car that wasn’t.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Like a prehistoric animal living blissfully without influence from the rest of the world, the 2014 Ford Taurus has had evolutionary blinders on; it simply hasn’t changed quickly enough to stay competitive in this class.\n\nIn fact, the Taurus might just get eaten alive by the more modern and advanced Hyundai Azera, Chevrolet Impala, and Chrysler 300S. See them compared side by side here. We tested these sedans and a few others in Cars.com’s $38,000 Full-Size Sedan Challenge.\n\nThe Taurus’ possible saving grace, however, is as a family pack mule, with a backseat that can fit three kids or three child-safety seats across, plus trunk space to schlep even the most challengingly large family loads.\n\nThe Taurus hasn’t changed notably for the new model year. The only slight change is the addition of an available lane-keeping system in Limited and SHO trim levels. See the 2013 and 2014 models compared side by side here.\n\nThe 2014 Taurus has four trims to choose from: the front-wheel-drive Ford Taurus SE, the front- or all-wheel-drive (AWD) SEL and Limited, and the AWD SHO, all of which are powered by a high-performance, twin-turbo V-6 engine. The SE can also be had with a four-cylinder. See the trims compared side by side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Ford Taurus’ front grille looks a little like the wide, gaping mouth of a whale shark. It does get a little better from there, however, with additional bits of chrome jewelry on the exhaust tips and solid, grounded-looking 19-inch wheels on the Limited version I drove. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard on the base SE trim.\n\nThe Ford Taurus comes in a range of 10 available exterior colors with body-colored door handles. While all the basics are there, there are also a few unique color options for the more adventurous ones among us, like Kodiak Brown Metallic and Sunset Metallic (a sparkling burnt orange color), so we can express ourselves.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nAs a family workhorse, this full-size Ford sedan has the ability to haul even full-size families with full-size cargo needs. All three positions of the rear seat are quite comfortable (I know — I tried them out myself over many miles). A low floor hump below the center passenger’s feet and a bench that’s almost as soft and comfortable there as in the outboard positions makes the center seat just as usable as the others. This may sound like a minor thing, but sitting in the center rear seat in every vehicle in our recent Full-Size Sedan Challenge has given me newfound sympathy for my youngest daughter, who often gets squeezed into that rock-hard and sometimes raised center stack middle seat.\n\nThe 20.1 cubic feet of trunk space in the Ford Taurus was the most voluminous in our Challenge thanks to the Taurus’ recessed floor. It allowed a shocking 10 golf bags to be piled in. Hockey sticks, backpacks, sleeping bags and Costco runs can all be swallowed without so much as a burp from the Taurus. This feels massive compared with the Chrysler 300’s 16.3 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nThe Ford Taurus’ functionality and backseat are overshadowed, however, by the antiquated and messy aesthetics of the front of the cabin. An abundance of black plastic surfaces gives this brand-new vehicle the look of a gently used rental car. I loved having three cupholders in the center area between the driver and passenger, as I regularly have both a latte and a bottle of water during my morning run; having that third cupholder meant my husband could also store his coffee. However, the cupholders have hinged lids that have to be flipped open to use the cupholders. This created a cluttered look, with sharp, squared-off corners and edges sticking up this way and that. I’d much rather have cupholders that are always open for easy access — and that are trimmed out more elegantly, like those in the Toyota Avalon.\n\nWhile Ford and Microsoft have theoretically improved the MyFord Touch system, there’s still a general lag in touch-response time, not to mention the cluttered and confusing interface that’s impossible to interact with without removing your eyes from the road. If my $200 iPhone can react instantaneously when I touch it, a $35,000 car with touch-screen technology should be at least as quick and easy to use. One of my biggest pet peeves with this system is the presence of four main navigation “buttons” in the corners of the screen that are too narrow for a normal-size finger to touch.\n\nTall drivers with longer legs may also complain about the wide center console cutting into their knee room. The consumer who test-drove all the cars in our Challenge had to press his knee and leg up against the side of the console for the entire drive in order to properly reach the accelerator. He commented on how uncomfortable this would be for long drives.\n\nIf you can get around this issue, buyers of the Taurus Limited will fawn over the heated and ventilated power-assist front seats, which are standard on that trim level.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nUnfortunately, the Ford Taurus just didn’t live up to the high driving standard set in our Challenge. When accelerating, there was quite a lag before the Limited’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine’s power really kicked in. It took more nursing than I would like to get smooth acceleration up to speed from a full stop.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Ford Taurus gets an EPA-estimated 19/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined with the V-6, which puts it in the middle of the similarly equipped sedans in our Challenge. The 300S, Dodge Charger SXT Plus and Azera (all 2013 models) are all rated 23 mpg combined. The 2014 Impala and 2013 Nissan Maxima are rated 22 mpg, and the 2013 Avalon leads with an estimated 25 mpg combined.\n\nThe Ford Taurus suffered a lot of lean in corners, which I noticed both as a driver and as a backseat passenger. In the back, I was thrown around on a twist and then a turn while the driver got up to speed approaching a highway on-ramp. From the center rear seating position, I had to grab the handles on either side of the car to catch myself and stay upright. This lack of support isn’t just in the rear seat, but can also be sensed by the driver as a feeling of apprehension when cornering, plus an innate desire to brake midway through a corner just to gain a sense of sure footing. The brakes were a bit touchy, which I felt equally as a passenger.\n\nThe Taurus’ suspension did recover easily from a large recessed bump in the highway while at speed, where several of the other cars in our Challenge bounced a few times before finally settling down.\n\nCabin noise inside the Ford Taurus was quite obtrusive, even on smoother roads. I had to raise my voice to be heard from the backseat, and the notes I dictated to my iPhone while in the Taurus were illegible. You might be quick to blame this on Siri’s lack of voice-recognition skills, but I could easily decipher all my notes taken in other cars in our Challenge, which covered the same roads at the same speeds. The ones taken in the Taurus were about as understandable as hieroglyphics: “Very fast can come are the toilet seat” and “Wakefield Moshi comparing to the other.” (If you have any idea what those might mean, please email me.)\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2014 Taurus received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 2013 Taurus earned the institute’s Top Safety Pick designation, which represents top scores in all tests except the new small-overlap crash test, to which no car in this class has been subjected. Because the Taurus is mechanically unchanged for 2014, the results should apply to the new model year.\n\nAs has been required since the 2012 model year, the 2014 Taurus has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The Taurus also features six standard airbags, including driver and passenger front airbags, driver and passenger torso side airbags, and side curtain airbags extending to cover both rows. While this may seem good enough, again this feels like an area in which Ford has the expertise to expand and evolve; competing cars in the segment offer up to 10 standard airbags.\n\nA Belt Minder system that alerts the driver if any of the front or rear occupied seats have an unbuckled seat belt is standard on all trim levels, as is a tire pressure monitor. A rearview camera is standard on Limited and SHO trims and optional on the Ford Taurus SEL. A blind spot monitoring system with cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control is optional on both the Ford Taurus Limited and SHO, as is a lane-keep assist system.\n\nThe wide backseat in this Ford makes it one of the few sedans we’ve tested than can fit three child-safety seats side by side, in certain configurations. The Taurus’ Latch anchor configuration is a little different from most vehicles. While most cars have two sets of Latch anchors (one set in each of the outboard seats), they typically don’t allow a center seat to be installed via Latch by using an anchor from either side. The Taurus’ anchors are different. They’re slightly offset, but built to allow for attachment to either the center position or the outer positions, but not both at the same time. This allows for greater flexibility for a growing family with one or two child-safety seats to install with the Latch anchors. However, three cannot be used with Latch at the same time. Learn more in the 2014 Taurus Car Seat Check.\n\nThe downside to this configuration lies in a family situation like my own. My two youngest daughters (ages 8 and 10) are still in booster seats, and we use Latch to attach their Clek Olli seats. One of the Taurus’ Latch anchors is directly behind a seat belt buckle. So, if two Latch-connected boosters were installed in the outer two positions, the left seat would sit directly on top of two sets of belt buckles, effectively blocking both the left and center positions from being able to buckle their belts.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nTAURUS IN THE MARKET\n“Taurus” is one of those nameplates that has simply been around forever. I remember my parents renting a Taurus on vacation when I was a young child, and I thought it was the coolest, most comfortable car ever. While the current Taurus’ backseat is still quite plush and comfortable, nearly everything else about the car is due for an overhaul. Let’s hope that overhaul comes sooner rather than later. Otherwise this iconic name may get left in the dust in favor of its more progressively evolving competitors.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The speedometer tells the story.\n\nThe circular loop starts at 0 m.p.h. and doesn’t stop for about 180 degrees until it reaches 140 m.p.h.\n\nThis is not an economy car. Nor is it the industry mileage champ or even a runner-up.\n\nIt’s the Taurus SHO, the muscle-bulging performance version of the Ford family sedan, with power supplied sumo-style, thanks to Yamaha of Japan and its 3-liter, 24-valve, 220-horsepower V-6 under the hood. Japan bashing only goes so far at Ford-obviously until it reaches 220 horsepower.\n\nWhile only a five-speed manual is offered now, reportedly a four-speed automatic will become available this fall for the 1993 model year, which will make SHO available to the masses. The five-speed manual is a smooth-shifting unit when a dry and open road stares you in the windshield. The five-speed is far less balky than in the past, thanks to the switch to a solid rod from the prior cable-shifting mechanism.\n\nYet while SHO was built for go, we found ourselves on the expressway with the needle pointing at 10 m.p.h.-130 m.p.h. short of Utopia.\n\nThe weather was lousy, the roads covered with a thin layer of snow. On this day, SHO is for slow.\n\nA 140-m.p.h., 24-valve, 220-horsepower, V-6-powered car makes little sense in a 10-m.p.h. rush-hour crowd. The power potential meant little to the drab Plymouth Reliant merging at Dempster Street directly in front of the muscular Ford.\n\nSHO’s redeeming grace is that it’s a Taurus, a roomy, comfortable, freshly styled for 1992 midsize sedan with above-average ride and more-than- respectable handling.\n\nThe SHO first appeared in 1989 as the high-performance version of Taurus. The criticism since then has been that SHO looked just like the regular Taurus, unlike the SSE performance version of the Bonneville sedan at Pontiac, which was decidedly different in appearance.\n\nFor ’92 the Taurus was restyled, and that gave Ford a chance to give SHO a bit different look from the normal sedan. SHO now sports special color-keyed bodyside and rocker-panel moldings, flared mud spats, a different grille with integrated fog lamps, a different rear bumper and 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nTo improve ride and handling, the suspension was retuned and now incorporates stiffer springs and larger-diameter stabilizer bars. The larger 16-inch tires and nitrogen-gas-pressurized front and rear shocks complement the package.\n\nFor safety, SHO offers four-wheel disc brakes with antilock. A driver- side air bag is standard, a passenger-side bag is optional ($488). With ABS and the air bags, you don’t have to hide SHO in the garage when snow starts falling, though you don’t deliberately set out for a 300-mile journey behind its wheel if you don’t have to.\n\nThe SHO starts at $23,772. Options include $491 for a digital disc player.",

      "expert_review": "Remember the TV show “Extreme Makeover?” On it, people opted for plastic surgery and new diet and exercise regimens and ended up looking so different they were almost alien. The 2010 Ford Taurus has undergone an equal amount of transformation, minus the freakish effects. During my test drive, I parked next to an older Taurus and the difference was shocking. The 2010 model was twice as tall as and so much more stylish than the older version. Ford seems to have created an entirely new animal without using a single strand of the old generation’s DNA.\nOnce upon a time, the Taurus was the typical bland sedan with four doors, a roomy interior, sluggish performance and pricing to match. Today’s Taurus is a performance machine built to turn heads and stimulate enthusiasm. The Taurus starts at $25,170; my test car — a top-of-the-line Limited trim with front-wheel drive — cost $37,080.\nThis full-size sedan is powerful and fun to drive — even more so when I used the paddle shifters on the steering wheel. However, it maneuvers like a big, heavy car. I had some difficulty parking it because of its size.\nEXTERIORDespite its size, the Taurus is sporty. The front end looks intimidating because of its angular headlights and large chrome grille. Sporty creases on the Taurus’ sides add to its sporty look. Many cars have stylized front and rear ends, but they seem to forget about the sides. With Taurus, its spicy character sizzled everywhere I looked.\n\nThe Taurus has a 263-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. It gets an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway. I was relieved to see that the Taurus takes regular gas because I was at the gas station in it more often than I like.\n My boys had no problems opening and closing the sedan’s doors and climbing in and out of the sedan. The trunk is gigantic, but my father pointed out that its opening could’ve been bigger, especially considering the cargo area’s size. All in all, I was able to transport my groceries just fine, and I loved the cargo net that kept bags from flying around the trunk.\n\nSENSE AND STYLEFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): ExcellentFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\nINTERIORMy family really liked the looks of the 2010 Taurus, both inside and out. However, its center stack and instruments overwhelmed me at first. I grew to appreciate the shiny trim pieces. The chrome trim surrounding the instrument gauges reflected outside lights and created bolts of moving light that were pretty but distracting while driving.\n\nNear the gearshift and center console, clutter in the two front cupholders can be hidden behind doors. The power-adjustable pedals and tilt/telescoping steering wheel makes life so much easier for height-challenged people like myself.\nInstead of a bench seat in the front row, the new Taurus has bucket seats, which were the most comfortable seats I’ve ever experienced. I felt comfortable driving the Taurus thanks to its optional heated seats and ingenious massage system, which is meant to aid circulation during long trips. Any trip with kids is long, so I opted to leave my massagers on at all times.\nThe Charcoal Black leather throughout the interior was a bit dark but sexy in its own right. If I were buying a Taurus I’d stick with the leather seats, but opt for the neutral Light Stone interior color to better hide all the crumbs my kids leave behind.\n Not really the technology buffs, my hubby and I had to pull out the owner’s manual to get my phone to connect with Ford’s Sync multimedia system; thankfully, it only took a few minutes to set it up. The kids loved calling Dad from the car, which we did every single time we got in it; it was a long week for my hubby. It was cool to hear his voice coming through the speakers, but I’d recommend making several practice calls while in Park before using the system on the road.\n The Taurus’ second row is spacious and has a fold-down armrest with two cupholders within easy reach. The backseat has optional heated seats, too.\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNTStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): AmpleCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nSAFETYI’ve never seen a Latch system like the one in the Taurus; it’s certainly not designed with a family in mind. The location of the lower Latch anchors is really awkward. Instead of sitting in the traditional positions in the outboard seats, they’ve been moved inward toward the backseat’s armrest. This position causes a booster seat to sit on top of the seat belt receptor. My sons’ booster seats have rigid clamps that grab the lower Latch anchors, but they didn’t work well in this setup.\nThe Latch anchors’ position would work for a convertible child-safety seat and a rear-facing infant-safety seat. There’s plenty of legroom in the backseat to easily accommodate rear-facing car seats.\nWhile I’m not wild about the Taurus’ Latch system, I do appreciate that it’s been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety award, a car must receive the top score of Good in frontal, side-impact, rear and rollover crash tests as well as have a standard stability control.\nIn addition to the standard stability control, the Taurus has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control and six airbags, including side curtain airbags for both rows. The Taurus also has optional all-wheel drive.\nMy test car had optional rear parking sensors, a blind spot warning system and a collision prevention system.\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Ford Taurus here.",

      "expert_review": "Never has a car so captivated the motoring public.\n\nAnd never has a car so angered those same folks only a few years later.\n\nSuch has been the plight of the Ford\n\nTaurus, launched for the 1986 model year, when General Motors Corp. owned the midsize car market.\n\nAlong came Taurus, a significant machine because Ford bet the farm on it. GM was redesigning its midsize cars. For some strange reason, GM decided motorists relished midsize coupes more than midsize sedans. So GM focused on new two-door– rather than four-door–cars.\n\nWhen you own the market for midsize cars, as GM did, you do what you damn well please.\n\nIn the midst of GM’s W-body midsize coupe–Buick Regal, Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Pontiac Grand Prix–campaign, Ford brought a pair of Taurus prototypes to the Chicago Auto Show in early ’85–one with a traditional grille, one with a floating Ford oval where the grille normally would be found. Auto-show visitors overwhelmingly favored the car without the grille and that’s the version Ford built.\n\nThat December, Ford brought out a four-door Taurus sedan and a Mercury companion called Sable to replace the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. Most industry observers felt Ford had made a reckless move.\n\nOverlooked, however, was the reaction Chicago Auto Show visitors gave the grille-less Taurus. After all, showgoers could have vetoed both prototypes and told Ford to keep the LTD.\n\nAfter a few months of getting used to the odd-looking Taurus, customers ran to showrooms. GM scrambled to bring out fresh, new midsize sedans, but it was too late.\n\nTaurus had become a household word and, by the 1992 calendar year, became the best-selling car in the industry, unseating the Honda Accord, which held the title from 1989 through 1991. Oddly, GM, as well as Chrysler, celebrated the Taurus victory because it deposed a Japanese nameplate at a time when Japanese cars were perceived as superior to U.S. makes. Taurus’ sales victory gave all U.S. cars instant credibility.\n\nOf note, Accord had taken the title away from the Ford Escort, the top seller in 1988. Taurus held the title from 1992 through 1996, before the Toyota Camry stepped up to win the crown the last two years.\n\nTaurus was a success story. Unfortunately, Ford didn’t handle success very well. It figured that if the public liked a radical-looking sedan in 1986, they’d welcome an even more radical redesign in 1996.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe ’96 Taurus was too curvy. And the taillamps drooped, as if the clay on the concept melted and no one bothered to prop it up. The car looked smaller than the model it replaced at a time when people were demanding bigger cars. Inside, most controls were housed in an oval pod in the center of the rounded and curvy instrument panel. There wasn’t a straight line to be found in or out of the car.\n\nWhile Ford poked fun at Accord and Camry as bland looking, it found that the more dramatic the styling, the quicker it grew old. Accord and Camry may be bland, but you don’t have to buy a new one every two or three years to keep in fashion.\n\nFor the 2000 model year, Taurus will be redesigned, with new front and rear-end treatments as well as a cabin overhaul. Taurus will look very much like the compact Ford Contour, a pleasantly conservative sedan.\n\nMore on that machine later. For now, we focus on the 1999 Taurus SE, the “last of” for the current generation.\n\nIn testing the SE, we found that while styling has taken much of the blame for Taurus falling behind Camry and Accord in sales, it isn’t the sole reason. Perhaps Ford has focused too much on Taurus styling at the expense of updating the engineering.\n\nThe Taurus SE feels too heavy and cumbersome. Camry and Accord may win no beauty crowns, but they certainly will walk away with the congeniality award.\n\nAccord and Camry are limber and nimble compared with a more cumbersome Taurus. You feel lots of weight in the wheel. The steering system is slow to respond to wheel input. The 3-liter, 160-horsepower V-6 strains to get the vehicle in motion. The optional 3-liter, 185-h.p., 24-valve V-6 would have fared better.\n\nThen, too, the seats are overstuffed and take up too much cabin room. You feel cramped, almost as if in a compact sedan. Curvy lines dominate. There isn’t a flat spot to place a pencil. Storage space is at a premium. The instrument pod housing all the controls seemed space age when introduced in 1996; now it looks confusing.\n\nTaurus needs to get slimmer and trimmer inside and out. It needs a V-6 with more muscle to move the bulk with less effort, or maybe just less bulk to move. And the power-steering system needs a shot of adrenalin to allow for more nimble maneuvering.\n\nWe hope the 2000 Taurus will provide more interior room, more storage compartments and softer, more comfortable seats.\n\nAnd whoever was in charge of curves in the current generation Taurus should be sent to a room with a ruler and made to draw straight lines until he comes back to his senses.\n\nThe SE we tested starts at $18,445. But options quickly add up. A “comfort” group at $1,500 adds six-way power driver’s seat, air conditioning, keyless entry and something called a light group. Ford loves to lump “groups” onto the sticker without explaining what secretive features are included.\n\nWith assorted other options and freight, the sticker came to $23,245.\n\nThe 2000 Taurus will be watched closely, by Ford and its dealers, some of whom complain that Ford has become a truck company–meaning pickups, sport-utility vehicles and mini-vans. A host of variations such as the Explorer Sport Trac for 2001, an Explorer SUV with a pickup bed, are planned for the near future.\n\nDealers say when customers walk in the door, it’s easy to sell them a Ford truck, but that there’s no whiz-bang, gotta-get-my-hands-on-that-thing car in the lineup. The 2001 Thunderbird will be such a vehicle, but only 20,000 will be available nationwide. And when a customer drives to the showroom to admire the Thunderbird but can’t afford the $35,000 plus options and premium price tag, what other car does Ford have to show them that will create excitement?",

      "expert_review": "The Taurus-like stock market and the Taurus by the Ford Motor Co. have had a common trait these past few months.\n\nThis astrological sign of the bull has been running wild in both categories, with the market ascending to spectacular heights and the automotive representative going right up the sales charts.\n\nPossibly, the Taurus stock market is beginning to run on tiring legs, but Ford’s 1998 Taurus sedan is snorting along, stronger than ever, as a sales leader for the Ford Division.\n\nAs the ’98 model year winds down, the Taurus can look back on features such as a redesigned front end and functional improvements as prime contributors to its marketing success. The car appeals to a broad spectrum of age groups and income levels.\n\nFord has realigned its mainstream sedans into two straightforward series, the LX and the SE. It also continues to offer the limited edition SHO high-performance model.\n\nThe “high” in performance just about matches the high in price for this 3.4-liter 32-valve V-8 powered four-door. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price is $29,000, considerably more than the $18,345 for the LX or $19,445 for an SE.\n\nHowever, the SHO is a special set of wheels, with an aluminum block, four-cam 60-degree V-8. This is the first V-8 offered in a Taurus, with a power rating of 235-horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThat’s good for some speedy motoring of 0-60 mph in about 7.4 seconds. This is more than a full second quicker than the standard Taurus 3.0-liter V-6.\n\nFord raised its standard equipment levels for ’98, and offers more free-standing options.\n\nA new Sport Group features an optional 200-horsepower double overhead cam Duratec V-6. Also featured by the Sport Group is a rear deck spoiler, chrome bolt-on wheel covers, five-passenger seating with floor console and shifter quadrant, SecuriLock anti-theft system, and front fenders that get a “24V” (valves) badging.\n\nThe torque of the Duratec V-6 matches the horsepower at 200 foot-pounds. The engine has been upgraded for improved throttle response and quick passing ability.\n\nIn addition, a blend of technology and durability allows the motor to go without a tune-up for 100,000 miles. A switch to a new organic-acid technology engine coolant also means no cooling system service is necessary for 100,000 miles beyond the regular belt and fluid level checks.\n\nBoth the LX and SE benefit from a more assertive front fascia for ’98. The appearance is distinctively Ford, with the Ford oval insignia blending into a chrome bar over a subdued black grille.\n\nNew fluted park-turn lamps lend a jewel-like touch to the front of the car. At the rear, the overall appearance is refined with a consistent monochrome treatment for the taillights and rear applique.\n\nThe Taurus always could lay claim to a jazzy-looking interior. The instrumentation panel, control panel, and shifter quadrant have that oval shape that is reminiscent of the Ford oval-shaped theme. The oval badge shape is a tradition that dates back to Henry Ford.\n\nSix-passenger seating is standard, but also offered are front bucket seats with a low profile center console and steering column shift. This is a no-cost option on the SE.\n\nFor those who prefer a full console, there is this third choice with the 3.0-liter Vulcan V-6 in the SE.\n\nStructurally, the ’98 Taurus has retained the basic overall dimensions of the automobile that first appeared on the market as a l996 model.\n\nOverall length is 197.5 inches, and the wheelbase is 108.5 inches.\n\nThere is a Taurus wagon at 199.6 inches of length that adopts the sedan’s fundamental elliptical shape. Available only in SE form, it is mounted on the same wheelbase as the sedan, and from the rear windows forward, is basically the same contour.\n\nIn traditional wagon versatility, when an optional rear-facing third seat is added, it can hold up to eight.\n\nThe ’98 Taurus retains, of course, its front-drive four-speed automatic transaxle, four-wheel independent suspensio n, and unitized body/chassis construction for maximum rigidity.\n\nOn balance, it carries the Ford flag forward in a highly competitive marketplace, and establishes the parameters needed for the 21st century.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Ford Taurus boasts refined driving and good fuel efficiency, but two long-standing drawbacks remain — and unfortunately, now there’s a third.\n\nLast redesigned for 2010, the Taurus this year boasts styling tweaks: a new turbo four-cylinder engine and a raft of interior updates. The turbo four is optional on front-wheel-drive SE, SEL and Limited trim levels, which otherwise get a lower-mileage V-6. The Taurus SHO, meanwhile, has last year’s turbocharged V-6 but visually is further differentiated from the base Taurus this year. (Ford markets both turbocharged engines with the EcoBoost name.) All-wheel drive is optional on the V-6 Taurus and standard on the SHO. Compare the trims here, or stack the 2013 Taurus against the 2012 here.\n\nI tested a Taurus SHO and an all-wheel-drive SEL at a media preview. We later drove a front-drive Taurus SEL with the turbo four-cylinder.\n\nDecent Power With Any Engine\nThanks to punchy midrange torque, the turbo four-cylinder lends energetic passing power. Editors found it a bit pokey off the line, but prompt accelerator response helps the car hustle when needed. EPA mileage totals a good 22/32 mpg city/highway — the best among its conventional gasoline competitors, if just by a hair. The Toyota Avalon Hybrid and 2014 Chevrolet Impala eAssist get better mileage still, but both combine gasoline and electric power.\n\nEnhanced this year with the same valve technology as the Mustang V-6, the Taurus V-6 has 288 horsepower, which is 25 hp more than the 2012. It moves well enough from a stop and pulls energetically at higher revs, with a muscular exhaust note as you take on more speed. Front-drive V-6 cars weigh 214 pounds less than all-wheel-drive versions, which should increase acceleration off the line.\n\nIn either car, the standard six-speed automatic transmission needs grooming: It holds higher gears coming into corners, delaying needed downshifts until moments too late, and hunts through gears on hilly roads. Step into the gas to pass and the transmission stair-steps down through multiple gears. A Sport mode does little to change the behavior.\n\nThe Taurus SHO automatic’s reactions feel quicker, with faster shifts and less indecision. The turbocharged V-6 scampers from a stop, hustling to higher speeds with the punchiness of a V-8. Indeed, our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in just 5.5 seconds in their 2010 SHO. That’s more than half a second quicker than a V-8-powered, all-wheel-drive Chrysler 300C that “MotorWeek” tested. The SHO weighs 4,341 pounds — lighter than the 300C but much heavier than front-drive competitors from Hyundai, Toyota, Chevrolet and Nissan. For such a portly car, this Ford flies.\n\nIn keeping with other full-size sedans, ride quality is very good. The Taurus SHO’s sport-tuned suspension picks up a little more chop over bumps, but on high-speed stretches it isolates the cabin as well as its comfort-tuned counterpart. A SHO Performance Package adds even firmer shocks and springs, retuned steering, up-rated cooling hardware and a 3.16:1 final drive ratio for quicker acceleration but lower gas mileage. Our SHO didn’t have this package — leaving us a 2.77 final drive instead — but Taurus engineer Carl Widmann says the package removes a lot of the SHO’s ride comfort for the sort of buyer “who takes his car to the track every once in a while or just wants to drive like a maniac all the time.”\n\nWith a balanced chassis, good steering feedback and linear brakes, the overall experience suits the base Taurus, though the new electric power steering — included on last year’s SHO and now standard — feels under-assisted at low speeds for a full-size car. The SHO’s wheel takes more effort still, and I’m lukewarm on the payoff. The car is a supreme highway cruiser, but for a performance car it has too much body roll on curvy roads, and the steering feels a bit slow on initial turn-in — even though Ford quickened the ratio to 15:1 this year from last year’s 17:1 ratio.\n\nNew for this year, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder’s mileage beats all comers. The V-6 Chrysler 300 comes close, at 31 mpg with its eight-speed automatic, but its city mileage gives up 3 mpg to the 2.0-liter Taurus. The Hyundai Azera and 2014 Chevrolet Impala come close to the V-6 Taurus’ 19/29 mpg while the redesigned V-6 Toyota Avalon’s 21/31 mpg closes ranks with the four-cylinder Taurus. Unfortunately, Ford recommends premium fuel for both turbo engines. Regular fuel will suffice, but with slight power losses.\n\nEngines Compared\n \tTurbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder\t3.5-liter V-6\t3.5-liter turbo\nAvailability\tSE, SEL, Limited FWD only\tSE, SEL, Limited FWD or AWD\tSHO AWD only\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t240 @ 5,500\t288 @ 6,500\t365 @ 5,500\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t270 @ 3,000\t254@ 4,000\t350 @ 1,500 – 5,000\nEPA mileage\n(city/highway, mpg)\t22/32 (FWD)\t19/29 (FWD);\n18/26 (AWD)\t17/25 (AWD)\nFuel\tPremium recommended*\tRegular\tPremium recommended*\n*Regular usable, but produces less power.\nSource: Automaker and EPA data.\n\nIssues Remain, and a New One Arrives\nWe’ve harped on the Taurus’ cramped confines (see the review), and the problem persists. It’s one of the largest cars in this class, with length and width exceeding even the imposing 300 and its Dodge Charger twin. The Taurus boasts the roomiest trunk in the segment, with a backseat that should suit even long-legged adults. Even so, the Taurus’ overall passenger volume trails all but the undersized Maxima’s, and it’s felt most up front. The seats have generous adjustment range, but the thick doors and massive center console limit hip and knee room. At least Ford added padding along the console.\n\nVisibility is another problem. Thick pillars, blocky rear head restraints and a low roofline limit the view in all directions. It’s ironic, because this Taurus generation’s predecessor had outstanding sight lines.\n\nThe third issue is MyFord Touch. I’m against carmakers replacing physical controls with touch-sensitive panels, whether it’s the Chevrolet Volt or an increasing number of Ford and Lincoln products. The latest version of MyFord Touch gets a few more mechanical controls, like the often-brushed hazards button, and it responds faster than the system’s earliest versions. But I still found myself hitting the wrong buttons, tapping climate controls a half-dozen times to adjust the temperature a few degrees, and waiting for a heated-seat icon to register three bars of heat while I wondered if I should tap it again. Competitors like the Charger and 300 have touch-screens with quicker response, and they retain separate physical knobs. MyFord Touch is better than it used to be, but the Ford cars that execute it best — the Focus compact, the 2013 Escape and the F-Series — combine the touch-screen with physical controls below.\n\nYou can skip MyFord Touch in the Taurus SE and SEL, but pricier trims and top-shelf options require it.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Taurus scored top marks in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, earning it a Top Safety Pick designation. IIHS has yet to administer its new small-overlap frontal test on the Taurus, but the car has also earned five out of five stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s more rigorous side-impact tests. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, head-protecting side airbags and an electronic stability system with Ford’s new Curve Control, which can brake more wheels than the stability system alone to slow things down if you enter a corner too fast. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nSafety options include adaptive cruise control with a collision warning system, lane departure and blind spot warning systems and a cross-traffic warning system.\n\nReliability for the current-generation Taurus has been average for front-wheel-drive cars but subpar for all-wheel-drive models. Take note, however, that MyFord Touch has contributed to steep reliability declines in certain Ford and Lincoln models. Time will tell if a revamped version can improve that.\n\nIncluding the destination charge, the Taurus SE starts around $27,500 — in line with the Charger and 2014 Impala, but cheaper than the Taurus’ Japanese competitors. Standard features fall far short of the $30,000-plus cars, but they do include a power driver’s seat, alloy wheels and a CD stereo with steering-wheel controls. Start adding options and you can get heated and cooled leather seats, a power passenger seat, navigation, a self-parking system and Ford’s Sync system with USB/iPod connectivity and Bluetooth audio streaming. An optioned-out Taurus SHO can top $45,000.\n\nTaurus in the Market\nFull-size sedans continued to lose market share in 2012 as shoppers chose family cars — a segment that boomed 24.8 percent — by more than four to one. In Ford’s stable, shoppers bought more than three Fusions for every Taurus through the year. Why wouldn’t they? Many family cars reach the mid-30s in EPA highway mileage, and a few of them have large enough interiors to squeak into full-size designation. It’s little wonder consumer tastes are shifting — and full-size cars need to be damn good to stay afloat. The Taurus has strengths in terms of ride comfort, trunk space and passing power, but its drawbacks could leave it overrun by the changing tide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFords midsize sedan and wagon earned major styling changes for 2000, with a more conservative look than the 1996  1999 generation. In recent years, it has invariably been one of the top three passenger cars in the annual sales race. Sales rose by nearly 4 percent in 2000 to an impressive 382,035 units. The Mercury Sable is built from the same design, also as a sedan and wagon, but it has more standard equipment and a higher sticker price.\n\nApart from new body colors, little has changed for 2002. New approach lamps let people know at night that a door is open. Ford has had a Taurus in its lineup since 1986. Available in LX, SE, SES and SEL trim levels, Taurus sedans can seat either five or six occupants, depending on the model.\n\nExterior\nAerodynamic teardrop-shaped headlights and large taillights are the major styling cues on the four-door Taurus sedan, which rides a 108.5-inch wheelbase. At 197.6 inches long overall, the Taurus is about 7 inches longer than the Chevrolet Malibu and 8 inches longer than the redesigned Toyota Camry. The Taurus sedan is 73 inches wide and 56.1 inches tall, and it comes with 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the model, buyers can seat either six people, with a folding center storage console in front, or five passengers with front buckets. Six-passenger seating is standard on the LX, SE and SES sedans, while the top-of-the-line SEL has space for five. All four doors contain map pockets, and the trunk holds 17 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nStandard LX equipment includes air conditioning, a tilt steering wheel, cloth upholstery, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Remote keyless entry, cruise control and a cassette stereo go into the SE sedan. Moving up to an SES brings antilock brakes, a six-way power drivers seat, a CD player and a split, folding rear seat. Heading the lineup, the SEL gets automatic climate control, an in-dash CD changer and cassette player, automatic headlights and power-adjustable pedals. Also optional on other models, the power-adjustable accelerator and brake pedals have a 3-inch range.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo 3.0-liter V-6 engines are available. The base engine has overhead valves and produces 155 horsepower, and the SEL sedan comes with a dual-overhead-camshaft V-6 that makes 200 hp. Both engines mate with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nFront airbags deploy at one of two inflation levels based on crash severity, whether the seat belts are buckled and the position of the drivers seat. Optional side-impact airbags protect the heads and chests of front occupants. Antilock brakes are optional, combined with an all-speed traction control system.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough the Taurus sedan is satisfying in most respects, it doesnt stand strongly above the midsize pack, including the league-leading Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Ride and handling are acceptable, but the Taurus can feel a little ponderous at times and its suspension doesnt produce a truly gentle experience. The Mercury Sable tends to come across as more appealing, whether its for highway or urban driving.\n\nPerformance with the dual-cam V-6 is vigorous and responsive. The automatic transmission functions in an easygoing manner, with just a bit of hesitation when downshifting. Interior space is ample, but large roof pillars have a negative effect on visibility. Seats are comfortable and supportive. Fords abundant safety features and attractive prices help make the Taurus a good buy against much of the competition, despite a few drawbacks.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to popular American cars, they don’t get any more popular than the Ford Taurus.\n\nThrough August, Ford produced 227,704 Taurus cars. That’s more than the entire lines of BMW, Chrysler, Daewoo, Dodge, Mercedes-Benz, Lincoln, Jaguar, Mercury, Volvo, Cadillac, Saturn, Acura, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Porsche, Mitsubishi, Audi and Suzuki in the same period, according to Automotive News, an industry trade publication.\n\nWhat makes this car so popular?\n\nStart with the specs. This is a mid-size, four-door sedan, which is the heart of the mid-size car market. The styling, while not as radical as in the past, is distinctive enough not to get lost in a Wal-Mart parking lot.\n\nBut, here’s the bigger secret. Look at the base price of the test vehicle: $21,960. That will buy you the SES Sport trim level, which is designed to attract younger buyers who might otherwise look at a VW Passat, but can’t afford the VW’s stiffer price. The SES Sport is just below the top-rung SEL, but above the LX and SE versions.\n\nThe SES Sport is a good value, with a lot of standard features, including four-wheel anti-lock brakes, air-conditioning, rear defroster, power rack-and-pinion steering with variable assist, remote trunk release, keyless entry, power windows, mirrors and door locks, cruise control, aluminum wheels, front bucket seats with console, power driver’s seat with adjustable lumbar support, AM/FM/CD player, split-folding rear seats, power lumbar support, floor mats, rear spoiler and the ever-important illuminated visor mirrors.\n\nAll cars come with a V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission. The SES came with the double-overhead-cam 3-liter Duratec V-6, which is good for 200 horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque. It’s superior to the 3-liter overhead-valve Vulcan V-6, which furnishes less power and is found in lesser versions of the Taurus.\n\nThe test car, labeled ”Sport Edition” added special aluminum wheels, power moonroof, an upgraded audio system with a cassette player and a six CD changer, power adjustable pedals, side air-bags, traction control, perimeter lighting and auto-dimming rearview mirror with compass. The bottom line was still a respectable $24,300. That’s a lot of features for the money, especially considering the hefty incentives Ford offers on the Taurus, including $2,500 on 2002s and $1,000 on 2003s.\n\nThat seems to be the big secret: this is an affordable, nice-sized car that is perfect for handling the drudgery of everyday life.\n\nPower is good from the Duratec V-6, but like most overhead-cam engines, there’s not a lot of power off the line. At speed, there’s strong passing power once the automatic transmission downshifts. Fuel economy is about average for the size and power the car offers, about 18 mpg in city driving.\n\nHandling is a bit disappointing, considering that Ford has plastered the word ”Sport” on this car. While the car fee ls sharp at highway speeds, thanks to the variable assist power steering, there’s a lot of body lean in corners. This might be typical of your average family sedan, but not typical of a sports sedan.\n\nBraking, courtesy of front disc/rear drum brakes, is average. Stopping was accompanied by some nosedive. Panic braking brought out some twitchiness in the tail, but it was controllable.\n\nSome of the handling issues could be resolved by using better tires. The Continental tires on the test vehicle lost grip easily in foul weather and abrupt takeoffs. They squealed around corners, even at low speeds.\n\nThe interior was nicely designed, with a modern, functional dash that’s easy to understand and operate. Simple rotary controls operate the efficient climate controls. Touches such as a tilt steering wheel, variable speed intermittent wipers and open cupholders in the front console were thoughtful. The coin holder is a bit of a reach, buried behind the transmissio shifter. The CD-changer ate up most of the space in the center console’s storage bin.\n\nThe cloth-covered seats were comfortable, although a lack of thigh support is noticeable on long drives. Rear seating was accommodating, with head and foot room, but the curved rear door design makes it too easy for passengers to hit their head.\n\nOverall assembly quality seemed quite good. The interior ambience was nicer than that of the larger Crown Victoria, but it still had a somewhat stark feel.\n\nThe trunk is huge, perfect for family hauling duties. A cargo net is provided.\n\nThe Ford Taurus is a capable, competent family car that succeeds in pleasing the average American family.\n\nStill, it seems less refined than its chief rivals, the Honda Accord, which was redesigned for 2003, and the Toyota Camry, redesigned for 2002. The Taurus, redesigned in 1996, won’t be redesigned until 2005.\n\nIf Ford could take $500 or $1,000 from the rebate and apply it to better brakes, suspension and a finer grade of interior plastic, this car would be even more popular.",
