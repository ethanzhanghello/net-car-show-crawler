      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: There are no significant changes for 2022, a year that follows the Bronco Sport’s debut as a 2021 model. Minor updates include three new paint colors and some reshuffled options packages.\n\nPricing: Price increases are modest, at less than $400 for all but the top trim level. The base 2022 Bronco Sport starts at $28,910 — up $200 from 2021. The Bronco Sport’s four trim levels top out with the Badlands model, which starts at $35,585 — up $730 from 2021. All prices include a $1,495 destination charge.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022? With only slight increases in price for most trim levels, you might as well go for a 2022 Bronco Sport. But with new vehicles currently in tight supply, you’ll likely be getting essentially the same vehicle if you can only find a 2021. As of late December 2021, about a third of the new Bronco Sports listed for sale on Cars.com are 2021 models.\n\nThe Bronco Sport compact SUV was all-new for 2021, and it continues into its sophomore year with no substantial changes. \n\nRelated: 2021 Ford Bronco Sport Review: Who Ordered the Budget Land Rover?\n\nThe Sport shares some underpinnings with the latest generation of Ford’s Escape SUV, but upgrades like standard all-wheel drive add genuine off-road capability for adventurous getaways. In contrast to the Escape’s city-friendly styling and interior, the Bronco Sport has a rugged-looking interior and upright, squared-off styling that borrows macho elements from the full-size Bronco SUV; some onlookers might also see hints of Land Rover influence.\n\nThe 2022 model year brings some renaming of existing options packages, and the Bronco Sport’s optional power moonroof is available only as part of the SUV’s Convenience, Tech and Premium Packages. There also are three new paint colors — Bronze Smoke Metallic, Hot Pepper Red Tinted Clearcoat and Velocity Blue Metallic — while two 2021 colors are dropped.\n\nThe Bronco offers four carryover trim levels (the debut year also offered a one-off First Edition model). The trims include a well-equipped base model and a Big Bend trim with more convenience features and available options. Both value-oriented models include standard AWD, an 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, and a basic suite of active safety technology.\n\nTopping the line in price are two versions with differing personalities. The Outer Banks is more civilized, with leather upholstery, fancier wheels and upscale features. The Badlands is the bad boy, with more power, an off-road-tuned suspension, more aggressive tires, skid plates, a 180-degree front camera, its own cloth upholstery with improved cleanability and more-capable AWD with additional off-road drive modes.\n\nPowertrains\n\nPowertrains for 2021 carry over unchanged. All trim levels except the Badlands have a 181-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission, plus standard AWD and five electronic drive modes. The Badlands has a standard 250-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic, upgraded AWD and seven drive modes.\n\nSafety\n\nUnchanged from 2021, all Bronco Sports have Ford’s Co-Pilot360 bundle of active safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, automatic high beams and a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert. Optional on all but the base model is upgraded Co-Pilot360 Assist Plus for $895, which adds adaptive cruise control with hands-on lane-centering and evasive steering assist, along with an onboard navigation system with speed sign recognition and satellite radio.\n\nPricing\n\nHere is the Bronco Sport’s 2022 pricing, including increases from 2021. The totals include a required $1,495 destination charge, which remains unchanged.\n\nBase: $28,910 (up $200)\nBig Bend: $30,475 (up $260)\nOuter Banks: $34,725 (up $370)\nBadlands: $35,585 (up $730)\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Ford Bronco Sport: When You Want a Bronco but an Escape Makes More Sense\n2021 Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport First Impressions: More Capable Than Expected?\n2021 Ford Bronco 2-Door and 4-Door: Jeep Has Some Homework to Do\n9 Ways the 2021 Ford Bronco is Not a Jeep Wrangler\nResearch Bronco Sport years and models\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: This Ford’s combination of on-road manners, genuine off-road ability, slick interior designs and rugged good looks make it a Land Rover for budget-minded buyers.\n\nVersus the competition: The only compact SUV that comes close to what the Bronco Sport can do is the “trail-rated” Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, and even then, the Bronco costs less. Other compact SUVs might have more interior room, but they’re really meant only for on-road driving, not cross-country adventures like the Bronco Sport. \n\nYes, I know, we’re all very excited for the arrival of the 2021 Ford Bronco, and everyone’s just abuzz about it: How well does it go off-road? Is it better than a Wrangler? Is the top easy to take down? How heavy are the removable doors? And so on. But what we should keep in mind is that Ford introduced not one but two SUVs under the Bronco name: the “big” Bronco and this one, the 2021 Ford Bronco Sport. \n\nHere’s where the off-road purists start their lament: “Oh, that’s not a proper off-road vehicle,” they’ll say. “That’s just a Ford Escape with some off-road bits stapled to it.” And while that’s not entirely inaccurate, it’s also not the whole story. Ford has made a lot of hay about how the big Bronco is super-capable off-road, with tons of technology, best-in-class specs and some genuine trail cred. Then the company pasted that “Bronco” name onto the front of this smaller, compact SUV — and that should also tell you something about it.\n\nRelated: 2021 Ford Bronco Sport: When You Want a Bronco but an Escape Makes More Sense\n\nDon’t Let Its Humble Roots Fool You\n\nThe compact Bronco Sport does indeed share some of its hidden bits with the Escape (as well as the no-longer-sold-in-the-U.S. Focus sedan), but those are common structural parts no buyer will ever see, like the expensive-to-make firewall stamping and other underbody elements. The Bronco Sport is shorter than the Escape both in wheelbase and in overall length, sporting very different dimensions aimed at creating a highly capable off-road SUV meant to challenge the Jeep Cherokee. Along the way, Ford has thoroughly engineered the SUV to do things that will surprise a lot of off-road purists who think only a body-on-frame, super-lifted, rear-wheel-drive, truck-based monster can successfully conquer trails. After spending an afternoon in the Bronco Sport with free run over a challenging off-road park, I’m here to tell you it may be a better choice for an everyday off-roader than the big Bronco itself. \n\nLet’s start with a quick discussion of the various types of Bronco Sport you can buy, as Ford has created five trim levels, each providing a different kind of experience. In order of increasing content, they are Base, Big Bend, Outer Banks, Badlands and First Edition.\n\nThe Base trim is exactly that: a no-frills compact SUV featuring everything you need for adventure, including a peppy turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine cranking out 181 horsepower and 190 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission that sends power to all four wheels. It has all the basics, like an 8-inch display screen, 17-inch wheels, an electronic Terrain Management System with Ford’s “G.O.A.T. Modes” (stands for “Goes Over Any Type of Terrain”), Ford Co-Pilot360 safety systems and more. Choose the Big Bend model and you’ll get some additional content, including two-way manually folding rear seats, privacy glass, push-button start, rubberized cargo floors and some other nice-to-have bits and pieces. The Outer Banks model is meant to be the nicer “luxury” version, with a leather interior, power seats, a digital gauge cluster and bigger 18-inch wheels. In “Jeep-speak,” you’d call this one the Sahara trim. \n\nThen we get to the top off-road model, the Badlands. It swaps out the turbo 1.5-liter engine for a 2.0-liter one that makes 250 hp and 277 pounds-feet of torque. It gets a 1-inch lift kit, a special off-road suspension, off-road tires, a more advanced four-wheel-drive system with a twin-clutch rear-drive differential, seven G.O.A.T. modes instead of five, underbody bash plates, tow hooks, a front trail camera and more. There’s also an even more exclusive First Edition model, but it’s already sold out, so I won’t bother with that one. Instead, let’s focus a lot of our attention on the Badlands model — which is deserving of that attention because it’s extraordinarily impressive. \n\nOut On the Road\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice about the Bronco Sport if you drive any version of it is that it feels like a bigger SUV than it is. The hood feels almost horizontal, and it’s big, square and very traditional-feeling, creating a similar sensation to sitting in the bigger Bronco. It’s pleasingly boxy, helping you see the corners of the SUV — useful in off-road situations or parking lot maneuvers. That formidable hood is the only thing that feels big about the Bronco Sport, though, as the rest of its dynamics show it to be a nimble, tight-handling little SUV that’s as good to drive on the street as it is in the dirt. \n\nThe turbocharged 1.5-liter engine that comes in the vast majority of Bronco Sports is torquey, peppy and has plenty of grunt for around-town driving. Slip the G.O.A.T. mode selector into Sport and it becomes truly quick, with the eight-speed automatic transmission keeping things on boil by maintaining a lower gear than it would in the normal driving mode. It does tend to run out of steam at higher speeds, however, so passing maneuvers on highways might require a little planning, but it never feels slow or ponderous in its operation; for the vast majority of users, it’s going to be plenty of motor. The optional turbo 2.0-liter engine takes things to the next level: Available only in the top Badlands and sold-out First Edition trim levels, you’ll pay for the privilege of extra power, but it does show noticeably better performance on acceleration. Honestly, though, I’d be perfectly happy with the 1.5-liter engine; the 2.0-liter seems more like a perk than a benefit. \n\nThe Bronco Sport handles well, too — despite fairly highly boosted steering feel — and definitely features some different characteristics depending on which trim level you choose. Lesser trim levels with their all-terrain tires feel a bit tighter, while the Badlands and its softer, lifted suspension and dedicated off-road tires feels a bit floatier. The Badlands is also a bit louder since its knobbier tires send more road noise into the cabin; given the Bronco Sport’s off-road intentions, though, this is neither unexpected nor unwelcome. The overall on-road driving experience is impressive, combining carlike handling with easy operation, a tall driving position, excellent outward visibility and the traditional crossover characteristics that have made the body style so popular.\n\nDeep in the Woods\n\nThe purpose of a Bronco Sport is not commuting; for that, Ford has the perfectly capable Escape. The Bronco Sport’s on-road civility means you can commute in it just fine, but it has the equipment, technology and engineering to be a highly capable off-road machine. Ford likes to bill the Bronco Sport as having a different mission than the big Bronco. The Sport is for getting you to basecamp with all your stuff so you can do whatever you came to do, whether hiking or kayaking or mountain biking. The big Bronco is meant to go further — to be the very reason you’re out in the wilderness, the activity you went off-road for. If that’s the case, though, Ford has made the Bronco Sport far more capable than it needs to be. \n\nMy afternoon with a Bronco Sport at the Holly Oaks Off-Road Vehicle Park in Southeast Michigan saw me take a Badlands over slippery rock faces, through high-speed sand pits, around tight wooded trails and down steep declines, all meant to be challenging for any SUV — and likely impossible for the vast majority of cute-ute crossovers. The Bronco Sport not only handled such obstacles with ease, it did so with a level of comfort that was absent in my previous ride-along in a big Bronco. Given its smaller dimensions that make it easier to shepherd through tight trails, one wonders if the Bronco Sport isn’t the better choice for a “casual” off-road adventurer, leaving the more expensive, heavier big Bronco for those who want the most hardcore experience they could have.\n\nFord makes it easy to take the Bronco Sport into the muck thanks to the use of its G.O.A.T. modes. The Badlands has seven of them, adding Mud/Ruts and Rock Crawl to the standard five of Normal, Eco, Sport, Slippery and Sand. You can lock the four-wheel drive yourself, but switching into the mode that matches your environment will do that for you as needed, along with making adjustments to things like electronic steering feedback, throttle input, transmission shift points, traction control and more. \n\nThis is where the budget Land Rover comparisons come in. The system feels similar to how the latest British-brand luxury SUVs handle a lot of their off-road duties. The Bronco Sport will match a lot of the abilities of a vehicle like a Land Rover Discovery Sport, and it comes with the added perk of a slew of more than 100 factory-approved accessories, ranging from lights to racks to rooftop tents that can be ordered along with the SUV at the point of purchase. Using their Terrain Response system, Land Rovers adjust a lot of the same systems Ford does with its G.O.A.T. modes, allowing for a multiple-personality SUV that’s perfectly comfortable on-road and perfectly capable off-road. Simply drive off the pavement, switch into the mode that best describes what you’re about to drive over, and away you go — no fuss, no muss. It works exceptionally well and will allow a lot of less experienced off-roaders to do things that require a bit of training in, say, a Jeep Wrangler, in which you need to know how to adjust most systems and equipment yourself. To Jeep’s credit, the Cherokee has a similar system that also adjusts various vehicle systems to the conditions; a full-on matchup between the Bronco Sport and Jeep Cherokee is an absolute must, and soon.\n\nGetting There Is Half the Fun (Possibly Three-Quarters of It)\n\nIn addition to crafting a massively capable budget Land Rover out of a Ford Escape, the Blue Oval has also added a considerable dash of style and utility to the interior. The Bronco Sport’s interior is completely different from the Escape’s, with a more industrial, rugged look to the shapes and surfaces that’s entirely in keeping with its family lineage to the Bronco line. There’s even an available rubberized floor covering in case you want something that’s easy to wipe out. It’s also notable that Ford has introduced to the Bronco Sport interior color that’s missing from a lot of SUVs these days — shades of blue, bronze, silver and orange that are all a welcome departure from the dull greige in a lot of competitor vehicles. \n\nWhile the interior is good, it’s also not perfect. As is the case with a lot of Fords, the seats feel smaller than they should be and are shaped in uncomfortable ways. The Badlands model’s optional leather-covered chairs had bottom cushions with an odd dome that made me feel like I was sitting on an exercise ball. The backseat is not terribly generous in the legroom department — likely a function of losing some wheelbase versus the Escape. Headroom isn’t an issue thanks to the Bronco Sport’s safari-style roof and upright, boxy styling. The cargo area looks plentiful, but Ford has not yet published dimensions for the Bronco Sport, so comparisons with other compact SUVs are difficult at this time. Of note here is the standard flip-up glass rear window, which is a feature you don’t often see anymore but which is useful for just popping something into the cargo area without having to open the entire hatch (and maybe having things spill out).\n\nOn the technology front, the Bronco Sport has all the modern amenities and safety conveniences you might expect from a new Ford, plus maybe one or two tech bits that seem a little odd. First, Ford Co-Pilot360 is standard, bringing things like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, auto high beams and a backup camera. Upgrade to Co-Pilot360 Plus and you’ll also get adaptive cruise control with lane-centering, evasive steering assist and more. \n\nThe multimedia system in the Bronco Sport is curiously not the latest Sync 4 system you can get in the new 2021 Ford F-150, but rather the older Sync 3 system that runs on an 8-inch touchscreen. It’s a little small in terms of display size — most new competitors have larger screens — but it’s as large and up-to-date as the system in the Escape. It also has something that Sync 4 doesn’t have: a “home” button, which we never thought we’d miss until Ford eliminated it in the F-150. The system still works fine, syncing up with a smartphone without issue, and provides Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in case you don’t want to use the native Ford systems.\n\nPriced to Compete — or Even Undercut\n\nThe baby Bronco has a commensurately more appealing price than the big Bronco, starting at $28,155 for a Base trim. That’s $350 more than you’d pay for a base Jeep Cherokee yet includes things the Cherokee doesn’t, such as standard four-wheel-drive. A Badlands with the bigger engine and lots of off-road goodies starts at $34,155 — nearly $2,700 less than a Cherokee Trailhawk’s starting price. Even more interesting: Load up a Bronco Sport Badlands with all the options (but none of the myriad available accessories) and you’ll come in just shy of $40,000. A loaded Cherokee Trailhawk costs $3,000 more than that and doesn’t have nearly as many interior color options or available leather seats. Its abilities, amenities and civility even position the Bronco Sport favorably against more expensive luxury off-road-oriented SUVs, like the Land Rover Discovery Sport, which it undercuts handily on price while comparing well with it in terms of powertrain and equipment. \n\nEither way, Ford’s message is clear: It has Jeep well in its sights with the Bronco lineup. Whether it’s gunning for the Cherokee with the Bronco Sport or the Wrangler with the big Bronco, the blue oval brand has come to play hardball in the off-road-capable SUV segment. Its first offering under the Bronco name is a worthy competitor to the Cherokee Trailhawk, and it’s in another league altogether than on-road-oriented SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4 or any number of other offerings in the class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Ford Bronco Sport a Good SUV?\n\nEquipped with serious all-terrain rubber, undercarriage armor and a clever all-wheel-drive system, the new 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Sasquatch is likely the most adventure- and off-road-capable compact SUV available.\n\nHow Does the Ford Bronco Sport Compare With Other SUVs?\n\nIf it’s off-road gumption you’re after, the Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness is the closest competitor, but with less power and available terrain tech. On a wider scale, look for serious commuter competition — but less character — from the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue.\n\nIf you’re in need of a compact SUV with genuine, real-deal off-road capability, you’d better ‘Squatch your Sport. Ahem — that is to say, ensure you order your 2025 Ford Bronco Sport with the new Sasquatch off-road package. It is, in my estimation, just about the most down-‘n-dirty, go-anywhere SUV you can have short of picking up something with true four-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: How Much Is the 2025 Ford Bronco Sport?\n\nI mean it. A day spent bounding through the Mojave desert at Ford’s invitation in the updated Bronco Sport impressed me far more than I expected and realigned my perception of what all-wheel-drive platforms are capable of. There are still limitations, of course, but that fabulously named Sasquatch Package goes a long way in making sure you won’t think twice about tackling that alarmingly remote trailhead. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\n2025 Ford Bronco Sport | Cars.com photo by Melissa Klauda\nWhat Is the Bronco Sport Sasquatch?\n\nWe’ll start with the Squatch, especially since Ford’s gone to great lengths to make what might be the most confusing cross-trim package I’ve seen. It’s available on just two trims: the uplevel, comfort-oriented Outer Banks and the range-topping, dirt-hungry Badlands. Regardless of trim, all Squatches add aggressive all-terrain tires on 17-inch wheels and steel skid plates, along with a few bits of utility hardware like a front brush guard and metal bumpers. That’s the easy bit.\n\nThe Sasquatch treatment brings the Bronco Sport Outer Banks’ capability closer to a base Badlands thanks to its trick twin-clutch rear differential. This is the first time the twin-clutch unit has been offered in conjunction with the Bronco Sport’s turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine.\n\nTick the Sasquatch kit when ordering your Badlands, and you’ll find that the rear shocks have been swapped for a set of position-sensitive Bilstein dampers. All Badlands variants also get a new sand-focused Rally mode in addition to the existing portfolio of driving modes. So, if the off-road capability of the standard Badlands wasn’t up to snuff, the Badlands with the Sasquatch pack should conceivably be the ultimate all-terrain adventure compact SUV.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Bronco Sport Like to Drive?\n\nI started in the heart of downtown San Diego, facing down a roughly hour-and-a-half drive to the off-road basecamp. A Bronco Sport with the Black Diamond off-road package was the assigned sled, and it painted a solid picture of the refreshed Bronco Sport’s on-road character. Only, outside of the Sasquatch Package and some new driver-assist features, the Bronco Sport’s tarmac capability hasn’t changed one bit; the rest of the refresh was primarily a tech upgrade, with every Bronco Sport now fitted with a standard 13.2-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel. The infotainment system runs on Ford’s Sync 4 digital architecture that’s fast, intuitive, and supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Badlands Sasquatch was first up for an off-road sand scrub. Our guided, follow-the-leader conga line of Badlands started with a trivial march over some pebbled hard pack that soon gave way to a field of soft sand, where we were encouraged to engage the new Rally mode. Now, in this mode, engine rpm is kept higher and accelerator response is sharpened, in addition to the stuff that happens behind the scenes to the AWD system and traction control parameters. Rally mode is good for some (reasonable) tail-out antics, but this sandy scramble was just a short obstacle to reach our first semi-technical challenge.\n\nI picked the trickiest of three ascents offered, with the moderately steep climb of crumbled sandstone providing an opportunity to upset the Bronco Sport’s traction. The Sasquatch’s 29-inch Goodyear all-terrain tires bit hard, with clear power transfer in the AWD system that had me up and over the crest with little issue. That said, I did notice a little clutch smell from it.\n\nNext was a rather severe low-speed descent, necessitating a team of spotters and careful corner placement. The updated hill descent control was just the trick, maintaining a 1 mph trail cruise without any driver inputs save steering. Seriously impressive stuff for a compact SUV, especially considering not one of us got even remotely stuck.\n\nThe Sasquatch’s special rear Bilstein shocks are the biggest change for the Badlands. Ride quality over washboard surfaces and through the slower, more precarious stuff was remarkably composed and significantly improved over the Outer Banks Sasquatch’s setup. Speaking of the Outer Banks, that was up next, with its separate loop starting much in the same way with hard, gravely trails.\n\nThe Bilsteins were immediately missed — especially by Cars.com videographer and backseat passenger Max Bednarski. The overall capability, however, wasn’t far off the top Badlands, with both trims having the same tires and twin-clutch rear differential. This was a less intense route, though, with only a single instance of three-wheel seesawing providing a challenge beyond point-and-shoot driving.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ford Bronco Sport Gets Dirtier With Off-Road Package, More Tech\n2024 Ford Bronco Sport Free Wheeling Review: An Acquired Taste\n2023 Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport Heritage Editions: Celebrating Pony History\nFord Recalls 272,000-Plus Bronco Sports, Mavericks for Failing Battery\nShop for a 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Near You\n2025 Ford Bronco Sport | Cars.com photo by Melissa Klauda\nShould You Buy a Bronco Sport Sasquatch?\n\nGreat little adventure vehicles, these. The Bronco Sport is already one of Ford’s more popular vehicles, but it’s almost a shame Land Rover isn’t still under the automaker’s purview — a Bronco Sport rebadged as a Discovery Sport would do crazy numbers.\n\nSeriously, unless you find yourself in situations necessitating low-range 4WD and locked differentials, I reckon a 2025 Ford Bronco Sport with the Sasquatch Package to be all the SUV you’ll need. And that is about the highest praise I can bestow on a unibody AWD compact SUV.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Ford Bronco Sport Free Wheeling is a great choice for shoppers scared of the future: With retro driving manners, dated but effective interior tech, and a stripe-heavy appearance package that pays homage to big vehicles of the 1970s, it’s not for everyone — but if it is for you, it won’t disappoint.\n\nVersus the competition: With more trucklike driving manners (and fuel economy), the Bronco Sport stands apart from other compact SUVs, including its Escape sibling. Those looking for a tall-riding hatchback, however, would be better served by an Escape or one of its competitors.\n\nThe Ford Bronco Sport debuted as a 2021 model, and for 2024, the big news is the addition of a new Free Wheeling trim level, which is essentially just a retro-themed appearance package on the base Big Bend trim.\n\nOn the outside, the Bronco Free Wheeling wears stripe decals on the hood and sides. It has a standard two-tone black roof, plus silver, white and red front and rear badging. It rides on trim-specific 17-inch black-painted wheels with red accents. Inside, sunset-themed seat inserts, color-coordinated stitching and red trim complete the look. It’s a nod to the Free Wheeling (or Free Wheelin’) truck, SUV and van models of the 1970s.\n\nRelated: 2025 Ford Bronco Sport Gets Dirtier With Off-Road Package, More Tech\n\nWe drove a 2024 Bronco Sport Free Wheeling to see if the SUV is just as good now as we thought it was when it debuted. Our test vehicle rang in at $37,695, with options including Ford’s CoPilot 360 Assist Plus, a towing package and the Convenience Package, which adds wireless device charging, heated front seats, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, rear parking sensors and LED foglights. On one hand, that feels like a lot for what is essentially a base model with a few options, but in today’s market, it’s fairly affordable.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nBasic Interior\n\nAt any trim level, but especially a lower one like the Free Wheeling, the Bronco Sport has a very basic-feeling interior. The seats are upholstered in cloth and hard surfaces abound. Like Ford’s Maverick pickup truck, though, the Bronco Sport has visually interesting interior trim — especially the Free Wheeling’s red accents — that make things look a bit more upscale.\n\nAn 8-inch touchscreen running Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system is standard across all trims. It looks small — especially compared with the 13.2-inch touchscreen available in the Escape — and Sync 3 is multiple generations behind other Ford models. The older technology adds to the Bronco Sport’s dated feel inside, but, to Ford’s credit, Sync 3 remains easy to use and retains physical controls for audio and climate functions.\n\nInterior room is better up front than in back; a low rotary gear selector saves vertical space and makes the cabin feel more open. In the backseat, head and shoulder room are both excellent, but legroom is in short supply. Seat comfort also left me wanting both front and rear, with overly firm cushioning that made longer trips more tiring.\n\nOne useful and increasingly rare feature is the Bronco’s dual-access liftgate. You can either lift up the entire thing (it’s not powered) or open up just the rear glass for reach-in access. Being able to access the cargo area without spilling out items — and carrying longer cargo without having to open the entire liftgate — is a nice nod to the outdoorsy kind of shopper that Ford is targeting. The liftgate also opens up to expose a built-in bottle opener, which might make you the savior of a campout or tailgate.\n\nMostly Pleasant Driving\n\nThe Bronco Sport’s on-road manners are good, but they’re not as carlike as other compact SUVs. Steering feel is fairly boosted, but it’s communicative enough for something in this class. Ride quality and comfort are good. Sharper turns highlight what feels like a higher center of gravity than other compact SUVs, but the Bronco Sport never felt like it was going to tip over.\n\nThe driving experience is aided by the Bronco Sport’s excellent outward visibility, which both makes off-roading easier and improves daily driving on-road. While the hood seems large, contributing to a driving feel you’d expect from a larger vehicle, drivers will have excellent views of all four corners.\n\nA 181-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine powers all trims but the Bronco Sport Badlands, which gets a 250-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The base engine is peppy and responsive enough for driving around town, but it can run out of power at highway speeds, necessitating more careful planning for merging and passing. Adding to the trucklike feel is trucklike fuel efficiency; the three-cylinder Bronco Sport is rated 25/29/26 mpg city/highway/combined, or 21/26/23 mpg with the four-cylinder. That trails the AWD three-cylinder Escape’s 26/32/28 mpg rating and the top-selling Toyota RAV4’s 27/33/29 mpg rating, which comes with a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder and AWD.\n\nShould You Get a 2024 Bronco Sport Free Wheeling?\n\nIf you like the looks of this appearance package, absolutely. I, however, found it to be far too excessive for my tastes; I felt more self-conscious driving this than I did in a robin’s egg-blue Fiat 500 cabriolet with paint-matched wheels. I was so self-conscious, in fact, that I chose to pick up online orders in-store rather than having them brought out to the car, but those are my tastes; they may not be yours.\n\nThe good news for shoppers who feel like I do is that the Bronco Sport Free Wheeling doesn’t have any features that aren’t available in other versions of the Bronco Sport. In fact, a similarly equipped Bronco Sport Big Bend costs thousands of dollars less than the Free Wheeling. Even after adding a $1,750 Black Appearance Package, which adds a black roof for a two-tone look, the base model is still more affordable than the Free Wheeling. The beauty of the Bronco Sport is that shoppers have a lot of options to configure the one they want.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Ford Bronco Sport Embraces Free Wheeling Spirit\n2023 Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport Heritage Editions: Celebrating Pony History\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Ford Bronco Sport?\nHow Does the 2021 Bronco Sport Badlands Handle the City?\nShop for a 2024 Ford Bronco Sport\nShould You Get Any 2024 Bronco Sport?\n\nThis is a trickier question. While the 2025 Bronco Sport was just announced with a host of updates that address some of my interior issues, we don’t yet know pricing for it. Like the recently refreshed Maverick compact pickup, the 2025 Bronco Sport will have a standard digital instrument panel and a 13.2-inch touchscreen with Ford’s Sync 4 operating system. This should make the cabin feel much more modern and a bit more upscale, but Sync 4’s reliance on touchscreen controls for many climate functions is not our favorite approach. The other major change that might affect shoppers’ decision-making is the addition of a Sasquatch off-road package that should significantly improve the Bronco Sport’s off-road capabilities.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see if the 2025 Bronco Sport’s price significantly jumps over the 2024 model — despite its carryover powertrains — before we can make a thorough determination. But if you’re less worried about interior technology and don’t care about going off-road, you may be able to find a great deal on a 2024 Bronco Sport soon.\n\nIf you’re interested in a more rugged, rough-around-the-edges compact SUV experience, the Bronco Sport is definitely worth your time. For a more carlike experience and thrifty fuel economy, look to the competition.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford Bronco Sport?\n\nThe 2023 Ford Bronco Sport is a five-seat SUV with a hint of the throwback design found on its bigger sibling, the Bronco. Powering the standard Bronco Sport is a turbocharged three-cylinder engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Optional is a 250-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder that adds considerably more pep when quick acceleration is needed.
