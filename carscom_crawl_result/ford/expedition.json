      "expert_review": "By dimensions and purpose, the 1997 Ford Expedition falls somewhere between affordable housing and the next Trailways bus to Yuma.\n\nLet’s bring perspective to the incredible bulk of this sumo-utility: It weighs close to 3 tons, which is about the same as a medium bull elephant or four beached baby whales. Or three Toyota Tercels. It has seats for nine adults, and that’s one guy shy of two Laker lineups.\n\nAt 6 feet, 5 inches, the Expedition is taller than Pete Sampras; at 17 feet, it’s long enough to overlap parking meters. One Expedition can tow a Range Rover as a spare. With rear seats folded, there’s sufficient cargo room for a lounge act.\n\nAs impractical as all this girth and tonnage appear, American buyers have been showing significant interest in jumbo sport utilitiessince the 1950s. In the late ’60s, Chevrolet welded a station wagon body to a truck frame and called it a Suburban, because it took up more room than most suburbs.\n\nThe intent of such monsters today is not simply to be bigger, sportier and more utilitarian than sport utilities. Nor are manufacturers guilty of pandering to faux outdoorspersons who might want to look rougher, tougher and ride taller than the urban cowboy next door.\n\nNo. The aim was to carry this full-size segment to the ultimate with purpose-built vehicles whose major purpose would be to hold enough gear for a Boy Scout jamboree, tow the heaviest boats and Airstreams trailer laws allow, and haul enough horses for Clint Eastwood’s next western.\n\nSomebody must have been thinking sagely, because annual sales of big and bigger are climbing above 300,000, and that’s expected to double in the next three years.\n\nHence Ford’s Expedition–a new bruiser serving unmistakable notice that it’s time for GM’s aging Suburban, and the younger Tahoes and Yukons, to move aside and let a wider, taller, more sophisticated vehicle in the game.\n\nAnd as a 47-journalist jury has already named Expedition North America’s Truck of the Year–beating out six comers, with Dodge Dakota and Toyota RAV4 the closest finalists–it seems likely Ford’s entry is poised to whip through the competition like Indiana Jones.\n\nBuilt to replace the Bronco, and based on the platform and powertrain of Ford’s F-150 pickup, this is a huge vehicle of small miracles. It handles no floppier than a Ford Explorer.\n\nThere is absolutely no sense of driving something large enough to fill the public transportation needs of small towns. And thanks to a choice of two V-8s–a standard 4.6-liter producing 215 horsepower and a lustier 5.4-liter pumping out 230 horsepower–an Expedition is not only capable of getting out of its own way, but it posts performance numbers close to those of a mid-size sedan.\n\nOh, there are downsides. Drive an Expedition into the garage of an older tract home and its butt will be bare to passing birds. It’s a thirsty rascal that motors only 13 city miles on a gallon of 87 octane. And with a 30-gallontank, that translates to about $40 a fill-up.\n\nStanding almost 9 inches off the ground, plus the width of the threshold, getting in and out–despite optional running boards–is a clamber and a tumble. The vertically challenged may consider buying ropes, carabiners and pitons.\n\nThe rear lift gate definitely is built for those with big, leathery paws and the upper-body strength of a lowland gorilla. And when King Kong is done with the rear door, ask for his help in removing the optional rear bench, which weighs 72 pounds and has about the same cuss factor as wrestling a large sofa intoa small apartment.\n\nStill, the Expedition wasn’t designed to be all things to the broadest range of users. There are shorter, lighter, more manageable Grand Cherokees and Isuzu Rodeos for small families who camp, commute, ski, carry a fortnight’s groceries and take the dog to Francile’s. Also a vast crop of friendlier, le s expensive vans for those who car pool, spend weekends at Home Depot and transport flurries of fourth-graders to school.\n\n*\n\nThe Expedition was built as an XXL hod on wheels for Alaska, Texas, Montana and similar Marlboro countries. It offers 118 cubic feet of cargo space, or five times the trunk space of a Buick Regal. The payload is 2,000 pounds, and that is close competition for full-size trucks. With a towing capacity of 8,000 pounds, it will out-pull everything but the slower, heavier, torquier, heavier-horsepowered Chevy Suburban.\n\nAnd it plays well off-road, thanks to Control Trac with settings aimed at all surfaces and weathers. Controlled by a dashboard-mounted rotary switch, there’s rear-wheel drive in high for standard work; all-wheel drive with traction taming for when the Ventura Freeway has flooded its verges; and locked, four-wheeldrive, with low-gear modes tough enough to tug Dodger Stadium back to Brooklyn.\n\nYet, in addition to being a loyal and hard worker, the Expedition offers surprising levels of refinement, drivability and creature comforts. There’s leather armchair seating, front and rear heating and air-conditioning, an audiophile’s sound system with rear-seat controls, and a battery saver that turns off forgotten electric systems–say, cargo lamps or interior lights–40 minutes after the ignition has been shut down.\n\nExpedition pricing, equipment and model range is aimed at all purposes and pockets. Two-wheel drivers with fabric upholstery and the smaller engine start at $28,000. Then, by leaps and bounds, engine size and optional luxuries, the sticker bloats to $40,000 for a 4WD Eddie Bauer model with everything but Eddie himself managing the roadside assistance program.\n\nWe found only two areas of absolute dislike. At really low speeds, the speed-sensitive steering is oversensitive and handling becomes an unfeeling waffle. And a handsome front end is marred by a styling crease that runs the width of the grille and looks like your first parking ding.\n\nIf there are facets we truly adore, they center on the Expedition’s poise and personality. It’s built like a brick condo, but handling is soft and effortless. Despite its bulk, it doesn’t have the visuals or presences of a bulk mobile.\n\nKinda like Paul Bunyan at the Ritz.\n\n1997 Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer model\n\nThe Good: A hulking hogan on wheels, huge and capable, yet very sophisticated for its size. Carries, tows and traverses beyond levels set by most of the competition.\n\nThe Bad: Pray there isn’t another gas drought. Speed-sensitive steering too sensitive at slow speeds. Lift gate brings out clumsiness in anyone.\n\nThe Ugly: Styling groove across grille.\n\nCost Base: $33,875. (Includes dual air bags, four-speed automatic, four-wheel drive with Control Trac, 17-inch wheels, air conditioning, anti-theft system, power windows and doors, a nti-lock brakes, premium sound system, leather seating surfaces and captain’s chairs in front.) As tested, $38,335. (Adds cast aluminum wheels, lighted running boards, tow hooks, CD changer, Owl all-terrain tires, front and rear air conditioning, towing package, third row bench seat, destination and delivery charges.)\n\nEngine 5.4-liter, V-8 developing 230 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, four-wheel drive, nine-passenger, full-size sport utility.\n\nPerformance 0-60 mph, as tested, with automatic, 10.7 seconds. Top speed, manufacturer’s estimate, 106 mph. Fuel consumption, estimated, city and highway, 13 and 17 mpg.\n\nCurb Weight 5,400 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s full-size sport utility vehicle debuted as a 1997 model and is built off the F-Series pickup chassis. The Lincoln Navigator is the Expedition’s luxurious corporate twin and offers a more powerful engine, standard leather upholstery and some convenience features not offered on the Expedition.\n\nInterior\nThe 1999 Expedition and Navigator were the first production vehicles available with power-adjustable pedals, a feature that allows moving the pedals over a three-inch range to accommodate shorter drivers. For 2000, the adjustable pedals are standard instead of optional.\n\nSeats for six are standard on the XLT model. New this year are optional captain’s chairs for the middle row, replacing a split-bench seat. Dual front captain’s chairs are standard on the Eddie Bauer model and optional on the XLT. The Eddie Bauer version also comes with a removable three-place rear bench for nine-passenger capacity, a feature optional on the XLT.\n\nExterior\nAvailable only in four-door styling, the Expedition has a rear liftgate with a window that opens separately. Though the Expedition has a different grille and front-end trim, it shares major styling cues with the F-Series pickup.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo engines are available. A 215-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 is standard on all models except the 4WD Eddie Bauer, which comes with a 260-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8. The latter is optional on other models. Two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive models are available. The 4WD system engages automatically and can be used on smooth, dry pavement.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats will be offered as an option later in the model year. Also coming later in the year is the Reverse-Sensing System, which detects objects while the vehicle is backing up. The system, also used in the Ford Windstar minivan, alerts drivers that objects behind the vehicle are within 5.9 feet with warning beeps. As objects become closer, the beeps sound more frequently and become a continuous tone when the object is within 10 inches.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "New York City is a study in the delicate ballet of power that dances back and forth across the tiny island. From buildings to moguls, everything stands tall and powerful.\n\nThe lesson one perceives from the Big Apple is that we’re all power hungry. It doesn’t matter whether you’re trying to get across the intersection first or clawing your way up the corporate ladder. The fact is we all want more power.\n\nSo, Ford has upped the power on the Ford Expedition for 1999 — its single-overhead-cam V-8 for 1999. The standard engine, a 4.6-liter, sees its horsepower jump from 215 to 240 with torque rising from 290 to 293 foot-pounds. The 5.4-liter sees its rating jump from 230 to 260 horsepower with torque rising from 325 to 345 foot-pounds.\n\nBoth engines are teamed to a four-speed automatic transmission, but the 5.4-liter’s transmission is electronically controlled. All engines are teamed to Ford’s Control Trac, Ford-speak for all-wheel drive.\n\nOne can leave it in the automatic all-wheel-drive mode or it can be locked in four-wheel-drive high or low ranges. Expeditions also can be had as a 4×2. Trim levels include XLT and Eddie Bauer.\n\nGas mileage will take some getting used to. Learn to love your local gasoline retailer. EPA rating for the 5.4-liter with 4X4 drivetrain is a dinosaur-depleting 12 mpg city. A test drive of equal parts city and highway returned a sobering 13 mpg. The XLT has a 30-gallon tank. You do the math.\n\nFor a truck that’s only slightly bigger than a politician’s ego, this vehicle rarely seems that big. Getting into it means using the running board. Yet once in the lofty perch, one finds this steers and maneuvers with ease. You only become aware of its size when tossing it through corners. There’s body lean, although it’s well controlled. The ride is car-like supple. The cabin quiet. But, all the weight can be felt while threading through twisties.\n\nParking this mammoth also becomes an adventure, something to consider when taking this car into Philly or New York. My favorite garage in Philly (no I won’t tell you which one) wouldn’t accept it. Nor would a couple others. I finally found one that would, but it just barely cleared the rafters; the radio antenna banging along. It’s the most adventure vehicles of this type will see.\n\nBut that was the worst of it. There’s something about being in comfy chair-high seats, gliding along in comfort with a mammoth V8 under the hood. Just ask anyone who owns a big old American car.\n\nOf course, the throne in this royal chamber is fit for the power hungry. You look down at almost every other vehicle on the road, with a feeling that your truck is not too big. Others are too small. Visibility is good all-around, helped by substantial side mirrors. This helps you avoid running over Hondas. (Did you feel a bump?)\n\nOf course being power hungry, one needs comfort and coddling.\n\nThis means the usual assortment of tilt steering wheel, power drivers seat, Symphony Hal l-like sound system, automatic climate controls, lots of leather and the ubiquitous power mirrors/locks/windows.\n\nUnusual is power adjustable pedals. A dash-mounted toggle switch activates a 12-volt DC motor that moves the pedals a total of 3 inches forward or back. This allows shorter drivers to sit farther away from the steering wheel-mounted airbag.\n\nOther luxe-barge features include automatic headlamps, numeric keypad on the driver’s door, speed-compensated volume, and lots of room. This regal ride has a great set of middle seats, with headrests and adjustable shoulder belts. The rear set of seats sits slightly higher, although leg and head-room will suit children more than adults. That third row also impinges on cargo room, which is just average with seats in place. But tumble the second and third rows and there’s room to carry the spoils of war.\n\nAll of this has its price, but power always carries a stiff tariff. For $29,355, you can buy a base Expedition 4×2, while the test vehicle, an XLT is based at $32,185. Toss in gas mileage of 12 mpg city and 16 highway, and you’ll be glad that gas is cheap right now. The test drive returned 13 mpg in mixed use.\n\nOf course, we all like to think we’re Donald Trump, even if we’re more like Donald Duck. But this vehicle, with its powerful engine, smooth ride, good handling and copious space makes moving through traffic easier than building overpriced condos in Manhattan.\n\n1999 Ford Expedition XLT\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter SOHC V8\n\nTransmission: 4-speed electronic overdrive automatic\n\nTires: P255/70SR16\n\nStandard: Four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, fog lamps, part-time four-wheel-drive with auto-locking hubs, speed-sensitive power steering, roof rack, trailer harness; air conditioning, rear heat ducts; four-speaker AM/FM stereo with clock, power windows with driver’s express down, power point, power driver’s seat, variable intermittent windshield wipers, rear wiper, rear window defroster; center armrest with storage, dual airbags, power locks, floor mats.\n\nBase price, base model: $29,355\n\nBase price, test model: $32,185\n\nEPA rating: 12 mpg city, 16 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 13 mpg",

      "expert_review": "Love `em or hate `em, sport-utility vehicles (SUV) continue to be hot sellers. Manufacturers can’t make them fast enough. These big-tired, tall-standing trucks are so popular you might think everyone in suburbia has a second house out in the country.\n\nBut SUVs aren’t really about patrolling the wilds. They are appealing because of all the things they can do: haul wood from the lumberyard, carry the kids’ bikes or take the family on a vacation. For the most part, they have become, as Matt DeLorenzo of AutoWeek theorizes, today’s equivalent of the family station wagon that our parents drove. But they sit higher, hold more and look rugged.\n\nMost SUVs have four-wheel drive (4WD), although it is rarely engaged for anything more serious than a slippery driveway. So, one could ask, why pay for the extra complexity of four-wheel drive when it goes unused most of the time? Sure, it does give you peace of mind because you are no longer a hostage to winter weather, and you can tackle off-road trails should you want.\n\nBut let’s face it, 90 percent of the time most SUVs are driven in two-wheel drive (2WD), especially in a climate as moderate as ours. Why not just buy 2WD to begin with and save some money?\n\nA case in point. In late October I spent a few days vacationing with a two-wheel-drive Ford Expedition XLT. Not only was its $27,985 base price nearly $4,000 less than the same model with 4WD, but it rode smoother and used less gas than four-wheel drive.\n\nWe were headed to Colorado when the worst snowstorm in more than 20 years closed all the roads and forced us to head back east. It’s probably a good thing we weren’t driving a 4WD or else I would have ventured further into the storm, feeling invincible. As it was, we still encountered a few inches of snow in eastern Missouri, but the 2WD Expedition plowed on without a hitch.\n\nWhen the pavement was clear, we motored along at 70 mph and the Expedition felt more like a tall Town Car than a truck, despite the fact that it is built on the frame of the F-150 pickup truck. The 2WD model has coil springs at all four corners, whereas the 4X4 has torsion bars in front. A load-leveling rear air suspension comes with the trailer towing package, and that, too, smoothes out the ride very nicely.\n\nAfter three days of driving, I appreciated the Expedition’s plush ride and the ease with which it swallowed up hundreds of miles without breathing hard. Wind and road noise was moderate. The spacious bucket seats gave adequate support without making you feel as if you were riding in an orthopedic chair. The fold-down armrest on the inboard side was a good place to rest your elbow, and I knocked off 350 miles at a crack without feeling at all tired.\n\nIts substantial size is perfect for vacationing. With the back seat folded flat and the third seat removed there was 118.3 cubic feet of storage space, ample for carrying my bicycle upright along the side wall and still hav ing plenty of room for the dog’s bed, our luggage and an antique child’s wagon we unearthed from the garage of my wife’s parents.\n\nThe optional leather upholstery was appealing not only because of its nice aroma and soft touch but because it is easier to keep clean than cloth, which can stain.\n\nOur vehicle had the optional third-row seat, but taking advantage of the cargo space meant the third seat had to be removed and left at home in the garage. One person can take it out, but it really is a job for two. If the third seat folded into the floor, like the Dodge Durango, it would be a better solution to seating for eight.\n\nThe 4.6-liter, overhead-cam V8’s 215 horsepower provides adequate acceleration, considering that it has about two tons of weight to get moving. On the highway it barrels along at a good clip without seeming taxed unless you need to pass on a hill, when it feels a bit short of breath and needs a lot of throttle. The optional 5.4-liter engine has more ower, but is a bit thirstier. Unless you haul heavy loads a lot, the 4.6 is more than adequate.\n\nA few of the Expedition’s handy touches include:\n\nLighted running boards, a $435 option.\n\nMap pockets in both sides of the center console.\n\nAn overdrive switch built into the end of the shift lever.\n\nA rear power outlet on the front-seat console, plus two power outlets in the dash.\n\nMy experience with this 2WD Expedition showed that in most circumstances it does its job just as well as the 4WD model but at a more reasonable price. If you think carefully about how you actually use your sport-utility vehicle, your pocketbook may be better served by going this route.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $27,985. Options included the XLT trim package, running boards, rear heater/air conditioner, trailer towing package, leather captain’s chairs and third-row seat. The sticker price was $33,900.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: If you spend most of your time in city driving, why not consider two-wheel drive?

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNo major changes are in store this year for Fords full-size SUV, which is due for a face-lift in 2002. Expedition debuted for 1997 built on the F-Series pickup chassis. The Lincoln Navigator is a more expensive corporate twin with a more powerful standard engine, standard leather upholstery and some convenience features not available on the Expedition. Deep-tinted privacy glass is standard on all models, and an engine block heater is standard on models sold in cold-weather climates.\n\nExterior\nThe Expedition is a four-door wagon with a rear liftgate that has a window that opens separately. Though the Expedition has a different grille and front-end trim, it shares major styling cues with the F-Series pickup.\n\nWith an overall length of 205 inches, the Expedition is 6 inches longer than the Chevrolet Tahoe but nearly 21 inches shorter than the Ford Excursion.\n\nInterior\nSeats for six are standard on the XLT model, with three-place benches front and rear. A pair of front captains chairs is standard on the Eddie Bauer model and optional on the XLT. A removable three-place rear bench that gives the Expedition nine-passenger capacity is standard on the Eddie Bauer model and optional on the XLT. Two captains chairs are optional for the middle row in place of a standard split bench seat.\n\nPower-adjustable accelerator and brake pedals, which move through a 3-inch range, are standard. A rear-seat audio/video entertainment system is a new option for the Eddie Bauer version.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 215-horsepower 4.6-liter V-8 engine is standard on all models except the four-wheel-drive Eddie Bauer version, which comes with a 260-hp 5.4-liter V-8. The 5.4-liter is optional on other models. Two- and 4WD models are available. The 4WD system engages automatically and can be used on smooth, dry pavement.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags for the front seats are optional. A sonar-based Reverse Sensing System, which detects objects while the vehicle is backing up, also is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nExpedition matches up well with its closest rival, the Chevy Tahoe, though the Tahoe has greater towing strength (8,700 pounds vs. the Expeditions 8,000 pounds). This is still a big truck, but a comfortable, luxuriously furnished one. As with the Tahoe, however, the rear seat is better for kids than adults. Performance is more satisfying with the 5.4-liter V-8 engine, which doesnt use much more gas than the 4.6-liter.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFords second-largest full-size sport utility vehicle is getting a little elderly compared to the competition and is due for a face-lift, if not a full redesign, by early summer 2002. But it will see no changes for the 2002 model year.\n\nBuilt on the F-Series pickup truck chassis, the Expedition debuted for the 1997 model year. The Lincoln Navigator is a more costly and posh corporate twin, with a more powerful standard engine and some convenience features that are not available on the Expedition.\n\nExterior\nExcept for a different grille and front-end trim, the Expedition shares major styling cues with the F-Series pickup. The four-door Expedition has a 119-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 205.8 inches  6 inches longer than the Chevrolet Tahoe but nearly 21 inches shorter than Fords giant Excursion. The Expedition is 78.7 inches wide and stands more than 76 inches high in the two-wheel-drive model, which is 2 inches taller than models with 4WD. The rear liftgate contains a window that opens separately.\n\nInterior\nSeating for six occupants is standard in the Expedition XLT, with three-place benches in both the front and rear positions. Front captains chairs are standard in the step-up Eddie Bauer model and optional in the XLT. A removable three-place rear bench allows for a nine-passenger capacity in the Eddie Bauer and comes optional in the XLT. Twin captains chairs are optional for the middle row, in place of the standard split bench.\n\nStandard power-adjustable accelerator and brake pedals have a 3-inch range to suit shorter drivers.

      "expert_review": "Recovering from the second largest sugar coma of the year at my house (second only to Halloween), I extol the virtues of the chocolate covered marshmallow bunny. The ratio of chocolate to marshmallow is key. For me, a thin, slightly crunchy layer of chocolate over a smallish marshmallow bunny shape is perfect; not too much of either ingredient. C’mon, I know I can’t be the only one who ponders this and other Easter candy mysteries such as, who really eats the green colored marshmallow peeps, can I?\n\nConsidering the design of a car’s interior is similar to considering the proportions of chocolate to marshmallow in a marshmallow bunny. For instance, the ratio of wood-like elements to plastic is important; as well the number of colors that grace the interior. The 2007 Eddie Bauer Expedition gets the relationship just about right. I am a fan of the simple, modern, clean-line design that runs throughout the Ford product line. The Eddie Bauer trim kicks that up a notch (thanks, Emeril) with two-toned leather seats. Actually, the dark and light leather combination on the seats reminds me a bit of my beloved little marshmallow bunny. Yum.\n\nMy mouth is salivating and I have put the bunnies up on the highest shelf. I need to concentrate on the other family-friendly features of the 2007 Ford Expedition. One of my favorites is the enormous center console between the front seats. I can easily store my laptop and my cute spring pocketbook inside. Amazingly, I still have room to store a few other provisions. Once closed, the console sports four cup-holders, two for the front seat passengers and two more intended for rear occupants. Herein lies the trouble; unless my rear seat passengers are at least 5 feet tall and not strapped into booster or car seats, they will be hard-pressed to reach their own cups while the car is moving. Luckily, I ride with a front seat butler passenger (aren’t teenagers grand?) most of the time, so he can hand the drinks back to his siblings when they complain that they are dying of thirst (especially prevalent after indulging in Easter candy).\n\nI have to give props to Ford for designing some of the most kid-friendly seat belts around. The receptor is not droopy; it stands at attention, so a single little hand can buckle the belt without having to reach down with another hand (sometimes Mom’s) to hold the receiver still. I am sure I don’t need to tell you what a big difference that little “feature” makes in my life. Some other helpful features include the automatic tailgate and the push-button folding rear seats. Ford Expedition: Saving mothers from back pain every day.\n\nI love the roominess of the third-row seat. It sits up a little higher than the middle row but still has plenty of headroom. This seat is so big that I can actually fit three booster seats across. Can you say car-pool city?\n\nNow here is a caveat to that: After popping the head rests up into place, I have a very hard time seeing out of both the back window and the rear side windows. Actually, lack of visibility is a bit of a theme in this SUV. This vehicle is so big that I really worry when backing out of my driveway. My test car is equipped with back up sensors, but frankly, I would feel more comfortable with a backup camera as well. I am also a bit uncomfortable parking this car in a lot filled with other cars because I simply cannot clearly sense how far the vehicle extends in the front or the back. In a small lot, I have to do a 10-point turn in order to back out of my space and avoid hitting cars behind me. I hope someone is not waiting.\n\nThe Ford Expedition delivers what it promises, just like my chocolate-covered bunnies. It has the right ratio of luxury to toughness. The exterior styling is bold, the creature comforts are numerous and the utility is grand. As long as I know to be cautious about the lack of visibility and sheer size of the vehicle, I appreciate the Expedition’s place in the mom-mobile world.\n\n*For more information on the Ford Expedition and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Is the Ford Expedition a Good SUV?\n\nFord’s updated 2025 Expedition is meant for a new generation of families, ones more technology savvy and adventurous, and it excels in its mission to bring change to a staid vehicle class.\n\nHow Does the Ford Expedition Compare With Other Full-Size SUVs?\n\nIt’s more spacious than foreign-brand full-size SUVs and rides and drives better than domestic competitors, but its novel dash layout might turn off some buyers who don’t care for the new design aesthetic.\n\nIf we wait long enough, change comes for us all, and it seems that the Ford Expedition’s number is up in that regard. With the traditional buyers that made the Expo a smash hit 30 years ago now aging out of the market, Ford decided it was time to update its big full-size family SUV for a new generation of family use. And while the overall shape might look very similar to the outgoing model, the interior has been thoroughly rethought for the modern age — one where screens take precedence over styling, where connectivity and apps are a priority, and where getting well off the beaten path has taken on a new urgency. The 2025 Expedition’s radically new interior is sure to alienate traditional buyers, but it will certainly excite a new generation of Expedition owners. But how does it work? And does the Expedition’s new mission make sense?\n\nRelated: 2025 Ford Expedition: Split (Gate) Personality\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 Ford Expedition Cost?\n\nFor 2025, Ford has rejiggered the trims available on the Expedition, eliminating a lot of the lower-cost, lesser-contented trims in favor of a simpler lineup that comes very well equipped. Gone are the XL, XLT, Limited and Timberline trims; the lineup now consists of the base Active, upgraded Platinum, off-road Tremor and top-of-the-line King Ranch. All starting prices below include a stunning $1,995 destination fee; the Active, Platinum and King Ranch are all available in extended-length Expedition Max form for an additional $3,000.\n\nActive: $63,995\nPlatinum: $76,425\nTremor: $83,025\nKing Ranch: $85,650\n\nWith the elimination of the lower-priced trims, the entry price for a 2025 Expedition has jumped by more than $7,000; Ford says that this doesn’t really matter much, as most buyers tended to option up the base ‘24 Expeditions anyway. This new slimmed-down trim strategy reduces build combinations and options, improving profitability by reducing complexity. The Active trim comes with standard rear-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive; all other trims come with standard 4WD.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Ford Expedition Drive?\n\nI sampled a couple of versions of the Expedition on my 36-hour jaunt to Louisville, Ky., where the Expedition is built in a massive Ford factory alongside the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Super Duty pickups. I drove a standard-wheelbase King Ranch for an extended on-road test, a Platinum Max for a long highway jaunt and a Tremor for some significant off-roading. The common thread among all of them is the exceptional powertrain. The standard version of the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine makes 400 horsepower and 480 pounds-feet of torque, and it is more than adequate to get the Expedition flying with an accompanying roar when the go-pedal is pressed. In fact, that roar sounds nothing like a turbocharged V-6, but suspiciously like a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 … making us call shenanigans on Ford for piping in artificial engine sounds. But we’ll give their engineers a pass on this one because the engine delivers its power in a stunning rush that launches everyone back into their seats. The high-output version of this engine is standard in the Tremor and optional in the Platinum as part of a couple of packages, and while it boosts output to 440 hp and 510 pounds-feet of torque, it’s also highly unnecessary — the standard engine is beyond adequate.\n\nWhat it is not, however, is terribly efficient. My drive averaged between 15-21 mpg, depending on whether I was on highways or backroads, but overall, it’s still a thirsty powertrain. Two-wheel-drive models are EPA-rated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined, while 4×4 versions are rated 15/22/18 mpg, which is pretty much spot on for what we saw from the Expedition’s trip computer.\n\nThe automatic transmission bangs off shifts quickly and crisply, but you’ll find that it’s shifting a lot — it has 10 forward gears to play with, and it intends to play with them all. The ride quality is also exceptional on-road, especially if your Expedition is fitted with the continuously controlled dampers, Ford’s electronically controlled shock absorbers that do an excellent job of ironing out uneven pavement and isolating potholes. Steering feel is good, as well, with just the right amount of effort and feedback for a big SUV. You won’t be attacking canyon curves with eager enthusiasm in the Expedition, but you won’t be making your passengers sick due to a soft and wallowy suspension, either. The only part of the driving experience that gave me pause was the Expedition’s brakes — they’re incredibly sensitive and grabby in every version I tried, responding to slight presses with major responses. It takes a while to get used to them in order to drive smoothly.\n\nGoin’ Muddin’? Try the Tremor\n\nThe prior off-road version of the Expedition, the Timberline, was capable in its own way, but the new Tremor aims to improve upon that. Featuring real and proper underbody protection, chunky all-terrain tires on 18-inch wheels, an electronic locking rear differential, special off-road modes, a uniquely tuned suspension, cameras galore and a few other tricks that include one-pedal off-road driving, it’s built to go farther afield than prior versions of the Expo. And after driving it on a serious off-road course in rural Indiana just days after tons of rain had made everything slick and gooey, I can endorse its abilities in the muck.\n\nIt’s still a big SUV with all of the limitations that size can bring, like poor outward visibility, the inability to squeeze into super-tight spaces and bulk that just can’t be hidden. But Ford’s judicious use of strategic cameras to allow for forward and 360-degree visibility on the big screens are decidedly helpful. The extra power from the high-output version of the V-6 doesn’t really enter into the equation; off-roading in anything that doesn’t have a Raptor or TRX badge on it is usually done at lower speeds, where low-end torque and grip are better perks than outright power. The Tremor’s 3.73:1 final drive ratio and locking rear differential are much better features than the more powerful engine when out in the rough.\n\nBut just like the on-road trims of the Expedition that have one odd quirk (the grabby brakes), the off-road trim also comes with an oddity: The new shape of the Expedition’s steering wheel (it’s a flattened oval, or a “squircle” to some) makes off-roading a little unusual. Hand-over-hand motions feel odd, and rim-shuffling motions (you never want to hook your thumbs in the steering wheel when off-roading) are just as unusual, because whenever the wheel is slightly turned and you’re keeping your hands at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions, you’re suddenly holding a much narrower steering wheel than you were a moment prior. It’s not a deal killer by any means, but it will take some getting used to. But why does the Expedition even have such an oddly shaped steering wheel? Well, it kind of needs one …\n\nThat Radical New Interior\n\nBy far, the biggest change to the Expedition is its interior design. The new dashboard, center console and screens are a total departure from anything Ford has done in its truck lineup. Replacing the traditional gauge cluster behind the steering wheel is a 24-inch panoramic digital display located high up at the base of the windshield. A second 13.2-inch touchscreen located in the middle of the dash is your primary input means. With the steering wheel no longer a circle, you’re supposed to look over it instead of through it to see the panoramic display, much like the most recent Toyota Prius hybrid and bZ4X electric car. And just like in those Toyotas, some people will be fine with it, and some will not. Shorter drivers might find this new setup difficult to use, with the new panoramic screen cutting off some forward visibility. I personally had no problem with it and like having the screen high up in my field of view. It also eliminates the need for a head-up display, saving Ford some costs in the process.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the interior is subtly changed to help Ford cut costs. The company insists it’s just a design change aesthetic for a simpler, cleaner look, but consider what’s not here anymore: There are no buttons or switches for the headlights or steering-wheel adjustments. There are also no available massaging seats for front occupants. You adjust the steering-wheel position via touch-sensitive panels on the steering wheel, which activate corresponding icons in the digital display. The headlight controls are in the center multimedia screen. These are things that highlight how different the new Expedition is from the outgoing model, and even Ford recognizes that there’s going to be a learning curve for new customers to understand how to use it — there’s a Quick Tips app that gives you video tutorials, and dealers will be trained to show new buyers how to perform previously simple tasks. To Ford’s credit, however, none of these changes are really terribly complicated, and once you have a little practice with them, it shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThe new Ford Digital Experience is now in the Expedition, and it works as well here as it does in other vehicles I’ve sampled it in, such as the 2025 Ford Explorer. Like almost every other automaker it seems, Google has wormed its way into Ford’s infotainment system, and in the Expedition, it controls the voice command functions, mapping duties, peripheral app downloads and more. For full utilization, you must have a Ford Connectivity Package subscription — available either for a monthly fee or as a one-time, life-of-the-vehicle purchase (a one-year trial is included with the purchase of a new Expedition). The system uses Google Maps for native navigation, but you’re welcome to use your phone’s navigation functions through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. But to use the Wi-Fi hot spot or download apps directly to the SUV, that connectivity package is required.\n\n \n\nDigital changes aside, the Expedition is just as spacious and useful as ever — now perhaps more so with its nifty new Ford Split Gate rear end. Notice how all 2025 Expeditions have a black liftgate regardless of what color or trim the truck is? That’s because it’s split into two sections, like a BMW or Land Rover SUV. The upper part raises and lowers normally, but the lower section stays put unless you drop it. This is handy for opening the rear hatch on a slope so your 2-liter sodas or loose basketballs don’t roll out and onto the ground. The lower portion can also be used as a seating surface for tailgating, which further plays into the Expedition’s role as an all-around family funship.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ford Expedition Up Close: Changing With the Times\n2025 Ford Expedition: Which Trim Level Should You Buy?\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nWhich Cars Fit 3 Car Seats?\nShop for a 2025 Ford Expedition Near You\nUtility Don’t Come Cheap\n\nWhile the Expedition might be an outstanding all-around family truckster able to haul people, cargo and up to 9,600 pounds of trailer, it’s not going to be accessible to most families due to its cost. As previously stated, the Expedition gets a significant price bump for 2025, but the entry-level Active trim does come with significant standard equipment, especially in the safety department. The 360-degree camera system, front and rear parking sensors, lane-centering steering and more all are part of the truck’s standard equipment, and Ford says that BlueCruise hands-free cruise control will be present on nearly 90% of all Expeditions, should you decide you want to pay for its activation (it’s another subscription-based service).\n\nThe Expedition still works as well as it ever has, with a formidable combination of utility, luxury, comfort and power. Its new interior will likely appeal to a younger generation of (affluent) families who value technology more highly, and for these buyers, the new Expo might be just what they’re looking for. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2007 about the Limited 5.4L 4×4 version of the 2007 Ford Expedition. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nSomewhat lost in anticipation of Ford’s new Edge crossover is the fact that the automaker has redesigned the Expedition, its full-size SUV and onetime cash cow. While the big news (literally) may be the new extended-length version dubbed EL, Ford’s core regular-length Expedition gets new styling inside and out, a new six-speed automatic transmission and chassis modifications.\n\nThe net effect is a full-size SUV that delivers a driving experience that rivals — and in some ways bests — that of Chevrolet’s redesigned Tahoe. That’s high praise, and aside from spongy brake pedal feel, the Expedition offers poise and refinement that are truly world-class for a big SUV.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2007 Expedition’s most significant styling changes are in its front end, which has a new four-bar grille and more-angular headlights. The grille is available in chrome, but my test car’s was finished in black, like the rest of the car, making the Expedition look pretty intimidating (as if its hulking size weren’t enough). There’s a new hood with a pronounced power dome, and standard running boards help make the climb into and out of the SUV easier.\n\nThe Limited trim level has power-folding side mirrors, and a powered liftgate is newly optional. The base aluminum wheels measure 17 inches in diameter, but 18- and 20-inch rims are offered.\n\nRide & Handling\nI’ll admit I was a bit surprised by the Expedition’s exceptional ride quality. It goes without saying that you have to take corners with care in a vehicle like this, but body roll has been reined in fairly well. The Expedition’s four-wheel independent suspension — still uncommon in full-size SUVs — has been redesigned, and a rear automatic-leveling system is optional. My test model, a Limited 4×4, had the leveling system and rode firmly. It also felt very stable around town and on the highway, though it sometimes was a bit unsettled when making a quick lane change.\n\nThere’s no denying the Expedition is a large vehicle, but it’s pretty easy to get accustomed to its size. That’s saying something, as some of these behemoths can be nerve-racking to drive on the narrow streets around Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters. A significant contributor to the Expedition’s confidence-inspiring ways is its steering system, which allows the SUV to maneuver through parking garages and mall parking lots with relative ease. The steering wheel is teamed with a new variable-assist system that delivers direct, luxury-carlike response. The steering wheel itself is well isolated from bumps in the road and turns with impressive smoothness. Overall, the system delivers a better experience than the Tahoe, which has steering that’s less precise and more susceptible to shock from bumps in the road.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAll Expeditions are powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 300 horsepower and 365 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission replaces the previous four-speed automatic, and Ford says the new transmission improves performance and gas mileage. While the 2007 Expedition does weigh about 200 pounds more than its predecessor, the fuel savings are pretty modest: A two-wheel-drive Expedition has EPA-estimated fuel economy of 14/20 mpg (city/highway), while a 2006 version managed 14/19 mpg.\n\nFuel economy aside — since that’s not the main selling point of SUVs like the Expedition — the drivetrain moves this near-three-ton SUV rather well considering the weight it’s burdened with and the Expedition’s less-than-svelte dimensions. The new six-speed automatic is another plus; it never made a harsh shift during my weeklong test.\n\nNow if only Ford could give the Expedition better brake pedal feel. The all-disc brakes stop this SUV capably, but the Expedition’s brake pedal has the same spongy feel that plagues the smaller Explorer Sport Trac SUV/pickup truck.\n\nThe Inside\nFord says the outside of the Expedition draws inspiration from the automaker’s F-Series line of pickup trucks, and that theme continues in the cabin. The dash and center console don’t have the tightest of panel gaps, but everything feels solidly attached. The new dashboard is more angular than the one it replaces, and the plastic panels have nice graining and a low-gloss finish that lend an upscale appearance to the cabin. Less appealing is the tacky-looking faux wood trim on the dashboard, center console and doors. The Limited model has a leather-clad real-wood steering wheel, but I don’t understand why imitation wood trim takes the place of the real thing elsewhere, especially when you consider this trim level’s starting price approaches $40,000.\n\nSide body panels are inching ever higher on many of today’s cars and SUVs, which makes for increasingly shorter side windows — think Chrysler 300, Dodge Magnum and Hummer H3. While this technique creates a tough, stylish shape on the outside, it can also make for a claustrophobic cabin. The Expedition defies this trend, and I love the results. In the front- and second-row seats, your arms fall almost level with the bottom edge of the tall side windows, which makes for great side visibility to go along with the impressive forward and rear views afforded by the thronelike driving position.\n\nCloth seats are standard and leather is optional. The optional third-row seat is only available in vinyl. The Expedition’s leather front bucket seats have soft cushioning but are supportive enough for extended highway driving.\n\nThe second row can be either a 40/20/40-split bench seat or two captain’s chairs. There’s good legroom and headroom there for adults, and both seat types have reclining backrests. The middle section of the split-bench seat can slide forward 11 inches to make it easier to tend to a small child from the front seats.\n\nUnlike the Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia, where the third row is removable, the Expedition’s optional 60/40-split third row can fold flat into the floor when not in use. Power-folding operation for the third row is available. The Tahoe’s third row is best left for kids, but the Expedition’s can accommodate adults with ease. The outboard backrests, which are oddly sculpted to accommodate lowered head restraints when the seat is folded, might get irritating on a long trip, but this is a minor issue; seat comfort and roominess is otherwise good. Nice job, Ford.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Expedition five stars in its frontal crash test, based on driver and front passenger protection. Five stars is NHTSA’s highest rating for this particular test and represents a 10 percent or less chance of serious injury to front-seat occupants.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system that features Ford’s Roll Stability Control. RSC’s gyroscopic sensor is used to sense a possible rollover and can apply the stability system in an effort to bring the SUV under control. The second-row bench seat has a set of lower anchors and a top tether for each of its three seating positions.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWith all the seats up — including the optional third row — there’s 18.6 cubic feet of room for hauling cargo. That’s slightly more than a similarly configured Tahoe, but a little less than the Nissan Armada. The Expedition’s capacity jumps to 55 cubic feet with the third row folded, and 108.3 cubic feet (nearly identical to the Tahoe) if you fold the second-row seats.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the two-wheel-drive Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds, which is more than the maximum ratings for the Tahoe, Armada, Sequoia and Dodge Durango. I didn’t have a boat and trailer handy to test the Expedition’s towing prowess, but I’d be interested to hear from those who’ve pulled something with this SUV; send me an email with your trailer-towing comments.\n\nFeatures\nOptions include heated and cooled front seats, a navigation radio with a six-CD changer, Sirius Satellite Radio and a rear DVD entertainment system with an 8-inch overhead screen and two pairs of wireless headphones. The optional Convenience Package includes power-adjustable pedals and Ford’s Reverse Sensing System parking aid (which beeps if you get too close to objects behind you).\n\nExpedition in the Market\nVehicles like the Expedition have taken a hit recently as car shoppers are paying more attention to gas mileage and figuring out what level of capability they really need in a vehicle. We likely haven’t seen the last of this phenomenon, but there are still buyers out there whose needs can’t be met by one of the growing number of car-based crossovers. If a powerful full-size SUV is what you need to tow a boat or camper and still have room for the family and all their stuff, the Expedition seems more than up to the task.\n\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ford Expedition is a truck-based full-size SUV that can carry up to eight people. The SUV comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trim levels. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. There’s a longer version available, called the Expedition EL. It’s about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row of seats. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Expedition receives trailer-sway control standard, to help prevent trailer sway during towing.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. Regular- and extended-length Expeditions sport the same exterior styling.\n\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard power, heated mirrors\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\nOptional 18- or 20-inch wheels\nOptional power liftgate\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to nine occupants across three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor — a feature not offered in all competitors. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional on lower trims and standard on higher ones.\n\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional Sync multimedia system\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nOptional power-folding third row\nOptional navigation system\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, the Expedition comes only as a half-ton truck. The sole powertrain is now a flex-fuel engine that can run on E85.\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nOptional part-time four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension\n\nSafety\nThe Expedition has not been crash-tested by our preferred source, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores five stars in government front-crash tests, which is the highest rating possible. A new trailer-sway control feature is standard and works in conjunction with the electronic stability system to detect trailer movement and apply braking, as well as reduce engine torque to keep the vehicle in control. A standard MyKey system allows parents to impose vehicle restrictions on teen drivers. Parents can limit the vehicle’s top speed, add a persistent seat-belt reminder, limit the volume on the stereo to 44 percent of its maximum volume, and have a speed chime activate at 45, 55 or 65 mph.\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard MyKey\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system with anti-rollover technology\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS Post-Crash Alert System\nStandard trailer-sway control\nOptional rearview camera",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Big SUVs used to be all the rage — just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs do the same to those vans in the 1990s. But since then, the Great Recession and gas price shocks have returned big SUVs to their original place in the market — expensive specialty vehicles bought by people for whom only a big, multi-passenger vehicle that can tow significant amounts will do.\n\nRelated:  2018 Ford Expedition Review Video\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe segment leader is the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and it wasn’t hard to figure out why — the main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade. All that has changed — behold the behemoth, the all-new 2018 Ford Expedition, that’s aiming to knock the Chevy off its top truck throne.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains a traditional truck-style body-on-frame construction. Underneath, the Expedition is an F-150 with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower loading floor in the cargo area that enables the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s style of seats.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLike the F-150, the body is now aluminum, but the weight difference isn’t that significant — Ford has added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that offsets some of that aluminum construction benefit. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that is much more in keeping with the modern style of truck — high beltline, smaller windows and a chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one is available in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max. The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space but does increase the available cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between those extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. It’s a carryover engine from the last Expedition, so it shouldn’t be a surprise to not see a V-8 under the hood. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum trim. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission, available to either a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configuration, and an electronic limited slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6, and it sounds for all the world like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine, otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of turbos whooshing and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it sits in.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — it more than adequately powers the Expedition in either regular-wheelbase or Max versions, and gets even more punchy when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exuded confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up the steering feedback, and changes both the throttle mapping and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18- to 22-inch models depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but even lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride. There are no crazy tippy body motions — it’s clear the Ford ride and handling engineers have done their homework. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered here too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a two-speed low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nThe Expedition also tows like a champ. Hooked up to a 5,500-pound horse trailer, the Expedition Max I drove chugged up 6 percent inclines with ease, able to accelerate despite the load it was hauling. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to this engine, holding gears on downhill grades that saved the Expedition’s brakes and maintained easy control. Trailer sway control comes with the heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back a trailer up using a special control wheel on the dash and the backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats remain oddly short and become unsupportive over longer voyages. The backseats are high with plenty of room, and fore-and-aft sliding ability allows the two rear rows of passengers to negotiate legroom among themselves. The third row is actually usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; put it forward a bit, and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of an electronic button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMaterial quality in the cabin is mixed, however. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in the segment; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t look like they flow together well. Some of this, like plastic mold flashing on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality (our test units were some very early examples), but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck at heart that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim or even top $70,000 in a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail becomes important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin. The new platform means that a fully updated electronic architecture is present, chock full of gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids, autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is the new B&O Play brand, and it sounds fantastic. The entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models, and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness, and amenities.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-sized SUV in a while, you’d better be sitting down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination and delivery, but you’ll never see one of those on a dealer lot — those are meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments. Far more likely is the XLT trim, which starts at $52,890 in 4×2 trim. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,100 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get, and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop short of 90 grand. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000, and can top out around $100,000.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStill, this is easily competitive with vehicles like the Chevy Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. With buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs vanquish those vans in the 1990s. Since then, however, the Great Recession and occasional gas price shocks have returned the largest SUVs to their original role in the market: expensive vehicles bought by people who need big, multi-passenger vehicles that can tow a lot of weight. The segment leaders are the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer sibling, the Suburban, and it isn’t hard to figure out why: Their main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade.\n\nNow all that has changed. Behold the behemoth: an all-new 2018 Ford Expedition that aims to knock the Chevy off its top-truck throne — as it did in our Full-Size SUV Challenge.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains traditional, trucklike body-on-frame construction. Under the skin, the Expedition is an F-150 enhanced with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower load floor in the cargo area, enabling the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s seats, which fold flat but not into the floor. The Tahoe’s raised floor eats into cargo space and makes it more difficult to load objects.\n\nLike the F-150, the Expedition’s body is now aluminum, but the weight difference for 2018 isn’t that significant — just a 119-pound decrease for the base trim versus a comparable 2017 Expedition. Ford added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that serve to offset some of the benefit of lightweight aluminum. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that’s much more in keeping with the modern style of truck: high beltline, smaller windows and chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Expedition comes in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max (formerly Expedition EL). The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space, but it does increase the cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity. My primary test vehicle was a regular-length Expedition, though Cars.com editors have also driven the Max.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a carryover engine. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission — available with either rear- or all-wheel drive — and an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6 and it sounds like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated through the stereo (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of whooshing turbos and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it powers.\n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — the V-6 more than adequately powers the Expedition in both regular and Max versions, and it gets even punchier when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exudes confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up steering feedback and changes both accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18 to 22 inches depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride, as well; there are no crazy, tippy body motions. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered there, too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nHooked up to a 5,500-pound camper, my Expedition towed like a champ, chugging up 6 percent inclines with ease, accelerating despite the load it hauled. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to the engine, holding gears on downhill grades to save the Expedition’s brakes and maintain easy control. The instrument panel also shows you tons of information, such as which gear the transmission’s in at any given time.\n\nTrailer sway control comes with a heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back up a trailer using a dedicated rotary knob on the dash and backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nWhere the Expedition falls short is in fuel economy, especially when towing. It also features a smaller gas tank than its main competition, meaning its overall range is notably shorter. The regular Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. The longer Expedition Max clocks in at 17/23/19 mpg with 2WD, 16/21/18 mpg with 4WD. In a recent real-world test for the Full-Size SUV Challenge, my Expedition 4WD achieved 21.5 mpg in combined driving, better than its 19 mpg rating. But that number dropped dramatically to 10.2 mpg when towing a camper — a steeper loss than the V-8-powered competitors in our Challenge exhibited, though still not the lowest mpg. Turns out that the twin-turbocharged engines positively suck down the petrol when you put the engine under some serious load, as I did up and down the hills of eastern Arizona. Combine that with the smaller gas tank, and you’ll be making frequent pit stops if you’re towing a trailer cross-country.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats feel unsupportive over longer voyages. One of our taller reviewers could not get comfortable, with his legs always at an angle and most of his thighs unsupported by the oddly short bottom cushions. The backseats are high, with plenty of room, and the ability to slide fore and aft means passengers in the two rear rows can negotiate legroom amongst themselves. The third row is usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; slide it forward a bit and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of a button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\nMaterials quality in the cabin is mixed. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in its own class; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t flow together well. Some of this, like plastic molding seams on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality, but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim and even top $70,000 for a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail is important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin, including gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big-screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids and autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is by the new B&O Play brand, a division of Bang & Olufsen, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nThe entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models on many levels and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness and amenities.\n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-size SUV in awhile, you’d better sit down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination charges, but you’ll never see that price on a dealer lot — they’re meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments.\n\nFar more likely to be found is an XLT trim, which starts at $52,985 with two-wheel drive. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,000 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop just short of 85 grand.\n\nMy regular-length Limited 4×4 model stickered at $72,655 including destination, and that included several popular equipment packages and leather for the first and second rows. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000 and can top out around $100,000.\n\nStill, the Expedition’s price is easily competitive with vehicles like the Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. It comes in at a bit more than the Nissan Armada, but it’s a significantly larger vehicle with a much bigger interior. It’s comparable in size to the Toyota Sequoia but has far surpassed that old, outdated model. It’s more refined, with a much nicer interior and a multimedia system that’s at least two or three generations more current.\n\nWith buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Ford Expedition is a truck-based, full-size SUV that can carry up to eight people. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. A longer version, called the Expedition EL, is about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2012\nSpotter mirrors integrated into the side mirrors to show blind spots are now standard, and Limited and King Ranch models gain standard front park assist.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. Regular- and extended-length Expeditions sport the same exterior styling. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard heated mirrors\nStandard 17-inch wheels\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\nOptional 18- or 20-inch wheels\nOptional power liftgate\n\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to eight in three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional. The Expedition EL comes with a cargo organizer that divides the space to suit what is being carried. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard auto-dimming rearview mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional Sync multimedia system\nOptional heated and cooled front seats\nOptional power-folding third row\nOptional navigation system\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, which are available with heavy-duty payload ratings, the Expedition comes only as a regular-duty, half-ton truck. The sole powertrain is a flex-fuel engine that can run on E85. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nStandard rear-wheel drive; optional four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension\n\nSafety\nA trailer-sway control feature is standard and works in conjunction with the electronic stability system to detect trailer movement and apply braking, as well as reduce engine torque, to keep the vehicle in control. A standard MyKey system allows parents to impose vehicle restrictions on teen drivers. Parents can limit the vehicle’s top speed, add a persistent seat-belt reminder, limit the volume on the stereo to 44 percent of its maximum volume and have a chime activate at 45, 55 or 65 mph. A backup camera is optional. Standard safety features include:\n\n\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system with anti-rollover technology\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTrailer-sway control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ford Expedition is a ladder frame full-size SUV that can carry up to nine people. The SUV comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trim levels. It competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Toyota Sequoia and Dodge Durango. There’s a longer version called the Expedition EL. It’s about 15 inches longer and has a standard third row of seats. It competes with the Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nNew for 2009\nFor 2009, the Expedition receives a standard flex-fuel V-8 engine and can get Ford’s Sync voice-activation system.\n\nExterior\nThe front features a squared-off four-bar grille and angular headlights, and the rear window can open independent of the liftgate. At 206.4 inches long and 78.8 inches wide, the Expedition is the longest of the group, though the Tahoe and Sequoia are wider. Regular-length and extended Expeditions sport the same exterior styling. At 221.3 inches long, the Expedition EL is about the same size as the Suburban.\n\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable power liftgate (standard on Limited and King Ranch)\nStandard capless fueling system\nStandard fog lamps\nStandard exterior keypad system\nStandard power heated mirrors\nOptional rain-sensing wipers (standard on Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional power running boards\n\nInterior\nThe Expedition can seat up to nine occupants across three rows of seats. The steering wheel, gauge clusters and climate controls are similar to those in Ford’s F-150 pickup truck. Thanks to an independent rear suspension, the third-row seat folds flat into the floor — a feature not offered in all competitors. A power-folding mechanism for the third-row seat is optional on lower trims and standard on higher ones. With the second- and third-row seats folded, the Expedition’s maximum cargo capacity is 108.3 cubic feet, which is about equal with most of the class, though the Sequoia beats all other competitors by a bit. The Expedition EL offers 130.8 cubic feet of volume, which is just a tad smaller than the Suburban’s space (137.4).\n\nStandard auto-dimming mirror\nStandard power locks and windows\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel\nStandard Ford Sync (optional on XLT)\nAutomatic climate control (Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional power-folding third row (optional on XLT)\nOptional GPS navigation system (Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch)\nOptional DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen properly equipped, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds. Unlike the Tahoe and Suburban, the Expedition comes only as a half-ton truck. The 2500-series three-quarter-ton Chevys come with larger engines and higher towing and hauling capacities. The sole powertrain is now a flex-fuel system that can run on E85.\n\nStandard 310-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with 365 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nAvailable rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive\nOptional load-leveling air suspension system\n\nSafety\nThe Expedition has not been crash tested by our preferred source, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scores five stars in government frontal-crash tests, which is the highest rating possible.\n\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability control with antiroll mitigation\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS-Post Crash Alert System\nAvailable rearview camera (standard on Limited and King Ranch)",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2015 about the 2015 Ford Expedition. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nUpdates to the 2015 Ford Expedition create one of the nicest-driving big SUVs ever, but the disappointing lack of cosmetic updates means few people are likely to notice.\n\nBig SUVs used to be the de facto choice of families all over the U.S. Able to haul massive amounts of stuff, or most of a basketball team, their V-8 power and four-wheel drive made them the ultimate wagons — all-weather, modern Conestogas that can haul boats and broods across the country.\n\nThat utility, however, came at a price — fuel economy, mostly, as the full-size SUV almost always came with a V-8 engine and thousands of pounds of steel to lug around. But times have changed, and the market has changed with them. Full-size SUVs are nowhere near as popular as they once were, having been relegated to the status of expensive specialty vehicle used primarily by people who specifically need their particular combination of hauling ability and cargo capacity.\n\nFord has just updated its Expedition, adding a slick electronic suspension and replacing the SUV’s ubiquitous V-8 engines with something new: a twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6. No V-8 engine is offered in the 2015 model (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here). GM is sticking with V-8s in its new Chevrolet Tahoe, so will this rather significant change affect the usability or desirability of Ford’s big SUV?\n\nExterior & Styling\nYour first thought upon approaching the 2015 Expedition will undoubtedly be: “Did I buy a 2014 by mistake?” The changes for 2015 are so subtle as to be almost irrelevant — it looks almost exactly the same as it has since its last full redesign in 2007. There is a new grille and lower bumper, and new headlights and taillights are present (now with more LEDs), but that’s the extent of things to talk about for the exterior. As before, the Expedition is available in two lengths, the Expedition and Expedition EL, but both versions seat eight people as standardly configured.\n\nParts of the Expedition’s body and greenhouse glass look as if they haven’t changed since 1999. Contrast that with the significantly changed and very attractive all-new 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevy’s longer Suburban, and the refreshed Expedition looks like a brand-new 10-year-old truck.\n\nHow It Drives\nThankfully, the Expedition most definitely does not drive like an older truck. In fact, it’s almost a pity Ford didn’t spend a little more coin on the cosmetic updates, as the changes to the chassis and powertrain have created a genuinely, dynamically impressive truck.\n\nPowering everything is a twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 that makes 365 horsepower, which is enough to get the Expedition moving with more urgency than you might expect from a V-6. Even with a V-8 no longer available, the Expedition doesn’t lose any of its towing or hauling ability — it just gains a little bit of fuel economy in exchange for those two cylinders. The tow rating for the Expedition goes up to 9,200 pounds when equipped with an optional towing package; it’s 6,500-6,600 pounds normally.\n\nMy test truck was equipped with Ford’s “continuous control suspension,” an electronic system that adjusts the shock absorbers to suit conditions or driver-selectable settings. It might seem odd to have a full-size SUV with a Sport mode for the suspension, but it actually works to keep the Expedition planted and better controlled. Feedback is still big-truck-vague, but it’s no longer numb and ponderous; the Expedition rides beautifully, handling pavement imperfections easily and quietly, giving just enough sensation through the steering wheel to boost confidence and control. Just be sure to keep the adjustable suspension in Normal or Sport modes; if you switch it to Comfort mode, be prepared for the motion of the ocean. In Comfort, the suspension goes squishy and the truck bobs over pavement undulations as if it has very poor body control. The brakes are firm and confidence-inspiring, bringing the big truck to a stop easily and with little drama.\n\nWith the switch from V-8 to turbo V-6 power, the EPA mileage estimates for the Expedition go up across the board, coming in at 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined for the two-wheel-drive model and 15/20/17 mpg for the four-wheel-drive Expedition. Opt for the larger, long-wheelbase truck, and your fuel economy suffers a little, coming in at 15/21/17 mpg for the two-wheel drive, 14/20/16 mpg for the four-wheel-drive EL.\n\nHere’s the kicker — the Ford is rated almost identically to the V-8-powered Chevrolet Tahoe, which in two-wheel-drive form gets 16/23/18 mpg. Two other V-8-powered full-size truck competitors, the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada, get considerably worse mileage: the two-wheel-drive Armada is rated 12/19/15 mpg and the two-wheel-drive Sequoia gets 13/17/15 mpg.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many others have reported from their experience with Ford’s EcoBoost turbocharged engines, I did not achieve the estimated ratings with my four-wheel-drive standard-length truck. My combined fuel economy — about half of which involved highway driving — netted just 15.6 mpg combined. While EPA estimates for the truck are higher, if there’s no actual benefit in measured everyday fuel economy, customers may be left wondering what the switch in powertrains achieves and what benefit the turbo six-cylinder really provides over GM’s advanced V-8. Thankfully, as mentioned before, the new engines sacrifice nothing in terms of drivability.\n\nInterior\nHopping up into the Expedition’s big, comfortable chairs is yet another step back in time. The interior looks about as unchanged as the exterior, with the exception of a new gauge cluster and center console screen and buttons. The plastic quality, trim cut lines, door panels, even the shape of the dash all look the same as the outgoing 2014 model — which sadly looked the same as the 2004 model.\n\nThankfully, it’s still comfortable in there, if not terribly modern. Seat comfort is fine in both front and back, with actual room in the third row for real human adults. Accessing the third row is also not terribly difficult, with second-row seats that tumble and fold and an optional power retractable step to help boost you up into the high-riding cabin.\n\nVisibility is excellent in all directions thanks to tall, upright windows and a high seating position that’s representative of the genre. While the overall interior is handily outclassed by the completely redone Chevy Tahoe, the Expedition is more comfortable thanks to a steering wheel that’s centered on the driver (unlike the Chevy) and a center console that’s not as wide or intrusive. If you’re looking for a slightly nicer interior (but only slightly nicer), the more expensive Lincoln Navigator offers better leather and a mildly more upscale interior, but its latest revision for 2015 suffers from the same issues as the Expedition — it’s not new or different enough from the outgoing model, and it’s handily outclassed by the Cadillac Escalade.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhat changes Ford did make to the Expedition’s interior came mostly in the form of electronic upgrades. The new gauge cluster brings familiar and useful information displays to the driver. The center console features easy-to-use buttons, but the touch-screen still seems a bit small given the massive real estate available for a larger unit.\n\nThe latest generation of Sync’s voice controls all seem to work quite well, however, which is a welcome change from versions sampled in previous years. Connection is still a bit of a challenge, however, and it takes a while after hooking up a personal music device before it’s fully usable. The rest of the switches and controls feel much like the rest of the truck — old.\n\nThe Expedition also did not get as extensive an electrical system redesign as the Tahoe did, meaning certain electronic systems — like adaptive cruise control and keyless remote entry with push-button start — are not available. Ford’s familiar door-mounted keypad is available, but it’s ancient tech and can be operated only while standing at the driver’s door. Again, a little extra money spent on the refresh would have gone a long way toward making the Expedition a lot more competitive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith the latest Tahoe redesign, Chevrolet has touted the truck’s new flat-folding third-row seats that disappear into the floor, but that’s a little misleading: Because of how the rear suspension is laid out on the Tahoe, true drop-down rear seats are not possible. A false platform makes it look like a flat floor, but the latest Tahoe loses several inches of vertical height in the process.\n\nThe Expedition has no such problem. Due to the truck’s independent rear suspension, the seats can fold flat into the floor, creating a lower liftover height and a true flat floor, front to back. This becomes evident when you compare interior cargo room: Despite being relatively similar-sized trucks (the Tahoe is a bit shorter), the Expedition features 18.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row of seats, while the Tahoe comes up with just 15.3 cubic feet. The Sequoia, meanwhile, brings 18.9 cubic feet to the party, while the Armada tops them all with 20.0 cubic feet. With all the seats down, the Expedition bests the Tahoe again: 108.3 cubic feet to the Tahoe’s 94.7 cubic feet, while the Armada features 97.1 cubic feet. They all pale in comparison, though, to the cavernous Toyota, which sports 120.1 cubic feet.\n\nIf you need more room, Ford and Chevrolet have bigger versions of their trucks available. The Expedition EL wins the interior size comparison with its bigger cargo area, which also translates into a bigger third row. Behind the third row, the Expedition EL offers 42.6 cubic feet of room to the Chevrolet Suburban’s 38.9 cubic feet. Keep the third row stowed, and the Expedition EL offers 85.5 cubic feet of cargo room, versus the Suburban’s 76.7 cubic feet. Fold the second and third rows, and you get 130.8 cubic feet of room in the Expedition, versus 121.1 cubic feet in the Suburban. Third-row seating is more capacious in the Expedition EL as well, with 4.5 inches more shoulder room and 3.2 inches more legroom than the third row in the Suburban.\n\nUsing the cargo area is easy, too, with a third row that features optional power folding, operated by two switches in a side panel. Big trucks like this are used for hauling people and stuff, often at the same time, and the Expedition simply excels at both.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test results are not yet available for the new Expedition, but one rating has been published — a rollover rating of three stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As the Expedition received only a mild upgrade to its electrical systems, blind spot detection is now available, but more advanced systems like forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are not. Those features are available on competitors like the Tahoe.\n\nIf you’re looking for more airbags, you’ll have to head to Toyota — the Sequoia offers additional knee protection airbags, whereas the Tahoe, Expedition and Armada do not. See the Expedition’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nFord’s Expedition is not a cheap truck, starting at $45,040 including destination fee for a two-wheel drive, standard-wheelbase XLT base model, or $47,750 for an extended EL model. Adding four-wheel drive bumps that price up $2,925 with either wheelbase. The Limited model, which adds items like Sync with MyFord Touch, rain-sensing wipers, a power liftgate, the power-folding third-row seat, dual-zone automatic climate control and 20-inch wheels, starts at $54,635 for the standard length Expedition or $57,287 for the EL. The King Ranch model is up next, but its changes are mostly cosmetic, with special leather, unique paint, halogen projector headlamps and painted exterior trim. It starts at $58,865 for the standard length, $61,515 for the EL.\n\nTopping the range is the new-for-2015 Platinum edition, which adds more luxurious leather and interior trim, standard power-retracting running boards and a 12-speaker Sony premium audio system for $59,825, or $62,475 for the EL. My test truck was a Limited, standard-length 4×4 with a few options, like the continuous control suspension and 22-inch wheels. It stickered for $61,815. Load an Expedition EL 4×4 Platinum up with every option, and you’ll nudge just more than $70,000. Build one your way here.\n\nAs expensive as that seems, it’s actually quite competitive given the slightly more expensive price tag for Ford’s cross-town Chevy rival. The Tahoe LS 4×2 starts at $46,745 — that’s nearly $2,200 more than the base Expedition XLT. The extended-wheelbase Tahoe is called the Suburban, and loading one up with all the options results in a truck that tops $77,000. It may cost a bit more, but the difference in interior quality and safety amenities versus the Ford makes up for that price difference, even if it is down a little on interior cargo capacity.\n\nThe old men on the block are the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada. The Sequoia starts at $45,320 for a 4×2 with the standard 5.7-liter V-8 and stretches up to more than $65,000 for a loaded 4×4 Platinum version. The Nissan Armada features much of the same kind of equipment as the Sequoia, but it’s considerably less expensive at every trim level. It starts at just $39,055 and tops out, loaded, at just more than $57,000. Both the Toyota and Nissan are more limited in their flexibility — each is available with only one length and one engine — and both feature interior appointments and electronics that are long overdue for an update.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nOffered in regular- and extended-length Max form, the Ford Expedition full-size SUV seats five people in two rows or up to eight people in three rows. It’s powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 375 or 400 horsepower depending on the trim level. The V-6 teams with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada. \n\n What’s New on the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nA new two-row XL trim level is now the base model, and a new STX Package features a five-bar grille, tri-zone automatic air conditioning and an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Ford Expedition Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPush-button start\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower running boards\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nPower-adjustable pedals with memory feature\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower third-row seat\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated second-row seats\nNavigation\nB&O premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nThe Expedition has plenty of capability — it’ll tow up to 9,300 pounds when properly equipped — and it offers lots of tech features. It’s roomy, rides well and has a powerful drivetrain, too. It can get pricey and towing disproportionately drags down fuel economy, but the Expedition is an impressive full-size SUV overall.",

      "expert_review": "Just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs vanquish those vans in the 1990s. Since then, however, the Great Recession and occasional gas price shocks have returned the largest SUVs to their original role in the market: expensive vehicles bought by people who need big, multi-passenger vehicles that can tow a lot of weight. The segment leaders are the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer sibling, the Suburban, and it isn’t hard to figure out why: Their main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade.\n\nNow all that has changed. Behold the behemoth: an all-new 2018 Ford Expedition that aims to knock the Chevy off its top-truck throne — as it did in our Full-Size SUV Challenge.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains traditional, trucklike body-on-frame construction. Under the skin, the Expedition is an F-150 enhanced with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower load floor in the cargo area, enabling the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s seats, which fold flat but not into the floor. The Tahoe’s raised floor eats into cargo space and makes it more difficult to load objects.\n\nLike the F-150, the Expedition’s body is now aluminum, but the weight difference for 2018 isn’t that significant — just a 119-pound decrease for the base trim versus a comparable 2017 Expedition. Ford added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that serve to offset some of the benefit of lightweight aluminum. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that’s much more in keeping with the modern style of truck: high beltline, smaller windows and chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Expedition comes in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max (formerly Expedition EL). The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space, but it does increase the cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity. My primary test vehicle was a regular-length Expedition, though Cars.com editors have also driven the Max.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a carryover engine. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission — available with either rear- or all-wheel drive — and an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6 and it sounds like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated through the stereo (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of whooshing turbos and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it powers.\n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — the V-6 more than adequately powers the Expedition in both regular and Max versions, and it gets even punchier when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exudes confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up steering feedback and changes both accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18 to 22 inches depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride, as well; there are no crazy, tippy body motions. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered there, too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nHooked up to a 5,500-pound camper, my Expedition towed like a champ, chugging up 6 percent inclines with ease, accelerating despite the load it hauled. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to the engine, holding gears on downhill grades to save the Expedition’s brakes and maintain easy control. The instrument panel also shows you tons of information, such as which gear the transmission’s in at any given time.\n\nTrailer sway control comes with a heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back up a trailer using a dedicated rotary knob on the dash and backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nWhere the Expedition falls short is in fuel economy, especially when towing. It also features a smaller gas tank than its main competition, meaning its overall range is notably shorter. The regular Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. The longer Expedition Max clocks in at 17/23/19 mpg with 2WD, 16/21/18 mpg with 4WD. In a recent real-world test for the Full-Size SUV Challenge, my Expedition 4WD achieved 21.5 mpg in combined driving, better than its 19 mpg rating. But that number dropped dramatically to 10.2 mpg when towing a camper — a steeper loss than the V-8-powered competitors in our Challenge exhibited, though still not the lowest mpg. Turns out that the twin-turbocharged engines positively suck down the petrol when you put the engine under some serious load, as I did up and down the hills of eastern Arizona. Combine that with the smaller gas tank, and you’ll be making frequent pit stops if you’re towing a trailer cross-country.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats feel unsupportive over longer voyages. One of our taller reviewers could not get comfortable, with his legs always at an angle and most of his thighs unsupported by the oddly short bottom cushions. The backseats are high, with plenty of room, and the ability to slide fore and aft means passengers in the two rear rows can negotiate legroom amongst themselves. The third row is usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; slide it forward a bit and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of a button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\nMaterials quality in the cabin is mixed. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in its own class; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t flow together well. Some of this, like plastic molding seams on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality, but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim and even top $70,000 for a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail is important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin, including gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big-screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids and autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is by the new B&O Play brand, a division of Bang & Olufsen, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nThe entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models on many levels and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness and amenities.\n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-size SUV in awhile, you’d better sit down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination charges, but you’ll never see that price on a dealer lot — they’re meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments.\n\nFar more likely to be found is an XLT trim, which starts at $52,985 with two-wheel drive. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,000 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop just short of 85 grand.\n\nMy regular-length Limited 4×4 model stickered at $72,655 including destination, and that included several popular equipment packages and leather for the first and second rows. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000 and can top out around $100,000.\n\nStill, the Expedition’s price is easily competitive with vehicles like the Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. It comes in at a bit more than the Nissan Armada, but it’s a significantly larger vehicle with a much bigger interior. It’s comparable in size to the Toyota Sequoia but has far surpassed that old, outdated model. It’s more refined, with a much nicer interior and a multimedia system that’s at least two or three generations more current.\n\nWith buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Some of this, like plastic mold flashing on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality (our test units were some very early examples), but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck at heart that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim or even top $70,000 in a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail becomes important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin. The new platform means that a fully updated electronic architecture is present, chock full of gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids, autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is the new B&O Play brand, and it sounds fantastic. The entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models, and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness, and amenities.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-sized SUV in a while, you’d better be sitting down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination and delivery, but you’ll never see one of those on a dealer lot — those are meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments. Far more likely is the XLT trim, which starts at $52,890 in 4×2 trim. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,100 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get, and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop short of 90 grand. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000, and can top out around $100,000.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStill, this is easily competitive with vehicles like the Chevy Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. With buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Updates to the 2015 Ford Expedition create one of the nicest-driving big SUVs ever, but the disappointing lack of cosmetic updates means few people are likely to notice.\n\nBig SUVs used to be the de facto choice of families all over the U.S. Able to haul massive amounts of stuff, or most of a basketball team, their body-on-frame V-8 power and four-wheel drive made them the ultimate wagons — all-weather, modern Conestogas that can haul boats and broods across the country.\n\nThat utility, however, came at a price — fuel economy, mostly, as the full-size SUV almost always came with a V-8 engine and thousands of pounds of steel to lug around. But times have changed, and the market has changed with them. Full-size SUVs are nowhere near as popular as they once were, having been relegated to the status of expensive specialty vehicle used primarily by people who specifically need their particular combination of hauling ability and cargo capacity.\n\nFord has just updated its Expedition, adding a slick electronic suspension and replacing the SUV’s ubiquitous V-8 engines with something new: a twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V-6. No V-8 engine is offered in the 2015 model (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here). GM is sticking with V-8s in its new Chevrolet Tahoe, so will this rather significant change affect the usability or desirability of Ford’s big SUV?\n\nExterior & Styling\nYour first thought upon approaching the 2015 Ford Expedition will undoubtedly be: “Did I buy a 2014 by mistake?” The changes for 2015 are so subtle as to be almost irrelevant — it looks almost exactly the same as it has since its last full redesign in 2007. There is a new grille and lower bumper, and new headlights and taillights are present (now with more LEDs), but that’s the extent of things to talk about for the exterior. As before, the Expedition is available in two lengths, the Expedition and Expedition EL, but both versions seat eight people as standardly configured.\n\nParts of the Expedition’s body and greenhouse glass look as if they haven’t changed since 1999. Contrast that with the significantly changed and very attractive all-new 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevy’s longer Suburban, and the refreshed Expedition looks like a brand-new 10-year-old truck.\n\nHow It Drives\nThankfully, the Ford Expedition most definitely does not drive like an older truck. In fact, it’s almost a pity Ford didn’t spend a little more coin on the cosmetic updates, as the changes to the chassis and powertrain have created a genuinely, dynamically impressive truck.\n\nPowering everything is a twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 that makes 365 horsepower, which is enough to get the Expedition moving with more urgency than you might expect from a V-6. Even with a V-8 no longer available, the Expedition doesn’t lose any of its towing or hauling ability — it just gains a little bit of fuel economy in exchange for those two cylinders. The tow rating for the Expedition goes up to 9,200 pounds when equipped with an optional towing package; it’s 6,500-6,600 pounds normally.\n\nMy test truck was equipped with Ford’s “continuous control suspension,” an electronic system that adjusts the shock absorbers to suit conditions or driver-selectable settings. It might seem odd to have a full-size SUV with a Sport mode for the suspension, but it actually works to keep the Expedition planted and better controlled. Feedback is still big-truck-vague, but it’s no longer numb and ponderous; the Expedition rides beautifully, handling pavement imperfections easily and quietly, giving just enough sensation through the steering wheel to boost confidence and control. Just be sure to keep the adjustable suspension in Normal or Sport modes; if you switch it to Comfort mode, be prepared for the motion of the ocean. In Comfort, the suspension goes squishy and the truck bobs over pavement undulations as if it has very poor body control. The brakes are firm and confidence-inspiring, bringing the big truck to a stop easily and with little drama.\n\nWith the switch from V-8 to turbo V-6 power, the EPA mileage estimates for the Expedition go up across the board, coming in at 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined for the two-wheel-drive model and 15/20/17 mpg for the four-wheel-drive Expedition. Opt for the larger, long-wheelbase truck, and your fuel economy suffers a little, coming in at 15/21/17 mpg for the two-wheel drive, 14/20/16 mpg for the four-wheel-drive EL.\n\nHere’s the kicker — the Ford is rated almost identically to the V-8-powered Chevrolet Tahoe, which in two-wheel-drive form gets 16/23/18 mpg. Two other V-8-powered full-size truck competitors, the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada, get considerably worse mileage: the two-wheel-drive Armada is rated 12/19/15 mpg and the two-wheel-drive Sequoia gets 13/17/15 mpg.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many others have reported from their experience with Ford’s EcoBoost turbocharged engines, I did not achieve the estimated ratings with my four-wheel-drive standard-length truck. My combined fuel economy — about half of which involved highway driving — netted just 15.6 mpg combined. While EPA estimates for the truck are higher, if there’s no actual benefit in measured everyday fuel economy, customers may be left wondering what the switch in powertrains achieves and what benefit the turbo six-cylinder really provides over GM’s advanced V-8. Thankfully, as mentioned before, the new engines sacrifice nothing in terms of drivability.\n\nInterior\nHopping up into the Expedition’s big, comfortable chairs is yet another step back in time. The interior looks about as unchanged as the exterior, with the exception of a new gauge cluster and center console screen and buttons. The plastic quality, trim cut lines, door panels, even the shape of the dash all look the same as the outgoing 2014 model — which sadly looked the same as the 2004 model.\n\nThankfully, it’s still comfortable in there, if not terribly modern. Seat comfort is fine in both front and back, with actual room in the third row for real human adults. Accessing the third row is also not terribly difficult, with second-row seats that tumble and fold and an optional power retractable step to help boost you up into the high-riding cabin.\n\nVisibility is excellent in all directions thanks to tall, upright windows and a high seating position that’s representative of the genre. While the overall interior is handily outclassed by the completely redone Chevy Tahoe, the Expedition is more comfortable thanks to a steering wheel that’s centered on the driver (unlike the Chevy) and a center console that’s not as wide or intrusive. If you’re looking for a slightly nicer interior (but only slightly nicer), the more expensive Lincoln Navigator offers better leather and a mildly more upscale interior, but its latest revision for 2015 suffers from the same issues as the Expedition — it’s not new or different enough from the outgoing model, and it’s handily outclassed by the Cadillac Escalade.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhat changes Ford did make to the Ford Expedition’s interior came mostly in the form of electronic upgrades. The new gauge cluster brings familiar and useful information displays to the driver. The center console features easy-to-use buttons, but the touch-screen still seems a bit small given the massive real estate available for a larger unit.\n\nThe latest generation of Sync’s voice controls all seem to work quite well, however, which is a welcome change from versions sampled in previous years. Connection is still a bit of a challenge, however, and it takes a while after hooking up a personal music device before it’s fully usable. The rest of the switches and controls feel much like the rest of the truck — old.\n\nThe Ford Expedition also did not get as extensive an electrical system redesign as the Tahoe did, meaning certain electronic systems — like adaptive cruise control and keyless remote entry with push-button start — are not available. Ford’s familiar door-mounted keypad is available, but it’s ancient tech and can be operated only while standing at the driver’s door. Again, a little extra money spent on the refresh would have gone a long way toward making the Expedition a lot more competitive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith the latest Tahoe redesign, Chevrolet has touted the truck’s new flat-folding third-row seats that disappear into the floor, but that’s a little misleading: Because of how the rear suspension is laid out on the Tahoe, true drop-down rear seats are not possible. A false platform makes it look like a flat floor, but the latest Tahoe loses several inches of vertical height in the process.\n\nThe Ford Expedition has no such problem. Due to the truck’s independent rear suspension, the seats can fold flat into the floor, creating a lower liftover height and a true flat floor, front to back. This becomes evident when you compare interior cargo room: Despite being relatively similar-sized trucks (the Tahoe is a bit shorter), the Expedition features 18.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row of seats, while the Tahoe comes up with just 15.3 cubic feet. The Sequoia, meanwhile, brings 18.9 cubic feet to the party, while the Armada tops them all with 20.0 cubic feet. With all the seats down, the Expedition bests the Tahoe again: 108.3 cubic feet to the Tahoe’s 94.7 cubic feet, while the Armada features 97.1 cubic feet. They all pale in comparison, though, to the cavernous Toyota, which sports 120.1 cubic feet.\n\nIf you need more room, Ford and Chevrolet have bigger versions of their trucks available. The Expedition EL wins the interior size comparison with its bigger cargo area, which also translates into a bigger third row. Behind the third row, the Expedition EL offers 42.6 cubic feet of room to the Chevrolet Suburban’s 38.9 cubic feet. Keep the third row stowed, and the Expedition EL offers 85.5 cubic feet of cargo room, versus the Suburban’s 76.7 cubic feet. Fold the second and third rows, and you get 130.8 cubic feet of room in the Expedition, versus 121.1 cubic feet in the Suburban. Third-row seating is more capacious in the Expedition EL as well, with 4.5 inches more shoulder room and 3.2 inches more legroom than the third row in the Suburban.\n\nUsing the cargo area is easy, too, with a third row that features optional power folding, operated by two switches in a side panel. Big trucks like this are used for hauling people and stuff, often at the same time, and the Expedition simply excels at both.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test results are not yet available for the new Expedition, but one rating has been published — a rollover rating of three stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As the Expedition received only a mild upgrade to its electrical systems, blind spot detection is now available, but more advanced systems like forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are not. Those features are available on competitors like the Tahoe.\n\nIf you’re looking for more airbags, you’ll have to head to Toyota — the Sequoia offers additional knee protection airbags, whereas the Tahoe, Expedition and Armada do not. See the Expedition’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nFord’s Expedition is not a cheap truck, starting at $45,040 including destination fee for a two-wheel drive, standard-wheelbase XLT base model, or $47,750 for an extended EL model. Adding four-wheel drive bumps that price up $2,925 with either wheelbase. The Limited model, which adds items like Sync with MyFord Touch, rain-sensing wipers, a power liftgate, the power-folding third-row seat, dual-zone automatic climate control and 20-inch alloy wheels, starts at $54,635 for the standard length Expedition or $57,287 for the EL. The King Ranch model is up next, but its changes are mostly cosmetic, with special leather, unique paint, halogen projector headlamps and painted exterior trim. It starts at $58,865 for the standard length, $61,515 for the EL.\n\nTopping the range is the new-for-2015 Platinum edition, which adds more luxurious leather seats and interior trim, standard power-retracting running boards and a 12-speaker Sony premium audio system for $59,825, or $62,475 for the EL. My test truck was a Limited, standard-length 4×4 with a few options, like the continuous control suspension and 22-inch wheels. It stickered for $61,815. Load an Expedition EL 4×4 Platinum up with every option, and you’ll nudge just more than $70,000.\n\nAs expensive as that seems, it’s actually quite competitive given the slightly more expensive price tag for Ford’s cross-town Chevy rival. The Tahoe LS 4×2 starts at $46,745 — that’s nearly $2,200 more than the base Ford Expedition XLT. The extended-wheelbase Tahoe is called the Suburban, and loading one up with all the options results in a truck that tops $77,000. It may cost a bit more, but the difference in interior quality and safety amenities versus the Ford makes up for that price difference, even if it is down a little on interior cargo capacity.\n\nThe old men on the block are the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada. The Sequoia starts at $45,320 for a 4×2 with the standard 5.7-liter V-8 and stretches up to more than $65,000 for a loaded 4×4 Platinum version. The Nissan Armada features much of the same kind of equipment as the Sequoia, but it’s considerably less expensive at every trim level. It starts at just $39,055 and tops out, loaded, at just more than $57,000. Both the Toyota and Nissan are more limited in their flexibility — each body type is available with only one length and one engine — and both feature interior appointments and electronics that are long overdue for an update.

      "expert_review": "Ford insists millennials are buying expensive full-size SUVs in ever-increasing numbers. The automaker says the percentage of millennial buyers of its own chunky, truck-based Expedition SUV has grown from 18% of overall sales five years ago to 28% today. With nearly a third of sales going to this new crop of owners, Ford looked into what they’re really seeking in such a big ride and found they’re looking to upgrade in size due to growing families — and that they also have a real need for something off-road-capable. And for those that don’t leave the pavement, something sportier and more expressive is on their wish list. That’s why the new model year has brought two new additions to the Expedition lineup: the Stealth Performance Package and the Timberline trim.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Ford Expedition\n\nUrban Flavor: The Expedition Stealth Performance Package\n\nIf you prefer the murdered-out streetfighter look, the Expedition has offered the Stealth Package since 2019, bringing exterior and interior design changes, a few new parts and new suspension tuning to make the SUV a little more ready to dance. It’s available on either the standard-length Expedition Limited trim or on the extended-length Expedition Max. On the outside, blacked-out trim abounds, with standard LED headlights and new taillights. It works best on an already-black model, but it didn’t look bad on the blue SUV I sampled. Wheels are upgraded to black 22-inch alloys, and the whole look is modern, understated and set to give a challenge to the Chevrolet Tahoe RST. There is no direct competitor in the Jeep Wagoneer lineup, however; in order to get the murdered-out Obsidian trim, you have to splurge for the Grand Wagoneer, a considerably more expensive proposition that competes more with the Lincoln Navigator or Cadillac Escalade. A sport-tuned suspension is included for a firmer, better-controlled ride; Ford’s Computer Controlled Damper system (CCD) is optional.\n\nNew for 2022 is the Stealth Performance Package, which adds some muscle to the streetfighter looks. The biggest difference between the Stealth and Stealth Performance Packages comes under the hood. The Stealth gets the basic twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine that’s standard in the Limited trim; the Stealth Performance model gets the high-output version seen on higher trim levels of the Expedition, as well as a different final drive ratio for snappier acceleration. The base power for the Stealth is a healthy 400 horsepower and 480 pounds-feet of torque, which climbs to 440 hp and 510 pounds-feet for the Stealth Performance model. Both are mated to a standard 10-speed automatic transmission, and both feature rear- or optional four-wheel drive.\n\nOut on the street, my time in a Stealth Performance model was quite enjoyable. Acceleration is snappy when called upon, but in normal circumstances, the Expedition with the high-output engine and sport suspension felt well composed and big-truck sedate. Any pretense at being actually sporty goes out the window when the first corner hits — the truck stays relatively flat in corners, but the steering ratio hasn’t changed from the base Expedition, and it’s fairly slow, meaning you’ll be making many cranks of the wheel when changing direction. This does not lend itself to spirited driving, but more calm cruising instead. The real standout was how well it rode, especially given the big 22-inch wheels on thinner low-profile tires. It’s an exceptionally smooth-riding truck, even when put into Sport mode, thanks to the adjustable nature of the CCD dampers. Compared to the performance trim of the Chevy Tahoe, the Expedition feels smoother and cushier over the moonscape of Michigan roads.\n\nInside, opting for the Stealth packages gets you a black leather interior with red stitching in the seats and doors, as well as uniquely patterned plastic dash and console trim that looks pretty slick. You also can opt for the enormous 15.5-inch vertical multimedia system running Ford’s latest Sync 4A, which does require a bit of a learning curve to operate but is also accompanied by a fair number of real buttons, so Ford has not yet gone to a full touch-sensitive glass cockpit idea like many competitors have. Overall, the Stealth Performance Package provides a good amount of style, content, performance enhancements and premium accommodations to satisfy the style-conscious millennial SUV buyer. But what about the ones that are more about the outdoor lifestyle?\n\nWoodland Romper: The Expedition Timberline\n\nA number of automakers have added woodsy, outdoor-themed trims to their lineups. GMC’s got AT4 trims, Hyundai’s trying out XRT, Subaru’s going for the Wilderness and so on. Ford’s doing it, too, with the Timberline trim, but on the Expedition, it’s much more than just window dressing — it actually adds functionality and true off-road ability to the SUV. What Ford has casually glossed over is that the new Timberline trim essentially replaces the FX4 Off-Road Package that used to be available on several Expedition trims. Now, if you want an off-road-capable Expedition with all-terrain tires, underbody skid plate protection, tow hooks and other rugged bits and goodies, you’ll only find them on the Timberline trim. This matches Chevrolet’s approach with the Tahoe: You can get all the off-road goods on only one trim level, called the Tahoe Z71, whereas before you could get that off-road package on several trim levels. For the Wagoneer, you can specify the Advanced All-Terrain Group on either the Wagoneer Series II or Series III trim levels, bringing different levels of equipment to each.\n\nBut the parts that the Expedition Timberline does feature do quite a bit to enhance its off-road chops. The basic underlying truck is the same as the Limited trim, but with a few extras such as the same high-output version of the V-6 that the Stealth Performance Package gets, standard 4WD, higher ground clearance thanks to taller Goodyear Wrangler off-road tires, Trail Turn Assist and other enhancements to its drive modes to better handle off-road duty.\n\nAnd handle it, it does. I took the Expedition Timberline through the Holly Oaks ORV Park in suburban Detroit, a challenging off-road park that makes a good test of the abilities of any off-road vehicle. The Expedition shows that underneath its shapely good looks lies the heart of an F-150-based truck and all the parts and abilities that truck brings to the party. The full- or part-time 4WD system delivers outstanding traction in conjunction with the electronic Terrain Management System. Slip the truck into the Mud/Ruts setting, lock the rear differential and off you go up and down muddy, rocky, or sandy trails with ease. The Trail Turn Assist feature comes in especially handy given the Expedition’s sheer size on the trails — when activated through an easy-to-use menu on the optional massive 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen my truck was equipped with, it individually brakes the inside wheel of the truck when it senses a tight turn, allowing the truck’s 4WD system to pivot around that temporarily “fixed point,” dramatically reducing the turning circle on an off-road trail.\n\nIt can’t hide the Expedition’s sheer bulk, however, which does work against it in tighter spots. But few obstacles placed in the Expedition Timberline’s path can’t be overcome. From rock crawling to higher-speed wash running, the capability of the Timberline is greater than most owners are likely to explore, but they should rest assured that their off-road-badged SUV is more than just a family SUV in a flannel jacket. It does feature a unique interior that’s truly good looking, however, in Deep Cypress with orange stitching and accents. The quality of the optional leather-trimmed cabin is excellent, and the dark plastic dash trim of the Stealth packages is replaced by bright aluminum-looking trim that helps lighten up the interior considerably. Ironically, it feels more upscale than the more expensive Stealth packages.\n\nMillennials Must Be Making Bank These Days\n\nI guess the old trope of millennials not being able to afford homes, have decent paying jobs or afford families has finally been put to bed, as neither the Timberline nor the Stealth Performance Package models of the Expedition come cheap. The price as-tested for my loaded Expedition with the Stealth Performance Package came to $85,140 (all prices include a rather egregious $1,795 destination charge). The truck starts as a Limited model, and you can add either the Stealth Package ($4,670) or the Stealth Performance Package ($9,880).\n\nThe Timberline is only a bit more affordable. It comes in two flavors, Timberland Standard and Timberline High, with a hefty price difference between them. Opt for the standard model to get all the off-road goodies, a vinyl-and-cloth interior that still looks quite fetching, a standard moonroof, 4WD and the high-output V-6 for just a tick under $73,000. Go for the High model like I drove, and it adds in a leather interior, the 15.5-inch touchscreen running Sync 4A, a 12.4-inch digital gauge cluster and a Bang & Olufsen sound system for an extra $9,220, bringing the as-tested price to $80,710.\n\nThese are premium prices for premium vehicles but are not at all out of line with competitors from General Motors or Jeep. So congratulations are in order to all the millennials out there whom Ford is targeting with these two specialty trims. Looks like y’all have made it to the big time, and as a reward, there are two truly enjoyable big SUVs waiting for you at your local Ford dealer.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Ford Expedition Platinum: What You Get When You Go Big\nOff-Road Package for 2020 Ford Expedition Limited Boasts Best of Both Worlds\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: More Quantity, More Quality\nWhat’s the Best Full-Size SUV for 2018?\nResearch the Ford Expedition\nHere’s What the New STX Edition on the 2021 Ford Expedition Costs\n2022 Ford Expedition: Now in Pine-Scented\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Might as well start off the new year with a vehicle that represents what went wrong with last year: a big sport-utility. This one is the 2006 Ford Expedition.\n\nIn case your memory has faltered only one day into the new year, big SUVs are the villains. They consume more than their share of petroleum, though when last we looked, not a single gallon of gas sold in this world carried anyone’s name on it.\n\nThey make it difficult to pull out of a parking space because you can’t see around them. Even some owners are upset because they ride and handle like trucks, which is understandable considering they are trucks.\n\nNo one warned consumers that SUVs were a tad unruly before those owners jumped the midsize sedan ship in the name of four-wheel-drive fashion.\n\nWhen gas prices spiked last year to more than $3 a gallon, consumers and environmentalists called for an end to these monsters until they could deliver at least 30 to 40 m.p.g. just like all the “normal” cars on the road–such as your “high mileage” Cadillac, Lincoln, Lexus, Infiniti and Jaguar.\n\nTo more fully appreciate the concerns over big SUVs, we tested one marking an anniversary. Ten years ago, Ford introduced Expedition because consumers demanded them.\n\nUnfortunately, the Expedition that arrived for testing was delivered in a snowstorm, which delayed our resentment toward it as long as it could get through the snow with all four wheels planted firmly on the ground.\n\nFunny how environmentalists in their high-mileage, front-wheel-drive small cars neglected to make any untoward gestures at the big SUV passing while they were slip-sliding away.\n\nAnd have to compliment Ford for its 4WD system. Turn the dial on the dash. There’s also a 4WD automatic setting that allows you to run in 2WD until wheel slippage is detected and then it switches to 4WD. No need to use 4WD low because it didn’t snow that much.\n\nExpedition is equipped with a 5.4-liter, 300-horsepower, V-8, the only engine choice. The big V-8 does a more than adequate job in getting you moving from the light and into the passing lane with some spirit. And thanks to its 365 foot-pounds of torque, it doesn’t have to take a deep breath to tow or haul heavy loads.\n\nBut, and here’s where the energy conscious have a point, it is rated at only 14 m.p.g. city and 17 m.p.g. highway. Have to admit that in foul weather, we never considered what the next gallon of fuel would cost.\n\nWhen the roads were dry, on the other hand, the eyes tended to look at the huge numbers outside the refueling stations.\n\nOne common big SUV complaint, the one about truck-like ride, didn’t prove true. Ford has adjusted the suspension so we enjoyed almost sedan-like ride without being bounced and brutalized in the cabin. Bumps and abrasions in the road weren’t jarring and jostling.\n\nHowever, this thing rides on a 119-inch wheelbase and is 205.8 inches long overall to hold three rows of seats as well as a massive amount of luggage. So you’ll lean in that seat when making a turn or taking a corner. You won’t need much prodding to back off the accelerator when having to direct the steering wheel to the left or right.\n\nYet Ford has taken pains to account for the vehicle’s size. AdvanceTrac stability control with roll-stability control is an option at $595. The system was borrowed from Volvo, which offered it first in the XC90 SUV. It uses gyroscopic sensors to detect possible tilt and employ the standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes and/or reduce engine power to keep the vehicle roof-rack side up. But when the motorist disregards speed or hits a curb at the wrong angle to trip the machine, a safety canopy air-bag curtain with rollover sensors deploys and stays deployedto protect occupants. It runs another $595.\n\nWhat Ford couldn’t do in a vehicle this size, however, is make it agile enough to slip into or out of parking stalls with ease. Whether at the mall or the grocery store, you have to look for a spot to park where you won’t be hemmed in and unable to open your doors.\n\nExpedition also comes in too many flavors: XLS, XLT, XLT Sport, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch, the version we tested. Hopefully, it will offer fewer when the new Expedition comes out for 2007. King Ranch adds such gingerbread as aluminum wheels with King Ranch logos; floor mats with those logos; step bars though some would call them running boards (regardless they are a necessity unless you top 6 feet tall); power folding and heated mirrors with built-in turn signals so those behind can better see your intention to turn; leather seats; and power third-row seats (standard King Ranch and Limited).\n\nPower control gives the third-row seats character. Push the buttons along the side wall in the cargo hold to lower either or both the left or right side of the bench seat. Push the buttons again to raise them. The large cargo hold becomes massive with the third-row seats folded flat.\n\nPlan your loading carefully and you can press the buttons to angle up the seat backs and slide the packages toward you so you don’t have to stretch so far inside.\n\nBut there still is stretching to do. The hatch lid has a handle on the outside for easy opening. But the lid rises high for loading and unloading and to close it you have to reach far inside to grab a pull cord.\n\nGetting into the third-row seat was made easy by the optional pair of second-row captain’s chairs ($795) rather than a three-passenger bench seat. The captain’s chairs provided a wide aisle to the third, which was a surprise, with ample head, leg and arm room for adults. It actually has more leg room than in the slightly cramped second row.\n\nA most pleasant option for the second- and third-rows is a DVD system with a pull-down screen and headphones. Anyone who traveled to grandma’s without such a system over the Christmas holidays will never know the ability of DVD technology to keep the rug rats at peace unless they buy one–at a hefty $1,500.\n\nOther noteworthy features include power plugs in the dash and rear cargo wall, a huge center console storage compartment under the armrest that has not only coin, tissue box and pen holder, but also room for a laptop and a host of DVDs.\n\nLarge and small stowage compartments dot the cabin, though the glove box is so tiny a pair of gloves will barely fit.\n\nOther nice touches are a reverse-sensing system ($255) that bleeps a warning when objects are behind; a power moonroof ($860); power adjustable pedals (standard in King Ranch); and power rear quarter windows ($125) that bring fresh air to third-row passengers. Unlike some minivans, however, both windows open or close together, not separately.\n\nThe ’06 Expedition King Ranch 4×4 starts at $45,240, and includes air conditioning; power windows, door locks and driver’s seat; and AM/FM stereo radio with CD and cassette player.\n\nThe price tag is one reason some who want the security of four- or all-wheel-drive are switching to smaller SUVs or crossovers. Low mileage and so-so handling are others.\n\nExpedition sales are down about 24 percent from a year ago.\n\n– – –\n\n2006 Ford Expedition King Ranch 4×4\n\n$49,965*\n\nPrice as tested\n\nCITY 14 m.p.g.\n\nHWY 17 m.p.g.\n\nWheelbase: 119 inches\n\nLength: 205.8 inches\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter, 300-h.p., V-8\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$45,240 Base\n\n$255 Reverse-sensing system\n\n$795 Second-row captain’s chairs\n\n$860 Power moonroof\n\n$595 Advance traction control with roll-stability control\n\n$595 safety canopy with rollover sensors\n\n$125 power rear quarter windows\n\n$1,500 rear-seat DVD entertainment system\n\n*Add $820 for freight\n\nPLUSES\n\n– No shortage of room for people or their possessions and you sit up high seating so you can see what’s coming down the road.\n\n– Four-wheel-drive for any season or any reason motoring.\n\n– Available goodies such as power folding third-row seat, power adjustable pedals, roll stability control and safety canopy.\n\n– It offers good ride considering the size.\n\nMINUSES\n\n– Mileage\n\n– Effects of size on handling as well as on slipping into and out of a parking space.\n\n———-\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation and Wednesday and Friday in Business.

      "expert_review": "For those who despise massive sport utility vehicles, the Ford Expedition is an obvious target of wrath.\n\nBlamed for everything from wasting natural resources to blocking the sun, the 5,400-pound Expedition and its ilk are linked to supporting terrorists in oil-producing countries and, in one evangelical twist, tarred as vehicles that Jesus would refuse to drive.\n\nBut try as I might, I found it difficult to hate the Expedition, despite its gas-guzzling ways. All new for 2003, the Expedition sports a sleek new exterior, a new interior with some interesting power features and a new chassis complete with independent rear suspension.\n\nThe independent suspension seems like a weird addition to a full-size truck, which up until now always came with a beefy solid rear axle. But independent rear suspension creates at least two major improvements over the former Expedition:\n\n-A third row of seats with enough room for actual humans and that fold nicely into the floor.\n\n-A smooth, refined ride more like a car than a truck.\n\nThe only downside was a tendency for the Expedition to wallow at the rear in sharp turning maneuvers.\n\nDespite its bulk, the Expedition is easy to drive like a car. At least until you try to squeeze through traffic or tuck into a tight parking spot. The new rack-and-pinion steering is responsive, and the massive brakes are very effective.\n\nBehind the wheel, it’s easy to fathom the raging popularity of these heavyweights. Owners of full-size SUVS are quick to point out the high driving position with its commanding view of the road, the overall feeling of security from accidents or road hazards, plus the exceptional roominess for people and belongings.\n\nIn the two-wheel-drive XLT model tested here, eight people can be transported in reasonable comfort. Or with the third seat folded into the floor and the second row folded forward, there’s a spacious cargo bed that’s big enough for a 4- by 8-foot sheet of plywood.\n\nThe XLT is the lower rung of two Expedition models, under the Eddie Bauer edition. The XLT model comes well-equipped with power and convenience features, running boards, fog lamps, premium audio and that folding rear seat.\n\nStandard on Eddie Bauer and optional on the XLT is a power folding rear seat that folds into the floor with the touch of a button.\n\nThe standard engine on the XLT is a 232-horsepower 4.6-liter, with a 5.4-liter, 260-horsepower engine optional on the XLT and standard on the Eddie Bauer. The test truck came with the 5.4, and it proved to be smooth and strong, with loads of low-end torque and a towing capacity of 8,900 pounds.\n\nFuel economy is a contradiction in terms, with the Expedition averaging around 13 miles per gallon during my week of driving, according to the onboard computer.\n\nThe brakes come standard with antilock and include Brake Assist, an electronic system that senses the onset of a panic stop and applies full braking force.\n\nThe sophisticated exterior styling of the new Explorer is nicely squared-off yet with a muscular appearance. Ford kept the signature grille intact, making the 2003 Expedition easily recognizable.\n\nThe interior is pleasantly comfortable but fairly bland. The dashboard could use some of the high-style design seen in the Navigator.\n\nThe test Expedition came well equipped at $35,800 and included just a few optional extras. A side-airbag canopy with rollover sensor was $580; a reverse radar-sensing system was $255, and shipping was $740. On the test truck, the 5.4 engine was a no-cost option, and the total came to $37,375.\n\nNicely updated, the Expedition should continue as a top seller for Ford, barring a large-scale anti-SUV backlash.\n\nFord Expedition XLT\n\nVehicle type: Eight passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $35,800.\n\nPrice as tested: $37,375.\n\nEngine: 5.4-liter V-8, 260 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, 350 pounds-feet torque at 2,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 119 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,416 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 8,900 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 14 city, 19 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nImproved ride, handling.\n\nIndependent rear suspension.\n\nAttractive styling.\n\nLows:\n\nWallowing in turns.\n\nBland interior.\n\nBig SUV woes.",
