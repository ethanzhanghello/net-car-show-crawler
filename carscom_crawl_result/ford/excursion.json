      "expert_review": "With Dodge getting ready to muscle in on the super-sized sport-utility vehicle market in 2002, you could forgive the marketing folks at General Motors Corp. for wistfully reminiscing about the days when they had a virtual monopoly on the full-size SUV segment.\n\nFord horned in on that exclusivity several years ago when it introduced the Expedition as a derivative of its F-150 pickup. Last year, the Dearborn-based company upped the ante with the launch of the Excursion, the industry’s largest and heftiest sport-ute to date.\n\nFortunately, GM had scheduled a full makeover last fall of its big SUV twins, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL. The good news is that, while Suburban has surrendered the sheer-mass and size crown to the Excursion, it is a considerably better vehicle than its predecessor. And, in many ways, it’s notably better than the competition.\n\nIn early June, we tested two nearly identically equipped examples of these head-to-head rivals – a 2000 Ford Excursion Limited 4×4 and a 2000 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4×4.\n\nFord Excursion Limited 4×4\n\nOur Excursion had a neutral-color cabin trimmed in leather and wood which, upon closer examination, revealed oodles of plastic that looked cheap and tacky in a vehicle that costs this much. Several pieces of trim didn’t fit together well, leaving unsightly gaps.\n\nWe found the seating comfort to be better in the front buckets than in the middle and rear benches. Legroom is only marginal in the third row. The rest of the vehicle is amazingly roomy. That holds true for cargo space as well, with the Excursion enjoying a decided edge over the Suburban, with seats up or folded flat.\n\nFord has bundled a good assortment of safety features into the Excursion, including antilock brakes and side air-bags. Convenience features abound, from air conditioning and a premium sound system to a huge overhead console. There is a comprehensive instrument panel, with excellent rear-seat controls for audio and climate systems.\n\nTwo dimensions may prove troublesome to shorter people. The step-in height from the ground to the running board is about 14-12 inches, with another 10-inch hike into the cabin – considerably higher than the Suburban. And the rear liftover height into the cargo bay is a difficult 35 inches making loading groceries difficult.\n\nOur test vehicle was fitted with one of the biggest truck engines on the planet, a massive 6.8-liter V-10 that pumps out 310 horsepower and a whopping 425 lbs. ft. of torque. Even in a vehicle that weighs more than three tons unladen, you’ll feel that muscle when you put your foot to the throttle. Ford doesn’t have to report fuel-economy figures under the government rules for this vehicle class, but you’ll be lucky to realize much more than 10-12 m.p.g. on average.\n\nAgain, due in part to the vehicle’s sheer size, we found the steering to be a bit vague and cumbersome, making parking and maneuverability even mor e of a chore than we anticipated. The ride feels bouncy and truck-like.\n\nTo sum things up: If towing and cargo capacity are your chief concerns, by all means, buy the Excursion; in that regard, it’s best in class. But with its macho, in-your-face styling, the Excursion will turn off many female buyers. It simply looks and feels too much like an uncivilized brute next to the Suburban.\n\nChevrolet Suburban LT 4×4\n\nOur test vehicle was leather-trimmed and amply equipped, but the biggest differences from the Excursion were the adaptation of twin captain’s chairs in the middle row and the use of a much smaller engine, a 5.3-liter V-8.\n\nSeating comfort was excellent, with adjustable lumbar support and heat for front occupants. Access to the third row is to squeeze between the two middle buckets – not necessarily a better solution than the Excursion, on which the middle bench slides forward to facilitate entry and exit to the rear. Although it’s not as big ins as the Excursion, the Suburban feels quite roomy at every seating position except the rear most. Visibility is good, and the vehicle is a tad quieter than the Excursion at freeway speeds.\n\nThe cargo area, while a bit smaller than on the Excursion, is still exceptional. Chevrolet has freed up space by mounting the full-size spare under the vehicle; Ford mounts the spare inside the cargo bay. Where the Excursion has a glass liftgate and double-Dutch doors in the rear, the Suburban uses a more conventional tailgate.\n\nSafety features are every bit as good as the competition, with the added bonus of shoulder harnesses that are built into the seats. In terms of convenience items, we can’t think of too many features that are lacking on the Suburban, which even comes with GM’s OnStar communications system.\n\nWorkmanship is better in nearly every respect, from paint quality to trim fits. GM uses a higher-quality plastic throughout, and the attention to detail is impressive. As far as exterior styling, we’d characterize it as subtle and conservative, but tasteful. Simply put, it works.\n\nWith the 5.3-liter engine, acceleration is adequate, but not overwhelming. Likewise, fuel economy is about what you’d expect at around 12-14 mpg.\n\nThe power steering is fairly responsive, considering the Suburban’s size and mass, and the antilock brakes work well. The premium ride suspension on our test vehicle seemed to soak up bumps and potholes with surprising ease.\n\nThis is still a mighty big horse, and it’s not fun to park but otherwise, the Suburban is amazingly easy to operate.\n\nIn short, the Chevrolet Suburban is a good, solid package, with subtle, tasteful styling. It is expensive but equipped like a luxury car. And it remains best in class.\n\nComparing the heavyweights\n\n2000 Ford Excursion Ltd. 4×4\n\nWheelbase: 137.0 in.\n\nLength: 226.7 in.\n\nWidth: 80.0 in.\n\nCurb Weight: 6650 lbs.\n\nBase Engine: 5.4L V-8\n\nPower: 255 hp.\n\nCargo Capacity: 48.0 cu.ft.\n\nPrice (as tested): $41,800\n\nRating: Above Average ***\n\n2000 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4×4\n\nWheelbase: 130.0 in.\n\nLength: 219.3 in.\n\nWidth: 78.8 in.\n\nCurb Weight: 4194 lbs.\n\nBase Engine: 5.3L V-8\n\nPower: 285 hp.\n\nCargo Capacity: 45.7 cu.ft.\n\nPrice (as tested): $42,480\n\nRating: World Class ****",

      "expert_review": "Ford’s Excursion is one of the biggest SUVs on the road. While its size may draw the ire of those who fret that SUVs have gotten too big, this is a vehicle meant for work. It can carry up to nine people or tow up to 11,000 pounds. If you need to tow a horse trailer, large boat or haul half of the Little League team, there is nothing like it.\n\nThe Excursion, first introduced in 1999, is not just big, it can be loaded with enough luxury equipment to rival nearly any car. That increases its appeal to upscale buyers that have use for its capabilities. For 2002, the Limited Ultimate tops the model lineup with a formidable list of luxury appointments: dual second-row captain’s chairs with leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, steering-wheel controls for temperature and audio and a rear-seat entertainment system that has a video screen mounted in the ceiling. The unit in our test vehicle used VHS tapes, but a DVD system will be available later in the year. While most of the attention for 2002 is focused on the Limited Ultimate, all models get clear-lens headlights and new colors.\n\nA two-wheel-drive XLT starts at just over $35,000, and a four-wheel-drive, turbo-diesel Limited Ultimate starts at nearly $47,000. That’s the model I drove.\n\nDriving a rig this big has a certain appeal. It is nice to have a vehicle capable of hauling heavy trailers, swallowing all sorts of lawn or home-improvement junk or even a couple of bicycles. Sitting up high gives a commanding view of the road, and its sheer bulk imparts a sense of security. From a practical perspective, the Excursion mixes the people-hauling capability of a minivan with the load-carrying ability of a pickup. It is more than 7 inches longer and nearly 6 inches taller than the Chevrolet Suburban, although on the road it didn’t really drive much differently than a Navigator or Expedition. The 137-inch wheelbase inhibits the turning radius, and that in turn required extra care in parking lots and bank drive-ups.\n\nGetting in requires use of the side step, at least for me, and once you’re settled inside, its spaciousness is obvious. Because it is based on Ford’s Super Duty pickup truck, the cabin is wide and the instrument panel looks more utilitarian than that of the smaller F-150. A large center console separates the front seats. The Limited has five power outlets, including some on the rear of the floor console, so occupants can use laptops, portable CD players and telephones. Woodgrain trim softens the trucklike interior and makes it more inviting. Flipping on the seat heaters takes the chill out of autumn mornings.\n\nSecond-row captain’s chairs reduce seating capacity to seven, but that is hardly a drawback. The captain’s chairs are more comfortable than a bench seat and allow easy passage to the third seat. Easy access to the third-row seat would be handy for parents who put child seats back there. Access to the second seat has been simplified by back doors that are 5.5 inches wider than those of the Suburban. There is 48 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third seat alone. Remove the third seat, fold the second seat flat and a full sheet of plywood slides right in. Around back, the glass hatch tilts up and two side-opening doors take the place of a tailgate. The dual doors allow access to the cargo space while a trailer is attached.\n\nFour-wheel-drive Excursions have two powertrain choices: a 6.8-liter Triton V-10 and the 7.3-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel. The Power Stroke engine is the choice for those who need to do serious hauling because its 500 foot-pounds of torque is available at low rpm. Although the diesel is noisier than the gasoline engine in city driving, it runs very quietly on the highway. Aside from higher towing capacity, it also gets better fuel mileage. Our test truck’s computer showed an average of 13.7 miles per gallon in city driving, and that is better than the V-10. On the highway, the diesel should be capable of 17 or 18 mpg, hich is not bad considering the size and weight of the vehicle.\n\nThe electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system, activated by a dash-mounted selector switch, allows total disengagement of the front wheels by a vacuum system.\n\nIn spite of its engine size, the Excursion qualifies as a Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) that produces 43 percent fewer smog-forming emissions than the maximum allowed by law. Recycled steel, aluminum, plastic and rubber make up about 20 percent of the vehicle, and at the end of its life more than 85 percent is recyclable, according to Ford.\n\nThe automatic transmission’s automatic tow-haul feature uses a computer module to help adjust transmission shift patterns for hills, changes in altitude or towing heavy loads. A switch on the gear lever locks out the overdrive fourth gear to obtain third-gear braking in downgrades. The transmission also has a standard auxiliary cooler for heavy-duty use.\n\nTo counteract concerns that the Excursion poses a danger to smaller cars in a collision, Ford designed a beam under the front bumper, at the same height as a regular car’s bumper, to absorb energy and keep the truck from riding up over a smaller vehicle in the event of a collision. The standard Class IV trailer hitch serves much the same purpose in back.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our Limited Ultimate was $46,905. Power telescoping towing mirrors, second-row captain’s chairs, in-dash six-disc CD player and the rear-seat entertainment system brought the sticker price to $50,325.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: For people who need heavy-duty hauling or towing, the Excursion stands ready and willing. It can hold up to nine people, depending on the seat configuration, or tow as much as 11,000 pounds. The Power Stroke diesel is the engine of choice for those who tow. The Limited Ultimate model has luxury-car accommodations, and a rear-seat entertainment system is optional for 2002.\n\nCounterpoint: The size that makes the Excursion ideal for hauling is also a drawback when it comes to city living. In addition to having a sizable thirst, it is tall, wide and bulky, especially in shopping-center parking lots and bank drive-through lanes.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 7.3-liter, 250-hp V-8 turbodiesel\nTransmission: automatic Four-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 137.1 inches\nCurb weight: not available\nBase price: $46,905\nAs driven: $50,325\nMpg rating: 13.7 avg.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShoppers looking for the largest sport utility vehicle in any showroom still must turn to Ford. The Excursion measures nearly 19 feet long  thats 21 inches longer than the companys full-size Expedition and more than 7 inches longer than its next closest rivals, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.\n\nBut bigger isnt necessarily better. Ford has announced that the massive Excursion will likely be dropped during the 2004 model year.\n\nThe Excursion comes in XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited trim levels and may be equipped with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. For 2004, an XLS version replaces the XLT Value Edition. A new Eddie Bauer series joined the Excursion lineup for 2003, and a new 6.0-liter Power Stroke diesel engine that generates 325 horsepower and 560 pounds-feet of torque also became available. The diesel engine teams with a five-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Other power plants offered include 5.4-liter V-8 and 6.8-liter V-10 gasoline engines.\n\nExterior\nTraditional and oversized SUV styling cues include four side doors. Ford claims that the Excursions back doors are wider than those on the Suburban; this allows easier access to the middle and rear seats. The rear door features a tri-panel arrangement, which has a window on top that flips up and twin Dutch doors below that open to the sides. A BlockerBeam runs across the vehicle below the front bumper to prevent cars from sliding underneath it in the event of a collision.\n\nSteel or aluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires. The Excursion rides a 137.1-inch wheelbase, stretches 226.7 inches long overall and has an 8.1-inch ground clearance. Chrome running boards are optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Excursion has a nine-passenger capacity, plus 48 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the rear seat. The seats of the second-row split bench tip and fold forward to allow easier access to the third row. The rear bench seat is removable and rolls on built-in wheels. Cargo volume grows to 146 cubic feet with the rear seat removed and the middle bench folded; that space can carry a 4-by-8-foot plywood sheet. Wireless headphones are included with an optional DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are available. A 255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 is standard on rear-drive models, and a 310-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 is standard in four-wheel-drive models and optional in 4x2s. Both of these engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The 325-hp Power Stroke 6.0-liter diesel V-8 mates with a five-speed-automatic transmission. Towing capacity is as high as 11,000 pounds with the V-10 and diesel engines.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available. An optional reverse-sensing system may be installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDrive an Excursion and youre in a truck, period. Expect the typical engine and transmission drone found in trucks, coupled with ride quality that bears little resemblance to a passenger car. The Power Stroke diesel engine performs admirably, but it enhances the sensation of being in a full-fledged truck. The diesel-powered version manages to climb some steep grades but at a leisurely pace.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShoppers looking for the largest sport utility vehicle in any showroom can still turn to Ford. The Excursion measures nearly 19 feet long � that’s 21 inches longer than the company’s full-size Expedition and more than 7 inches longer than its next closest rivals, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.\n\nBigger isn’t necessarily better, and sales of mammoth SUVs have tapered off. Ford had suggested that the massive Excursion might be dropped during 2004. But it earned a reprieve and continues into 2005 with new jeweled headlights, a fresh grille and bumper, and revised wheel choices.\n\nExcursions come in XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited trim levels and can be equipped with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The abundantly equipped Eddie Bauer model joined the Excursion lineup for 2003, when a new 6.0-liter Power Stroke diesel engine that generates 325 horsepower and 560 pounds-feet of torque also became available. The diesel engine teams with a five-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. A 5.4-liter V-8 or a 6.8-liter V-10 gasoline engine can also power the Excursion.\n\nExterior\nTraditional and oversized SUV styling cues include four side doors. Ford claims the Excursion’s back doors are wider than those on the Suburban; this allows easier access to the middle and rear seats. The rear door features a tri-panel arrangement, which has a window on top that flips up and twin doors below that open to the sides.\n\nAluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires. The Excursion rides a 137-inch wheelbase, stretches 226.4 inches long overall and has an 8.5-inch ground clearance. Lighted running boards are available.\n\nInterior\nThe Excursion has a nine-passenger capacity, plus 48 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the rear seat. Split bench seats in the second row tip and fold forward to allow easier access to the third row. The rear bench is removable and rolls on built-in wheels. Cargo volume grows to 146 cubic feet with the rear seat removed and the middle bench folded; that space can carry a 4-by-8-foot plywood sheet. Wireless headphones are included with an optional DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are available. A 255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 is standard on rear-drive models. A 310-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 that delivers 425 pounds-feet of torque is standard in four-wheel-drive models and optional in 4x2s. Both of these engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The 325-hp Power Stroke 6.0-liter diesel V-8 mates with a five-speed-automatic transmission. Towing capacity is as high as 11,000 pounds with the V-10 and diesel engines.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available. A reverse-sensing system can be installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDrive an Excursion, and you’re in a truck, period. Expect the typical engine and transmission drone found in trucks, coupled with ride quality that bears little resemblance to a passenger car. The Power Stroke diesel engine performs admirably, but it enhances the sensation of being in a full-fledged truck. The diesel-powered version manages to climb some steep grades but at a leisurely pace.",

      "expert_review": "Posted on 12/9/02\nVehicle Overview\nShoppers looking for the largest sport utility vehicle in any showroom must turn to Ford. The Excursion measures nearly 19 feet long  thats nearly 21 inches longer than the companys full-size Expedition, and it is more than 7 inches longer than its next closest rivals, the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.\n\nBuilt on the same platform as Fords F-250 Super Duty pickup truck, the Excursion exceeds an 8,500-pound gross vehicle weight rating (the vehicles weight plus what it can carry in passengers and cargo), which makes it exempt from federal emissions and fuel-economy requirements. Ford has been promoting environmental concerns in connection with its SUV lineup, which includes an announcement that the Excursion qualifies as a Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV).\n\nEnvironmentalists have never stopped jeering at the jumbo Excursion, citing its close-to-insatiable fuel consumption. The standard 44-gallon fuel tank is indicative of the vehicles unappetizing gas mileage, though Ford emphasizes the fact that it gives the vehicle a long range between fill-ups.\n\nThe Excursion comes with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD). A new Eddie Bauer series joins the XLT and Limited models for 2003, and they will feature an Arizona Beige grille insert and fascias. Early in 2003, a new 6.0-liter Power Stroke diesel engine will debut, and it will deliver 325 horsepower and 550 pounds-feet of torque. A new TorqShift five-speed-automatic transmission will accompany that diesel engine. New 16-inch forged wheels and an in-dash six-CD changer go on the Limited edition, and all A-pillars on the drivers side gain grab handles.\n\nDespite rising fuel prices in 2000 and into 2001, Fords behemoth SUV managed to sell well enough. But total sales for 2001 dipped by 31.7 percent to just 34,710 units, as reported by Automotive News. In July 2002, Ford sources acknowledged that production of the Excursion will end after the 2004 model year.\n\nExterior\nEven though the Excursion is abundantly sized, traditional SUV styling includes four side doors. Ford claims that the Excursions back doors are wider than those on the Suburban for easier access to the middle and rear seats. The rear door is a tri-panel arrangement, which features a window on top that flips up and twin Dutch doors below that open to the sides. A BlockerBeam runs across the vehicle below the front bumper to prevent cars from sliding underneath it in the event of a collision.\n\nAluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires. The Excursion rides a 137.1-inch wheelbase, stretches 226.7 inches long overall and has an 8.1-inch ground clearance. Two-wheel-drive (2WD) models are 77.2 inches high, vs. 80.2 inches high for the 4×4 editions. A standard trailer hitch provides similar protection at the rear.\n\nInterior\nThe Excursion has a nine-passenger capacity, plus 48 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the rear seat. The seats of the second-row split bench tip and fold forward to allow easier access to the third row. The rear bench seat is removable and rolls on built-in wheels. The cargo volume grows to 146 cubic feet with the rear seat removed and the middle bench folded down; that space can carry a 4-by-8-foot plywood sheet. Optional power-adjustable accelerator and brake pedals adjust within a 3-inch range to suit individual drivers.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree engines are available in the Excursion. A 255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 is standard on 2WD models. A 310-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 goes into 4WD models and is optional on 4x2s, and an optional 7.3-liter V-8 turbo-diesel produces 250 hp. These engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A new 325-hp Power Stroke 6.0-liter diesel will arrive during the 2003 model year; it will team with a new five-speed-automatic transmission. The Excursions towing capacity is as high as 11,000 pounds with the V-10 or diesel engine.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDescribing the drive in an Excursion is easy: Youre in a truck, period. Expect the typical engine and transmission drone found in trucks, coupled with ride quality that bears little resemblance to a passenger car. Fords newly redesigned Expedition yields a far more pleasing experience overall  including more satisfactory acceleration  and the slightly smaller model has enough interior space to suit most buyers.\n\nThe Excursions new Power Stroke diesel engine performs admirably, but it enhances the sensation of being in a full-fledged truck. A Power Stroke diesel Excursion managed to climb some steep grades but at a leisurely pace.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",
