      "expert_review": "A restless Nite can be a pleasant one.\n\nFord has seen to that with its Nite performance/appearance version of the full-size Bronco utility vehicle for 1992.\n\nNite refers to darkness, because you only can get this special Bronco in all black-including bumpers, grille and window trim. Nite doesn`t necessarily refer to Knight, especially when the bold-looking Bronco being tested sportsa pink tape stripe from stem to stern. Blue is an optional tape choice and-you may find this difficult to believe-but a dealer we asked about the two colors said pink is preferred by women, blue by men. How stereotypical!\n\nThe Nite we drove came with the pink decal, a color that somewhat emasculates this macho machine. It`s difficult to picture the four-wheel off- the-road crowd bouncing through creeks and tumbling over dunes in a buggy corseted in pink.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Nite we test drove had ample muscle to travel those creeks or dunes or cruise the open highway. It came with the optional 5.8- liter, 200-horsepower V-8 teamed with automatic. A 5-liter, 185-h.p. V-8 with 3-speed automatic is standard.\n\nWhat makes the Nite so restless is the quickness delivered by the 5.8- liter V-8. What makes the Nite so unusual is that it can be so quick, yet quiet. You`d think you were behind the wheel of a Continental sedan, not a Bronco four-wheeler. What makes Nite questionable as a daily commuter vehicle is that the 5.8 and automatic are rated at 12 miles per gallon city/16 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe 32-gallon fuel tank extends driving range, but when you need to fill a tank that size, you better be carrying a credit card.\n\nNite also comes with a handling suspension package that includes heavy- duty springs and shocks. Heavy-duty didn`t mean harsh. The suspension and the p235 15-inch all-season radial tires combined to provide more car-like than truck-like ride, which is so un-Ford like. We`ve come to expect Ford trucks, utilities and vans to be a bit stiffer and harsher than the cars in the line. The Nite had exceptional road manners and was most polite to the bodies cradled in the captain`s chairs inside.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Bronco sit stall to provide the height needed for off roading, though you can count the number taken off the blacktop or concrete on both hands. Usually this means you feel top heavy from the raised center of gravity. The feeling is most pronounced in corners and turns. It`s usually best to back off the accelerator in a sharp turn to reduce body swing or lean-both yours and the vehicle`s.\n\nThe Nite we drove didn`t feel antsy when the road became crooked. The body-the vehicle`s and ours-sat relatively flat when maneuvering. Wide and supportive cloth-covered captain`s chairs also helped.\n\nAnother plus was the optional $123 push-button four-wheel-drive feature. Press the button on the dash marked 4×4 and you switch from 2WD to 4WD without fooling wi th a transfer case. If you need to get into 4WD low for a tough pull, simply press another button.\n\nThe $123 is a good investment for those who don`t want reach down and fiddle with the lever on a transfer case, and those who appreciate the added leg room up front when the transfer case is removed.\n\nSmokers and those who like ample circulation of air will appreciate the side vent windows on Bronco. They open so you can flick the ash or cool off the interior without having to open the big windows.\n\nThe Bronco has undergone a styling change for 1992, most notably up front. The look is cleaner and less bulky than on previous Broncos. Still, we wish Ford designers would have taken that extra step as long as they were changing the vehicle and added a step to help those of us with short inseams to get into the cab without having to make a running leap.\n\nChrysler has been experimenting with an automatic running board on some of its vans and trucks that w uld power out for usage when the door was open and power back under the body when the door was closed. This would be a nice feature for Ford to add to its Bronco.\n\nAdding to the problem of getting in is the fact the carpeted mats on the Nite didn`t stay firmly secured to the carpeted floor underneath. The large vinyl foot plate under the pedals gave the plastic nipples on the mats nowhere to stick. So, we`d hop up on the mat, the mat would slide away, and on more than one occasion we nearly became volunteer spokesman for the national groin- pull foundation.\n\nSlipping mats do present a serious problem because they tend to bunch up under the front pedals. A design change would be in order.\n\nAnother minor gripe is the huge stowage compartment between driver and front-seat passenger. It`s large enough to hold ample vacation goodies, from pop cans to sandwiches or small toys for the kids. But the top of the compartment features a coin/cassette holder that gets in the way when you`re trying to store items. The coin/cassette holder could be built into the wall of the compartment for easy use while still allowing for ample storage.\n\nOur test vehicle came with power outside mirrors, but crank handle powerless windows.In a vehicle this size, you need power mirror and window controls so you don`t have to wait until you`re stopped to make adjustments.\n\nIn the good news/bad news department, Bronco comes with anti-lock brakes, which is good, but only on the rear wheels, which is two fewer than the rival Chevy Blazer.\n\nAs for a Bronco/Blazer (Cartalk, Sunday, Feb. 23) comparison, the edge goes to Bronco in ride and handling, though it`s built on a shorter wheelbase, and the larger Blazer gets the nod for room and comfort. Looks are a draw. Bronco scores for its optional 4WD push-button control, Blazer for four-wheel ABS as standard. Both have troublesome step in height.\n\nSizewise, the Bronco is built on a 104.7-inch wheelbase versus 111.5 inches on the Blazer. Overall length is 183.6 inches Bronco, 187.7 Blazer. The 5.8-liter, 200-h.p. V-8 in Bronco is 10 horses shy of the 5.7-liter, 210 h.p. V-8 in Blazer. Yet Bronco gets 1 m.p.g. less city and highway driving mileage than Blazer at 12/16 to 13/17. Blazer`s tank holds only 30 gallons versus Bronco`s 32.\n\nBase price of the four-wheel-drive Bronco is $22,348. The Nite package added $1,326. In addition to black bumpers, grille and window trim, the package included cruise control, tilt wheel, rear-window defroster, AM/FM stereo with cassette and clock, tinted privacy glass, tachometer, outside spare-tire carrier and forged aluminum wheels.\n\nOur test vehicle added the 5.8 V-8 at $221, 4-speed automatic at $924 and push-button 4WD at $123. The sticker ran $24,942 plus a $585 freight charge.\n\nName change\n\nNissan is replacing the Stanza for the 1993 model year with a redesigned model that looks li ke a cross between a Maxima and an Infiniti (and a wee bit like a Lexus), and in doing so will give the machine a new name-Altima.\n\nNissan says Altima suggests a “higher order“ while sharing a resemblance to the Maxima name.\n\nAltima will be built at Nissan`s Smyrna, Tenn., plant, which produces the Sentra car and compact pickup trucks. Once that plant`s expansion is completed, it will be able to produce 450,000 vehicles annually.\n\n>> 1992 Bronco Nite\nWheelbase: 104.7 inches Length: 183.6 inches Engine: 5.8-liter, 200-h.p. V-8. Transmission: 4-speed automatic. Fuel economy: 12 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g highway. Base price: $22,348. Strong point: Smooth ride and sure-footed handling without being top heavy despite its size. Availability of push-button-activated 4WD. Very good power from 5.8-liter V-8. The 32-gallon fuel tank ex ends driving range between fills. Weak point: Four-wheel ABS preferred over rear-wheel ABS only. For th e 5.8 V-8`s power you pay the price at the fuel pump; you need deep pockets when filling a 32-gallon tank. Could use step to help get up into the cab and less slippery floor mats to ensure you stay in the cab. >>",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford Bronco?\n\nThe Ford Bronco is an off-road-oriented mid-size SUV available in two- and four-door convertible body styles, with a 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or a 330-hp, twin-turbo V-6 engine. The four-cylinder can be paired with a seven-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission, while the punchier V-6 comes solely with the automatic. Also available is a high-performance four-door-only Bronco Raptor, which is powered by a 418-hp, twin-turbo V-6 and features a full roster of go-anywhere hardware. The list includes a reinforced chassis, elevated suspension, upgraded shocks, extra-wide fender flares and more.\n\nFour-wheel drive is standard across the Bronco’s many trim levels. There are a number of available hard- and soft-top configurations to choose from, and like its main rival, the Jeep Wrangler, the retro-themed Bronco allows you to remove the doors for the ultimate open-air experience. For shoppers who want the Bronco’s badge and attitude in a more city-friendly, “off-road-lite” package, Ford offers the smaller Bronco Sport, which is based on the same platform as Ford’s Escape compact SUV. The Honda Passport, Toyota 4Runner and Toyota Land Cruiser also compete with the Bronco. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford Bronco?\n\nThe Bronco receives a few alterations to packages, trims and interior features for 2025. As part of a trim-level reshuffling, the base trim level returns and two nostalgic special editions — the Stroppe Edition two-door and the Free Wheeling four-door — join the line. A Black Appearance Package for select trims includes black plastic mirror caps, fender flares, door handles and grille, as well as a special black graphics package and a black-painted hard top. A 12-inch digital gauge cluster is now standard, as is additional interior lighting and more sound insulation. All four-door Broncos now come standard with rear-seat air vents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford Bronco Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12-inch touchscreen\n12-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSatellite radio\nSeven-speaker stereo\nKeyless entry\nVinyl upholstery\nRubber flooring\nLED headlights with automatic high beams\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFull-time 4WD\nFull underbody skid plate\nRock rails\nSteel bumpers\nFront winch\nLocking front and rear differentials\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nNavigation\n12-inch touchscreen\n35-inch off-road tires\n37-inch off-road tires (Raptor)\nHeavy-duty skid plates\nFox shock absorbers\nWireless device charging\nSurround-view parking camera\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford Bronco?\n\nThe Bronco makes a strong case for itself as a rugged SUV adept at traversing rocks, mud, sand and other terrain that would leave most SUVs stranded — all with a fun-loving, retro attitude that makes its shortcomings in an everyday commute a bit more palatable. Across the model lineup, it’s a worthy rival to the Wrangler. While the super-performance Raptor trim is more than twice the price of a standard Bronco, it’s a formidable force if high-speed, go-anywhere adventuring is a top priority; it’s also more tractable in day-to-day driving than you might expect.\n\nThe Bronco’s wide range of trims and options means it can be tailored to suit a variety of tastes, budgets and use cases. It rides and handles smaller than its bulky proportions suggest, but there’s no getting around the fact the Bronco is a whole lot of truck to handle — especially if you won’t regularly make use of its off-road capabilities.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 Bronco Raptor delivers on just about every promise Ford made when the off-road SUV debuted, with incredible off-the-lot capabilities that seem up to tackling almost anything owners can throw at it.\n\nVersus the competition: The Bronco Raptor has the specs and abilities to match or beat the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 off-road, and it can more than hold its own on-road, too.\n\nFord used to have the high-performance, factory off-road market cornered with the F-150 Raptor, but in the last few years, Stellantis — parent company of Jeep and Ram — has one-upped the Blue Oval with vehicles like the Wrangler Rubicon 392 and Ram 1500 TRX. Both vehicles subscribe to the “put a powerful V-8 in it and it’ll be fine” way of thinking, while Ford has taken a different route with the F-150 Raptor by giving it incredible off-road prowess but dropping its V-8 engine for a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. Though Ford has ceded the horsepower war for now, the automaker has confirmed that an F-150 Raptor R, powered by a V-8, is on its way.\n\nRelated: ​​2022 Ford Bronco Raptor: Could This Be the Perfect Raptor?\n\nThe Bronco Raptor makes more horsepower and torque than the regular Bronco courtesy of a larger twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine, and the Raptor version is so significantly upgraded that the two barely look alike. But is it worthy of the Raptor name? To find out, we traveled to Palm Springs, Calif., at Ford’s invitation to drive it on- and off-road. (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nDriving the Bronco Raptor on the Street\n\nLike the F-150 Raptor, the Bronco Raptor is a sloppy kind of fun on pavement; it’s not perfect, but it’s not meant to be. The twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 producing 418 horsepower and 440 pounds-feet of torque makes the Bronco Raptor feel quick but not blindingly fast. The 10-speed automatic transmission shifts smartly.\n\nSteering feel and handling are significantly improved over the regular Bronco, too. The Bronco Raptor has a much more advanced suspension with heavier-duty components borrowed from the F-150 Raptor, upgraded steering components, increased rigidity and significantly increased track widths of 73.2 inches in front and 73.6 inches at the rear. That’s a whopping 8.2 inches wider in front and 8.6 inches wider in back versus a base Bronco. The Bronco Raptor’s brakes are also borrowed from the F-150 Raptor and do an admirable job of uneventfully bringing this 5,700-plus-pound SUV to a stop. All the tweaks to turn a Bronco into a Bronco Raptor have also resulted in a maximum towing capacity of 4,500 pounds, a 1,000-pound increase.\n\nThe V-6’s adjustable exhaust note leaves a lot to be desired even in its loudest Baja setting. The Sport drive mode includes aggressive downshifting and automated throttle blips as you decelerate, but the engine sound simply isn’t as pleasing as the throaty rumble of a V-8. There’s also a fair amount of road and wind noise in the cabin, though it’s worth remembering that the Bronco’s doors and roof are removable; it’s a fair trade to me. The standard 37-inch BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires are fairly quiet at speed, too, which isn’t always the case with off-road tires.\n\nVisibility is an issue, with the Bronco’s large front windshield pillars restricting the driver’s view when cornering. The giant full-size, rear-mounted spare tire and taillight assembly is big enough to hide entire cars. It can make highway driving feel fraught when you’re in the passing lane because you can’t tell if someone is right behind you.\n\nFuel efficiency is probably low on the list of concerns for Bronco Raptor buyers, but with gas prices near record highs, it’s worth knowing what you’re signing up for with this SUV. It’s EPA-rated at 15/16/15 mpg city/highway/combined, and Ford recommends more expensive premium gas. Lowly though those ratings may seem, they still mostly best the Wrangler Rubicon 392, which requires premium and is EPA-rated at 13/17/14 mpg.\n\nWho Cares About on the Street? What About Off-Road?\n\nYou probably won’t be surprised to learn that the Bronco Raptor feels incredibly capable off-road, equally adept at high-speed desert running and low-speed rock crawling. I got a chance to beat the hell out of the Bronco Raptor and never felt like I was even close to reaching its limits. What impressed me about this experience, however, was that we drove on regular off-road trails as opposed to an off-road loop specifically created for the event. It’s never shocking when a vehicle completes a course made just for it, but that wasn’t the case here.\n\nAt low speeds, the Bronco Raptor is nimble and, for the most part, easily managed. Modulating the gas pedal is fairly easy, though in Rock Crawl and 4-Low, it sometimes lurches forward as the transmission upshifts into 2nd gear. For more technical sections, it might be wise to put the transmission into Manual and hold it in 1st gear.\n\nThe Bronco Raptor also comes standard with all the off-road goodies of the regular Bronco, including Trail One-Pedal driving and Trail Control off-road “cruise control,” as well as the nifty Trail Turn Assist. The one-pedal feature was useful on tricky downhill sections, but two-footing it was easy, too.\n\nThe Bronco Raptor’s ground clearance is 13.1 inches — 4.8 inches more than a base Bronco and 1.6 inches more than a Bronco with the Sasquatch Package. It’s also 2 inches greater than a Wrangler Rubicon 392 with the Xtreme Recon Package, or 0.2 inch more than a regular Wrangler Rubicon with the package. The Bronco Raptor’s approach, departure and breakover angles are 47.2, 40.5 and 30.8 degrees, respectively. A base four-door Bronco is 35.5, 29.7 and 20 degrees, and the Sasquatch increases them to 43.2, 37 and 26.3 degrees. Wrangler Rubicons with the Xtreme Recon Package are either 47.4, 40.4 and 26.7 degrees without the 392 V-8 or 46.7, 39.8 and 24.5 degrees with it.\n\nThe biggest hindrance to slow-speed off-roading in the Bronco Raptor is a familiar problem for vehicles bearing the Raptor name: It’s wide. It’s nearly as wide as the F-150 Raptor, in fact, measuring 86.9 inches wide with the side mirrors out and 85.7 inches with them folded. The F-150 Raptor is 86.6 inches wide with its mirrors folded and 96 inches wide with them extended. Xtreme Recon Wranglers, meanwhile, are 79.3 inches wide.\n\nLike the F-150 Raptor, the Bronco Raptor is legally required to have marker lights because of its extreme width. In practical terms, this means you could end up in some tight situations off-road or get free pinstriping from local flora. However, the Bronco Raptor’s wheelbase is 116.5 inches, or nearly 30 inches shorter than the F-150 Raptor’s, which results in much better low-speed maneuverability.\n\nAs good as it is at the low-speed stuff, the Bronco Raptor feels even better when it gets to stretch its legs a little — and with 13 inches of front and 14 inches of rear suspension travel, it really can stretch them. The upgraded HOSS — High-performance, Off-road, Stability, Suspension — 4.0 suspension includes Fox-brand live-valve shocks that are 3.1 inches in diameter and suspension height sensors that take measurements 500 times per second and can then adjust the damping as needed.\n\nSpeeding through the desert, the ride is remarkably controlled for the terrain, and the suspension travel makes bottoming out and hitting the jounce stops an actual challenge. For optimum drivetrain performance, the Bronco Raptor also has a uniquely tuned Baja mode for even more desert-running fun. Besides the loudest active exhaust setting, it activates a specific turbo anti-lag calibration that Ford says increases performance during desert runs. You might even call it a … Baja blast (sorry).\n\nOff-roading at any speed is punishing to a vehicle, and Ford has beefed up the Bronco Raptor’s underpinnings. The regular Bronco has a Dana 44 rear axle, but the Raptor gets a Dana 50 heavy-duty rear axle. The front half-shafts have been upgraded, and there’s more underbody skid plating than on a regular Bronco. After noticing during testing that hitch-receiver covers kept getting lost, Ford even gave the hitch receiver and plugs their own little “beaver tail” to try to prevent that from happening to owners.\n\nLooking Like a Raptor\n\nLooks, subjective though they may be, are part of the Raptor equation. On the outside, that means insane fender flares, beadlock-look wheels (beadlock-capable wheels are optional), fender vents, optional graphics and a functional heat extractor on the hood. It also means a “F-O-R-D” grille design, just like the F-150 Raptor, instead of the traditional Bronco grille. The width and stance are imposing, and the Bronco Raptor dwarfs non-Raptor Broncos — almost comically so.\n\nInside, the interior remains mostly regular Bronco, but with Raptor-specific touches like carbon-fiber and Code Orange accents, as well as unique graphics in the standard digital instrument panel. Despite all the cool graphics and the useful Sync 4 infotainment system with physical controls and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the most important thing during my drive was the Code Orange 12 o’clock stripe on the steering wheel, which helped me keep the front wheels pointed in the correct direction when following the spotters’ directions.\n\nThe interior being mostly Bronco is both good and bad: It feels roomier than a Wrangler, and the control layout is wonderfully intuitive and easy to use, but it doesn’t make the Bronco Raptor feel unique, and the quality is a little below the Jeep’s. There are also convenient grab handles — especially useful during high-speed off-roading.\n\nOne of my favorite trends among automakers is the inclusion of “Easter eggs” — fun, little details and surprises — in and/or on vehicles, and the Bronco Raptor has some nice ones, including the years a Bronco won the Baja 1000 on the heat extractor vents and the coordinates for Johnson Valley, Calif., where the Bronco Raptor was developed and where I drove it. There are many others, as well, so good luck finding them.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Ford Bronco Raptor: Smaller Size, Different Mission, Still Awesome\nThe Ford Bronco Raptor Is Coming; Here’s What We Want\nWhat Are Approach, Breakover and Departure Angles?\nFord Bronco Vs. Jeep Wrangler: A Wrangler Owner Drives the 2021 Ford Bronco\nIs the 2021 Ford Bronco a Good Car? 6 Pros and 3 Cons\nShould You Buy a Bronco Raptor?\n\nA better question might be “Can you buy a Bronco Raptor?” And the answer is: Probably not — or at least not easily, and likely not for its already hefty starting price of $70,095 (including destination). Orders for the 2022 model are already closed, per Ford’s website.\n\nShould you get in line for a 2023 model, then? I enjoyed my time in the Bronco Raptor so much that it has rocketed up my “cash out my 401(k)” list, but I’d also want to move somewhere where I could get to use its full abilities regularly. That’s the rub with the Bronco Raptor: It lives up to the Raptor name and is so good that not using it properly feels like a real shame to me. Or maybe you just think it looks cool, and that’s enough for you. It might be enough for me, too.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With solid on-road manners and tons of off-road capability straight from the factory, the Ford Bronco should be among the top choices of any shopper looking for a vehicle to take them off the beaten path.\n\nVersus the competition: The only area where the Bronco might lack compared with its competitors is in built-up brand equity and positive name recognition, given that the previous Bronco was last sold in 1996.\n\nThe 2021 Ford Bronco is one of the most hotly anticipated vehicles in recent memory, and pandemic-related delays have only made the waiting worse. (The earlier launch of the Bronco Sport, a smaller vehicle on a separate, unibody platform, has probably made confusion worse.) But the proper body-on-frame Bronco is finally rolling off assembly lines, and I traveled to the Texas Hill Country to drive it both on- and off-road, including at the first Bronco Off-Roadeo about an hour outside of Austin. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2021 Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport First Impressions: More Capable Than Expected?\n\nThe 2021 Ford Bronco has two very small and simple aims: first, to live up to the iconic Bronco name (the part that isn’t associated with police chases) and, second, to challenge the Jeep Wrangler’s position atop the heap of off-roading SUVs. You know, little goals.\n\nThe Bronco is available in seven trim levels, and like the Wrangler, each trim has varying levels of off-roading intent:\n\nBase\nBig Bend\nBlack Diamond\nOuter Banks\nWildtrak\nBadlands\nFirst Edition\n\nUnlike the Wrangler, however, Ford has made the optional Sasquatch Package — adding 35-inch mud-terrain tires, an off-road suspension and more — available on all trim levels. The Wrangler limits all the really good stuff to the Rubicon trim.\n\nNew Old Looks\n\nThe Bronco looks big and bulky in person (in a good way), and its aggressive styling, particularly on Sasquatch-equipped models, hints at its abilities. Retro details like its grille design and round headlights are a nod to the iconic first-generation Bronco, as is the availability of a two-door model. In a Bronco first, however, the new model can also be had as a family-friendlier four-door.\n\nThe new Bronco is longer and wider than the current Wrangler, and can be shorter or taller depending on trim level and equipment. The doors and roof are removable, revealing thick roof pillars that hold standard side-curtain airbags. The doors are cleverly designed for easy removal by a single person, as are the roof panels, but the rear portion of the roof is best done as a two-person job. Ford has storage bags for the removable parts, and instructions for removal are accessible via the digital owner’s manual in the center display or online. There’s a QR code on the bags that took me to Ford’s YouTube page, where I could search for an instructional video there, as well.\n\nWhile the doors are removable, the Bronco’s side mirrors are not attached to the doors. The design gives the Bronco a bit of a Snidely Whiplash or pretentious barista handlebar mustache, but it also means that if you want to drive around with the doors off, you aren’t put in the same spot as Wrangler owners: either not having side mirrors at all or purchasing aftermarket replacements. Also, if you take the doors off in a four-door Bronco, you can bag them up and take them with you.\n\nHighly Functional Interior\n\nThe Bronco’s interior layout keeps important controls within easy reach, and those controls are mostly well laid out, clearly labeled and intuitive. The central touchscreen — measuring either 8 or 12 inches, depending on trim level and equipment — uses Sync 4, quickly becoming one of my favorite non-luxury operating systems for its clear graphics and ease of operation. Above the screen are what Ford calls “hero switches,” controls for off-road functions like the available stability bar disconnect, locking front differential, locking rear differential, Trail Turn Assist, traction control and the hazard lights. These rubberized buttons remain within easy reach even when the Bronco is precariously perched on an obstacle, and the labeling makes it easy to find and select your desired function. The only controls I wasn’t really a fan of while driving were the window and side mirror controls, which are positioned behind the gear and drive mode selector, but that’s the price one pays for having removable doors.\n\nSeats can be upholstered in cloth, leather or my personal favorite, marine-grade vinyl that’s mold- and mildew-resistant. The seats themselves are firm, an ongoing issue I’ve had with Ford seats, but the interior feels less cramped than a Wrangler. (And of course it feels downright airy with the doors and roof off.) The vinyl seats are standard on the Black Diamond and Badlands, and are part of a fully washable interior with integrated floor drain plugs. Also present in the Bronco are very sturdy-feeling grab handles for easier entry and for holding onto during rougher portions of a drive. Like the window and mirror controls, the handles aren’t mounted on the doors or roof as they are in most vehicles. One other minor complaint, and this might just be the Texas heat talking, is the lack of ventilated seats as an option.\n\nThe last important interior bit is the selector for the various drive modes, or as Ford calls them, the G.O.A.T. — Goes Over Any Type of Terrain — modes. It also houses the buttons to select two-wheel drive, 4WD High, 4WD Low and 4-Auto, and in its center, the button to activate Trail One-Pedal Drive. We’ll address how those modes work below. The selector itself, however, has a solid feel and, like the hero switches, is easy to use.\n\nWell Mannered on Pavement\n\nMy on-road driving time was limited to a single vehicle, and the one I chose was a Badlands trim level. Its twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 makes 330 horsepower and 415 pounds-feet of torque when using premium gas (those numbers drop by 15 hp and 5 pounds-feet, respectively, with regular gas), and it’s coupled with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The powertrain provides ample power on-road, and I didn’t notice any of the issues we’ve had with other Ford 10-speeds during my driving time. Buyers can also choose a turbo 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine with 300 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque on premium gas (275 and 315, respectively, on regular). The four-cylinder can be paired with either a seven-speed manual transmission with a dedicated creeper gear or the 10-speed auto.\n\nThe Bronco Badlands with the Sasquatch Package, despite its 35-inch off-road tires and off-road suspension, was well mannered and maneuverable on the pavement. There was minimal tire noise, too, which was surprising, and road and wind noise levels were also better than I expected considering the removable roof and doors; even at 55 mph or more with the roof off, conditions were fairly quiet.\n\nOn the other hand, the on-road experience also felt sterile and detached. Maybe I’m too used to off-road SUVs feeling clumsy outside of their natural environment, but the steering seems optimized for off-road use and felt uncommunicative at higher speeds, and the brakes worked well but lacked linearity or solid pedal feel. The on-road driving experience was still much better than any I’ve had in any number of Wranglers, however.\n\nNimble as a Goat Off-Road\n\nMy off-roading in the Bronco consisted of three different trails of increasing difficulty, but the Bronco handled everything we threw at it. In fact, the most impressive bit was actually when a Bronco in our convoy lost all of its various electronic off-road aids mid-trail and had to scale a rock face with nothing but low-range 4WD. It took a lot more effort for it to get over the obstacle, but it did it.\n\nThat’s because even without all the bits that make off-roading easy, the Bronco is a serious machine. With a solid Dana 44 rear axle and Dana AdvanTek front axle, lower trim levels get two-speed electronic shift-on-the-fly 4WD, while higher-end trims get an electromechanical transfer case that adds 4-Auto. Spicer Performa-Trak electronic locking front and rear differentials are available. The underbody of the Bronco has loads of protective plating, and side rock rails capable of supporting the weight of each side of the vehicle are also available. Plus, buyers can add a modular steel bumper that can add an integrated winch.\n\nWithout the Sasquatch Package, the Bronco has approach, departure and breakover angles of 35.5, 29.8 and 21.1 degrees, respectively, as a two-door, and 35.5, 29.7 and 20.0 as a four-door. Going Sasquatch changes those to either 43.2, 37.2 and 29.0 degrees for the two-door or 43.2, 37.0 and 26.3 for the four-door. Ground clearance is 8.4 inches in the base two-door and 8.3 in the base four-door, increasing to 11.6 or 11.5, respectively, with the Sasquatch Package.\n\nThe throttle is mostly very easy to modulate during low-speed off-roading. Ford includes a Trail One-Pedal Driving feature that applies braking force when the driver lets off the accelerator pedal. I found it difficult with that feature engaged not to overapply the throttle at least occasionally, which made clearing obstacles a bit more herky-jerky, but I’m sure with more time a driver could strike the right balance.\n\nTrail Control operates like cruise control for off-roading and handles all the accelerator and brake inputs. Again, I preferred not to use it, mostly because I don’t like ceding that much control to the machine. If you’re comfortable with that, however, it works well, particularly at slowing descents.\n\nMy favorite Bronco party trick is Trail Turn Assist, which works during a turn at speeds up to 12 mph and, once activated, engages when the steering wheel is at full lock (turned all the way in either direction). It applies braking forces to the inside rear wheel and turns it into a fulcrum, allowing for much sharper turns and reducing the need for reversing and multipoint turns to continue along the trail.\n\nThe Bronco also offers a variety of G.O.A.T. driving modes depending on trim level and equipment. There are eight all told, seven for a single SUV: Normal, Eco and Sport for on-road driving; and Slippery, Sand, Mud/Ruts, Rock Crawl and Baja for off-roading (Sport gets replaced by Rock Crawl on Badlands and First Edition trims). Select one and the vehicle will make necessary switches to the two- or four-wheel-drive setting and possibly engage a differential lock, as well.\n\nThe multiple camera systems are also a boon for off-roading, and while I always prefer having a spotter, they can at least partially make up for a lack of one in certain sections. The forward camera is smartly positioned so that you can see what’s ahead of the vehicle as you’re cresting a blind ridge and enables you to properly align your tires for obstacles that are part of the descent. There are additional views available, as well, including a split view with the front camera and an overhead view with dynamic tire lines, and a side-by-side view of the two front tires so you can see exactly what you’re driving over. Also helpful for off-roading are the brackets mounted at the front corners of the Bronco’s fenders. They’re great for helping to aim the Bronco (even in on-road driving) and also double as tie-down points for roof-mounted loads.\n\nAfter sampling a variety of Bronco flavors off-road, my preference for serious off-roading is a two-door model with the Sasquatch Package. Because of its smaller size and shorter wheelbase, the two-door Bronco felt the most nimble.\n\nNone of the obstacles we faced in the Bronco were things a Wrangler couldn’t also do, but that’s kind of the point, isn’t it? The Wrangler is the gold-standard off-roader and, when properly equipped, can take on practically anything. Based on what I’ve seen, a Bronco shouldn’t have any problem keeping up.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for Ford in 2021?\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2021?\nFord Moves Back 2021 Bronco Deliveries to Summer\nFord Listens to Demand, Will Pair Manual Transmission With Bronco Sasquatch Package\nFord Sync 4 Multimedia System Can Find You a Parking Spot, Cheap Gas\nSafety\n\nAnother area where Ford looked at the Wrangler and saw a chance to differentiate the Bronco is safety. You may have noticed that, with the roof off, the Bronco’s roof support structure is quite substantial. That’s because along the sides are standard side curtain airbags. As a convertible, the Bronco is technically exempt from the federal safety standard requiring side curtain airbags, but Ford decided the Bronco should have them anyway. The Wrangler does not. Ford also says the Bronco meets a side impact crush standard from which it would also be exempt. Ford even crash-tested the Bronco with its available winch accessory to ensure that adding it didn’t pose a threat to occupants in a crash.\n\nWhat that does for the Bronco’s safety ratings, however, is unclear. As of this writing, the Bronco hasn’t yet been tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIs the Bronco Better Than the Wrangler?\n\nOn pavement, the Bronco is absolutely the better vehicle. The ride and handling are better and more pleasant. Off-road is a different story and much harder to quantify, but I suspect a Bronco-versus-Wrangler off-road battle would end up like the old McDonald’s commercial where Michael Jordan and Larry Bird played horse.\n\nWhere the Jeep currently has the advantage is in powertrain choice, with the Rubicon 392 performance model, the 4xe plug-in hybrid and EcoDiesel — all options the Bronco can’t currently match. Ford wouldn’t say what the future holds for the Bronco, but with its continued push toward electrification, it seems likely a hybrid or PowerBoost plug-in hybrid could happen.\n\nI think the Wrangler also has better name recognition at the moment, along with decades of extra brand loyalty and community baked into the ownership experience. Ford is looking to challenge that, including via an Off-Roadeo experience included in every Bronco purchase. If you buy a Bronco and can get yourself to one of the locations across the country, Ford will have experienced trail guides help you learn how to get the most out of your Bronco. Even better: The experience won’t be in your Bronco, eliminating some of the inherent fear of damaging a personal vehicle that understandably prevents owners from always getting the most out of their off-roaders.\n\nWith a better, if slightly detached, on-road feel and factory off-road capabilities that would rival a goat’s, the Bronco will certainly give the Wrangler a run for its money. Ford appears all in on the Bronco, and if buyers and shoppers show the same sort of enthusiasm, the Bronco has a chance to make up ground on the Wrangler’s cultural status, too. Will the Bronco ever unseat the Wrangler? I can’t say. But I wouldn’t bet against it.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated June 30, 2021, to reflect that the Sasquatch Package is available on all trims but not standard on any.\n\nRelated Video: 2021 Ford Bronco: First Drive\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford Bronco?\n\nThe 2023 Ford Bronco combines retro design, the choice of a soft top or hard top, two- and four-door body styles, and a 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or 330-hp, twin-turbo V-6. The turbo-four can be paired with a seven-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission, while the turbo V-6 is automatic only. A high-performance, four-door-only Raptor model joined the lineup in the middle of the 2022 model year; it comes standard with a 418-hp, twin-turbo V-6, a seriously revamped off-road suspension and 37-inch all-terrain tires.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ford Bronco?\n\nNew for the 2023 model year are Heritage Edition and Heritage Limited Edition versions of both the two- and four-door Bronco. These include throwback paint colors and wheel designs, plus a white-painted front grille and roof. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ford Bronco Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nStandard hard top (two-door)\nStandard soft top (four-door)\n8-inch infotainment screen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRemovable top and doors\nSatellite radio\nFour USB ports\nHill start assist\nHill descent control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch touchscreen\nRemote start\nHeated front seats\nWaterproof seating\nFloor-mounted drain plugs\n37-inch all-terrain tires\nUnderbody skid plates\nRock rails\nAdaptive cruise control\nWireless device charging\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ford Bronco?\n\nThe Ford Bronco pushes all the right buttons for SUV shoppers who want go-anywhere capability paired with classic design. It is, however, a lot of truck, and its size and thirst for fuel make it an acquired taste if you just need an SUV to get you from point A to point B. If that’s the case, the smaller, more agile Bronco Sport may be a better choice for your driving needs and budget.",
