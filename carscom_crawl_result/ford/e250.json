      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord’s full-size E-Series cargo-hauling Van and passenger-carrying Wagon gained electronic throttle control as a standard feature for 2005. A QuietFlex Racks and Bins system was available as a no-charge option.\n\nA 4.6-liter V-8 is the base engine. All 2006 models gain a slim-line engine cover console. An electronically controlled four-speed-automatic transmission is now standard on all models.\n\nFormerly called the Econoline, the rear-wheel-drive E-150 comes in only one size. Passenger versions are sold in XL, XLT and Chateau Wagon trim levels. Heavier-duty models — the three-quarter-ton E-250 and one-ton E-350 Super Duty — are also available.\n(Skip to details on the: E-250 | E-350 Super Duty)\n\nExterior\nOffered in one length, both the E-150 Van and Wagon have a 138-inch wheelbase and stretch to 212 inches long overall. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are installed on the right side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice at the rear.\n\nChrome bumpers and aerodynamic headlamps are mounted on the XLT. The Chateau edition features aluminum wheels and running boards, as well as two-tone paint.\n\nInterior\nAimed at commercial applications, the cargo-hauling Van is fitted with two bucket seats up front. Passenger models have seating for eight occupants on two front buckets and a pair of three-passenger bench seats. Captain’s chairs in the Chateau version replace the center bench, reducing seating positions to seven. Air conditioning, interval wipers and a tilt steering wheel are standard. The XLT adds carpeting, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors. An overhead console and keyless entry are included in the Chateau Wagon.\n\nCargo volume in the E-150 is 236.5 cubic feet. An optional cargo organizer can be installed behind the rear bench seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo engines are available for the E-150. The base engine is a 225-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8. Stepping up a notch is a 255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8. Each drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the E-150 Van can tow as much as 6,900 pounds, which is 400 pounds more than the equivalent E-150 passenger Wagon.\n\nSafety\nAll E-Series models have dual front airbags. Four-wheel all-disc antilock brakes and front seat belt pretensioners are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAfter a few minutes behind the wheel, it’s nearly possible to forget the E-150’s truck origins. Engine drone is less noticeable than in Ford vans of the distant past. With relatively light steering, an E-150 maneuvers almost as easily as a smaller van. On the other hand, more effort is necessary when parking the van and when judging your position on the highway.\n\nThe 5.4-liter V-8 is strong enough to deliver satisfying and safe response. Ride quality is decent, but it’s not as well cushioned as most minivans. Compared with many smaller vans, the E-150 demands more steering correction on straightaways, but it’s reasonably stable. Drivers enjoy a commanding view, and getting in and out isn’t too difficult despite the high stance. �\n\nE-250\nRated for heavier duty than the E-150, the E-250 Van has the same engine choices but comes in both regular and extended lengths. Extended vans are 20 inches longer overall but have the same 138-inch wheelbase; maximum cargo volume is 275.1 cubic feet. The maximum gross vehicle weight rating for the E-250 is 8,600 pounds, versus a 7,000-pound GVWR for the E-150. Passenger Wagons aren’t available in this series. For 2006, a transmission cooler is standard on E-250 models. Back to top�\n\nE-350 Super Duty\nAvailable in regular and extended lengths, the E-350 Super Duty has a maximum GVWR of 9,500 pounds. Cutaway versions are also available. The regular-length E-350 seats seven, eight, 11 or 12 people; extended-length vans seat 11, 12, 14 or 15 occupants.\n\nDuring the 2004 model year, a 6.0-liter Power Stroke V-8 diesel rated at 235 hp and 440 pounds-feet of torque replaced the prior 7.3-liter diesel engine. Optional in the E-350, it mates with a five-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. The standard E-350 engine is a 5.4-liter V-8, but a 6.8-liter V-10 that generates 305 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque can be installed.\n\nFor 2005, a new powertrain control module was installed that allows elevated idle speed in order to operate accessories. AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control goes into 2006 wagons with 12- or 15-person capacity. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe E-Series received new front-end styling similar to Ford’s full-size SuperDuty trucks in 2008, with a large front grille and squared-off highlights. The E-Series is available as a passenger wagon that can carry up to 15 people and a commercial van version that offers up to 275 cubic feet of cargo space. Formerly called the Econoline, the rear-wheel-drive E-150 comes in only one size. Passenger versions are sold in XL, XLT and XLT Premium Wagon trim levels. The E-150 competes with the Chevrolet Express and Dodge Sprinter.\n\n(Skip to details on the: E-250, E-350 and E-450 Super Duty)\n\nNew for 2009\nFor 2009, the E-Series gets a redesigned instrument panel that includes four new upfitter switches, optional factory-installed navigation, V-8 engines that are E-85 capable, and rear doors that swing out 172 degrees.\n\nExterior\nOffered in one length, both the E-150 van and wagon have a 138-inch wheelbase and are 216.7 inches long overall — much shorter than the Dodge Sprinter. Swing-out 60/40-split doors are installed on the right side, but a sliding cargo door is available as a no-cost option. Swing-out doors are the only choice in the rear.\n\nNew rear-door system allows 95-degree opening, but with a light push the opening can increase to 172 degrees\nAvailable chrome bumpers and aerodynamic headlights\n\nInterior\nAimed at commercial applications, the cargo-hauling van is fitted with two bucket seats up front. Passenger models have seating for eight occupants on two front buckets and a pair of three-passenger bench seats. Captain’s chairs in the XLT Premium version replace the center bench, reducing seating positions to seven.

Suspension components were upgraded for 2008, and the E-Series now has heavier-duty sway bars and larger brakes. Two engines are available for the E-150, both of which are now E85-capable in the cargo van versions.\n\n225-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 with 286 pounds-feet of torque\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\nStandard four-speed automatic with overdrive\nOptional five-speed automatic with TorqShift that maximizes low-speed torque\n\nSafety\nThe E-Series adds a few more safety features to its list, including a new optional, dash-mounted front passenger airbag cutoff. The 2009 E-Series has a three-star (average) rating in rollover testing, even with standard electronic stability control.\n\nDual front airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nTraction control and electronic stability control (standard on all wagons and recreational vans, optional on commercial vans with gasoline engines)\nNewly available rearview backup camera\nOptional factory-installed integrated trailer brake controller\nSide-impact airbags not available\n\nE-250\nRated for heavier duty than the E-150, the E-250 has the same engine choices but comes in both regular and extended lengths. Extended vans are 20 inches longer overall but have the same 138-inch wheelbase; maximum cargo volume is 275.1 cubic feet. The maximum gross vehicle weight rating for the E-250 is 8,900 pounds versus a 8,520-pound gross vehicle weight rating for the E-150. Passenger wagons aren’t available in this series.\n\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\n\nE-350 and E-450 Super Duty\nAvailable in regular and extended lengths, the 350 Super Duty van has a maximum GVW of 9,500 pounds. Cutaway versions that can be used for motor homes and box vans have a GVW of 14,500 pounds. Single- and dual-rear-wheel trims are available. The E-350 passenger wagon can seat seven, eight, 11 or 12 people; extended-length vans seat 11, 12, 14 or 15 occupants.\n\nThe standard E-350 engine is a 5.4-liter V-8, and E-350 models with the 5.4-liter come standard with an electronic stability system. A 6.8-liter V-10 that generates 305 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque can be installed with a five-speed automatic transmission in either model. E-450 extended passenger wagons can tow up to 10,000 pounds.\n\n255-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 with 350 pounds-feet of torque (E150, E250, E350, E450)\n305-hp, 6.8-liter V-10 with 420 pounds-feet of torque (E-350 van/wagon)\n235-hp, 6.0-liter diesel V-8 with 440 pounds-feet of torque (E-350 van, E-350/E-450 cutaway)\n\n(Back to top)",
