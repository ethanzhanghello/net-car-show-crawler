      "expert_review": "I drove a preproduction Ford Flex earlier in the summer, and I was impressed with the large interior and family-friendly functionality. Now, after a week with a production model, my first impressions have been reinforced.\n\nEven though Ford calls the Flex a crossover vehicle, it is functionally a contemporary station wagon, albeit one that has almost as much room as a minivan. The wheelbase is 117.9 inches and overall length is 201.8 inches. Those dimensions are similar to the Dodge Grand Caravan or Honda Odyssey.\n\nThe Flex is intentionally boxy. The roof is flat and long, and comes only in silver or white. The trim around the windows is black on all models. The sides of the body have grooves that give it a high-tech look and disguises the height of the side panels. Ford acknowledges that the styling is polarizing, but most people who looked at the test vehicle responded positively.\n\nThe Flex is available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Base prices begin at $28,295 for an SE and top out at $36,555 for an all-wheel-drive Limited, which is the vehicle I drove. Its sticker price was $43,820.\n\nThe interior of the Flex has been designed to serve families on the go. There is seating for seven, an optional refrigerator in the console between the second-row bucket seats, and third-row seats that fold flat into the cargo floor. The test vehicle was also equipped with a Vista Roof that contains a front sliding sunroof and three glass panels over the rear seats.\n\nI noticed that the Flex felt large and a bit bulky in everyday driving with one or two persons aboard, something that didn’t grab my attention earlier in the summer.\n\nPower comes from Ford’s 3.5-liter V-6. This engine has 262 horsepower that provides reasonable vigor considering the Flex’s 4,640-pound curb weight. This engine’s midrange torque seems a little soft, especially when you accelerate onto the highway to keep up with rapidly flowing traffic. Ford has a 3.7-liter version of this engine in the Lincoln MKS. The 3.7-liter provides more midrange torque and stronger acceleration. Hopefully the Flex will get this engine, too.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive model is rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 22 on the highway. The front-wheel drive model is rated at 17 mpg in the city and 24 on the highway.\n\nThe front seats are quite comfortable, and the optional adjustable pedals make it easy for drivers of all sizes to find just the right position.\n\nThe test vehicle was equipped with the navigation system, backup camera and Ford Sync, an application that offers hands-free operation of cell phones and music players. Bluetooth technology allows communication with up to six phones, and a USB port in the console connects directly to an MP3 player. Songs can be stored on the vehicle’s hard disc.\n\nThe navigation system is a huge improvement over previous Ford systems, and a split-screen function allows the driver to see a portion of the map along with the audio selection and outside temperature on the 8-inch LCD screen.\n\nThe Sirius satellite radio offers real-time traffic and weather updates as well as price information for more than 120,000 gas stations.\n\nThe second-row seats have gigantic legroom when pushed all the way back, but that impinges on third-seat legroom. Second-row legroom is adequate even when the seat is moved forward enough to enable adults to ride in the third seat.\n\nThe console refrigerator is large enough to hold seven 12-ounce cans, four half-liter bottles or two 20-ounce bottles. They can be cooled to 41 degrees in 2.5 hours.\n\nThe cup holders and foot wells are lit by lights that can be displayed in one of seven colors.\n\nThe Flex is the first vehicle to use a capless fuel filler that Ford says provides a better seal and reduces the release of smog-forming vapors.\n\nWhether you think of the Flex as a crossover or a new version of the traditional people mover, its function is more important than what you call it.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $36,555. Options included power second-row seats, Vista Roof, second-row console, refrigerator, navigation system, back-up camera and two-tone roof. The sticker price was $43,820.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Ford Flex Limited AWD Engine: 3.5-liter, 262-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 117.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,640 lbs.\n\nBase price: $36,555\n\nAs driven: $43,820\n\nMPG rating: 16 city, 22 hwy\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2013 Ford Flex. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere are few cars these days that fulfill my complex family needs without making me feel like a frumpy shadow of my pre-mom self (you know, the woman who used to shower every single day, no questions asked). But some still pull it off.\n\nDespite some dysfunction in the 2013 Ford Flex’s second-row bench seat, it can haul my entire family, and then some, and make me feel like a hip urbanite while doing it.\n\nThe 2013 Flex comes in four trim levels — the SE, SEL, Limited and Limited with EcoBoost — with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive, depending on the trim level (see them side by side here). The Flex has been updated slightly from 2012, including an improved, sleeker-looking front end. See the two model years compared side by side.\n\nThe Flex comes in both a six- and a seven-seat version. My all-wheel-drive SEL test car was the seven-seat version, which I’ll try to sway you away from (see the details in a recent post). If the Flex’s bold styling just isn’t for your family, you may also want to consider the slightly more conventional-looking Chevy Traverse and Mazda CX-9.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Flex alternately looks like a retro woodless woodie and something I could imagine bouncing down the strip on hydraulics to a thumping beat that you feel more than hear. While I love the Flex’s unmistakably boxy exterior, I just can’t decide if its looks echo my own personality. Maybe I just need to layer on some more bling and crank the bass a little louder.\n\nThe Flex’s low stance accomplishes more than just an aggressive, low-rider look. It creates an exceptionally functional low step-in height. The height is perfect for me to slide right into the driver’s seat without having to crouch down to avoid the roofline or climb up into, like most SUVs. All three of my children (ages 7, 9 and 12) could easily get in and out without snagging their ballet tights. The Flex’s friendly step-in height would also function incredibly well for families in the sandwich generation who care not only for their young children, but also aging parents with decreasing mobility.\n\nOur Flex SEL’s power liftgate was a $1,000 option (it’s not available on the SE but comes standard on the Limited trim level). While it’s a great feature for families, I don’t love the button’s location when the gate is raised — low on the pillar in the cargo area. The push, duck and run maneuver that my kids did to close the gate without getting bumped was a little nerve-racking. I’d rather have the button up high on the cargo door, as it is in many vehicles, so the kids aren’t tempted to try on their own. Of course, the power liftgate comes with pinch protection and raises back up if something or someone is in its way.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe standard second-row bench seat in my test car proved to be more of a hindrance than anything else. With my two youngest kids still in Britax high-back booster seats, the most natural place for them is in the outboard seating positions. Because access to the third row is typically granted by folding and flipping the smaller portion of the 60/40-split bench seat forward, a booster seat in this position effectively blocks access to the third row. My 12-year-old daughter wasn’t a fan of trying to hurdle the bench seat to get to the third row, so she often settled for squeezing herself between the two booster seats, with one cheek on top of the seat belt buckle.\n\nSecond-row captain’s chairs with room for someone to pass between them is a much better option. Also, the bench seat is stationary, whereas the optional captain’s chairs slide back and forth to create additional legroom in either the second or third row, depending on where it’s needed. Despite that, there was plentiful legroom in the second row for all of my girls, even behind my husband’s front seat, which he pushes all the way back to make space for his long legs. Captain’s chairs aren’t available on the base Flex. They’re a $650 option on the SEL, and they run $750 on the Limited.\n\nThe rest of the Flex interior is quite well-thought-out and designed for big families. Countless nooks and crannies throughout the Flex help you stay organized. Up front, a large center console includes two cupholders for the front occupants, and additional cupholders extend backward for second-row passengers. A discreet pass-through storage compartment at the base of the main control stack was a great place to stash a bunch of extra napkins and wet wipes for the inevitable family mess. Other organizer’s delights include a deep storage bin lined in grippy material in front of the gearshift and a little lined storage bin just to the right of the driver’s knee.\n\nFor second-row passengers, bottle/cupholders are up high in the doors themselves, making it very easy for little ones strapped in child-safety seats or booster seats to reach their drinks or sippy cups. Additional storage in the bottom portion of all four doors and pockets on the front seatbacks keep books and such nearby.\n\nWith air vents in all three rows and the ability to control the climate in the back of the vehicle independently from the front, everyone stayed cool and content even on 100-plus-degree days. I could either operate the rear A/C myself from up front or let the kids monkey with it via controls on the back of the center console.\n\nThere’s plenty of cargo space behind the raised third-row seat thanks to the recessed floor. However, the deep well extends underneath the seats. If a can of chickpeas rolls out of your grocery bag, you may be flat out of luck for that hummus you were planning on making. (Or, like me, you could get your littlest child to climb in there and try to reach her arm under the seat to hunt for it.)\n\nThe third-row seat splits 50/50 and folds flat manually via an overly complicated system of pull-straps. Pull strap 1 to release and fold the head restraint, then pull strap 1 again and press the seatback forward. Next, pull strap 2 to release the seat cushion while simultaneously pulling the last strap to tumble the seat into the deep well. Next, load your stuff into the cargo area while simultaneously juggling fiery bowling pins. And if you want that seat to tumble backward to become a tailgating seat, don’t even try.\n\nOr, you can opt for power-folding seats, which are available on Limited trims.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDriving the all-wheel-drive Flex SEL with its 285-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and estimated 17/23 mpg city/highway was quite a bit more fun than I expected it to be. It had plenty of power around town and just enough over hills and while getting up to speed on the highway. For those wanting more, the 365-hp Flex Limited with EcoBoost will decidedly up the “oomph” factor. Its EPA rating is 16/23 mpg. The most efficient Flex is the front-drive model with the 3.5-liter V-6, which is rated 18/25 mpg. The Flex has virtually no body roll in corners, like you typically experience in SUVs and minivans. Excessive body roll is a pet peeve of mine because it tends to toss smaller passengers from one side of their seat belt to the other, causing aggravation and motion sickness. The Flex’s smooth, solid ride quality was pure pleasure for the entire family on both short and long outings.\n\nWhile the Flex is a huge vehicle, I noticed its size more once it was parked in my garage than I did while driving it. It felt much smaller to drive than it actually is, and while our other editors have noted a poor turning circle, the Flex’s 40.8-foot turning diameter is barely larger than the Chevrolet Traverse’s 40.4 feet.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has categorized the Flex a Top Safety Pick, reflecting the highest rating of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength tests, as well as seat and head restraint protection against neck injuries in rear crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Flex four out of five stars for rollover resistance, which is typical for this class. NHTSA has not performed crash tests on the 2013 Flex.\n\nAs is required of all new vehicles starting with the 2012 model year, the 2013 Flex has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. The Flex comes with standard front airbags and front-seat-mounted side impact airbags, along with side curtain airbags for all three rows.\n\nMy test vehicle also came equipped with optional outboard inflatable seat belts in the second row. In the event of a crash, these inflate to spread the force of the impact across a wider surface area on the passenger, lessening potential torso injuries and abrasions. While I absolutely love these in theory, the reality is that they still need some refining in order to be more family-friendly. The thick, double-ply seat belt webbing was stiff and difficult for all three of my kids to maneuver. This, combined with the stationary chunky seat belt buckle, resulted in a struggle for my kids to buckle in independently.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats, there are two sets of Latch lower anchors in the second row’s outboard positions. For Latches on flexible nylon webbing, which are usually more accessible, these ones are a bit of a struggle, as they’re buried in the seat bight. There is a third set of lower Latch anchors on the curb side of the third row. These are open, visible and easy to use.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",

This three-row SUV has positioned itself as the anti-minivan.\n\nThe 2013 Ford Flex is so stylish and edgy that you almost forget it’s also practical: It seats six or seven people comfortably and still offers a decent amount of cargo space.\n\nFor 2013, the Flex maintains the family-friendliness and gains an even edgier exterior look, a more powerful base V-6 engine and improved fuel economy. The new engine delivers an additional 20 horsepower with its 3.5-liter V-6 over the 2012’s model engine.\n\nThis SUV offers a unique driving experience that takes some getting used to. Rectangular in shape, driving the Flex feels a bit awkward around corners and not incredibly agile.\n\nThe 2013 Ford Flex has a starting price of $31,710, including an $825 destination charge. My test car, the midlevel Flex SEL with all-wheel drive, had a starting price of $36,000, but the as-tested price was $39,195.\n\nEXTERIOR\nMany of the 2013 Flex’s changes are on the outside. The SUV’s name is stretched across the front and rear ends of the car to remind everyone in the carpool lane that your vehicle choice is iconoclastic. That and it could be used as an eye chart if ever the need arises. The front end is slightly curvier than previous model years, though you might not notice if you hadn’t been told, and dual exhaust pipes now come standard across the lineup.\n\nMy test car was done up in a monochromatic Tuxedo Black paint color. Monochromatic is the standard paint scheme and it looked fine — “Like a spy car,” my son proclaimed — but if I were buying one, I’d cough up the extra $395 for the two-toned paint job. The two-toned look is where the Flex made a name for itself, and it’s where the Flex first grabs your attention.\n\nBecause it sits low to the ground, the Flex is a breeze for little ones to climb in and out of, though the doors are on the heavy side for children. The liftgate also is on the heavy side, but a power liftgate is available and recommended for those of you who constantly have your hands full.\n\nRear cargo space with all three rows in use is an impressive 20 cubic feet, and there’s a recessed storage well underneath the cargo-floor cover. This is about half the size of the average minivan’s cargo area, but it’s better than many three-row crossovers; a smaller cargo area is also known as the price of being too cool for school (and a minivan). With the third row down, cargo volume rises to 43.2 cubic feet, and with the second row folded, it goes up to 83.2 cubic feet.\n\nThe Flex comes standard with 17-inch wheels on the base model, 18-inch wheels on the SEL and 19-inchers on the Limited trims. Even 20-inchers are available. Automatic headlamps, heated power side mirrors, fog lamps and keyless entry are also standard features.\n\nThe 2013 Flex comes standard with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 285 hp; it’s paired to a standard six-speed automatic transmission and uses regular unleaded gas. With front-wheel drive, this V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg city/highway. My test car came with all-wheel drive, an option that decreases fuel economy slightly to 17/23 mpg. An optional 355-hp, turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 uses premium gas and gets 16/23 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThough it may not translate into the most agile handling, the Ford Flex’s boxy exterior does make for a roomy interior. Head and shoulder room are plentiful, and even the third row has the ability to fit normal-sized adults. Seat cushions have been upgraded for 2013 and seating is exceptionally comfortable in all positions, especially the driver’s and front passenger’s seats.\n\nIf you decide to buy a Flex, the biggest decision you’ll have to make is whether you want it to seat six or seven passengers. My test car could seat seven, thanks to the second row’s standard bench seat. Normally, I’m all about more seating capacity, but with a 60/40-split bench seat in the second row, third-row access is difficult. The second-row seats tumble forward, but that can’t be done with a child-safety seat installed on the seat. If you have children in safety seats and if you ever want adults to sit in the third row, opt for the optional captain’s chairs in the second row. This way, there is a small aisle to access the third row, and the captain’s chairs slide back and forth (the bench does not) to allow for increased third-row legroom.\n\nThe Flex has six cupholders and four in-door bottleholders; the second row’s bottleholders sit just below the window, where buckled-in passengers can easily grab their drinks. The center console isn’t huge, and there’s an excess of space above and around the glove box that could have been used for extra storage.\n\nMyFord Touch (standard at the SEL trim level and optional on the entry-level trim), which supplements the voice-activated Sync multimedia system, is theoretically great with its ability for full integration of smartphones and other devices. It supposedly can receive and read your text messages to you. However, the system’s 8-inch touch-screen with minimalist touch-sensitive “buttons” (really just arrows on the touch-screen) can be prickly and not always immediately responsive. Moreover, I’m still unsure whether I fully understand how to use everything the system has on offer.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Ford Flex has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. In rollover crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2013 Flex received four stars out of five. It hasn’t yet undergone NHTSA’s other crash tests.\n\nThe 2013 Flex has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with anti-roll control, traction control, rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. Ford’s MyKey is also standard and a great feature for parents of teens. It enables parents to program one key with volume and speed limits along with seat-belt-usage reminders.\n\nAll-wheel drive, a backup camera with parking sensors and Active Park Assist, which helps you parallel park the car, are optional. Other available safety features are inflatable seat belts for the second row’s outboard seats, blind spot and forward collision warning systems, and cross-traffic alert.\n\nThere are three sets of lower Latch anchors, with two sets in the second row and a third set in the third row. I really wish more automakers with three-row crossovers would follow the Flex’s example in this regard. All of the Latch anchors are easy to access.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Ford Flex here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford Flex?\n\nThe Flex is one of three Ford crossovers and SUVs with three rows of seats (the Explorer and Expedition are the other two). Depending on the configuration, the Flex seats six or seven people. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available, and a 287-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 is standard. The all-wheel-drive Limited trim offers an available 365-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. The Flex competes with the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford Flex?\n\nActive park assist, which helps with parallel and perpendicular parking, is now a stand-alone option. A universal garage door opener is standard in Limited versions and available on the SEL.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford Flex Are Most Important?\n\nThe Flex is sold in three trims: SE, SEL and Limited. Standard features on the SE include manual air conditioning, cloth seats, a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a 60/40-split, folding second-row bench seat, a 50/50-split, folding third row, Sync multimedia and 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nUplevel options include a power liftgate, panoramic glass roof, power-adjustable pedals, navigation, Sony stereo, heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, and a power-folding third row. Available active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning. Inflatable second-row seat belts are optional.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford Flex?\n\nWith its wagonlike shape and lower ride height, the Flex is an outlier in the world of three-row crossover SUVs. It offers a comfortable cabin and good ride quality, but it’s now in its 11th model year; it hasn’t seen a significant revamp since its 2009 debut. Still, if you don’t want a minivan but aren’t a fan of traditional SUVs, either, you might want to check out the Flex.",

      "expert_review": "I’m just gonna come out and say it: The Ford Flex is one of my most favorite cars on the road. I love that it looks completely different from everything else out there. I love that it drives smoothly and quietly and now, with the EcoBoost engine, powerfully. I love how comfy it is and how well it accommodates my life. I love the Sync system that listens to me better than my kids ever have. Sure, it’s not perfect or cheap, but the Flex rolled with my family and all our life throws at us and never blinked.\n\nIt’s an almost impossible combination of SUV, wagon and minivan that makes the Flex so easy to work with. My test model had all-wheel drive, so I had all the stability and security of an SUV, without the high climb or the roly-poly feeling in the turns. It was easy for my kids to climb in and out of it like a wagon, but it had a third row like a minivan. It seats seven, but looks cool, with an available two-tone exterior and retro styling. I know, I’m gushing, but honestly, the Flex may be the perfect family hauler.\n\nThe Flex rides really smoothly and quietly, even at highway speeds; turns and curves are just as smooth. The new 355-horsepower, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 works like a turbo engine without the two-part acceleration, sending extra power through the V-6 so it feels more like a V-8. The EcoBoost engine is on SEL and Limited models with all-wheel drive. I gave the EcoBoost engine a run through some of our local hills here in the Los Angeles area and passing on an incline was no big deal.\n\nIn tight quarters, the Flex was less flexible. It’s somewhat cumbersome in parking lots. In fact, the grocery store parking lot is where I remembered that the Flex is actually a pretty big car.\n\nOne of my favorite new features is the optional Active Park Assist ($550). It seems like a gimmick, but it works like magic. Magic, I tell you! Active Park Assist parallel parks the Flex with no help from you, just your foot on the brake. I know how to parallel park my car. Sometimes I need some back-and-forth movements to fit into a tight spot, but I’m pretty capable unless I have to park on a one-way street on the left-hand side. Then I’m completely hopeless. But the Flex parks faster and smoother then I ever have. Push the button as you look for a spot, and the Flex alerts you when it’s found one. Then put the car in reverse, let go of the wheel and manage the brakes while the Flex does all the work. Zip, zoom, done. Magic.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Flex’s look is what the marketing folks call polarizing. Either you think it’s retro-cool with a side of awesome-sauce or a hearse made out of a couple of shoe boxes. All I can say is avoid the black-colored Flex. My test Flex was a super sparkly Dark Ink Blue Metallic with a white roof and 20-inch wheels, so I’ll call it retro-cool awesome-sauce.\n\nThe Flex reminds me of cool woodies from the ’60s, but without all the kitsch. In the front, it looks wide and low, with broad shoulders narrowing at the roof. The bold chrome grille sits in line with squared-off headlights, which gives it a serious tone. The large wheels also mean business and manage to make the Flex look smaller than it is. A narrow chrome strip and sculpting along the sides give it a sense of movement, while the two-tone exterior keeps things fresh. In the rear, an aluminum panel continues the horizontal movement while providing some texture.\n\nWhile the Flex sits a bit higher than a traditional sedan, it’s not as high off the ground as an SUV. This makes it really easy to get in and out of. I’m not a big fan of hauling myself up into a truck or up and out of a sports car. It’s the “hauling” part I don’t like, and there’s none of that with the Flex. The doors open wide enough to allow you to easily help little ones in the backseat, but not so wide that they’re out of reach for kids to close them by themselves. The ceiling is nice and high, which not only makes for lots of headroom, but plenty of rear visibility, as well.\n\nWith the third row up, there’s enough room in the cargo area for a weekly grocery run. When you fold down the third row, you get a flat floor in the cargo area. It’s so roomy that I was able to stand my son’s bike with training wheels back there. Have I mentioned that I really like this car?\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nRemember when domestic cars’ interiors were all cheesy and plasticky? The Ford Flex makes those days a distant memory, with rich cloth upholstery or soft leather seats, faux wood trim and clean instrumentation. The horizontal movement of the exterior is carried into the interior with strategic placement of the trim. In my test car, the wood trim began on my right, on the outer corner of the dash, then moved across the top of the steering wheel before continuing across the rest of the dashboard.\n\nThe leather seats are wide and comfy, with a faux-quilted look that gives them visual texture where things might have been plain. The instrument cluster is easy to read with blue-on-black dials and a small information screen. The center stack is wrapped in metallic-looking plastic trim, with a large, color touch-screen housing Ford’s amazing Sync system that does everything from navigation to reading your text messages. A small analog clock at the bottom of the center stack is a nice focal point. Little touches like that make the Flex funky and cool on the inside. Another is the ambient lighting that changes color with the push of a button. I usually chose purple to suit my regal nature.\n\nUsing the Sync system is absurdly easy. Push a button and a menu appears on the screen, so there is no fumbling around for the right commands. As you choose an option, the next set of commands appears. Need help? Say, “Help.” Want to hear a particular song? “Audio. iPod. Play song ‘Don’t Stop Believing.’ ” The Bluetooth connection is just as easy. Not only was my phone seamlessly integrated into the system, but the Flex played music off my iPhone via Bluetooth. This may be my favorite new-car feature. No cords, no indexing, no cumbersome menus, just my music playing automatically whenever I get into the car.\n\nLife is pretty good in the backseat, too. I had the seven-passenger model, which means the second row is a wide bench seat. It’s super comfy and my kids adored it. My 6-year-old was especially thrilled with it. The seat belt fit him so well that I let him ride without his booster seat like a big kid (in California kids 6 and older can ride in the backseat using only a seat belt). However, my kids did get frustrated with the flobby seat belt receptors that make it difficult to buckle up on their own. The kids also loved the great views they had out of their windows and the four moonroofs. In the second row, they each had their own moonroof above their seat, with accompanying shade. A larger one sits over the third row.\n\nA floor console houses the rear climate controls and two power sources, one of which is a regular 110-volt outlet. There’s also a pull-out compartment with storage and two cupholders. My kids could reach them, but smaller kids in child-safety seats won’t be able to. The six-passenger Flex has a large center console in the second row with more storage, cupholders as well as the much-ballyhooed optional refrigerated console ($795).\n\nThe second-row seats fold and tumble easily with one hand, making access to the third row pretty painless. The third row is surprisingly comfortable, and the passenger-side seat has a set of Latch connectors. The moonroof and large windows mean that even in the “way back” there’s no feeling of claustrophobia. There’s enough legroom in the third row that medium-sized adults will be comfortable. It’s not luxuriously roomy, but it’s more functional than many large SUVs on the road.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Ford Flex gets great safety marks, which is not at all surprising when you take a look at the long list of standard safety features. It comes with stability control with antiroll control, antilock brakes with brake assist, and traction control. The Flex also has side curtain airbags for all three rows, in addition to the front- and side-impact airbags for the front row. On the top-of-the-line Flex Limited, a backup camera comes standard.\n\nThe Flex also comes standard with MyKey, a feature that should thrill parents with teen drivers. It allows owners to limit the Flex’s top speed, add more seat belt warnings and limit the car stereo’s volume for drivers using a specific, programmable key.\n\nThere’s plenty of room in the second row to accommodate rear-facing child-safety seats. The second-row bench is wide enough to fit three child-safety seats. In the second and third rows, the Latch connectors are hidden by the seats. However, they aren’t hard to access.\n\nThe 2009 Flex was named a 2009 Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Despite the 2010 Flex’s ratings of Good – the highest score – in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by IIHS, the Flex hasn’t been named a 2010 Top Safety Pick. For 2010, vehicles must undergo a new roof-strength crash test; the Flex has yet to be tested.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: A smooth, quiet ride and plenty of cargo space help ease life with a baby.\n\nIn School: Easy access to all rows makes this great for carpooling.\n\nTeens: The programmable MyKey helps teen drivers stay safe on the road.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2011 about the 2011 Ford Flex. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nTo me, the Ford Flex is still the sharpest-looking minivan alternative on the market, but its boxy, ground-hugging appearance isn’t for everyone — and the low roofline sacrifices utility.\n\nNew this year is a top-of-the-line Titanium version that adds some interesting visual cues without changing the three-row Flex’s basic formula. It’s visually closer to a Land Rover Range Rover luxury SUV (which costs nearly three times as much as a base Flex) than it is to the SE, SEL and Limited trim levels below it. All-wheel drive is optional on all but the SE, as is Ford’s turbocharged EcoBoost V-6, which you can read about in my review of the 2010 EcoBoost Flex. You can also compare the 2010 and 2011 Flex here. We tested a front-wheel-drive Flex Titanium with a standard 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nTitanium Cues\nSince it arrived in late 2009, the Flex held an incidental resemblance to the Range Rover. With unique 20-inch wheels and a darkened, emblem-free grille with “FLEX” mounted in all caps above it — similar to Land Rover’s grille-top lettering — any notion of accidental resemblance will disappear. Applaud the effort or scoff it, this is the Flex doing its best Rover impression.\n\nChanges inside include Alcantara seat inserts and new faux-metal dashboard trim. Still, no one will mistake the Flex Titanium’s interior for a luxury SUV. The materials are excellent in some areas and conspicuously low-rent in others; it’s not the most consistent job. Major controls are easy to operate — and far simpler to use than Ford’s button-free MyFord Touch panels, which will probably make their way into the Flex not too far down the road. Get one now before it’s too late.\n\nInterior Space\nThe Flex’s modest height — at 68 inches, it’s shorter than a Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Chevy Traverse or Dodge Durango — might suggest less headroom or seating that’s too low to the ground. But the Ford exhibits neither: the second row has both decent seat height and good headroom, and both the first and second rows are easy to get into. With either a three-position bench seat or two captain’s chairs, there’s legroom to spare in the second row. For a three-row crossover, the Flex’s third row is habitable enough for short trips. Accessing it requires tumbling the second-row seats forward. It’s not as easy as some competitors’ sliding seats, but the space it leaves to climb in back is big enough.\n\nUnfortunately, the Flex’s height does hurt cargo room. Behind the rear seats is an impressive 20 cubic feet of cargo volume, but you may not be able to stand a lot of things upright: The cargo area’s height is just 31 inches. I had to dismantle my stand-up grille to get it and other tailgating accoutrements inside. It’s little wonder the Flex’s maximum cargo volume is just 83.2 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded. That’s in the same neighborhood as the Durango and Pilot, but it trails the Highlander’s 95.4 cubic feet and the Traverse’s 116.4 cubic feet. (Incidentally, this underscores how spacious a minivan is. Most of those have more than 140 cubic feet of maximum volume. If cargo space is your priority, crossovers are no match.)\n\nOn the Road\nEven with four adults and a cargo area full of gear, Ford’s 3.5-liter Duratec V-6 pulled our test car up to highway speeds swiftly enough. Although the Flex’s six-speed automatic can upshift a bit harshly around town, it kicks down quickly on the highway. The car accelerates smoothly from 60 to 70 mph in 4th gear, and the automatic wastes little time getting there.\n\nShould you want more oomph, the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 makes a robust 355 horsepower, versus the normally aspirated V-6’s 262 hp. With standard all-wheel drive, the EcoBoost Flex feels like it has a V-8 — and a strong one at that. One caveat: Ford recommends premium gas for maximum performance, versus regular for the 262-hp Flex. The EcoBoost V-6 can run on regular, but doing so means a slight loss in performance. Both all-wheel-drive variants get the same 18 mpg in combined EPA ratings. The front-drive Flex gets 19 mpg. Those figures are competitive for a three-row crossover, though the Flex’s 4,500-pound maximum towing capacity remains at the low end of the segment.\n\nThe suspension settles in fine on the highway, but the Titanium’s P255/45R20 tires will cost you ride comfort over major bumps. Potholes and manhole covers are rather jarring; lesser Flex trims, with their higher-profile tires, smooth those out. Automotive bling comes at a cost. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThe steering tracks well enough on the highway, but the Flex’s boxy shape makes it a victim to crosswinds. Hit the interstate on a gusty day, and the steering wheel will need constant attention if you want to stay on course. At lower speeds, many drivers will want more power assist. For a large crossover, the Flex requires too much effort to wheel around a parking lot, and its awful turning circle doesn’t help: At 40.7 feet, the Flex eclipses even the larger Traverse. The Durango, Pilot and Highlander all come in under 39 feet.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal takes some getting used to, exhibiting a truck-like mushiness in the first inch or so of travel. Farther down, the response is more linear.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Flex earned the top score, Good, across the board, making it an IIHS Top Safety Pick. The Flex has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using its new testing standards. Standard safety features include three-row curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nReliability has been average, though the EcoBoost Flex has fared better than other variants. The Flex SE starts at a hefty $29,220 — close to the Traverse but more than $1,000 more expensive than the Highlander and Pilot — but comes standard with front and rear air conditioning, 17-inch alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat and steering-wheel audio controls. Many of those features are optional on the other three. Options on the Flex include the usual luxury upgrades — heated leather seats, a navigation system and the like — as well as Ford’s iPod/USB-compatible Sync system, a self-parking system and a moonroof with three additional rear skylights.\n\nAll-wheel drive is an $1,850 option on the SEL, Limited and Titanium. It’s required for the EcoBoost V-6, which tacks on another $2,995. Load up an all-wheel-drive EcoBoost Titanium, and the tab can top $53,000.\n\nFlex in the Market\nDespite rising gas prices, three-row crossovers are steaming along. As of this writing, the Traverse, Highlander and Pilot — the segment’s three leading sellers — have all seen steady sales improvements this year. The Flex, for all its distinctive styling, hasn’t been lifted by the same tide: Sales are in a free fall.\n\nWhy? It seems shoppers haven’t warmed to the styling — especially since Ford’s more conventional-looking Explorer was redesigned to a crossover platform this year. Although it’s a bit smaller on the inside, the new Explorer has three rows of seats standard and outsells its boxy sibling by a ratio of 6.5-to-1. It seems Ford shoppers are flocking toward the venerable SUV nameplate and paying little heed to the nearby Flex; a Titanium edition will do little to change that.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "When I said, “I do” to my Japanese husband, I also said, “I do” to a life full of Hondas, Toyotas and maybe the occasional Subaru. Ford was off the list, which didn’t bother me until the introduction of the Ford Flex for the 2009 model year. Over the years, the three-row crossover made its presence known in my neighborhood and my heart. After a weeklong test drive, there’s nothing I don’t like about the 2011 Flex.\n\nWith a love-it-or-hate-it boxy exterior, the 2011 Ford Flex is the anti-minivan that drives as smoothly as a sedan and easily handles seven passengers.\n\nMy test car, the top-of-the-line Titanium trim, came equipped with Ford’s EcoBoost V-6 engine that delivers the power of a V-8 with a V-6’s fuel economy. The optional engine had plenty of power to merge onto the highway, and unless I was turning at high speeds, the Flex never felt like a big boat on the road. The Flex’s suspension absorbed road imperfections, proving its crossover chops.\n\nThe 2011 Flex has a starting MRSP of $29,355, but the Flex Titanium I test-drove cost a whopping $48,500.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Flex’s exterior is a polarizing topic. People either love or hate its square, wagon-like shape. While test-driving this crossover, I received nothing but positive comments and questions about it.\n\nThe boxy crossover had a convenient step-in height for my 3-year-old, and the slightly raised seats and ample ceiling height made it a breeze to install child-safety seats.\n\nWhen loading the Flex with kids and then all their gear, the power liftgate made it a little easier. It comes standard on the Titanium and Limited trims. The cargo area shines when the third row is folded down, but it shrinks significantly when the third row is in use. With the third-row seats up, I was able to fit a few bags of groceries, a case of diapers and my umbrella stroller in the deep storage well in the cargo area.\n\nOne pricey option — $1,495 to be exact — had my kids mesmerized. The Vista Roof, a panoramic moonroof with four glass panels, covered all three rows of seats.\n\nThe 2011 Flex Titanium came equipped with a 335-hp, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/21 mpg city/highway and uses premium fuel. A less powerful V-6 engine is on lower trim levels.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nFord had a family’s needs in mind when designing the Flex. The crossover is filled with nooks, crannies, power outlets and cupholders. You know, all the things parents can’t get enough of when hauling around children.\n\nAnother thing I can’t seem to get enough of is legroom. Child-safety seats normally swallow it up. However, the Flex comfortably accommodated my 6-foot-2 husband in the front passenger seat and a rear-facing convertible car seat in the second row behind him. It was truly an amazing feat. The third row was comfortable and had a workable amount of legroom.\n\nThe Flex can be had with two captain’s chairs in the second row, creating a pathway to the third row, or a three-seat bench. My test car had the standard three-seat bench, creating room for seven.\n\nTo access the third row, the second-row seats tumble forward. Unfortunately, with two car seats securely attached in the second row’s outboard seats, accessing the third row was difficult at best. Luckily, my 10-year-old sister was limber enough to climb over the car seats and basically fall into the third row. I couldn’t imagine having anyone older than 10 or without a sense of humor use the third row with my car seats blocking access to it.\n\nWhile my car seats thwarted most of the Flex’s seating configurations, they’re still worth mentioning. Excluding the driver’s seat, each of the Flex’s seats can fold flat, leaving a multitude of options when hauling munchkin-filled car seats.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Flex has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this, a car must earn the top scores of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests as well as have an electronic stability system.\n\nThe Flex Titanium also has traction control, anti-roll control, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. Ford’s MyKey is also standard. This feature allows the owners to limit the Flex’s top speed, increase seat belt warnings and limit the stereo’s volume when the specific key is used. All-wheel drive is standard on the Flex Titanium, but it’s optional on the lower trims.\n\nActive Park Assist is an optional feature that costs $550. When activated, it not only perfectly parallel parks the car, but it also finds the spot!\n\nIn the Flex’s three rows of seats come three sets of lower Latch anchors. There are two sets in the outboard seats in the second row and one set in the third row. While it’s convenient to have Latch anchors in the third row, I was only able to fit a booster seat back there. There wasn’t enough room for my forward-facing convertible. Four out of the five rear seat belts had stable buckles, making it easy for the older children to buckle themselves up.\n\nThe second row was spacious and could easily fit two child-safety seats. I was able to fit a passenger between the car seats, but squeezing three car seats into the second row was a no-go for us.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Ford Flex here.",
