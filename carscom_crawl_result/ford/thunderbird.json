      "expert_review": "Difficult to imagine that this portly coupe owes its heritage to the slim and trim ’55 Thunderbird, which, over the years, grew by leaps and pounds.\n\nIf you stick around long enough, you get to be called an icon and the liverspots become a symbol of survival. The ’96 Thunderbird is an icon.\n\nThough carrying a proud name, the rear-wheel-drive car for years has been burdened by having to justify its existence in a front-wheel-drive world–especially in the Snow Belt.\n\nWith traction control ($95), ABS ($570) and dual air bags (standard), there’s little reason to fear treading on the highway when the seasons change,but getting that message across to the public is no easy task. Ford, however, has spent no time or effort trying to educate consumers.\n\nIn the fall of ’98, Thunderbird will visit the fountain of youth and borrowthe Taurus front-wheel-drive platform. In the process the ‘Bird will shed somesize and weight and be limber and nimble enough to provide the ride, handling and performance of the younger Pontiac Grand Prix.\n\nIt also means that those who rely on a T-bird to tow will have to move up to the rear-drive Ford Crown Victoria, though it, too, is earmarked for the Taurus platform in 1999.\n\nThe T-bird’s attraction now is the 4.6-liter, 190-h.p., V-8, which allows you to move from the line with little hesitation and tow a small boat or camper. The 17-mile-per-gallon city/25-m.p.g. highway fuel economy rating is decent.\n\nOne drawback: you feel compartmentalized in the front seat by an instrumentpanel that protrudes well into the cabin.\n\nBase price of the Thunderbird LX we tested is $17,485, a sticker held down by making traction-assist and ABS options so as not to force the factory to bump up the cost by $665 but rather put the blame for a higher sticker on thecustomer.\n\nThe list of options ($4,045 worth) took up more space on the window stickerthan the standard equipment. Consumers probably can expect to see more of thisploy by all automakers to keep base prices down and put the onus of higher prices on the consumer for choosing of options.",

      "expert_review": "Thunderbird is marking its 40th year in the market, a considerable length of time for a rear-wheel-drive, two-door coupe in a world of front-wheel-drive, four-door sedans.\n\nThat will change in 1998, when the Thunderbird is built off a front-wheel-drive Taurus platform. But that is then, this is now, and let’s enjoy the car as it is while we can.\n\nWhoever said you can’t teach an old dog new tricks didn’t have the wherewithal of Ford engineers in mind. With anti-lock brakes and traction control, who cares if the ‘Bird is pulled from the front or pushed from the rear.\n\nWith traction control and 16-inch performance tires (an all season performance 16-inch tread is optional for only a few bucks more), you grab thepavement and keep going and just in case you get a bit too aggressive or if the unexpected should arise, the anti-lock brakes bring you to a sure stop.\n\nWith the Japanese-built 3.8-liter, 230-h.p., supercharged V-6 you’ll have ample opportunity to put the traction control and 16-inch tires to good use. Quick, quiet engine, but you have to suspect a Ford-built 32-valve V-8, the preferred engine choice, eventually will find its way into the car once it shares the Taurus platform.\n\nVery nice car. Above average performance yet respectable 18 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway mileage with 4-speed automatic; good interior room with comfortable seats that hold you in place; split fold down rear seats to increase cargo room and allow you to haul the skis inside; and dual airbags.\n\nYou’d think the Thunderbird Super Coupe would be hotter than it is. Some dealers say the car collects more dust than its less powerful but far less expensive Thunderbird LX running mate.\n\nTo promote Thunderbird sales when its Big Three rivals were bringing out midsize front-drive models, Ford sharply reduced the price of the LX a few years ago, but not the Super Coupe. While the base engine in the LX is only a 3.8-liter, 140-h.p., V-6, the optional engine is a 4.6-liter, 205-h.p., V-8. So a consumer could settle for a V-8 with 25 h.p. less than the supercharged V-6 and get a Thunderbird for about $5,000 to $6,000 less than the Super Coupe.\n\nOur test car started at $22,735. A preferred equipment group with speed control, power locks and the supercharger ran $960; automatic transmission ran$790; keyless entry, a very stiff $215; luxury light group with illuminated visor mirrors, illuminated entry system and power antenna, $325; front floor mats, $30; power seats, $290; AM/FM stereo with compact disc player, $430; andleather seats, $615.

      "expert_review": "The Ford Thunderbird for 1993 is limited to LX and Super Coupe models. For ’93, the LX sports an exterior look similar to that of the sporty Super Coupe.The LX is marketed as a single-price entry at about $16,000.\n\nA 3.8-liter, 140-horsepower V-6 is standard in the LX. A 5-liter, 200-h.p.,high-output V-8 with four-speed automatic transmission is optional at $1,086 for the engine/transmission package.\n\nThe car we tested came with the V-8, a powerful yet quiet unit, though at times it stumbled and wasn’t as smooth as we’d expect in a V-8, especially onethat sets the buyer back an extra $1,086.\n\nAs is often the case with Fords, you feel some heaviness in the wheel, but the suspension is nimble enough so that you don’t fight the weight in corners or turns or when trying to slink into that narrow parking spot.\n\nA driver-side air bag is standard, but anti-lock brakes are a $695 option.\n\nThe interior is attractive, but though the front seat is roomy, the rear seat comes up short in headroom unless you like to slouch. The trunk is not deep.\n\nNice touches include automatic safety belts, an arrow in the instrument panel pointing out which side the fuel-filler door is on and a panic button onthe key fob. If you approach the car in a parking lot and spot someone tampering with the vehicle or a suspicious-looking character lurking nearby, you can press the panic button to set off the horn and flashing lights.\n\nThe base price is $15,797. By “single price,” Ford means the LX offers at no extra charge a $738 option package consisting of automatic temperature control; rear-window defroster; dual, illuminated visor mirrors; power antenna; and cast aluminum wheels. Standard are such items as illuminated entry, power locks, power driver seat, speed control, tilt steering wheel and automatic transmission. With options made standard plus factory and dealer margin reductions, the LX price is down about $4,000 from ’92.\n\nStill, the sky is the limit on the sticker, depending on what other goodiesyou add. A power moonroof runs $776, power seats $305, leather seats $515 and a compact-disc player $491. Our test car topped $22,000 with those goodies anda slew more.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord created a flurry of excitement when the revived Thunderbird appeared as a 2002 model. Though it is fully modern underneath, the redesigned model was a throwback to the original two-passenger T-Bird of 1955 – 1957.\n\nThe wheels have been restyled and a universal garage-door opener is now standard for the 2004 model year. The front fenders hold new V-8 badges, and newly styled seats have leather seating surfaces.\n\nAdapted from the Lincoln LS platform, the rear-wheel-drive Thunderbird has a 3.9-liter V-8 engine — which received a boost from 252 to 280 horsepower for 2003 — and a five-speed-automatic transmission. The convertible comes in Deluxe and Premium trim levels. A removable plastic hardtop is optional, and the car’s hood, fenders and rear deck are also made of plastic.\n\nEven though Ford shuns the retro label, designers gazed backward to a dramatic era of the company’s heritage to revive the Thunderbird. Like its long-ago predecessor, the 2004 Thunderbird seats two occupants and is equipped with rear-wheel drive, but it incorporates all the benefits of modern technology.\n\nExterior\nStyling kinship to the original Thunderbird is obvious in its eggcrate-style grille and round headlamps, while the hood scoop suggests a 1961 model. It’s also evident in the classic porthole-style quarter windows that are incorporated into the optional removable hardtop. The basic reverse-wedge profile and taillight shapes also hark back to the past.\n\nThe current Thunderbird measures 186.3 inches long overall and has a 107.2-inch wheelbase, versus a 175.3-inch overall length and a 102.0-inch wheelbase in the original. Six colors are available for 2004: Merlot, Vintage Mint Green, Platinum Silver, Torch Red, Light Ice Blue Metallic and Evening Black. A fabric convertible top is standard. Cast-aluminum 16-spoke wheels hold 17-inch all-season tires.\n\nInterior\nAccording to Ford, the two-seat cockpit “reflects the exterior design and the car’s romantic heritage with bold style combined with the comfort and convenience [features that] today’s customers demand.” The interior trim complements the body color. Standard features include automatic dual-zone air conditioning, leather bucket seats, a tachometer, a six-way power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped power tilt steering wheel and an in-dash six-CD changer. Trunk capacity is 8.5 cubic feet. Heated seats are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAn aluminum, 3.9-liter, dual-overhead-cam V-8 engine produces 280 hp at 6,000 rpm and drives a close-ratio five-speed-automatic transmission. SelectShift operation for manually selected gear changes is optional.\n\nSafety\nThe Thunderbird was Ford’s first convertible with head and chest side-impact airbags. Four-wheel all-disc antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven though the Thunderbird’s ride quality isn’t bad on smooth highways and handling is agile enough, its suspension is on the stiff side and can take some bumps rather hard. Featuring brisk passing and merging capabilities, acceleration from a standstill is outstanding.\n\nSlipping inside the T-Bird may demand a significant twist of the neck in order to clear the soft top, but the seats are cushioned beautifully. The mirrors are ample in size, but serious blind spots make lane changing dicey.\n\nEven though it’s more ordinary than the flamboyant shape suggests, this two-seater delivers a generally enjoyable experience — a flashback to the Fifties. Sadly, it doesn’t feel especially well assembled.",

      "expert_review": "Ford Thunderbird still gets plenty of attention. People stop and stare, ogling its retro form with unabashed appreciation, looking it over stem to stern as it glides past in traffic.\n\nThe bright-red, 2003 T-Bird test car also garnered many unsolicited compliments.\n\nStill, during my time with the Thunderbird last month, Ford announced it would cease production of its stylish roadster after the 2005 or ’06 model year. The end is coming because Thunderbird has a critical problem: Despite the apparent adoration, not enough people are buying them.\n\nThunderbird made a huge splash when it was unveiled in 2001, complete with waiting lists and markups. But it was soon labeled a boulevard cruiser, with a soft ride and modest performance, rather than a sports car. Of course, it was never meant to be a sporting machine. But in this world of comparably priced Chevrolet Corvettes, Audi TTs, Honda S2000s, BMW Z3s and other two-seater sports cars, Thunderbird became an anomaly.\n\nLast year, Thunderbird fell nearly 6,000 short of expected 25,000 in sales, with some languishing on dealers’ lots.\n\nThis is the second time Ford has killed off the Thunderbird name. In the late ’90s, the company discontinued the then-bloated four-seater with the promise that Thunderbird would rise again to resemble the memorable 1955-57 T-Birds, which remain favorites among collectors.\n\nThat promise was kept. And because the current Thunderbirds will endure such a limited run, they also may become hot collectors’ items. Though probably in the distant future.\n\nWhat it is:\n\nFord’s effort to relive past glory spawned this attractive image car, an enjoyable cruiser for two. Thunderbird is the perfect craft for a top-down sunset drive with a favorite passenger, though it falls short on sporty performance.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nThe smooth 3.9-liter V-8, the same engine used in Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type (which also share the same chassis), has been upped to 280 horsepower from 252, and the difference is immediately noticeable. Despite substantial heft, the T-Bird moves out nicely from a stop and cruises quietly at freeway speeds. Acceleration is strong but not in the same territory as a V-8 performance car, such as Corvette or Mustang GT.\n\nA five-speed automatic is the only transmission available, underscoring T-Bird’s mission as a cruiser.\n\nHandling and drivability:\n\nThough the mushy suspension blunts its sportiness, Thunderbird is well-balanced and corners with minimal body sway. In some ways, this car drives as retro as it looks, feeling like a vintage American convertible. Once I got used to it, I found it to be enjoyable and even fun, as long as I didn’t push too hard.\n\nStyling:\n\nThe retro look has held up well, still attractive and distinctive. Bringing back a blast from the past can be problematic. Check out the fast fade of the Chrysler PT Cr uiser and the Volkswagen New Beetle, both of which went from overheated desirability to normal transportation in just a couple of years. Stay tuned for the future success of the Mini Cooper, which is still riding high for such a little car. Thunderbird is a more expensive, limited-edition example of retro-mobile, so its story is a bit different.\n\nThe test car came with the removable hardtop, complete with a porthole in the rear pillar like the ’57 T-Bird. The top now comes standard. Removal and installation takes two people.\n\nInterior:\n\nThe red-and-white interior is roomy and pleasant looking, though the center console is too bland.\n\nIt looks like it came straight from the Ford parts bin instead of being designed specially for this special car.\n\nPricing:\n\nJust over $40,000 gives you a limited-edition car that will at least get you noticed and possibly envied. It comes fully loaded with features, including 17-inch chrome wheels. ptions were an interior package with a color-coordinated steering wheel, shift knob and other pieces, $595; a Select Shift transmission that allows manual gear changes, $130; and shipping, $605.\n\nBottom line:\n\nHandsome and fun but lacking some of the sporty characteristics of the competition, Ford Thunderbird is going away – again.\n\nFord Thunderbird\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $40,260.\n\nPrice as tested: $41,590.\n\nEngine: 3.9-liter V-8, 280 horsepower at 6,000 rpm, 286 pound-feet torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 107.2 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,775 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 24 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nHandsome styling.\n\nMore engine power.\n\nRoomy interior.\n\nLows:\n\nToo-soft suspension.\n\nInterior glitches.\n\nThe end is near.",

      "expert_review": "For decades, Detroit’s automobiles used design to evoke an aura, a glamor that would entice buyers into the showrooms. Sure, one needed the functionality of a car, but its function came secondary to form.\n\nToo many cars these days fulfill their mission in life with a bland utilitarianism – fuel efficient, dependable, comfortable, convenient, perfect.\n\nNotice the word emotion in there? You won’t.\n\nCars are designed for function first. These days, a car’s glamour is in its perfection, not its stylish allure.\n\nBut with all cars reaching the same state of reliability, how does an automaker make its product stand out?\n\nStyle. Heaps of it.\n\nWith cars such as the PT Cruiser and VW Beetle, car makers are rediscovering their styling heritage.\n\nEnter the 2002 Ford Thunderbird. Its simple, elegant shape recalls the original 1955 Thunderbird without duplicating it. The design captures the car’s essence eloquently.\n\nIt certainly captures the hearts of onlookers with its gentle curves, 17-inch wheels and perfect stance. It prompted doubletakes wherever it went. The car was especially captivating to women.\n\nThe same loving reaction never happened while I was driving the Lincoln LS, the sober, sensible sports sedan that donated most of the Thunderbird’s genetic material. But, the Thunderbird shares the most important aspect of the Lincoln’s genetic make-up: it’s a hoot to drive.\n\nThis bird flies off the line. The 3.9-liter, double-overhead-cam V-8 sports 252 horsepower and strong acceleration. A five-speed automatic is the only transmission available. While it’s smooth most of the time, there is some hesitation before downshifting for more power. That’s typical of Ford transmissions.\n\nThe exhaust note is perfect, a blend of low-end rumble and high-pitched power.\n\nSuspension is independent at all four corners. The ride is firm enough, but not sports car jarring. There’s a nice balance between ride and handling. Thrust this rear-drive ‘Bird into a corner and its balance is tremendous. Enthusiasts will appreciate that applying the brakes or throttle at the right moment will make the back end twitch when desired. It’s really fun and helped overcome some gripes I had with the car.\n\nThere’s good bump absorption, although some softness is dialed into the ride. Although some may criticize this, it’s certainly in character with the car’s boulevardier demeanor.\n\nThe bigger problem is that despite additional bracing to the platform, there is too much cowl shake over bumps. This should improve if you order the optional hardtop.\n\nOn the plus side, the car’s convertible top didn’t leak, even in massive downpours. The top is fully lined, has a glass rear window with integral defogger and offers an incredibly quiet environment when it’s in place.\n\nThe bland interior is a little disappointing compared to the car’s stylish exterior. Most of this is because Ford used the Lincoln LS dashboard with very little alteration. While it is appropriate in the Lincoln, it fails to excite here. Ford does add unique gauges with teal pointers on the speedometer and tachometer. Also included are some body-colored materials and a strip of brushed-aluminum trim, which help offset the hard plastics that line the cabin.\n\nOne major problem cropped up: Ford has announced a recall of 16,500 Thunderbirds for a seatbelt that can be cut in a front-end crash. Two minor fit and finish problems were: a boot cover over the handbrake was loose, as was a door-mounted radio speaker grille.\n\nThe leather-covered bucket seats seemed firm, but supremely comfortable for long trips. Strangely, the car lacks seat heaters. This is the perfect indulgence when driving with the top down in chilly weather.\n\nThe interior doesn’t have a lot of storage space, but map pockets, a glove box and mini console prove sufficient. The car lacks an ashtray.\n\nThe convertible top goes down quickly. Unhook the center latch, hold a button and it’s down in seconds. But you’ll have to put down the windows separately. Unlike some convertibles, the windows stay up when the top goes down. It would be nice if Ford equipped both power windows with express down, something only reserved for the driver’s side.\n\nWhile this is one of the most enjoyable rides I’ve had in a long time, quality issues continue to plague Ford. It blemishes an otherwise fine set of wheels.",
