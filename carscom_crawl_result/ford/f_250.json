      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that’s engineered to tackle the most extreme towing and hauling challenges. The lineup consists of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks. Buyers can choose from two gasoline engines — a 405-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 and a 430-hp, 7.3-liter V-8 — or a turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel that makes 475 hp in its standard form or 500 hp in high-output form. Every engine is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and a 10-speed automatic is standard across the lineup. The Super Duty’s primary rivals are the Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ram Heavy Duty.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty lineup was redesigned for the 2023 model year and sees a number of available trim and technology updates for 2025, along with a shuffling of standard and optional equipment. A ritzy Platinum Plus Package includes a unique satin-finish grille with bright chrome accents, a Smoked Truffle interior featuring perforated Venetian leather seats with French stitching, and a 2-kilowatt onboard power source for tools and toys. Available towing tech now includes an auxiliary trailer camera, a tire pressure monitoring system for trailers and blind spot monitors that cover the length of whatever you’re towing.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 13,800 to 40,000 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Super Duty’s curb weight ranges from 5,697 to 8,627 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nThree-seat regular cab\n8-inch touchscreen\nFour-speaker audio system\n40/20/40-split, folding vinyl bench seat\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\nWi-Fi hot spot\n17-inch steel wheels\nTrailer-tow side mirrors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-inch digital instrument display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-wheel rear axle\nTremor Off-Road Package\nLeather seating\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty is one of the toughest, most capable trucks available, period. It can be a no-nonsense work vehicle when equipped with a minimum of frills, or it can be a veritable luxury-lined cruiser that also happens to be capable of towing and hauling pretty much anything thrown its way. Speaking of towing and hauling, the Super Duty is available with an unmatched array of smart technology features — including Pro Trailer Hitch Assist and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System — meant to make those tasks much easier.\n\nThere’s no doubt the F-250, F-350 and F-450 are hugely versatile, but they may also be way too much truck for many people. Key rivals, specifically the Ram Heavy Duty, receive more opulent interior trim when scaling up to range-topping variants. The Super Duty’s ride can also get jittery when equipped with off-road hardware, such as the optional Tremor Off-Road Package. Still, when it comes to getting a job done, the Ford Super Duty is among the very best in the business.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Styling and interior changes are subtle, but the 2023 Ford Super Duty heavy-duty pickup truck continues to push the cutting edge of technology with some stunning new towing systems.\n\nVersus the competition: “Max towing” or “most powerful” numbers don’t mean anything (they change almost monthly), but where the Ford stands out from its competitors is in the remarkable, genuinely useful technology it brings to help owners use their trucks more efficiently and safely.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of the Super Duty lineup of pickup trucks to Ford Motor Co.’s bottom line. They’re massively profitable and extremely popular vehicles, and you can bet it’s their continued influx of profit that’s funding a lot of the company’s shift toward electrified vehicles. But that electrification is skipping the big heavy-duty truck class for now largely because the technology just isn’t ready yet. Instead, gas and diesel engines still rule the land because those are what work for these trucks, and these trucks are what work for people who use their trucks for professional purposes. The Super Duty (available in F-250, F-350 and F-450 versions) is first and foremost a workhorse — 90% of Super Duty owners tow with their trucks, according to Ford, so that’s one area the company has focused on for this update for the 2023 model year. Some new styling, two new engines, and a host of revisions and refinements help keep the Super Duty competitive against a new set of GM pickups also arriving for 2023. So what has Ford done to keep the Super Duty on top?\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Super Duty: Ford’s Workhorse Gets Some New Grunt and Updated Tech\n\nIs It a Ranger XXL, Or Is the New Ranger a Baby Super Duty?\n\nThe most obvious and perhaps least important aspect of the new ‘23 Super Duty is its updated looks — the family resemblance to the rest of the Ford truck showroom might not be obvious at first, but then have a look at the new 2024 Ranger mid-size pickup that’s just been unveiled and you’ll get it. It looks like a Ranger XXL — or maybe the Ranger is a baby Super Duty now? Either way, it’s a big, boxy truck with a big, boxy look. The sides and rear are slightly cleaner, as well, but it still pretty much looks like the outgoing truck, with the big C-channel-style LED running lights up front and a multitude of trim levels to choose from, each with their own grille and wheel styles. The Super Duty styling wasn’t broken, so nobody tried to fix anything — unlike the revisions to the latest GM trucks, which saw some pretty significant changes from the last update to the current one, as the styling of the last ones was rather controversial.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore Significant Changes Inside\n\nThe updates to the cabin are a bit more significant than the ones to the styling, but they are again evolutionary, as they should be. Cabin materials have taken another step up the niceness ladder but still fall short of the benchmark Ram HD cabins when you compare the top luxury trim levels. Ford needs to figure out how to make the cheap, smooth plastic on the dash, consoles and doors not feel like cheap, smooth plastic. The leather quality in trims like the Platinum and King Ranch (especially the latter) is excellent, the colors are on point and the new interior styling is top notch, too. Comfort is also excellent, with big, supportive seats and more cabin room for passengers than you could possibly ever need.\n\nThe controls adjustability is also superior to that of the GM trucks — the steering wheel and seats seem to have more adjustability, and visibility is notably better than the GM trucks. A lower hood, taller windshield and lower beltline make it feel like you have more glass than steel around you, making it easier to see out.\n\nThe big new displays inside are also excellent. Ford is sticking with its own proprietary Sync 4 multimedia system, not yet going to Google Built-In as some automakers have, and that’s a good thing. It simply works better than the Google-based systems I’ve tried in GM’s trucks; it also has better resolution and is easier to reconfigure. Most of the trucks I sampled during the introduction to the Super Duty at Ford’s Michigan Proving Grounds north of Detroit were Lariat-trimmed and above, so they featured the big new 12-inch touchscreen paired with a 12-inch digital instrument cluster that’s standard on all trims. It’s augmented by the new optional full-color head-up display that adds yet another futuristic dimension to the new truck. And thankfully, there are still plenty of hard buttons and knobs for more frequently used controls, so you’re not constantly trying to use touchscreen controls.\n\nA Bit More Grunt\n\nThere’s a choice of four engines in the Super Duty, including a new base engine: a standard 6.8-liter gasoline V-8 engine making 405 horsepower and 445 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard 10-speed automatic transmission that’s used with all of the engines. You can upgrade to a carryover 7.3-liter gas V-8 engine making 430 hp and 485 pounds-feet of torque, but if you’re like the majority of Super Duty owners, you’re going to opt for the diesel powerplant. The entry diesel is a turbocharged 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 with 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 pounds-feet of torque, but you can also upgrade to the new high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 that makes a lunatic 500 hp and 1,200 pounds-feet of torque. That’s just about enough torque to shift the orbit of the moon, but it’ll probably be upstaged next week when Ram or Chevy somehow find a bit more power out of their own diesel engines so that they’re the class leader for a while. Chasing the “most powerful” prize is a fool’s errand; at those high levels of torque, everything seems to operate the same anyway — incredibly capably.\n\nThat’s how the Super Duty works, at any rate. At Ford’s proving grounds, we were able to sample the new Super Duty performing all manner of workhorse tasks: I towed a 40,000-pound gooseneck trailer up and down a 7% grade with no problem whatsoever. I also towed a slightly lesser 30,000-pound trailer in a much more commonly available trim combination of the Super Duty, also with no problem or difficulty. Yeah, the big diesel is breathing hard, but that roar is actually the massive cooling system doing its job and keeping the big diesel mill nicely chilled. It will actually accelerate up that 7% grade with your foot to the floor while lugging the big trailer, that’s how much torque you have to play with. It’s practically overkill, but if it were me out in the real world lugging something that heavy, overkill with torque is exactly what I’d want. The thing is, who is actually towing a 40,000-pound trailer on a public road with a pickup? That, to me, seems like the kind of thing you do with a Class B truck, but you can certainly do it with a Super Duty, as well (provided you have a commercial driver’s license).\n\nRefinement Is Clear\n\nThe excellent part of driving this new Super Duty is not how it behaves with a huge load behind it; I expect it to be able to achieve amazing feats of strength when pushed to its limits, and it does that without drama. What’s more amazing is that it’s quiet, refined, comfortable and pleasant to drive without a load behind it, which is far more difficult to achieve. In order to have a truck that can perform feats of strength, heavy-duty equipment has to be present, and it often leads to a bouncy ride, a loud engine and steering that’s numb and odd to use. Not so in the new Super Duty; Ford engineers have crafted a truck that’s all-day pleasant to use even when not towing or hauling anything. It drives like a smaller, lighter truck. Both the diesel and, especially, the gas engines are quiet and refined at speed or when accelerating. The transmission isn’t clunky or harsh. The steering feels natural and isn’t overboosted. This might be the closest the Super Duty has ever come to feeling like the light-duty F-150 in recent memory.\n\nWhere it’s not as pleasant is off-road, where its sheer size and weight means it feels like riding an elephant through the woods. The Tremor off-road package first appeared on the Super Duty before proliferating throughout the Ford truck lineup, and it does indeed boost the capability of the Super Duty with a more off-road-ready suspension, 18-inch wheels with 35-inch tires, underbody protection and off-road tuning (including the addition of Trail Turn Assist, which you frankly need off-road given the Super Duty’s massive length). But it’s too big to be an enjoyable experience in the dirt. As a work truck to get you to a logging camp or a remote construction site, it’ll do, but it wouldn’t be my first choice for wheeling through the rough.\n\nWhere the Magic Happens\n\nThe real story of the ‘23 Super Duty isn’t in the powertrain, the numbers or the new cabin, it’s the new technology debuting on the truck that’s going to make it the envy of the industry. We were impressed when Ford first showed us Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a system that, once you’ve set it up, allows you to reverse your pickup and trailer combination using just the backup cameras and a knob on the dash. No trying to figure out if you turn the steering wheel left or right when reversing, what direction that’ll send the trailer. You just use the guidelines to point the trailer in the direction you want it to go, operate the pedals, and everything becomes so much easier.\n\nWell, now there’s something even more jaw-dropping: Using the backup camera and radar sensors in the Super Duty plus some extraordinary computing power, the truck will now automatically back itself up perfectly aligned to hook up a trailer. Line it up in front of the trailer in question, push a few buttons on the touchscreen to activate the newly available Pro Trailer Hitch Assist system, take your feet off the pedals and your hands off the steering wheel, and the truck will back itself up to align a conventional hitch ball with the trailer coupler. All you then need to do is lower the trailer onto the ball, and off you go. There are several step-by-step prompts from the onboard computer along the way, but it completely takes the guesswork and teamwork out of trying to hook up a trailer to your Super Duty. It is perhaps the ultimate marriage-saving device if YouTube videos of amateur boaters launching various crafts is anything to go by.\n\nThat’s not the only bit of brilliant tech to debut. You know how you lose the backup camera in a pickup truck when you have the tailgate down? Maybe you have the tailgate lowered to back up to a loading dock to have a bunch of stuff dropped into the bed? Well, Ford has solved that problem, too, with the new available Tailgate Down Camera and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System. They’ve put a second backup camera and radar sensors in the top of the tailgate, meant to activate when the tailgate’s been lowered, so you have full backup camera and sensor functionality. It’s one of those systems that leaves you wondering why nobody’s thought of this before.\n\nThere are a host of other new innovations for the Super Duty, as well, such as a navigation system that can incorporate the size and weight of the trailer you’re towing into directions, helping to avoid low bridges or super-tight corners that might be problematic. The blind spot warning system adds trailer coverage for fifth-wheel and gooseneck setups to detect vehicles alongside the trailer (additional equipment is required, however). There’s an electronic Onboard Scales with Smart Hitch system that automatically measures not only the weight of the payload in the bed, it also can detect if your trailer’s load is balanced properly based on the change in the tongue weight. It even lets you adjust the trailer load and get visual feedback in real-time using the LED taillights as guides. It’s a compilation of astonishingly useful, genuinely usable technology that will make owner-operator’s lives easier and safer.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Ford Super Duty Up Close: More Useful Tech Is Always Good\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD: New Face, New Interior, More Diesel Power, ZR2 on the Way\n2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Joins the Off-Road Party\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-250\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-350\nCome and Get It\n\nThe new Super Duty’s updates should make it even more desirable than the outgoing model, securing its position as the likely sales leader for the segment quite nicely. By offering more choices, more refinement and some game-changing technology, the new Super Duty becomes more useful than ever for a wide, wide range of customers.\n\nPrices vary depending on options and requirements, but suffice it to say that you can spec a Super Duty from the base F-250 XL regular-cab 4×2 with the 6.8-liter gas V-8 from $45,865 (all prices include a whopping $1,895 destination charge) all the way up to the F-450 Limited crew-cab 4×4 dually with the high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel for an eye-watering $110,000-plus with options — or anywhere in between, as your needs require and your wallet allows. The number of build combinations is astonishing, but so are the number of uses the Super Duty can fulfill. And with the new 2023 model’s advanced tech, more powerful engines and nicer cabin, it’ll continue to be a useful tool for the foreseeable future.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Ford F-Series Super Duty configurator is already a dizzying place, with F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks available with three cab sizes, two bed lengths, five trim levels, four engines, and single- and dual-rear-wheel configurations. For the 2026 model year, there are even more choices.\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Super Duty Review: Subtle Upgrades, More Jaw-Dropping Tech\n\nThose new choices come in the form of previously — or at least recently —unavailable combinations of existing elements. The SuperCab, with its rear-hinged rear doors and smaller backseat than the Crew Cab, can once again be paired with the short 6.75-foot bed. In recent years, the SuperCab was only available with the 8-foot box.\n\nPerhaps motivated by the Ram Rebel’s available Cummins diesel engine, Ford is now offering its 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8 on trucks equipped with the Tremor Off-Road Package. Similarly, the STX Appearance Package is now available on the F-350; it includes body-color bumpers, a painted grille, STX decals and interior upgrades.\n\nFord has also bundled a handful of popular options into the new Lariat Premium Package, which includes running boards, a power-sliding rear window, the Co-Pilot 360 2.0 safety-tech suite, and a trio of technologies aimed at simplifying the tasks of hooking up a trailer and maneuvering with one attached. Creating a new void of the sort addressed by this year’s additions to the ordering guide, the Lariat Premium Package is only available on trucks equipped with the optional 7.3-liter V-8 engine.\n\nRead More About the Ford Super Duty:\n\nLuxe Truck: 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Adds Fancy Features, Towing Tech\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nIs the 2023 Ford Super Duty a Good Pickup Truck? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\n2023 Ford Super Duty Up Close: More Useful Tech Is Always Good\nResearch the Ford F-250\nSome Things for Everyone\n\nFinally, tire pressure monitors are now standard across the Super Duty lineup. All buyers also now have the choice to sign up for seven years of the Ford Connectivity Package with a one-time purchase; the package includes cellular connectivity, a Wi-Fi hot spot, audio and video streaming, a voice assistant and connected navigation.\n\nShoppers can now order their 2026 Ford Super Duty at their local dealership. Pricing for the full lineup will be available soon.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe F-Series Super Duty is Ford’s line of heavy-duty pickup trucks, which are available in a variety of configurations and three model series: F-250, F-350 and F-450. The truck can carry as many as six people when properly configured, and competitors include 2500 and 3500 models in the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram truck lines.\n\nTwo engines are available: a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 and a 6.2-liter gas V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nNew for 2012\nA strengthened frame and trailer hitch provides 17,500 pounds of conventional towing capacity when properly equipped. Ford also offers a CNG/LPG prep package for gas-engine trucks, and a gooseneck hitch is available for the 6.75-foot cargo box.\n\nExterior\nA 2011 restyling brought a “power dome” hood and a bolder grille stamped with a Super Duty logo and an oversized Ford oval badge. Buyers have the choice of an extended cab (Super Cab) with a 6.75- or 8-foot box and a crew cab with four conventional doors and a 6.75- or 8-foot box. Dual-rear-wheel models are available with the 8-foot box. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard trailer hitch receiver\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- and 20-inch rims available\nOptional PowerScope towing mirrors\nOptional power moonroof\nOptional tubular side steps or running boards\nOptional  spray-in bedliner\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty borrows seats from the F-150, and offers a three-place front bench seat or front bucket seats. The bench seat is split 40/20/40, and a lockable under-seat center storage compartment is optional. A wide center console is available on models with front buckets and includes a bin large enough to hold a laptop computer. On the Lariat, heated and cooled front seats with a memory feature for the power driver’s seat are optional. Crew cab models have a three-place rear bench seat that flips up to reveal a flat cargo floor. An available 4.2-inch LCD screen in the instrument cluster shows fuel economy information and monitors off-road and towing details. Interior features include: \n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional navigation system with SiriusXM Travel Link\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Sync system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 is a single-overhead-camshaft engine that runs on regular gas or E85 ethanol. It produces 385 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe available Power Stroke 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 produces 400 hp and a massive 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm, making it the logical choice for serious towing and hauling. The Power Stroke V-8 burns regular diesel fuel or a blend of up to 20 percent biodiesel.\n\nBoth engines work with a standard six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates Ford’s SelectShift technology, which enables driver-initiated shifts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard electronic locking rear differential\n\nSafety\nSafety features on the Super Duty include:\n\n\nStandard stability system with Roll Stability Control\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard front-seat side-impact airbags\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nOptional rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe F-Series Super Duty is Ford’s line of heavy-duty pickup trucks, which are available in a variety of configurations and three model series: F-250, F-350 and F-450. The truck can carry as many as six people when properly configured, and competitors include 2500 and 3500 models in the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram truck lines.\n\nTwo engines are available: a 6.2-liter gas V-8 and a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission.\nNew for 2013\nFord debuts a Platinum edition of the Super Duty that comes standard with upscale features like a backup camera, navigation system, MyFord Touch, remote start, power-adjustable pedals, power-telescoping mirrors and 20-inch polished-aluminum wheels. The truck also gets a mesh grille surrounded by satin chrome trim as well as chrome tow hooks, door handles, mirror covers and exhaust tip. Inside, there’s a heated leather steering wheel, premium leather upholstery, woodgrain-style trim, two USB ports, A/V connection points and an SD card slot.\nExterior\nA 2011 restyling brought a “power dome” hood, a bolder grille stamped with a Super Duty logo and an oversized Ford oval badge. Buyers have the choice of an extended cab (Super Cab) with a 6.75- or 8-foot box and a crew cab with four conventional doors and a 6.75- or 8-foot box. Dual-rear-wheel models are available with the 8-foot box. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard trailer hitch receiver\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- and 20-inch wheels available\nOptional PowerScope towing mirrors \nOptional power moonroof\nOptional tubular side steps or running boards\nOptional spray-in bedliner\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty borrows seats from the Ford F-150 pickup truck, and it offers a three-place front bench seat or front bucket seats. The bench seat is split 40/20/40, and a lockable under-seat center storage compartment is optional. A wide center console is available on models with front buckets and includes a bin large enough to hold a laptop computer. On the Lariat, heated and cooled front seats with a memory feature for the power driver’s seat are optional. Crew cab models have a three-place rear bench seat that flips up to reveal a flat cargo floor. An available 4.2-inch LCD screen in the instrument cluster shows fuel-economy information and monitors off-road and towing details. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional navigation system with SiriusXM Travel Link\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Sync system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 is a single-overhead-camshaft engine that runs on regular gas or E85 ethanol. It produces 385 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe available Power Stroke 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 produces 400 hp and a massive 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm, making it the logical choice for serious towing and hauling. The Power Stroke V-8 burns regular diesel fuel or a blend of up to 20 percent biodiesel.\n\nBoth engines work with a standard six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates Ford’s SelectShift technology, which enables driver-initiated shifts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nGas V-8 can be fitted to run on CNG/LPG\n\nSafety\nSafety features on the Super Duty include:\n\n\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control\nSide curtain airbags\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nOptional rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty is one of the toughest and most versatile trucks on the market, but Ford has left its heavy-duty pickup truck virtually unchanged for 2010.\n\nThe Super Duty is available in regular cab, SuperCab and crew cab in either 4×2 or 4×4 drivetrain. The regular cab comes only with an 8-foot cargo bed, while the other two cabs can be ordered with either an 8-foot or 6.75-foot bed.\n\nThe F-350 SuperCab long bed and crew cab long bed can be ordered with dual rear wheels. The F-450 comes only in crew cab long bed with DRW.\n\nThe trim designations have been changed slightly for 2010: The FX4 off-road package is available for the XL, XLT and Lariat trims. The new Cabela’s trim incorporates the FX4 package and adds Cabela’s embroidery, decals and other features.\n\nA properly equipped F-250 can carry 3,200 pounds and tow more than 16,000 pounds. The F-350 goes up to 5,700 and 18,400 pounds, respectively. The F-450 can carry three tons of payload and has a maximum tow rating of 24,500 pounds (with a fifth wheel trailer hitch).\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Cabela’s special edition pickup is based on the off-road-inspired FX4 trim. Ford says more than 75 percent of F-Series owners hunt or fish, so the Cabela’s package is designed to appeal to those likely to shop at the outfitter. There are interior materials unique to the package and additional lockable storage for firearms.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson edition returns on the F-450 model. This Harley is easy to spot, with large blue flame decals coming from the side vents. The familiar cues of a black leather interior and metal badges maintain the theme.\n\nFinally, Ford is offering a spray-on factory bedliner.\n\nExterior\nThe Super Duty’s bulk is well-proportioned, even on short-bed models. Ford offers a wide range of colors, paint schemes and different wheels to help distinguish the different trim lines and special packages. For commercial customers, there’s a pickup-box-delete option, so custom service bodies can be adapted to the chassis.\n\nPowerScope tow mirrors standard on some models; manual telescoping trailer mirror standard on others\nAvailable moonroof on crew cab\nFront and rear step bumpers help access engine bay, cargo box\nAvailable tubular side steps or running boards\nOff-road package includes skid plates\nPower-sliding rear window standard on Lariat, available on other models\nAvailable tailgate step\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty has a luxury option for almost every application. Like the off-road look of the FX4 but want heated leather seats, the Sync entertainment system and a six-CD changer? Order the FX4 Luxury Package.\n\nOther packages include the Lariat Plus, Lariat Ultimate and the Cabela’s Luxury Package. Certain packages require specific trim levels. The Harley-Davidson F-450 and King Ranch have front and rear captain’s chairs with leather-trimmed center consoles. On diesel models, there’s an available Rapid-Heat supplemental heater to warm up the cab quickly on cold mornings.\n\nAvailable premium sound system with eight speakers and a subwoofer\nAvailable navigation, Sirius Satellite Radio\nAll sound systems have auxiliary input jack for MP3 players\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nFlexFold rear seat provides steel load floor\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n300-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshafts and three valves per cylinder, rated at 365 pounds-feet of peak torque\n362-hp, 6.8-liter V-10, with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshaft and three valves per cylinder, rated at 457 pounds-feet of peak torque\n350-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 turbo-diesel, iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and four valves per cylinder, rated at 650 pounds-feet of peak torque (325-hp and 600 pounds-feet of torque for F-450 models)\nSix-speed manual transmission (standard on all three engines)\nFive-speed automatic transmission (available on all three engines)\n\nSafety\nThe Super Duty comes with antilock brakes, massive four-wheel disc brakes and front airbags.

      "expert_review": "We’ve seen the wildly redesigned heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado and its cousin, the GMC Sierra HD. We’ve been behind the wheel of the new Ram HD pickup trucks as well. And now here it is, finally, the last of the big redesigned trucks: the 2020 Ford Super Duty. Yes, I know, it doesn’t look all that different from the 2019 version, but I assure you, Ford’s done its homework in making the 2020 Super Duty appealing and even more competitive than before.\n\nRelated:  2020 Ford Super Duty: Did the Blue Oval Go Far Enough?\n\nThis is a mid-cycle refresh, as Ford calls it, not a full-on redesign like we saw with the GM trucks. So don’t expect any big styling changes or interior differences, because there aren’t any. What we have instead is a lot of powertrain, suspension and technology work that’s been performed under the hood, combined with a compelling new off-road package that is sure to grab some attention. So if it doesn’t look different outside and it doesn’t look different inside, where the heck did Ford’s product developers spend all the redesign money? They spent it on the underside.\n\nThey spent it on an all-new 7.3-liter gasoline V-8 engine that makes a best-in-class 430 horsepower and 475 pounds-feet of torque. And they spent it on a revised third-generation Power Stroke turbo-diesel 6.7-liter V-8 making a best-in-class 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 pounds-feet of torque. And they spent it on a brand-new 10-speed automatic transmission with three overdrive gears, up to six drive modes and an available power takeoff with a best-in-class maximum of 300 pounds-feet of torque when paired with the diesel engine.\n\nBoth of the engines are fantastic. The new 7.3-liter tows like a champ, and mated to the 10-speed automatic, it feels powerful and responsive in all conditions. I didn’t tow anywhere near the Super Duty’s maximum ratings, but the trailers provided by Ford were representative of what people normally tow with these trucks. From 9,000-pound horse trailers to 11,000-pound campers, neither powertrain had so much as a hiccup in its performance. The best powertrain for towing is, of course, the 6.7-liter diesel engine, mostly due to its superior engine braking abilities when negotiating a downhill stretch. But the new 7.3-liter gas engine is no slouch either and would serve those who occasionally tow but don’t want to splurge on the pricey diesel option. When the trucks are empty, both engines are fantastic performers. The diesel is more responsive than before, now offering some forward thrust with no turbo lag and lightning-fast, smooth downshifts. Both engines are also surprisingly quiet, even under load going up a hill. It’s clear that powertrain refinement was a goal for the Super Duty engineers, and they’ve succeeded admirably.\n\nSo what does all that do for the new Super Duty? It lets Ford claim a whole bunch of best-in-class ratings: payload capacity of 7,850 pounds with the standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 while the diesel gets a maximum gooseneck towing of 37,000 pounds, fifth-wheel towing of 32,500 pounds and bumper towing of 24,200 pounds. But two of these claims are predicated on you buying an Super Duty F-450, which was not a common model in 2019; the F-250 and F-350 are much more popular. The F-250 and F-350 can also claim some best-in-class ratings, from best gooseneck maximum towing to best dually payload ratings. But honestly, best-in-class numbers don’t impress me much. I’m much more interested in how the vehicles drive and operate, and given the big powertrain and suspension changes Ford has made, that’s where I focused my attention.\n\nThe New Tremor Package\n\nThe bigger difference in towing performance came when I switched from a conventional Super Duty to one equipped with the new Tremor Off-Road Package. What’s a Tremor? Unlike before, when the Tremor name was used on an F-150 to denote a special performance version of the half ton, now it’s an equipment package that you can add to a new Super Duty. Ford has cooked this up for the off-road truck enthusiast buyer — the recreationist, one who takes a Super Duty, adds a bunch of parts and turns it into a bro dozer. You know, one of those big off-road trucks with enormous wheels and tires and a lifted suspension, often seen blowing big black clouds of soot out its diesel exhaust pipe? Well, Ford isn’t going to help you screw up your emissions, but now it is offering something that gets you one step closer to a factory bro dozer: the new 2020 F-250 or F-350 Tremor.\n\nThis thing is aimed squarely at the Ram 2500 Power Wagon and the GMC Sierra HD AT4. Ford bills it as both a workhorse and an adventure rig, something able to tow like an HD truck should, but also play like a lot of people increasingly want an HD truck to play. You can add the package to the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch or Platinum trim levels of the F-250 and F-350 as long as it’s the 4×4, single-rear-wheel SuperCrew model with a 6 3/4-foot bed. Like the Ram Power Wagon, it features big tires, 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTracs mounted on 18-inch matte-black wheels. It gets a front-end lift, progressive rate springs and custom 1.7-inch-piston twin-tube shocks. You get a locking rear differential with electronic shift-on-the-fly engagement and a Dana limited-slip front diff. A 12,000-pound Warn winch can be fitted to the front bumper from the factory. And unlike the Ram Power Wagon, you can get the Super Duty Tremor package with a diesel engine — Ram won’t let you do that, since its winch placement screws up the plumbing for the Cummins diesel engine.\n\nSo how do the modifications to the Super Duty work as a Tremor? Well, you can tow with it, given that it has all the excellent powertrain upgrades that other Super Duty trucks have, but it’s not as happy as the other models in doing so. The front end is lighter, the suspension is softer and it’s not really at home as a towing rig. Instead, it’s really meant to boost the Super Duty’s off-road ability, and this it does quite well.\n\nI drove an example through some impressively challenging rock quarry terrain that one wouldn’t assume a huge, portly, heavy-duty truck could negotiate. But thanks to a combination of parts like the big dampers, tires and a screen displaying novel forward-facing and 360-degree camera views, you can take a Tremorized Super Duty through some very tight obstacles and over some completely blind hills with confidence. The Tremor also comes with Trail Control, which acts as a kind of off-road cruise control: It helps you maintain speed going both down a hill and back up it again. That can be useful when you want to focus on maintaining a line over a challenging obstacle and not have to worry about throttle inputs. It also features a Rock Crawl mode meant for making easy work of boulder fields, but I found that it didn’t damp the throttle inputs quite enough to smooth out the jerks and starts. Still, the changes Ford has made for the Tremor package are impressive, and it will give the Power Wagon and Sierra AT4 a good run for the money — at least until they encounter an obstacle that sees the Power Wagon lock its front axle as well.\n\nLooks the Same, Inside and Out\n\nThe new Super Duty isn’t exactly the same in appearance as the outgoing model; there are a few updates to keep it fresh, but you’ll have to look hard to spot them. It has a new grille and headlights, some slightly different bumpers, new wheels and a couple of new colors, but no, it really doesn’t look any different from the outside than the outgoing model. Hey, you want crazy, wacky styling changes? I know there’s a Chevrolet dealer near you with some pretty hefty discounts on a new 2020 Silverado HD right now, but Ford’s not having it. People apparently like the way the Super Duty looks, given the continued sales supremacy that the trucks enjoy. At least, Ford had better hope they do, because what you see is what dealers will be stuck with for the next several years at least.\n\nOn the inside, it’s the same situation. The new HD looks the same as the old one: no big improvements to the materials, no fancy new 12-inch vertical displays, no crazy lighting schemes, not even any unusual colors. The Platinum gets some nicer materials, and the King Ranch interior still looks sumptuous in brown leather. There is some new technology, however, with the arrival of Ford’s still amazing Pro Trailer Backup Assist — it debuted on the F-150 for the 2016 model year — to help you not only connect a trailer but also to help you drive with it behind you. You can’t make the trailer disappear in the rearview display like you can with the Chevrolet trailer system, but you can’t steer the entire truck and trailer combination when backing up with a simple knob on the dash in a Silverado like you now can in a Ford Super Duty. And you can do it with a gooseneck trailer as well, something you couldn’t do before. There’s even something called Trailer Reverse Guidance that helps suggest your next moves when backing up your rig. Pro Trailer Backup Assist takes some preparation of the trailer before you can use it, and it does require you to purchase some extra equipment, but this system turns any novice into a professional truck driver with very little drama. It’s worth whatever Ford is charging for it in peace of mind alone.\n\nStill Not Cheap\n\nFor 2020, a new Super Duty truck can be had at a variety of price levels, depending on how nice and well equipped you want your truck. They start at a low of $35,300 (all prices include destination) for a base F-250 XL model, and can stretch all the way up to $92,125 for a well-equipped F-450 Limited. It won’t be uncommon to see trucks like this selling in the $60,000-$80,000 range, which is sadly common for today’s heavy-duty trucks.\n\nSo if you’re looking for the latest flashy styling or ultra-luxe interior or gee-whiz connectivity technology, you’re going to have to look elsewhere, as the latest 2020 Ford Super Duty doesn’t have any of that. What it does have is massive capability, unshakable competency and a reputation for delivering on its promises that this new version with its new powertrains is only going to make greater than ever.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty XL proves that you don’t need to spend crazy money to get a super capable, spacious, relatively efficient work truck.\n\nVersus the competition: The Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and Ram 2500 both outgun the base F-250 in power, torque and towing capability, but all offer comparable technology at a comparable price; picking one is more a matter of preference and available cash incentives.\n\nHave a look at one of the most popular vehicles in the land — the basic work pickup truck. This example is the 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty done up in the lowliest, base XL trim level. It has vinyl seats and floors. There’s no fancy trim in here, no power retractable running boards, nothing that detracts from this truck’s mission: Get things done. Pull stuff, plow stuff, haul stuff, tow stuff.\n\nAs a result of this single-mindedness, the price tag for this example of Dearborn’s finest engineering is uncharacteristically low — it barely topped $44,000 as tested. But is a heavy-duty pickup with such a low price tag any good? Does it actually get the job done? Lacking much in the way of creature comforts and amenities, will you want to push it off a cliff before your workday is done?\n\nSo Long, So Very Long\n\nThe model I tested is not a common configuration; it was a long-wheelbase, long-bed SuperCrew four-door model with a gas engine. To call it long would be an understatement: Imagine piloting a seagoing cargo vessel around your town, and that’s not far off the mark. Parking is an adventure, corners are taken extra-wide, and there won’t be much room for anything else in your driveway. But that’s OK, as this is just one configuration out of dozens available for the Super Duty.\n\nThe XL trim doesn’t have much of the bling that other trim levels do, but it still has a goodly amount of chrome (because pickups need chrome in order to be pickups in some parts of the country). Bumpers front and rear are shiny, but the massive shieldlike grille is black plastic. There are no fancy LED headlights here, just standard halogen lamps up front and in back. No fancy wheels, either: You’ve got standard 17-inch steelies all around shod with Michelin LTX M/S2 tires, which are a surprisingly high-end brand for such a basic work truck and likely a strong reason why this Super Duty is so quiet at speed.\n\nAdequately Powered, Outgunned by Competitors\n\nPowering this version of the Super Duty is a standard 6.2-liter V-8 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. There’s also an optional Power Stroke turbo-diesel, but it’s significantly more expensive. The base engine cranks out a healthy 385 horsepower and 430 pounds-feet of torque, significant numbers for a naturally aspirated engine, but it’s outgunned by the competition: By comparison, the Ram 2500 Tradesman’s base engine is a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 making 410 hp and 429 pounds-feet of torque mated to an eight-speed automatic, beating the Ford in horsepower and roughly matching it in torque. And the upcoming 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500’s base engine is a 6.6-liter V-8 making 401 hp and 464 pounds-feet of torque. For 2020, the Super Duty will get some new powertrains, but the base engine and transmission combination carries over unchanged, so opinions here will also likely apply to the new, refreshed model’s powertrain, as well. A 7.3-liter V-8 will join the lineup, but as Ford hasn’t published any output data yet, we can’t tell you if it will be competitive.\n\nAs good as Ford’s turbocharged V-6 engines are in the lesser half-ton models, there’s really no beating the V-8 in this three-quarter-ton truck. Smooth and quiet, the power it produces is always just a quick, light stab of the accelerator pedal away. It’s accompanied by a signature rumble that just seems to fit perfectly with a big pickup like this. Sure, you can opt for the big turbo-diesel 6.7-liter Power Stroke, but now you’re looking at adding a huge chunk of change to the bottom line — $9,120 to be precise, and that will defeat the idea of this being a reasonably priced work truck. For towing, the diesel is hard to beat, but the gas engine is no slouch, either: The payload rating on this specific version of the F-250 Super Duty is 3,660 pounds, and the max tow rating is 12,900 pounds from either the bumper or the fifth-wheel/gooseneck position. It should be noted that a comparable new 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 is rated to tow a 14,500-pound trailer, and a similar Ram 2500 can manage 14,580 pounds, both with a 3.73 axle. If my F-250 Super Duty had the more aggressive 4.10 rear axle, its capacity would be boosted to 15,400 pounds, but this rig was equipped with the more fuel-friendly 3.73.\n\nThe ride in a pickup like this is always going to be questionable when there’s no load in the bed — heavy-duty springs and shocks meant to carry thousands of pounds of cargo have to be robust, and that usually translates into a choppy, bouncy ride. The Super Duty does exhibit this behavior, but not nearly as much as I’ve experienced in other heavy-duty pickups. Credit the long wheelbase for smoothing out a lot of the undulations and road imperfections that would normally set your teeth chattering over broken pavement; in this example of the Super Duty, it’s a bit rough, but it’s not unpleasant or unbearable.\n\nMost surprising is how well the big truck handles. Despite its obvious size and bulk, the Super Duty is as nimble as it can be, with steering that’s slow but direct and responsive. The truck doesn’t wallow in its lane, doesn’t wander on the highway, doesn’t feel ponderous or lazy in its body control. Ford engineers have done an excellent job making the Super Duty feel confident, solid and planted around town and on the interstate.\n\nThe 3.73 axle and high-quality Michelin tires contribute to fuel economy that’s better than expected. We performed a 200-mile loop to see how much this monster drinks, and we were pleasantly surprised at the results. Automakers aren’t required to report fuel economy numbers on vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating more than 8,500 pounds, and the Super Duty qualifies for that exemption (originally meant for commercial trucks and not personal-use pickups). We observed 14.6 mpg in city stop-and-go traffic, climbing to an average of 15.5 mpg on the highway. Overall, the observed consumption calculated out to 15.7 mpg, which when combined with the massive fuel tank in this long-wheelbase, long-bed Super Duty, would’ve given it an unloaded range of around 750 miles.\n\nA Useful Interior: Frugal, Not Fancy\n\nThe defining characteristic of this specific Super Duty is the frugality of the thing, and that shines through in the cabin. It’s bare-bones in here, with vinyl seats and vinyl floors, a complete absence of wood trim either fake or real, no soft-touch padding and even a vestigial bench seat up front to allow for a theoretical sixth occupant. But that’s perfectly fine, honestly — it’s refreshing to get a truck that has a purity of purpose, a work truck that looks and feels as if it’s actually meant for work, not for being a substitute for a luxury car.\n\nThe F-Series cabins are all quite spacious, and the F-250 SuperCrew with its full four doors is cavernous. There’s room for five people to stretch out, six if you want to illegally squeeze four people onto the back bench. You can try and put that sixth person in the center position on the front bench seat, where there’s a dedicated seat belt, but where they’re supposed to put their legs is a mystery. The transmission tunnel takes up any room there, and their knees would be hard up against the center console. Despite the sixth seat belt, it really is still just a five-occupant pickup regardless of its size.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, your options are a bit limited in this model. There’s no height adjustability for the driver’s seat and no telescoping steering wheel. Seats are manually adjusted and frankly aren’t very comfortable. We’ve had this complaint with Ford’s pickup seats for some time — the seat bottoms feel unnaturally short, while the lumbar support feels overly aggressive, making you feel like you’re sitting on the edge of a small seat despite the voluminous space in the cabin. They’re not terribly supportive either — after 200 miles of fuel economy testing, my back ached and my butt was numb. The backseats are more comfortable, and they fold up to reveal a flat load floor, useful for loading big items that you don’t want to expose to the elements and potential theft by hauling them in the open bed.\n\nThe list of amenities is short but mostly complete. My test truck was meant to be a towing rig and added some useful electronics such as the Ultimate Trailer Tow Camera system, which brings a 360-degree camera view to the optional big Sync 3 multimedia display. It’s invaluable for driving this behemoth through anything other than wide-open country — it makes parking in a suburban strip mall lot a little less stressful (but not a lot less), and hooking up a trailer would be a breeze thanks to the aids it provides. The blind spot warning system was also present on my test truck as an option to help on the highway, as it’s rather difficult to see small vehicles beside you given the bulk and height of the Super Duty. The XL Value Package brings cruise control and an AM/FM stereo while the Power Equipment Group added power windows and locks, a must-have in a vehicle this big lest you find yourself constantly leaning over the wide seats to unlock the door for a passenger or to crank their window closed. What doesn’t it have that it should? A rear-window defroster and a few more 110-volt outlets are about all this truck lacks to be the perfect work truck.\n\nThe F-250 gets a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the big truck. Ford Co-Pilot360 hasn’t made it to the Super Duty yet, so there’s no standard forward collision warning or automatic emergency braking (they’re not available at all with this trim level). The best you get is a backup camera and the aforementioned optional blind spot warning system.\n\nBargain Truck, Bargain Price\n\nIt’s refreshing to see a truck that isn’t priced into the stratosphere. The base price for this rig is $38,540 (including destination fee) for the SuperCrew 4×2 version. My test vehicle included $5,770 in options, bringing the grand total to $44,310. This makes it something of a bargain, middle-weight towing rig equipped with the gooseneck hitch, gas engine and single-rear-wheel axle. It’s able to tow more than a similar light-duty F-150 and can do so more safely, but it still falls well short of the crazy capabilities of far more expensive, stronger F-350 Super Duty trucks with diesel engines and dual-rear-wheel axles.\n\nGiven that pickups are highly competitive segments, it won’t surprise you to learn that you can build a comparable Chevy or Ram for comparable money. The Ram offers items on the Tradesman that Ford doesn’t on the Super Duty, such as forward collision warning, automatic cruise control with full stop and more. What it doesn’t offer is the full 8.4-inch Uconnect multimedia system available on the half-ton Ram, which leaves it with a smaller screen than the Ford’s full Sync 3 touchscreen (which itself isn’t all that big compared to some newer screens). As for the new Silverado 2500 HD, we’re still waiting to get a shot at it as of publication, but it also stacks up well on paper with its new capabilities, big power numbers and updated onboard tech.\n\nIt’s great to know that work trucks meant for work still exist and can be had for a reasonable sum. The 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty meets all kinds of expectations, even at the low end of the trim spectrum. Performing as well as it does for the price makes it an excellent buy.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Ah, spring. Warm breezes, quenching mists, a time of flowers, young buds, tender sprouts, tissue-soft leaves and fecund soil; a time of renewal, when the fancies of many people turn to . . . big-honkin’ pickup trucks.\n\nAfter all, we’ve got garages and cellars to clean; the detritus of winter to move from our yards; loam and manure and railroad ties and rocks to haul; lumber to truck in for new decks and docks and sheds. What more utilitarian vehicle for many of us to own at this time of year than a pickup truck?\n\nIt was just over 50 years ago that Henry Ford himself spotted this looming need and one of the last projects he oversaw at Ford Motor Co. was the development of the F-Series pickup trucks, arguably the most enduring of its ilk in auto history.\n\nToday, the pickup truck is in constant transition and, to the surprise of folks at Ford, some of its biggest trucks, developed with contractors in mind, are now selling to the general public. And why not? They’ll seat six comfortably, have the 4WD panache of an SUV, and have that pickup truck bed. And in a day when size matters to many, they are huge.\n\nWe’re rolling up and out of Boston’s North End and onto Interstate 93 in the 1999 F250 Supercab. It felt big on entry, since that was a step-to-running-board and then step-into-cab-from-there affair. It feels even bigger looking out the driver’s side window and down into the lap of someone sitting in . . . a Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nEase out onto the highway and open up its V-10 Triton engine and this beast charges down the lane. Gain speed and hold it and some remarkable traits are noticeable.\n\nGiven how high it sits off the ground — creating a potential wind tunnel underneath — and the huge mirrors that radiate like wings from each front doorpost, this is an aerodynamically quiet vehicle. Even tire noise — and these are serious, gnarly truck tires — is minimal.\n\nThe engine, 6.8 liters pushing out 275 horses, is noticeable but not intrusive. It sounds more like a strong and distant wind blowing somewhere out on the stretching mesa that is the hood than it does any thumping engine of stressed steel.\n\nConsider that this engine puts out 410 lbs.-ft. of torque and you are into the diesel league in that category, serious hauling and towing capacity without the loud and incessant chatter, or the smell, of diesel.\n\nAnd in any truck or SUV, with their specific design intent, torque talks far louder than horsepower. The difference: Consider a track star and a mountain climber. The track star’s horsepower can send her flying down the track. But strap an 80-pound pack on that nimble track star and another on the seasoned climber and ask each to put one leg up on a step at waist level and hoist themselves up on the power of that leg, and the woman who’s climbed mountains will push up with far more ease. That’s torque.\n\nIt’s what let this F250, its front tires set against an 18-inch ledge in th e woods, push itself up and over from a dead stop.\n\nIt’s what let it be hooked to a trailer hauling a 22-foot waterski boat with its own 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, and pull it with ease. At speed — 60 m.p.h. and less than 2,000 rpms — the presence of the trailer and boat were not even noticeable.\n\nWhile smooth and relatively quiet on the highway, its stiffness was noticeable even on small bumps, cracks, or even pressure plates on the ends of bridges and ramps. One jolt dropped the rearview mirror from the center of the windshield.\n\nYet it is quite a comfortable truck for long trips. Its front bench seat holds three adults easily. Three could ride in the back — accessed with a door on each side — but it would not be fun on a long trip. Three kids are OK back there.\n\nIf Aretha Franklin sang about this truck, the song would be “RESPECT” — as in that’s what you get from drivers who might otherwise challenge you on the road.\n\nIn Massachusetts rotaries, its heer size imposed what neither the law, common sense, nor common courtesy has been able to do: acknowledgement that a vehicle already in the rotary has the right of way.\n\nBut with mass comes responsibility. In traffic, you must drive this truck far more carefully — and differently — than you would other vehicles. Its rear end sits so high that smaller cars can virtually disappear behind it. They shouldn’t be that close, but folks do that and you have to be aware of them.\n\nBecause of its massive wheelbase, turns must be anticipated — and thus announced — earlier, and they must be made slightly wider.\n\nFinding a place to park in the city is problematic and some tight turns into alleys or parking lots are nearly impossible.\n\nOff road, it has plenty of power, of course, and its bite in mud and muck and water and gravel and sand is phenomenal. The problem is, the deeper you get into the woods, the narrower the roads become. If you’ve done any serious four-wheeling you know that you sometimes have to squeeze between trees on narrow roads and — bane of 4WDers — sometimes turn around and go back. There are places out there just too tight for this truck to pass through and places where you might get stuck and not have the space to turn around.\n\nExpect between 10 and 13 miles per gallon from a 38-gallon tank and expect crowds to gather around it when you park it. In my neck of New Hampshire it drew them. My pal “Big Truck” Mike Delisle took one look at it down at the local baseball field, forgot all about his cup of coffee and crawled over, under, around and through it. He particularly liked the tow package with its grill-mounted transmission cooler, the separate fuse box for all trailer electrics, and the myriad tie-in options to those electrics that come standard on the F250.\n\nAnd women, who virtually ignored recent past appearances of a BMW sports car, a turbocharged Volkswagen Beetle, and a $70,000 Mercedes in my little town, were far more interested in this beast.\n\nAnd at the heart of that may be something that Ford Motor Co. says it has noticed: families looking to get into trucks the manfacturer thought would sell almost exclusively to industry and contractors.\n\nThis is not a truck for the city; it is not even a truck you’d want to use to drop into the city from the suburbs. It is not an offroad truck in the pure sense. It was not designed to be any of these things, really. But if you’ve got hauling to do — big loads or kids or both — it would not look bad in your yard.\n\nNice touches:\n\n— The back row of moving clips to match the buttons that hold down the tarp covering the bed. Ever try to stretch a cold tarp to a fixed button? These do the job for you.\n\n— The huge center console that is available when you fold down the back of the middle seat in front.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n— It is forgivable that the windshield mirror fell off on a bump; it is not forgi vable that even when it stayed in place, it kept drooping out of place and there was no way to adjust for its loose balljoint attachment.\n\n— Why do the rear door handles have to be tucked inside the door frame, accessible only when the front door is open? Why not put them outside on the door?\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nThe numbers\n\nBase price:$25,055\n\nPrice as tested: $32,110\n\nHorsepower/Torque:\n\n275 hp/410 lbs.-ft.\n\nWheelbase/Overall length:\n\n158 inches/243.3 inches\n\nWidth/Height: 79.9 inches/77.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,724 lbs.\n\nSeating: 6 passengers\n\nSOURCE: Manufacturer",
