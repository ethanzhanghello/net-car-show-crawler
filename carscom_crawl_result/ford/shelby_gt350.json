      "expert_review": "Top to bottom, the 2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 features the right performance-minded hardware to live up to its claim as the most track-capable Mustang that Ford’s ever built.\n\nRedesigned for 2015, the Mustang’s sophomore year welcomes its newest variant, the track-oriented 2016 Shelby GT350 and GT350R. These cars are anything but a simple appearance package or a few bolt-ons; this is not a repeat of the Mustang Shelby GT from a few years ago.\n\nPerhaps the most drastic in a long list of changes are an all-new 526-horsepower, 5.2-liter V-8, a significantly reworked suspension — optionally with Ford’s first use of magnetic-style adaptive shock absorbers — and big-stopping-power brakes. Then there’s the GT350R, which is the ultimate-handling Mustang with super sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 Tires, carbon-fiber wheels, a huge downforce-generating wing and roughly 120 pounds of convenience features removed.\n\nIt’s hard to pin down a competitive set for the GT350 and GT350R coupes. While the 707-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is a surprisingly capable handler, it’s still very much a straight-line machine compared with the GT350’s capabilities. The next-generation Chevrolet Camaro is too young for any specialty versions, leaving you to look beyond muscle cars. That’s where I think the rear-wheel-drive Shelby’s closest competitor lies: For me, the GT350 is closer to a BMW M4 in how it drives. Bet you didn’t see that coming. Compare the GT350 to the Hellcat and M4 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe GT350’s bodywork from the windshield forward is unique to this Shelby and aimed to create as minimal an aerodynamic signature as possible, while improving the nose’s cooling and airflow characteristics. The hood is 2 inches lower, and its outlet extracts heat and reduces front-end lift. The front fenders are re-contoured to fit the wider track and wider wheels up front.\n\nStandard 19-inch GT350 alloy wheels are 10.5 inches wide in front and 11 inches wide in back, while GT350R models roll on all-carbon-fiber wheels, 11 inches wide in front and 11.5 inches in back. At the rear of the Shelby GT350 is a standard lip spoiler that becomes a larger lip spoiler on Track Package models and an all-out carbon fiber wing on the GT350R.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe GT350’s V-8 is a highlight of the car when stretched to its mind-boggling 8,250 rpm redline. At and approaching redline, the symphony of spent combustion that blasts out the pipes should be illegal. All it does is make you want to hammer down on the long pedal in this Shelby over and over again — a desire I was happy to oblige during a recent test on Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, Calif.\n\nA valve-operated exhaust system has much-appreciated mild to wild modes, allowing you to deafen passengers while barreling through a tunnel, then sneak back into your neighborhood undetected. In full-bore mode, the GT350’s exhaust might be the loudest exhaust system I’ve heard on a factory car.\n\nLet’s revisit that 8,250 rpm redline. It’s insane to wind out a bone-stock, factory V-8 in a Mustang to those kinds of speeds and not feel like the connecting rods are going to blast out of the engine block. The unique flat-plane crankshaft is responsible for the high engine speeds and the quickness of the revs; it gave Ford engineers the ability to open up the cylinder head, intake and camshaft to unleash more power, and it’s the crankshaft configuration that gives the GT350 such a unique exhaust sound.\n\nThe practicality of an 8,250 rpm engine is best experienced on the track, where the GT350 can stretch its legs between corners without having to upshift. When you do have to upshift, a new 6-speed manual transmission designed to match the high rpm characteristics of the 5.2-liter allows lightning-quick shifting with a light but precise shifter and clutch pedal.\n\nThere’s a lot of room in the span of 8,000 rpm for an engine to be down on power and lb.-ft of torque, but the 5.2-liter’s well-distributed torque above 3,500 rpm — and peak of 429 pounds-feet at 4,750 rpm — means the engine is punchy and can still pull out of its way at lower engine speeds, up to maximum power at 7,500 rpm. Some rev-happy engines aren’t happy off the track, but the 5.2-liter is wholeheartedly entertaining on canyon roads and even in straight-line bursts of acceleration. An added bonus is that the engine maintains decent power past redline, though below 3,500 rpm you really do have to be in the right gear. Don’t even try to pass in 6th; it just won’t work.\n\nYou won’t find levels of acceleration here that pin you to the back of your seat, like in the 662-hp 2014 Shelby GT500 or the 707-hp 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. No, the GT350 is more focused on delivering balance and precision despite having 91 more horsepower than the 5.0-liter Mustang GT.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis, responsiveness and feedback of the steering, and the car’s overall composure are more reminiscent of a BMW M4 than a Mustang. Ford went through the Mustang’s chassis and replaced numerous bearings with more rigid pieces. It also redesigned the front steering knuckle to be stiffer and lighter, widened the front track and thickened the anti-roll bars. Add in the Brembo-brand six-piston front brakes and four-piston rears, which replace the wimpy single-piston rears on the GT, and the GT350 has all the goods you’d expect in a track-specific Shelby model. Perhaps the best thing going for the Mustang in comparison with the M4 is that the GT350’s exhaust doesn’t sound like a weed whacker.\n\nMagneRide is the hot, new suspension setup that makes the GT350 such a performer. The optional system popularized by General Motors and now employed by many automakers uses iron-impregnated fluid passing through electro-magnetic fields to continually adjust damper performance for road conditions. Base GT350s use a fixed-firmness suspension, while MagneRide is optional as part of the Track and Tech packages.\n\nMagneRide is adjustable using what Ford calls integrated driver control. The system features Normal, Sport, Weather, Track and Drag driving modes that tailor MagneRide’s responsiveness and firmness — along with exhaust modes, engine responsiveness, steering firmness, electronic stability and traction settings — for specific driving styles. The GT350R gets its own unique MagneRide tuning.\n\nThere’s not a huge range of road comfort separation between the driving modes, however. The base mode is called Normal, not Comfort, for good reason. The GT350 exhibits noticeable noise and taut composure on the road even in the softest mode. But I think that works. Like the M4, the GT350’s slightly disruptive ride is a constant reminder that you’re driving something special, even if it means an uncomfortable jolt every once in a while.\n\nI found the Shelby GT350 surprisingly easy to drive on the track. When things did start to get a little hairy — more likely from me getting off line than a characteristic of the car — the GT350 provided plenty of notice through a slight chatter in the front tires, indicating I should back off the accelerator and get the nose back in line. At no point did I think the rear end was going to whip out unprovoked. Every handling characteristic of the new Mustang GT with independent rear suspension is heightened, sharper and quicker in the GT350, which makes for a supremely confident handling machine. Even with the GT’s optional Performance Package, there’s still a fair amount of body roll while cornering, which is where the GT350 comes in with superior levels of body motion control. Compare the GT350 with the GT here.\n\nOf course, there’s good, and then there’s GT350R good. The R model carries significantly more cornering speed, with higher levels of grip from the wider, stickier tires and giant downforce-generating wing. Between corners at Laguna Seca, where the GT350 could ride out 3rd gear to the braking zone, the GT350R got off the corners with such speed that I could grab 4th gear in the same straight.\n\nIn Track mode, the stability system didn’t stick its nose in my business on the track, which is appreciated compared with some overactive sport modes — like the M4’s. Being a driver of intermediate skill, I prefer to keep the car in a mode with a safety net while learning a new track, which I was doing at Laguna Seca. Track mode’s stability and traction settings allow the car to slide a little, but keep a safety net in place to avoid spinning out. It didn’t hold the car back.\n\nInterior\nFord went back to the drawing board for the Recaro-brand seats that are standard in the GT350. The Mustang GT’s optional Recaro seats are sporty but not different enough from the standard seats to really be considered track seats. That’s all changed with the GT350’s seats, which are firmer with more pronounced side bolstering. Plus, the cloth-only construction keeps your butt planted more than in the GT Recaros’ slippery optional leather. The Technology Package replaces the Recaros with heated and ventilated leather seats.\n\nKeeping with the track-ready theme, a new shift light uses a head-up display and a string of LEDs to show how close the engine is to redline. It’s especially important in this car, because the high-revving 5.2-liter is so unique it’s easy to short shift (despite having a few hundred rpm to go) if you judge purely by sound. Independently adjustable from the driving modes, Tach, Track and Drag shift light modes display the lights differently, and I preferred Drag mode even on the road course because it simply flashes when it’s time to shift, as opposed to constantly having distracting LEDs dancing on the windshield with engine rpm.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe GT350’s standard multimedia system is nothing flashy or fancy. It uses the small screen from the base Mustang and has dual USB inputs, a CD player and an AM/FM radio. The small screen is surrounded by a sea of buttons, so it takes a lot of familiarity to know where everything is placed.\n\nI was unable to sample the optional multimedia system with Ford’s latest Sync 3 and 8-inch touch-screen. We’ll try to get our hands on that system in the future. Sync 3 is available only on the Tech Package ($7,500); it’s not a feature you can get with the Track Package.\n\nI’d like to see the aforementioned driving modes (Normal, Sport, Weather, Track and Drag) streamlined into more easily operated controls. The steering-wheel-button location is nice, but you have to scroll through the modes to select. Ford could take a lesson from BMW’s M cars, which have programmable buttons on the steering wheel for preset driving modes, so changing modes is as easy as hitting one button.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe GT350 retains the 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space and 50/50-split folding backseat of the base GT. The GT350R’s backseat is removed for weight savings and all that’s left is a molded insert where the backseat used to be; the insert doesn’t fold.\n\nSafety\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Mustang coupe an overall five-star crash-test rating, out of five stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested it. Like the regular Mustang, the GT350 and GT350R include a driver’s knee airbag, side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nA forward collision warning system and a blind spot warning system that are optional on the GT Premium Mustang are not offered on the GT350 or GT350R. A backup camera is standard on the GT350 but is deleted from the GT350R; adding it back again requires the $3,000 Electronics Package.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mustang GT350 and GT350R have the defined purpose of being corner-hugging thoroughbreds (what would a Mustang review be without an equestrian reference?). There’s an indisputable difference between the GT350 and the base Mustang GT that, for some, may make it an easy decision to fork out $50,000-plus for the GT350.\n\nThe GT350 starts at $48,695 (all prices include a destination fee), but that’s not the car you want. You want the $6,500 Track Package, which boosts the car to $55,195. That price doesn’t include the $1,300 gas-guzzler tax the GT350 is saddled with because it’s rated only 14/21/16 mpg city/highway/combined. Nor does it include the dealer markup that will surely be tacked onto this hotly desirable, limited-production car. A Ford Performance spokesman said GT350 production will be determined by demand, and Ford expects production numbers similar to the GT500 of recent years. The GT350R, however, will be much more rare, like the former Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition.\n\nGT350s with the aforementioned Track Package include all the bits and pieces you need to complete a track day worry-free. On the technology side, the Technology Package ($7,500) includes some of the Track Package’s features, but not all of them. Tech cars add navigation, Sync 3, the large multimedia screen, dual-zone climate control, leather seats that are powered, heated and ventilated, plus more.\n\nYou don’t get the Recaro seats or oil coolers with the Technology Package, while Track Package cars are stuck with the small media display and no Sync 3. It’s a bummer, really, that you can’t get Sync 3 and navigation with the Recaro seats and auxiliary oil coolers on the GT350 unless you step up to the GT350R with the Electronics Package, and that’s a $66,495 car. The Track Package is already a little heavier than a base Mustang GT, so why not let in a few extra pounds for buyers who want all the track goods as well as a modern multimedia system?\n\nIs it worth it? If you take this car to track days, the answer is a solid yes, as you’ll get one of the most unique and purpose-built Mustangs Ford has rolled off the assembly line in a long time. Even if you drive the Shelby GT350 only on the street, the beastly sound that emanates from the tailpipes during 8,250 rpm blasts will make you forget about the high price tag, if only momentarily.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Did you know that today is National Mustang Day? OK, neither did we until (who else?) Ford told us. Falling so close to Easter this year, the automaker ensured it wouldn’t have its thunder stolen by a giant egg-caching bunny by laying an Easter egg of its own: the return of the top-performing ‘Stangs — the Shelby GT350 and GT350R — for the 2018 model year.\n\nRelated: Healthy as a Horse? 2018 Ford Mustang Has Pony’s Pulse\n\nThe Shelby will again be powered by the 2017 version’s 5.2-liter V-8 that cranks out 526 horsepower and 429 pounds-feet of torque. For comparison, the 2017 GT model has a 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 435 hp, while the base model has a 3.7-liter V-6 that makes 300 hp. That’s in addition to the Shelby’s braking bona fides courtesy of 15.5-inch two-piece front rotors and six-piston Brembo calipers. It also features a MagneRide damping system.\n\nAll that carries over to 2018, but buyers will have a choice of three new exterior colors: Orange Fury, Kona Blue and Lead Foot Gray. Available on both the GT350 and GT350R are the Electronics Package, which includes Ford’s Sync 3 multimedia system, voice-activated navigation and a nine-speaker stereo, and the Convenience Package on GT350 models only, replacing the Recaro manual sport seats with six-way power-adjustable heated and cooled sport seats with suede inserts.\n\nThe Shelby — which Ford calls “the most track-capable, street legal Mustang ever built — will make its way back into showrooms this fall. Ford didn’t specify whether the outgoing model’s price would carry over, but the 2017 GT350 starts at $57,045, which includes a $900 destination charge and $1,300 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nCan’t hold out until fall or just can’t pony up the cash for this pony car? You can still celebrate National Mustang Day by enjoying the sweet sound of the iconic sports coupe’s signature growl. Ford is offering a free downloadable ringtone of the 2018 Mustang GT’s actual engine rev as it bombs to 155 mph in Track mode, which makes full use of the all-new active valve performance exhaust and newly available 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\n“We created this system to provide customers with a sound experience that best complements the exhilaration of driving the Mustang,” said Carl Widmann, Mustang chief engineer, in a statement. “The total excitement is something you don’t just feel, you hear.”\n\nHear the sound and fury, signifying Mustang, here.",

      "expert_review": "Ford has made a lot of different kinds of Mustangs since the originals wowed the world back in 1964 — some with big V-8s, some with turbocharged four-bangers, none with hybrid electric systems (yet). In some years they’ve been great, and in some years they’ve been awful. But with the updates to the 2019 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350, we’re starting to use phrases like “best Mustang ever made,” and it’s not just empty hyperbole.\n\nThe outgoing GT350 was a fantastic car, and the lightly updated 2019 model only improves on that car. “You’ve got to keep it fresh, keep it updated,” the Mustang’s chief program engineer Carl Widmann told us. That’s what Ford did for the GT350 for 2019, and the result is a sharper, stronger, better car even than the fantastic pony car that came before it.\n\nRelated: 2019 Ford Shelby GT350 Mustang Is Tweaked for Speed\n\nA Beast on the Circuit\n\nI took the new GT350 around the M1 Concourse track, a short, not-terribly-high-speed circuit in suburban Detroit that allowed me to see what the improvements amount to. They are subtle but welcome: Downforce has been improved thanks to a new spoiler and a new active-aero grille, both of which help the car stick in higher-speed turns. The GT350’s electric power steering is accurate and surprisingly light, allowing for quick turn-in and exceptional control through sweepers. A lot of the improvements center on the tires — new, specially developed Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 meats that were created with the input of Ford Performance engineering. Sized P295/35ZR19 front and P305/35ZR19 rear, their super-sticky characteristics allowed Ford engineers to modify a host of chassis items including the MagneRide electronic suspension tuning, the spring rates, damper tuning, roll-bar thickness, antilock braking performance and more.\n\nThe result is one of the most planted, easy-to-drive-fast Mustangs I’ve ever piloted around a road course. Last summer, we pitted the latest 2018 GT Performance Pack 1 and Performance Pack 2 against both each other and some more expensive iron at GingerMan Raceway in western Michigan. The GT350 feels very similar to that PP2 model, both of them tuned to be amazing track stars. Surprisingly, the PP2 features wider Michigan Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires than the GT350 (P305/30ZR19 front and rear). But the biggest difference comes from under the hood. While the GT’s standard 460-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 is a tremendous engine that delivers as much visceral thrill as you might imagine, the GT350’s 526-hp, flat-plane-crank 5.2-liter V-8 sounds unlike any V-8 that’s ever been fitted to an American car. The ripping snarl as it barrels down a straightaway is pure symphonic gearhead bliss, and while the extra 66 hp doesn’t really make it feel that much quicker than the GT PP2, the experience of its free-revving nature and completely different tone make it worth the extra cost of entry. It’s the most powerful naturally aspirated engine Ford has ever put in a production car. It revs to an impossible 8,250 rpm and sounds absolutely amazing doing it.\n\nThe retune of the antilock braking system really isn’t noticeable either unless you’re driving the car hard enough to engage it, which I wasn’t able to do on this shorter, lower-speed track. Suffice it to say that the standard Brembo package on the GT350 is outstandingly strong, with repeated, fade-free braking into corners without any issues or wondering about the stoppers’ bite. Likewise, the tires never lost grip even when trying to induce some power-on oversteer out of corners. You’re likely to run out of track long before you run out of grip in the new GT350.\n\nOut on the Street\n\nAs magical as the beast is on the track, it’s a slightly different story out on the street. A good 45-minute stint through suburban Detroit in the GT350 revealed a car with a bit of a mixed personality — the ride is exceptionally forgiving thanks to the electronically adjustable MagneRide suspension that smooths out all manner of road imperfections and is never, ever as harsh as you might expect such a high-strung racer to be.\n\nThis doesn’t mean it’s smooth sailing in the GT350 — the sensitive, super-direct steering that’s wondrous on the track is laborious on the street. Like a Nissan GT-R, this is a “two-hands car,” meaning you’re going to want to keep both of them on the wheel at all times. On smooth, just-repaved tarmac, the GT350 sails along happy as you please — but on broken, scarred or lumpy pavement, it’s all over the place, the wheel fighting you for directional control of the car. It’s improved from the past iteration of the GT350 I drove in 2018, but it’s still a handful that never lets you forget that you’re driving a track monster, regardless of how cushy the ride has been dialed back to or how quiet the adjustable exhaust has become.\n\nThe cosmetic changes to the GT350 are minor for 2019. The exterior gets a few new shades of blue and some new stripe options, plus the aforementioned spoiler changes and aero adjustments. The face is still that of the pre-2018-refresh Mustang, however, as going through a cooling validation and crash recertification for the small volume of GT350s sold every year would be prohibitively expensive. The interior gets some new dash and door-panel trim, a standard 8-inch Sync 3 touchscreen multimedia system and an optional 12-speaker B&O Play premium audio system. As before, Recaro racing seats are standard.\n\nIs the Engine Worth the Price?\n\nThe starting price for all of this is a sobering $60,235 including destination fee. Option it up with a bunch of goodies like the Technology Package and the Handling Package, and you can broach $65,000. Or opt for the truly track-ready GT350R, starting at $68,230, to get the true racecar-on-the-street experience.\n\nHere’s the problem: A bare-bones 2019 Mustang GT with Performance Pack 2 brings a bunch of goodies to the Mustang like the Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, tuned suspension, MagneRide adaptive dampers, improved aerodynamics and more for a lot less money. Even if you add in the Recaro sport seat package, you can get a track-monster Mustang for just about $46,000, meaning stepping up to the GT350 is a $14,000 premium for that bigger engine and some extra brake and suspension tuning. Is it worth adding another roughly 25 percent to the sticker price for that extra equipment? Is this really the best Mustang ever made, or does the less expensive GT PP2 fit that bill better? I sense that we may need another track test this summer to find out.\n\n2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2015 about the 2016 Mustang GT350. The 2017 addresses our packaging complaints now that the Track Package is standard, but little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nRedesigned for 2015, the Mustang’s sophomore year welcomes its newest variant, the track-oriented 2016 Shelby GT350 and GT350R. These cars are anything but a simple appearance package or a few bolt-ons; this is not a repeat of the Mustang Shelby GT from a few years ago.\n\nPerhaps the most drastic in a long list of changes are an all-new 526-horsepower, 5.2-liter V-8, a significantly reworked suspension — optionally with Ford’s first use of magnetic-style adaptive shock absorbers — and big-stopping-power brakes. Then there’s the GT350R, which is the ultimate-handling Mustang with super sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 Tires, carbon-fiber wheels, a huge downforce-generating wing and roughly 120 pounds of convenience features removed.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe GT350’s bodywork from the windshield forward is unique to this Shelby and aimed to create as minimal an aerodynamic signature as possible, while improving the nose’s cooling and airflow characteristics. The hood is 2 inches lower, and its outlet extracts heat and reduces front-end lift. The front fenders are re-contoured to fit the wider track and wider wheels up front.\n\nStandard 19-inch GT350 wheels are 10.5 inches wide in front and 11 inches wide in back, while GT350R models roll on all-carbon-fiber wheels, 11 inches wide in front and 11.5 inches in back. At the rear of the Shelby GT350 is a standard lip spoiler that becomes a larger lip spoiler on Track Package models and an all-out carbon fiber wing on the GT350R.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe GT350’s V-8 is a highlight of the car when stretched to its mind-boggling 8,250 rpm redline. At and approaching redline, the symphony of spent combustion that blasts out the pipes should be illegal. All it does is make you want to hammer down on the long pedal over and over again — a desire I was happy to oblige during a recent test on Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, Calif.\n\nA valve-operated exhaust system has much-appreciated mild to wild modes, allowing you to deafen passengers while barreling through a tunnel, then sneak back into your neighborhood undetected. In full-bore mode, the GT350’s exhaust might be the loudest exhaust system I’ve heard on a factory car.\n\nLet’s revisit that 8,250 rpm redline. It’s insane to wind out a bone-stock, factory V-8 in a Mustang to those kinds of speeds and not feel like the connecting rods are going to blast out of the engine block. The unique flat-plane crankshaft is responsible for the high engine speeds and the quickness of the revs; it gave Ford engineers the ability to open up the cylinder head, intake and camshaft to unleash more power, and it’s the crankshaft configuration that gives the GT350 such a unique exhaust sound.\n\nThe practicality of an 8,250 rpm engine is best experienced on the track, where the GT350 can stretch its legs between corners without having to upshift. When you do have to upshift, a new transmission designed to match the high rpm characteristics of the 5.2-liter allows lightning-quick shifting with a light but precise shifter and clutch pedal.\n\nThere’s a lot of room in the span of 8,000 rpm for an engine to be down on power and torque, but the 5.2-liter’s well-distributed torque above 3,500 rpm — and peak of 429 pounds-feet at 4,750 rpm — means the engine is punchy and can still pull out of its way at lower engine speeds, up to maximum power at 7,500 rpm. Some rev-happy engines aren’t happy off the track, but the 5.2-liter is wholeheartedly entertaining on canyon roads and even in straight-line bursts of acceleration. An added bonus is that the engine maintains decent power past redline, though below 3,500 rpm you really do have to be in the right gear. Don’t even try to pass in 6th; it just won’t work.\n\nYou won’t find levels of acceleration here that pin you to the back of your seat, like in the 662-hp 2014 Shelby GT500 or the 707-hp 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. No, the GT350 is more focused on delivering balance and precision despite having 91 more horsepower than the 5.0-liter Mustang GT.\n\nThe stiffness of the chassis, responsiveness and feedback of the steering, and the car’s overall composure are more reminiscent of a BMW M4 than a Mustang. Ford went through the Mustang’s chassis and replaced numerous bearings with more rigid pieces. It also redesigned the front steering knuckle to be stiffer and lighter, widened the front track and thickened the anti-roll bars. Add in the Brembo-brand six-piston front brakes and four-piston rears, which replace the wimpy single-piston rears on the GT, and the GT350 has all the goods you’d expect in a track-specific model. Perhaps the best thing going for the Mustang in comparison with the M4 is that the GT350’s exhaust doesn’t sound like a weed whacker.\n\nMagneRide is the hot, new suspension setup that makes the GT350 such a performer. The optional system popularized by General Motors and now employed by many automakers uses iron-impregnated fluid passing through electro-magnetic fields to continually adjust damper performance for road conditions. Base GT350s use a fixed-firmness suspension, while MagneRide is optional as part of the Track and Tech packages.\n\nMagneRide is adjustable using what Ford calls integrated driver control. The system features Normal, Sport, Weather, Track and Drag driving modes that tailor MagneRide’s responsiveness and firmness — along with exhaust modes, engine responsiveness, steering firmness, electronic stability and traction settings — for specific driving styles. The GT350R gets its own unique MagneRide tuning.\n\nThere’s not a huge range of road comfort separation between the driving modes, however. The base mode is called Normal, not Comfort, for good reason. The GT350 exhibits noticeable noise and taut composure on the road even in the softest mode. But I think that works. Like the M4, the GT350’s slightly disruptive ride is a constant reminder that you’re driving something special, even if it means an uncomfortable jolt every once in a while.\n\nI found the GT350 surprisingly easy to drive on the track. When things did start to get a little hairy — more likely from me getting off line than a characteristic of the car — the GT350 provided plenty of notice through a slight chatter in the front tires, indicating I should back off the accelerator and get the nose back in line. At no point did I think the rear end was going to whip out unprovoked. Every handling characteristic of the new Mustang GT with independent rear suspension is heightened, sharper and quicker in the GT350, which makes for a supremely confident handling machine. Even with the GT’s optional Performance Package, there’s still a fair amount of body roll while cornering, which is where the GT350 comes in with superior levels of body motion control. Compare the GT350 with the GT here.\n\nOf course, there’s good, and then there’s GT350R good. The R model carries significantly more cornering speed, with higher levels of grip from the wider, stickier tires and giant downforce-generating wing. Between corners at Laguna Seca, where the GT350 could ride out 3rd gear to the braking zone, the GT350R got off the corners with such speed that I could grab 4th gear in the same straight.\n\nIn Track mode, the stability system didn’t stick its nose in my business on the track, which is appreciated compared with some overactive sport modes — like the M4’s. Being a driver of intermediate skill, I prefer to keep the car in a mode with a safety net while learning a new track, which I was doing at Laguna Seca. Track mode’s stability and traction settings allow the car to slide a little, but keep a safety net in place to avoid spinning out. It didn’t hold the car back.\n\nInterior\n\nFord went back to the drawing board for the Recaro-brand seats that are standard in the GT350. The Mustang GT’s optional Recaro seats are sporty but not different enough from the standard seats to really be considered track seats. That’s all changed with the GT350’s seats, which are firmer with more pronounced side bolstering. Plus, the cloth-only construction keeps your butt planted more than in the GT Recaros’ slippery optional leather. The Technology Package replaces the Recaros with heated and ventilated leather seats.\n\nKeeping with the track-ready theme, a new shift light uses a head-up display and a string of LEDs to show how close the engine is to redline. It’s especially important in this car, because the high-revving 5.2-liter is so unique it’s easy to short shift (despite having a few hundred rpm to go) if you judge purely by sound. Independently adjustable from the driving modes, Tach, Track and Drag shift light modes display the lights differently, and I preferred Drag mode even on the road course because it simply flashes when it’s time to shift, as opposed to constantly having distracting LEDs dancing on the windshield with engine rpm.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe GT350’s standard multimedia system is nothing flashy or fancy. It uses the small screen from the base Mustang and has dual USB inputs, a CD player and an AM/FM radio. The small screen is surrounded by a sea of buttons, so it takes a lot of familiarity to know where everything is placed.\n\nI was unable to sample the optional multimedia system with Ford’s latest Sync 3 and 8-inch touch-screen. We’ll try to get our hands on that system in the future. Sync 3 is available only on the Tech Package ($7,500); it’s not a feature you can get with the Track Package.\n\nI’d like to see the aforementioned driving modes (Normal, Sport, Weather, Track and Drag) streamlined into more easily operated controls. The steering-wheel-button location is nice, but you have to scroll through the modes to select. Ford could take a lesson from BMW’s M cars, which have programmable buttons on the steering wheel for preset driving modes, so changing modes is as easy as hitting one button.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe GT350 retains the 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space and 50/50-split folding backseat of the base GT. The GT350R’s backseat is removed for weight savings and all that’s left is a molded insert where the backseat used to be; the insert doesn’t fold.\n\nSafety\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Mustang coupe an overall five-star crash-test rating, out of five stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested it. Like the regular Mustang, the GT350 and GT350R include a driver’s knee airbag, side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags.\n\nA forward collision warning system and a blind spot warning system that are optional on the GT Premium Mustang are not offered on the GT350 or GT350R. A backup camera is standard on the GT350 but is deleted from the GT350R; adding it back again requires the $3,000 Electronics Package.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Mustang GT350 and GT350R have the defined purpose of being corner-hugging thoroughbreds (what would a Mustang review be without an equestrian reference?). There’s an indisputable difference between the GT350 and the base Mustang GT that, for some, may make it an easy decision to fork out $50,000-plus for the GT350.\n\nThe GT350 starts at $48,695 (all prices include a destination fee), but that’s not the car you want. You want the $6,500 Track Package, which boosts the car to $55,195. That price doesn’t include the $1,300 gas-guzzler tax the GT350 is saddled with because it’s rated only 14/21/16 mpg city/highway/combined. Nor does it include the dealer markup that will surely be tacked onto this hotly desirable, limited-production car. A Ford Performance spokesman said GT350 production will be determined by demand, and Ford expects production numbers similar to the GT500 of recent years. The GT350R, however, will be much more rare, like the former Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca edition.\n\nGT350s with the aforementioned Track Package include all the bits and pieces you need to complete a track day worry-free. On the technology side, the Technology Package ($7,500) includes some of the Track Package’s features, but not all of them. Tech cars add navigation, Sync 3, the large multimedia screen, dual-zone climate control, leather seats that are powered, heated and ventilated, plus more.\n\nYou don’t get the Recaro seats or oil coolers with the Technology Package, while Track Package cars are stuck with the small media display and no Sync 3. It’s a bummer, really, that you can’t get Sync 3 and navigation with the Recaro seats and auxiliary oil coolers on the GT350 unless you step up to the GT350R with the Electronics Package, and that’s a $66,495 car. The Track Package is already a little heavier than a base Mustang GT, so why not let in a few extra pounds for buyers who want all the track goods as well as a modern multimedia system?\n\nIs it worth it? If you take this car to track days, the answer is a solid yes, as you’ll get one of the most unique and purpose-built Mustangs Ford has rolled off the assembly line in a long time. Even if you drive the GT350 only on the street, the beastly sound that emanates from the tailpipes during 8,250 rpm blasts will make you forget about the high price tag, if only momentarily.",
