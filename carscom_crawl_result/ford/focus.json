      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nUntil last year the compact Ford Focus had been sold in the U.S. since 2000 with no significant redesigns, but then it was fully re-engineered and redesigned and now shares its foundation— not just its name — with Focus models sold overseas. With this change comes a substantial quality improvement. Sedan and hatchback body styles are offered and the five-seat Focus competes in a crowded class that includes the Chevrolet Cruze, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda3, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla.\nNew for 2013\nA manual transmission is newly available for the Focus’ top-of-the-line Titanium trim level and the high-performance turbocharged Focus ST hatchback joins the lineup.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Focus ST)\nExterior\nThe Focus is an exceptionally stylish vehicle in this historically conservative class. It offers body-colored door handles and side mirrors with integrated turn signals. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 15-inch steel rims\nOptional 17- and 18-inch wheels\nOptional rear spoiler\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe Focus’ interior size compares to the Civic and Corolla, with less backseat room than the Cruze. The Focus’ interior quality is notably higher than its predecessor, with standard cloth and, in higher trim levels, optional leather upholstery. Heated front seats are also optional.\n\nA one-piece folding bench backseat is standard, and a 60/40-split version is optional. The sedan’s trunk measures 13.2 cubic feet. The hatchback offers 23.8 cubic feet behind the backseat and a total of 44.8 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded flat. Interior features include:\n\n\nOptional remote start\nOptional backup camera\nOptional MyFord Touch and Sync multimedia system\nOptional park assist\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Focus is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic, which uses a fast-acting dual-clutch design. (It has no clutch pedal and operates as an automatic from the driver’s perspective.)\n\nThe Focus is rated as high as 38 mpg on the highway with the automatic and 36 mpg with the manual. The best efficiency comes with the Super Fuel Economy Package, which delivers 40 mpg highway with the automatic.\n\nThe Focus offers two suspension tunings, tied to wheel size. The base covers all wheel sizes from 15 to 17 inches. The Titanium’s optional 18-inchers come with a firmer, sportier suspension. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 160 horsepower\nEngine runs on regular gas\nFront-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nThe Focus marks the debut of new airbag technology that Ford says will better protect against chest and rib injuries. Both the shape and a new variable venting feature attempt to tailor airbag deployment to suit the occupant’s position. Additional safety features include:\n\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\n\nFocus ST\nEver since the North American and European Focus coalesced into the same uniform model for 2012, American sport enthusiasts have been anticipating a replacement for the SVT version, the high-performance Focus model that was killed nearly a decade ago.\n\nThe faithful can get what they wanted for 2013 as Ford adds the high-performance Focus ST. It’s powered by a 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 270 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed manual is the only available transmission.\n\nAdditional mechanical changes include a reworked suspension with upgraded shock absorbers and springs. Overall, the sport-tuned suspension offers less ground clearance but better cornering abilities, Ford says.\n\nThe electronic stability system and Torque Vectoring Control programming have been revised in the ST, too. The stability system has three modes to choose from, including an intermediate “reduced or wide-slip mode,” which turns traction control off and intrudes only when absolutely necessary. Torque Vectoring Control aims to reduce understeer.\n\nBesides all the technical upgrades, the ST also shows off its more aggressive nature inside and out with 18-inch alloy wheels, a honeycomb front grille and available Recaro-brand sport seats.

      "expert_review": "A freshened look, quieter ride and unique new powertrain keep the 2015 Ford Focus competitive in the compact class, but a cramped interior and dated multimedia system keep it from earning top marks.\n\nFord’s compact Focus is one of the best-selling cars in the world, sold on nearly every continent in almost the same form these days thanks to the company’s globalization efforts. For us in North America, that means the same slick handling, high build quality and excellent interior materials that have always been on the European-market model now appear on our domestic one, as well. (This wasn’t the case in the U.S. Focus’ early generations.)\n\nFor 2015, Ford has made some mild updates to the Focus model-year lineup, both cosmetically and mechanically (compare 2014 and 2015 models here). Ford says the new Focus has a new optional engine, new suspension tuning and more sound insulation for a quieter experience. The last Ford Focus we tested wasn’t a favorite of ours due to the behavior of its dual-clutch automatic transmission. Has the new model righted those flaws in an otherwise pleasant compact car?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe latest Ford Focus has been a winner in the styling department in both hatchback and sedan forms. The update for 2015 improves on that, but the changes are subtle. The headlights and taillights have been revised to have a more horizontal orientation, ostensibly to give the car a wider look. What it does most successfully is mimic the larger Fusion sedan, to the point that many people confused the Focus sedan I tested for a new Fusion. With both the 17- and 18-inch wheels on the three test models I drove over the course of a week, the car looked sporty, vaguely European and attractive in both body styles.\n\nHow It Drives\nI sampled three Ford Focus versions — the SE with a 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder and six-speed manual transmission, and two loaded Titanium models with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine — one with a five-speed manual transmission, the other with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Focus comes standard with a 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nDespite the fairly high horsepower number, the four-cylinder feels poky and sedate, even when rowing through the manual transmission’s accurate stick-shift gates with aggressive intent. The reason it feels slow becomes apparent when you step into a car equipped with the dual-clutch automatic transmission. That transmission revs the hell out of the engine even under light acceleration, keeping the engine in its powerband and providing a considerably more peppy experience. It doesn’t feel as sporty or quick as a Mazda3 or Kia Forte, but it is an improvement over the the manual transmission model, and the PowerShift dual-clutch automatic’s new tuning has all but eliminated the weird shifting behavior we so despised in the 2013 Focus we tested. It almost feels like a normal automatic transmission now — at least enough that the complaints that plagued the last one should be largely absent now.\n\nThe most surprising model, and the one I would personally choose, is the Ford Focus SE with the new 123-hp, turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder with a six-speed manual transmission. That transmission is an extra-cost option in the SE model only and is meant to boost fuel economy. While it’s down 37 hp versus the base 2.0-liter engine, it feels stronger thanks to its turbocharger. It pulls strongly in just about any situation, accompanied by a throaty growl that’s unique to engines with odd numbers of cylinders. The six-speed manual is precise and light, and combined with an equally pleasant clutch pedal, it makes for a car that’s a lot of fun to drive.\n\nUnfortunately, that engine is available only with a manual transmission, which seems a bizarre decision given how unpopular those are in America. Ford says it’s first evaluating interest in the three-cylinder engine before bringing an automatic to market here. We suspect it’s more likely a matter of tuning (Ford probably thought the low-powered engine combined with the funky-shifting dual-clutch automatic wouldn’t feel right to American consumers, and it would have a point).\n\nRegardless of engine, the new Ford Focus updates have created a solid, quiet car to drive. Thicker front door glass and additional insulation make the car extremely quiet on the highway, with the only quirk coming from the all-season tires on Titanium models. They create a whining drone on asphalt at any speed above 40 mph — loud enough to wonder if there’s something wrong with how they’re wearing.\n\nThe brakes are strong and progressive; the steering is direct and has good feedback through a meaty steering wheel, and despite some fairly pronounced body roll through corners, the Ford Focus feels athletic and capable.\n\nFocus competitors are numerous, but we’ll talk about three of the more popular ones here. The Focus feels far more substantial than a Toyota Corolla, which feels cheap and tinny by comparison. And while appearing slightly more spacious thanks to its more upright dashboard, the Corolla — with its lazy steering, droning continuously variable automatic transmission and cushy ride — isn’t half the athlete the Focus is.\n\nThe Mazda3 can give the Focus a run for its money, however, with its spacious interior, knockout styling, competitive power and excellent fuel economy. Honda’s Civic also competes well, with even more space inside than the Focus and engines that feel more powerful. None of the Focus’ competitors have a dual-clutch transmission, however, aside from the Volkswagen Golf; many instead make use of CVTs.\n\nThe purpose of the Ford’s smallest engine and dual-clutch transmissions is fuel economy, and the Focus delivers on that front. In a few days with the 1.0-liter, I achieved a surprising 40 mpg average in mixed use. The 2.0-liter Titanium models registered a combined 32 mpg. Officially, the 1.0-liter model is EPA-rated 29/40/33 mpg city/highway/combined, but that engine is also available in a more expensive SFE trim that boosts fuel economy to 30/42/35 mpg. The 2.0-liter’s mileage varies with its transmission: The five-speed manual car is rated 26/36/30 mpg, while the dual-clutch automatic comes in at 27/40/31 mpg. Unlike some previous Ford models, when driven conservatively the Focus trims can meet or beat their EPA ratings, I’ve found.\n\nThe most fuel-efficient Toyota Corolla is the LE Eco, which features a CVT and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. It rings in at 30/42/35 mpg in its LE Eco base form, but higher Eco Plus and Eco Premium trim models are rated at 30/40/34 mpg, still besting every Focus but the SFE 1.0-liter. The most fuel-efficient Mazda3 is the sedan with a 2.0-liter engine and automatic transmission, which is rated 30/41/34 mpg. Interestingly, the base Honda Civic, with a 1.8-liter engine and five-speed manual transmission, is not the most fuel-efficient Civic, coming in at 28/36/31 mpg. The CVT-equipped version achieves 30/39/33 mpg, while a more expensive HF trim gets 31/41/35 mpg with a CVT. The fuel economy champ, however, is the Civic Hybrid, with a rating of 44/47/45 mpg from its gasoline-electric powertrain.\n\nInterior\nFord used some high-quality materials in the latest Focus. A few nods to regionalism have also produced some improvements, such as relocating the lock switches to the doors instead of having them centrally located on the dash. The seats still feel too short — a common problem in new Fords — and when the numbers are stacked up, the Focus has the tightest interior of the competitive set. Front and especially rear legroom are tight, with the Focus coming in a stunning 8.2 inches less than the Corolla’s maximum rear legroom. Visibility is acceptable but not great, thanks to thick pillars around all the Focus’ windows, which also serve to widen the car’s blind spots front and rear.\n\nThe real surprise is how nice the SE trim level is, with all the same high-quality materials of the Titanium model except the leather-trimmed seats, which don’t impress anyway in terms of feel or scent. The Titanium may have more electronic safety systems and a larger touch-screen for Ford Sync and navigation, but driving the SE and Titanium back-to-back, I was hard-pressed to justify the Titanium’s nearly $10,000 higher price, as tested. You don’t need to spend Titanium money to get a perfectly nice, quiet, comfortable Focus.\n\nThe Focus blows away the latest Corolla despite the Toyota’s newfound embrace of color in its interiors (no more greige!). The Corolla’s seats feel flatter but larger, and there’s no denying its space advantage, but it’s noisy compared with the Focus, with a CVT that still doesn’t sound like it’s having a good time under acceleration. The Civic is due for a refresh of its quirky, split-level dashboard, which has more critics than friends among reviewers. It, too, has flat seats, but its rear passenger compartment also has a unique flat floor, allowing for more comfortable three-across seating. The nicest interior award goes to the Mazda3, especially in its latest incarnation, which features excellent leather trim, splashes of color and material quality that easily matches the Focus.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWe’ve written more than enough on MyFord Touch; our feelings regarding its utility and troublesome user-friendliness are well-established. Suffice it to say we’re looking forward to Sync3, which is expected to arrive in 2016. First indications are that it will be significantly more pleasant to use.\n\nSomething we don’t often get to test, though, is the base model’s audio control system and multimedia interface, which came in our SE EcoBoost test car. It sounds quite good (Ford does base stereos well), but the controls are still confusing; it’s operated via a plethora of buttons and a small display screen high in the dash. Syncing a smartphone still takes some doing, and plugging in a music device can cause anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes or more of “indexing” as the car learns about all your musical selections.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Ford Focus may not be the biggest car in its category in terms of passenger room, but it stacks up well in cargo capacity in both sedan and hatchback forms. The sedan offers a 13.2-cubic-foot trunk with fold-down rear seats, while the hatchback has 23.8 cubic feet, expandable to 44.8 cubic feet with the backseat folded.\n\nOf its sedan competitors, the Corolla offers 13.0 cubic feet, the Civic has 12.5 cubic feet and the Mazda3 comes with 12.4 cubic feet. The hatchback styles offer considerably more overall room than the sedans, but the Focus beats them all in behind-the-seats cargo room. Still, while the Volkswagen Golf has 22.8 cubic feet to the Focus’ 23.8, the Golf’s more spacious passenger compartment means it’s expandable to 52.7 cubic feet of room. The Kia Forte is also available as a hatchback, with 23.2 cubic feet of cargo room (total cargo room stats are not available for the Forte5).\n\nSafety\nThe Ford Focus received a five-star safety rating out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in all categories except rollover protection, in which it scored four stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Focus a Top Safety Pick rating, as it scored good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in all crash tests except the small overlap front test, in which it scored acceptable. See the Focus’ crash test results here.\n\nAs for safety systems, the Focus has some of the most advanced features in its class, with optional items like lane keeping assist, hands-free parallel and perpendicular parking, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. A backup camera is standard.\n\nSee all the Ford Focus’ standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe redesigned 2015 Ford Focus runs a range of prices and equipment, but it’s neither the least nor most expensive compact on the market. Base price starts at $17,995 for an S sedan, but that car is short on creature comforts and standard equipment (hand-crank rear windows, anyone?).\n\nOne of the cars I drove was an EcoBoost-equipped SE model, which was decently equipped at $21,035, including the six-speed manual transmission; the turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine; a body kit; 17-inch aluminum wheels; and a reverse sensing system. By contrast, the white Titanium sedan I tested came in considerably higher, at $27,200, with the standard 2.0-liter engine, an automatic transmission, leather seats, navigation and Sync system, active park assist, lane keeping assist and 18-inch wheels.\n\nIt’s possible to option up a Ford Focus Titanium to nearly $30,000, but having sampled one so-equipped, I can state that the 1.0-liter SE EcoBoost is so good that spending an additional 10 grand on the Focus for more equipment simply isn’t worth your money.\n\nThere are tons of Focus competitors, given the compact class is the largest, best-selling vehicle category in the world. Here in the U.S., the Toyota Corolla is a perennial best-seller, with buyers favoring its reputation for reliability and value over its rather lackluster driving experience and mediocre cabin materials.\n\nThe Honda Civic feels like a more substantial vehicle than the Corolla, but its quirky interior styling puts some people off. It has some different powertrain options, however, including a full hybrid system and a natural-gas-powered version.\n\nPerhaps the most entertaining option is the Mazda3, which for 2015 gets an upgraded interior to match its sporty ride and handling. Yet the Mazda falls short in terms of electronic sophistication, with a multimedia system that still needs some work. Compare the Focus with these competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2015 about the 2015 Ford Focus. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA freshened look, quieter ride and unique new powertrain keep the 2015 Ford Focus competitive in the compact class, but a cramped interior and dated multimedia system keep it from earning top marks.\n\nFord’s compact Focus is one of the best-selling cars in the world, sold on nearly every continent in almost the same form these days thanks to the company’s globalization efforts. For us in North America, that means the same slick handling, high build quality and excellent interior materials that have always been on the European-market model now appear on our domestic one, as well. (This wasn’t the case in the U.S. Focus’ early generations.)\n\nFor 2015, Ford has made some mild updates to the Focus lineup, both cosmetically and mechanically (compare 2014 and 2015 models here). Ford says the new Focus has a new optional engine, new suspension tuning and more sound insulation for a quieter experience. The last Focus we tested wasn’t a favorite of ours due to the behavior of its dual-clutch automatic transmission. Has the new model righted those flaws in an otherwise pleasant compact car?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe latest Focus has been a winner in the styling department in both hatchback and sedan forms. The update for 2015 improves on that, but the changes are subtle. The headlights and taillights have been revised to have a more horizontal orientation, ostensibly to give the car a wider look. What it does most successfully is mimic the larger Fusion sedan, to the point that many people confused the Focus sedan I tested for a new Fusion. With both the 17- and 18-inch wheels on the three test models I drove over the course of a week, the car looked sporty, vaguely European and attractive in both body styles.\n\nHow It Drives\nI sampled three Focus versions — the SE with a 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder and six-speed manual transmission, and two loaded Titanium models with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine — one with a five-speed manual transmission, the other with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Focus comes standard with a 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nDespite the fairly high horsepower number, the four-cylinder feels poky and sedate, even when rowing through the manual transmission’s accurate stick-shift gates with aggressive intent. The reason it feels slow becomes apparent when you step into a car equipped with the dual-clutch automatic transmission. That transmission revs the hell out of the engine even under light acceleration, keeping the engine in its powerband and providing a considerably more peppy experience. It doesn’t feel as sporty or quick as a Mazda3 or Kia Forte, but it is an improvement over the the manual transmission model, and the PowerShift dual-clutch automatic’s new tuning has all but eliminated the weird shifting behavior we so despised in the 2013 Focus we tested. It almost feels like a normal automatic transmission now — at least enough that the complaints that plagued the last one should be largely absent now.\n\nThe most surprising model, and the one I would personally choose, is the SE with the new 123-hp, turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder with a six-speed manual transmission. That transmission is an extra-cost option in the SE model only and is meant to boost fuel economy. While it’s down 37 hp versus the base 2.0-liter engine, it feels stronger thanks to its turbocharger. It pulls strongly in just about any situation, accompanied by a throaty growl that’s unique to engines with odd numbers of cylinders. The six-speed manual is precise and light, and combined with an equally pleasant clutch pedal, it makes for a car that’s a lot of fun to drive.\n\nUnfortunately, that engine is available only with a manual transmission, which seems a bizarre decision given how unpopular those are in America. Ford says it’s first evaluating interest in the three-cylinder engine before bringing an automatic to market here. We suspect it’s more likely a matter of tuning (Ford probably thought the low-powered engine combined with the funky-shifting dual-clutch automatic wouldn’t feel right to American consumers, and it would have a point).\n\nRegardless of engine, the new Focus updates have created a solid, quiet car to drive. Thicker front door glass and additional insulation make the car extremely quiet on the highway, with the only quirk coming from the all-season tires on Titanium models. They create a whining drone on asphalt at any speed above 40 mph — loud enough to wonder if there’s something wrong with how they’re wearing.\n\nThe brakes are strong and progressive; the steering is direct and has good feedback through a meaty steering wheel, and despite some fairly pronounced body roll through corners, the Focus feels athletic and capable.\n\nFocus competitors are numerous, but we’ll talk about three of the more popular ones here. The Focus feels far more substantial than a Toyota Corolla, which feels cheap and tinny by comparison. And while appearing slightly more spacious thanks to its more upright dashboard, the Corolla — with its lazy steering, droning continuously variable automatic transmission and cushy ride — isn’t half the athlete the Focus is.\n\nThe Mazda3 can give the Focus a run for its money, however, with its spacious interior, knockout styling, competitive power and excellent fuel economy. Honda’s Civic also competes well, with even more space inside than the Focus and engines that feel more powerful. None of the Focus’ competitors have a dual-clutch transmission, however, aside from the Volkswagen Golf; many instead make use of CVTs.\n\nThe purpose of the Ford’s smallest engine and dual-clutch transmissions is fuel economy, and the Focus delivers on that front. In a few days with the 1.0-liter, I achieved a surprising 40 mpg average in mixed use. The 2.0-liter Titanium models registered a combined 32 mpg. Officially, the 1.0-liter model is EPA-rated 29/40/33 mpg city/highway/combined, but that engine is also available in a more expensive SFE trim that boosts fuel economy to 30/42/35 mpg. The 2.0-liter’s mileage varies with its transmission: The five-speed manual car is rated 26/36/30 mpg, while the dual-clutch automatic comes in at 27/40/31 mpg. Unlike some previous Ford models, when driven conservatively the Focus trims can meet or beat their EPA ratings, I’ve found.\n\nThe most fuel-efficient Toyota Corolla is the LE Eco, which features a CVT and a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. It rings in at 30/42/35 mpg in its LE Eco base form, but higher Eco Plus and Eco Premium trim models are rated at 30/40/34 mpg, still besting every Focus but the SFE 1.0-liter. The most fuel-efficient Mazda3 is the sedan with a 2.0-liter engine and automatic transmission, which is rated 30/41/34 mpg. Interestingly, the base Honda Civic, with a 1.8-liter engine and five-speed manual transmission, is not the most fuel-efficient Civic, coming in at 28/36/31 mpg. The CVT-equipped version achieves 30/39/33 mpg, while a more expensive HF trim gets 31/41/35 mpg with a CVT. The fuel economy champ, however, is the Civic Hybrid, with a rating of 44/47/45 mpg from its gasoline-electric powertrain.\n\nInterior\nFord used some high-quality materials in the latest Focus. A few nods to regionalism have also produced some improvements, such as relocating the lock switches to the doors instead of having them centrally located on the dash. The seats still feel too short — a common problem in new Fords — and when the numbers are stacked up, the Focus has the tightest interior of the competitive set. Front and especially rear legroom are tight, with the Focus coming in a stunning 8.2 inches less than the Corolla’s maximum rear legroom. Visibility is acceptable but not great, thanks to thick pillars around all the Focus’ windows, which also serve to widen the car’s blind spots front and rear.\n\nThe real surprise is how nice the SE trim level is, with all the same high-quality materials of the Titanium model except the leather-trimmed seats, which don’t impress anyway in terms of feel or scent. The Titanium may have more electronic safety systems and a larger touch-screen for Ford Sync and navigation, but driving the SE and Titanium back-to-back, I was hard-pressed to justify the Titanium’s nearly $10,000 higher price, as tested. You don’t need to spend Titanium money to get a perfectly nice, quiet, comfortable Focus.\n\nThe Focus blows away the latest Corolla despite the Toyota’s newfound embrace of color in its interiors (no more greige!). The Corolla’s seats feel flatter but larger, and there’s no denying its space advantage, but it’s noisy compared with the Focus, with a CVT that still doesn’t sound like it’s having a good time under acceleration. The Civic is due for a refresh of its quirky, split-level dashboard, which has more critics than friends among reviewers. It, too, has flat seats, but its rear passenger compartment also has a unique flat floor, allowing for more comfortable three-across seating. The nicest interior award goes to the Mazda3, especially in its latest incarnation, which features excellent leather trim, splashes of color and material quality that easily matches the Focus.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWe’ve written more than enough on MyFord Touch; our feelings regarding its utility and troublesome user-friendliness are well-established. Suffice it to say we’re looking forward to Sync3, which is expected to arrive in 2016. First indications are that it will be significantly more pleasant to use.\n\nSomething we don’t often get to test, though, is the base model’s audio control system and multimedia interface, which came in our SE EcoBoost test car. It sounds quite good (Ford does base stereos well), but the controls are still confusing; it’s operated via a plethora of buttons and a small display screen high in the dash. Syncing a smartphone still takes some doing, and plugging in a music device can cause anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes or more of “indexing” as the car learns about all your musical selections.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Focus may not be the biggest car in its category in terms of passenger room, but it stacks up well in cargo capacity in both sedan and hatchback forms. The sedan offers a 13.2-cubic-foot trunk with fold-down rear seats, while the hatchback has 23.8 cubic feet, expandable to 44.8 cubic feet with the backseat folded.\n\nOf its sedan competitors, the Corolla offers 13.0 cubic feet, the Civic has 12.5 cubic feet and the Mazda3 comes with 12.4 cubic feet. The hatchback styles offer considerably more overall room than the sedans, but the Focus beats them all in behind-the-seats cargo room. Still, while the Volkswagen Golf has 22.8 cubic feet to the Focus’ 23.8, the Golf’s more spacious passenger compartment means it’s expandable to 52.7 cubic feet of room. The Kia Forte is also available as a hatchback, with 23.2 cubic feet of cargo room (total cargo room stats are not available for the Forte5).\n\nSafety\nThe Focus received a five-star safety rating out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in all categories except rollover protection, in which it scored four stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Focus a Top Safety Pick rating, as it scored good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in all crash tests except the small overlap front test, in which it scored acceptable. See the Focus’ crash test results here.\n\nAs for safety systems, the Focus has some of the most advanced features in its class, with optional items like lane keeping assist, hands-free parallel and perpendicular parking, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. A backup camera is standard.\n\nSee all the Focus’ standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe redesigned 2015 Ford Focus runs a range of prices and equipment, but it’s neither the least nor most expensive compact on the market. It starts at $17,995 for an S sedan, but that car is short on creature comforts and standard equipment (hand-crank rear windows, anyone?).\n\nOne of the cars I drove was an EcoBoost-equipped SE model, which was decently equipped at $21,035, including the six-speed manual transmission; the turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine; a body kit; 17-inch aluminum wheels; and a reverse sensing system. By contrast, the white Titanium sedan I tested came in considerably higher, at $27,200, with the standard 2.0-liter engine, an automatic transmission, leather seats, navigation and Sync system, active park assist, lane keeping assist and 18-inch wheels.\n\nIt’s possible to option up a Focus Titanium to nearly $30,000, but having sampled one so-equipped, I can state that the 1.0-liter SE EcoBoost is so good that spending an additional 10 grand on the Focus for more equipment simply isn’t worth your money. Option up a Focus your way here.\n\nThere are tons of Focus competitors, given the compact class is the largest, best-selling vehicle category in the world. Here in the U.S., the Toyota Corolla is a perennial best-seller, with buyers favoring its reputation for reliability and value over its rather lackluster driving experience and mediocre cabin materials.\n\nThe Honda Civic feels like a more substantial vehicle than the Corolla, but its quirky interior styling puts some people off. It has some different powertrain options, however, including a full hybrid system and a natural-gas-powered version.\n\nPerhaps the most entertaining option is the Mazda3, which for 2015 gets an upgraded interior to match its sporty ride and handling. Yet the Mazda falls short in terms of electronic sophistication, with a multimedia system that still needs some work. Compare the Focus with these competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2009 about the 2009 Ford Focus. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Ford Focus is one of those small cars that’s fun to drive even though it doesn’t have a high-horsepower engine. It gets good gas mileage, it has comfortable seats and its interior lighting looks great. So why can I only give it a partial thumbs-up? Despite the Focus’ positive traits, a number of issues drag down my overall opinion of this car.\n\nThe Focus is offered in sedan and coupe body styles, and my test car was a Focus SES coupe. The starting price of this model is $17,865 but with options the as-tested price came to $20,615. To see a side-by-side comparison of the 2008 and 2009 Focus, click here.\n\nA Look the Kids Will Love?\nThe Focus coupe received a number of styling changes for 2009 that Ford says were designed to attract “Millennial” buyers — people born between 1980 and 1995, using Ford’s definition. The changes include a large mesh lower grille, a gray two-bar grille and headlamps with black accents. If you choose an SES trim level like the one we tested, you also get a spoiler above the rear window and 17-inch aluminum wheels with a silver-gray finish Ford calls “dark chrome.”\n\nThe changes definitely distinguish the coupe from the sedan’s more traditional styling, but I’m not convinced they make the car any more attractive to younger buyers. The changes may actually be less appealing to some who’d rather do the customizing themselves.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe only engine offered in the Focus is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder: To the good, it moves the Focus quite well if you’re willing to rev it, and this isn’t a chore because it revs easily. Rated at 143 hp in the coupe (140 hp in the sedan), the engine gives you enough power to confidently merge onto the highway and pull out in front of traffic. It’s peppy enough to survive the increasingly aggressive driving public.\n\nGas mileage is competitive. Manual-transmission models are rated at 24/35 mpg city/highway while the optional four-speed automatic gets 24/33 mpg. There are a handful of models that get better automatic-transmission mileage — like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Kia Forte — but the Focus lags by only a few miles per gallon from the Civic’s class-leading mileage.\n\nWhat’s less appealing about the four-cylinder is that even though it revs smoothly, at higher rpm you can feel some vibration through the pedals, which is something I haven’t experienced in all of the cars I’ve tested. It’s not something you want to feel when driving a new car and it was a little annoying, though I did get used to it after driving the Focus for a while. Fortunately, you don’t feel any vibrations through the steering wheel.\n\nThe manual transmission is also something of a mixed bag, though the good outweighs the bad. The shifter is tall, which puts it within reach of your right hand, and it slips easily from gear to gear. What I didn’t really like is the bit of play in the shifter. The clutch pedal is light enough that it won’t turn your left leg to Jell-O in stop-and-go traffic, and it’s easy to work the clutch and gas pedals to accelerate smoothly from a stop.\n\nI initially thought the Focus’ brake pedal was a little soft, but I came to appreciate the amount of control I found beyond that initial softness. Once the pedal firms up, it lets you finely tune braking response with foot pressure.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Focus’ firm ride quality is common among small cars. You’ll feel bumps and cracks in the road, but the Focus isn’t quite as sensitive to them as a Civic.\n\nThe payoff for this firmer ride comes in the corners, where the Focus’ resistance to body roll encourages you to drive it quickly. It may not have the moves of a Mazda3, but it’s still willing to play a little when you encounter curves. It’s a nimble little car.\n\nOn the highway, the Focus is a comfortable cruiser. It feels stable, and that’s thanks in large part to the car’s steering. There’s no play in the wheel and the power-steering assistance isn’t excessive, which gives the wheel a heavier feel than a Mazda3’s wheel. There is a notable amount of wind noise in the coupe at 65 mph, though.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Focus received a new interior for the 2008 model year, and the design looks contemporary. The most distinctive element of the dash is its large swaths of silver trim, which is specific to SES models. I usually don’t find silver trim that appealing, but it looks nice in the Focus and is well integrated into the overall cabin design. However, there’s still too much shiny black plastic, especially on the doors. The plastic trim on the driver’s-side door grab was loose, too. I know this is an affordable compact car, but when you have models like the new Forte — which has lots of low-gloss, upscale-looking plastic in its cabin — it raises the bar for competitors like the Focus.\n\nFord paid particular attention to lighting; you’ll have to experience it when it’s dark to fully appreciate it. At night, the buttons for the audio and air-conditioning systems on the center control panel cut through the darkness with vibrant blue backlighting that’s also found on the gauges. Optional ambient lighting lets you switch among seven colors to illuminate the cupholders and footwells. This is one of those things that distinguish the Focus from its competition, but there are a few problems with the implementation of it.\n\nThe gauges are legible enough at night when the backlighting is on, but during the day the wide hash marks on the dials blend together, making it hard to know your exact speed at times. Also, as Cars.com Senior Editor Joe Wiesenfelder pointed out in his review of the 2010 Ford Fusion, the ambient lighting casts its glow from visible pencil-sized portholes located around the cabin. They’re not well concealed, so you don’t get the same soft glow in the Focus as you do in other, more expensive cars.\n\nThe Focus comes standard with cloth seats, but my test car had optional heated leather seats in black with white stitching. The seats are comfortable, but they don’t offer a lot of bolstering to keep you in place during hard cornering, and the seat heaters only have an on/off switch rather than the preferred low/high or graduated settings. My SES coupe had a height-adjustable driver’s seat; the overall driving position was decent, though it would have been better if there was a telescoping steering column (the Focus only has a tilt feature, which is odd because the previous generation offered a tilt/telescoping wheel). With the seat far enough back to comfortably work the pedals, I had to reach forward more than I like to hold the steering wheel.\n\nVisibility in the coupe is good when looking over your left or right shoulder before changing lanes, but I wasn’t as impressed with the view out the rear window when backing up. The rear window is large enough, but the driver’s-side C-pillar limits your visibility on that side of the car.\n\nThe coupe has a three-person backseat, just like the sedan. Judging from the outside, you might think the coupe’s backseat would hardly be usable, but that’s far from the case. I was surprised by the relatively comfortable seating position and the impressive amount of headroom. With a large fixed quarter window to peer out of, it’s not claustrophobic, either. However, there’s probably not enough legroom to go around for two tall people to sit behind each other.\n\nThe coupe’s trunk measures 13.8 cubic feet — the same as the Focus sedan. That’s more room than you’ll find in a Civic coupe (11.5 cubic feet) and approximately the size of a Chevrolet Cobalt coupe’s trunk. The trunk opening looks a little bit like a slot — not ideal — and part of our test car’s cargo area was occupied by a subwoofer. It’s included with the $795 Moon & Tune Value Package, which also adds a six-CD changer and a power moonroof.\n\nSafety\nThe Focus received a Good overall rating — the highest possible score — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset crash test. In the side-impact crash test, the coupe received a Good rating, while the sedan scored one notch below with an Acceptable rating.\n\nThe Focus comes standard with six airbags, including side curtain airbags, but antilock brakes — an important safety feature that’s becoming increasingly standard on small affordable cars like the Focus — is optional. It’s bundled together with an electronic stability system. For the 2010 model year, both of these features become standard. For additional safety feature information, visit the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nThe Verdict\nThe Focus is one of the better-selling compact cars, and it’s easy to see why car shoppers like it. It’s an adept commuter car that gets good gas mileage but is still willing to have a little fun in the corners if you want. The cabin is comfortable for both the driver and passengers and has an eye-catching design. If you can overlook the flaws I’ve mentioned, maybe you’ll be able to give it a full thumbs-up.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Focus is one of those small cars that’s fun to drive even though it doesn’t have a high-horsepower engine. It gets good gas mileage, it has comfortable seats and its interior lighting looks great. So why can I only give it a partial thumbs-up? Despite the Focus’ positive traits, a number of issues drag down my overall opinion of this car.\n\nThe Focus is offered in sedan and coupe body styles, and my test car was a Focus SES coupe. The starting price of this model is $17,865 but with options the as-tested price came to $20,615. To see a side-by-side comparison of the 2008 and 2009 Ford Focus, click here.\n\nA Look the Kids Will Love?\nThe Ford Focus coupe received a number of styling changes for 2009 that Ford says were designed to attract “Millennial” buyers — people born between 1980 and 1995, using Ford’s definition. The changes include a large mesh lower grille, a gray two-bar grille and headlamps with black accents. If you choose an SES trim level like the one we tested, you also get a spoiler above the rear window and 17-inch aluminum wheels with a silver-gray finish Ford calls “dark chrome.”\n\nThe changes definitely distinguish the coupe from the sedan’s more traditional styling, but I’m not convinced they make the car any more attractive to younger buyers. The changes may actually be less appealing to some who’d rather do the customizing themselves.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe only engine offered in the Ford Focus is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder: To the good, it moves the Focus quite well if you’re willing to rev it, and this isn’t a chore because it revs easily. Rated at 143 hp in the coupe (140 hp in the sedan), the engine gives you enough power to confidently merge onto the highway and pull out in front of traffic. It’s peppy enough to survive the increasingly aggressive driving public.\n\nGas mileage is competitive. Manual-transmission models are rated at 24/35 mpg city/highway while the optional four-speed automatic gets 24/33 mpg. There are a handful of models that get better automatic-transmission mileage — like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Kia Forte — but the Focus lags by only a few miles per gallon from the Civic’s class-leading mileage.\n\nWhat’s less appealing about the four-cylinder is that even though it revs smoothly, at higher rpm you can feel some vibration through the pedals, which is something I haven’t experienced in all of the cars I’ve tested. It’s not something you want to feel when driving a new vehicle and it was a little annoying, though I did get used to it after driving the Focus for a while. Fortunately, you don’t feel any vibrations through the steering wheel.\n\nThe manual transmission is also something of a mixed bag, though the good outweighs the bad. The shifter is tall, which puts it within reach of your right hand, and it slips easily from gear to gear. What I didn’t really like is the bit of play in the shifter. The clutch pedal is light enough that it won’t turn your left leg to Jell-O in stop-and-go traffic, and it’s easy to work the clutch and gas pedals to accelerate smoothly from a stop.\n\nI initially thought the Focus’ brake pedal was a little soft, but I came to appreciate the amount of control I found beyond that initial softness. Once the pedal firms up, it lets you finely tune braking response with foot pressure.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Ford Focus’ firm ride quality is common among small vehicles. You’ll feel bumps and cracks in the road, but the Focus isn’t quite as sensitive to them as a Civic.\n\nThe payoff for this firmer ride comes in the corners, where the Focus’ resistance to body roll encourages you to drive it quickly. It may not have the moves of a Mazda3, but it’s still willing to play a little when you encounter curves. It’s a nimble little car.\n\nOn the highway, the Focus is a comfortable cruiser. It feels stable, and that’s thanks in large part to the vehicle’s steering. There’s no play in the wheel and the power-steering assistance isn’t excessive, which gives the wheel a heavier feel than a Mazda3’s wheel. There is a notable amount of wind noise in the coupe at 65 mph, though.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Ford Focus received a new interior for the 2008 model year, and the design looks contemporary. The most distinctive element of the dash is its large swaths of silver trim, which is specific to SES models. I usually don’t find silver trim that appealing, but it looks nice in the Focus and is well integrated into the overall cabin design. However, there’s still too much shiny black plastic, especially on the doors. The plastic trim on the driver’s-side door grab was loose, too. I know this is an affordable compact car, but when you have models like the new Forte — which has lots of low-gloss, upscale-looking plastic in its cabin — it raises the bar for competitors like the Focus.\n\nFord paid particular attention to lighting; you’ll have to experience it when it’s dark to fully appreciate it. At night, the buttons for the audio and air-conditioning systems on the center control panel cut through the darkness with vibrant blue backlighting that’s also found on the gauges. Optional ambient lighting lets you switch among seven colors to illuminate the cupholders and footwells. This is one of those things that distinguish the Focus from its competition, but there are a few problems with the implementation of it.\n\nThe gauges are legible enough at night when the backlighting is on, but during the day the wide hash marks on the dials blend together, making it hard to know your exact speed at times. Also, as Cars.com Senior Editor Joe Wiesenfelder pointed out in his review of the 2010 Ford Fusion, the ambient lighting casts its glow from visible pencil-sized portholes located around the cabin. They’re not well concealed, so you don’t get the same soft glow in the Focus as you do in other, more expensive cars.\n\nThe Ford Focus comes standard with cloth seats, but my test car had optional heated leather seats in black with white stitching. The seats are comfortable, but they don’t offer a lot of bolstering to keep you in place during hard cornering, and the seat heaters only have an on/off switch rather than the preferred low/high or graduated settings. My SES coupe had a height-adjustable driver’s seat; the overall driving position was decent, though it would have been better if there was a telescoping steering column (the Focus only has a tilt feature, which is odd because the previous generation offered a tilt/telescoping wheel). With the seat far enough back to comfortably work the pedals, I had to reach forward more than I like to hold the steering wheel.\n\nVisibility in the coupe is good when looking over your left or right shoulder before changing lanes, but I wasn’t as impressed with the view out the rear window when backing up. The rear window is large enough, but the driver’s-side C-pillar limits your visibility on that side of the car.\n\nThe coupe has a three-person backseat, just like the sedan. Judging from the outside, you might think the coupe’s backseat would hardly be usable, but that’s far from the case. I was surprised by the relatively comfortable seating position and the impressive amount of headroom. With a large fixed quarter window to peer out of, it’s not claustrophobic, either. However, there’s probably not enough legroom to go around for two tall people to sit behind each other.\n\nThe coupe’s trunk measures 13.8 cubic feet — the same as the Focus sedan. That’s more room than you’ll find in a Civic coupe (11.5 cubic feet) and approximately the size of a Chevrolet Cobalt coupe’s trunk. The trunk opening looks a little bit like a slot — not ideal — and part of our test car’s cargo area was occupied by a subwoofer. It’s included with the $795 Moon & Tune Value Package, which also adds a six-CD changer and a power moonroof.\n\nSafety\nThe Ford Focus received a Good overall rating — the highest possible score — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset crash test. In the side-impact crash test, the coupe received a Good rating, while the sedan scored one notch below with an Acceptable rating.\n\nThe Ford Focus comes standard with six airbags, including side curtain airbags, but antilock brakes — an important safety feature that’s becoming increasingly standard on small affordable cars like the Focus — is optional. It’s bundled together with an electronic stability system. For the 2010 model year, both of these features become standard. For additional safety feature information, visit the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nThe Verdict\nThe Ford Focus is one of the better-selling compact cars, and it’s easy to see why car shoppers like it. It’s an adept commuter car that gets good gas mileage but is still willing to have a little fun in the corners if you want. The cabin is comfortable for both the driver and passengers and has an eye-catching design. If you can overlook the flaws I’ve mentioned, maybe you’ll be able to give it a full thumbs-up.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Focus ZX3 is a three-door hatchback dedicated to becoming the young grad’s first new car. And it certainly has everything it needs to accomplish that.\n\nIt’s cute, a whole lot of fun to drive, extremely roomy for a small car, and priced right. Given the fact that its modest starting sticker of $11,865 includes alloy wheels, a CD player, and the more powerful Focus engine, the ZX3 says high value as well as low price.\n\nThe idea, of course, is to bend the twig in the direction you want the tree to grow. Get those kids in the habit of buying Fords at an early age.\n\nBut that, I’m happy to report, doesn’t mean that older penniless people like me can’t have fun in a ZX3, too. This is really a car for people of any age whose appetite for driving kicks exceeds their ability to pay. Think of it as a starving motorhead’s BMW 3-Series.\n\nDesigned largely by Ford of Europe, the award-winning Focus debuted on the Continent, and then came to the United States for the 2000 model year. Available as a hatchback, wagon and sedan, the Focus is built on an all-new platform. The only substantive component borrowings are the pair of 2-liter, four-cylinder engines offered with the car: the 110-horsepower, eight-valve engine is from the Escort; the 130-horse, 16-valve four first saw the light of day in the Contour.\n\nThis new car is ingeniously designed. It is surprisingly strong for its weight (2,551 pounds), and exceptionally roomy for a small car. Indeed, it is the most spacious car in its class, a grouping that includes the Saturn S-Series, Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe Focus gets some of that extra interior volume from a relatively high roofline. That roofline, in turn, allows higher, more upright seating, which also permits more foot room under the front seats.\n\nEven after providing seating for five adults, the ZX3 hatchback still has big-car luggage space (18.5 cubic feet) behind the rear seat. Folding the rear seat roughly doubles the cargo area.\n\nAs useful as it is, the ZX3’s strong suit is the way it behaves itself. A car that starts under $12,000 shouldn’t perform this well.\n\nThanks to its strong structure and fully independent suspension, the ZX3 handles with aplomb, and furnishes a smoother ride than you would expect from an econocar. In fact, this little hatch rides better than some midsize sedans I’ve been in.\n\nIt’s the handling, though, that catches your fancy. The ZX3 is composed in the corners, and its relatively wide tires cling to the road tenaciously. Small cars usually have narrow tires with little grip. But with P195/60R15 radials mounted on its 15-inch wheels, the ZX3 tester had anything but.\n\nBecause it weighed less than 2,600 pounds, the 130-horse test car was lively business. I found myself changing gears more than I had to, simply because the shifter on the five-speed manual was such velvety fun.\n\nThe quick rack-and-pinion steering gear in this car also ra ises the fun quotient. This steering isn’t just very good in its class. It is superb by any standard, and may be Ford’s best yet. It isn’t every day you are treated to this kind of response and precision.\n\nWhile we are thanking the Focus structure for its contributions to the laudable ride and handling, we might also thank it for the low noise levels in the cabin.\n\nThe black body on the tester wasn’t beautiful (merely cute), but it was nicely assembled and finished. The interior was also well-screwed-together, and prettier than the exterior. The dash and door panels were finished with grained charcoal vinyl and graphite-colored metal – and looked more costly than they were.\n\nGas mileage was certainly presentable. The tester had EPA mileage ratings of 26 m.p.g. city and 33 highway. I obtained 29 in mixed driving.",

      "expert_review": "Sync is state-of-the-art voice-recognition technology, a fully integrated in-car communications and entertainment system for mobile phones and media players.\n\nFord is the only place to get the system so sophisticated that it hints vehicles will bow at consumer electronics confabs rather than auto shows.\n\nBesides accessing the old cell phone or MP3–by genre, album, artist or and song title–Sync also teams up with Bluetooth technology to call up names and numbers stored in your phone.\n\nSync can host nearly any media player, from the Apple iPod to MP3s with “plays for sure” technology to most USB storage drives.\n\nIt relays incoming text messages verbally; transfers a call from your cell to a Bluetooth phone in the car; and provides caller ID, call waiting and conference calling.\n\nIf overwhelmed by all the sophisticated electronics, simply utter “Play Elvis,” and the King will entertain.\n\nElvis must have left the building when we tested the system, however, because try as we might, the Microsoft designed Sync couldn’t find him in the 2008 Ford Focus. We would have gotten Sync in sync if granddaughter Haylie was available, but her 2nd-grade teacher wouldn’t let her call us from class.\n\nSync is standard on the redesigned 2008 Focus SES as well as high-end versions of the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers. It will be available on nearly all Ford, Lincoln and Mercury products–standard or as a $395 option–within two years.\n\nSync is to Ford as OnStar is to General Motors, a means of adapting high-tech electronics to your car. While OnStar unlocks doors, summons help if an airbag deploys and can find the car via satellite, Sync ensures you never have to miss a text message or your favorite tune. Why attach an earpiece to your melon or slip an iPod into your pocket, when you can simply wrap yourself in an automobile?\n\nWhile Sync is magical and mystical, the Focus it’s in is hardly the most technologically advanced vehicle in the Ford stable, much less in the industry.\n\nIn fairness, you have to remember that Ford has been bleeding money the last few years and hasn’t had the funds to remake its lineup as it would have liked.\n\nFocus is offered in S, SE and SES versions as a two-door coupe or four-door sedan. We tested the SES coupe.\n\nThis Focus represents a redesign of the current generation, not the next-generation world car that will be shared by Ford and its partners around the globe. Maybe that one will be able to summon Elvis.\n\nThe European Focus as well as the Volvo S40 sedan and Mazda3 share a small-car platform. The U.S. Focus will get with that program in a couple of years.\n\nThe old Focus leaned toward bland. The new one adopts the look of the mid-size Ford Fusion with its dual, aluminum-bar grille. It stands out rather than getting lost in a crowd like the Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla with which it competes.\n\nThe 2-liter, 136-horsepower 4- cylinder has been replaced by a 2-liter, 140-h.p. Duratec 4 with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. Fuel economy is 24 m.p.g. city/35 m.p.g. highway with manual, 24/33 with automatic.\n\nIt’s no speed merchant. Gets you going, keeps you going, but you’ll follow, not lead. Focus’s forte? Its membership in the 30 m.p.g. club.\n\nSuspension is strictly econocar, as well. The rougher the road, the rougher the ride. The car tends to swing a little wide in corners. Seats are flat, so you sit on them rather than sinking into them. Side bolsters are narrow with little lateral support.\n\nThe front seats slide forward to open a wide aisle to the rear, which offers surprisingly good head and arm room for two adults. Knee room, however, is at a premium.\n\nTrunk space is large, though the optional audiophile speakers take a major chunk out of luggage or grocery room. Rearseat backs fold, but not flat.\n\nThe SES coupe starts at $16,075 with air conditioning, AM/FM stereo and single-disc CD player and MP3 capability, side-curtain air bag, remote keyless entry, body-colored deck-lid spoiler, fog lamps, 16- inch radial tires and power windows/ locks/mirrors. No power seats.\n\nOptions included automatic transmission at $815, anti-lock brakes and traction control for $385, heated seats at $115, leather buckets at $695, Sirius satellite radio at $195, that audiophile sound-system upgrade with a six-disc CD changer and Sony speakers for $645 and ambient lighting for the front footwells that changes colors– green, red, yellow and a soothing silver blue–at the touch of a button for $295. It would be more soothing at $25.\n\nNo power moonroof on the tester, which would have added $625.\n\nA low-price, high-mileage commuter for those hooked on the lastest wonders in music and communication?without regard to tight cabin room and comfort, a sleepy 4-cylinder and an unforgiving suspension.\n\nFocus sales in the first nine months of this year totaled 145,977 units, down 4.1 percent, as some buyers awaited this redesigned version.\n\n– – –\n\n2008 FORD FOCUS SES\n\nPrice as tested: $19,220\n\nAdd $620 for freight\n\nWheelbase: 102.9 inches\n\nLength: 175.7 inches\n\nEngine: 2-liter, 140-h.p. 4 cylinder\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nMPG: 24 city/33 highway\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$16,075 Base\n\n$815 Automatic transmission\n\n$695 Leather bucket seats\n\n$645 Audiophile sound system with six-disc CD player and Sony speakers\n\n$385 ABS with traction control\n\n$295 Ambient lighting\n\n$195 Sirius satellite radio\n\n$115 Heated seats\n\nPLUSES\n\nRedesign that borrows aluminum-bar grille from Fusion.\n\nSide-curtain air bags standard.\n\nMore punch from 4.\n\nSync voice-activated communication system.\n\nMINUSES\n\nNew sheet metal for old platform.\n\nLearning the nuances of Sync.\n\n———-\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation.

      "expert_review": "Ford has significantly upped the ante in the compact-car segment with its redesigned 2012 Focus, which has taken a giant leap in terms of looks and quality.\n\nWhen test-driving the 2012 Focus hatchback, I felt like I had two personalities, “College Sara” and “Family Sara.” College Sara liked its updated, racy looks with its large grille and swoopy taillights, but it wasn’t quick enough from a stop. It was better suited for the more rational Family Sara, who liked its cargo space and ease with which the hatchback handled child-safety seats — something College Sara wouldn’t give a whit about.\n\nThe Focus has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that lacks some zip off the line. Once I got going, I didn’t feel like I was missing power. The Focus sticks to the road and seems to enjoy being pushed a bit. The steering was sporty, making turns and curves fun.\n\nSo, where did College Sara and Family Sara agree? In more places than one, but the most important thing was price. The Focus sedan has a starting MSRP of $16,500 and the hatchback comes in at $18,300. My test car, a Focus SEL hatchback, cost $24,720 and included the optional MyFord Touch and Cold Weather packages.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Focus’ angles and curves are in just the right spots, giving it a modern look, but it looks best from the rear. The curvy hatch and angled taillights are sporty and youthful. Optional 17-inch aluminum wheels help the Focus look more interesting than a regular commuter car, and even Family Sara likes that the Focus adds some visual excitement to the carpool lane.\n\nMy elementary-school-aged kids had no issues getting in and out of the Focus; the doors opened and closed easily and are lightweight. The cargo area was squared off due to a subwoofer that shaved off some of the space’s width. Parents who regularly haul strollers in their cars will want to make sure they fit in the Focus’ trunk.\n\nParents of teen drivers will like the Focus’ MyKey system. A programmable key allows parents to set limits on the car’s top speed — 65, 70, 75 or 80 mph — and the radio’s volume. It also mutes the radio and sounds a chime until the driver buckles up.\n\nThe Focus has a 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It uses unleaded gas and gets an EPA-estimated 28/38 mpg city/highway. This falls short of some competitors that get 40 mpg highway, but Ford offers the Focus SFE trim that hits 40 mpg highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some-Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile the Focus is inexpensive, it doesn’t feel cheap. The steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and the metallic accents have some heft to them. I wasn’t such a fan of the fabric upholstery — that’s personal though, I prefer leather interiors for ease in cleaning — but I must admit it was sturdy and comfortable.\n\nThe main complaint for both College and Family Sara is the interior’s lack of storage spaces. This is a hazard of a smaller car; in the front row I just had two cupholders, the center console and a glove box. I missed having a little bin for my phone or my wallet.\n\nMy test car had the MyFord Touch system; a touch-screen in the dash controls the stereo, climate and more. Of course, Family Sara worries about the distraction factor of these systems, while College Sara had lots of fun pushing the buttons and figuring out how to make it work.  In addition to MyFord Touch, the Focus also had the voice-activated Sync system that enables you to make calls or play music without fumbling with controls.\n\nThe Focus had good legroom in the backseat. I chalk it up to the deep seat benches. There also were interesting cubbies for gadgets located next to the rear doors.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nIn crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2012 Focus hatchback received four stars out of five overall. It got five stars in side crash tests and four stars in in frontal and rollover crash tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t crash-tested the 2012 Focus hatchback.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the Focus’ outboard seats. Child-safety seats were easy to install in the hatchback. With the driver’s seat adjusted for my 5-foot-5 frame, a rear-facing infant-safety fit well in the backseat.\n\nThe Focus has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Ford’s programmable MyKey is optional. The available Parking Technology Package ($695) includes a backup camera, parking sensors and Active Park Assist that parallel parks the car with minimal assistance from the driver.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Ford Focus here.",

      "expert_review": "Ford’s roomy little hatchback, the Focus ZX3, wiggles its way into your heart like a cute puppy. Not only is it fun to drive, but it has lots of room, won’t drain your bank account and offers tons of versatility.\n\nThe test car’s bright gold paint and 16-inch alloy wheels, shod with meaty 205/50 tires, give it a purposeful look that harkens back to VolkswagenÕs original GTI. But what separates the ZX3 from other hatchbacks is wonderfully linear steering, spunky performance and an interior that is almost as versatile as a small station wagon.\n\nZX3 prices start at $12,125, and the test car’s sticker of $14,850 makes it one of the better small-car bargains. That price includes power windows, power locks with keyless remote, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, 16-inch wheels, tilt//telescoping steering wheel, front armrest, cruise control and map lights.\n\nThe proof of such a tasty pudding is in the driving. Zippy acceleration comes courtesy of the 130-horsepower, 2.0-liter Zetec four-cylinder engine mounted transversely over the front wheels. This engine has sufficient mid-range power that it doesn’t have to be driven like it was stolen to keep up with traffic. When you want to shoot down the freeway ramp, it does so with more-than-ample energy, although engine noise is noticeable but not intrusive.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine how much fun the upcoming SVT Focus, with 170 horsepower and a six-speed manual gearbox, will be when it comes out later this year.\n\nKey to extracting the most out of 130 horsepower is a slick, five-speed transmission whose linkage is direct and tight. Shifting is impaired by the front armrest that interfers with your right elbow. When I folded the armrest back vertically between the seats it was less bothersome, but it would be nice if it wasn’t there at all.\n\nA significant option for 2001 is Ford’s AdvanceTrac vehicle stability program. AdvanceTrac invokes throttle control and the application of the brakes on individual wheels to help keep the car from skidding wildly in evasive manuevers. It is available on the ZX3 hatchback and the ZTS sedan, and while the test car did not have it, AdvanceTrac is sure to appeal to folks who want the peace of mind that a stability control program provides. Rear disc brakes are a part of the package, and that should improve stopping, too.\n\nSome might find the ZX3’s shape unusual, but it serves a couple of purposes. One, the tall roofline gives it an uncanny amount of interior space because occupants sit in a more upright position than in most small cars. The back seat is perfectly suitable for full-size adults, plus it folds down to create a cargo area almost as big as the Focus wagon.\n\nSecond, the sloping roofline contributes to a 0.32 coefficient of drag, and that in turn helps improve fuel efficiency and reduce wind noise. The floor pan ahead of the rear axle is shaped to minimize underbody turbulence and cut drag, another nice touch for a car in this price segment .\n\nAside from being generously proportioned, the cabin of the Focus is well designed and executed. The instrument panel has a fun look, but, more importantly, it works very well. Surface textures on power window buttons and the wheels that control the air vents provide a tactile response as good as more expensive vehicles.\n\nCloth-covered seats are shaped to provide good all-around support without being overly confining. More lumbar support would be appeciated.\n\nThe ZX3’s responsive handling is largely the result of a multi-link independent rear axle and a zero-offset Macpherson strut front suspension. Body roll is minimized, as is squat and dive. The 16-inch alloy wheels with wide tires play an important role, as well.\n\nHatchbacks seem to be making a resurgence in this country, and Ford will offer the five-door Focus ZX5 next fall. Good sense prevails.\n\nPrice The ZX3 starts at $12,125. Options on the test car included power windows, power locks with keyless r ote, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, 16-inch wheels, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, front armrest, cruise control and map lights.\n\nThe sticker price was $14,850.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.\n\n{Point:} The ZX3 hatchback is a delightful combination of fun and practicality. It has a European profile, excellent steering and a spacious cabin considering its overall size. Handling is above average, too.\n\n{Counterpoint:} The engine can be a bit noisy at full throttle, the outside mirrors could be bigger and firmer lumbar padding in the front seat would add to the comfort level. The center armrest interferes with shifting.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 2.0-liter, 4-cyl.\nTransmission: Five-speed Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 103 inches\nCurb weight: 2,551 lbs.\nBase price: $12,125\nAs driven: $14,850\nMpg rating: 25 city, 33 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "For those of us with a car-as-appliance mind-set — cars are bought for utility, price and expected service, like a toaster or refrigerator — the Ford Focus, since its introduction as a 2000 model, has been one of America’s most popular choices. Ford sold more than 177,000 of them in 2006, not bad for a vehicle that has had only minor updates since it was introduced.\n\nThe Focus is due for its most extensive freshening yet for the 2008 model year, but because the basic platform will remain, the changes will be more cosmetic than mechanical. Even so, Ford is offering attractive incentives to keep the ’07 Focus moving, so for the car-as-appliance folks, less concerned than most with having the latest and greatest, the Focus might be particularly appealing right now.\n\nThe Focus is indeed a workhorse, but in midlevel SE trim, as the test car was, it is not that much fun to drive. Steering feel is rubbery and handling is less precise than in its competitors, but the powertrain — a 2.0-liter, 136-horsepower four-cylinder engine, with a four-speed automatic transmission — works just fine. Uplevel Focus models have an even better 2.3-liter four-cylinder shared with Mazda, but for everyday driving, this 2.0-liter gets the job done. And it does it with very good mileage — 27 miles per gallon in the city, 34 mpg on the highway, on regular gasoline.\n\nInside, the Focus SE is basic and a bit plastic-heavy; in the test car, the flimsy little folding center console was already showing signs of wear. Cloth-covered front bucket seats are fine, and rear-seat room isn’t bad for a car this size. Trunk space is also generous.\n\nOn the road, the Focus is large enough to make highway driving comfortable and secure. The test model had the optional $750 “safety package,” which included side air bags and anti-lock brakes. It also had the $225 “convenience group,” which provided cruise control and a tilting steering wheel. Standard stuff included air conditioning, a good AM-FM stereo with CD player, remote keyless entry, and power locks and windows.\n\nBase price on the Focus SE is $15,070, and with options and $595 shipping, plus a $400 discount for the safety package, the total price was $17,055. But, as mentioned, you can do a lot better than that with discounts and rebates.\n\nThe Focus SE is a solid little car that is beginning to show its age. How much 2008’s face-lift will correct that remains to be seen, but the current model still gets the job done, and cheaply.",

      "expert_review": "For ’05, Focus is on styling, lower emissions\n\nFord says consumers will be happy to know they can get a PZEV or a ULEV Focus for the ’05 model year.\n\nOf course, consumers probably would be even happier if they knew what PZEV or ULEV means.\n\nPZEV stands for partial zero-emission vehicle and ULEV stands for ultra-low-emission vehicle. PZEV means the car produces about the same amount of emissions as a gas/electric vehicle, and ULEV means it isn’t as clean as a gas/electric but still produces fewer emissions than a non-ULEV vehicle.\n\nFor 2005 the compact Ford Focus, which is now at dealerships, has replaced its 2-liter, 110-horsepower single-overhead cam and 2-liter, 130-h.p. dual-overhead cam Zetec 4-cylinder engines with two versions of a new 2-liter, 136-h.p. 4 designated as Duratec 20 or Duratec 20E.\n\nThe Duratec 20 is offered in all 50 states, and the 20E is a PZEV and a SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) sold only in New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont and California, which have stricter emissions regulations than other states.\n\nAlso, Ford offers a 2.3-liter, 151-h.p. dual-overhead cam Duratec 23 ULEV 4-cylinder in a new performance Focus designated the ZX4 ST.\n\nTo be blunt, unless you’re the one who came up with all those silly LEV designations, no one other than a card-carrying Sierra Club member gives a hoot. Suffice it to say Focus will spit less pollutants into the air we all breathe for ’05 than it did in ’04.\n\nAnd they’ll all go farther on a gallon of gas, 1 m.p.g. more in the city, 2 m.p.g. on the highway. Plus they’ll travel even farther between refills because the tank has been increased by 2 gallons.\n\nWhat most people will notice, however, isn’t the LEV ranking or the added miles between fills, but the the ’05 Focus’ new sheet metal.\n\nFocus has received what’s called a minor freshening for ’05, its first cosmetic remake since it bowed in the 2000 model year. But it sure looks like major surgery–and successful surgery at that.\n\nNew front- and rear-end treatment, especially noticeable upfront, where the sharply creased hood has given way to more subtle creases to now appear wider and lower hood, though 1 inch higher.\n\nHeadlamps have been moved forward and have more of a jewel-like appearance. Turn signals were moved from the grille to alongside the headlamps and the honeycomb grille resembles that to be used on the 2005 Ford Five Hundred sedan.\n\nThe cloth seat covers look richer and provide more support. And wherever a storage compartment would fit, it was added. The changes were made in response to owners who asked for upgrades and refinement–as well as two more cupholders, one in each front door.\n\n“The voice of the customer drove the changes for ’05,” said John Sidelko, chief engineer for Focus, who also admitted that results of the J.D. Power and Associates Appeal Survey on what consum ers liked or didn’t like about their vehicle also prompted a few tweaks.\n\nWe tested the ’05 ZX4 ST sedan that Sidelko insists isn’t the replacement for the performance SVT Focus that won’t be offered for ’05.\n\n“The ZX4 ST doesn’t substitute for the SVT even though it appeals to a similar enthusiast customer. They both share much the same personality, but the ZX4 ST is more refined,” he said.\n\n“The 2004 model year is the last for the SVT Focus and is off the radar screen at this point in time so the SVT team could concentrate on other projects, such as the Ford GT, Ford Lightning and the Mustang Cobra,” Sidelko said.\n\nThe ZX4 ST has some performance-tuned suspension components from the SVT. Those who have driven both probably will say the ZX4 ST is a little more refined, less harsh and quieter despite a noticeable exhaust rumble. The ride is pleasant without being jostling and jarring. Handling is crisp and accurate and steering response above averag for an economy car at heart–because that heart had an SVT suspension transplant.\n\nAlso contributing, of course, is the 2.3-liter, 151-h.p. engine. It delivers less horsepower than the SVT Focus (170 h.p.), but boasts more off-the-line torque than the SVT (154 foot-pounds versus 145). Yet it’s rated at a most respectable 23 m.p.g. city/32 m.p.g. highway versus 21/25 for the SVT.\n\nThe 2.3-liter is teamed only with a smooth shifting 5-speed manual. Sidelko said there’s no technical reason the ZX4 ST couldn’t have offered an automatic, but Ford felt that enthusiasts prefer manuals. Because enthusiasts will be the primary buyers, manual it is. So no extra-cost automatic.\n\nThe ’05 Focus is built on the same platform as the ’04 Focus, and the European Focus is built off a new global platform shared with the Mazda 3 and Volvo S40. The next-generation Focus is expected to share that global platform, but Sidelko wouldn’t say.\n\nSome suggest the global platform means the U.S. Focus could offer all-wheel-drive and perhaps a couple of even more potent engines; a 180-h.p. and a 200-h.p. 4-cylinder have been speculated.\n\nSidelko said that AWD “might put the car out of reach for the entry-level buyer concerned about price” and that he “doesn’t know of any upcoming planned new engine offerings.”\n\nBase price of the ZX4 ST is $17,705. There are only six options–side-impact air bags, a Sony audiophile upgrade with six-disc rather than single-disc CD/MP3 player, alarm system, power moonroof, suede seats and heated seats. The test car came with the moonroof ($625), side air bags ($350), alarm ($125), heated seats ($115) and audiophile upgrade ($455).\n\nStandard equipment includes four-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; power windows, door locks and mirrors (not seats); air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player; passenger seat sensing system to prevent air-bag deployment when empty; fog lamps; decklid spoiler; 16-inch radial tires; and body-color outside mirrors, door handles, moldings and front and rear fascia.\n\nNoteworthy features include positioning a power plug in the dash alongside the radio to make it easy to plug in the cell phone without tangling the cord on the gearshift lever, and placing the trunk-lid release button on the dash behind and to the left of the steering column, again making it easy to see and use. And for a compact, trunk space is abundant.\n\nThe original Focus stumbled out of the gate and suffered a number of recalls. Sidelko is quick to point out that in the latest J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey, Focus has moved to 6th place in its segment, up from 17th–and that’s before the many changes instituted for ’05.\n\nSidelko wouldn’t forecast sales, but noted the ’05 Focus reached showrooms in May and sales rose 17 percent that month.\n\nStrictly personal: Birthday greetings to Ashley Marie, daughter of Mrs. Twin No. 1, wh o is celebrating No. 5.\n\nAnd, as always, memories of grandson Peyton who would have been 7. – – –\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2005 Ford Focus ZX4 ST\n\nWheelbase: 103 inches\n\nLength: 168.5 inches\n\nEngine: 2.3-liter, 151-h.p. 4-cylinder\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\n\nFuel economy: 23 m.p.g. city/32 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $17,705\n\nPrice as tested: $19,375.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced for 2000, the European-designed Focus quickly became Ford’s top-selling passenger car. Reworked for 2005, the front-wheel-drive compact comes in four body styles. They include the ZX3 three-door hatchback, ZX5 five-door hatchback, ZX4 sedan and ZXW wagon. Trim levels include the entry-level S, midrange SE and upscale SES.\n\nAnother selection, the ZX4 ST sedan, rides on a performance-oriented suspension that borrowed components from the old SVT Focus. The ST’s 151-horsepower, 2.3-liter four-cylinder exceeds the standard for Ultra Low Emissions Vehicles.\n\nRegular Focus models use a 2.0-liter four-cylinder rated at 136 hp. In states with strict emissions requirements, a 130-hp version is installed.\n\nFor 2006, a Street Appearance Package can give the ZX4 a custom look. Later in the model year, that package will also be offered on the ZX3 and ZX5. All Focus models now have a CD/MP3 player, and the optional six-CD changer adds steering-wheel controls.\n(Skip to details on the: Focus Wagon)\n\nExterior\nAt 168.5 inches long overall, Focus hatchbacks are nearly 7 inches shorter than the Honda Civic sedan and 10 inches shorter than Toyota’s Corolla. Focus sedans measure 175.2 inches from stem to stern.\n\nThe front end of the Focus echoes the look of Ford’s larger Five Hundred sedan. The headlamps have clear lenses, and the grille displays a diamond pattern. Round fog lamps are installed, and the fascia has a wide, low air intake. S and SE models get 15-inch tires, while the SES holds 16-inch alloy wheels. The ST gets unique 16-inch machined-alloy wheels and all-disc brakes.\n\nInterior\nThe Focus’ seats are relatively high — part of a long, tall interior that’s designed to accommodate taller and older people, despite Ford’s emphasis on the youth market. Large doorways ease entry and exit. Big, clearly labeled controls are convenient to reach.\n\nA symmetrical instrument panel greets the driver. The ZX4 ST has optional suede seating surfaces.\n\nFord says the Focus not only seats five comfortably, but it’s also roomier than key rivals. The backseat folds down to expand cargo capacity. Focus sedans have a 14.8-cubic-foot trunk; hatchbacks promise 17.6 cubic feet of space when the seats are up and nearly 40 cubic feet with the seats folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFord’s 136-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder teams with a four-speed automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. A 151-hp 2.3-liter engine that issues 154 pounds-feet of torque goes into the ZX4 ST sedan, which comes only with a manual gearbox and has a performance-tuned exhaust system.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional on all models except the ZX4 ST, which includes them as standard equipment. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe European heritage of the Focus reveals itself mainly in the car’s crisp cornering ability and its roomy, upright, ergonomically oriented interior. Hatchback models look sharper than the sedans.\n\nThe manual-shift ZX3 is frisky. It accelerates eagerly from a standstill and is quite spirited for passing and merging. Focus hatchbacks are highly maneuverable and fun to drive. Smooth clutch action and a gearbox that works fairly easily contribute to driving enjoyment.\n\nRide comfort is firm but above par, and the suspension deals competently with urban bumps. Despite thick pillars, the long side glass helps visibility in the hatchback. Front-seat headroom is huge.�\n\nFocus Wagon\nAt 178.4 inches long overall, the Focus Wagon is nearly a foot longer than Focus hatchbacks. Wagon models have 73.1 cubic feet of cargo capacity when the seats are folded down and 35.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up. The 136-hp four-cylinder is standard. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes, even for the all-knowing, prescient, and infallible automotive journalist, a car arrives that is full of surprise.\n\nI am driving such a car as I enter a climbing S-curve at 50 miles per hour. I am in third gear, the exhaust is rumbling behind me, and just for giggles I shift up into fourth at 4,000 rpms and stomp the gas. The car rockets forward, the exhaust note deepens, and the smile on my face broadens. Am I in a hot, tuned Honda? No. Am I in a screaming Subaru Impreza WRX? No.\n\nI am in a front-wheel-drive Ford Focus and I have come to realize that there is a theme to this car: Drive it hard, drive it fast, corner it fast, brake it hard.\n\nIt is not, of course, just any Ford Focus. It is the 2002 SVT Focus, built by the professional Ford tuners from the base that is the three-door hatchback Focus ZX3.\n\nFrom the outside, the special vehicle team’s changes are noticeable to true fans of hot, front-wheel or all-wheel-drive performance cars (the muscle cars of this decade for speed aficianados), yet subtle enough to go largely unspotted by those for whom a car is just transportation.\n\nThe bumpers and rocker panels are molded and fitted in a more muscular grip around the lower body; a mesh grille gives it a European flair; a rear spoiler gives a saucy flip to the roofline; 17-inch, five-spoke wheels with low-profile tires are a snazzy addition; and if none of these elements catches your eye, the bold SVT badging won’t tell you anything anyway.\n\nBut where the SVT Focus really departs is under the hood (and with some nifty interior touches).\n\nIt has the 2.0-liter, 16-valve, inline four-cylinder, DOHC Zetec engine that is in the ZX3 &#151; sort of. Sort of given that this one has forged steel connecting rods, cast-aluminum pistons, a dual-stage intake manifold, variable cam timing on the intake shaft, bigger intake ports (we’re talking bigger gulps of air here, folks), and a tuned underbody catalyst sytem.\n\nThat means that instead of the ZX3’s 130 horsepower and 135 lb.-ft. of torque, the SVT delivers 170 horsepower and 145 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nIt is mated to a six-speed transmission that clicks firmly and quickly up through the gears. That’s a good thing because, with torque lacking at the lower end, you need to zip right through first and second to get where the fun begins &#151; up around 2,000 rpms. Let it wind from there in second, or go right into third. You’ll find the redline &#151; and the next shift &#151; soon enough.\n\nIt moves so smoothly and benignly through the lower gears that driving it in traffic is not a pain, as is often the case with high-revving, twitchy cars. With this one, it’s just a matter of realizing that as you move up, it lives to rev.\n\nAutoweek magazine ran the SVT against the Honda Civic Si and the Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V and, at 7.32 seconds from 0-60, it was faster than either by a fraction of a second. More im pressively, Autoweek found that on the slalom course, it was quicker than the Sentra SE-R, the Mercedes-Benz AMG C32, and the Subaru Impreza WRX. That’s cookin’ and cornerin’.\n\nI hurled this car into corners, made snapping lane changes on the highway, downshifted before I entered corners and stomped the gas exiting them, and the car sat flat with virtually no body roll. It was that stiff. Yet, surprisingly, in normal driving, it felt pliant and almost gentle.\n\nWith stiffer shocks and stiffer spring rates than the ZX3, and beefed up antiroll bars, the SVT suspension has struts, coil springs, damper units and antiroll bar up front. In the rear, there is an independent multilink system with dampers and antiroll bar.\n\nBrakes are all discs, nearly a foot in diameter, with ABS. In emergency braking they stopped the SVT quickly and on a virtually perfect straight line.\n\nInside, the SVT people did a fine job of giving this Focus a sporty feel.\n\nTwo- one seats are trimmed in leather (inserts match exterior colors) and the front buckets have excellent thigh and torso bolsters found on far more expensive sports cars. The shift knob and handbrake are wrapped in leather, each has leather boots, and the steering wheel is leather-wrapped as well. Aluminum pedals with black knobs add to the performance car feel.\n\nGauges are black lettering on titanium, with the tachometer and speedometer big and centered right behind the wheel.\n\nThe sound system tops the center-dash control pod and its controls include one large volume knob and large, rectangular adjustment/tuning buttons.\n\nClimate control consists of three large circular knobs, a pair of triangular buttons for air conditioning and circulation, and a lone triangle for rear window defroster. Simple and clean all around.\n\nHeadroom is excellent up front, moderately good in the rear. The rear seat is quite comfortable for two while the middle passenger had best be a small child. Leg room in the back is just OK.\n\nStandard features on the SVT Focus include: ABS, front fog lamps, 60/40 split rear seat with fold down back and flip-up cushions, power folding and heated outside mirrors, power windows, door locks, and trunk release, air conditioning, and rear window defroster. Also thrown in are cruise control buttons on the steering wheel and extra audio controls on a pod just below the turn signal on the left side of the steering column.\n\nThe only options (and they came on the test car) include a winter package with heated seats, traction control, and engine block heater (at $395 a good deal here in New England); a power moonroof ($595); and an upgraded sound system with a 290-watt in-dash AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD changer, premium speakers and an 8-inch subwoofer with amplifier ($675).\n\nAll these extras and the car still costs less than $20,000. And it runs with the best of the hot tuners of today.\n\nHey, sometimes even the prescient get surprised.\n\n2002 Ford SVT Focus\n\nBase price: $17,480\n\nPrice as tested: $19,660\n\nHorsepower: 170\n\nTorque: 145 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 103.0 inches\n\nOverall length: 168.1 inches\n\nWidth: 66.9 inches\n\nHeight: 56.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,750 lbs.\n\nSeating: 4 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 20.2 miles per gallon\n\nSource: Ford Motor Co.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch\n\nThe single button remote mirror control in the “V” where A-pillar meets the front of the driver’s armrest. Logical placement, easy to use.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nNot much in the way of interior storage bins. Where’s a hot young tuner going to put all those CDs? The lip balm? The sunglasses?",

      "expert_review": "Is it souped yet?\nFord and others are making a furious push into the sport accessories market.\n\nSport compact “tuner” car culture – a la “The Fast and the Furious” – emerged in the mid-’90s when a generation of new drivers began fixing up their beloved first cars, mostly used Honda Civics, Preludes and Accords. These cars, while exceptionally sound mechanically, were about as sexy as corrective headgear.\n\nKids wanting to invest these grotty hand-me-downs with some style and performance had to rely on their ingenuity, for the most part. High school auto shop classes became crowded with kids laying up their own fiberglass air dams, welding megaphonic extensions to tailpipes and taking cutting torches to springs.\n\nIn this respect, sport-compact tuning materialized out of the same ether as hot rodding in the 1940s and ’50s. Both were grass-roots, anarchic, existentially D.I.Y. Both began as eyeball engineering, where if something looked fast, then it was fast.\n\nAnd both movements quickly aroused vast, highly specialized industries to support them. By the late 1960s, hot rodders could draw from a pornocopia of high-performance goods found in the back pages of Hot Rod magazine or Hemmings Motor News; brands like Edlebrock, Hurst, Holley, Rochester and Flowmaster have become bits of gear-head Americana.\n\nLikewise, current issues of Sport Compact Car magazine — what Guns and Ammo is to the rifle-in-the-tower set — are crowded with ads shilling everything from screaming “Stage III” turbochargers to carbon-fiber rear spoilers the size of blackjack tables. Some aftermarket companies are familiar, blue-chip firms like AP Racing, Eibach, Neuspeed and Momo. Some evolved out of racing, such as CompTech and NOS. Others are purely creatures of the tuner phenomenon, like Greddy, APC and Wings West. The sport-compact aftermarket is now worth more than $3.2-billion a year.\n\nThe limiting factor to all this rampant prosperity is that relatively few people have the tools or know-how to properly modify modern cars. This is a key difference between hot rodding and tuning: Most tuning is not D.I.Y., but D.I.F.M., “do it for me.” Bad things happen when inexperienced hobbyists stuff leaf-blower turbochargers, lumpy cams and Taiwanese electronic control modules under the hood. Such monstrosities often detonate in festive clouds of carbon-fiber shrapnel.\n\nYou may ask why anyone beyond a hormone-sotted teenager should care. It’s because the aftermarket is heading your way.\n\nThis I predict: Very soon, car buyers will be able to choose from a punch-list of factory-approved tuner parts available through your local dealer — HKS exhaust system? Check. Brembo brakes? Check — and all conveniently installed and financed as part of the car’s purchase price. No tools, no mess, just a checkbook.\n\nIt seems inevitable: What began as a fringy, outlaw car hobby — born in teenage status anxiety and bred in thousands of garages stinking of smoked pistons — will go mainstream as part of an increasingly sophisticated array of dealer options. Why? Because that’s where the money is.\n\nIt’s already happening. Toyota has its own aftermarket division, Toyota Racing Development, whose parts are sold through authorized dealers. You can now order its superchargers for most of the engines in Toyota’s paddock. The superchargers come with a one-year guarantee. If the dealer installs the unit, Toyota will honor the vehicle’s powertrain warranty.\n\nIs your 230-hp Dodge SRT-4 feeling a little limp? DaimlerChrysler’s Mopar division will soon offer, through its authorized dealers, a thermonuclear turbo upgrade that will raise the engine output to 300 hp and 300 pound-feet of torque.\n\nAnd last month, Ford Racing Performance Parts introduced its own catalog of aftermarket pieces for its Focus coupe, one of the best-handling and most popular hot hatches on the market. The “F t Focus” wish-book offers everything from whiteface competition gauges and carbon-fiber shift knobs to a Jackson Racing supercharger kit, all available through Ford authorized dealers, with optional installation.\n\nMass customization: It’s not just an oxymoron anymore.\n\nI spent a couple of weeks recently in a Ford Focus SVT that had been breathed on by the folks at Ford and Roush Racing, using parts from the new Fast Focus catalog. It felt like the future. No screwy suspension geometry to make the car all wonky on straight roads. No strange noises or burning smells. The car felt bone-stock, only faster.\n\nThe Focus is a leading contender in the FIA World Rally Championship, and our test car had a distinctly Euro flavor to it. The aggressive body cladding — styled after the Focus Rally RS package — looked like it had grown in place. The test car was kitted with the European Appearance package, including high-intensity discharge headlamps, mirrored tail lamps, moon roof, rib-gripping Recaro seats and a stereo system fully capable of making manhole covers jump from their sockets.\n\nWith its glossy black wheels and glittering, prismatic eyes, the yellow car had the capricious malevolence of an angry bee.\n\nThe performance parts integrated seamlessly into the car. This car’s SVT engine — a 2.0-liter Zetec four-banger — had been fitted with the Jackson Supercharger. On the hot side of the engine, the car exhaled through a Borla cat-back system (a high-flow exhaust replacing the stock pieces from the catalytic converter back, for $479). Thus ventilated, the Focus gusted along on 220 horsepower, 50 more than the stock SVT and enough to slap-shot the car to 60 mph in just under seven seconds.\n\nBeneath its composite-panel petticoats, the Focus had been modified with a lowered sport suspension — up-rated springs and struts — and shod with the black-anodized 17-inch wheels. These pieces didn’t change the Focus SVT’s handling so much as scaled the limits upward. Grippy, balanced and easy to drive on the limit, the catalog-enhanced SVT negotiated the coils of the Angeles Crest like a bubble-shaped BMW.\n\nAnd there you have it: an off-the-shelf tuner car, no assembly required.\n\nThere are some curiosities to report. The Jackson supercharger for the Focus SVT retails for $2,795 if ordered directly from the company. Ford charges an additional $305 for the same piece. Also, Jackson offers a one-year guarantee on the unit, while Ford makes no such offer. Such price premiums and stingy warranty policies may change as more of the automakers compete in the dealer-side aftermarket business.\n\nHot rodding was never quite co-opted by the major manufacturers, though before the first oil crunch of the early 1970s low-volume performance vehicles like the Corvette LT-1 and Pontiac GTO did vie for enthusiasts’ attention. As the automakers move further into the tuner aftermarket, something of the culture ‘s raw exuberance and wildcatting spirit is diminished. But the engineering is getting better. Will this underground hobby survive when it’s exposed to the sun?\n\nStay tuned.\n\n2004 Ford Focus SVT Tuner\n\nWheelbase: 103 inches\n\nLength: 168.1 inches\n\nPowertrain: 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder, supercharged, six-speed manual transmission, front-wheel drive\n\nOptional equipment: European Appearance Package (sound system, Recaro seats ); Jackson Racing supercharger, Borla cat-back exhaust system, coilover suspension system, 17-inch rally wheels, Ford Racing floor mats\n\nHorsepower: approximately 220 at 7,000 rpm\n\nAcceleration: 0 to 60 mph in seven seconds\n\nPrice, base: $18,590\n\nPrice, as tested: $27,420",

      "expert_review": "The left front wheel was out of alignment. It shimmied at high speeds. The steering wheel vibrated. We were tempted to return the 2003 Ford Focus SE sedan to the airport Hertz fleet.\n\nBut we looked at the odometer. This rental car had been driven 25,000 miles before we picked it up. Later, we checked its vehicle identification number and manufacture date. Judging from that information, the Focus had been in service a bit more than five months. That worked out to an average 5,000 miles per month, which meant the Focus was going to auction.\n\nGood car-rental companies don’t keep high-mileage cars. They ship them for resale. Hertz is a good car-rental company. Our high-mileage 2003 car was a traveler. It came to the New Orleans fleet from Texas, which is why it was still hanging around when we arrived.\n\nWe decided to keep the car, partly because I told my traveling partner, Martha McNeil Hamilton, that driving a hard-driven “new” car would make a good column. We had lots of running around to do on our book tour in New Orleans and New Iberia, my late mother’s Louisiana hometown, about 130 miles west of here.\n\n“Let’s see how it holds up,” I suggested. Martha said “Hmph,” by which I assumed she meant “Yes.”\n\nIt was a revealing experience, quite different from driving the factory-fresh vehicles that usually grace this column. It offered an insight into the way rental companies think, which is not the way many individual car buyers think.\n\nThat’s because car-rental companies don’t sell cars. They sell fantasy, convenience. To them, a car is a mobile extension of your hotel. So the rental companies do what Hertz did with our Focus SE sedan. They order it with the base engine: a 2-liter inline four-cylinder Zetec that produces 110 horsepower. They order the four-speed automatic transmission (called the “transaxle” in front-wheel-drive cars such as the Focus) because most rental customers in the United States don’t want manual gearboxes.\n\nThere’s something else. The rental companies assume that budget-minded customers who ask for small cars aren’t interested in performance and handling. So rental companies order base suspension systems to go with the base engines.\n\nBut the rental companies also assume that budget-minded customers would be delighted to have an economy car with lots of luxury touches, which is why our Focus came with power windows and locks, a power-operated trunk lid, a good audio system, and the “upscale” velour-covered seats that Ford thinks are more appealing to older buyers. (In the Focus, Ford offers “sporty woven seat materials . . . aimed at younger buyers,” according to its product summaries.) Anyway, the cosmetic stuff had a soothing effect. It all worked properly, too, and Hertz did an excellent job of presenting a car with a commendably clean, fresh-smelling interior. Hertz has apparently started putting no-smoking signs in some of its cars, as there was one in our Focus. Good idea.\n\nThe shimmy came and went, as often is the case with such disorders. Luckily, in our case, it went more than it came. But in driving around New Orleans and environs, we quickly surmised where that shimmy might have come from. The city’s streets are absolutely awful, even worse than those in the District of Columbia, which I thought was impossible before I returned here, to my hometown.\n\nStill, even with that intermittent left-wheel problem, the Focus SE sedan turned out to be a delight. It handled extremely well in panic highway maneuvers. Overall ride comfort was good, although the seats could use a bit more work in that area. That little 110-horsepower engine turned out to be more gutsy than wimpy, certainly for regional travel. The sedan’s trunk, measuring 12.9 cubic feet, was big enough to carry two suitcases and an assortment of personal and computer bags.\n\nFrankly, anybody in the market r a truly cheap ride should track down this one, or one like it, at a car auction. Hertz says it will fix the left front wheel’s alignment problem.",
