      "expert_review": "Three people, three bicycles and one Explorer Sport Trac are an ideal recipe for recreation.\n\nThe weather was considerably warmer earlier this month when my friends and I piled our bikes into Ford’s part-truck, part-SUV for a Sunday afternoon ride on the gravel roads south of Lawrence, Kan. Ford’s segment-defining Sport Trac was designed for occasions precisely like that, and seen in that context the vehicle makes tremendous sense. The cabin, which is essentially the same as that of a regular Explorer, has all the amenities of an SUV, yet the open cargo box keeps dirty or oversized objects, such as mountain bikes, separate from occupants. Sport Trac feels like an SUV and hauls like a truck, albeit one with a small box.\n\nThe composite cargo box, slightly more than 4 feet long, is grafted onto the back of the cabin. Since it is not made from steel, it is impervious to rust, and the molded black lining resists scratches and dents from rugged loads. There are 10 tie-downs for securing cargo, and they are strong enough to move a refrigerator, Ford says.\n\nThe optional aluminum tubular cargo cage really extends the Sport Trac’s usefulness. It bolts into the back of the bed and, when folded out onto an open tailgate, it creates a cargo space nearly 6 feet long. With the tailgate closed, it flips into the bed and creates a barrier that corrals small objects from sliding around.\n\nA lockable cargo cover is optional, as is a removable plastic divider that allows the box to be partitioned into two separate areas.\n\nFord is not alone with such a vehicle. Dodge has the crew cab Dakota, Nissan the four-door Frontier, and Chevrolet will unveil the Avalanche next year. Lincoln’s Blackwood is a luxury model that combines the Navigator interior with a covered bed derived from the F-150 SuperCrew.\n\nFord touts the Sport Trac as being more than an SUV, which is true. It melds the people-hauling capabilities of an SUV with the cargo carrying of a small pickup truck. The two-wheel drive version starts at $23,050, while four-wheel drive begins at $25,365.\n\nThe 2001 Sport Trac, with a wheelbase of 125.9 inches, is built on an Explorer frame that has been lengthened 14.25 inches. The frame has been stifened for a better ride, which is now almost as supple as a passenger car.\n\nThe 205-horsepower, 4.0-liter, overhead-cam V6 engine delivers a modest amount of power in a smooth, unobtrusive way. The five-speed automatic transmission is a model of smooth shifting and civility. A manual will also be available. It can haul a payload of 1,500 pounds and tow more than 5,000 pounds.\n\nThe cabin is basically the same size as in a standard Explorer, and even though the back seat looks smaller, it has as much head, leg and shoulder room as the regular Explorer. It is well-equipped and nicely styled. The instrument panel has light-faced gauges like those in a sport sedan. The radio, on the other hand, relies on a button, instead o f a knob, for changing stations.\n\nLow-back bucket seats open up the interior and keep rear-seat passengers from feeling claustrophobic. A removable nylon sport bag sits inside the console. Fitted with a strap and side netting, it can carry snacks, CDs, cell phones or even lunch.\n\nThe floor is covered with thick rubber so it can be cleaned easily in the aftermath of outdoor use. The rubber also cuts down on the amount of road noise that filters into the cabin. Berber carpet floor mats lend a civilized feel.\n\nCloth seats are standard, but considering how much easier it is to clean leather, I think the leather option is preferable. Besides, the leather package includes a rear console with separate audio and climate controls, cupholders and two headphone jacks.\n\nThe 60/40 rear seat folds to accommodate large items, like luggage, inside the cabin. The power rear window can be lowered for ventilation or access to the cargo box.\n\nA small storage compartment, gen ugh for a camera, is built into the cabin wall behind the back seat. Tether anchors for three child safety seats are also standard.\n\nOther things to note:\n\nAnti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nA battery saver cuts off all interior lights after 40 minutes to keep from running down the battery.\n\nLaminated steel in the instrument panel, thick door seals and sound-deadening material in the door and windshield pillars cut down on noise.\n\nThe frame is coated with rust-resistant primer, a first for Ford.\n\nThe Sport Trac typifies the way manufacturers are able to respond to customer demand and design a vehicle that fills a specific niche. The idea is so popular that additional variations on the same theme are bound to follow.\n\nPrice: The base price of the test vehicle was $25,365. Options included a 4:10 limited-slip rear axle, AM/FM/CD stereo, power moonroof, aluminum wheels, side step bar, leather, power driver seat, cargo cage, cruise control and tilt wheel. The sticker price was $30,630.\n\nWarranty: Three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Sport Trac is a perfect companion for outdoor activities because it separates dirty cargo from a passenger compartment that is large enough to hold four people in carlike comfort.\n\nCounterpoint: There is no lockable luggage compartment unless you choose the optional lockable bed cover, which I have not seen yet.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.0-liter V6\nTransmission: automatic\nFour-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 125.9 inches\nCurb weight: 4,323 lbs.\nBase price: $25,365\nAs driven: $30,630\nMpg rating: 15 city, 19 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Explorer Sport Trac has a pickup bed in back where most SUVs would have an enclosed cargo area. The Explorer Sport Trac seats five and is available in XLT and Limited trim levels. Its competitors include crew cab pickups such as the Honda Ridgeline, Dodge Dakota quad cab and Nissan Frontier crew cab.\n\nThe Explorer Sport Trac adapts an independent rear suspension from the Explorer— a setup that usually trades off-road capability for on-road handling ability — that’s only matched by the Ridgeline.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no significant changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nThe Explorer Sport Trac wears the same slatted grille and scalloped headlights as the Explorer, but adds nearly 17 inches in length to accommodate a 4.5-foot pickup bed replete with side rails, tie-down hooks, a composite liner and three in-floor storage containers.\n\nAvailable 16-, 17-, 18- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard power mirrors\nStandard power-sliding rear window\nOptional keypad entry\nOptional heated mirrors\nOptional automatic headlamps\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nDashboard components mimic the Explorer: A tall center stack has radio controls above the air vents and connects to a floor-mounted console box below. Front bucket seats and a second-row bench provide seating for up to five.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls\nStandard power windows and locks\nOptional Sync system\nOptional voice-activated navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike the Ridgeline, the Explorer Sport Trac has an independent rear suspension, which is rare for a truck. When properly equipped, the rear-wheel-drive V-8-powered Explorer Sport Trac can tow up to 7,160 pounds.\n\n210-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-6 with 254 pounds-feet of torque\n292-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 with 315 pounds-feet of torque\nFive- (V-6) or six-speed automatic (V-8)\nAvailable 4×2 and 4×4 driveline options for both engines\n\nSafety\nStandard trailer-sway control works with the stability system to either apply the brakes or adjust engine response to help keep the trailer in line. Other safety features include:\n\nStandard front side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability control\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nOptional reverse sensing system\nOptional power-adjustable pedals",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nTwo-in-one vehicles have caught the fancy of quite a few shoppers lately. Fords sport utility vehicle/pickup truck crossover debuted as an early 2001 model and soon proved to be surprisingly popular.\n\nThe Explorer Sport Trac is essentially a previous-generation, four-door, five-passenger Explorer with an open, 4-foot, pickup-style cargo box added at the rear. Ford targets buyers who need a utility vehicle that might actually get dirty by going off-road, hauling mountain bikes and other lifestyle accessories, or carrying lumber and gardening supplies. General Motors used this concept as the basis for the Cadillac Escalade EXT and Chevrolet Avalanche.\n\nEquipment changes mark the 2004 Explorer Sport Trac, which features a revised instrument cluster in a freshened interior. Four trim levels are available: XLS, XLT, XLT Premium and Adrenalin. The Adrenalin edition features a 510-watt Pioneer sound system, fog lamps, side step bars and chrome wheels.\n\nExterior\nTo create the Sport Trac, developers first stretched the Explorers frame by 15 inches. They also incorporated more aggressive styling, such as flared rear fenders, than the regular four-door Explorer exhibits. Built on a 125.9-inch wheelbase, the Explorer Sport Trac measures 205.9 inches long overall, 71.8 inches wide and 70.5 inches tall.\n\nThe rear cargo bed is made of sheet-molded composite, which is a heavy-duty plastic that resists rust and dents. An optional, tubular steel cargo cage can extend the load area by 22 inches. Another option is a lockable hard tonneau cover that protects cargo contents.\n\nInterior\nLike the older Explorer, the Sport Trac seats five people on cloth-upholstered low-back bucket seats up front and a 60/40-split, folding rear bench. Power lumbar support and leather-trimmed heated front seats are available. A standard power rear window allows access to the cargo area from the rear seat. The floor is covered with washable composite rubber that can be hosed down if it gets dirty.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.0-liter V-6 engine develops 210 horsepower and teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission. Either rear-wheel drive or ControlTrac II full-time four-wheel drive is available.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available, but a Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbag system may be installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWhat first seemed like a gimmick  combining two different types of vehicles  turned out to have a fair amount of practical value. Even though the Explorer Sport Trac looks strange to some people, owners who actually need to carry both passengers and cargo may appreciate this vehicles capabilities. But some people may still ask: If you want a pickup truck, why not buy one?\n\nBut be warned: This rig is big. It attracts quite a bit of attention, as do most dual-purpose vehicles. Even with the assistance of the tough-looking running boards, climbing aboard can be a challenge for shorter folks. Theres plenty of space in the front seat. The backseat is comparably spacious, but passengers may have to duck down slightly when entering.\n\nHandling and performance are standard-issue SUV qualities. The Explorer Sport Trac is fairly easy to drive and maneuver. Acceleration is energetic enough from a standstill, but automatic-transmission shifts are quite noticeable.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Ford Explorer Sport Trac, one of the earliest vehicles to combine SUV and pickup-truck qualities, was significantly upgraded for 2007. I’m not a big fan of the earlier Sport Tracs, finding them awkward, ill-handling and not very nice to look at. These complaints have been addressed in the new version. With a much stiffer frame and independent rear suspension, first seen on the Explorer SUV, the new Sport Trac rides smoothly and corners nicely with well-controlled body sway. It’s also really quiet, with scant road noise seeping into the attractive interior. There are now quite a few midsize pickups with four-door crew-cab setups, and nearly all have something in common: The extra cab length equates to a smaller cargo bed. On the Ford, the bed is just 50.inches long. Sport Trac, like some others, mitigates this limitation with a tubular bed extender that flips out onto the tailgate, adding nearly 2 feet to the bed length. Still, the bed extender is an imperfect solution: When stowed, it cuts into the cargo space. Compared with the previous version, the new Sport Trac is quite a bit bigger in every direction, immediately noticeable in the roomier interior. The independent rear suspension, rare in a pickup truck, is a stunning improvement. So Sport Trac has the amenities of an SUV, though without the enclosed wagon back, and the capabilities of a pickup, without the hauling capacity. Not exactly the best of both worlds, but a practical and versatile vehicle just the same.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The truck arrived with a V-8 engine, standard on the top-tier Limited. It provided good power and strong torque for a beefy craft weighing nearly 5,000 pounds. The overhead-cam, multi-valve engine, which has become a staple for Ford vehicles, runs very smoothly and lends Sport Trac an upscale feel. The engine gets excellent grades for low emissions, but gas mileage for this heavy vehicle is modest. The EPA rating is not much better for the 4-liter V-6, standard on lesser versions of Sport Trac. A six-speed automatic comes with the V-8 – the V-6 gets a five-speed – that felt highly competent. Shifts were dependable and nearly imperceptible.\n\nDRIVABILITY: The latest Sport Trac is based on a lengthened version of the 2006 Explorer SUV chassis rather than the platform from the cruder Ranger compact pickup truck, as it was before. It is a major upgrade that boosts ride and handling. The steering is light but responsive, and the four-wheel disc brakes come standard with antilock. Other electronic enhancements on the tester included Control Trac automatic four-wheel drive, with low-range as needed for off-roading; AdvanceTrac roll-stability control to thwart skids and possible rollovers; and Safety Canopy side-impact airbags that deploy not only in a side impact but if an impending rollover is sensed. The Safety Canopy is a $560 option.\n\nSTYLING: Sport Trac looks both stylish and rugged, with most of the front design coming from the new Explorer SUV. The cargo box is made of a dent-resistant composite. The tester came with an optional hard, lockable bed cover that essentially created a cavernous trunk. The cover can be folded back for tall cargo.\n\nINTERIOR: The Limited interior is plush and luxurious, with a simple, attractive dashboard. The rear seat has decent legroom.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A practical compromise for people who want a pickup but need an SUV.\n\nFord Explorer Sport Trac Limited\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door pickup truck, four-wheel drive. Engine: 4.6-liter V-8, 292 horsepower at 5,750 rpm, 300 pound-feet torque at 3,950. Transmission: Six-speed automatic. Wheelbase: 130.5 inches. Overall length: 210.2 inches. Curb weight: 4,793 inches. Towing capacity: 6,640 pounds. EPA rating: 15 city, 20 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Good drivability, attractive styling, versatility. LOWS: Modest fuel mileage, small cargo box, pricey with options.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $29,540. Price as tested: $35,175.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nLeather seats, $995. Moonroof, $850.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOver the past few years, two-in-one vehicles have captured considerable attention. Ford’s Explorer Sport Trac, which debuted for the 2001 model year, combines the attributes of a sport utility vehicle and a pickup truck. It’s proved to be surprisingly popular, though sales tapered off after some time in the company’s lineup.\n\nThe Explorer Sport Trac is essentially a previous-generation, four-door, five-passenger Explorer with an open, 4-foot pickup-style cargo box added at the rear. Ford targets buyers who need an SUV that might actually get dirty by going off-road, hauling mountain bikes and other lifestyle accessories, or carrying lumber and gardening supplies. General Motors used this concept as the basis for the Cadillac Escalade EXT and Chevrolet Avalanche.\n\nFour trim levels are available: XLS, XLT, XLT Premium and Adrenalin. The Adrenalin edition features a 510-watt Pioneer sound system, side step bars and chrome wheels. For 2005, a moonroof is available for the XLT edition. During the 2005 model year, all audio systems will gain MP3 and Sirius Satellite Radio capability.\n\nExterior\nTo create the Sport Trac, developers first stretched the Explorer’s frame by 15 inches. They also incorporated more aggressive styling elements than the regular four-door Explorer exhibits, such as flared rear fenders. Built on a 125.9-inch wheelbase, the Explorer Sport Trac measures 205.9 inches long overall, 71.8 inches wide and 70.5 inches tall.\n\nThe rear cargo bed is made of sheet-molded composite, which is a heavy-duty plastic that resists rust and dents. An optional, tubular steel cargo cage can extend the load area by 22 inches. Another option is a lockable hard tonneau cover that protects cargo contents.\n\nInterior\nLike Explorers predating 2002, the Sport Trac seats five people on cloth-upholstered low-back bucket seats up front and a 60/40-split folding rear bench. Power lumbar support and leather-trimmed heated front seats are available for higher-end models. The floor is covered with washable composite rubber that can be hosed down if it gets dirty.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.0-liter V-6 develops 205 horsepower and 242 pounds-feet of torque and teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission. Either rear-wheel drive or ControlTrac II full-time four-wheel drive is available. When properly equipped, an Explorer Sport Trac can tow 5,300 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available, but a Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbag system can be installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWhat first seemed like a gimmick � combining two different types of vehicles � turned out to have a fair amount of practical value. Even so, some people may ask: If you want a pickup truck, why not buy one?\n\nThis rig is big. Even with the assistance of the tough-looking running boards, climbing aboard can be a challenge for shorter folks. There’s plenty of space in the front seat; the backseat is comparably spacious, but passengers may have to duck down slightly when entering.\n\nHandling and performance are standard-issue SUV qualities. The Explorer Sport Trac is fairly easy to drive and maneuver. Acceleration is fairly energetic from a standstill, but automatic-transmission shifts are quite noticeable.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Explorer Sport Trac has a pickup bed in back where most SUVs would have an enclosed cargo area. The Explorer Sport Trac seats five and is available in XLT and Limited trim levels. Its competitors include crewcab pickups such as the Honda Ridgeline, Dodge Dakota Quad Cab and Nissan Frontier Crew Cab.\n\nThe Explorer Sport Trac adapts an independent rear suspension from the Explorer — a setup that usually trades offroad capability for on-road handling ability — that’s only matched by the Ridgeline.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Explorer Sport Trac gets a standard trailer-sway control system and satellite radio. It also receives a new standard SOS-Post Crash Alert System, which unlocks the doors and activates the horn and emergency flashers when airbags are deployed.\n\nExterior\nThe Explorer Sport Trac wears the same slatted grille and scalloped headlights as the Explorer, but adds nearly 17 inches in length to accommodate a 4.5-foot pickup bed replete with side rails, tie-down hooks, a composite liner and three in-floor storage containers. It’s 210.2 inches long and 73.7 inches wide, which is similar to its competitors.\n\nAvailable 16-, 17-, 18- or 20-inch alloy wheels\nStandard power mirrors\nStandard power rear sliding window\nKeyless entry system with keypad standard on Limited\nHeated mirrors standard on Limited\nAutomatic headlamps standard on Limited\nOptional moonroof\n\nInterior\nDashboard components mimic the Explorer: A tall center stack has radio controls above the air vents and connects to a floor-mounted console box below. Front bucket seats and a second-row bench provide seating for up to five. The bed’s cargo volume is 37.5 cubic feet, which is more than the Frontier, equal to the Dakota and less than the Ridgeline.\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio and cruise controls\nStandard power windows and locks\nOptional Sync system (standard on Limited)\nOptional DVD navigation system on Limited\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike the Ridgeline, the Explorer Sport Trac has an independent rear suspension, which is rare for a truck. When properly equipped, the rear-wheel-drive V-8-powered Explorer Sport Trac can tow up to 7,160 pounds.\n\n210-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-6 with 254 pounds-feet of torque\n292-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 with 315 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed (V-6) or six-speed automatic (V-8) transmission\nAvailable 4×2 and 4×4 driveline options for both engines\n\nSafety\nTrailer-sway control works with the standard stability system to either apply the brakes or adjust engine response to help keep the trailer in line. Other safety features include:\n\nStandard front side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability control\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard SOS-Post Crash Alert System\nOptional reverse sensing system\nOptional power-adjustable pedals",
