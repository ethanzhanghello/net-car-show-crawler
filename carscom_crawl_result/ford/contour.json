      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nContour, a front-wheel-drive sedan that is smaller than the Taurus may have a short future. Production of the similar Mercury Mystique ends Dec.23, and the Kansas City, Mo., plant that builds the Mystique and Contour will convert to production of a new car-based sport utility vehicle.\n\nProduction of the 2000 Contour will continue at a Ford plant in Mexico, but the company has not said for how long or in what volume. Industry observers predict the Contour will disappear at the end of the model year.\n\nContour and Mystique debuted in the United States as 1995 models, derived from the European Ford Mondeo under a $6 billion program to design and build cars for global markets.\n\nHowever, the car was more successful in Europe than in the United States. The Contour’s interior size was too close to the smaller Escort’s, while the price was too close to the larger Taurus’. The new Ford Focus has a larger interior and a smaller price than Contour.\n\nExterior\nContour comes only in conservative four-door styling. The sporty SVT version is more noticeable because of its front air dam, round fog lamps, side sill extensions and 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat five, but the rear seat is surprisingly short of legroom for a car with a 106.5-inch wheelbase. A split, folding rear seat augments the 14-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 125-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is the base engine and a 2.5-liter, V-6 with 170 horsepower is optional on the Contour. The high-performance SVT Contour uses a fortified version of the V-6 with 200 horsepower and has a stiffer suspension and larger tires.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The Ford Contour has been a work in progress since its introduction in 1995. That is, the car has been in a constant state of correction. There were seat readjustments to create more legroom, suspension rearrangements to provide better ride and handling, exterior tweaks to mute its jelly-bean look, and changes to help the instrument panel make more sense.\n\nFord prefers to call those fixes “improvements,” things done in the normal course of product development. Perhaps. But it is also true that most of those “improvements” came in direct response to customer complaints.\n\nThat should be a cause for celebration instead of an occasion for corporate euphemisms. People complained. Ford responded by making the fixes. The upshot is that the tested 1999 Ford Contour SE is the Contour that Ford should have made in the beginning.\n\nHad Ford done things right the first time, the company wouldn’t be struggling today to boost the sagging sales of the Contour and its mechanical twin, the Mercury Mystique. Both cars, as currently constituted, easily compete against the Acura Integra, Mazda 626, Nissan Altima, Mitsubishi Galant and Dodge Stratus, the Contour’s main rivals in the compact sedan category.\n\nBut getting consumers to believe that the Contour now is up to snuff is going to take some work. People are funny. They walk away when you mess with them on something as important to their daily lives as a car. And when they walk away, it’s hard to get them to come back.\n\nThat’s too bad, because the first Contours were decent, despite their shortcomings. The key difference between them and the newest Contours is that the new cars seem to be designed and assembled with more attention to detail.\n\nTake those seats. There was little usable legroom for rear passengers in the older Contours, and if those passengers were, say, nearly six feet tall, they had to scrunch their legs to fit.\n\nFord corrected that problem by reconfiguring the front seats, taking the bulk out of them in a way that adds about a half-inch more space for the knees and 1.2 inches more overall for the legs of rear-seat passengers.\n\nConventional wisdom would say that driver and front-passenger seating comfort were sacrificed in the process. But that would be an erroneous assumption. Truth is, those lighter front seats are more comfortable, and more supportive of adult bottoms and backs, than the fatter seats they replaced.\n\nI noticed something else — the absence of notchiness in the five-speed manual gearbox in the new Contour. It’s relatively smooth shifting all around, with improved clutch work to boot. (Those of you who complained to me about fighting with the gears in the older Contours might want to give this one a try.)\n\nAs was the case in previous models, Ford is offering two engines in the 1999 Contour. My favorite is the tested 2.5-liter, 24-valve Duratec V-6, designed to produce 170 horsepower at 6,250 rpm and 165 pound-feet of torque at 4,250 rpm.\n\nA more economica l, 125-horsepower, 2-liter, four-cylinder Zetec engine is available. But that engine feels like an economy job, something that belongs in a smaller Ford Escort.\n\nThe five-speed manual transmission is standard on the front-wheel-drive Contour, which is available as the LX, the more upscale SE and the truly hot Contour SVT sport model. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is optional.\n\nFord sold 151,060 Contours last year, down 13.3 percent from the 174,187 models sold the previous year. The company would like to do better than that. The new Contour should help.\n\n1999 Ford Contour SE\n\nComplaints: The air conditioner in the test car seemed to work best at the extremes, which usually meant uncomfortably chill. Raising the temperature produced mugginess. I drove a lot with the windows down.\n\nPraise: Excellent build quality. Good highway performance. Easy shifting. An overall pleasant driving experience.\n\nRide, acceleration and han dlin g: High marks all around. The car is a spirited runner that doesn’t work you to death. Handled well in numerous close urban encounters. Accelerated with competence in highway lane changes. Excellent braking. Brakes in the tested Contour SE were power four-wheel discs with an optional four-wheel anti-lock system.\n\nHead-turning quotient: There are some automotive designs that just don’t catch on, and I think this is one of them. It drew a few favorable comments, mostly about its sporty wheels. But people generally ignored it. Not a single “Wow!” in a week’s worth of driving.\n\nSafety: Standard, federally required safety items such as dual front air bags and side-impact protection systems.\n\nSound system: AM-FM stereo radio and cassette. Installed by Ford. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested 1999 SE is $15,955. Dealer’s invoice is $14,565. Price as tested is $17,490, including $1,000 in options and a $535 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Excellent value. Now one of the best family compacts available. You should be able to bargain on this one.",

      "expert_review": "About a year ago, we were motoring through a California hamlet at a previewof the then all-new Ford Contour replacement for the old Ford Tempo.\n\nNice car, we recall, until venturing into the back seat, where space wassomewhat limited. It wasn’t real comfortable, we remember, but then you didn’thave all that much room to roam in a Tempo, either. In fact, Tempo was as oldas dirt while Contour was vibrant and alive and sported a fresh newaerodynamic look.\n\nOne of the Contours we drove was the SE with the 2.5-liter, V-6, automaticand top-of-the-line suspension. We recall it reminded us of a miniature TaurusSHO.\n\nContour was launched with fanfare in 1995, but stumbled at the gate. Themedia made much ado about rear-seat room. Ford was criticized so much for alack of rear-seat space you’d think the only reason folks bought a Contour wasto hop in the back seat and be scrunched.\n\nMany members of the media missed the point. Contour is much more appealingthan the stodgy Tempo. Even if Contour didn’t have a back seat, it would stillbe more pleasant than Tempo. Contour proves that economy cars don’t have tolook cheap. Contour has a luxury flair to it. Pleasant styling, good economy,decent price. Unfortunately, many members of the media saw how good the carlooked and expected it to offer the room, comfort and performance of aContinental. It doesn’t; it was never meant to.\n\nWe recall an episode in Dearborn at Ford’s test track when the companyintroduced Tempo with four-wheel-drive and dared the media to drive the carinto a sand pit, stop when the sand got rocker panel deep and drive out of thepit. We did as asked, except the car would not proceed forward. A tow truckhad to be called. Ford immediately halted the sand pit demonstration.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nFor 1996 Ford listened to its critics, revised the seat design in Contourand came up with one more inch in back. It doesn’t feel like Ford has added atennis court in back, but the one inch makes for a noticeable improvement.\n\nWe tested the Contour SE with the 2.5-liter, 170-h.p., V-6 engine and5-speed manual. A peppy powerplant with a smooth-shifting manual and goodmileage–21 m.p.g. city/31 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe SE sedan we tested starts at $16,170. Add $1,870 for a preferredequipment package including air conditioning, power locks, power windows,speed control; $190 for remote keyless entry, $330 for power driver’s seat;and $570 for ABS plus $510 for freight and you are still less than $20,000.\n\nDual air bags are standard, but as with Taurus, ABS is an option to keepthe sticker price down, a sad marketing ploy when consumers are demandingsafety.",

      "expert_review": "Ford officials must be absolutely stunned at the chilly reception the new Ford Contour and its sibling, the Mercury Mystique, have received since arriving in showrooms last fall.\n\nAfter a weeklong test drive of the Contour – and last year’s test of a Mystique – I’m convinced these two all-new cars are far and away the best automobiles Ford has ever built. But U.S. buyers have not warmed up to them. Inventories are bloated and the factory is scaling back production.\n\nAcross the pond in Europe, where the Contour/Mystique is sold as the Ford Mondeo, the opposite is happening. Production has been increased to meet heavy demand for the vehicle. Through January, Ford has sold 679,617 Mondeos since the car first went on sale there two years ago.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nFirst, some auto analysts have speculated that there may be some confusion about the Contour/Mystique in relation to the discontinued Tempo/Topaz.\n\nFord officials will tell you that the Contour and Mystique are not replacements for the Tempo and Topaz. The new cars are completely different from the ground up, engines and all. And they carry a far higher price tag than the Tempo and Topaz.\n\nPrice might be a big part of the problem. Ford has been advertising the Contour and Mystique as having prices starting in the $14,000 to $15,000 range, but until very recently the factory has only been building fully loaded cars – models that sticker out at $20,000 or more. Potential buyers who show up at the dealer expecting a $14,000 Contour or Mystique leave disappointed.\n\nTwenty-grand prices former Tempo/Topaz buyers out of the market and steers others to the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, two larger cars that can be bought or leased for less than the Contour/Mystique.\n\nIn other words, Ford has more problems than a calculus book.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably the best time to negotiate a deal for either the Contour or the Mystique.\n\nIn the fall, an all-new and more expensive Taurus and Sable will be out, and Ford’s pricing problems likely will be solved. By that time Contour and Mystique inventories probably will be under control, and Ford will have a more balanced mix of cars available. Also, there will be less pressure on Ford to move out cars that have been sitting around.\n\nIf you are interested in a Honda Accord/Mazda 626/Nissan Altima/Mitsubishi Galant-type car, this is your chance to take advantage of Ford’s marketing blunders.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Contour is available with either a 2.0-liter, 125-horsepower, four-cylinder engine with 16 valves or a 2.5-liter, 170-horsepower V-6with 24 valves. Both engines can be ordered with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual.\n\nOur test car was outfitted with the drivetrain that performance-oriented drivers likely would buy – the V-6 and five-speed. One enthusiast magazine tested a car similar to ours and logged a 0-to-60 mph time of 7.4 seconds. Those numb ers place the Contour at the head of its class.\n\nFrom the minute you twist the key, you realize that Ford engineers met the challenge to do their best work on the Contour. The V-6 engine is impeccably smooth, quiet and powerful.\n\nIt pulls strongly from a stop and delivers a solid burst of power all the way up to its 6,500 rpm red line.\n\nFord says the V-6, which it calls Duratec (short for durable technology), can go 100,000 miles without needing anything more than regular oil and filter changes.\n\nThe manual transmission in our test car made the vehicle fun to drive. The clutch was smooth and easy to operate, and the shifter clicked cleanly into each gear. The shift lever has a small round spring-loaded button that you must pull up before you can shift into reverse.\n\nThis item, called a lockout, is not a new idea, but it is one I don’t see on many new cars. It’s an excellent feature that prevents you from accidentally moving the lever into reverse.\n\nBecause t e Contour’s V-6 is so strong, you find that you don’t have to shift quite a s often as you might in other cars. The Contour can easily accelerate without lugging at slow speeds. Several times I left the transmission in third gear while going 20 mph, and each time the car galloped back up to speed.\n\nAll in all, the V-6-equipped Contour runs with the finesse and refinement of a Lincoln.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThere is no doubt that the Contour’s powerful and refined drivetrain is impressive. But I think Ford engineers really set the standard for compacts with the Contour’s superb four-wheel independent suspension system, strong power-assisted, four-wheel disc brakes and precise rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nThis sedan is an absolute joy to drive – if you like a firm and sporty BMW-like ride. Our Contour LX, the middle-of-the-line model, rode and handled like a four-door sports car.\n\nNo curve I could find (and I know of some good ones around here) proved too much for the Contour to handle. In emergency maneuvers, such as an abrupt turn, the Contour’s fat, 14-inch tires won’t squeal and the car’s body will not lean. This helps the driver maintain control of the vehicle under duress.\n\nAlso, there’s no play in the steering system. The Contour responds to your desires almost as if it is connected to your brain. One minor twitch of the wheel, for example, is all it takes to change lanes.\n\nOn V-6-equipped cars, four-wheel disc brakes are standard. The Contour’s ($800) optional anti-lock brakes haul the car to a stop effortlessly. Traction control comes standard with the ABS brakes.\n\nWhen the ABS system kicks in you don’t feel much characteristic pulsating at the pedal; the car stops in a straight line. However, the traction control system felt a bit touchy. Sometimes while I was driving around a corner and accelerating, the system would engage even though it didn’t feel as if either front wheel was losing traction.\n\nIn any case, these two safety features are worthwhile additions.\n\nThe Contour is very quiet over the road. You don’t hear much except the tires rolling over the pavement.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nI can’t recall a Ford vehicle that felt as tightly assembled as the Contour. By nearly any standard of measure, this is a quality vehicle.\n\nFrom the smoothly applied, glossy paint to the tight-fitting interior and exterior panels, the Contour has Germanic built-to-last feel.\n\nThere are, however, a few switches and buttons that seem poorly placed.\n\nOur test car came with power that moved the seat up and down as well back and forth. However, the switch for the seats is on the lower left portion of the seat frame. It’s a bit awkward to reach. Thankfully, the seat is not something that one adjusts every day.\n\nThe rear bench seatbacks can be folded forward to allow large items to fit inside the car. However, the seatback releases for the rear seats – there’s one on either side – ar e inside the trunk and hard to reach.\n\nOtherwise, the interior – aside from being a bit snug – is stylish, cleanly designed and attractive.\n\nThe cloth-covered bucket seats in our test car were exceptionally comfortable on long trips, though some may find them a bit firm.\n\nFrom the outside the Contour looks similar to a Mazda 626 or a Nissan Altima, but on the inside it is unique.\n\nThe Contour comes with an easy-to-read set of white-on-black analog gauges. The dash is a curvaceous piece of architecture that gives the Contour a bit of character and style.\n\nInterior room has been one of the major complaints. Rear legroom and foot room is tight. Our sunroof-equipped car also didn’t have much headroom.\n\nStill, when it comes to details, the Contour is a winner. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is thickly padded, and it feels great. All the important switches are lighted and easy to find at night.\n\nOur car came with radio-controlled door locks and built-in fogli hts, two classy features for a compact.\n\nIn more than 350 miles I didn’t hear one untoward noise, and all the car’s accessories functioned perfectly.\n\nThe only item that our test car didn’t have was a tilt steering wheel.\n\nIf you are interested in a V-6-powered car the size of a Honda Accord, make sure to add the Ford Contour and its close relative, the Mercury Mystique, to your list of cars to test-drive.\n\nTruett’s tip: In terms of mechanical refinement, handling and quality, the Ford Contour is probably the best vehicle in its class. However, the interior is a bit snug, and the sticker price is likely to cause a severe jolt.",

      "expert_review": "As I stood in the darkened shopping center parking lot waiting for the truck driver to load the red SVT Contour into his covered transporter for its final trip back to Detroit, I felt like a dad sending his kid off to college. Only the Contour wouldn’t come back.\n\nFord agreed to an extended-use evaluation of the car because living with one reveals much more than a week-long test drive. Its tenure in our household had expired, and it was heading back to the motor city where it would be scrapped. That’s right, a perfectly good automobile had come to the end of its line. This specific car, a hand-assembled prototype, built before actual production had begun, was not a “real” car and destined to have a limited life span.\n\nDid it represent a regular production car? If anything, it would be less reliable, less tight, but it was none of those things. I experienced not one problem.\n\nWaiting for it to enter the trailer was sad because this little hot rod and I had become fast friends in the last four months, thanks to its hyperactive V6 engine, 195 horsepower and a slick-shifting gearbox. In spite of its sedate profile and seats for four, this much-modified Contour, built exclusively at Ford’s Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, is more of a sports car than a family sedan. It is the perfect stealth-mobile because it looks much like the standard-issue Contour. Deeper fascias front and rear, dual exhausts, fog lights and five-spoke wheels are the only tip off that this is a special model.\n\nConsidering its price of $22,900, it is the performance bargain of the year. It romps through the gears with the kind of enthusiasm usually found only in high-dollar European sports sedans. Head out to the countryside and it tracks through twisty two lanes like a Beagle nosing a rabbit’s scent. It follows your lead like it is telepathic.\n\nHow did this jewel come to fruition? The gearheads at Ford SVT (Special Vehicle Team) snared Ford’s European-bred Contour, tweaked its handling, added more power, bolted in leather seats and slipped fat tires on 16-inch wheels, creating a bargain-basement BMW with a 143-mph top speed. Their job is to create limited-production models that appeal to driving enthusiasts, and I think this one adheres to their philosophy of balanced performance even better than the Mustang Cobra. They plan to build about 5,000 of them.\n\nThe heart and soul of the SVT Contour is its engine and gearbox. The standard 2.5-liter Duratec V6 is a nice unit when stock, but SVT bumped its horsepower up to 195 by adding a larger throttle body, lighter flywheel, conical air filter, larger radiator, oil cooler and higher compression pistons. Ford says its 76.6 horsepower-per-liter output is the highest of any engine manufactured in North America.\n\nThe SVT is one of the sweetest-shifting cars I can remember. The lightened flywheel lets the engine rev quickly, and the cable shift linkage has been revised for a more direct feel. With a little concentration you can match your shifts so perfectly that passengers might think they’re riding in an automatic, a fact pointed out by some friends riding in the back seat one night.\n\nFortunately, these friends were not large, and they found the back seat acceptable for an hour-long ride. Lack of space in back is one of the Contour’s only drawbacks. Even though the back seat was configured to add a couple more inches of kneeroom for 1997, it is still fairly snug. I put in a child safety seat it touched the front seat backs. Rows of vertical padding provide shoulder support but interfere slightly with the installation of a child seat.\n\nFolding the back seat forward opened up enough space to carry a bicycle inside.\n\nThe front seats are heavily padded buckets whose backs grasp your body like a reassuring hand. The seat bottoms, however, came up short in the way of under-thigh support, an irritant magnified by a five-hour drive.\n\nOtherwise, lon drives were a delight. Directional stability and long legs mean you can keep up with traffic on the interstate no matter how fast it is going.\n\nStopping is as important as going fast, and the SVT’s large front brakes are reassuring because of excellent feel and directional stability. A four-channel anti-lock system is standard.\n\nThe Z-rated tires that hang on so tightly in turns were a tad noisy on some pavement surfaces but their grip more than outweighs the noise.\n\nAll SVT Contours have dark blue leather interiors that are not only tasteful but comfortable. The thick, padded steering wheel is pleasing to your hands, and the gearshift is placed for easy use. Large cupholders have been molded into the floor console, and while they are not ideal they are much better than the ones on the original. The storage bin in the console is quite small.\n\nEven though the radio is Ford’s old style, with too many similarly sized flat buttons, it was tolerable because SVT put their money into improving performance first. Sound quality was excellent.\n\nSlick little “eyeball” lights in the ceiling can be adjusted for reading maps or directions at night.\n\nTraveling at night on country roads magnified the need for better, brighter headlights. Even with the “brights” on I wished for more reach and a sharper pattern at highway speeds.\n\nWhen I first experienced an SVT Contour earlier this year in the vastness of Death Valley, Calif., I called it “a taste of Wienerschnitzel from the land of barbecue.” After living with it for four months that seems even more accurate. It has the high-speed manners of a car developed on the autobahn, yet it comes right from our city at a price that is thousands of dollars less than the cars it compares to. An impressive accomplishment.\n\nThis and other SVT cars are sold only through the 700 authorized SVT dealers. To find the dealer nearest to you call 1-800-FORD-SVT.\n\nThe base price was $22,900. Our test car was equipped with a power moonroof and compact disc player, bringing its sticker price to $23,635.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Snick the gear shift through all five speeds, accompanied by the snarl of its slick V6, and you understand what the SVT Contour is all about: European sports-sedan feel, tenacious road holding and great brakes at a price that undercuts its competition by thousands.\n\nCounterpoint: The back seat is fairly small, headlights could be better and the front seats need more under-thigh support.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 106.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,068 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $22,900\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $23,635\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 29 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "All cars have an emotional component, but some are harder to define than others. Not so Ford’s SVT Contour. It may be American, but it drives like a European sports sedan.\n\nThis mid-size four-door from Ford’s motoring boutique beckons with a sweet-revving V6, delightful gearchange and the character of a European sports sedan. And it does so with a base price of $22,900, thousands less than its competitors from BMW and Audi.\n\nEarlier this year I drove an SVT for part of a day and was captivated by its over-the-road skills during a banzai trip through the vast nothingness of Death Valley. But what’s it like in the real world of work commutes and trips to the grocery? Since it is built at the Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, we asked Ford to let us be foster parents for three months or so to see how it measures up in real life compared with a lively morning in the desert.\n\nNow we have a red one temporarily in our garage (black and silver are the other two colors). After experiencing such a high back in March, I figured the mornings after would be quite a letdown, but it has not been so to this point. Even after a couple of weeks with the test car, I tingle with anticipation every time I key its V6 to life. The combination of a rev-happy engine and a slick-shifting gearbox makes it a joy to work through the gears and reminds me of how I felt about my 1984 Volkswagen GTI. A quick stab of the throttle brings giggles from the exhaust as the engine leaps to its task, hitting 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. Believe it or not, this little car has a top track speed of 143 mph. Impressive, indeed, especially if it will actually do it.\n\nIt also feels a lot like a baby SHO Taurus, but it handles better. It is smaller, too, which is a drawback to those looking for a family hauler. More about that later.\n\nThe Special Vehicle Team (SVT), a small group of performance enthusiasts clustered inside Ford Motor Co., turn production cars into machines that will satisfy serious driving enthusiasts. Besides the Contour, they also build coupe and convertible versions of the Mustang Cobra.\n\nSVT volume is small to ensure exclusivity and because they appeal to a niche market. They plan to build about 5,000 SVT Contours.\n\nHow is the SVT different from a Contour SE? The interior gets fat, thickly padded leather seats and white-faced instrumentation. The only interior color is dark blue.\n\nLooking at the exterior, you might think that most of the modifications are cosmetic, but in fact just the opposite is true. The lower front spoiler with fog lights, side skirts and deeper rear valance are only the tip of the iceberg. The best part is what you can’t see, like more horsepower, bigger brakes, tighter handling, grippy seats and the ability to charge down bumpy roads without losing grip.\n\nThe 2.5-liter Duratec engine is a gem in its own right, but SVT’s modifications make it world class. Horsepower jumps to 195, thanks to a lighte r flywheel, larger throttle body, conical air filter, larger radiator, oil cooler and higher compression pistons. Its 76.6 horsepower-per-liter output is the highest of any engine manufactured in North America.\n\nNot only does it zip through the gears, but it pulls authoritatively in high gear on the highway. On our first road trip, a cross-state outing to St. Louis, it hammered along at an impressive rate and got 25 mpg. The engine has ample power for passing without having to shift down to fourth. The tight suspension and fat, 16-inch tires have impressive grip, yet don’t pound the passengers with a punishing ride on a choppy highway. The compliant ride is very European.\n\nUltimate handling may lack a little, but short of high-speed thrashes on a racetrack, the SVT is very self-assured when the road gets twisty.\n\nThere are some things I didn’t like:\n\nThe headlights need a better pattern, especially on low beams. Brighter lights would be even better.\n\nThe back seat, although it now has nearly two more inches of kneeroom than before, is still snug for a family car.\n\nThe radio is fairly cryptic to use, although once you have it figured out it is not too bad. The folks at SVT acknowledge the problem but say they would rather put the money into other areas at this time and hold the price down.\n\nThe bottom seat cushion is just not wide enough. I got a cramp in my knee after four hours at the wheel.\n\nSome good things:\n\nThe ventilated disc brakes stop straight and true. Anti-lock is standard.\n\nThe split-folding rear seat has release handles in the trunk so you don’t have to crawl inside to unlatch.\n\nSteering is light, direct and immediate. The thick, leather-wrapped wheel feels good.\n\nWire mesh is used inside the grille and openings in the front and rear spoiler, which gives a subtle hot rod look.\n\nThe bigger front headlights and oval grille brighten up the car’s face considerably.\n\nWell, that’s it for the first couple weeks. We’ll check back in the fall to let you know how things are going.\n\nThere are only 700 authorized SVT dealers. To find the dealer nearest to you call 1-800-FORD-SVT.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price is $22,900. Our test car was equipped with a power moonroof and compact disc player, bringing its sticker price to $23,635.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: A great engine, smooth shifting and excellent road holding make the SVT Contour a delight for the enthusiast driver. It is priced right too.\n\nCounterpoint: A complicated radio, narrow front seat cushions and headlights that could be better are my main complaints.",
