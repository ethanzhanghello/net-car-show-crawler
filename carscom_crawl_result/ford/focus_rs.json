      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe onetime top-selling car in the world will also now be among the fastest. The first U.S. offering of the Ford Focus RS arrives with a vengeance — boasting a 4.7-second zero-to-62-mph sprint and top speed of 165 mph. Those specs come courtesy of the performance-oriented RS’ 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, which cranks out 350 horsepower and as many pounds-feet of torque, channeled through the Ford Performance all-wheel-drive system and unleashed with the help of launch-control technology.\n\nThe Focus will be the first RS model to feature launch control, Ford said. “The driver selects launch control from the cluster menu, engages first gear, applies full throttle and releases the clutch,” the automaker explained in a statement. “The system then delivers optimum drive — including distributing torque through the all-wheel-drive system, maintaining maximum torque using the turbo overboost function, managing traction control and setting the dampers.”\n\nA light in the instrument cluster alerts the driver of the best time to upshift, and flashes a warning if the engine hits max rpm. Four driver-selectable modes — Normal, Sport, Track and Drift — elicit different performance responses and exhaust notes for different milieus, from the road to the track.\n\nThe RS’ EcoBoost engine is based on the one in the Mustang. The fastest Focus is roughly a second slower to 60 mph than the current fastest-estimated Mustang, the naturally aspirated 2016 Shelby GT350R; then again, it’s also roughly $12,000 cheaper at a starting price of around $37,000.",

      "expert_review": "The 2017 Ford Focus RS hatchback has a singular… well, focus: Drive fast. And it accomplishes that mission, but it does so at the expense of most other attributes.\n\nThe Focus RS made its debut in 2016, the first of Ford’s RS models to make it to American shores in a long while. But now, thanks to Ford’s new global emphasis, what’s made here is sold everywhere and vice versa. And after driving the Focus RS, I’m glad it’s finally made the jump across the pond.\n\nThe 2017 Ford Focus RS returns without any notable changes for the new model year. Compare the 2017 version with last year’s model here.\n\nEven with the mothballing of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, we’ve suddenly stumbled from a performance-compact desert to an oasis of rally-inspired options. Competing with the Focus RS for hot-hatch stardom are the Volkswagen Golf R, Subaru WRX STi and the forthcoming 2018 Honda Civic Type R that’s expected this spring. Compare the Focus RS with the Golf R and WRX STi here.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in my week with the Focus RS, from winding mountain roads to the traffic-clogged arteries of Los Angeles. And just as speed can vary on those freeways, so did my feelings about the RS.\n\nFlashy Styling\n\nThe Ford Focus RS comes with plenty of exterior styling enhancements that ensure it will never, ever, never-ever-ever be confused with a regular Focus. It certainly looks the part of a hot hatch, with a unique grille up front that has large openings to feed more air to the engine and help cool the front brakes. Out back is a large body-colored spoiler and an aggressive rear diffuser integrating dual exhaust pipes. Nineteen-inch wheels come standard in several available designs, while a set of 18-inch wheels wrapped in winter tires is offered for those who live in colder climates.\n\nPowertrain\n\nThe beating heart of the Focus RS is a turbocharged, 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine. It’s shared with the Ford Mustang, but extensive modifications here including a twin-scroll turbocharger, beefed-up cooling systems and a high-flow head. Together, they boost the engine’s output to a hearty 350 horsepower and 350 pounds-feet of torque and push its redline to a higher 6,900 rpm. There’s only one transmission, and it will please old-school enthusiasts: a six-speed manual.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy is 19/25/22 mpg city/highway/combined, and premium gas is required. Good luck hitting those figures, though; this car invites you (more like begs you) to drive like a bit of a maniac.\n\nOn a Twisty Road\n\nThe shocks have two modes, Normal and Sport, the latter of which stiffens them up noticeably. A small button on the turn-signal stalk allows the driver to adjust suspension stiffness and keep all other drive settings constant in any mode. I’d recommend using the dampers in Sport only on well-maintained roads with even surfaces; any sort of rough pavement or potholes get immediately translated through the seat and rattle your brain a bit.\n\nGet the Focus RS on a good road with twists, where it can stretch its legs a bit, and it is an absolute joy. The suspension keeps it amazingly flat in the corners (especially with the dampers in Sport), there’s oodles of grip from the wide tires, and the whole car is set up to be fast, responsive and visceral. Once the road straightens out, though, all that tautness tells a different story.\n\nHow It Drives in Traffic\n\nIt’s as if the Ford Focus RS is overly communicative: It wants you to know what’s going on around you at all times and doesn’t let you relax as a driver or passenger. That’s a good thing when you want to have some fun, but it’s just annoying in any kind of traffic or on a road that’s not well-paved. Road noise is omnipresent.\n\nLow-Rent Interior\n\nThe Focus RS I drove came equipped with a $2,785 RS2 Package that added a powered driver’s seat, heated front seats and steering wheel, navigation and — most interestingly — leather-trimmed Recaro sport seats. The sport seats are heavily bolstered; that’s welcome when it comes to keeping the driver in place but makes it hard for larger individuals to fit. While I could stand to lose a few pounds, I’m not that big (or so I hope), but if I were any bigger, they would have been uncomfortable.\n\nConclusion\n\nPut up against its two competitors, the Focus RS is the sharpest instrument. It’s faster, corners harder and has a higher performance ceiling than the Golf R or WRX STi. But if I had to drive one of those cars on a daily basis, I’m not sure the RS is the one I’d take. The Golf R rides better and has a much nicer interior, while the WRX STi splits the difference between the two.\n\nIf you can live with its foibles, the Ford Focus RS’ rewards are great. It’s a connected driving experience that many cars aspire to but can’t deliver. I hate how much I loved it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
