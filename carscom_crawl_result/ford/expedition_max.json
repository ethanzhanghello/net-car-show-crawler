      "expert_review": "Is the Ford Expedition a Good SUV?\n\nFord’s updated 2025 Expedition is meant for a new generation of families, ones more technology savvy and adventurous, and it excels in its mission to bring change to a staid vehicle class.\n\nHow Does the Ford Expedition Compare With Other Full-Size SUVs?\n\nIt’s more spacious than foreign-brand full-size SUVs and rides and drives better than domestic competitors, but its novel dash layout might turn off some buyers who don’t care for the new design aesthetic.\n\nIf we wait long enough, change comes for us all, and it seems that the Ford Expedition’s number is up in that regard. With the traditional buyers that made the Expo a smash hit 30 years ago now aging out of the market, Ford decided it was time to update its big full-size family SUV for a new generation of family use. And while the overall shape might look very similar to the outgoing model, the interior has been thoroughly rethought for the modern age — one where screens take precedence over styling, where connectivity and apps are a priority, and where getting well off the beaten path has taken on a new urgency. The 2025 Expedition’s radically new interior is sure to alienate traditional buyers, but it will certainly excite a new generation of Expedition owners. But how does it work? And does the Expedition’s new mission make sense?\n\nRelated: 2025 Ford Expedition: Split (Gate) Personality\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 Ford Expedition Cost?\n\nFor 2025, Ford has rejiggered the trims available on the Expedition, eliminating a lot of the lower-cost, lesser-contented trims in favor of a simpler lineup that comes very well equipped. Gone are the XL, XLT, Limited and Timberline trims; the lineup now consists of the base Active, upgraded Platinum, off-road Tremor and top-of-the-line King Ranch. All starting prices below include a stunning $1,995 destination fee; the Active, Platinum and King Ranch are all available in extended-length Expedition Max form for an additional $3,000.\n\nActive: $63,995\nPlatinum: $76,425\nTremor: $83,025\nKing Ranch: $85,650\n\nWith the elimination of the lower-priced trims, the entry price for a 2025 Expedition has jumped by more than $7,000; Ford says that this doesn’t really matter much, as most buyers tended to option up the base ‘24 Expeditions anyway. This new slimmed-down trim strategy reduces build combinations and options, improving profitability by reducing complexity. The Active trim comes with standard rear-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive; all other trims come with standard 4WD.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Ford Expedition Drive?\n\nI sampled a couple of versions of the Expedition on my 36-hour jaunt to Louisville, Ky., where the Expedition is built in a massive Ford factory alongside the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Super Duty pickups. I drove a standard-wheelbase King Ranch for an extended on-road test, a Platinum Max for a long highway jaunt and a Tremor for some significant off-roading. The common thread among all of them is the exceptional powertrain. The standard version of the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine makes 400 horsepower and 480 pounds-feet of torque, and it is more than adequate to get the Expedition flying with an accompanying roar when the go-pedal is pressed. In fact, that roar sounds nothing like a turbocharged V-6, but suspiciously like a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8 … making us call shenanigans on Ford for piping in artificial engine sounds. But we’ll give their engineers a pass on this one because the engine delivers its power in a stunning rush that launches everyone back into their seats. The high-output version of this engine is standard in the Tremor and optional in the Platinum as part of a couple of packages, and while it boosts output to 440 hp and 510 pounds-feet of torque, it’s also highly unnecessary — the standard engine is beyond adequate.\n\nWhat it is not, however, is terribly efficient. My drive averaged between 15-21 mpg, depending on whether I was on highways or backroads, but overall, it’s still a thirsty powertrain. Two-wheel-drive models are EPA-rated 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined, while 4×4 versions are rated 15/22/18 mpg, which is pretty much spot on for what we saw from the Expedition’s trip computer.\n\nThe automatic transmission bangs off shifts quickly and crisply, but you’ll find that it’s shifting a lot — it has 10 forward gears to play with, and it intends to play with them all. The ride quality is also exceptional on-road, especially if your Expedition is fitted with the continuously controlled dampers, Ford’s electronically controlled shock absorbers that do an excellent job of ironing out uneven pavement and isolating potholes. Steering feel is good, as well, with just the right amount of effort and feedback for a big SUV. You won’t be attacking canyon curves with eager enthusiasm in the Expedition, but you won’t be making your passengers sick due to a soft and wallowy suspension, either. The only part of the driving experience that gave me pause was the Expedition’s brakes — they’re incredibly sensitive and grabby in every version I tried, responding to slight presses with major responses. It takes a while to get used to them in order to drive smoothly.\n\nGoin’ Muddin’? Try the Tremor\n\nThe prior off-road version of the Expedition, the Timberline, was capable in its own way, but the new Tremor aims to improve upon that. Featuring real and proper underbody protection, chunky all-terrain tires on 18-inch wheels, an electronic locking rear differential, special off-road modes, a uniquely tuned suspension, cameras galore and a few other tricks that include one-pedal off-road driving, it’s built to go farther afield than prior versions of the Expo. And after driving it on a serious off-road course in rural Indiana just days after tons of rain had made everything slick and gooey, I can endorse its abilities in the muck.\n\nIt’s still a big SUV with all of the limitations that size can bring, like poor outward visibility, the inability to squeeze into super-tight spaces and bulk that just can’t be hidden. But Ford’s judicious use of strategic cameras to allow for forward and 360-degree visibility on the big screens are decidedly helpful. The extra power from the high-output version of the V-6 doesn’t really enter into the equation; off-roading in anything that doesn’t have a Raptor or TRX badge on it is usually done at lower speeds, where low-end torque and grip are better perks than outright power. The Tremor’s 3.73:1 final drive ratio and locking rear differential are much better features than the more powerful engine when out in the rough.\n\nBut just like the on-road trims of the Expedition that have one odd quirk (the grabby brakes), the off-road trim also comes with an oddity: The new shape of the Expedition’s steering wheel (it’s a flattened oval, or a “squircle” to some) makes off-roading a little unusual. Hand-over-hand motions feel odd, and rim-shuffling motions (you never want to hook your thumbs in the steering wheel when off-roading) are just as unusual, because whenever the wheel is slightly turned and you’re keeping your hands at the 9 and 3 o’clock positions, you’re suddenly holding a much narrower steering wheel than you were a moment prior. It’s not a deal killer by any means, but it will take some getting used to. But why does the Expedition even have such an oddly shaped steering wheel? Well, it kind of needs one …\n\nThat Radical New Interior\n\nBy far, the biggest change to the Expedition is its interior design. The new dashboard, center console and screens are a total departure from anything Ford has done in its truck lineup. Replacing the traditional gauge cluster behind the steering wheel is a 24-inch panoramic digital display located high up at the base of the windshield. A second 13.2-inch touchscreen located in the middle of the dash is your primary input means. With the steering wheel no longer a circle, you’re supposed to look over it instead of through it to see the panoramic display, much like the most recent Toyota Prius hybrid and bZ4X electric car. And just like in those Toyotas, some people will be fine with it, and some will not. Shorter drivers might find this new setup difficult to use, with the new panoramic screen cutting off some forward visibility. I personally had no problem with it and like having the screen high up in my field of view. It also eliminates the need for a head-up display, saving Ford some costs in the process.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the interior is subtly changed to help Ford cut costs. The company insists it’s just a design change aesthetic for a simpler, cleaner look, but consider what’s not here anymore: There are no buttons or switches for the headlights or steering-wheel adjustments. There are also no available massaging seats for front occupants. You adjust the steering-wheel position via touch-sensitive panels on the steering wheel, which activate corresponding icons in the digital display. The headlight controls are in the center multimedia screen. These are things that highlight how different the new Expedition is from the outgoing model, and even Ford recognizes that there’s going to be a learning curve for new customers to understand how to use it — there’s a Quick Tips app that gives you video tutorials, and dealers will be trained to show new buyers how to perform previously simple tasks. To Ford’s credit, however, none of these changes are really terribly complicated, and once you have a little practice with them, it shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThe new Ford Digital Experience is now in the Expedition, and it works as well here as it does in other vehicles I’ve sampled it in, such as the 2025 Ford Explorer. Like almost every other automaker it seems, Google has wormed its way into Ford’s infotainment system, and in the Expedition, it controls the voice command functions, mapping duties, peripheral app downloads and more. For full utilization, you must have a Ford Connectivity Package subscription — available either for a monthly fee or as a one-time, life-of-the-vehicle purchase (a one-year trial is included with the purchase of a new Expedition). The system uses Google Maps for native navigation, but you’re welcome to use your phone’s navigation functions through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. But to use the Wi-Fi hot spot or download apps directly to the SUV, that connectivity package is required.\n\n \n\nDigital changes aside, the Expedition is just as spacious and useful as ever — now perhaps more so with its nifty new Ford Split Gate rear end. Notice how all 2025 Expeditions have a black liftgate regardless of what color or trim the truck is? That’s because it’s split into two sections, like a BMW or Land Rover SUV. The upper part raises and lowers normally, but the lower section stays put unless you drop it. This is handy for opening the rear hatch on a slope so your 2-liter sodas or loose basketballs don’t roll out and onto the ground. The lower portion can also be used as a seating surface for tailgating, which further plays into the Expedition’s role as an all-around family funship.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Ford Expedition Up Close: Changing With the Times\n2025 Ford Expedition: Which Trim Level Should You Buy?\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nWhich Cars Fit 3 Car Seats?\nShop for a 2025 Ford Expedition Near You\nUtility Don’t Come Cheap\n\nWhile the Expedition might be an outstanding all-around family truckster able to haul people, cargo and up to 9,600 pounds of trailer, it’s not going to be accessible to most families due to its cost. As previously stated, the Expedition gets a significant price bump for 2025, but the entry-level Active trim does come with significant standard equipment, especially in the safety department. The 360-degree camera system, front and rear parking sensors, lane-centering steering and more all are part of the truck’s standard equipment, and Ford says that BlueCruise hands-free cruise control will be present on nearly 90% of all Expeditions, should you decide you want to pay for its activation (it’s another subscription-based service).\n\nThe Expedition still works as well as it ever has, with a formidable combination of utility, luxury, comfort and power. Its new interior will likely appeal to a younger generation of (affluent) families who value technology more highly, and for these buyers, the new Expo might be just what they’re looking for. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs vanquish those vans in the 1990s. Since then, however, the Great Recession and occasional gas price shocks have returned the largest SUVs to their original role in the market: expensive vehicles bought by people who need big, multi-passenger vehicles that can tow a lot of weight. The segment leaders are the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer sibling, the Suburban, and it isn’t hard to figure out why: Their main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade.\n\nNow all that has changed. Behold the behemoth: an all-new 2018 Ford Expedition that aims to knock the Chevy off its top-truck throne — as it did in our Full-Size SUV Challenge.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains traditional, trucklike body-on-frame construction. Under the skin, the Expedition is an F-150 enhanced with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower load floor in the cargo area, enabling the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s seats, which fold flat but not into the floor. The Tahoe’s raised floor eats into cargo space and makes it more difficult to load objects.\n\nLike the F-150, the Expedition’s body is now aluminum, but the weight difference for 2018 isn’t that significant — just a 119-pound decrease for the base trim versus a comparable 2017 Expedition. Ford added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that serve to offset some of the benefit of lightweight aluminum. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that’s much more in keeping with the modern style of truck: high beltline, smaller windows and chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Expedition comes in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max (formerly Expedition EL). The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space, but it does increase the cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity. My primary test vehicle was a regular-length Expedition, though Cars.com editors have also driven the Max.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a carryover engine. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission — available with either rear- or all-wheel drive — and an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6 and it sounds like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated through the stereo (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of whooshing turbos and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it powers.\n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — the V-6 more than adequately powers the Expedition in both regular and Max versions, and it gets even punchier when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exudes confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up steering feedback and changes both accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18 to 22 inches depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride, as well; there are no crazy, tippy body motions. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered there, too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nHooked up to a 5,500-pound camper, my Expedition towed like a champ, chugging up 6 percent inclines with ease, accelerating despite the load it hauled. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to the engine, holding gears on downhill grades to save the Expedition’s brakes and maintain easy control. The instrument panel also shows you tons of information, such as which gear the transmission’s in at any given time.\n\nTrailer sway control comes with a heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back up a trailer using a dedicated rotary knob on the dash and backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nWhere the Expedition falls short is in fuel economy, especially when towing. It also features a smaller gas tank than its main competition, meaning its overall range is notably shorter. The regular Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. The longer Expedition Max clocks in at 17/23/19 mpg with 2WD, 16/21/18 mpg with 4WD. In a recent real-world test for the Full-Size SUV Challenge, my Expedition 4WD achieved 21.5 mpg in combined driving, better than its 19 mpg rating. But that number dropped dramatically to 10.2 mpg when towing a camper — a steeper loss than the V-8-powered competitors in our Challenge exhibited, though still not the lowest mpg. Turns out that the twin-turbocharged engines positively suck down the petrol when you put the engine under some serious load, as I did up and down the hills of eastern Arizona. Combine that with the smaller gas tank, and you’ll be making frequent pit stops if you’re towing a trailer cross-country.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats feel unsupportive over longer voyages. One of our taller reviewers could not get comfortable, with his legs always at an angle and most of his thighs unsupported by the oddly short bottom cushions. The backseats are high, with plenty of room, and the ability to slide fore and aft means passengers in the two rear rows can negotiate legroom amongst themselves. The third row is usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; slide it forward a bit and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of a button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\nMaterials quality in the cabin is mixed. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in its own class; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t flow together well. Some of this, like plastic molding seams on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality, but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim and even top $70,000 for a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail is important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin, including gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big-screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids and autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is by the new B&O Play brand, a division of Bang & Olufsen, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nThe entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models on many levels and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness and amenities.\n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-size SUV in awhile, you’d better sit down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination charges, but you’ll never see that price on a dealer lot — they’re meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments.\n\nFar more likely to be found is an XLT trim, which starts at $52,985 with two-wheel drive. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,000 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop just short of 85 grand.\n\nMy regular-length Limited 4×4 model stickered at $72,655 including destination, and that included several popular equipment packages and leather for the first and second rows. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000 and can top out around $100,000.\n\nStill, the Expedition’s price is easily competitive with vehicles like the Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. It comes in at a bit more than the Nissan Armada, but it’s a significantly larger vehicle with a much bigger interior. It’s comparable in size to the Toyota Sequoia but has far surpassed that old, outdated model. It’s more refined, with a much nicer interior and a multimedia system that’s at least two or three generations more current.\n\nWith buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs vanquish those vans in the 1990s. Since then, however, the Great Recession and occasional gas price shocks have returned the largest SUVs to their original role in the market: expensive vehicles bought by people who need big, multi-passenger vehicles that can tow a lot of weight. The segment leaders are the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer sibling, the Suburban, and it isn’t hard to figure out why: Their main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade.\n\nNow all that has changed. Behold the behemoth: an all-new 2018 Ford Expedition that aims to knock the Chevy off its top-truck throne — as it did in our Full-Size SUV Challenge.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains traditional, trucklike body-on-frame construction. Under the skin, the Expedition is an F-150 enhanced with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower load floor in the cargo area, enabling the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s seats, which fold flat but not into the floor. The Tahoe’s raised floor eats into cargo space and makes it more difficult to load objects.\n\nLike the F-150, the Expedition’s body is now aluminum, but the weight difference for 2018 isn’t that significant — just a 119-pound decrease for the base trim versus a comparable 2017 Expedition. Ford added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that serve to offset some of the benefit of lightweight aluminum. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that’s much more in keeping with the modern style of truck: high beltline, smaller windows and chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Expedition comes in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max (formerly Expedition EL). The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space, but it does increase the cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity. My primary test vehicle was a regular-length Expedition, though Cars.com editors have also driven the Max.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a carryover engine. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission — available with either rear- or all-wheel drive — and an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6 and it sounds like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated through the stereo (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of whooshing turbos and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it powers.\n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — the V-6 more than adequately powers the Expedition in both regular and Max versions, and it gets even punchier when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exudes confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up steering feedback and changes both accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18 to 22 inches depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride, as well; there are no crazy, tippy body motions. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered there, too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nHooked up to a 5,500-pound camper, my Expedition towed like a champ, chugging up 6 percent inclines with ease, accelerating despite the load it hauled. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to the engine, holding gears on downhill grades to save the Expedition’s brakes and maintain easy control. The instrument panel also shows you tons of information, such as which gear the transmission’s in at any given time.\n\nTrailer sway control comes with a heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back up a trailer using a dedicated rotary knob on the dash and backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nWhere the Expedition falls short is in fuel economy, especially when towing. It also features a smaller gas tank than its main competition, meaning its overall range is notably shorter. The regular Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. The longer Expedition Max clocks in at 17/23/19 mpg with 2WD, 16/21/18 mpg with 4WD. In a recent real-world test for the Full-Size SUV Challenge, my Expedition 4WD achieved 21.5 mpg in combined driving, better than its 19 mpg rating. But that number dropped dramatically to 10.2 mpg when towing a camper — a steeper loss than the V-8-powered competitors in our Challenge exhibited, though still not the lowest mpg. Turns out that the twin-turbocharged engines positively suck down the petrol when you put the engine under some serious load, as I did up and down the hills of eastern Arizona. Combine that with the smaller gas tank, and you’ll be making frequent pit stops if you’re towing a trailer cross-country.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats feel unsupportive over longer voyages. One of our taller reviewers could not get comfortable, with his legs always at an angle and most of his thighs unsupported by the oddly short bottom cushions. The backseats are high, with plenty of room, and the ability to slide fore and aft means passengers in the two rear rows can negotiate legroom amongst themselves. The third row is usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; slide it forward a bit and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of a button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\nMaterials quality in the cabin is mixed. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in its own class; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t flow together well. Some of this, like plastic molding seams on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality, but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim and even top $70,000 for a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail is important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin, including gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big-screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids and autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is by the new B&O Play brand, a division of Bang & Olufsen, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nThe entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models on many levels and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness and amenities.\n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-size SUV in awhile, you’d better sit down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination charges, but you’ll never see that price on a dealer lot — they’re meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments.\n\nFar more likely to be found is an XLT trim, which starts at $52,985 with two-wheel drive. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,000 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop just short of 85 grand.\n\nMy regular-length Limited 4×4 model stickered at $72,655 including destination, and that included several popular equipment packages and leather for the first and second rows. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000 and can top out around $100,000.\n\nStill, the Expedition’s price is easily competitive with vehicles like the Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. It comes in at a bit more than the Nissan Armada, but it’s a significantly larger vehicle with a much bigger interior. It’s comparable in size to the Toyota Sequoia but has far surpassed that old, outdated model. It’s more refined, with a much nicer interior and a multimedia system that’s at least two or three generations more current.\n\nWith buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Ford Expedition?\n\nOffered in regular- and extended-length Max form, the Ford Expedition full-size SUV seats five people in two rows or up to eight people in three rows. It’s powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 375, 400 or 440 horsepower, depending on trim level. The V-6 teams with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the Toyota Sequoia and the Nissan Armada.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Ford Expedition?\n\nFollowing an extensive refresh for 2022, the Expedition carries over with no significant changes. The off-road-oriented Timberline trim gets Ford’s Trail 1-Pedal Drive — a type of cruise-control system for low-speed off-road driving — as standard equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Ford Expedition Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry with push-button start\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane-centering steering\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n12-inch touchscreen\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower running boards\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nPower-adjustable pedals with memory feature\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower third-row seat\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nHeated second-row seats\n15.5-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nSurround-view camera\nB&O premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nHands-free BlueCruise driver assist (Platinum trim)\nAdaptive suspension\nShould I Buy the 2023 Ford Expedition?\n\nThe Expedition has plenty of capability — it can tow up to 9,300 pounds when properly equipped — and it offers lots of tech features. It’s roomy, rides well and has a powerful drivetrain, too. It can get pricey, and towing disproportionately drags down fuel economy, but the Expedition is an impressive full-size SUV overall. Its list of available equipment is long, and the specialized features of the Timberline and Stealth Performance versions give them distinctive personalities and genuinely improved capabilities.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nOffered in regular- and extended-length Max form, the Ford Expedition full-size SUV seats five people in two rows or up to eight people in three rows. It’s powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 375 or 400 horsepower depending on the trim level. The V-6 teams with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada. \n\n What’s New on the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nA new two-row XL trim level is now the base model, and a new STX Package features a five-bar grille, tri-zone automatic air conditioning and an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Ford Expedition Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPush-button start\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower running boards\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nPower-adjustable pedals with memory feature\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nPower third-row seat\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated second-row seats\nNavigation\nB&O premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2021 Ford Expedition?\n\nThe Expedition has plenty of capability — it’ll tow up to 9,300 pounds when properly equipped — and it offers lots of tech features. It’s roomy, rides well and has a powerful drivetrain, too. It can get pricey and towing disproportionately drags down fuel economy, but the Expedition is an impressive full-size SUV overall.",

The V-6 teams with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and rear- and four-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the Toyota Sequoia and the Nissan Armada. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ford Expedition?\n\nThe Expedition gets minor tweaks for 2024, including front tow hooks being added to the Heavy-Duty Trailer Tow Package on select 4×4 models.

      "expert_review": "Just as minivans replaced the family station wagon in the 1980s, so too did big SUVs vanquish those vans in the 1990s. Since then, however, the Great Recession and occasional gas price shocks have returned the largest SUVs to their original role in the market: expensive vehicles bought by people who need big, multi-passenger vehicles that can tow a lot of weight. The segment leaders are the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer sibling, the Suburban, and it isn’t hard to figure out why: Their main competitor, the Ford Expedition, hadn’t seen a major update in almost a decade.\n\nNow all that has changed. Behold the behemoth: an all-new 2018 Ford Expedition that aims to knock the Chevy off its top-truck throne — as it did in our Full-Size SUV Challenge.\n\nOld-School Truck, New-School Materials\n\nLike the old Expedition, the new one maintains traditional, trucklike body-on-frame construction. Under the skin, the Expedition is an F-150 enhanced with an independent rear suspension instead of a solid live axle. This arrangement also allows for a lower load floor in the cargo area, enabling the third row to fold away completely — an advantage over the Chevy Tahoe’s seats, which fold flat but not into the floor. The Tahoe’s raised floor eats into cargo space and makes it more difficult to load objects.\n\nLike the F-150, the Expedition’s body is now aluminum, but the weight difference for 2018 isn’t that significant — just a 119-pound decrease for the base trim versus a comparable 2017 Expedition. Ford added all kinds of equipment and sound insulation that serve to offset some of the benefit of lightweight aluminum. The body looks slick, with a new and thoroughly modern appearance that’s much more in keeping with the modern style of truck: high beltline, smaller windows and chunkier style. It’s fresh, attractive and has a distinctly more aerodynamic look than the outgoing model.\n\nThe Expedition comes in two lengths: Expedition and Expedition Max (formerly Expedition EL). The extra room doesn’t do anything for passenger space, but it does increase the cargo area behind the third row, so you’re not forced to choose between extra rear passengers and extra luggage capacity. My primary test vehicle was a regular-length Expedition, though Cars.com editors have also driven the Max.\n\nOld-Style Power, New-Style Engine\n\nPowering the new Expedition is Ford’s ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a carryover engine. It puts out a healthy 375 horsepower in most trim levels and 400 hp in the top Platinum. New to the setup is a standard 10-speed automatic transmission — available with either rear- or all-wheel drive — and an electronic limited-slip differential.\n\nFire up the V-6 and it sounds like a well-tuned turbo-diesel. Some of the engine’s noise is artificially generated through the stereo (all that soundproofing would prevent you from hearing the engine otherwise), but the sound that does come through is a fun mix of whooshing turbos and raspy exhaust. It sounds sufficiently butch for the truck it powers.\n\nI found driving it to be quite a pleasant surprise, as well — the V-6 more than adequately powers the Expedition in both regular and Max versions, and it gets even punchier when you twist the rotary drive mode selector into Sport. Climbing the canyons above Malibu, Calif., handling the tight, twisting sweepers, descending into quick switchbacks — the Expedition exudes confidence and stability. Sport mode tightens up steering feedback and changes both accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift points, making those twisties even easier to take. Nobody will confuse the Expedition for a Mustang, but it by no means embarrasses itself on high-speed, challenging roads.\n\nRide quality is also outstanding. Wheel sizes vary from 18 to 22 inches depending on trim level and equipment. Higher-spec trims get an electronically adjustable suspension, but lesser models’ suspensions provide a smooth, well-controlled ride, as well; there are no crazy, tippy body motions. If you need an off-road rig, Ford’s got you covered there, too: An FX4 package is available that brings underbody protection, a low-range transfer case, special tuning for the electronic limited-slip differential, Michelin Primacy tires on smaller wheels, off-road shocks, a heavy-duty radiator and unique badging.\n\nHooked up to a 5,500-pound camper, my Expedition towed like a champ, chugging up 6 percent inclines with ease, accelerating despite the load it hauled. The 10-speed automatic is well-matched to the engine, holding gears on downhill grades to save the Expedition’s brakes and maintain easy control. The instrument panel also shows you tons of information, such as which gear the transmission’s in at any given time.\n\nTrailer sway control comes with a heavy-duty towing package, as does Ford’s super-nifty Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature, which allows you to back up a trailer using a dedicated rotary knob on the dash and backup cameras. It takes the guesswork and trial and error out of backing up a trailer, making even the newest novice look like a veteran trucker.\n\nWhere the Expedition falls short is in fuel economy, especially when towing. It also features a smaller gas tank than its main competition, meaning its overall range is notably shorter. The regular Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with two-wheel drive, 17/22/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. The longer Expedition Max clocks in at 17/23/19 mpg with 2WD, 16/21/18 mpg with 4WD. In a recent real-world test for the Full-Size SUV Challenge, my Expedition 4WD achieved 21.5 mpg in combined driving, better than its 19 mpg rating. But that number dropped dramatically to 10.2 mpg when towing a camper — a steeper loss than the V-8-powered competitors in our Challenge exhibited, though still not the lowest mpg. Turns out that the twin-turbocharged engines positively suck down the petrol when you put the engine under some serious load, as I did up and down the hills of eastern Arizona. Combine that with the smaller gas tank, and you’ll be making frequent pit stops if you’re towing a trailer cross-country.\n\nBetter Inside, But Details Are Important\n\nThe interior looks as if it could have been lifted directly from the F-150, with all the pros and cons that entails. It’s spacious, with excellent outward visibility, but the front seats feel unsupportive over longer voyages. One of our taller reviewers could not get comfortable, with his legs always at an angle and most of his thighs unsupported by the oddly short bottom cushions. The backseats are high, with plenty of room, and the ability to slide fore and aft means passengers in the two rear rows can negotiate legroom amongst themselves. The third row is usable for adults even when the second row is adjusted all the way rearward; slide it forward a bit and there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. The second row also tilts and slides forward at the touch of a button, making ingress to the third row easier.\n\nMaterials quality in the cabin is mixed. The F-150 isn’t known for having the best environment in its own class; it features plenty of hard plastic and seams between parts that simply don’t flow together well. Some of this, like plastic molding seams on the grab handles, can be chalked up to early build quality, but some of it is simply how it’s designed — it’s a pickup truck that’s been given a healthy makeover, but it’s still a pickup truck in the ways that count. For a vehicle that can easily approach $90,000 in fully loaded Platinum trim and even top $70,000 for a well-equipped Limited model, this kind of detail is important. All the fancy quilted leather in the world doesn’t excuse the fact that other parts look cheap.\n\nThe Latest Tech\n\nThankfully, Ford loads you up with tech goodies for that kind of coin, including gadgets that entertain (you can stream live TV to the entertainment system via Slingplayer and Sync 3, or even hook up a big-screen TV for tailgating), some that keep you safe (all kinds of lane-keeping aids, steering aids, anti-collision aids and autonomous braking systems), and some that help you drive (like the aforementioned trailer backup assist). The high-end audio system is by the new B&O Play brand, a division of Bang & Olufsen, and it sounds fantastic.\n\nThe entire experience in the Expedition is one of a significant upgrade, easily on par with the Chevy and GMC models on many levels and surpassing them in flexibility, spaciousness and amenities.\n\nAll This Utility Does Not Come Cheap\n\nIf you haven’t priced out a full-size SUV in awhile, you’d better sit down for this next part. The starting price for an Expedition XL 4×2 is $49,290 including destination charges, but you’ll never see that price on a dealer lot — they’re meant for fleet sales to utilities or city governments.\n\nFar more likely to be found is an XLT trim, which starts at $52,985 with two-wheel drive. Specifying four-wheel drive adds between $3,000 and $3,200 to the price depending on trim level. Add in everything you can get and you’re looking at an Expedition Max Platinum 4×4 that will stop just short of 85 grand.\n\nMy regular-length Limited 4×4 model stickered at $72,655 including destination, and that included several popular equipment packages and leather for the first and second rows. For comparison’s sake, the new 2018 Lincoln Navigator starts around $73,000 and can top out around $100,000.\n\nStill, the Expedition’s price is easily competitive with vehicles like the Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon. It comes in at a bit more than the Nissan Armada, but it’s a significantly larger vehicle with a much bigger interior. It’s comparable in size to the Toyota Sequoia but has far surpassed that old, outdated model. It’s more refined, with a much nicer interior and a multimedia system that’s at least two or three generations more current.\n\nWith buyers snapping up big SUVs in increasing numbers, Ford’s update to its big truck comes at the perfect time. That the truck is as good as it is should put Chevy on notice.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

What were once mainstream models accessible to the masses, full-size SUVs continue their expensive upmarket climb with more content, more luxurious interiors, and greater levels of safety and self-driving technology. The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon got their updates first, then Jeep joined the fray with the arrival of the all-new Wagoneer. Now it’s Ford’s turn to the party, and it’s come with an updated Expedition that features a redone interior, new self-driving and safety tech, and two new variants: Timberline for the off-road enthusiasts, and the Stealth Edition Performance Package for the on-road enthusiasts.\n\nRelated: Here’s What the New STX Edition on the 2021 Ford Expedition Costs\n\nExterior\n\nCosmetic changes to the 2022 Expedition are minor and consist of revised front and rear lights, grilles, bumpers and spoilers. The bigger news is the two new versions. First is the new Expedition Timberline, expanding the trim level first seen on the 2021 Ford Explorer Timberline. Billed as the most capable off-road version of the Expedition ever created, it features visual distinctions with orange accents and badges, and black wheels rolling on 33-inch all-terrain tires. If rock crawling is not your thing but mall crawling is, the new Stealth Edition Performance Package might be more your speed, available on the Limited trim level for both the Expedition and long-wheelbase Expedition Max. Designed to have a more urban appeal, it has a “murdered out” look with gloss-black accents, grille, mirror caps, roof rails, window pillars and big 22-inch gloss-black wheels. Of course, there are still other trim levels for the Expedition, including the XL, STX, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and the super-luxe range-topping Platinum, which features satin and chrome accents.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nPowering the updated Expedition will be a choice of three offerings from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6. Most versions (XL, STX and XLT) get the standard EcoBoost engine making 380 horsepower and 470 pounds-feet of torque, while the Limited, King Ranch and Platinum get the 400-hp 3.5-liter with 480-pounds-feet of torque. The Timberline and Stealth Edition Performance Package will get the optional uprated version now making 440 hp and an eye-popping 510 pounds-feet of torque. All versions are mated to a standard 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with four-wheel drive optional on all models.\n\nBoth the new Timberline and Stealth Edition Performance Package get some different equipment, however. The Timberline becomes the most capable off-road version of the Expedition thanks to standard four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case, a mechanical limited-slip differential, seven different selectable electronic drive modes, the steel skid plate from a 2022 Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck, and dedicated off-road steering with unique stabilizer bars and springs. It wears different front and rear bumpers and rides on taller all-terrain tires, allowing for improved approach and departure angles, and ground clearance of 10.6 inches, which is up from a previous maximum of 9.8 inches. It’s improved electronics and vehicle architecture allow for the addition of the Trail Turn Assist feature first seen on the new Bronco, which allows selective braking of a wheel that Ford says makes the vehicle nearly pivot around a fixed point on loose terrain.\n\nFor the on-road enthusiast, the Stealth Edition Performance Package brings a firmer sport suspension, combined with Ford’s continuously controlled electronic shock damping with “Road Preview” forward-facing scanners, which allows adjustment of the vehicle’s suspension in anticipation of changing road conditions or surfaces.\n\nThe Expedition can drag up to 9,300 pounds when properly equipped with the Heavy Duty Trailer Tow Package; the Timberline trim is limited to slightly less at 9,200 pounds. Updates to the truck’s electronics have also let Ford fit the updated 2.0 version of the novel Pro Trailer Backup Assist to the Expedition, which helps to reverse with a trailer when the kit is all properly installed.\n\nInterior\n\nThe biggest upgrades come inside, where the Expedition frankly needed the most help to stay current with the latest crop of luxury-oriented competitors. A new interior graces the big SUV, with a new dash that eschews the “horizontal” look that a lot of new models are going for in favor of the optional inclusion of the massive 15.5-inch portrait-oriented multimedia screen first seen in the Ford Mustang Mach-E EV and upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup; it runs the latest Sync 4A system, featuring a multimedia system organized by “dash cards” instead of menus. A 12-inch horizontal screen running the more traditional Sync 4 system is standard. A 12.4-inch digital instrument panel is available on some models, bringing an electronic display behind the steering wheel, like the one in the latest F-150.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Ford Expedition Platinum: What You Get When You Go Big\nHow We Went From a Safari to an Expedition: Our Car-Shopping Journey\nOff-Road Package for 2020 Ford Expedition Limited Boasts Best of Both Worlds\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: More Quantity, More Quality\nWhat’s the Best Full-Size SUV for 2018?\nResearch the Ford Expedition\n\nThe interior upgrade isn’t just electronic however, with material choices and changes on the new Expedition’s top trim models. The new Timberline model gets a unique look, as well, with an exclusive Cypress Green interior with umber accents and stitching. Go for the Stealth Edition Performance Package, and that interior goes dark with an all-black environment with orange stitching, granite appliques and dark anodized-gray accents. Even the Platinum trim gets some material attention, with three unique color options, luxurious quilted leather seating, black wood and brushed aluminum trim.\n\nAn upgraded Bang & Olufsen Unleashed premium audio system will be available on King Ranch, Platinum, Timberline and Stealth Edition Performance Package models, featuring 22 speakers, a dedicated subwoofer and 360-degree surround sound. For backseat passengers, Amazon Fire TV has been added to the rear-seat entertainment system.\n\nSafety and Technology\n\nFord also upped the Expedition safety content with the inclusion of Ford CoPilot-360 as standard on the SUV. It also brought the BlueCruise semi-autonomous hands-free driving system to the Expedition. Standard on the Platinum model, it enables a driver to set the system on two-lane divided highways that have been previously mapped by the service and take their hands off the wheel. Other Expeditions also bring enhanced safety technology, including lane keep assist, automatic front and rear emergency braking, and evasive steering assist.\n\nPricing for the 2022 Expedition will be coming closer to the vehicle’s on sale date, currently scheduled for the first few months of 2022.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Sept. 21, 2021, to reflect new powertrain ratings.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
