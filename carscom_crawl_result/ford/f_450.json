      "expert_review": "Flipping through the channels late at night, you may have come across that show: The one with huge men in tights tossing 55-gallon drums full of rocks, towing DC9s with their braided back-hair and waddling through an open field playing ultimate Frisbee with manhole covers.\n\nYou want to, but you can’t look away, even as they chalk up their thighs to prevent their polyester bodysuits from a frictional meltdown.\n\nThe World’s Strongest Man Competition may have a new contestant: The 2011 Ford Super Duty. It’s a super-duty freak.\n\nIf this truck was a person, Congress would have inquiries into performance-enhancing drugs. Its strength is obscene, its power nearly absolute.\n\nDuring some quick testing of the Super Duty at an Arizona rock pit — heavy duty trucks live in pits — I pulled an 86,000-pound front end loader, crawled over boulders and then drove back to the hotel with 1,000 pounds in the bed and four people in the cab and managed to top 23 miles per gallon.\n\nI became Herculean, all the while blasting the air conditioning and sipping a protein shake. (OK, it was a Diet Coke — I don’t need my thighs rubbing together.)\n\nThe redesigned F-Series Super Duty includes more flavors than Baskin Robbins, with variations of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 pickups. They were pretty good before, but now they come with improved powertrains, including Ford’s all new 6.7-liter V-8 diesel engine.\n\nInstead of having some other diesel company produce the engine, Ford took on the job itself — creating a Picasso out of a power plant with a compact graphite and aluminum block.\n\nSeriously, the diesel engine is quiet and smooth and cranks out Magnús Ver Magnússon kind of muscle: 390 horsepower and 735 pound-feet of torque.\n\nInstead of simply putting lots of sound-dampening material around the engine to deaden those clacking injectors, Ford tightened the engine’s configuration, moved pieces around and made it lighter, quieter and more powerful.\n\nIt’s even designed to burn B20 biodiesel, if only someone would sell B20 biodiesel.\n\nWhen you tow with this engine, and nearly everyone who buys a Super Duty tows, you’ll quickly forget there’s 12,000 pounds behind you. (The most it can pull is 24,400 pounds.) That’s about 600 more pounds than even Lithuanian great Zydrunas Savickas could carry during the farmers walk through the Power Pit.\n\nHeavy loads, no big deal\n\nBut the truck only gets better from there. For gas burners, and those who want to avoid the $7,835 diesel premium, there’s a 6.2-liter V-8 gasoline engine that can still pull up to 22,500 pounds with its 385 horsepower and 405 pound-feet of torque.\n\nWith either truck, you’ll end up with the TorqShift six-speed transmission — and you want to end up with that; it’s the real gem to this entire setup.\n\nSilky smooth, it adapts and adjusts to the driver and the weight. Pulling a 10,000-pound trailer up a steep hill for a couple of miles is child’s play. It can handle all of the low-end torque of the diesel and still go on the gas-engine version. (There are some changes to the transmission for the gas model, but it’s basically the same.) The transmission also allows for exhaust braking — a great feature for long downhill runs while towing, though I wish I could have heard it. It will downshift when you need it and keep you from burning up your brakes.\n\nAdd to that a programmable transmission that allows the driver to limit the top gear and manually shift gears with a selector button on the steering column mounted shifter, and you’ve got everything a trailer hauler needs. Ford has also added a hill start assist that gives a driver stopped on a hill a few seconds to move his foot from the brake to the accelerator without the vehicle rolling backwards. (There is also a hill descent control that lets the Super Duty head off-road and roll down boulders without touching the accelerator or brake.)\n\nAll told, the Super Duty engineers and designers were no dumbbells. They carried their weight and then some.\n\nSome of the other features include the trailer sway control and a brake trailer control, mounted on the dash on the right side of the steering wheel. That’s the place most people can reach easily in a hurry; and if you’re reaching for it, you’re probably in a hurry.\n\nFor those who want to haul a fifth wheel, Ford will now offer a factory installed gooseneck substructure that is covered under the warranty. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, it’s OK, but if you do, you know how cool that really is. The system is nearly invisible until you need to use it. It’s genius.\n\nRoom to stretch out\n\nThen there’s inside the cabin. Ford took the super-comfortable seats from its new F-150 and used those in the Super Duty. There are changes throughout, including an optional 4.5-inch LCD screen mounted between the speedometer and the tachometer. It seems to know everything but your birthday. It uses easy-to-understand categories that even Jon Pall Sigmarsson could click through easily if he wasn’t dead. Ford has even included a trailer hookup checklist for novice haulers.\n\nThe only thing missing was a second glove box, a feature other pickups offer and a great place to keep a gun — as long as it is registered and you possess a concealed weapons permit (state laws do apply). There is, however, lockable storage under the second-row seat, a feature hunters will greatly appreciate. And there are lots of cubbies and storage features throughout. Ford also added second-row ventilation — it’s good to keep the air moving in these trucks at the end of the day.\n\nThere’s plenty of space inside the cabin, which can easily fit the top five strongest men in the world. The interior feels both plush and down to business. It’s a work ethic kind of vehicle that simply won’t quit.\n\nAnd it looks like at the end of the day, it heads to the gym to work out and blow off some steam. It’s rippled with power — with lots of lines drawing your eye around the vehicle and the clamshell hood suggesting that there’s so much power under there that designers didn’t have a choice but to try to find a little more space. (In fact, that’s true.)\n\nThe 2011 Super Duty is a powerful tool, and for many customers, the most expensive tool in box — hitting $40,000 easily. But it’s like the winner of the World’s Strongest Man Competition. He is rarely the one who can simply lift the most. He’s the one who can do well in all of the challenges. These pickups won’t shy away from any work, they relish it.\n\nAnd that’s worth staying up late and watching.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport card\n\nOverall:****\n\nExterior: Excellent. Bold and expressive. This truck looks like it means business and it does.\n\nInterior: Excellent. Comfortable, complete and very sophisticated. It lets hard workers rest between job sites.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. Can tow anything attached to it and still provide a smooth quiet ride. Excellent road manners fully loaded or with an empty bed.\n\nPros: Will let you do more work in less time.\n\nCons: Will let you do more work in less time.\n\nGrading Scale\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe F-Series Super Duty is Ford’s line of heavy-duty pickup trucks, which are available in a variety of configurations and three model series: F-250, F-350 and F-450. The truck can carry as many as six people when properly configured, and competitors include 2500 and 3500 models in the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Ram truck lines.\n\nTwo engines are available: a 6.2-liter gas V-8 and a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission.\nNew for 2013\nFord debuts a Platinum edition of the Super Duty that comes standard with upscale features like a backup camera, navigation system, MyFord Touch, remote start, power-adjustable pedals, power-telescoping mirrors and 20-inch polished-aluminum wheels. The truck also gets a mesh grille surrounded by satin chrome trim as well as chrome tow hooks, door handles, mirror covers and exhaust tip. Inside, there’s a heated leather steering wheel, premium leather upholstery, woodgrain-style trim, two USB ports, A/V connection points and an SD card slot.\nExterior\nA 2011 restyling brought a “power dome” hood, a bolder grille stamped with a Super Duty logo and an oversized Ford oval badge. Buyers have the choice of an extended cab (Super Cab) with a 6.75- or 8-foot box and a crew cab with four conventional doors and a 6.75- or 8-foot box. Dual-rear-wheel models are available with the 8-foot box. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard trailer hitch receiver\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- and 20-inch wheels available\nOptional PowerScope towing mirrors \nOptional power moonroof\nOptional tubular side steps or running boards\nOptional spray-in bedliner\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty borrows seats from the Ford F-150 pickup truck, and it offers a three-place front bench seat or front bucket seats. The bench seat is split 40/20/40, and a lockable under-seat center storage compartment is optional. A wide center console is available on models with front buckets and includes a bin large enough to hold a laptop computer. On the Lariat, heated and cooled front seats with a memory feature for the power driver’s seat are optional. Crew cab models have a three-place rear bench seat that flips up to reveal a flat cargo floor. An available 4.2-inch LCD screen in the instrument cluster shows fuel-economy information and monitors off-road and towing details. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nOptional navigation system with SiriusXM Travel Link\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Sync system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 6.2-liter gas V-8 is a single-overhead-camshaft engine that runs on regular gas or E85 ethanol. It produces 385 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe available Power Stroke 6.7-liter turbo-diesel V-8 produces 400 hp and a massive 800 pounds-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm, making it the logical choice for serious towing and hauling. The Power Stroke V-8 burns regular diesel fuel or a blend of up to 20 percent biodiesel.\n\nBoth engines work with a standard six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates Ford’s SelectShift technology, which enables driver-initiated shifts. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nGas V-8 can be fitted to run on CNG/LPG\n\nSafety\nSafety features on the Super Duty include:\n\n\nElectronic stability system with Roll Stability Control\nSide curtain airbags\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nOptional rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera",

      "expert_review": "I got the call. You know, the call. When someone asks you to help move stuff with your truck. If you own a pickup, sooner or later you always get the call. But this wasn’t the usual, “I need help moving,” or, “Can you help me take some junk to the dump?” This was a desperate plea from the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen asking me to help save Bambi.\n\nSee, my wife took the lead coordinating volunteers to build a new feed garden at the California Wildlife Center (CWC) near Los Angeles. The noble folks at the CWC selflessly give their time and skills 365-days a year to rescue and rehabilitate injured animals for release back into the wild. And my kids and their classmates were in on this too because this was a community service project for the younger grades at their school.\n\nLove, guilt, and helpless baby animals, there was no escaping this request.\n\nThe mission was to haul two cubic-yards of donated topsoil from a nursery in Simi Valley to the animal sanctuary, about 40-miles away. It might not sound like it, but that’s a lot of dirt. A cubic-yard is 27 cubic-feet and weighs about 2,250-lb. Carbon footprint counting moms and dads with visions of using their Prius to adventurously haul a bag or two of mulch cruelly found they couldn’t complete the circle of life with their alt-powertrain sedans. Not unless they wanted to make ten or twenty trips.\n\nEven half-ton trucks are challenged by loads like this. The most capable 2008 Toyota Tundra (Regular Cab 5.7-liter V8 4×2) has a max payload rating of only 1,925-lb. And most three-quarter-ton and one-ton pickups won’t work either. A Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Crew Cab Long Bed Dual Rear Wheel (DRW) 6.6-liter Duramax V8 diesel 4×4 can only manage up to 4,029-lb. (4,706-lb. with the 6.0-liter gas V8).\n\nNo, this called for serious hauling capability. If we were going to save Bambi, it was going to be done as efficiently as possible using the biggest pickup we could find – because I was sure I was going to get a call from my wife when we were loading up asking for ‘just one more’ cubic-yard of soil, which I figured I could negotiate down to a half cubic-yard extra.\n\nThe only truck that fit the task was Ford’s one-and-one-half-ton 2008 F-450 Super Duty Crew Cab 6.4-liter Power Stroke Diesel V8.\n\nThe last time we drove the “Big Dog Daddy” of pickups was during the 2007 Heavy Duty Shootout. We used it to tow a 20,000-lb. trailer up an insanely steep 25% grade, but we didn’t drive it unloaded or hauling cargo. Helping out the CWC was all the excuse needed to test the F-450’s astounding 5,720-lb. payload rating (the 4×2 F-450 has an even higher 6,120-lb. max payload). That’s 1,000-lb. more than either a Dodge Ram 3500 Quad Cab Long Bed DRW 4×4 or the Silverado 3500.\n\nWe borrowed the optional 4.88 rear axle version (4.30 is standard), geared for pulling the biggest loads. It’s detuned, to 325-horsepower / 600 lb-ft of torque, compared to the standard 4.30 truck rated at 350-hp / 650 lb-ft., to reduce driveline wear.\n\nThe F-450 is Ford’s Class 4 chassis cab truck with a factory pickup box. It’s commercial grade but Ford has civilized this beast so it looks normal, almost. The tell is the widetrack monobeam front suspension and extended axle that adds big front wheel cutouts and bulging arches to the truck. The radius-arm suspension gives the F-450 its bulldog stance but it also shrinks the truck’s turning radius to 50-feet, versus 56-ft for a conventional narrow track F-350. The F-450 is surprisingly agile maneuvering at low speeds even though its length is just shy of 22-ft. But it’s agile like an NFL linebacker instead of a ballet dancer because the truck is 95.5-in. wide – enough to require side and roof marker lamps.\n\nDriving the F-450 empty was comfortable, as long as the road was smooth and the lanes wide. It has 11,000-lb. of rear spring capacity and rides on 19.5-inch wheels with 12-ply steel belted tires aired up at 80-psi. Hit a bump unloaded and you feel the shockwave from the rear leaf springs in your eyeballs. Taming the F-450’s ride requires pushing the truck past the limits of most full-size pickups. If you want to be rewarded with a smooth ride you need to work the F-450 hard.\n\nI called ahead to the plant nursery to setup a time to receive the soil. These guys know dirt. They also know what it takes to move dirt, and they assume you do too if you’re asking for a few cubic-yards. I had some fun though asking how they wanted to load up my Prius. There was 5 seconds of silence while the professional gardener figured how to politely tell me a Prius wasn’t going to work. Not even if they carved out a space for me to drive the car and filled most of the rest of it with earth, though that might improve its aerodynamics by giving it a lower profile.\n\nI’m not making this up. When we arrived at the nursery there was a half-ton pickup getting ready to head out. Its owner looked shell shocked as he cleaned a foot-high pile of dirt from the roof of his extended cab. He was standing on a gigantic mound of raw soil in the cargo box, which was sagging noticeably over the rear wheels. See, there are two kinds of truck owner. Those who estimate cargo capacity by volume – as in, I can fill my pickup’s cargo box with whatever can fit in its dimensions, like furniture, dirt, or matter from a neutron star. And those who logically fill cargo capacity based on a truck’s rated hauling capability – as in, I’m not driving home riding on the bump stops.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you won’t overload a truck. Almost all pickups are engineered to handle an overload situation, but only for a few moments, like when a cubic-yard of earth is being dumped in the back of the truck from a skip loader. And the guy at the nursery is the last person you should depend on to tell you if your truck can handle a load. He just wants to sell you dirt.\n\nWe took care of the donation paperwork first, out of sight from the F-450. So ready or not we were committed to receiving about 2.5-tons of soil, or the equivalent of 1.6-Priuses. When we arrived at the truck the skip loader operator, who was basically the Yoda of dirt, knowingly approved our choice of hauler for the task. “Good for hauling earth the F-450 is,” I swore I heard him murmur.\n\nAlmost before I was able to get the camera ready, the gardener was belted in the loader dumping soil from a height of about 5-feet over the bed. The dirt tumbled out like a waterfall into the cargo box. It was amazing to watch as the F-450 received it all in about 6-seconds with barely a shudder, sound or sag. 2,250-lb. down, 2,250-lb. to go.\n\nThe second load was dumped just like the first. By the time it was done we had a pyramid of dirt in the back of the F-450 but the rear suspension squatted only about 2 or 3-inches, almost unnoticeably.\n\nWe leveled the pile so it was even, just below the bottoms of the cargo rails. Turns out we didn’t need any more soil because the CWC had overloaded their half-ton the day before hauling one cubic-yard back to the future garden.\n\nThe last step was sprinkling several gallons of water over the dirt before covering it with a tarp, to prevent leaving a bread crumb trail of soil and amendment on the freeway.\n\nThe improvement in ride and handling was immediately noticeable leaving the nursery. The F-450 was better planted (no pun intended) on the road. Rear bucking over expansion joints and tarmac flaws disappeared.\n\nWith its 4.88 rear axle, acceleration wasn’t quick unloaded but torque was always present. Now, loaded, acceleration felt only marginally slower than empty – testament to the Power Stroke V8 diesel’s lower gearing, dual sequential turbos and strong 600 lb-ft available at only 2,000-rpm. If you want to see hard performance metrics for a similar truck, read our Heavy Duty Shootout for empirical data.\n\nThe transmission’s tow haul mode helped in stop and go city traffic, holding its gear and reducing the need to constantly foot brake and accelerate. On the freeway we cruised at 60-mph and a lazy 2,250-rpm. Tow haul mode helped again climbing and descending hills in the Santa Monica Mountains. But while steering was nimble at low speeds, the 8,600-lb pickup, with 4,500-lb of soil, had moderate understeer doing reasonable speeds on the twisty hills between Calabasas and Malibu.\n\nThe last step was hauling the load up a steep, narrow driveway to the Wildlife Center. We pulled up to a fenced area where the garden was planned and backed the F-450 into a pen with only two-inches of clearance on either side of the pickup’s rear wheel arches. It was so tight we had to fold the side mirrors in to get the truck all the way back.\n\nFinally, we lowered the tailgate, grabbed some shovels and tossed out the fresh soil into a pile to be spread by the volunteers the next day. That’s the only time I’ve even been thankful for having a thick plastic drop-in bedliner instead of a spray-in liner. And, to be filed away for future reference, if you’re moving dirt in back of a pickup, lay down a tarp on the bottom of the cargo box. It would have made cleaning the last few pounds of dirt from the bed much easier, simply sliding out the sheet.\n\nBut the most painful part of the soil hauling expedition was still ahead. We stopped to fill the truck with diesel on the way home. Contrary to rumor, it’s not called an F-450 because that’s the price of a gallon of diesel at some stations around Los Angeles. We got away with $4.09 per gallon.\n\nAfter driving 180-miles over three days around LA County, loaded and unloaded in almost every traffic condition possible, we averaged a gut clenching 9.2 9.5 miles-per-gallon. The truck consumed just shy of 20-gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel for a grand total of $81.36. Yeah, that hurt our wallet, but at least it felt good knowing we helped Bambi.\n\nTEST VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n2008 Ford F-450 Super Duty Lariat 4×4 Dual Rear Wheel Crew Cab\n\nEngine Size and Type: 6.4-liter V8 Power Stroke Diesel\n\nHorsepower (hp): 325-hp\n\nTorque (ft-lbs): 600 lb-ft\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nRear Axle: 4.88 Limited Slip\n\nBase Price: $50,355\n\n4 Rear LT225/70Rx19.5G BSW Traction Tires and\n\n2 Front LT225/70Rx19.5G BSW All Season Tires: $190\n\n4×4 Off Road Package: $225\n\nExtra Heavy Duty Alternator: $75\n\nElectronic Shift on the Fly: $185\n\nEngine Block Heater: $35\n\nRapid Heat Supplemental Cab Heater: $250\n\nPowre Slide Rear Window: $185\n\nPower Moonroof: $995\n\nMemory Group: $225\n\nUpfitter Switches: $85\n\nReverse Vehicle Aid Sensor: $245\n\nTailgate Step: $375\n\nPower Adjustable Pedals: $120\n\nSirius Satellite Radio: $200\n\nTraction Control: $130\n\nNavigation Radio with Audiophile 6-CD: $1,875\n\nHeated Front Seats: $220\n\nRubber Floormats: $25 Price as Tested: $55,995\n\nDestination & Delivery: $925\n\nTotal MSRP: $56,920",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that’s engineered to tackle the most extreme towing and hauling challenges. The lineup consists of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks. Buyers can choose from two gasoline engines — a 405-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 and a 430-hp, 7.3-liter V-8 — or a turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel that makes 475 hp in its standard form or 500 hp in high-output form. Every engine is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and a 10-speed automatic is standard across the lineup. The Super Duty’s primary rivals are the Chevrolet Silverado HD and Ram Heavy Duty.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty lineup was redesigned for the 2023 model year and sees a number of available trim and technology updates for 2025, along with a shuffling of standard and optional equipment. A ritzy Platinum Plus Package includes a unique satin-finish grille with bright chrome accents, a Smoked Truffle interior featuring perforated Venetian leather seats with French stitching, and a 2-kilowatt onboard power source for tools and toys. Available towing tech now includes an auxiliary trailer camera, a tire pressure monitoring system for trailers and blind spot monitors that cover the length of whatever you’re towing.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 13,800 to 40,000 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Super Duty’s curb weight ranges from 5,697 to 8,627 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nThree-seat regular cab\n8-inch touchscreen\nFour-speaker audio system\n40/20/40-split, folding vinyl bench seat\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\nWi-Fi hot spot\n17-inch steel wheels\nTrailer-tow side mirrors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-inch digital instrument display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-wheel rear axle\nTremor Off-Road Package\nLeather seating\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nShould I Buy the 2025 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty is one of the toughest, most capable trucks available, period. It can be a no-nonsense work vehicle when equipped with a minimum of frills, or it can be a veritable luxury-lined cruiser that also happens to be capable of towing and hauling pretty much anything thrown its way. Speaking of towing and hauling, the Super Duty is available with an unmatched array of smart technology features — including Pro Trailer Hitch Assist and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System — meant to make those tasks much easier.\n\nThere’s no doubt the F-250, F-350 and F-450 are hugely versatile, but they may also be way too much truck for many people. Key rivals, specifically the Ram Heavy Duty, receive more opulent interior trim when scaling up to range-topping variants. The Super Duty’s ride can also get jittery when equipped with off-road hardware, such as the optional Tremor Off-Road Package. Still, when it comes to getting a job done, the Ford Super Duty is among the very best in the business.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty is one of the more playful trucks on the market, with three interesting theme packages: King Ranch, Harley-Davidson and the new Cabela’s edition. The Super Duty is available in regular cab, SuperCab and crew cab in either 4×2 or 4×4 drivetrain. The regular cab comes only with a 8-foot cargo bed, while the other two cabs can be ordered with either an 8-foot or 6.75-foot bed.\n\nThe F-350 SuperCab long bed and crew cab long bed can be ordered with dual rear wheels. The F-450 comes only in crew cab long bed with DRW. Ford continues with its familiar trim level offerings: XL, XLT, FX4 and Lariat.\n\nThe Super Duty series boasts the highest payload and tow ratings for non-commercial trucks. A properly equipped F-250 can carry 3,200 pounds and tow more than 16,000 pounds. The F-350 goes up to 5,700 and 18,400 pounds, respectively. The F-450 can carry three tons of payload and has a maximum tow rating of 24,500 pounds (with a fifth wheel).\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Super Duty was redesigned for the 2008 model year. For 2009, Super Duty trucks get the new F-150’s electronic features, including Ford Work Solutions, a collection of technologies that help businesses keep track of tools and projects; hands-free, voice-activated Sync; and voice-activated navigation with Sirius Travel Link.\n\nThe Cabela’s special edition pickup is based on the offroad-inspired FX4 trim. Ford says more than 75 percent of F-Series owners hunt or fish, so Cabela’s package is designed to appeal to those likely to shop at the famed outfitter. There are interior materials unique to the package and additional lockable storage for firearms.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson edition returns on the F-450 model. This Harley is easy to spot, with large blue flames coming from the side vents. The familiar cues of black leather interior and metal badges maintain the theme.\n\nFinally, Ford is offering a spray-on factory bedliner; the automated sprayer applies the film in a thinner but uniform manner to reduce weight while minimizing load slippage.\n\nExterior\nThe Super Duty’s bulk is well-proportioned, even on short-bed models. Ford offers a wide range of colors, paint schemes and 19 different wheels to help distinguish the different trim lines and special packages. For commercial customers, there’s a pickup-box-delete option, so custom service bodies can be adapted to the chassis.\n\nPowerScope tow mirrors standard on some models; manual telescoping trailer mirror standard on others\nAvailable moonroof on crew cab\nFront and rear step bumpers help access engine bay, cargo box\nAvailable tubular side steps or running board\nOffroad package includes skid plates\nPower-sliding rear window standard on Lariat, available on other models\nAvailable tailgate step\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty has a luxury option for almost every application. Like the offroad look of the FX4 but want heated leather seats, Sync and a six-CD changer? Order the FX4 Luxury Package.\n\nOther packages include the Lariat Plus, Lariat Ultimate and the Cabela’s Luxury Package. Certain packages require specific trim levels. The Harley-Davidson F-450 and King Ranch have front and rear captain’s chairs with leather-trimmed center consoles. On diesel models, there is an available Rapid-Heat supplemental heater to warm up the cab quickly on cold mornings.\n\nAvailable premium sound system with eight speakers and a subwoofer\nAvailable navigation, Sirius Satellite Radio\nAll sound systems have auxiliary input jack for MP3 players\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nFlexFold rear seat on XLT, FX4 and Lariat provides steel load floor\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n300-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshafts and three valves per cylinder, rated at 365 pounds-feet of peak torque\n362-hp, 6.8-liter V-10, with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshaft and three-valves per cylinder, rated at 457 pounds-feet of peak torque\n350-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 turbo-diesel, iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and four-valves per cylinder, rated at 650 pounds-feet of peak torque (325-hp and 600 pounds-feet of torque for F-450 models)\nSix-speed manual transmission (standard on all three engines)\nFive-speed automatic transmission (available on all three engines)\n\nSafety\nThe Super Duty comes with antilock brakes, massive four-wheel disc brakes and front airbags.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that’s engineered to tackle the most extreme towing and hauling challenges. The lineup consists of the F-250, F-350 and F-450 trucks. Buyers can choose from two gasoline engines — a 405-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 or a 430-hp, 7.3-liter V-8 — and a turbocharged diesel 6.7-liter that makes 475 hp or 500 hp in high-output form. Every engine is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and a 10-speed automatic is standard across the lineup. Super Duty rivals include the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500, Nissan Titan XD, and Ram 2500 and 3500.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford Super Duty lineup is fresh from a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, so changes are minimal for 2024. The 6.8-liter V-8 is now capable of running on E85 fuel, and there are minor alterations to the trucks’ standard and available equipment.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Super Duty’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 13,800 to 40,000 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty Weigh?\n\nThe Super Duty’s curb weight ranges from 5,697 to 8,627 pounds depending on body style, trim level and equipment. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nThree-seat regular cab\n8-inch touchscreen\nFour-speaker audio system\n40/20/40-split, folding vinyl bench seat\nRemote keyless entry\nCruise control\nWi-Fi hot spot\n17-inch steel wheels\nTrailer-tow side mirrors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-inch digital instrument display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nDual-wheel rear axle\nTremor off-road package\nLeather seating\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty is one of the toughest and most capable trucks available, period. It can be a no-nonsense work vehicle when equipped with a minimum of frills, or it can be a veritable luxury-lined cruiser that also happens to be capable of towing and hauling pretty much anything thrown its way. Speaking of towing and hauling, the Super Duty is available with an unmatched array of smart technology features — including the Pro Trailer Hitch Assist system and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System — meant to make those tasks much easier.\n\nThere’s no doubt the F-250, F-350 and F-450 are hugely versatile, but they may also be way too much truck for many people. Key rivals, specifically the Ram HDs, receive more opulent interior trim when scaling up to range-topping models. The Super Duty’s ride can also get jittery when equipped with off-road hardware, such as the optional Tremor Package. Still, when it comes to getting a job done, the Ford Super Duty is among the very best in the business.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Super Duty is one of the toughest and most versatile trucks on the market, but Ford has left its heavy-duty pickup truck virtually unchanged for 2010.\n\nThe Super Duty is available in regular cab, SuperCab and crew cab in either 4×2 or 4×4 drivetrain. The regular cab comes only with an 8-foot cargo bed, while the other two cabs can be ordered with either an 8-foot or 6.75-foot bed.\n\nThe F-350 SuperCab long bed and crew cab long bed can be ordered with dual rear wheels. The F-450 comes only in crew cab long bed with DRW.\n\nThe trim designations have been changed slightly for 2010: The FX4 off-road package is available for the XL, XLT and Lariat trims. The new Cabela’s trim incorporates the FX4 package and adds Cabela’s embroidery, decals and other features.\n\nA properly equipped F-250 can carry 3,200 pounds and tow more than 16,000 pounds. The F-350 goes up to 5,700 and 18,400 pounds, respectively. The F-450 can carry three tons of payload and has a maximum tow rating of 24,500 pounds (with a fifth wheel trailer hitch).\n\nNew for 2010\nThe Cabela’s special edition pickup is based on the off-road-inspired FX4 trim. Ford says more than 75 percent of F-Series owners hunt or fish, so the Cabela’s package is designed to appeal to those likely to shop at the outfitter. There are interior materials unique to the package and additional lockable storage for firearms.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson edition returns on the F-450 model. This Harley is easy to spot, with large blue flame decals coming from the side vents. The familiar cues of a black leather interior and metal badges maintain the theme.\n\nFinally, Ford is offering a spray-on factory bedliner.\n\nExterior\nThe Super Duty’s bulk is well-proportioned, even on short-bed models. Ford offers a wide range of colors, paint schemes and different wheels to help distinguish the different trim lines and special packages. For commercial customers, there’s a pickup-box-delete option, so custom service bodies can be adapted to the chassis.\n\nPowerScope tow mirrors standard on some models; manual telescoping trailer mirror standard on others\nAvailable moonroof on crew cab\nFront and rear step bumpers help access engine bay, cargo box\nAvailable tubular side steps or running boards\nOff-road package includes skid plates\nPower-sliding rear window standard on Lariat, available on other models\nAvailable tailgate step\n\nInterior\nThe Super Duty has a luxury option for almost every application. Like the off-road look of the FX4 but want heated leather seats, the Sync entertainment system and a six-CD changer? Order the FX4 Luxury Package.\n\nOther packages include the Lariat Plus, Lariat Ultimate and the Cabela’s Luxury Package. Certain packages require specific trim levels. The Harley-Davidson F-450 and King Ranch have front and rear captain’s chairs with leather-trimmed center consoles. On diesel models, there’s an available Rapid-Heat supplemental heater to warm up the cab quickly on cold mornings.\n\nAvailable premium sound system with eight speakers and a subwoofer\nAvailable navigation, Sirius Satellite Radio\nAll sound systems have auxiliary input jack for MP3 players\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\nFlexFold rear seat provides steel load floor\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n300-horsepower, 5.4-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshafts and three valves per cylinder, rated at 365 pounds-feet of peak torque\n362-hp, 6.8-liter V-10, with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, single overhead camshaft and three valves per cylinder, rated at 457 pounds-feet of peak torque\n350-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 turbo-diesel, iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and four valves per cylinder, rated at 650 pounds-feet of peak torque (325-hp and 600 pounds-feet of torque for F-450 models)\nSix-speed manual transmission (standard on all three engines)\nFive-speed automatic transmission (available on all three engines)\n\nSafety\nThe Super Duty comes with antilock brakes, massive four-wheel disc brakes and front airbags.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Styling and interior changes are subtle, but the 2023 Ford Super Duty heavy-duty pickup truck continues to push the cutting edge of technology with some stunning new towing systems.\n\nVersus the competition: “Max towing” or “most powerful” numbers don’t mean anything (they change almost monthly), but where the Ford stands out from its competitors is in the remarkable, genuinely useful technology it brings to help owners use their trucks more efficiently and safely.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the importance of the Super Duty lineup of pickup trucks to Ford Motor Co.’s bottom line. They’re massively profitable and extremely popular vehicles, and you can bet it’s their continued influx of profit that’s funding a lot of the company’s shift toward electrified vehicles. But that electrification is skipping the big heavy-duty truck class for now largely because the technology just isn’t ready yet. Instead, gas and diesel engines still rule the land because those are what work for these trucks, and these trucks are what work for people who use their trucks for professional purposes. The Super Duty (available in F-250, F-350 and F-450 versions) is first and foremost a workhorse — 90% of Super Duty owners tow with their trucks, according to Ford, so that’s one area the company has focused on for this update for the 2023 model year. Some new styling, two new engines, and a host of revisions and refinements help keep the Super Duty competitive against a new set of GM pickups also arriving for 2023. So what has Ford done to keep the Super Duty on top?\n\nRelated: 2023 Ford Super Duty: Ford’s Workhorse Gets Some New Grunt and Updated Tech\n\nIs It a Ranger XXL, Or Is the New Ranger a Baby Super Duty?\n\nThe most obvious and perhaps least important aspect of the new ‘23 Super Duty is its updated looks — the family resemblance to the rest of the Ford truck showroom might not be obvious at first, but then have a look at the new 2024 Ranger mid-size pickup that’s just been unveiled and you’ll get it. It looks like a Ranger XXL — or maybe the Ranger is a baby Super Duty now? Either way, it’s a big, boxy truck with a big, boxy look. The sides and rear are slightly cleaner, as well, but it still pretty much looks like the outgoing truck, with the big C-channel-style LED running lights up front and a multitude of trim levels to choose from, each with their own grille and wheel styles. The Super Duty styling wasn’t broken, so nobody tried to fix anything — unlike the revisions to the latest GM trucks, which saw some pretty significant changes from the last update to the current one, as the styling of the last ones was rather controversial.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore Significant Changes Inside\n\nThe updates to the cabin are a bit more significant than the ones to the styling, but they are again evolutionary, as they should be. Cabin materials have taken another step up the niceness ladder but still fall short of the benchmark Ram HD cabins when you compare the top luxury trim levels. Ford needs to figure out how to make the cheap, smooth plastic on the dash, consoles and doors not feel like cheap, smooth plastic. The leather quality in trims like the Platinum and King Ranch (especially the latter) is excellent, the colors are on point and the new interior styling is top notch, too. Comfort is also excellent, with big, supportive seats and more cabin room for passengers than you could possibly ever need.\n\nThe controls adjustability is also superior to that of the GM trucks — the steering wheel and seats seem to have more adjustability, and visibility is notably better than the GM trucks. A lower hood, taller windshield and lower beltline make it feel like you have more glass than steel around you, making it easier to see out.\n\nThe big new displays inside are also excellent. Ford is sticking with its own proprietary Sync 4 multimedia system, not yet going to Google Built-In as some automakers have, and that’s a good thing. It simply works better than the Google-based systems I’ve tried in GM’s trucks; it also has better resolution and is easier to reconfigure. Most of the trucks I sampled during the introduction to the Super Duty at Ford’s Michigan Proving Grounds north of Detroit were Lariat-trimmed and above, so they featured the big new 12-inch touchscreen paired with a 12-inch digital instrument cluster that’s standard on all trims. It’s augmented by the new optional full-color head-up display that adds yet another futuristic dimension to the new truck. And thankfully, there are still plenty of hard buttons and knobs for more frequently used controls, so you’re not constantly trying to use touchscreen controls.\n\nA Bit More Grunt\n\nThere’s a choice of four engines in the Super Duty, including a new base engine: a standard 6.8-liter gasoline V-8 engine making 405 horsepower and 445 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard 10-speed automatic transmission that’s used with all of the engines. You can upgrade to a carryover 7.3-liter gas V-8 engine making 430 hp and 485 pounds-feet of torque, but if you’re like the majority of Super Duty owners, you’re going to opt for the diesel powerplant. The entry diesel is a turbocharged 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 with 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 pounds-feet of torque, but you can also upgrade to the new high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8 that makes a lunatic 500 hp and 1,200 pounds-feet of torque. That’s just about enough torque to shift the orbit of the moon, but it’ll probably be upstaged next week when Ram or Chevy somehow find a bit more power out of their own diesel engines so that they’re the class leader for a while. Chasing the “most powerful” prize is a fool’s errand; at those high levels of torque, everything seems to operate the same anyway — incredibly capably.\n\nThat’s how the Super Duty works, at any rate. At Ford’s proving grounds, we were able to sample the new Super Duty performing all manner of workhorse tasks: I towed a 40,000-pound gooseneck trailer up and down a 7% grade with no problem whatsoever. I also towed a slightly lesser 30,000-pound trailer in a much more commonly available trim combination of the Super Duty, also with no problem or difficulty. Yeah, the big diesel is breathing hard, but that roar is actually the massive cooling system doing its job and keeping the big diesel mill nicely chilled. It will actually accelerate up that 7% grade with your foot to the floor while lugging the big trailer, that’s how much torque you have to play with. It’s practically overkill, but if it were me out in the real world lugging something that heavy, overkill with torque is exactly what I’d want. The thing is, who is actually towing a 40,000-pound trailer on a public road with a pickup? That, to me, seems like the kind of thing you do with a Class B truck, but you can certainly do it with a Super Duty, as well (provided you have a commercial driver’s license).\n\nRefinement Is Clear\n\nThe excellent part of driving this new Super Duty is not how it behaves with a huge load behind it; I expect it to be able to achieve amazing feats of strength when pushed to its limits, and it does that without drama. What’s more amazing is that it’s quiet, refined, comfortable and pleasant to drive without a load behind it, which is far more difficult to achieve. In order to have a truck that can perform feats of strength, heavy-duty equipment has to be present, and it often leads to a bouncy ride, a loud engine and steering that’s numb and odd to use. Not so in the new Super Duty; Ford engineers have crafted a truck that’s all-day pleasant to use even when not towing or hauling anything. It drives like a smaller, lighter truck. Both the diesel and, especially, the gas engines are quiet and refined at speed or when accelerating. The transmission isn’t clunky or harsh. The steering feels natural and isn’t overboosted. This might be the closest the Super Duty has ever come to feeling like the light-duty F-150 in recent memory.\n\nWhere it’s not as pleasant is off-road, where its sheer size and weight means it feels like riding an elephant through the woods. The Tremor off-road package first appeared on the Super Duty before proliferating throughout the Ford truck lineup, and it does indeed boost the capability of the Super Duty with a more off-road-ready suspension, 18-inch wheels with 35-inch tires, underbody protection and off-road tuning (including the addition of Trail Turn Assist, which you frankly need off-road given the Super Duty’s massive length). But it’s too big to be an enjoyable experience in the dirt. As a work truck to get you to a logging camp or a remote construction site, it’ll do, but it wouldn’t be my first choice for wheeling through the rough.\n\nWhere the Magic Happens\n\nThe real story of the ‘23 Super Duty isn’t in the powertrain, the numbers or the new cabin, it’s the new technology debuting on the truck that’s going to make it the envy of the industry. We were impressed when Ford first showed us Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a system that, once you’ve set it up, allows you to reverse your pickup and trailer combination using just the backup cameras and a knob on the dash. No trying to figure out if you turn the steering wheel left or right when reversing, what direction that’ll send the trailer. You just use the guidelines to point the trailer in the direction you want it to go, operate the pedals, and everything becomes so much easier.\n\nWell, now there’s something even more jaw-dropping: Using the backup camera and radar sensors in the Super Duty plus some extraordinary computing power, the truck will now automatically back itself up perfectly aligned to hook up a trailer. Line it up in front of the trailer in question, push a few buttons on the touchscreen to activate the newly available Pro Trailer Hitch Assist system, take your feet off the pedals and your hands off the steering wheel, and the truck will back itself up to align a conventional hitch ball with the trailer coupler. All you then need to do is lower the trailer onto the ball, and off you go. There are several step-by-step prompts from the onboard computer along the way, but it completely takes the guesswork and teamwork out of trying to hook up a trailer to your Super Duty. It is perhaps the ultimate marriage-saving device if YouTube videos of amateur boaters launching various crafts is anything to go by.\n\nThat’s not the only bit of brilliant tech to debut. You know how you lose the backup camera in a pickup truck when you have the tailgate down? Maybe you have the tailgate lowered to back up to a loading dock to have a bunch of stuff dropped into the bed? Well, Ford has solved that problem, too, with the new available Tailgate Down Camera and Tailgate Down Reverse Sensing System. They’ve put a second backup camera and radar sensors in the top of the tailgate, meant to activate when the tailgate’s been lowered, so you have full backup camera and sensor functionality. It’s one of those systems that leaves you wondering why nobody’s thought of this before.\n\nThere are a host of other new innovations for the Super Duty, as well, such as a navigation system that can incorporate the size and weight of the trailer you’re towing into directions, helping to avoid low bridges or super-tight corners that might be problematic. The blind spot warning system adds trailer coverage for fifth-wheel and gooseneck setups to detect vehicles alongside the trailer (additional equipment is required, however). There’s an electronic Onboard Scales with Smart Hitch system that automatically measures not only the weight of the payload in the bed, it also can detect if your trailer’s load is balanced properly based on the change in the tongue weight. It even lets you adjust the trailer load and get visual feedback in real-time using the LED taillights as guides. It’s a compilation of astonishingly useful, genuinely usable technology that will make owner-operator’s lives easier and safer.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Ford Super Duty Up Close: More Useful Tech Is Always Good\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD: New Face, New Interior, More Diesel Power, ZR2 on the Way\n2023 Ram 2500 Heavy Duty Rebel Joins the Off-Road Party\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-250\nShop for a 2023 Ford Super Duty F-350\nCome and Get It\n\nThe new Super Duty’s updates should make it even more desirable than the outgoing model, securing its position as the likely sales leader for the segment quite nicely. By offering more choices, more refinement and some game-changing technology, the new Super Duty becomes more useful than ever for a wide, wide range of customers.\n\nPrices vary depending on options and requirements, but suffice it to say that you can spec a Super Duty from the base F-250 XL regular-cab 4×2 with the 6.8-liter gas V-8 from $45,865 (all prices include a whopping $1,895 destination charge) all the way up to the F-450 Limited crew-cab 4×4 dually with the high-output 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel for an eye-watering $110,000-plus with options — or anywhere in between, as your needs require and your wallet allows. The number of build combinations is astonishing, but so are the number of uses the Super Duty can fulfill. And with the new 2023 model’s advanced tech, more powerful engines and nicer cabin, it’ll continue to be a useful tool for the foreseeable future.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nFord’s full-size heavy-duty F-Series Super Duty pickup truck offers a choice of three cabs and two bed lengths. Three versions — the F-250, F-350 and F-450 — are offered. The F-Series Super Duty can carry up to six people in certain versions, and two engines are offered: a 385-horsepower, gas 6.2-liter V-8 and a 450-hp, turbo-diesel 6.7-liter V-8. Both engines team with a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 and the Ram 2500 and 3500.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nA Lariat Sport Package features 20-inch wheels, and a new Bang & Olufsen premium stereo replaces the Sony premium audio system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include manual air conditioning, 17-inch steel wheels, a vinyl bench seat and an AM/FM stereo. Available features include power windows and locks, cloth seats, cruise control, Sync connectivity, satellite radio, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot, power-adjustable pedals, remote start, navigation, power running boards, a panoramic moonroof, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Ford F-Series Super Duty?\n\nThe 2019 F-Series Super Duty continues to be a strong player with brag-worthy numbers, but if you’re considering this truck, the updated 2020 F-Series Super Duty might also be of interest. Available in fall 2019, the 2020 F-Series Super Duty offers a new gas 7.3-liter V-8 engine along with an available 10-speed automatic transmission. Enhancements to the exterior are subtle, with updated grille styling, revised taillights and new wheel designs. Automatic emergency braking joins the 2020 F-Series Super Duty’s list of available safety features, too.",
